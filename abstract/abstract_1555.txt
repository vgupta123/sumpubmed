BACKGROUND
identification of specific genes and gene expression patterns important for bacterial survival, transmission and pathogenesis is critically needed to enable development of more effective pathogen control strategies. the stationary phase stress response transcriptome, including many σb-dependent genes, was defined for the human bacterial pathogen listeria monocytogenes using rna sequencing  with the illumina genome analyzer. specifically, bacterial transcriptomes were compared between stationary phase cells of l. monocytogenes 10403s and an otherwise isogenic Δsigb mutant, which does not express the alternative σ factor σb, a major regulator of genes contributing to stress response, including stresses encountered upon entry into stationary phase.


RESULTS
overall, 83% of all l. monocytogenes genes were transcribed in stationary phase cells; 42% of currently annotated l. monocytogenes genes showed medium to high transcript levels under these conditions. a total of  <dig> genes had significantly higher transcript levels in 10403s than in Δsigb, indicating σb-dependent transcription of these genes. rna-seq analyses indicate that a total of  <dig> noncoding rna molecules  are transcribed in stationary phase l. monocytogenes, including  <dig> previously unrecognized putative ncrnas. application of a dynamically trained hidden markov model, in combination with rna-seq data, identified  <dig> putative σb promoters upstream of  <dig> of the  <dig> σb-dependent genes and upstream of the one σb-dependent ncrna. the rna-seq data also enabled annotation of putative operons as well as visualization of 5'- and 3'-utr regions.


CONCLUSIONS
the results from these studies provide powerful evidence that rna-seq data combined with appropriate bioinformatics tools allow quantitative characterization of prokaryotic transcriptomes, thus providing exciting new strategies for exploring transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria.
