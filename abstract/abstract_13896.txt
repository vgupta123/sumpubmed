BACKGROUND
advanced glycation end products generated in the circulation of diabetic patients were reported to affect the function of vascular wall. we examined the effects of advanced glycation end products-bovine serum albumin  on endothelial connexin <dig>  expression and gap-junction communication.


RESULTS
in human aortic endothelial cells  treated with a series concentrations of age-bsa  for  <dig> and  <dig> hours, cx <dig> transcript and cx <dig> protein were reduced in a dose dependent manner. in addition, gap-junction communication was reduced. to clarify the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation, mapks pathways in haec were examined. both a mek <dig> inhibitor  and a p <dig> mapk inhibitor  significantly reversed the reductions of cx <dig> mrna and protein induced by age-bsa. consistently, phosphorylation of erk and p <dig> mapk was enhanced in response to exposure to age-bsa. however, all reversions of down-regulated cx <dig> by inhibitors did not restore the functional gap-junction communication.


CONCLUSIONS
age-bsa down-regulated cx <dig> expression in haec, mainly through reduced cx <dig> transcription, and the process involved activation of erk and p <dig> mapk.
