BACKGROUND
enterohemorrhagic e. coli , a subgroup of shiga toxin  producing e. coli , may cause severe enteritis and hemolytic uremic syndrome  and is transmitted orally via contaminated foods or from person to person. the infectious dose is known to be very low, which requires most of the bacteria to survive the gastric acid barrier. acid resistance therefore is an important mechanism of ehec virulence. it should also be a relevant characteristic of e. coli strains used for therapeutic purposes such as the probiotic e. coli nissle  <dig> . in e. coli and related enteric bacteria it has been extensively demonstrated, that the alternative sigma factor Ïƒs, encoded by the rpos gene, acts as a master regulator mediating resistance to various environmental stress factors.

methods
using rpos deletion mutants of a highly virulent ehec o26:h <dig> patient isolate and the sequenced prototype ehec edl <dig>  of serotype o157:h <dig> we investigated the impact of a functional rpos gene for orchestrating a satisfactory response to acid stress in these strains. we then functionally characterized rpos of probiotic ecn and five rpos genes selected from stec isolates pre-investigated for acid resistance.


RESULTS
first, we found out that atcc isolate  <dig> of ehec edl <dig> has a point mutation in rpos, not present in the published sequence, leading to a premature stop codon. moreover, to our surprise, one stec strain as well as ecn was acid sensitive in our test environment, although their cloned rpos genes could effectively complement acid sensitivity of an rpos deletion mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
the attenuation of sequenced ehec edl <dig> might be of importance for anyone planning to do either in vitro or in vivo studies with this prototype strain. furthermore our data supports recently published observations, that individual e. coli isolates are able to significantly modulate their acid resistance phenotype independent of their rpos genotype.
