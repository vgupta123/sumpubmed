BACKGROUND
pneumococcal adherence to the nasopharyngeal epithelium is a critical step in colonisation and disease. the probiotic bacterium, streptococcus salivarius, can inhibit pneumococcal adherence to epithelial cells in vitro. we investigated the mechanism of inhibition using a human pharyngeal epithelial cell line  following pre-administration of two different strains of s. salivarius.


RESULTS
whilst the bacteriocin-encoding megaplasmids of s. salivarius strains k <dig> and m <dig> were essential to prevent pneumococcal growth on solid media, they were not required to inhibit pneumococcal adherence. experiments testing s. salivarius k <dig> and two pneumococcal isolates  showed that inhibition of 19f may involve s. salivarius-mediated blocking of pneumococcal binding sites: a negative correlation was observed between adherence of k <dig> and 19f, and no inhibition occurred when k <dig> was prevented from contacting epithelial cells. k12-mediated inhibition of adherence by 6a may involve additional mechanisms, since no correlation was observed between adherence of k <dig> and 6a, and k <dig> could inhibit 6a adherence in the absence of cell contact.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that s. salivarius employs several mechanisms, including blocking pneumococcal binding sites, to reduce pneumococcal adherence to pharyngeal epithelial cells. these findings extend our understanding of how probiotics may inhibit pneumococcal adherence and could assist with the development of novel strategies to prevent pneumococcal colonisation in the future.
