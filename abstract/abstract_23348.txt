BACKGROUND
aflatoxins  are potent carcinogenic compounds produced by several aspergillus species, which pose serious threats to human health. as sugar is a preferred carbohydrate source for af production, we examined the possibility of using sugar analogs to inhibit af biosynthesis.


RESULTS
we showed that although d-glucal cannot be utilized by a. flavus as the sole carbohydrate source, it inhibited af biosynthesis and promoted kojic acid production without affecting mycelial growth when applied to a glucose-containing medium. the inhibition occurred before the production of the first stable intermediate, norsolorinic acid, suggesting a complete inhibition of the af biosynthetic pathway. further studies showed that exogenous d-glucal in culture led to reduced accumulation of tricarboxylic acid  cycle intermediates and reduced glucose consumption, indicating that glycolysis is inhibited. expression analyses revealed that d-glucal suppressed the expression of af biosynthetic genes but promoted the expression of kojic acid biosynthetic genes.


CONCLUSIONS
d-glucal as a non-metabolizable glucose analog inhibits the af biosynthesis pathway by suppressing the expression of af biosynthetic genes. the inhibition may occur either directly through interfering with glycolysis, or indirectly through reduced oxidative stresses from kojic acid biosynthesis.
