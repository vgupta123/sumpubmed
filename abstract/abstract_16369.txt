BACKGROUND
this paper provides a simple and rapid method for a protein-clustering strategy. the basic idea implemented here is to use computational geometry methods to predict and characterize ligand-binding pockets of a given protein structure. in addition to geometrical characteristics of the protein structure, we consider some simple biochemical properties that help recognize the best candidates for pockets in a proteinâ€™s active site.


RESULTS
our results are shown to produce good agreement with known empirical results.


CONCLUSIONS
the method presented in this paper is a low-cost rapid computational method that could be used to classify proteins and other biomolecules, and furthermore could be useful in reducing the cost and time of drug discovery.
