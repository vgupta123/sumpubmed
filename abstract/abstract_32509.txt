BACKGROUND
extracting biological information from high-density affymetrix arrays is a multi-step process that begins with the accurate annotation of microarray probes. shortfalls in the original affymetrix probe annotation have been described; however, few studies have provided rigorous solutions for routine data analysis.


RESULTS
using aceview, a comprehensive human transcript database, we have reannotated the probes by matching them to rna transcripts instead of genes. based on this transcript-level annotation, a new probe set definition was created in which every probe in a probe set maps to a common set of aceview gene transcripts. in addition, using artificial data sets we identified that a minimal probe set size of  <dig> is necessary for reliable statistical summarization. we further demonstrate that applying the new probe set definition can detect specific transcript variants contributing to differential expression and it also improves cross-platform concordance.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that our transcript-level reannotation and redefinition of probe sets complement the original affymetrix design. redefinitions introduce probe sets whose sizes may not support reliable statistical summarization; therefore, we advocate using our transcript-level mapping redefinition in a secondary analysis step rather than as a replacement. knowing which specific transcripts are differentially expressed is important to properly design probe/primer pairs for validation purposes. for convenience, we have created custom chip-description-files  and annotation files for our new probe set definitions that are compatible with bioconductor, affymetrix expression console or third party software.
