BACKGROUND
malaria presents a considerable threat to public health. histidine-rich protein  <dig>  is the major protein released into human blood upon infection by plasmodium falciparum. in this study, we aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of hrp  <dig> exon ii and the efficacy of novel monoclonal antibodies  against hrp  <dig> for point-of-care test .

methods
the recombinant protein was expressed in soluble form in e. coli and used to immunize mice for mab production. two igg <dig> mabs  with high affinity, specificity and sensitivity for both native and recombinant hrp  <dig> were selected after fusion of mouse spleen with myeloma cells. the affinity constant of 1a <dig> and 1c <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10-7 l/mol, respectively. subsequently, an immunochromatograhic assay was used for screening of clinical samples in endemic regions of china and myanmar.


RESULTS
the immunochromatographic test retrospectively showed an overall sensitivity of  <dig> %, and specificity of 100%. sensitivity at parasite densities <  <dig>  200– <dig>  and >  <dig> parasites/μl was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 100%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that hrp  <dig> exon ii contains immunogenic sites similar to those of the native antigen and can be used for the development of mabs suitable for malaria diagnosis in endemic communities.
