BACKGROUND
endothelial-specific knockout of the transcription factor serum response factor  results in embryonic lethality by mid-gestation. the associated phenotype exhibits vascular failure in embryos as well as visceral yolk sac  tissues. previous data suggest that this vascular failure is caused by alterations in cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. in the current study, we sought to more carefully address the role of srf in endothelial function and cell contact interactions in vys tissues.


RESULTS
tie2-cre recombinase-mediated knockout of srf expression resulted in loss of detectable srf from vys mesoderm by e <dig> . this loss was accompanied by decreased expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin as well as vascular endothelial cadherin and claudin  <dig>  endothelial-specific components of adherens and tight junctions, respectively. focal adhesion  integrins alpha <dig> and beta <dig> were largely unchanged in contrast to loss of the fa-associated molecule vinculin. the integrin binding partner fibronectin- <dig> was also profoundly decreased in the extracellular matrix, indicating another aspect of impaired adhesive function and integrin signaling. additionally, cells in srf-null vys mesoderm failed to reduce proliferation, suggesting not only that integrin-mediated contact inhibition is impaired but also that srf protein is not required for proliferation in these cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data support a model in which srf is critical in maintaining functional cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in endothelial cells. furthermore, we provide evidence that supports a model in which loss of srf protein results in a sustained proliferation defect due in part to failed integrin signaling.
