BACKGROUND
it is known that insects and crustaceans can carry simultaneous, active infections of two or more viruses without showing signs of disease, but it was not clear whether co-infecting viruses occupied the same cells or different cells in common target tissues. our previous work showed that successive challenge of mosquito cell cultures followed by serial, split-passage resulted in stabilized cultures with 100% of the cells co-infected with dengue virus  and an insect parvovirus  . by addition of japanese encephalitis virus , we tested our hypothesis that stable, persistent, triple-virus co-infections could be obtained by the same process.


RESULTS
using immunocytochemistry by confocal microscopy, we found that je super-challenge of cells dually infected with den and dnv resulted in stable cultures without signs of cytopathology, and with 99% of the cells producing antigens of the  <dig> viruses. location of antigens for all  <dig> viruses in the triple co-infections was dominant in the cell nuclei. except for dnv, this differed from the distribution in cells persistently infected with the individual viruses or co-infected with dnv and den. the dependence of viral antigen distribution on single infection or co-infection status suggested that host cells underwent an adaptive process to accommodate  <dig> or more viruses.


CONCLUSIONS
individual mosquito cells can accommodate at least  <dig> viruses simultaneously in an adaptive manner. the phenomenon provides an opportunity for genetic exchange between diverse viruses and it may have important medical and veterinary implications for arboviruses.
