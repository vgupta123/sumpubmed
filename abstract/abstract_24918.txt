BACKGROUND
the ubiquitously expressed pou homeodomain protein oct- <dig> serves as a sensor for stress induced by irradiation. we found recently that in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells, oct- <dig> also functions as a sensor for cyclic amp . the caudal homeobox gene cdx- <dig> is a transactivator of proglucagon  and pro-insulin genes. oct- <dig> binds to cdx- <dig> promoter and represses its expression. camp elevation leads to increased nuclear exclusion of oct- <dig>  associated with reduced recruitment of nuclear co-repressors to the cdx- <dig> promoter and increased cdx- <dig> expression.


RESULTS
we show in this study that inducing oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide  increased nuclear oct- <dig> content in both pancreatic α and β cell lines, as well as in a battery of other cells. this increase was then attributed to accelerated nuclear import of oct- <dig>  assessed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  using green fluorescence protein  tagged oct- <dig> molecule. h2o <dig> treatment was then shown to stimulate the activities of dna-dependent protein kinase  and c-jun n-terminal kinase . finally, increased oct- <dig> nuclear content upon h2o <dig> treatment in a pancreatic α cell line was associated with reduced cdx- <dig> and gcg mrna expression.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations suggest that oct- <dig> functions as a sensor for both metabolic and stress/survival signaling pathways via altering its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling.
