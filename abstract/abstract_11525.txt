BACKGROUND
rybp  is a zinc finger protein which interacts with the members of the mammalian polycomb complexes. previously we have shown that rybp is critical for early embryogenesis and that haploinsufficiency of rybp in a subset of embryos causes failure of neural tube closure. here we investigated the requirement for rybp in ocular development using four in vivo mouse models which resulted in either the ablation or overexpression of rybp.


RESULTS
our results demonstrate that loss of a single rybp allele in conventional knockout mice often resulted in retinal coloboma, an incomplete closure of the optic fissure, characterized by perturbed localization of pax <dig> but not of pax <dig>  in addition, about one half of rybp-/- <-> rybp+/+ chimeric embryos also developed retinal colobomas and malformed lenses. tissue-specific transgenic overexpression of rybp in the lens resulted in abnormal fiber cell differentiation and severe lens opacification with increased levels of ap-2α and sox <dig>  and reduced levels of βa4-crystallin gene expression. ubiquitous transgenic overexpression of rybp in the entire eye caused abnormal retinal folds, corneal neovascularization, and lens opacification. additional changes included defects in anterior eye development.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies establish rybp as a novel gene that has been associated with coloboma. other genes linked to coloboma encode various classes of transcription factors such as bcor, cbp, chx <dig>  pax <dig>  pax <dig>  six <dig>  ski, vax <dig> and vax <dig>  we propose that the multiple functions for rybp in regulating mouse retinal and lens development are mediated by genetic, epigenetic and physical interactions between these genes and proteins.
