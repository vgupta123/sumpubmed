BACKGROUND
psts is a phosphate-binding lipoprotein that is part of the high-affinity phosphate transport system. streptomyces lividans accumulates high amounts of the psts protein in the supernatant of liquid cultures grown in the presence of different carbon sources, such as fructose or mannose, but not in the presence of glucose or in basal complex medium.


RESULTS
functionality experiments revealed that this extracellular psts protein does not have the capacity to capture phosphate and transfer it to the cell. regulation of the psts promoter was studied with northern blot experiments, and protein levels were detected by western blot analysis. we observed that the psts gene was expressed in cultures containing glucose or fructose, but not in complex basal medium. northern blot analyses revealed that the pst operon  was transcribed as a whole, although higher transcript levels of psts relative to those of the other genes of the operon  were observed. deletion of the -329/- <dig> fragment of the psts promoter, including eight degenerated repeats of a sequence of  <dig> nucleotides, resulted in a two-fold increase in the expression of this promoter, suggesting a regulatory role for this region. additionally, deletion of the fragment corresponding to the pho boxes recognized by the phop regulator  resulted in constitutive psts expression that was independent of this regulator. thus, the phop-independent expression of the psts gene makes this system different from all those studied previously.


CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> - in s. lividans, only the psts protein bound to the cell has the capacity to bind phosphate and transfer it there, whereas the psts form accumulated in the supernatant lacks this capacity.  <dig> - the stretch of eight degenerated repeats present in the psts promoter may act as a binding site for a repressor.  <dig> - there is a basal expression of the psts gene that is not controlled by the main regulator: phop.
