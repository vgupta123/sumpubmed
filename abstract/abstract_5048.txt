BACKGROUND
notch signaling is highly conserved in the metazoa and is critical for many cell fate decisions. notch activation occurs following ligand binding to notch extracellular domain. in vitro binding assays have identified epidermal growth factor  repeats  <dig> and  <dig> as the ligand binding domain of drosophila notch. here we show that an internal deletion in mouse notch <dig> of egf repeats 8â€“ <dig>  including the putative ligand binding domain , is an inactivating mutation in vivo. we also show that maternal and zygotic notch1lbd/lbd mutant embryos develop through gastrulation to mid-gestation.


RESULTS
notch1lbd/lbd embryos died at mid-gestation with a phenotype indistinguishable from notch <dig> null mutants. in embryonic stem  cells, notch1lbd was expressed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to wild type notch <dig>  but delta <dig> binding was reduced to the same level as in notch <dig> null cells. in an es cell co-culture assay, notch signaling induced by jagged <dig> or delta <dig> was reduced to a similar level in notch1lbdand notch <dig> null cells. however, the notch1lbd/lbd allele was expressed similarly to wild type notch <dig> in notch1lbd/lbd es cells and embryos at e <dig> , indicating that notch <dig> signaling is not essential for the notch <dig> gene to be expressed. in addition, maternal and zygotic notch <dig> mutant blastocysts developed through gastrulation.


CONCLUSIONS
mouse notch <dig> lacking the ligand binding domain is expressed at the cell surface but does not signal in response to the canonical notch ligands delta <dig> and jagged <dig>  homozygous notch1lbd/lbd mutant embryos die at ~e <dig> similar to notch <dig> null embryos. while notch <dig> is expressed in oocytes and blastocysts, notch <dig> signaling via canonical ligands is dispensable during oogenesis, blastogenesis, implantation and gastrulation.
