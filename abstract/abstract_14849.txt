BACKGROUND
appropriate regulation of respective gene expressions is a bottleneck for the realization of artificial biological systems inside living cells. the modification of several promoter sequences is required to achieve appropriate regulation of the systems. however, a time-consuming process is required for the insertion of an operator, a binding site of a protein for gene expression, to the gene regulatory region of a plasmid. thus, a standardized method for integrating operator sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid is required.


RESULTS
we developed a standardized method for integrating operator sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid and constructed a synthetic promoter that functions as a genetic and gate. by standardizing the regulatory region of a plasmid and the operator parts, we established a platform for modular assembly of the operator parts. moreover, by assembling two different operator parts on the regulatory region, we constructed a regulatory device with an and gate function.


CONCLUSIONS
we implemented a new standard to assemble operator parts for construction of functional genetic logic gates. the logic gates at the molecular scale have important implications for reprogramming cellular behavior.
