BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rna molecules that downregulate gene expression by base pairing to the 3′-untranslated region  of target messenger rnas . up to now, rare information for the mirnas is available in decapod crustaceans. our previous studies showed that many mirna-binding sites are present in the 3′-utr of the cyclin b in the chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis, suggesting that the translation or post-transcription of the crab cyclin b might be regulated by mirnas during meiosis of oocyte.


RESULTS
to identify ovarian mirnas in the mitten crab, ovarian small rnas were subjected to high-throughput sequencing using an illumina genome analyzer. of  <dig> , <dig> reads,  <dig> known mirnas representing  <dig> mirna families were identified and  <dig> novel mirna candidates were predicted. the 5′ seed sequences of four mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were revealed to complementary to mirna binding sites in 3′-utr of the cyclin b. quantitative real time pcr analysis showed that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are much more abundant in the first metaphase  of meiosis than in germinal vesicle  stage. but their increasing expressions are independent of induction of gonadotropin-releasing hormone . further expression analysis using double-luciferase reporter genes assay showed that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> can downregulate the 3′-utrs of the crab cyclin b gene, indicating that they could inhibit the translation of the cyclin b. western blot analysis confirmed that cyclin b protein is completely disappeared in fertilized egg at the metaphase-anaphase transition of meiosis i, suggesting that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> could function in destruction of cyclin b near the end of mi.


CONCLUSIONS
a high number of mirnas have been identified from the crab ovarian small rna transcriptom for the first time. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> exhibit differential expression during the meiotic maturation of the oocytes and have activity in regulating the 3′-utr of the crab cyclin b gene. this result is inconsistent with recent finding that mirna activity is globally suppressed in mouse oocytes.
