BACKGROUND
african swine fever  is one of the most complex viral diseases affecting both domestic and wild pigs. it is caused by asf virus , the only dna virus which can be efficiently transmitted by an arthropod vector, soft ticks of the genus ornithodoros. these ticks can be part of asfv-transmission cycles, and in europe, o. erraticus was shown to be responsible for long-term maintenance of asfv in spain and portugal. in  <dig>  the disease has been reintroduced into the european union, affecting domestic pigs and, importantly, also the eurasian wild boar population. in a first attempt to assess the risk of a tick-wild boar transmission cycle in central europe that would further complicate eradication of the disease, over  <dig> pre-existing serum samples from wild boar hunted in four representative german federal states were investigated for the presence of antibodies directed against salivary antigen of ornithodoros erraticus ticks using an indirect elisa format.


RESULTS
out of these samples,  <dig> reacted with moderate to high optical densities that could be indicative of tick bites in sampled wild boar. however, these samples did not show a spatial clustering  and were of bad quality . furthermore, all positive samples came from areas with suboptimal climate for soft ticks. for this reason, false positive reactions are likely.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the study did not provide stringent evidence for soft tick-wild boar contact in the investigated german federal states and thus, a relevant involvement in the epidemiology of asf in german wild boar is unlikely. this fact would facilitate the eradication of asf in the area, although other complex relations  need to be considered.
