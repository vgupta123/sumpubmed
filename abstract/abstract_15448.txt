BACKGROUND
a recent study yielded first evidence that personality plays an important role in explaining the influence of a prominent apoe polymorphism on cognitive decline and alzheimer’s disease  in elderly humans. adding to this, two earlier studies examined this polymorphism in the context of individual differences in temperament traits in young humans with mixed results. in general, research linking the prominent apoe ϵ <dig>  ϵ <dig> and ϵ <dig> variants and human personality is of special interest, because an influence of this gene and its prominent polymorphism on personality in young adulthood could be of diagnostic value to predict ad and its development in later years.


RESULTS
in the present study n =  <dig> participants provided buccal swabs and filled in a self-report inventory measuring the five factor model of personality. no association between common genetic variations of the apoe gene  and personality could be observed. the remaining genotypes, including the high risk constellation ϵ4/ϵ <dig> for ad, were too seldom to be tested.


CONCLUSIONS
in sum, the present study yielded no evidence for a direct link between common genetic variants of the apoe gene and personality in young adulthood.
