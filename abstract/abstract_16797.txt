BACKGROUND
mig <dig> has been described as a transcriptional factor that in the absence of mig <dig> protein is required for glucose repression of the suc <dig> gene. recently it has been reported that mig <dig> has two different subcellular localizations. in high-glucose conditions it is a nuclear modulator of several mig1-regulated genes, but in low-glucose most of the mig <dig> protein accumulates in mitochondria. thus, the mig <dig> protein enters and leaves the nucleus in a glucose regulated manner. however, the mechanism by which mig <dig> enters into the nucleus was unknown until now.


RESULTS
here, we report that the mig <dig> protein is an import substrate of the carrier kap <dig> . the mig <dig> nuclear import mechanism bypasses the requirement for kap <dig>  as an adaptor protein, since mig <dig> directly binds to kap <dig> in the presence of gsp <dig>  we also show that the mig <dig> nuclear import and the binding of mig <dig> with kap <dig> are not glucose-dependent processes and require a basic nls motif, located between lysine- <dig> and arginine- <dig>  mig <dig> interaction with kap <dig> was assessed in vitro using purified proteins, demonstrating that importin-β, together with the gtp-binding protein gsp <dig>  is able to mediate efficient mig2-kap <dig> interaction in the absence of the importin-α . it was also demonstrated, that the directionality of mig <dig> transport is regulated by association with the small gtpase gsp <dig> in the gdp- or gtp-bound forms, which promote cargo recognition and release, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the mig <dig> protein accumulates in the nucleus through a kap <dig> and nls-dependent nuclear import pathway, which is independent of importin-α in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
