BACKGROUND
although the pattern of lateral organ formation from apical meristems establishes species-specific plant architecture, the positional information that confers cell fate to cells as they transit to the meristem flanks where they differentiate, remains largely unknown. we have combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting and rna-seq to characterise the cell-type-specific transcriptome at the earliest developmental time-point of lateral organ formation using dornrÖschen-like::gfp to mark founder-cell populations at the periphery of the inflorescence meristem  in apetala <dig> cauliflower double mutants, which overproliferate ims.


RESULTS
within the lateral organ founder-cell population at the inflorescence meristem, floral primordium identity genes are upregulated and stem-cell identity markers are downregulated. additional differentially expressed transcripts are involved in polarity generation and boundary formation, and in epigenetic and post-translational changes. however, only subtle transcriptional reprogramming within the global auxin network was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptional network of differentially expressed genes supports the hypothesis that lateral organ founder-cell specification involves the creation of polarity from the centre to the periphery of the im and the establishment of a boundary from surrounding cells, consistent with bract initiation. however, contrary to the established paradigm that sites of auxin response maxima pre-pattern lateral organ initiation in the im, auxin response might play a minor role in the earliest stages of lateral floral initiation.
