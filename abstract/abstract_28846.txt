BACKGROUND
the multidrug resistance protein abcc11/mrp <dig> is expressed in physiological barriers and tumor breast tissues in which it secretes various substrates including cgmp  and 5fdump , the active metabolite of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil .

previously, we described that abcc <dig> high levels are associated to the estrogen receptor  expression level in breast tumors and in cell lines resistant to tamoxifen. consequently, by lowering the intracellular concentration of anticancer drugs, abcc <dig> likely promotes a multidrug resistance  phenotype and decreases efficiency of anticancer therapy of 5fdump. since no experimental data about binding sites of abcc <dig> substrate are available, we decided to in silico localize putative substrate interaction sites of the nucleotide derivatives. taking advantage of molecular dynamics simulation, we also analysed their evolution under computational physiological conditions and during the time.


RESULTS
since abcc <dig> crystal structure is not resolved yet, we used the x-ray structures of the mouse mdr <dig>  and of the bacterial homolog sav <dig> to generate two independent abcc <dig> homology models in inward- and outward-facing conformations. based on docking analyses, two putative binding pockets, for cgmp and 5fdump, were localized in both inward- and outward-facing conformations. furthermore, based on our 3d models, and available biochemical data from homologous transporters, we identified several residues, potentially critical in abcc <dig> transport function. additionally, molecular dynamics simulation on our inward-facing model revealed for the first time conformation changes assumed to occur during transport process.


CONCLUSIONS
abcc <dig> would present two binding sites for cgmp and for 5fdump. substrates likely first bind at the intracellular side of the transmembrane segment while abcc <dig> is open forward the cytoplasm . then, along with conformational changes, it would pass through abcc <dig> and fix the second site , until the protein open itself to the extracellular space and allow substrate release.
