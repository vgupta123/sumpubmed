BACKGROUND
the allotetraploid cotton originated from one hybridization event between an extant progenitor of gosssypium herbaceum  or g. arboreum  and another progenitor, g. raimondii ulbrich  1– <dig>  million years ago . the apetala2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein  transcription factors constitute one of the largest and most conserved gene families in plants. they are characterized by their ap <dig> domain, which comprises 60– <dig> amino acids, and are classified into four main subfamilies: the apetala <dig> , related to abi3/vp <dig> , dehydration-responsive element binding protein  and ethylene-responsive factor  subfamilies. the ap2/erebp genes play crucial roles in plant growth, development and biotic and abiotic stress responses. hence, understanding the molecular characteristics of cotton stress tolerance and gene family expansion would undoubtedly facilitate cotton resistance breeding and evolution research.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> ap2/erebp genes were identified in the g. raimondii  cotton genome. the protein domain architecture and intron/exon structure are simple and relatively conserved within each subfamily. they are distributed throughout all chromosomes but are clustered on various chromosomes due to genomic tandem duplication. we identified  <dig> tandem duplicated genes and  <dig> segmental duplicated gene pairs which contributed to the expansion of ap2/erebp superfamily. of them, tandem duplication was the most important force of the expansion of the b <dig> group. transcriptome analysis showed that  <dig> ap2/erebp genes were expressed in at least one tested g. hirsutum tm- <dig> tissues. in g. hirsutum,  <dig> non-repeated genes of the dreb and erf subfamily genes were responsive to different stresses:  <dig> genes were induced by cold,  <dig> genes by drought and  <dig> genes by heat. qrt-pcr confirmed that  <dig> ghdreb and  <dig> gherf genes were induced by cold and/or drought. no transcripts detected for  <dig> of the  <dig> tandem duplicated genes in tm- <dig>  in addition, some homoeologous genes showed biased expression toward either a-or d-subgenome.


CONCLUSIONS
the ap2/erebp genes were obviously expanded in gossypium. the ghdreb and gherf genes play crucial roles in cotton stress responses. our genome-wide analysis of ap2/erebp genes in cotton provides valuable information for characterizing the molecular functions of ap2/erebp genes and reveals insights into their evolution in polyploid plants.
