BACKGROUND
secreted frizzled-related proteins  are a family of proteins that block the wnt signaling pathway and loss of sfrp <dig> expression is found in breast cancer along with a multitude of other human cancers. activated wnt signaling leads to inappropriate mammary gland development and mammary tumorigenesis in mice. when sfrp <dig> is knocked down in immortalized non-malignant mammary epithelial cells, the cells exhibit a malignant phenotype which resembles the characteristics observed in metastatic breast cancer stem-like cells. however, the effects of sfrp <dig> loss on mammary gland development in vivo are yet to be elucidated. the work described here was initiated to investigate the role of sfrp <dig> in mammary gland development and whether sfrp1−/− mice exhibit changes in mammary gland morphology and cell signaling pathways shown to be associated with sfrp <dig> loss in vitro.


RESULTS
 <dig> week old nulliparous sfrp1−/− mammary glands exhibited branching with clear lobulo-alveolar development, which normally only occurs in hormonally stimulated mid-pregnant wt mammary glands. explant cultures of sfrp1−/− mammary glands display increased levels of a well known wnt signaling target gene, axin <dig>  histomorphologic evaluation of virgin glands revealed that by  <dig> weeks of age, the duct profile is markedly altered in sfrp1−/− mice showing a significantly higher density of ducts with distinct alveoli present throughout the mammary gland, and with focal ductal epithelial hyperplasia. these findings persist as the mice age and are evident at  <dig> weeks of age. changes in gene expression, including c-myc, tgfβ- <dig>  wnt <dig>  rankl, and rspo <dig> early in mammary gland development are consistent with the excessive hyper branching phenotype. finally, we found that loss of sfrp <dig> significantly increases the number of mammary epithelial cells capable of mammosphere formation.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that sfrp <dig> gene is critical for maintaining proper mammary gland development, and that reduced levels of sfrp <dig> results in hyperplastic lesions and its loss may be a critical event in cancer initiation.
