BACKGROUND
identifying the functional importance of the millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the human genome is a difficult challenge. therefore, a reverse strategy, which identifies functionally important snps by virtue of the bimodal abundance across the human population of the snp-related mrnas will be useful. those mrna transcripts that are expressed at two distinct abundances in proportion to snp allele frequency may warrant further study. matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  is important in both normal development and in numerous pathologies. although much research has been conducted to investigate the expression of mmp <dig> in many different cell types and conditions, the regulation of its expression is still not fully understood.


RESULTS
in this study, we used a novel but straightforward method based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify bimodally expressed transcripts in human umbilical vein endothelial cell  microarray data from  <dig> individuals. we found that mmp <dig> mrna abundance was bimodally distributed in un-treated huvecs and showed a bimodal response to inflammatory mediator treatment. rt-pcr and mmp <dig> activity assays confirmed the bimodal regulation and dna sequencing of  <dig> individuals identified an mmp <dig> gene promoter polymorphism that segregated precisely with the mmp <dig> bimodal expression. chromatin immunoprecipation  experiments indicated that the transcription factors  ets <dig>  ets <dig> and gata <dig>  bind to the mmp <dig> promoter in the region of this polymorphism and may contribute to the bimodal expression.


CONCLUSIONS
we describe a simple method to identify putative bimodally expressed rnas from transcriptome data that is effective yet easy for non-statisticans to understand and use. this method identified bimodal endothelial cell expression of mmp <dig>  which appears to be biologically significant with implications for inflammatory disease.
