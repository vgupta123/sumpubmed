BACKGROUND
we present an infinite mixture-of-experts model to find an unknown number of sub-groups within a given patient cohort based on survival analysis. the effect of patient features on survival is modeled using the cox’s proportionality hazards model which yields a non-standard regression component. the model is able to find key explanatory factors  for each sub-group by enforcing sparsity on the regression coefficients via the bayesian group-lasso.


RESULTS
simulated examples justify the need of such an elaborate framework for identifying sub-groups along with their key characteristics versus other simpler models. when applied to a breast-cancer dataset consisting of survival times and protein expression levels of patients, it results in identifying two distinct sub-groups with different survival patterns  along with the respective sets of compound markers.


CONCLUSIONS
the unified framework presented here, combining elements of cluster and feature detection for survival analysis, is clearly a powerful tool for analyzing survival patterns within a patient group. the model also demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing complex interactions which can contribute to definition of novel prognostic compound markers.
