BACKGROUND

b. cereus are of particular interest in food safety and public health because of their capacity to cause food spoilage and disease through the production of various toxins. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, virulence factor genes and antibiotic resistance profile of b. cereus sensu lato isolated from cattle grazing soils and dairy products in ghana. a total of  <dig> samples made up of  <dig> soil collected from cattle grazing farm land,  <dig> raw milk,  <dig> nunu  and  <dig> woagashie . ninety-six b. cereus sensu lato isolates from  <dig> positive samples were screened by pcr for the presence of  <dig> enterotoxigenic genes , and one emetic gene . phenotypic resistance to  <dig> antibiotics were also determined for  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato isolates.


RESULTS
about 72% , 47% , 35%  and 39%  were positive for b. cereus sensu lato with mean counts  of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively. the distribution of enterotoxigenic genes revealed that 13%  harboured all three gene encoding for haemolytic enterotoxin hbl complex genes , 25%  possessed no hbl gene, whereas 63%  possessed at least one of the three hbl genes. all three genes encoding for non-haemolytic enterotoxin  were detected in 60%  isolates, 14%  harboured only one gene, 19%  whereas 8% possessed none of the nhe genes. the detection rates of cytk, entfm, and ces genes were  <dig>   <dig> and 9% respectively. bacillus cereus s. l. isolates were generally resistant to β-lactam antibiotics such as ampicillin , oxacillin , penicillin , amoxicillin , and cefepime  but susceptible to other antibiotics tested.


CONCLUSIONS

bacillus cereus s. l. is prevalent in soil, raw milk and dairy products in ghana. however, loads are at levels considered to be safe for consumption. various enterotoxin genes associated with virulence of b. cereus are widespread among the isolates.
