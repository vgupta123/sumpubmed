BACKGROUND
pediocin-like bacteriocins, ribosomally-synthesized antimicrobial peptides, are generally coexpressed with cognate immunity proteins in order to protect the bacteriocin-producer from its own bacteriocin. as a step for understanding the mode of action of immunity proteins, we determined the crystal structure of pedb, a pediocin-like immunity protein conferring immunity to pediocin pp- <dig> 


RESULTS
the  <dig>  Å crystal structure of pedb reveals that pedb consists of an antiparallel four-helix bundle with a flexible c-terminal end. pedb shows structural similarity to an immunity protein against enterocin a  but some disparity to an immunity protein against carnobacteriocin b <dig>  in both the c-terminal conformation and the local structure constructed by α <dig>  α <dig>  and their connecting loop. structure-inspired mutational studies reveal that deletion of the last seven residues of the c-terminus of pedb almost abolished its immunity activity.


CONCLUSIONS
the fact that pedb, enta-im, and imb <dig> share a four-helix bundle structure strongly suggests the structural conservation of this motif in the pediocin-like immunity proteins. the significant difference in the core structure and the c-terminal conformation provides a structural basis for the classification of pediocin-like immunity proteins. our mutational study using c-terminal-shortened pedbs and the investigation of primary sequence of the c-terminal region, propose that several polar or charged residues in the extreme c-terminus of pedb which is crucial for the immunity are involved in the specific recognition of pediocin pp- <dig>
