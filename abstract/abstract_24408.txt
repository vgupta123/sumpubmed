BACKGROUND
the event-related desynchronization  in eeg is known to appear during motor imagery, and is thought to reflect cortical processing for motor preparation. the aim of this study is to examine the modulation of erd with motor impairment in als patients. erd during hand motor imagery was obtained from  <dig> als patients with a variety of motor impairments. erd was also obtained from age-matched  <dig> healthy control subjects with the same motor task. the magnitude and frequency of erd were compared between groups for characterization of als specific changes.


RESULTS
the erd of als patients were significantly smaller than those of control subjects. bulbar function and erd were negatively correlated in als patients. motor function of the upper extremities did was uncorrelated with erd.


CONCLUSIONS
als patients with worsened bulbar scales may show smaller erd. motor function of the upper extremities did was uncorrelated with erd.
