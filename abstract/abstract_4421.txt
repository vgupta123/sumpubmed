BACKGROUND
the drosophila miranda neo-sex chromosome system is a useful resource for studying recently evolved sex chromosomes. however, the neo-y genomic assembly is fragmented due to the accumulation of repetitive sequence. furthermore, the separate assembly of the neo-x and neo-y chromosomes into genomic scaffolds has proven to be difficult, due to their low level of sequence divergence, which in coding regions is about  <dig> %. here, we de novo assemble the transcriptome of d. miranda using rna-seq data from several male and female tissues, and develop a bioinformatic pipeline to separately reconstruct neo-x and neo-y transcripts.


RESULTS
we obtain  <dig>  transcripts from the neo-x and  <dig>  from the neo-y. neo-y transcripts are generally shorter than their homologous neo-x transcripts  and expressed at lower levels. we find that 24% of expressed neo-y transcripts harbor nonsense mutation within their open reading frames, yet most non-functional neo-y genes are expressed throughout all of their length. we find evidence of gene loss of male-specific genes on the neo-x chromosome, and transcriptional silencing of testis-specific genes from the neo-x.


CONCLUSIONS
nonsense mediated decay  has been implicated to degrade transcripts containing pre-mature termination codons  in drosophila, but rampant description of neo-y genes with pre-mature stop codons suggests that it does not play a major role in down-regulating transcripts from the neo-y. loss or transcriptional down-regulation of genes from the neo-x with male-biased function provides evidence for beginning demasculinization of the neo-x. thus, evolving sex chromosomes can rapidly shift their gene content or patterns of gene expression in response to their sex-biased transmission, supporting the idea that sex-specific or sexually antagonistic selection plays a major role in the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes.
