BACKGROUND
nuclear factor-kappa b  is a family of transcription factors that are important in embryonic development, inflammation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer. the  <dig> kda rela subunit is the major transcriptional activator of the nf-kb pathways. whole-body deficiency of rela leads to massive apoptosis of liver hepatocytes and death in utero. to study the role of rela in physiology and in disease states in a manner that circumvents this embryonic lethal phenotype, we have generated a mouse with rela conditional knockout  alleles containing loxp sites that are deleted by activated cre recombinase.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that relacko/cko mice are fertile, do not display any developmental defects and can be crossed with cre-expressing mice to delete rela in a temporal, tissue-specific manner. our mating of relacko/cko mice with zp3-cre transgenic led to embryonic lethality of rela-deficient embryos. in contrast, mating of relacko/cko mice with col1α2-creer mice allowed for the generation of double transgenics which could be stimulated with tamoxifen to induce fibroblast-specific rela deletion in adulthood.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our collective data, we conclude that this novel relacko/cko mouse allows for efficient deletion of rela in a tissue-specific manner. this relacko/cko mouse will be an invaluable tool for deciphering the mechanistic roles of rela in various cells and tissues during development and in disease.
