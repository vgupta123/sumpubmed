BACKGROUND
reports on common mutations in neuroendocrine tumors  are rare and clonality of net metastases has not been investigated in this tumor entity yet. we selected one net and the corresponding lymph node and liver metastases as well as the derivative cell lines to screen for somatic mutations in the primary net and to track the fate of genetic changes during metastasis and in vitro progression.


RESULTS
applying microarray based sequence capture resequencing including  <dig>  exons from of  <dig> cancer-associated genes and high-resolution copy number and genotype analysis identified multiple somatic mutations in the primary net, affecting brca <dig>  ctnnb <dig>  ercc <dig>  hnf1a, kit, mll, rb <dig>  ros <dig>  smad <dig>  and tp <dig>  all mutations were confirmed in the patients’ lymph node and liver metastasis tissue as well as early cell line passages. in contrast to the tumor derived cell line, higher passages of the metastases derived cell lines lacked somatic mutations and chromosomal alterations, while expression of the classical net marker serotonin was maintained.


CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals that both metastases have evolved from the same pair of genetically differing net cell clones. in both metastases, the in vivo dominating “mutant” tumor cell clone has undergone negative selection in vitro being replaced by the “non-mutant” tumor cell population. this is the first report of a bi-clonal origin of net derived metastases, indicating selective advantage of interclonal cooperation during metastasis. in addition, this study underscores the importance to monitor cell line integrity using high-resolution genome analysis tools.
