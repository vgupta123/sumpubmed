BACKGROUND
modifications of dna and histones in various combinations are correlated with many cellular processes. in this study, we investigated the possible relationship between histone h <dig> tetraacetylation, dna methylation and histone h <dig> dimethylation at lysine  <dig> during mitosis in maize root meristems.


RESULTS
treatment with trichostatin a, which inhibits histone deacetylases, resulted in increased histone h <dig> acetylation accompanied by the decondensation of interphase chromatin and a decrease in both global h3k <dig> dimethylation and dna methylation during mitosis in maize root tip cells. these observations suggest that histone acetylation may affect dna and histone methylation during mitosis. treatment with 5-azacytidine, a cytosine analog that reduces dna methylation, caused chromatin decondensation and mediated an increase in h <dig> acetylation, in addition to reduced dna methylation and h3k <dig> dimethylation during interphase and mitosis. these results suggest that decreased dna methylation causes a reduction in h3k <dig> dimethylation and an increase in h <dig> acetylation.


CONCLUSIONS
the interchangeable effects of 5-azacytidine and trichostatin a on h <dig> acetylation, dna methylation and h3k <dig> dimethylation indicate a mutually reinforcing action between histone acetylation, dna methylation and histone methylation with respect to chromatin modification. treatment with trichostatin a and 5-azacytidine treatment caused a decrease in the mitotic index, suggesting that h <dig> deacetylation and dna and h3k <dig> methylation may contain the necessary information for triggering mitosis in maize root tips.
