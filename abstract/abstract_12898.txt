BACKGROUND
cryptomeria japonica d. don is one of the most commercially important conifers in japan. however, the allergic disease caused by its pollen is a severe public health problem in japan. since large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags  in the male strobili of c. japonica should help us to clarify the overall expression of genes during the process of pollen development, we constructed a full-length enriched cdna library that was derived from male strobili at various developmental stages.


RESULTS
we obtained  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  from either one or both ends of  <dig>  clones derived from the cdna library of c. japonica male strobili at various developmental stages. the  <dig>  cdna clones corresponded to  <dig>  transcripts. approximately 80% of the transcripts resembled ests from pinus and picea, while approximately 75% had homologs in arabidopsis. an analysis of homologies between ests from c. japonica male strobili and known pollen allergens in the allergome database revealed that products of  <dig> transcripts exhibited significant homology. approximately 2% of the transcripts appeared to encode transcription factors. we identified twelve genes for mads-box proteins among these transcription factors. the twelve mads-box genes were classified as def/glo/ggm13-, ag-, agl6-, tm3- and tm8-like mikcc genes and type i mads-box genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our full-length enriched cdna library derived from c. japonica male strobili provides information on expression of genes during the development of male reproductive organs. we provided potential allergens in c. japonica. we also provided new information about transcription factors including mads-box genes expressed in male strobili of c. japonica. large-scale gene discovery using full-length cdnas is a valuable tool for studies of gymnosperm species.
