BACKGROUND
the availability of cell lines releasing fluorescent viral particles can significantly support a variety of investigations, including the study of virus-cell interaction and the screening of antiviral compounds. regarding hiv- <dig>  the recovery of such biologic reagents represents a very hard challenge due to the intrinsic cytotoxicity of many hiv- <dig> products. we sought to overcome such a limitation by using a cell line releasing hiv- <dig> particles in an inducible way, and by exploiting the ability of a hiv- <dig> nef mutant to be incorporated in virions at quite high levels.


RESULTS
here, we report the isolation and characterization of a hiv- <dig> packaging cell line, termed 18-4s, able to release valuable amounts of fluorescent hiv- <dig> based virus-like particles  in an inducible way. 18-4s cells were recovered by constitutively expressing the hiv- <dig> nefg3c mutant fused with the enhanced-green fluorescent protein  in a previously isolated inducible hiv- <dig> packaging cell line. the g3c mutation creates a palmitoylation site which results in nefg3c-gfp incorporation into virions greatly exceeding that of the wild type counterpart. upon induction of 18-4s cells with ponasterone a and sodium butyrate, up to  <dig> Î¼g/ml of vlps, which had incorporated about  <dig> molecules of nefg3c-gfp per viral particle, were released into the culture supernatant. due to their intrinsic strong fluorescence, the 18-4s vlps were easily detectable by a novel cytofluorometric-based assay developed here. the treatment of target cells with fluorescent 18- <dig> vlps pseudotyped with different glycoprotein receptors resulted in these becoming fluorescent as early as two hours post-challenge.


CONCLUSIONS
we created a stable cell line releasing fluorescent hiv- <dig> based vlps upon induction useful for several applications including the study of virus-cell interactions and the screening of antiviral compounds.
