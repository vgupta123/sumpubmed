BACKGROUND
arabinan is an important plant polysaccharide degraded mainly by two hydrolytic enzymes, endo-arabinanase and α-l-arabinofuranosidase. in this study, the characterization and application in arabinan degradation of an endo-arabinanase from thermotoga thermarum were investigated.


RESULTS
the recombinant endo-arabinanase was expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig>  and purified by heat treatment followed by purification on a nickel affinity column chromatography. the purified endo-arabinanase exhibited optimal activity at ph  <dig>  and 75°c and its residual activity retained more than 80% of its initial activity after being incubated at 80°c for 2 h. the results showed that the endo-arabinanase was very effective for arabinan degradation at higher temperature. when linear arabinan was used as the substrate, the apparent km and vmax values were determined to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and  <dig> .1 ±  <dig>  μmol ml−1 min− <dig>  respectively , and the calculated kcat value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s− <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides a useful endo-arabinanase with high thermostability andcatalytic efficiency, and these characteristics exhibit a great potential for enzymatic conversion of arabinan.
