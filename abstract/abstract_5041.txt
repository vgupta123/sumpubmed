BACKGROUND
neurotrophins are important regulators of growth and regeneration, and acutely, they can modulate the activity of voltage-gated ion channels. previously we have shown that acute brain-derived neurotrophic factor  activation of neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase b  suppresses the shaker voltage-gated potassium channel  via phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the n and c terminal aspects of the channel protein. it is not known how adaptor proteins, which lack catalytic activity, but interact with members of the neurotrophic signaling pathway, might scaffold with ion channels or modulate channel activity.


RESULTS
we report the co-localization of two adaptor proteins, neuronal src homology and collagen  and growth factor receptor-binding protein  <dig> , with kv <dig>  channel as demonstrated through immunocytochemical approaches in the olfactory bulb  neural lamina. to further explore the specificity and functional ramification of adaptor/channel co-localization, we performed immunoprecipitation and western analysis of channel, kinase, and adaptor transfected human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells . nshc formed a direct protein-protein interaction with kv <dig>  that was independent of bdnf-induced phosphorylation of kv <dig> , whereas grb <dig> did not complex with kv <dig>  in hek  <dig> cells. both adaptors, however, co-immunoprecipitated with kv <dig>  in native ob. grb <dig> was interestingly able to decrease the total expression of kv <dig> , particularly at the membrane surface, and subsequently eliminated the bdnf-induced phosphorylation of kv <dig> . to examine the possibility that the src homology  <dig>  domains of grb <dig> were directly binding to basally phosphorylated tyrosines in kv <dig> , we utilized point mutations to substitute multiple tyrosine residues with phenylalanine. removal of the tyrosines 111â€“ <dig> and  <dig> prevented grb <dig> from decreasing kv <dig>  expression. in the absence of either adaptor protein, channel co-expression reciprocally down-regulated expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of trkb kinase and related insulin receptor kinase. finally, through patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that the bdnf-induced current suppression of the channel was prevented by both nshc and grb <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we report that adaptor protein alteration of kinase-induced kv <dig>  channel modulation is related to the degree of direct protein-protein association and that the channel itself can reciprocally modulate receptor-linked tyrosine kinase expression and activity.
