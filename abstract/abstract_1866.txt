BACKGROUND
scanning force microscopy  allows direct, rapid and high-resolution visualization of single molecular complexes; irregular shapes and differences in sizes are immediately revealed by the scanning tip in three-dimensional images. however, high-throughput analysis of sfm data is limited by the lack of versatile software tools accessible to sfm users. most existing sfm software tools are aimed at broad general use: from material-surface analysis to visualization of biomolecules.


RESULTS
we present sfmetrics as a metrology toolbox for sfm, specifically aimed at biomolecules like dna and proteins, which features  semi-automatic high-throughput analysis of individual molecules;  ease of use working within matlab environment or as a stand-alone application;  compatibility with multimode , nanowizard , asylum , ascii, and tiff files, that can be adjusted with minor modifications to other formats.


CONCLUSIONS
assembled in a single user interface, sfmetrics serves as a semi-automatic analysis tool capable of measuring several geometrical properties  from dna and protein complexes, but is also applicable to other samples with irregular shapes.
