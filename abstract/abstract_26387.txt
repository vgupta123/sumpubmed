BACKGROUND
mdck cells derived from canine kidney are an important experimental model system for investigating epithelial polarity in mammalian cells. monoclonal antibodies against apical gp <dig> and basolateral p <dig> have served as important tools in these studies. however, the molecular identity of these membrane glycoproteins has not been known.


RESULTS
we have identified the sialoglycoprotein gp <dig> as a dog homologue of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule  family. gp <dig> was enriched from tissue culture cells by subcellular fractionation and immunoaffinity chromatography. the identification was based on tandem mass spectrometry and homology based proteomics. in addition, the p <dig> basolateral marker glycoprotein was found to be the Î² subunit of na+k+-atpase.


CONCLUSIONS
gp <dig> has been characterized previously regarding glycosylation dependent trafficking and lipid raft association. the identification as a member of the canine ceacam family will enable synergy between the fields of epithelial cell biology and other research areas. our approach exemplifies how membrane proteins can be identified from species with unsequenced genomes by homology based proteomics. this approach is applicable to any model system.
