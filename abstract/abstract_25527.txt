BACKGROUND
although histone methyltransferases ezh <dig> has been proved to have significant regulatory effect on the immune rejection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, its role in solid-organ transplantation remains uncovered. in this study, we investigate whether histone methylation regulation can impact renal allograft rejection in rat models.


RESULTS
allogeneic rat renal transplantation model  was established, and the recipients were administrated with ezh <dig> inhibitor dznep after transplantation. renal allografts and peripheral blood were collected on day  <dig> after transplantation for histological examination and mechanism investigation. we found that inhibition of ezh <dig> by dznep after transplantation significantly ameliorated acute rejection , with decreased histological injury and reduced inflammatory infiltration in renal allografts. attenuation of ar was due to the prohibited activation of alloreactive t cells, the subsequent impaired production of inflammatory cytokines, and also the elevated apoptosis of alloreactive t cells in both renal allografts and periphery. however, inhibition of ezh <dig> did not increase the regulatory t cells during the ar.


CONCLUSIONS
disruption of ezh <dig> by dznep suppressed the immune responses of alloreactive t cells and ameliorated ar of renal allografts. this suggests a therapeutic potential of targeting histone methyltransferases ezh <dig> in treating allograft rejection after solid organ transplantation.
