BACKGROUND
in differential expression analysis of rna-sequencing  read count data for two sample groups, it is known that highly expressed genes  are more likely to be differentially expressed which is called read count bias . this bias had great effect on the downstream gene ontology over-representation analysis. however, such a bias has not been systematically analyzed for different replicate types of rna-seq data.


RESULTS
we show that the dispersion coefficient of a gene in the negative binomial modeling of read counts is the critical determinant of the read count bias  by mathematical inference and tests for a number of simulated and real rna-seq datasets. we demonstrate that the read count bias is mostly confined to data with small gene dispersions , and many biological replicate data from unrelated samples do not suffer from such a bias except for genes with some small counts. it is also shown that the sample-permuting gsea method yields a considerable number of false positives caused by the read count bias, while the preranked method does not.


CONCLUSIONS
we showed the small gene variance  is the main cause of read count bias  for the first time and analyzed the read count bias for different replicate types of rna-seq data and its effect on gene-set enrichment analysis.
