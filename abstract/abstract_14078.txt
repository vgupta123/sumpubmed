BACKGROUND
because a priori knowledge about function of g protein-coupled receptors  can provide useful information to pharmaceutical research, the determination of their function is a quite meaningful topic in protein science. however, with the rapid increase of gpcrs sequences entering into databanks, the gap between the number of known sequence and the number of known function is widening rapidly, and it is both time-consuming and expensive to determine their function based only on experimental techniques. therefore, it is vitally significant to develop a computational method for quick and accurate classification of gpcrs.


RESULTS
in this study, a novel three-layer predictor based on support vector machine  and feature selection is developed for predicting and classifying gpcrs directly from amino acid sequence data. the maximum relevance minimum redundancy  is applied to pre-evaluate features with discriminative information while genetic algorithm  is utilized to find the optimized feature subsets. svm is used for the construction of classification models. the overall accuracy with three-layer predictor at levels of superfamily, family and subfamily are obtained by cross-validation test on two non-redundant dataset. the results are about  <dig> % to 16% higher than those of gpcr-ca and gpcrpred.


CONCLUSIONS
the results with high success rates indicate that the proposed predictor is a useful automated tool in predicting gpcrs. gpcr-svmfs, a corresponding executable program for gpcrs prediction and classification, can be acquired freely on request from the authors.
