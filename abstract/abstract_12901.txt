BACKGROUND
phi <dig> polymerase based amplification methods provides amplified dna with minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications. rna virus detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi <dig> dna polymerase cannot amplify rna nor small cdna fragments  obtained by reverse transcription of certain viral rna genomes. therefore, ligation of cdna fragments is necessary prior phi <dig> polymerase based amplification. we adapted the quantitect whole transcriptome kit  to our purposes and designated the method as whole transcriptome amplification .


RESULTS
wta successfully amplified cdna from a panel of rna viruses representing the diversity of ribovirus genome sizes. we amplified a range of genome copy numbers from  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> using wta, which yielded quantities of amplified dna as high as  <dig>  μg/μl or  <dig> target copies. the amplification factor varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  we also demonstrated that co-amplification occurred when viral rna was mixed with bacterial dna.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report in the scientific literature showing that a modified wga  approach can be successfully applied to viral genomic rna of all sizes. amplifying viral rna by wta provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of detection compared to random rt-pcr.
