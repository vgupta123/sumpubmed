BACKGROUND
streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus  is an important pathogen causing swine streptococcosis in china. pathogenicity islands  of s. zooepidemicus have been transferred among bacteria through horizontal gene transfer  and play important roles in the adaptation and increased virulence of s. zooepidemicus. the present study used comparative genomics to examine the different pathogenicities of s. zooepidemicus.


RESULTS
genome of s. zooepidemicus atcc <dig>  comprises  <dig> ,264-bp of a single circular chromosome, with a gc content of  <dig> %. comparative genome analysis of sz <dig>  s. zooepidemicus mgcs <dig> , streptococcus equi. ssp. equi.  <dig>  and s. zooepidemicus h <dig>  identified  <dig> sz35246-specific genes, clustered into three toxin-antitoxin  systems pais and one restriction modification system  pai. these four acquired pais encode proteins that may contribute to the overall pathogenic capacity and fitness of this bacterium to adapt to different hosts. analysis of the in vivo and in vitro transcriptomes of this bacterium revealed differentially expressed pai genes and non-pai genes, suggesting that sz <dig> possess mechanisms for infecting animals and adapting to a wide range of host environments. analysis of the genome identified potential sz <dig> virulence genes. genes of the fim iii operon were presumed to be involved in breaking the host-restriction of sz <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
genome wide comparisons of sz <dig> with three other strains and transcriptome analysis revealed novel genes related to bacterial virulence and breaking the host-restriction. four specific pais, which were judged to have been transferred into sz <dig> genome through hgt, were identified for the first time. further analysis of the ta and rm systems in the pais will improve our understanding of the pathogenicity of this bacterium and could lead to the development of diagnostics and vaccines.
