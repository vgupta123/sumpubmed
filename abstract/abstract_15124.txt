BACKGROUND
the cotton bollworm, helicoverpa armigera is one of the most important crop pests worldwide. it has developed high levels of resistance to synthetic insecticides, and hence, bacillus thuringiensis  formulations are used as a safer pesticide and the bt genes have been deployed in transgenic crops for controlling this pest. there is an apprehension that h. armigera might develop resistance to transgenic crops in future. therefore, we studied the role of gut microbes by eliminating them with antibiotics in h. armigera larvae on the toxicity of bt toxins against this pest.


RESULTS
commercial formulation of bt  and the pure cry1ab and cry1ac toxin proteins were evaluated at ed <dig>  lc <dig>  and lc <dig> dosages against the h. armigera larvae with and without antibiotics . lowest h. armigera larval mortality due to bt formulation and the bt toxins cry1ab and cry1ac was recorded in insects reared on diets with  <dig> and 500 μg ml− <dig> diet of each of the four antibiotics , while the highest larval mortality was recorded in insects reared on diets without the antibiotics. mortality of h. armigera larvae fed on diets with bt formulation and the δ-endotoxins cry1ab and cry1ac was inversely proportional to the concentration of antibiotics in the artificial diet. nearly 30% reduction in larval mortality was observed in h. armigera larvae from f <dig> to f <dig> generation when the larvae were reared on diets without antibiotics  and fed on  <dig> % bt or 12 μg cry1ab or cry1ac ml− <dig> diet, indicating development of resistance to bt in the presence of gut microflora. however, there were no differences in larval mortality due to bt, cry1ab or cry1ac across generations in insects when they were reared on diets with 250 μg of each antibiotic ml− <dig> diet .


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that antibiotics which eliminated gut microflora influenced the toxicity of bt towards h. armigera, and any variation in diversity and abundance of gut microflora will have a major bearing on development of resistance to bt toxins applied as foliar sprays or deployed in transgenic crops for pest management.
