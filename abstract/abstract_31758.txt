BACKGROUND
the cwxp motif of transmembrane helix  <dig>  is highly conserved in class a gpcrs. within this motif, w <dig>  is a big star in the theory of the global “toggle switch” because of its key role in the activation mechanism of gpcrs upon ligand binding. with all footlights focused on w <dig> , the reason why the preceding residue, c <dig> , is largely conserved is still unknown. the present study is aimed to fill up this lack of knowledge by characterizing the role of c <dig>  of the cwxp motif.


RESULTS
a complete analysis of available crystal structures has been made alongside with molecular dynamics simulations of model peptides to explore a possible structural role for c <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that c <dig>  does not modulate the conformation of the tm <dig> proline kink and propose that c <dig>  participates in the rearrangement of the tm <dig> and tm <dig> interface accompanying activation.
