BACKGROUND
hmles  serve as excellent model system to interrogate the effect of snail targeted agents that reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition . we had earlier developed a snail-p <dig> interaction inhibitor  that was shown to suppress snail function. in this report, using systems biology and pathway network analysis, we show that gn- <dig> could cause reversal of emt leading to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition  in a well-recognized hmle-snail and kras-hmle-snail models.


RESULTS
gn- <dig> induced met was found to be consistent with growth inhibition, suppression of spheroid forming capacity and induction of apoptosis. pathway network analysis of mrna expression using microarrays from gn- <dig> treated kras-hmle-snail cells showed an orchestrated global re-organization of emt network genes. the expression signatures were validated at the protein level , and rnai studies validated snail dependent mechanism of action of the drug. most importantly, gn- <dig> modulated many major transcription factors  such as inhibition of oncogenic tfs myc, tbx <dig>  nr3c <dig> and led to enhancement in the expression of tumor suppressor tfs such as smad <dig>  dd1t <dig>  cebpa, hoxa <dig>  tfeb, irf <dig>  irf <dig> and xbp <dig>  resulting in met as well as cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
our systems and network investigations provide convincing pre-clinical evidence in support of the clinical application of gn- <dig> for the reversal of emt and thereby reducing cancer cell aggressiveness.
