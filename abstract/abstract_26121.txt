BACKGROUND
the pars/parr two component regulatory system plays critical roles for multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa. it was demonstrated that in the presence of antimicrobials, parr enhances bacterial survival by distinct mechanisms including activation of the mexxy efflux genes, enhancement of lipopolysaccharide modification through the arn operon, and reduction of the expression of oprd porin.


RESULTS
in this study, we report on transcriptomic analyses of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> wild type and pars and parr mutants growing in a defined minimal medium. our transcriptomic analysis provides the first estimates of transcript abundance for the  <dig> coding genes in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  comparative transcriptomics of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and par mutants identified a total of  <dig> genes regulated by pars and parr. results also showed that mutations in the pars/parr system abolished expression of the mexef-oprn operon by down-regulating the regulatory gene mexs. in addition to the known effects on drug resistance genes, transcript abundances of the quorum sensing genes  were higher in both pars and parr mutants. in accordance with these results, a significant portion of the pars/parr regulated genes belonged to the mexef-oprn and quorum sensing regulons. deletion of the par genes also led to increased phenazine production and swarming motility, consistent with the up-regulation of the phenazine and rhamnolipid biosynthetic genes, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our results link the pars/parr two component signal transduction system to mexef-oprn and quorum sensing systems in p. aeruginosa. these results expand our understanding of the roles of the pars/parr system in the regulation of gene expression in p. aeruginosa, especially in the absence of antimicrobials.
