BACKGROUND
metabolically versatile soil bacteria burkholderia cepacia complex  have emerged as opportunistic pathogens, especially of cystic fibrosis . previously, we initiated the characterization of the phenylacetic acid  degradation pathway in b. cenocepacia, a member of the bcc, and demonstrated the necessity of a functional pa catabolic pathway for full virulence in caenorhabditis elegans. in this study, we aimed to characterize regulatory elements and nutritional requirements that control the pa catabolic genes in b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> 


RESULTS
translational fusions of the pa degradation gene promoters with egfp were constructed and introduced in b. cenocepacia k56- <dig>  egfp expression was observed when the reporter strains were grown in minimal media containing glycerol and pa or other compounds expected to proceed through the pa pathway, and in synthetic cf medium . addition of succinate or glucose to the pa containing medium repressed egfp expression. to show that bcal <dig>  a putative tetr-type regulator gene encodes a regulator for the pa genes in b. cenocepacia, we developed a bcal <dig> insertional mutant reporter strain. results show that these strains exhibit fluorescence regardless of the presence of pa in the culture.


CONCLUSIONS
the pa catabolic genes of b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> are induced by pa and other related compounds, are negatively regulated by paar , a tetr-type regulator, and are subjected to catabolic repression by glucose and succinate. as the pa catabolic pathway of b. cenocepacia appears to be induced during growth in synthetic cystic fibrosis medium , further research is necessary to determine the relevance of this pathway in cf-like conditions and in other host-pathogen interactions.
