BACKGROUND
epidermal growth factor  is a key regulatory growth factor activating many processes relevant to normal development and disease, affecting cell proliferation and survival. here we use a combined approach to study the egf dependent transcriptome of hela cells by using multiple long oligonucleotide based microarray platforms  in combination with digital gene expression profiling  with the illumina genome analyzer.


RESULTS
by applying a procedure for cross-platform data meta-analysis based on rankprod and globalancova tests, we establish a well validated gene set with transcript levels altered after egf treatment. we use this robust gene list to build higher order networks of gene interaction by interconnecting associated networks, supporting and extending the important role of the egf signaling pathway in cancer. in addition, we find an entirely new set of genes previously unrelated to the currently accepted egf associated cellular functions.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the use of global genomic cross-validation derived from high content technologies  can be used to generate more reliable datasets. this approach should help to improve the confidence of downstream in silico functional inference analyses based on high content data.
