BACKGROUND
albugo candida is a biotrophic oomycete that parasitizes various species of brassicaceae, causing a disease  with remarkable convergence in behaviour to unrelated rusts of basidiomycete fungi.


RESULTS
a recent genome analysis of the oomycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis suggests that a reduction in the number of genes encoding secreted pathogenicity proteins, enzymes for assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and sulphur represent a genomic signature for the evolution of obligate biotrophy. here, we report a draft reference genome of a major crop pathogen albugo candida  with an estimated genome of  <dig>  mb. this is very similar to the genome size of a necrotrophic oomycete pythium ultimum  but less than half that of h. arabidopsidis . sequencing of a. candida transcripts from infected host tissue and zoosporangia combined with genome-wide annotation revealed  <dig>  predicted genes. most of the predicted genes lack significant similarity with sequences from other oomycetes. most intriguingly, a. candida appears to have a much smaller repertoire of pathogenicity-related proteins than h. arabidopsidis including genes that encode rxlr effector proteins, crinkler-like genes, and elicitins. necrosis and ethylene inducing peptides were not detected in the genome of a. candida. putative orthologs of tat-c, a component of the twin arginine translocase system, were identified from multiple oomycete genera along with proteins containing putative tat-secretion signal peptides.


CONCLUSIONS
albugo candida has a comparatively small genome amongst oomycetes, retains motility of sporangial inoculum, and harbours a much smaller repertoire of candidate effectors than was recently reported for h. arabidopsidis. this minimal gene repertoire could indicate a lack of expansion, rather than a reduction, in the number of genes that signify the evolution of biotrophy in oomycetes.
