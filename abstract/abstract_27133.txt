BACKGROUND
the neurotrophin nerve growth factor  is known to influence the phenotype of mature nociceptors, for example by altering synthesis of neuropeptides, and changes in ngf levels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic pain conditions such as neuropathic pain. we have tested the hypothesis that after partial nerve injury, ngf accumulates within the skin and causes ‘pro-nociceptive’ phenotypic changes in the remaining population of sensory nerve fibres, which could underpin the development of neuropathic pain.


RESULTS
eleven days after chronic constriction injury of the rat mental nerve the intra-epidermal nerve fibre density of the chin skin from had reduced from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm; this slowly recovered to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm on day  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fibres/mm on day  <dig>  cold hyperalgesia in the ipsilateral lower lip was detectable 11 days after chronic constriction injury, although at this time skin  did not differ between sides. at 14 days post-injury, there was a significantly greater  ipsilaterally compared to contralaterally , but there was no behavioural evidence of neuropathic pain at this time-point. by 21 days post-injury, skin  was elevated bilaterally and there was a significant increase in the proportion of trka-positive  intra-epidermal nerve fibres that were immunolabelled for the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide.


CONCLUSIONS
the temporal mismatch in behaviour, skin  and phenotypic changes in sensory nerve fibres indicate that increased  does not cause hyperalgesia after partial mental nerve injury, although it may contribute to the altered neurochemistry of cutaneous nerve fibres.
