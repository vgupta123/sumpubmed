BACKGROUND
image analysis is an essential component in many biological experiments that study gene expression, cell cycle progression, and protein localization. a protocol for tracking the expression of individual c. elegans genes was developed that collects image samples of a developing embryo by 3-d time lapse microscopy. in this protocol, a program called starrynite performs the automatic recognition of fluorescently labeled cells and traces their lineage. however, due to the amount of noise present in the data and due to the challenges introduced by increasing number of cells in later stages of development, this program is not error free. in the current version, the error correction  is performed manually using a graphical interface tool named acetree, which is specifically developed for this task. for a single experiment, this manual annotation task takes several hours.


RESULTS
in this paper, we reduce the time required to correct errors made by starrynite. we target one of the most frequent error types  and train a support vector machine  classifier to decide whether a division call made by starrynite is correct or not. we show, via cross-validation experiments on several benchmark data sets, that the svm successfully identifies this type of error significantly. a new version of starrynite that includes the trained svm classifier is available at http://starrynite.sourceforge.net.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate the utility of a machine learning approach to error annotation for starrynite. in the process, we also provide some general methodologies for developing and validating a classifier with respect to a given pattern recognition task.
