BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is divided into a european and north american genotype. east european prrsv isolates have been found to be of the european genotype, but form different subtypes. in the present study, prrsv was isolated from a belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure and designated "lena". analyses revealed that lena is a new east european subtype  <dig> prrsv isolate. the main purpose of this investigation was to study the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of prrsv .


RESULTS
obvious clinical and virological differences were observed between the animals inoculated with a recent european subtype  <dig> prrsv isolate  and animals inoculated with prrsv . three out of six pigs inoculated with prrsv  had anorexia and low fever at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post-inoculation . high fever, anorexia and depression were prominent signs in most pigs inoculated with prrsv  between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. four pigs out of ten died during the experiment. arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated from lungs of one animal that died, and streptococcus suis was isolated from lungs of one animal that was euthanized. the difference in viral titres in sera from prrsv  and prrsv -infected pigs was statistically significant  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. the highest viral titres in sera ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml for prrsv  whereas they ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml for prrsv .

the replication of prrsv  was further studied in depth. viral titres ranged from  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg to  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg in nasal secretions between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi and from  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg to  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg in tonsillar scrapings between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. high viral titres were detected in lungs , tonsils  and inguinal lymph nodes  until  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively.

to examine the antigenic heterogeneity between the east european subtype  <dig> isolate lena, the european subtype  <dig> strain lelystad and the north american strain us <dig>  sets of monospecific polyclonal antisera were tested in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays  with homologous and heterologous viral antigens. heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres  for antisera against prrsv  at all sampling time points. for antisera against prrsv  and prrsv , heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
lena is a highly pathogenic east european subtype  <dig> prrsv, which differs from european subtype  <dig> lelystad and north american us <dig> strains at both the genetic and antigenic level.
