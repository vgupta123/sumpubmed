BACKGROUND
innovations in biological and biomedical imaging produce complex high-content and multivariate image data. for decision-making and generation of hypotheses, scientists need novel information technology tools that enable them to visually explore and analyze the data and to discuss and communicate results or findings with collaborating experts from various places.


RESULTS
in this paper, we present a novel web <dig>  approach, bioimax, for the collaborative exploration and analysis of multivariate image data by combining the webs collaboration and distribution architecture with the interface interactivity and computation power of desktop applications, recently called rich internet application.


CONCLUSIONS
bioimax allows scientists to discuss and share data or results with collaborating experts and to visualize, annotate, and explore multivariate image data within one web-based platform from any location via a standard web browser requiring only a username and a password. bioimax can be accessed at http://ani.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/bioimax with the username "test" and the password "test1" for testing purposes.
