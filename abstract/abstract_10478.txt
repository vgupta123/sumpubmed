BACKGROUND
right ventricular hypertrophy  is an important complication of chronic lung disease. however, the signal transduction pathways involved as well as the physiological changes to the right ventricle have not been investigated. emphysema was produced in male, syrian golden hamsters by intra-tracheal instillation of  <dig> iu/kg elastase . saline treated animals served as controls .


RESULTS
nine months later, emp hamsters had 75% greater lung volume, and evidence of rvh at the gross and myocyte level , but not left ventricular hypertrophy. serial echocardiographic analysis from baseline to nine months after induction of emphysema revealed increasing right ventricular internal dimension and decreased pulmonary artery acceleration time only in emp hamsters. there was an increase in translocation of pkc βi and pkc ε from cytosolic to membranous cell fractions in rv of emp hamsters. phosphorylation of pkc ε was unchanged. translocation of pkc α and βii were unchanged. emp animals had a 22% increase in phospho-erk 1/ <dig>  but no change in levels of total erk 1/ <dig> compared to con.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that pkc βi, ε and erk 1/ <dig> may play a role in mediating compensated rvh secondary to emphysema and may have clinical relevance in the pathogenesis of rvh.
