BACKGROUND
ionizing radiation is used as a therapeutic option in the treatment of certain neoplastic lesions located, among others, in the pelvic region. the therapeutic doses of radiation employed often result in adverse effects manifesting themselves primarily in the form of genital tract infections in patients or diarrhea. the data available in the literature indicate disorders in the microbial ecosystem caused by ionizing radiation, which leads to the problems mentioned above. in the present study, we examined the influence of ionizing radiation on  <dig> selected strains of bacteria: lactobacillus crispatus, l. fermentum, l. plantarum, l. reuteri, l. acidophilus l. amylovorus, l. casei, l. helveticus, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. salivarius and l. gasseri. this collection of lactobacillus bacteria isolates of various species, obtained from the genital tract and gastrointestinal tract of healthy women, was tested for resistance to therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation.


RESULTS
the species studied, were isolated from the genital tract  and from the anus  of healthy pregnant women. three doses of 3 gy  and 50 gy  were applied.

the greatest differences in survival of the tested strains in comparison to the control group  were observed at the dose of 50 gy. however, the results were not statistically significant. survival decrease to zero was not demonstrated for any of the tested strains.


CONCLUSIONS
therapeutic doses of radiation do not affect the lactobacillus bacteria significantly.
