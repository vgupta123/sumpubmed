BACKGROUND
excessive accumulation of bilirubin contributes to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in rats. heme oxygenase  is one of the rate-limiting enzymes in catabolizing heme to bilirubin. in the present study, we investigated whether suppression of rat ho- <dig>  expression by small interference rnas  reduces bilirubin levels in hyperbilirubinemic rats.


RESULTS
four pairs of sirna targeting rho- <dig> mrna were introduced into brl cells and compared for their inhibitory effect on the expression of rho- <dig> gene and production of rho- <dig> protein. the sirna exhibiting the most potent effect on ho- <dig> expression and activity was then administered intraperitoneally to  <dig> to 9-day-old rats with hyperbilirubinemia. the sirna distributed mostly in the liver and spleen of neonatal rat. serum bilirubin levels and hepatic ho- <dig> expression were further evaluated. systemic treatment of sirna targeting rho- <dig> reduced hepatic ho- <dig> expression and decreased the serum bilirubin levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and sirna decreased the indirect bilirubin levels more effectively than sn-protoporphyrin , an ho- <dig> inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
sirna targeting rho-l attenuates hepatic ho- <dig> expression and serum bilirubin levels. thus this study provides a novel therapeutic rationale for the prevention and treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
