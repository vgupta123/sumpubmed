BACKGROUND
circular chromosome conformation capture  has provided important insights into three dimensional  genome organization and its critical impact on the regulation of gene expression. we developed a new quantitative framework based on polymer physics for the analysis of paired-end sequencing 4c  data. we applied this strategy to the study of chromatin interaction changes upon a  <dig>  mb dna deletion in mouse region 4e <dig> 


RESULTS
a significant number of differentially interacting regions  and chromatin compaction changes were detected in the deletion chromosome compared to a wild-type  control. selected dirs were validated by 3d dna fish experiments, demonstrating the robustness of our pipeline. interestingly, significant overlaps of dirs with ctcf/smc <dig> binding sites and differentially expressed genes were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our pe-4cseq analysis pipeline provides a comprehensive characterization of dna deletion effects on chromatin structure and function.
