BACKGROUND
2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate , formerly regarded as a specific p2y  purinergic receptor agonist, stimulates ca2+ influx and evokes catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells. these cells express p2y and p2x  purinoceptors, with the latter providing an important ca2+ influx pathway. using single cell calcium imaging techniques, we have determined whether 2-mesatp might be a specific p2x receptor agonist in bovine chromaffin cells and assessed the relative role of p2x and p2y receptors on catecholamine secretion from these cells.


RESULTS
atp raised the i in ~50% of the cells. removing extracellular ca2+ suppressed the i-raising ability of 2-mesatp, observed in ~40% of the atp-sensitive cells. this indicates that 2-mesatp behaves as a specific ionotropic purinoceptor agonist in bovine chromaffin cells. the 2-mesatp-induced i-rises were suppressed by ppads. utp raised the i in ~40% of the atp-sensitive cells, indicating that these expressed ca2+-mobilizing p2y receptors. utp-sensitive receptors may not be the only p2y receptors present, as suggested by the observation that ~20% of the atp-sensitive pool did not respond to either 2-mesatp or utp. the average sizes of the atp- and 2-mesatp-evoked i responses were identical in utp-insensitive cells. 2-mesatp stimulated ca2+ influx and evoked catecholamine release, whereas utp elicited ca2+ release from intracellular stores but did not evoke secretion. 2-mesatp-induced secretion was strongly inhibited by cd2+ and suppressed by extracellular ca2+ or na+ removal. ttx inhibited 2-mesatp-evoked secretion by ~20%.


CONCLUSIONS
2-mesatp is a specific p2x purinoceptor agonist and a potent secretagogue in bovine chromaffin cells. activation of 2-mesatp-sensitive receptors stimulates ca2+ influx mainly via voltage-sensitive ca2+ channels. for the most part, these are activated by the depolarization brought about by na+ influx across p2x receptor pores.
