BACKGROUND
increased atmospheric carbon dioxide  levels predicted to occur before the end of the century will impact plant metabolism. in addition, nitrate availability will affect metabolism and levels of nitrogen-containing defense compounds, such as glucosinolates . we compared arabidopsis foliar metabolic profile in plants grown under two co <dig> regimes , nitrate fertilization  and in response to mechanical damage of rosette leaves.


RESULTS
constitutive foliar metabolites in nitrate-limited plants show distinct global patterns depending on atmospheric co <dig> levels; in contrast, plants grown under higher nitrate fertilization under elevated atmospheric co <dig> conditions have a unique metabolite signature. nitrate fertilization dampens the jasmonate burst in response to wounding in plants grown at elevated co <dig> levels. leaf gsl profile mirrors the jasmonate burst; in particular, indole gsls increase in response to damage in plants grown at ambient co <dig> but only in nitrate-limited plants grown under elevated co <dig> conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
this may reflect a reduced capacity of c <dig> plants grown under enriched co <dig> and nitrate levels to signal changes in oxidative stress and has implications for future agricultural management practices.
