BACKGROUND
amyloid-beta  accumulation is a hallmark of alzheimer’s disease  that can lead to neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein  <dig>  is an apoptotic protein that was robustly induced in the transgenic c. elegans ad brains. however, the roles of tnfaip <dig> in ad have not been investigated.


RESULTS
we found tnfaip <dig> protein and mrna levels were dramatically elevated in primary mouse cortical neurons and neuro2a  cells exposed to aβ25– <dig>  knockdown and overexpression of tnfaip <dig> significantly attenuated and exacerbated aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity in n2a cells, respectively. further studies showed that tnfaip <dig> knockdown significantly blocked aβ25–35-induced cleaved caspase  <dig>  whereas tnfaip <dig> overexpression enhanced aβ25–35-induced cleaved caspase  <dig>  suggesting that tnfaip <dig> plays an important role in aβ25–35-induced neuronal apoptosis. moreover, we observed that tnfaip <dig> was capable of inhibiting the levels of phosphorylated akt and creb, and also anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  tnfaip <dig> overexpression enhanced the inhibitory effect of aβ25– <dig> on the levels of p-creb and bcl- <dig>  while tnfaip <dig> knockdown reversed aβ25–35-induced attenuation in the levels of p-creb and bcl- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that tnfaip <dig> contributes to aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity by attenuating akt/creb signaling pathway, and bcl- <dig> expression.
