BACKGROUND
though long non-coding rnas  are emerging as critical regulators of immune responses, whether they are involved in lps-activated tlr <dig> signaling pathway and how is their expression regulated in mouse macrophages are still unexplored.


RESULTS
by repurposing expression microarray probes, we identified  <dig> lncrnas in bone marrow-derived macrophages  and classified them to enhancer-like lncrnas  and promoter-associated lncrnas  according to chromatin signatures defined by relative levels of h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  fifteen elncrnas and  <dig> plncrnas are differentially expressed upon lps stimulation. the expression change of lncrnas and their neighboring protein-coding genes are significantly correlated. also, the regulation of both elncrnas and plncrnas expression is associated with h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac. crucially, many identified lps-regulated lncrnas, such as lncrna-nfkb <dig> and lncrna-rel, locate near to immune response protein-coding genes. the majority of lps-regulated lncrnas had at least one binding site among the transcription factors p <dig>  irf <dig>  junb and cjun.


CONCLUSIONS
we established an integrative microarray analysis pipeline for profiling lncrnas. also, our results suggest that lncrnas can be important regulators of lps-induced innate immune response in bmdms.
