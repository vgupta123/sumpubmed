BACKGROUND
currently there exists a limited availability of genetic marker resources in sweetpotato , which is hindering genetic research in this species. it is necessary to develop more molecular markers for potential use in sweetpotato genetic research. with the newly developed next generation sequencing technology, large amount of transcribed sequences of sweetpotato have been generated and are available for identifying ssr markers by data mining.


RESULTS
in this study, we investigated  <dig>  ests for the identification and development of ssr markers. in total,  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  ssr-containing unique ests. on an average, one ssr was found per  <dig>  kb of est sequence with tri-nucleotide motifs  being the most abundant followed by di- , tetra- , penta-  and hexa-nucleotide  repeat types. the top five motifs included ag/ct , aag/ctt , at/ta , ccg/cgg  and aat/att . after removing possible duplicate of published est-ssrs of sweetpotato, a total of non-repeat  <dig>  ssr motifs were identified. based on these ssr-containing sequences,  <dig>  pairs of high-quality ssr primers were designed and used for validation of the amplification and assessment of the polymorphism between two parents of one mapping population  and eight accessions of cultivated sweetpotatoes. the results showed that  <dig> primer pairs could yield reproducible and strong amplification products, of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  primer pairs exhibited polymorphism between e shu  <dig> hao and guang 2k- <dig> and among the  <dig> cultivated sweetpotatoes, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study gives an insight into the frequency, type and distribution of sweetpotato est-ssrs and demonstrates successful development of est-ssr markers in cultivated sweetpotato. these est-ssr markers could enrich the current resource of molecular markers for the sweetpotato community and would be useful for qualitative and quantitative trait mapping, marker-assisted selection, evolution and genetic diversity studies in cultivated sweetpotato and related ipomoea species.
