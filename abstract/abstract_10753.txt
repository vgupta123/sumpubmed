BACKGROUND
development rates of aedes aegypti are known to vary with respect to many abiotic and biotic factors including temperature, resource availability, and intraspecific competition. the relative importance of these factors and their interactions are not well established across populations. we performed meta-analysis on a dataset of development rate estimates from  <dig> studies.


RESULTS
meta-analytic results indicated that the environmental factor of temperature is sufficient to explain development rate variability in ae. aegypti. while diet and density may greatly impact other developmental phenotypes, these results suggest that for development rate these factors should never be considered to the exclusion of temperature. the effect of temperature on development rate is not homogenous or constant. the sources of heterogeneity of the effect of temperature are difficult to analyze due to lack of consistent reporting of larval rearing methods.


CONCLUSIONS
temperature is the most important ecological determinant of development rate in ae. aegypti, but its effect is heterogeneous. ignoring this heterogeneity is problematic for models of vector population and vector-borne disease transmission.
