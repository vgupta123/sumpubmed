BACKGROUND
the cd <dig> transmembrane glycoprotein is an adp-ribosyl cyclase that moonlights as a receptor in cells of the immune system. both functions are independently implicated in numerous areas related to human health. this study originated from an inherent interest in studying cd <dig> in the cynomolgus monkey , a species closely related to humans that also represents a cogent animal model for the biomedical analysis of cd <dig> 


RESULTS
a cdna was isolated from cynomolgus macaque peripheral blood leukocytes and is predicted to encode a type ii membrane protein of  <dig> amino acids with 92% identity to human cd <dig>  both rt-pcr-mediated cdna cloning and genomic dna pcr surveying were possible with heterologous human cd <dig> primers, demonstrating the striking conservation of cd <dig> in these primates. transfection of the cdna coincided with:  surface expression of cynomolgus macaque cd <dig> by immunofluorescence;  detection of ~ <dig> and  <dig> kda proteins by western blot and  the appearance of ecto-enzymatic activity. monoclonal antibodies were raised against the cynomolgus cd <dig> ectodomain and were either species-specific or cross-reactive with human cd <dig>  in which case they were directed against a common disulfide-requiring conformational epitope that was mapped to the c-terminal disulfide loop.


CONCLUSIONS
this multi-faceted characterization of cd <dig> from cynomolgus macaque demonstrates its high genetic and biochemical similarities with human cd <dig> while the immunological comparison adds new insights into the dominant epitopes of the primate cd <dig> ectodomain. these results open new prospects for the biomedical and pharmacological investigations of this receptor-enzyme.
