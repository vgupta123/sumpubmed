BACKGROUND
tick-borne pathogens cause emerging zoonoses, and include fastidious organisms such as anaplasma phagocytophilum. because of their obligate intracellular nature, methods for mutagenesis and transformation have not been available.


RESULTS
to facilitate genetic manipulation, we transformed a. phagocytophilum  to express a green fluorescent protein  with the himar <dig> transposase system and selection with the clinically irrelevant antibiotic spectinomycin.


CONCLUSIONS
these transformed bacteria  grow at normal rates and are brightly fluorescent in human, monkey, and tick cell culture. molecular characterization of the gfp/ap genomic dna confirmed transposition and the flanking genomic insertion locations were sequenced. three mice inoculated with gfp/ap by intraperitoneal injection became infected as demonstrated by the appearance of morulae in a peripheral blood neutrophil and re-isolation of the bacteria in culture.
