BACKGROUND
among the  <dig> genes encoding autotransporter proteins of the "surface cell antigen"  family in the currently sequenced rickettsia genomes, ompa, sca <dig>  and sca <dig> , have been extensively used for identification and phylogenetic purposes for rickettsia species. however, none of these genes is present in all  <dig> currently validated rickettsia species. of the remaining  <dig> sca genes, sca <dig> is the only gene to be present in all nine sequenced rickettsia genomes. to estimate whether the sca <dig> gene is present in all rickettsia species and its usefulness as an identification and phylogenetic tool, we searched for sca1genes in the four published rickettsia genomes and amplified and sequenced this gene in the remaining  <dig> validated rickettsia species.


RESULTS
sca <dig> is the only one of the  <dig> rickettsial sca genes present in all  <dig> rickettsia species. r. prowazekii and r. canadensis exhibit a split sca <dig> gene whereas the remaining species have a complete gene. within the sca <dig> gene, we identified a 488-bp variable sequence fragment that can be amplified using a pair of conserved primers. sequences of this fragment are specific for each rickettsia species. the phylogenetic organization of rickettsia species inferred from the comparison of sca <dig> sequences strengthens the classification based on the housekeeping gene glta and is similar to those obtained from the analyses of ompa, sca <dig> and sca <dig>  thus suggesting similar evolutionary constraints. we also observed that sca <dig> protein sequences have evolved under a dual selection pressure: with the exception of typhus group rickettsiae, the amino-terminal part of the protein that encompasses the predicted passenger domain, has evolved under positive selection in rickettsiae. this suggests that the sca <dig> protein interacts with the host. in contrast, the c-terminal portion containing the autotransporter domain has evolved under purifying selection. in addition, sca <dig> is transcribed in r. conorii, and might therefore be functional in this species.


CONCLUSIONS
the sca <dig> gene, encoding an autotransporter protein that evolves under dual evolution pressure, is the only sca-family gene to be conserved by all rickettsia species. as such, it is a valuable identification target for these bacteria, especially because rickettsial isolates can be identified by amplification and sequencing of a discriminatory gene fragment using a single primer pair. it may also be used as a phylogenetic tool. however, its current functional status remains to be determined although it was found expressed in r. conorii.
