BACKGROUND
mutations in the lgi <dig> gene predispose to a rare, hereditary form of temporal epilepsy. currently, little is known about the temporal and spatial expression pattern of lgi <dig> during normal embryogenesis and so to define this more clearly we used a transgenic mouse line that expresses gfp under the control of lgi <dig> cis-regulatory elements.


RESULTS
during embryonic brain growth, high levels of lgi <dig> expression were found in the surface ectoderm, the neuroepithelium, mesenchymal connective tissue, hippocampus, and sensory organs, such as eye, tongue, and the olfactory bulb. lgi <dig> was also found in the cranial nerve nuclei and ganglia, such as vestibular, trigeminal, and dorsal ganglia. expression of lgi <dig> followed an orchestrated pattern during mouse development becoming more subdued in areas of the neocortex of the mid- and hind-brain in early postnatal animals, although high expression levels were retained in the choroid plexus and hippocampus. in late postnatal stages, lgi <dig> expression continued to be detected in many areas in the brain including, hippocampus, paraventricular thalamic nuclei, inferior colliculus, and the cerebral aqueduct. we also showed that lgi1-expressing cells co-express nestin, dcx, and beta-iii tubulin suggesting that lgi1-expressing cells are migratory neuroblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations imply that lgi <dig> may have a role in establishing normal brain architecture and neuronal functions during brain development suggesting that it may be involved in neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity, which become more specifically defined in the adult animal.
