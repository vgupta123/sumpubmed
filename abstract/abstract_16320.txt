BACKGROUND

propionibacterium freudenreichii is an actinobacterium widely used in the dairy industry as a ripening culture for swiss-type cheeses, for vitamin b <dig> production and some strains display probiotic properties. it is reportedly a hardy bacterium, able to survive the cheese-making process and digestive stresses.


RESULTS
during this study, p. freudenreichii cirm-bia 138 , which has a generation time of five hours in yeast extract lactate medium at 30 °c under microaerophilic conditions, was incubated for 11 days  in a culture medium, without any adjunct during the incubation. the carbon and free amino acids sources available in the medium, and the organic acids produced by the strain, were monitored throughout growth and survival. although lactate  was exhausted three days after inoculation, the strain sustained a high population level of  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml. its physiological adaptation was investigated by rna-seq analysis and revealed a complete disruption of metabolism at the entry into stationary phase as compared to exponential phase.


CONCLUSIONS

p. freudenreichii adapts its metabolism during entry into stationary phase by down-regulating oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and the wood-werkman cycle by exploiting new nitrogen  sources, by down-regulating the transcription, translation and secretion of protein. utilization of polyphosphates was suggested.
