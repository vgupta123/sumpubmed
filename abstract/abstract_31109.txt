BACKGROUND
multifactorial diseases arise from complex patterns of interaction between a set of genetic traits and the environment. to fully capture the genetic biomarkers that jointly explain the heritability component of a disease, thus, all snps from a genome-wide association study should be analyzed simultaneously.


RESULTS
in this paper, we present bag of na誰ve bayes , an algorithm for genetic biomarker selection and subjects classification from the simultaneous analysis of genome-wide snp data. bonb is based on the na誰ve bayes classification framework, enriched by three main features: bootstrap aggregating of an ensemble of na誰ve bayes classifiers, a novel strategy for ranking and selecting the attributes used by each classifier in the ensemble and a permutation-based procedure for selecting significant biomarkers, based on their marginal utility in the classification process. bonb is tested on the wellcome trust case-control study on type  <dig> diabetes and its performance is compared with the ones of both a standard na誰ve bayes algorithm and hyperlasso, a penalized logistic regression algorithm from the state-of-the-art in simultaneous genome-wide data analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the significantly higher classification accuracy obtained by bonb, together with the significance of the biomarkers identified from the type  <dig> diabetes dataset, prove the effectiveness of bonb as an algorithm for both classification and biomarker selection from genome-wide snp data.
