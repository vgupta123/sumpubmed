BACKGROUND
previously, a bovine intestinal epithelial cell line  was successfully established. this work hypothesized that bie cells are useful in vitro model system for the study of interactions of microbial- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns  with bovine intestinal epithelial cells and for the selection of immunoregulatory lactic acid bacteria .


RESULTS
all toll-like receptor  genes were expressed in bie cells, being tlr <dig> one of the most strongly expressed. we demonstrated that heat-stable pamps of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  significantly enhanced the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-1α and mcp- <dig> in bie cells by activating both nf-κb and mapk pathways. we evaluated the capacity of several lactobacilli strains to modulate heat-stable etec pamps-mediated inflammatory response in bie cells. among these strains evaluated, lactobacillus casei oll <dig> attenuated heat-stable etec pamps-induced pro-inflammatory response by inhibiting nf-κb and p <dig> signaling pathways in bie cells. moreover, l. casei oll <dig> negatively regulated tlr <dig> signaling in bie cells by up-regulating toll interacting protein  and b-cell lymphoma 3-encoded protein .


CONCLUSIONS
bie cells are suitable for the selection of immunoregulatory lab and for studying the mechanisms involved in the protective activity of immunobiotics against pathogen-induced inflammatory damage. in addition, we showed that l. casei oll <dig> functionally modulate the bovine intestinal epithelium by attenuating heat-stable etec pamps-induced inflammation. therefore l. casei oll <dig> is a good candidate for in vivo studying the protective effect of lab against intestinal inflammatory damage induced by etec infection or heat-stable etec pamps challenge in the bovine host.
