BACKGROUND
emergence of multidrug resistance in enterobacteriaceae limits the selection of antimicrobials for treatment of infectious diseases. identification of ndm- <dig> makes more difficulty in treating multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae infections. carbapenem-resistant escherichia coli clinical isolates from a tertiary hospital in wenzhou, east china, were investigated for ndm- <dig> production.


RESULTS
the two tested isolates were negative for modified hodge test, but positive for a double-disc synergy test used for detecting metallo-Î²-lactamase production. e. coli wz <dig> and wz <dig> exhibited discrepant-level resistance to most clinically frequent used antimicrobials, but still susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, fosfomycin, tigecycline and polymyxin b. e. coli wz <dig> and wz <dig> were positive for blandm- <dig> determined by pcr and dna sequencing. other than blandm- <dig>  e. coli wz <dig> also harbored blactx-m- <dig> and blacmy- <dig>  while e. coli wz <dig> simultaneously harbored blashv- <dig> blactx-m- <dig> and blacmy- <dig>  carbapenem resistance for e. coli wz <dig> and wz <dig> could not be transferred to e. coli recipients through conjugation, but could be transferred to e. coli recipients by chemical transformation. the ecor1-digested dna pattern of plasmids from the transformant of e. coli wz <dig> was different from that of e. coli wz <dig>  mlst showed that e. coli wz <dig> and wz <dig> belonged to an animal-associated clone .


CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first report of blandm- <dig> carriage in e. coli st <dig> isolates and coexistence of blandm- <dig> and blacmy- <dig> in same isolate. systemic surveillance should focus on the dissemination of blandm- <dig> among enterobacteriaceae, especially e. coli st <dig> clone associated with animal infection.
