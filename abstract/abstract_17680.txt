BACKGROUND
the sequenced genomes of the brucella spp. have two urease operons, ure- <dig> and ure- <dig>  but there is evidence that only one is responsible for encoding an active urease. the present work describes the purification and the enzymatic and phylogenomic characterization of urease from brucella suis strain  <dig>  additionally, the urease reactivity of sera from patients diagnosed with brucellosis was examined.


RESULTS
urease encoded by the ure- <dig> operon of brucella suis strain  <dig> was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies. the urease was purified 51-fold with a recovery of 12% of the enzyme activity and  <dig> % of the total protein. the enzyme had an isoelectric point of  <dig>  and showed optimal activity at ph  <dig>  and 28–35°c. the purified enzyme exhibited a michaelis-menten saturation kinetics with a km of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm. hydroxyurea and thiourea are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme with ki of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, respectively. acetohydroxamic acid also inhibits the enzyme in a competitive way. the molecular weight estimated for the native enzyme was between 130– <dig> kda by gel filtration chromatography and  <dig> ±  <dig> kda using 5–10% polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel. only three subunits in sds-page were identified: two small subunits of  <dig>  da and  <dig>  da, and a major subunit of  <dig>  da. the amino terminal sequence of the purified large subunit corresponded to the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by urec <dig>  the urec <dig> subunit was recognized by sera from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis. by phylogenetic and cluster structure analyses, urec <dig> was related to the urec typically present in the rhizobiales; in contrast, the urec <dig> encoded in the ure- <dig> operon is more related to distant species.


CONCLUSIONS
we have for the first time purified and characterized an active urease from b. suis. the enzyme was characterized at the kinetic, immunological and phylogenetic levels. our results confirm that the active urease of b. suis is a product of ure- <dig> operon.
