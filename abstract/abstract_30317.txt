BACKGROUND
multiple sequence alignment  is a basic tool for bioinformatics research and analysis. it has been used essentially in almost all bioinformatics tasks such as protein structure modeling, gene and protein function prediction, dna motif recognition, and phylogenetic analysis. therefore, improving the accuracy of multiple sequence alignment is important for advancing many bioinformatics fields.


RESULTS
we designed and developed a new method, msacompro, to synergistically incorporate predicted secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, and residue-residue contact information into the currently most accurate posterior probability-based msa methods to improve the accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. the method is different from the multiple sequence alignment methods  that use the tertiary structure information of some sequences since the structural information of our method is fully predicted from sequences. to the best of our knowledge, applying predicted relative solvent accessibility and contact map to multiple sequence alignment is novel. the rigorous benchmarking of our method to the standard benchmarks  clearly demonstrated that incorporating predicted protein structural information improves the multiple sequence alignment accuracy over the leading multiple protein sequence alignment tools without using this information, such as msaprobs, probcons, probalign, t-coffee, mafft and muscle. and the performance of the method is comparable to the state-of-the-art method promals of using structural features and additional homologous sequences by slightly lower scores.


CONCLUSIONS
msacompro is an efficient and reliable multiple protein sequence alignment tool that can effectively incorporate predicted protein structural information into multiple sequence alignment. the software is available at http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/multicom_toolbox/.
