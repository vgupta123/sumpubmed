BACKGROUND
the construction of genetic linkage maps for cultivated peanut  has and continues to be an important research goal to facilitate quantitative trait locus  analysis and gene tagging for use in a marker-assisted selection in breeding. even though a few maps have been developed, they were constructed using diploid or interspecific tetraploid populations. the most recently published intra-specific map was constructed from the cross of cultivated peanuts, in which only  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers were sparsely populated in  <dig> linkage groups. the more detailed linkage map with sufficient markers is necessary to be feasible for qtl identification and marker-assisted selection. the objective of this study was to construct a genetic linkage map of cultivated peanut using simple sequence repeat  markers derived primarily from peanut genomic sequences, expressed sequence tags , and by "data mining" sequences released in genbank.


RESULTS
three recombinant inbred lines  populations were constructed from three crosses with one common female parental line yueyou  <dig>  a high yielding spanish market type. the four parents were screened with  <dig> primer pairs designed to amplify ssrs and  <dig> primer pairs produced clear pcr products. of the  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> primer pairs  were polymorphic in these populations, respectively, and used in genotyping these ril populations. individual linkage maps were constructed from each of the three populations and a composite map based on  <dig> common loci were created using joinmap. the composite linkage maps consist of  <dig> composite linkage groups  with  <dig> ssr markers , representing the  <dig> chromosomes of a. hypogaea. the total composite map length is  <dig>  cm, with an average marker density of  <dig>  cm. segregation distortion in the  <dig> populations was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the markers, respectively. these distorted loci tended to cluster on lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  there were only  <dig> est-ssr markers mapped due to low polymorphism. by comparison, there were potential synteny, collinear order of some markers and conservation of collinear linkage groups among the maps and with the aa genome but not fully conservative.


CONCLUSIONS
a composite linkage map was constructed from three individual mapping populations with  <dig> ssr markers in  <dig> composite linkage groups. this composite genetic linkage map is among the first "true" tetraploid peanut maps produced. this map also consists of  <dig> ssrs that have been used in the published aa genome maps, and could be used in comparative mapping studies. the primers described in this study are pcr-based markers, which are easy to share for genetic mapping in peanuts. all  <dig> primer pairs are provided as additional files and the three ril populations will be made available to public upon request for quantitative trait loci  analysis and linkage map improvement.
