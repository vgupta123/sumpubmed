BACKGROUND
the anthers and pollen grains are critical for male fertility and hybrid rice breeding. the development of rice mature anther and pollen consists of multiple continuous stages. however, molecular mechanisms regulating mature anther development were poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this study, we have identified  <dig> mature anther-preferentially expressed genes  in rice based on affymetrix microarray data. gene ontology  analysis indicated that ossta genes mainly participated in metabolic and cellular processes that are likely important for rice anther and pollen development. the expression patterns of ossta genes were validated using real-time pcr and mrna in situ hybridizations. cis-element identification showed that most of the ossta genes had the cis-elements responsive to phytohormone regulation. co-expression analysis of ossta genes showed that genes annotated with pectinesterase and calcium ion binding activities were rich in the network, suggesting that ossta genes could be involved in pollen germination and anther dehiscence. furthermore, ossta rnai transgenic lines showed male-sterility and pollen germination defects.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that ossta genes function in rice male fertility, pollen germination and anther dehiscence and established molecular regulating networks that lay the foundation for further functional studies.
