BACKGROUND
in rodents treatment with fibrates causes hepatocarcinogenesis, probably as a result of oxidative stress and an impaired balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation in the liver. there is some debate whether fibrates could also induce liver cancer in species not responsive to peroxisome proliferation. in this study the effect of clofibrate treatment on peroxisome proliferation, production of oxidative stress, gene expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes and proto-oncogenes was investigated in the liver of pigs, a non-proliferating species.


RESULTS
pigs treated with clofibrate had heavier livers , higher peroxisome counts , higher mrna concentration of acyl-coa oxidase , a higher activity of catalase  but lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide  in the liver than control pigs ; concentrations of lipid peroxidation products  and total and reduced glutathione in the liver did not differ between both groups. clofibrate treated pigs also had higher hepatic mrna concentrations of bax and the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-jun and a lower mrna concentration of bcl-xl than control pigs .


CONCLUSIONS
the data of this study show that clofibrate treatment induces moderate peroxisome proliferation but does not cause oxidative stress in the liver of pigs. gene expression analysis indicates that clofibrate treatment did not inhibit but rather stimulated apoptosis in the liver of these animals. it is also shown that clofibrate increases the expression of the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-jun in the liver, an event which could be critical with respect to carcinogenesis. as the extent of peroxisome proliferation by clofibrate was similar to that observed in humans, the pig can be regarded as a useful model for investigating the effects of peroxisome proliferators on liver function and hepatocarcinogenesis.
