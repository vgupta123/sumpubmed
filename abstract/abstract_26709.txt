BACKGROUND
the moraxella catarrhalis hag protein, an oca autotransporter adhesin, has previously been shown to be important for adherence of this respiratory tract pathogen to human middle ear and a <dig> lung cells.


RESULTS
the present study demonstrates that adherence of m. catarrhalis isogenic hag mutant strains to the human epithelial cell lines chang  and ncih <dig>  is reduced by 50–93%. furthermore, expressing hag in a heterologous escherichia coli background substantially increased the adherence of recombinant bacteria to ncih <dig> cells and murine type iv collagen. hag did not, however, increase the attachment of e. coli to chang cells. these results indicate that hag directly mediates adherence to ncih <dig> lung cells and collagen, but is not sufficient to confer binding to conjunctival monolayers. several in-frame deletions were engineered within the hag gene of m. catarrhalis strain o35e and the resulting proteins were tested for their ability to mediate binding to ncih <dig> monolayers, middle ear cells, and type iv collagen. these experiments revealed that epithelial cell and collagen binding properties are separable, and that residues 385– <dig> of this ~ <dig>  amino acid protein are important for adherence to middle ear and ncih <dig> cells. the region of o35e-hag encompassing aa  <dig> to  <dig> was also found to be required for adherence to collagen. in contrast, β-roll repeats present in hag, which are structural features conserved in several oca adhesins and responsible for the adhesive properties of yersinia enterocolitica yada, are not important for hag-mediated adherence.


CONCLUSIONS
hag is a major adherence factor for human cells derived from various anatomical sites relevant to pathogenesis by m. catarrhalis and its structure-function relationships differ from those of other, closely-related autotransporter proteins.
