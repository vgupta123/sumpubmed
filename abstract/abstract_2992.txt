BACKGROUND
wnt5a and mrfzb <dig> genes are involved in the regulation of tooth size, and their expression levels are similar to that of bmp <dig> during morphogenesis, including during the cap and early bell stages of tooth formation. we previously reported that usag-1-deficient mice form supernumerary maxillary incisors. thus, we hypothesized that bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> signaling molecules may play important roles in tooth morphogenesis. in this study, we established double genetically modified mice to examine the in vivo inter-relationships between bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> 


RESULTS
we measured the volume and cross-sectional areas of the mandibular incisors using micro-computed tomography  in adult bmp7- and usag-1-lacz knock-in mice and their f <dig> generation upon interbreeding. the mandibular incisors of adult bmp7+/− mice were significantly larger than those of wild-type  mice. the mandibular incisors of adult usag-1−/− mice were the largest of all genotypes examined. in the f <dig> generation, the effects of these genes were additive; bmp7+/− was most strongly associated with the increase in tooth size using generalized linear models, and the total area of mandibular supernumerary incisors of usag-1−/−bmp7+/− mice was significantly larger than that of usag-1−/−bmp <dig> +/+ mice. at embryonic day  <dig> , brdu assays demonstrated that the labeling index of bmp7+/− embryos was significantly higher than that of wt embryos in the cervical loop. additionally, the labeling index of usag-1−/− embryos was significantly the highest of all genotypes examined in dental papilla.


CONCLUSIONS
bmp <dig> heterozygous mice exhibited significantly increased tooth sizes, suggesting that tooth size was controlled by specific gene expression. our findings may be useful in applications of regenerative medicine and dentistry.
