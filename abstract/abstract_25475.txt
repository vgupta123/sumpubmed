BACKGROUND
the cloneselectâ„¢ imager system is an image-based visualisation system for cell growth assessment. traditionally cell proliferation is measured with the colorimetric mtt assay.


RESULTS
here we show that both the cloneselect imager and the mtt approach result in comparable ec <dig> values when assaying the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and oxaliplatin on various cell lines. however, the image-based technique was found non-invasive, considerably quicker and more accurate than the mtt assay.


CONCLUSIONS
this new image-based technique has the potential to replace the cumbersome mtt assay when fast, unbiased and high-throughput cytotoxicity assays are requested.
