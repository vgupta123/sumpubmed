BACKGROUND
soybean  is one of the most important oil crops in the world. it is desirable to increase oil yields from soybean, and so this has been a major goal of oilseed engineering. however, it is still uncertain how many genes and which genes are involved in lipid biosynthesis.


RESULTS
here, we evaluated changes in gene expression over the course of seed development using illumina  rna-sequencing. tissues at  <dig> days after flowering  served as the control, and a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were identified at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daf, respectively. gene ontology analyses detected  <dig> co-expressed unigenes associated with lipid biosynthesis. of these,  <dig> showed significant changes in expression levels  during seed development. pathway analysis revealed  <dig> co-expressed transcripts involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. we selected  <dig> differentially expressed genes and analyzed their expressions using qrt-pcr. the results were consistent with those obtained from solexa sequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide a comprehensive molecular biology background for research on soybean seed development, particularly with respect to the process of oil accumulation. all of the genes identified in our research have significance for breeding soybeans with increased oil contents.
