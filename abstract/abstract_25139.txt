BACKGROUND
ion transport proteins generate small electric fields that can induce directional cell motility; however, little is known about their mechanisms that lead to directedness. we investigated na, k-atpase  and na+/h+ exchanger isoforms  in saos- <dig> and calvarial osteoblasts, which present anode- and cathode- directed motility, during electrotaxis.


RESULTS
significant colocalizations of naka with vinculin and pnhe <dig> with ÃŸ-actin were observed to occur at the leading edges of cells. the directedness were attenuated when naka or nhe <dig> was inhibited, confirming their implication in directional sensing. depending on the perceived direction, a divergent regulation in pip <dig> levels as a function of nhe <dig> and naka levels was observed, suggesting that pip <dig> may act as a spatiotemporal regulator of the cell membrane during electrotaxis. moreover, at the same places where pnhe <dig> accumulates, bubble-shaped h+ clouds were observed, suggesting a physio-mechanical role for nhe <dig>  the cell membrane becomes hyperpolarized at the front and depolarized at the back, which confirms naka activity at the leading edge.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest a novel role for both naka and nhe <dig> that extends beyond ion translocation and conclude that they can act as directional sensors and vmem as a regulatory cue which maintain the persistent direction in electrotaxis.
