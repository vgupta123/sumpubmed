BACKGROUND
bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence of neisseria gonorrhoeae revealed the presence of nine probable prophage islands. the distribution, conservation and function of many of these sequences, and their ability to produce bacteriophage particles are unknown.


RESULTS
our analysis of the genomic sequence of fa <dig> identified five genomic regions  that are related to dsdna lysogenic phage. the genetic content of the dsdna prophage sequences were examined in detail and found to contain blocks of genes encoding for proteins homologous to proteins responsible for phage dna replication, structural proteins and proteins responsible for phage assembly. the dna sequences from ngoΦ <dig>  ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> contain some significant regions of identity. a unique region of ngoΦ <dig> showed very high similarity with the pseudomonas aeruginosa generalized transducing phage f <dig>  comparative analysis at the nucleotide and protein levels suggests that the sequences of ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> encode functionally active phages, while ngoΦ <dig>  ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> encode incomplete genomes. expression of the ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> repressors in escherichia coli inhibit the growth of e. coli and the propagation of phage λ. the ngoΦ <dig> repressor was able to inhibit transcription of n. gonorrhoeae genes and haemophilus influenzae hp <dig> phage promoters. the holin gene of ngoΦ <dig> , when expressed in e. coli, could serve as substitute for the phage λ s gene. we were able to detect the presence of the dna derived from ngoΦ <dig> in the cultures of n. gonorrhoeae. electron microscopy analysis of culture supernatants revealed the presence of multiple forms of bacteriophage particles.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that the genes similar to dsdna lysogenic phage present in the gonococcus are generally conserved in this pathogen and that they are able to regulate the expression of other neisserial genes. since phage particles were only present in culture supernatants after induction with mitomycin c, it indicates that the gonococcus also regulates the expression of bacteriophage genes.
