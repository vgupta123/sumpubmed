BACKGROUND
reference transcriptomes provide valuable resources for understanding evolution within and among species. we de novo assembled and annotated a reference transcriptome for quercus lobata and q. garryana and identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms  to provide resources for forest genomicists studying this ecologically and economically important genus. we further performed preliminary analyses of genes important in interspecific divergent  selection that might explain ecological differences among species, estimating rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  and fay and wu’s h. functional classes of genes were tested for unusually high dn/ds or low h consistent with divergent positive selection.


RESULTS
our draft transcriptome is among the most complete for oaks, including  <dig>  contigs ,  <dig>  complete and  <dig>  partial gene models, and functional annotations for  <dig>  arabidopsis orthologs and  <dig>  contigs with pfam hits. we identified  <dig>  million possible sequence variants including  <dig>  million high-quality diallelic snps — among the largest sets identified in any tree.  <dig> of  <dig> functional categories with significantly elevated dn/ds are involved in disease response, including 50+ genes with dn/ds >  <dig>  other high-dn/ds genes are involved in biotic response, flowering and growth, or regulatory processes. in contrast, median dn/ds was low , suggesting that purifying selection influences most genes. no functional categories have unusually low h.


CONCLUSIONS
these results offer preliminary support for the hypothesis that divergent selection at pathogen resistance are important factors in species divergence in these hybridizing california oaks. our transcriptome provides a solid foundation for future studies of gene expression, natural selection, and speciation in quercus.
