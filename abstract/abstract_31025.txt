BACKGROUND
rna polymerase ii  is essential in gene transcription and chip-seq experiments have been used to study polii binding patterns over the entire genome. however, since polii enriched regions in the genome can be very long, existing peak finding algorithms for chip-seq data are not adequate for identifying such long regions.

methods
here we propose an enriched region detection method for chip-seq data to identify long enriched regions by combining a signal denoising algorithm with a false discovery rate  approach. the binned chip-seq data for polii are first processed using a non-local means  algorithm for purposes of denoising. then, a fdr approach is developed to determine the threshold for marking enriched regions in the binned histogram.


RESULTS
we first test our method using a public polii chip-seq dataset and compare our results with published results obtained using the published algorithm hpeak. our results show a high consistency with the published results . then, we apply our proposed method on polii chip-seq data generated in our own study on the effects of hormone on the breast cancer cell line mcf <dig>  the results demonstrate that our method can effectively identify long enriched regions in chip-seq datasets. specifically, pertaining to mcf <dig> control samples we identified  <dig>  segments with length of at least  <dig> kbp ; and in mcf <dig> treated with e <dig> samples, we identified  <dig>  such segments .


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in studying binding patterns of polii in cancer cells which enables further deep analysis in transcription regulation and epigenetics. our method complements existing peak detection algorithms for chip-seq experiments.
