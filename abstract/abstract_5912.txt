BACKGROUND
urease, one of the highly efficient known enzymes, catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. the present study aimed to extract urease from pea seeds . the enzyme was then purified in three consequence steps: acetone precipitation, deae-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography .


RESULTS
the purification fold was  <dig>  with a yield of 40%. the molecular weight of the isolated urease was estimated by chromatography to be  <dig>  daltons. maximum urease activity  was achieved at the optimum conditions of 40°c and ph of  <dig>  after 5 min of incubation. the kinetic parameters, k
m
 and v
max
, were estimated by lineweaver-burk fits and found to be 500 mm and  <dig>  u/g, respectively. the thermodynamic constants of activation, Δh, e
a
, and Δs, were determined using arrhenius plot and found to be  <dig>  kj/mol,  <dig>  kj/mol, and  <dig>  kj/mol/k, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
urease was purified from germinating pisum sativum l. seeds. the purification fold, yield, and molecular weight were determined. the effects of ph, concentration of enzyme, temperature, concentration of substrate, and storage period on urease activity were examined. this may provide an insight on the various aspects of the property of the enzyme. the significance of extracting urease from different sources could play a good role in understanding the metabolism of urea in plants.
