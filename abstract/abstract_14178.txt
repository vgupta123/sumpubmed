BACKGROUND
the present study was carried out to determine whether the p <dig> pathway played a role in the spontaneous immortalization of the sc- <dig> chicken embryo fibroblast  cell line that has been in continuous culture for over three years.


RESULTS
the sc- <dig> cell line emerged from an extended crisis period with a considerably slower growth rate than primary cef cells. the phenotype of the sc- <dig> cells changed dramatically at about passage  <dig>  appearing smaller than at earlier passages  and possessing a small, compact morphology. this morphological change coincided with an increase in growth rate. passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells expressed undetectable levels of p <dig> mrna, but by passage  <dig>  the levels were elevated compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells and similar to levels in senescent cef cells. however, the high level of p <dig> mrna detected in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells did not correlate to functional protein activity. the expression levels of the p53-regulated p21waf <dig> gene were significantly decreased in all sc- <dig> passages that were analyzed. examination of the rb pathway revealed that e2f- <dig> and p15ink4b expression fluctuated with increasing passages, with levels higher in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study suggests that altered expression of genes involved in the p <dig> and rb pathways, specifically, p <dig> and p21waf <dig>  may have contributed to the immortalization of the sc- <dig> cef cell line.
