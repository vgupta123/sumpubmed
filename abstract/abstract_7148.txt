BACKGROUND
crohn's disease  is a high morbidity chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology. adherent-invasive escherichia coli  has been recently implicated in the origin and perpetuation of cd. because bacterial biofilms in the gut mucosa are suspected to play a role in cd and biofilm formation is a feature of certain pathogenic e. coli strains, we compared the biofilm formation capacity of  <dig> aiec and  <dig> non-aiec strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa. biofilm formation capacity was then contrasted with the aiec phenotype, the serotype, the phylotype, and the presence of virulence genes.


RESULTS
specific biofilm formation  indices were higher amongst aiec than non-aiec strains . in addition,  <dig> % of moderate to strong biofilms producers were aiec, whereas  <dig> % of weak biofilm producers were non-aiec . these data indicate that aiec strains were more efficient biofilm producers than non-aiec strains. moreover, adhesion  and invasion  indices correlated positively with higher sbf indices. additionally, motility , h <dig> type flagellin , serogroups o <dig>  and o <dig> , the presence of virulence genes such as sfa/focde  and ibea , and b <dig> phylotype  were frequent characteristics amongst biofilm producers.


CONCLUSIONS
the principal contribution of the present work is the finding that biofilm formation capacity is a novel, complementary pathogenic feature of the recently described aiec pathovar. characterization of aiec specific genetic determinants, and the regulatory pathways, involved in biofilm formation will likely bring new insights into aiec pathogenesis.
