BACKGROUND
previous studies have shown that testosterone enhances baroreflex bradycardia. therefore, conscious unrestrained rats were used to investigate the role of the androgen receptor in the testosterone-mediated modulation of baroreflex bradycardia. androgen depletion , and androgen receptor blockade , were implemented to test the hypothesis that testosterone influences baroreflex bradycardia via its activity at the androgen receptor in male rats. phenylephrine  was used to assess baroreflex bradycardia.


RESULTS
androgen depletion attenuated baroreflex bradycardia . the antiandrogen flutamide  caused dose-related attenuation of baroreflex bradycardia in spite of a significant  increase in serum testosterone. the latter did not lead to increased serum 17β-estradiol level.


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest: 1) androgen depletion or adequate androgen receptor blockade attenuates baroreflex bradycardia. 2) the reflex increase in serum testosterone may counterbalance the action of the lower doses  of flutamide. 3) the absence of a change in serum 17β-estradiol rules out its contribution to flutamide action on baroreflex bradycardia.
