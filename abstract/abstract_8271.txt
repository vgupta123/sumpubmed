BACKGROUND
the leukocyte common antigen related receptor  protein has been shown to modulate the signal transduction of a number of different growth factors, including insulin and insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  splice variants exhibit differing roles and are expressed according to tissue type and developmental stage.


RESULTS
using 5'race, we identified a 5'utr within intron  <dig> of the rat lar gene. we demonstrated that this gives rise to a novel isoform of the lar transcript encoded from the identified region within intron  <dig>  by priming across the site from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> we show that the novel 5'utr is not represented in the full-length transcript and thus, it produces a truncated form of the lar mrna. we examined the tissue distribution of this novel isoform and found it to be exclusively expressed in liver. we additionally identified a liver specific  <dig> kda band with western blotting which we propose may represent the protein product of the novel transcript. luciferase assays showed the region immediately upstream of the 5'utr to possesses considerable promoter activity and that this may be conferred by the presence of a number of putative binding sites for liver enriched transcription factors.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we describe a novel, liver specific, truncated isoform of the lar transcript transcribed under the control of an intronic promoter, potentially representing a previously unidentified modulator of hepatic insulin signalling.
