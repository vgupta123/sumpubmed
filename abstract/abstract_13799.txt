BACKGROUND
overexpression of the cut homeobox  <dig> gene, cux <dig>  inversely
correlates with patient survival in breast cancers. cell-based assays and
molecular studies have revealed that transcriptional regulation by
cux <dig> involves mostly the proteolytically processed p110
isoform. as there is no antibody specific to p <dig> cux <dig> only, an alternate
strategy must be employed to identify its targets.


RESULTS
we expressed physiological levels of a tagged-p <dig> cux <dig> protein and performed
chromatin affinity purification followed by hybridization on encode and
promoter arrays. targets were validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and
transcriptional regulation by cux <dig> was analyzed in expression profiling and
rt-qpcr assays following cux <dig> knockdown or p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression.
approximately 47% and 14% of cux <dig> binding sites were respectively mapped
less than  <dig> kbp, or more than  <dig> kbp, away from a transcription start site.
more genes exhibited changes in expression following cux <dig> knockdown than
p <dig> cux <dig> overexpression. cux <dig> directly activated or repressed  <dig> % and  <dig> %
of putative targets identified on the encode and promoter arrays
respectively. this proportion increased to  <dig> % for targets with  <dig> binding
sites or more. transcriptional repression was observed in a slightly higher
proportion of target genes. the cux <dig> consensus binding motif, atcrat, was
found at  <dig> % of the cux <dig> binding sites, yet only  <dig> % of the cux1
consensus motifs present on the array were bound in vivo. the
presence of a consensus binding motif did not have an impact on whether a
target gene was repressed or activated. interestingly, the distance between
a binding site and a transcription start site did not significantly reduced
the ability of cux <dig> to regulate a target gene. moreover, cux <dig> not only was
able to regulate the next adjacent gene, but also regulated the gene located
beyond this one as well as the gene located further away in the opposite
direction.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that p <dig> cux <dig> can activate or repress transcription
when bound at a distance and can regulate more than one gene on certain
genomic loci.
