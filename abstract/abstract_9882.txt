BACKGROUND
the distributed annotation system  is a network protocol for exchanging biological data. it is frequently used to share annotations of genomes and protein sequence.


RESULTS
here we present several extensions to the current das  <dig>  protocol. these provide new commands to share alignments, three dimensional molecular structure data, add the possibility for registration and discovery of das servers, and provide a convention how to provide different types of data plots. we present examples of web sites and applications that use the new extensions. we operate a public registry of das sources, which now includes entries for more than  <dig> distinct sources.


CONCLUSIONS
our das extensions are essential for the management of the growing number of services and exchange of diverse biological data sets. in addition the extensions allow new types of applications to be developed and scientific questions to be addressed. the registry of das sources is available at
