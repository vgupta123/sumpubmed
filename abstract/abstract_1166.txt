BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen and is extremely difficult to treat due to its high intrinsic and adaptive antibiotic resistance, ability to form biofilms in chronic infections and broad arsenal of virulence factors, which are finely regulated. typa is a gtpase that has recently been identified to modulate virulence in enteric gram-negative pathogens.


RESULTS
here, we demonstrate that mutation of typa in p. aeruginosa resulted in reduced virulence in phagocytic amoebae and human macrophage models of infection. in addition, the typa mutant was attenuated in rapid cell attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation, and exhibited reduced antibiotic resistance to ÃŸ-lactam, tetracycline and antimicrobial peptide antibiotics. quantitative rt-pcr revealed the down-regulation, in a typa mutant, of important virulence-related genes such as those involved in regulation and assembly of the type iii secretion system, consistent with the observed phenotypes and role in virulence of p. aeruginosa.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that typa is a newly identified modulator of pathogenesis in p. aeruginosa and is involved in multiple virulence-related characteristics.
