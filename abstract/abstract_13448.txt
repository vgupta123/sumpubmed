BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  are classified into typical and atypical strains based on the presence of the e. coli adherence factor  plasmid. the eaf plasmid contains the bfp  operon and the perabc  gene cluster. a 1-kb cryptic region of eaf plasmid has been widely used as a genetic probe for epec detection. however, some epec strains may harbor an eaf plasmid lacking the eaf probe sequence, which makes the differentiation between typical and atypical a complex task. in this study, we report the genetic analysis of the eaf plasmid-encoded genes in a collection of epec clinical isolates.

methods
a total of  <dig> epec clinical isolates, which were previously classified as typical  or atypical  by eaf probe reactivity, were screened for the presence of different eaf sequences by pcr and dna hybridization.


RESULTS
all typical strains possessed intact bfpa and pera genes, and most of them were positive in the pcr for eaf probe sequence. however, a subset of  <dig> typical strains,  <dig> of which belonged to o <dig> serogroup, presented a  <dig> pb deletion in the region between 1093-bp downstream perc and 616-bp of the eaf fragment. the bfpa, bfpg, and per genes were found in all typical strains. in addition,  <dig>  atypical strains presented the pera gene, and  <dig>  also presented the bfpa gene. among the  <dig> strains,  <dig> belonged to the o119:h <dig>  o119:hnd, and ont:hnd serotypes. all  <dig> atypical strains contained pera mutation frameshifts and possessed an is <dig> element upstream of the per operon as detected by pcr followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism  typing and multiplex pcr. among the  <dig> bfpa probe-positive strains, eight o <dig> strains possessed deletion in the bfp operon at the 3′end of bfpa due to an is <dig> element.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that typical o <dig> strains may contain a deletion within the eaf probe sequence not previously reported. this new finding suggests that care should be taken when using the previously described eaf pcr assay in epidemiological studies for the detection of typical o <dig> strains. in addition, we were able to confirm that some atypical strains carry vestiges of the eaf plasmid.
