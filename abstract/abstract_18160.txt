BACKGROUND
pseudogenes are an integral component of the human genome. little attention, however, has so far been paid to the phenomenon that some pseudogenes are transcriptionally active. recently, we demonstrated that the human ortholog of the rodent testis-specific atp-binding cassette  transporter abca <dig> is a ubiquitously transcribed pseudogene . the aim of the present study was to establish a complete inventory of all abc transporter pseudogenes in the human genome and to identify transcriptionally active abc transporter pseudogenes. moreover, we tested the hypothesis that a regulatory interdependency exists between abc transporter pseudogenes and their parental protein coding equivalents.


RESULTS
systematic bioinformatic analysis revealed the existence of  <dig> abc transporter pseudogenes within the human genome. we identified two clusters on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, which harbor almost half of all pseudogenes . available information from est and mrna databases and rt-pcr expression profiling indicate that a large portion of the abc transporter pseudogenes  are transcriptionally active and some of them are expressed as alternative splice variants. we demonstrate that both pseudogenes of the pseudoxanthoma elasticum gene abcc <dig>  abcc6p <dig> and abcc6p <dig>  are transcribed. abcc6p <dig> and abcc <dig> possess near-identical promoter sequences and their tissue-specific expression profiles are strikingly similar raising the possibility that they form a gene-pseudogene dual transcription unit. intriguingly, targeted knockdown of the transcribed pseudogene abcc6p <dig> resulted in a significant reduction of abcc <dig> mrna expression levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the human genome contains a surprisingly small number of abc transporter pseudogenes relative to other known gene families. they are unevenly distributed across the chromosomes. importantly, a significant portion of the abc transporter pseudogenes is transcriptionally active. the downregulation of abcc <dig> mrna levels by targeted suppression of the expression of its pseudogene abcc6p <dig> provides evidence, for the first time, for a regulatory interdependence of a transcribed pseudogene and its protein coding counterpart in the human genome.
