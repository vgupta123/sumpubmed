BACKGROUND
sensing and responding to environmental changes is a central aspect of cell division regulation. mycobacterium tuberculosis contains eleven ser/thr kinases, two of which, pkna and pknb, are key signaling molecules that regulate cell division/morphology. one substrate of these kinases is wag <dig>  and we previously showed that partial depletion of wag <dig> caused morphological changes indicative of cell wall defects, and that the phosphorylation state of wag <dig> affected cell growth in mycobacteria. in the present study, we further characterized the role of the wag <dig> phosphorylation in polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that the differential growth among cells expressing different wag <dig> alleles  is caused by, at least in part, dissimilar nascent peptidoglycan biosynthesis. the phosphorylation state of wag <dig> is found to be important for protein-protein interactions between the wag <dig> molecules, and thus, for its polar localization. consistent with these results, cells expressing a phosphomimetic wag <dig> allele have a higher enzymatic activity in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
the wag31mtb phosphorylation is a novel molecular mechanism by which wag31mtb regulates peptidoglycan synthesis and thus, optimal growth in mycobacteria.
