BACKGROUND
our current understanding of transcription factor binding sites  in sequenced prokaryotic genomes is very limited due to the lack of an accurate and efficient computational method for the prediction of tfbss at a genome scale. in an attempt to change this situation, we have recently developed a comparative genomics based algorithm called gleclubs for de novo genome-wide prediction of tfbss in a target genome. although gleclubs has achieved rather high prediction accuracy of tfbss in a target genome, it is still not efficient enough to be applied to all the sequenced prokaryotic genomes.


RESULTS
here, we designed a new algorithm based on gleclubs called extended gleclubs  for simultaneous prediction of tfbss in a group of related prokaryotic genomes. when tested on a group of Î³-proteobacterial genomes including e. coli k <dig>  a group of firmicutes genomes including b. subtilis and a group of cyanobacterial genomes using the same parameter settings, egleclubs predicts more than 82% of known tfbss in extracted inter-operonic sequences in both e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis. because each genome in a group is equally treated, it is highly likely that similar prediction accuracy has been achieved for each genome in the group.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new algorithm for genome-wide de novo prediction of tfbss in a group of related prokaryotic genomes. the algorithm has achieved the same level of accuracy and robustness as its predecessor gleclubs, but can work on dozens of genomes at the same time.
