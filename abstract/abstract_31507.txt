BACKGROUND
discovery of new bioactive molecules that could enter drug discovery programs or that could serve as chemical probes is a very complex and costly endeavor. structure-based and ligand-based in silico screening approaches are nowadays extensively used to complement experimental screening approaches in order to increase the effectiveness of the process and facilitating the screening of thousands or millions of small molecules against a biomolecular target. both in silico screening methods require as input a suitable chemical compound collection and most often the 3d structure of the small molecules has to be generated since compounds are usually delivered in 1d smiles, cansmiles or in 2d sdf formats.


RESULTS
here, we describe the new open source program dg-ammos which allows the generation of the 3d conformation of small molecules using distance geometry and their energy minimization via automated molecular mechanics optimization. the program is validated on the astex dataset, the chembridge diversity database and on a number of small molecules with known crystal structures extracted from the cambridge structural database. a comparison with the free program balloon and the well-known commercial program omega generating the 3d of small molecules is carried out. the results show that the new free program dg-ammos is a very efficient 3d structure generator engine.


CONCLUSIONS
dg-ammos provides fast, automated and reliable access to the generation of 3d conformation of small molecules and facilitates the preparation of a compound collection prior to high-throughput virtual screening computations. the validation of dg-ammos on several different datasets proves that generated structures are generally of equal quality or sometimes better than structures obtained by other tested methods.
