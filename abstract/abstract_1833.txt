BACKGROUND
protein structure prediction is an important but unsolved problem in biological science. predicted structures vary much with energy functions and structure-mapping spaces. in our simplified ab initio protein structure prediction methods, we use hydrophobic-polar  energy model for structure evaluation, and 3-dimensional face-centred-cubic lattice for structure mapping. for hp energy model, developing a compact hydrophobic-core  is essential for the progress of the search. the h-core helps find a stable structure with the lowest possible free energy.


RESULTS
in order to build h-cores, we present a new spiral search algorithm based on tabu-guided local search. our algorithm uses a novel h-core directed guidance heuristic that squeezes the structure around a dynamic hydrophobic-core centre. we applied random walks to break premature h-cores and thus to avoid early convergence. we also used a novel relay-restart technique to handle stagnation.


CONCLUSIONS
we have tested our algorithms on a set of benchmark protein sequences. the experimental results show that our spiral search algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art local search algorithms for simplified protein structure prediction. we also experimentally show the effectiveness of the relay-restart.
