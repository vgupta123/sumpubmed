BACKGROUND
comprehensive sequence characterization across the mhc is important for successful organ transplantation and genetic association studies. to this end, we have developed an automated sample preparation, molecular barcoding and multiplexing protocol for the amplification and sequence-determination of class i hla loci. we have coupled this process to a novel hla calling algorithm to determine the most likely pair of alleles at each locus.


RESULTS
we have benchmarked our protocol with  <dig> hapmap individuals from four worldwide populations with  <dig> % accuracy at 4-digit resolution. a variation of this initial protocol, more suitable for large sample sizes, in which molecular barcodes are added during pcr rather than library construction, was tested on  <dig> hapmap individuals with  <dig> % accuracy at 4-digit resolution.


CONCLUSIONS
next-generation sequencing on the  <dig> flx titanium platform is a reliable, efficient, and scalable technology for hla typing.
