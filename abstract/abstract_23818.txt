BACKGROUND
the role of the endothelial cell  in blood flow regulation within the central nervous system has been little studied. here, we explored ec participation in morphological changes of the anterior hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus  microvasculature of female rats at two reproductive stages with different metabolic demand . we measured the inner capillary diameter  of  <dig> capillaries from either the magnocellular or parvocellular regions. the space occupied by neural  and glial, but excluding vascular elements of the neurovascular compartment was also measured in 100-Î¼m <dig> sample fields of both pvn subdivisions.


RESULTS
the pvn of both groups of animals showed icds that ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> microns. the virgin group presented mostly capillaries with small icd, whereas the lactating females exhibited a significant increment in the percentage of capillaries with larger icd. the space occupied by the neural and glial elements of the neurovascular compartment did not show changes with lactation.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that during lactation the microvasculature of the pvn of female rats undergoes dynamic, transitory changes in blood flow as represented by an increment in the icd through a self-cytoplasmic volume modification reflected by ec changes. a model of this process is proposed.
