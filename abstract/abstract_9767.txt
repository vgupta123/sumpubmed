BACKGROUND
high-throughput screens have revealed large-scale protein interaction networks defining most cellular functions. how the proteins were added to the protein interaction network during its growth is a basic and important issue. network motifs represent the simplest building blocks of cellular machines and are of biological significance.


RESULTS
here we study the evolution of protein interaction networks from the perspective of network motifs. we find that in current protein interaction networks, proteins of the same age class tend to form motifs and such co-origins of motif constituents are affected by their topologies and biological functions. further, we find that the proteins within motifs whose constituents are of the same age class tend to be densely interconnected, co-evolve and share the same biological functions, and these motifs tend to be within protein complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide novel evidence for the hypothesis of the additions of clustered interacting nodes and point out network motifs, especially the motifs with the dense topology and specific function may play important roles during this process. our results suggest functional constraints may be the underlying driving force for such additions of clustered interacting nodes.
