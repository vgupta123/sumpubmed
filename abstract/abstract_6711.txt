BACKGROUND
the c. elegans sperm protein spe- <dig>  a membrane protein of unknown structure and molecular function, is required for fertilization. sperm from worms with spe- <dig> mutations appear normal but are unable to fertilize eggs. sequence analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> conserved cysteine residues in the c-terminal cytoplasmic domain of this protein suggesting these residues form a zinc-coordinating ring finger structure.


RESULTS
we made an in silico structural model of the spe- <dig> ring finger domain based on primary sequence analysis and previously reported ring structures. to test the model, we created spe- <dig> transgenes coding for mutations in each of the  <dig> cysteine residues predicted to coordinate zn++ ions in the ring finger motif. transgenes were crossed into a spe- <dig> null background and protein function was measured by counting progeny. we found that all  <dig> cysteines are required for protein function. we also showed that sequence differences between the c-terminal  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in c. elegans and c. briggsae spe- <dig> following the ring finger domain are not responsible for the failure of the c. briggsae spe- <dig> homolog to rescue c. elegans spe- <dig> mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that a bona fide ring domain is present at the c-terminus of the spe- <dig> protein and that this motif is required for sperm-egg interactions during c. elegans fertilization. our structural model of the ring domain provides a starting point for further structure-function analysis of this critical region of the protein. the c-terminal domain swap experiment suggests that the incompatibility between the c. elegans and c. briggsae spe- <dig> proteins is caused by small amino acid differences outside the c-terminal domain.
