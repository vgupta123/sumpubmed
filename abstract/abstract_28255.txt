BACKGROUND
ocimum americanum var. pilosum is a chilling-sensitive, widely distributed plant that is consumed as a vegetable in central and southern china. to increase our understanding of cold stress responses in this species, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly for o. americanum var. pilosum and compared the transcriptomes of plants grown under normal and low temperatures.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> , <dig> high quality, clean reads were obtained from four libraries  and were used to perform de novo transcriptome assembly. after isoforms were considered,  <dig>  unigenes were generated,  <dig>  of which were similar to known proteins as determined by a blastx search  against ncbi non-redundant, swiss-prot, gene ontology, kegg, and cluster of cog databases. comparative analysis of transcriptomes revealed that  <dig> unigenes were differentially expressed  in chilling-treated samples, and that  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were up- and down-regulated by chilling stress, respectively. expression of the  <dig> most up-regulated and the five most down-regulated unigenes was validated by qrt-pcr. to increase our understanding of these differentially expressed unigenes, we performed gene ontology and kegg pathway enrichment analyses. the cbf-mediated transcriptional cascade, a well-known cold tolerance pathway, was reconstructed using our de novo assembled transcriptome.


CONCLUSIONS
our study has generated a genome-wide transcript profile of o. americanum var. pilosum and a de novo assembled transcriptome, which can be used to characterize genes related to diverse biological processes. this is the first study to assess the cold-responsive transcriptome in an ocimum species. our results suggest that cold temperature significantly affects genes related to protein translation and cellular metabolism in this chilling sensitive species. although most of the cbf pathway genes have orthologs in o. americanum var. pilosum, none of the identified cold responsive  gene orthologs was induced by cold, which is consistent with the lack of cold tolerance in this plant.
