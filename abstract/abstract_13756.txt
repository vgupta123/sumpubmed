BACKGROUND
traditional gene annotation methods rely on characteristics that may not be available in short reads generated from next generation technology, resulting in suboptimal performance for metagenomic  samples. therefore, in recent years, new programs have been developed that optimize performance on short reads. in this work, we benchmark three metagenomic gene prediction programs and combine their predictions to improve metagenomic read gene annotation.


RESULTS
we not only analyze the programs' performance at different read-lengths like similar studies, but also separate different types of reads, including intra- and intergenic regions, for analysis. the main deficiencies are in the algorithms' ability to predict non-coding regions and gene edges, resulting in more false-positives and false-negatives than desired. in fact, the specificities of the algorithms are notably worse than the sensitivities. by combining the programs' predictions, we show significant improvement in specificity at minimal cost to sensitivity, resulting in 4% improvement in accuracy for  <dig> bp reads with ~1% improvement in accuracy for  <dig> bp reads and above. to correctly annotate the start and stop of the genes, we find that a consensus of all the predictors performs best for shorter read lengths while a unanimous agreement is better for longer read lengths, boosting annotation accuracy by 1-8%. we also demonstrate use of the classifier combinations on a real dataset.


CONCLUSIONS
to optimize the performance for both prediction and annotation accuracies, we conclude that the consensus of all methods  is the best for reads  <dig> bp and shorter, while using the intersection of genemark and orphelia predictions is the best for reads  <dig> bp and longer. we demonstrate that most methods predict over 80% coding  reads on a real human gut sample sequenced by illumina technology.
