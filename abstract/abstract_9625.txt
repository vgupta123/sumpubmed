BACKGROUND
sporothrix schenckii is a pathogenic, dimorphic fungus, the etiological agent of sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous lymphatic mycosis. dimorphism in s. schenckii responds to second messengers such as camp and calcium, suggesting the possible involvement of a calcium/calmodulin kinase in its regulation. in this study we describe a novel calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in s. schenckii, sscmk <dig>  and the effects of inhibitors of calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin kinases on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle.


RESULTS
using the pcr homology approach a new member of the calcium/calmodulin kinase family, sscmk <dig>  was identified in this fungus. the cdna sequence of sscmk <dig> revealed an open reading frame of  <dig>  nucleotides encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the genomic sequence of sscmk <dig> revealed the same orf interrupted by five introns. bioinformatic analyses of sscmk <dig> showed that this protein had the distinctive features that characterize a calcium/calmodulin protein kinase: a serine/threonine protein kinase domain and a calmodulin-binding domain. when compared to homologues from seven species of filamentous fungi, sscmk <dig> showed substantial similarities, except for a large and highly variable region that encompasses positions  <dig> â€“  <dig> of the multiple sequence alignment. inhibition studies using calmodulin inhibitor w- <dig>  and calcium/calmodulin kinase inhibitors, kn- <dig> and lavendustin c, were found to inhibit budding by cells induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle and to favor the yeast to mycelium transition.


CONCLUSIONS
this study constitutes the first evidence of the presence of a calcium/calmodulin kinase-encoding gene in s. schenckii and its possible involvement as an effector of dimorphism in this fungus. these results suggest that a calcium/calmodulin dependent signaling pathway could be involved in the regulation of dimorphism in this fungus. the results suggest that the calcium/calmodulin kinases of yeasts are evolutionarily distinct from those in filamentous fungi.
