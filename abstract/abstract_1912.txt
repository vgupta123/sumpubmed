BACKGROUND
most of the natural variation in flowering time in arabidopsis thaliana can be attributed to allelic variation at the gene frigida , which activates expression of the floral repressor flowering locus c . usually, late-flowering accessions carry functional fri alleles , whereas early flowering accessions contain non-functional alleles. the two most frequent alleles found in early flowering accessions are the ones present in the commonly used lab strains columbia  and landsberg erecta , which contain a premature stop codon and a deletion of the start codon respectively.


RESULTS
analysis of flowering time data from various arabidopsis natural accessions indicated that the fri-ler allele retains some functionality. we generated transgenic lines carrying the fri-col or fri-ler allele in order to compare their effect on flowering time, vernalization response and flc expression in the same genetic background. we characterize their modes of regulation through allele-specific expression and their relevance in nature through re-analysis of published datasets. we demonstrate that the fri-ler allele induces flc expression, delays flowering time and confers sensitivity to vernalization in contrast to the true null fri-col allele. nevertheless, the fri-ler allele revealed a weaker effect when compared to the fully functional fri-wt allele, mainly due to reduced expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study defines for the first time the existence of a new class of arabidopsis accessions with an intermediate phenotype between slow and rapid cycling types. although using available data from a common garden experiment we cannot observe fitness differences between accessions carrying the fri-ler or the fri-col allele, the phenotypic changes observed in the lab suggest that variation in these alleles could play a role in adaptation to specific natural environments.
