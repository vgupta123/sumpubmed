BACKGROUND
we investigated the use of a new mmp activatable probe mmpsense™  <dig> fast  for in-vivo visualization of early mmp activity in ischemic stroke. following middle cerebral artery occlusion  optical imaging was performed. near-infrared  fluorescent images of mmpsense activation were acquired using an olympus fluorescent microscope,  <dig> x objective, a ccd camera and an appropriate filter cube for detecting the activated probe with peak excitation and emission at  <dig> and 775 nm, respectively. images were acquired starting at  <dig> or  <dig> hours after reperfusion over the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex before and for  <dig> hours after, mmpsense <dig> was injected.


RESULTS
increased intensities ipsilaterally were observed following mmpsense <dig> injection with ischemic injury but not in sham animals. there were significant ipsilateral and contralateral differences at  <dig> minutes  in early ischemic reperfusion and at time  <dig> in  <dig> hours post ischemia  which persisted at  <dig> minutes in both these groups , but not following sham surgery. the increase in ipsilateral signal intensity was attenuated by hypothermia. these observations corresponded with a significant increase in the total mmp- <dig> protein levels,  <dig> and  <dig> hours following ischemia reperfusion  and their reduction by hypothermia.


CONCLUSIONS
matrix-metalloproteinase upregulation in ischemia reperfusion can be imaged acutely in-vivo with nirf using mmpsense <dig>  hypothermia attenuated both the optical increase in intensity after mmpsense <dig> and the increase in mmp- <dig> protein expression supporting the proof of concept that nirf imaging using mmpsense can be used to assess potential therapeutic strategies for stroke treatment.
