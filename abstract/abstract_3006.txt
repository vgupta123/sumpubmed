BACKGROUND
cowpea  exhibits a considerable variation in leaf shape. although cowpea is mostly utilized as a dry grain and animal fodder crop, cowpea leaves are also used as a high-protein pot herb in many countries of africa.


RESULTS
leaf morphology was studied in the cowpea ril population, sanzi  x vita  <dig> . a qtl for leaf shape, hls , was identified on the sanzi x vita  <dig> genetic map spanning from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm distance on linkage group  <dig>  snp marker 1_ <dig> was the most significant over the two experiments, accounting for  <dig> % phenotypic variance  in a greenhouse experiment and  <dig> % phenotypic variance  in a field experiment. the corresponding hls locus was positioned on the cowpea consensus genetic map on linkage group  <dig>  spanning from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. a marker-trait association of the hls region identified snp marker 1_ <dig> alleles co-segregating with either the hastate or sub-globose leaf phenotype. high co-linearity was observed for the syntenic hls region in medicago truncatula and glycine max. one syntenic locus for hls was identified on medicago chromosome  <dig> while syntenic regions for hls were identified on two soybean chromosomes,  <dig> and  <dig>  in all three syntenic loci, an ortholog for the eza1/swinger  gene was observed and is the candidate gene for the hls locus. the hls locus was identified on the cowpea physical map via snp markers 1_ <dig>  1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> which were identified in three bac contigs; contig <dig>  contig <dig> and contig <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated how integrated genomic resources can be utilized for a candidate gene approach. identification of genes which control leaf morphology may be utilized to improve the quality of cowpea leaves for vegetable and or forage markets as well as contribute to more fundamental research understanding the control of leaf shape in legumes.
