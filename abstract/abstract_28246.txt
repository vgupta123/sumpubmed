BACKGROUND
starvation triggers a complex array of adaptative metabolic responses including energy-metabolic responses, a process which must imply tissue specific alterations in gene expression and in which the liver plays a central role. the present study aimed to describe the evolution of global gene expression profiles in liver of 4-week-old male chickens during a  <dig> h fasting period using a chicken  <dig> k oligoarray.


RESULTS
a large number of genes were modulated by fasting ;  <dig> showed an amplitude of variation higher than +/- 40% among those,  <dig> presented an human ortholog, allowing to collect functional information. notably more genes were down-regulated than up-regulated, whatever the duration of fasting . the number of genes differentially expressed after  <dig> h of fasting was  <dig> -fold higher than after  <dig> h of fasting. four clusters of co-expressed genes were identified by a hierarchical cluster analysis. gene ontology, kegg and ingenuity databases were then used to identify the metabolic processes associated to each cluster. after  <dig> h of fasting, genes involved in ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial or peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, were up-regulated  whereas genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis were down-regulated . for all genes tested, the microarray data was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr. most genes were altered by fasting as already reported in mammals. a notable exception was the hmg-coa synthase  <dig> gene, which was up-regulated following  <dig> and  <dig> h of fasting while the other genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were down-regulated as reported in mammalian studies. we further focused on genes not represented on the microarray and candidates for the regulation of the target genes belonging to cluster- <dig> and - <dig> and involved in lipid metabolism. data are provided concerning ppara, srebp <dig>  srebp <dig>  nr1h <dig> transcription factors and two desaturases .


CONCLUSIONS
this study evidences numerous genes altered by starvation in chickens and suggests a global repression of cellular activity in response to this stressor. the central role of lipid and acetyl-coa metabolisms and its regulation at transcriptional level are confirmed in chicken liver in response to short-term fasting. interesting expression modulations were observed for nr1h <dig>  fads <dig> and fads <dig> genes. further studies are needed to precise their role in the complex regulatory network controlling lipid metabolism.
