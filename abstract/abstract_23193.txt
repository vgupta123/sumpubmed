BACKGROUND
computational methods for structural gene annotation have propelled gene discovery but face certain drawbacks with regards to prokaryotic genome annotation. identification of transcriptional start sites, demarcating overlapping gene boundaries, and identifying regulatory elements such as small rna are not accurate using these approaches. in this study, we re-visit the structural annotation of mannheimia haemolytica phl <dig>  a bovine respiratory disease pathogen. m. haemolytica is one of the causative agents of bovine respiratory disease that results in about $ <dig> billion annual losses to the cattle industry. we used rna-seq and analyzed the data using freely-available computational methods and resources. the aim was to identify previously unannotated regions of the genome using rna-seq based expression profile to complement the existing annotation of this pathogen.


RESULTS
using the illumina genome analyzer, we generated  <dig> , <dig> reads  and aligned them to the reference genome using bowtie. the transcribed regions were analyzed using samtools and custom perl scripts in conjunction with blast searches and available gene annotation information. the single nucleotide resolution map enabled the identification of  <dig> novel protein coding regions as well as  <dig> potential novel srna. the basal transcription profile revealed that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  annotated regions were expressed in vitro, at  <dig> % coverage, representing all broad functional gene categories in the genome. the expression profile also helped identify  <dig> potential operon structures involving  <dig>  co-expressed pairs. we also identified  <dig> proteins with mutated/alternate start codons.


CONCLUSIONS
the application of rna-seq based transcriptome profiling to structural gene annotation helped correct existing annotation errors and identify potential novel protein coding regions and srna. we used computational tools to predict regulatory elements such as promoters and terminators associated with the novel expressed regions for further characterization of these novel functional elements. our study complements the existing structural annotation of mannheimia haemolytica phl <dig> based on experimental evidence. given the role of srna in virulence gene regulation and stress response, potential novel srna described in this study can form the framework for future studies to determine the role of srna, if any, in m. haemolytica pathogenesis.
