BACKGROUND
it has been demonstrated that a reliable and fail-safe sequencing strategy is mandatory for high-quality analysis of mitochondrial  dna, as the sequencing and base-calling process is prone to error. here, we present a high quality, reliable and easy handling manual procedure for the sequencing of full mt genomes that is also appropriate for laboratories where fully automated processes are not available.


RESULTS
we amplified whole mitochondrial genomes as two overlapping pcr-fragments comprising each about  <dig> bases in length. we developed a set of  <dig> primers that can be applied to a   <dig> well-based technology, which resulted in at least double strand sequence coverage of the entire coding region .


CONCLUSIONS
this elaborated sequencing strategy is straightforward and allows for an unambiguous sequence analysis and interpretation including sometimes challenging phenomena such as point and length heteroplasmy that are relevant for the investigation of forensic and clinical samples.
