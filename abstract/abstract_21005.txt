BACKGROUND
b. burgdorferi sensu lato  is the etiological agent of lyme borreliosis in humans. spirochetes have adapted themselves to the human immune system in many distinct ways. one important immune escape mechanism for evading complement activation is the binding of complement regulators factor h  or factor h-like protein <dig>  to complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins .


RESULTS
we demonstrate that b. garinii ospa serotype  <dig>  pbi resist complement-mediated killing by binding of fhl- <dig>  to identify the primary ligands of fhl- <dig> four cspa orthologs from b. garinii st <dig> pbi were cloned and tested for binding to human cfh and fhl- <dig>  orthologs bga <dig> and bga <dig> were found to be able to bind both complement regulators but with different intensities. in addition, all cspa orthologs were tested for binding to mammalian and avian cfh. distinct orthologs were able to bind to cfh of different animal origins.


CONCLUSIONS
b. garinii st <dig> pbi is able to evade complement killing and it can bind fhl- <dig> to membrane expressed proteins. recombinant proteins bga <dig> can bind fhl- <dig> and human cfh, while bga <dig> can bind only fhl- <dig>  all recombinant cspa orthologs from b. garinii st <dig> pbi can bind cfh from different animal origins. this partly explains the wide variety of animals that can be infected by b. garinii.
