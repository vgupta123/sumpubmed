BACKGROUND
crambe abyssinica produces high erucic acid  in the seed oil, which can be further increased by reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acid  levels. the omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase enzyme  is known to be involved in pufa biosynthesis. in crambe, three cafad <dig> genes, cafad2-c <dig>  cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> are expressed.


RESULTS
the individual effect of each cafad <dig> gene on oil composition was investigated through studying transgenic lines  for differential expression levels in relation to the composition of seed-oil. six first generation transgenic plants  showed c18: <dig> increase  and pufa reduction . the silencing effect in these t1-plants ranged from the moderate silencing  of all three cafad <dig> genes to strong silencing  of cafad2-c <dig> alone. the progeny of two t1-plants  was further analysed. four or five transgene insertions are characterized in the progeny  of wg19- <dig> in contrast to a single insertion in the t <dig> progeny of wg4- <dig>  for the individual t2-plants of both families , seed-specific silencing of cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> was observed in several individual t2-plants but, on average in both families, the level of silencing of these genes was not significant. a significant reduction in expression level  in both families was only observed for cafad2-c <dig> together with significantly different c18: <dig> and pufa levels in oil.


CONCLUSIONS
cafad2-c <dig> expression is highly correlated to levels of c18: <dig>  and pufa , which suggests that cafad2-c <dig> is the most important one for changing the oil composition of crambe.
