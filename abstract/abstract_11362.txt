BACKGROUND
our previously published reports have described an effective biocontrol agent named pseudomonas sp. m <dig> as its 16s rdna sequence and several regulator genes share homologous sequences with those of p. aeruginosa, but there are several unusual phenotypic features. this study aims to explore its strain specific genomic features and gene expression patterns at different temperatures.


RESULTS
the complete m <dig> genome is composed of a single chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs containing  <dig> open reading frames. seven genomic islands, including two novel prophages and five specific non-phage islands were identified besides the conserved p. aeruginosa core genome. each prophage contains a putative chitinase coding gene, and the prophage ii contains a capb gene encoding a putative cold stress protein. the non-phage genomic islands contain genes responsible for pyoluteorin biosynthesis, environmental substance degradation and type i and iii restriction-modification systems. compared with other p. aeruginosa strains, the fewest number  of insertion sequences and the most number  of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats in m <dig> genome may contribute to the relative genome stability. although the m <dig> genome is most closely related to that of p. aeruginosa strain lesb <dig>  the strain m <dig> is more susceptible to several antimicrobial agents and easier to be erased in a mouse acute lung infection model than the strain lesb <dig>  the whole m <dig> transcriptomic analysis indicated that  <dig> % of the expressed genes are temperature-dependent, with  <dig> genes up-regulated at 28°c in three non-phage genomic islands and one prophage but none at 37°c.


CONCLUSIONS
the p. aeruginosa strain m <dig> has evolved its specific genomic structures and temperature dependent expression patterns to meet the requirement of its fitness and competitiveness under selective pressures imposed on the strain in rhizosphere niche.
