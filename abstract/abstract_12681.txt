BACKGROUND
a qtl mapping study for maize resistance to the mediterranean corn borer  was performed with a ril population derived from the cross b73 × cml <dig>  to develop commercial inbreds of maize resistant to the mcb for use in europe, it would be useful to transfer resistance from tropical germplasm like the subtropical inbred cml <dig> to temperate lines. the inbred b <dig> was chosen as representative of the stiff stock heterotic group, a major heterotic group used in hybrid grown in both north american and europe. the objectives were to study the architecture of genetic factors for resistance to mcb and to check the feasibility of using marker-assisted selection  for transferring those genetic factors.


RESULTS
eight quantitative trait loci  were declared significant for resistance traits and eight qtl were located for agronomic traits. alleles from cml <dig> at qtl significant for tunnel length could reduce tunnel length made for mcb in inbred b <dig> in more than 8 cm; favorable alleles for yield were also found in cml <dig> and no genetic correlation coefficient between tunnel length and yield was detected.


CONCLUSIONS
mas for transferring resistance genes to corn borer attack from cml <dig> to b <dig> could be successful based on cross validation results and a negative effect on yield would not be expected.
