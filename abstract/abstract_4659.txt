BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is one of the essential but often limiting elements for plants. based on transcriptional profiling we reported previously that more than  <dig>  genes are differentially expressed between phosphate -deficient and pi-sufficient arabidopsis roots :1156– <dig>  2012). the current study extends these findings by focusing on the analysis of genes that encode protein kinases  and phosphatases  by mining pk and pp genes that were differentially expressed in response to pi deficiency.


RESULTS
subsets of  <dig>  and  <dig> annotated pk and pp genes were mined on the basis of the tair <dig> release of the arabidopsis genome. analysis of rna-seq data showed that  <dig> pk and  <dig> pp genes were not detected in roots ;  <dig> pk and  <dig> pp showed low abundance . gene ontology analysis revealed that the  <dig> pk genes with no or low expression level in arabidopsis roots are mainly involved in pollen recognition, pollen tube growth or other processes not relevant for root hair formation. more than 50% of the cysteine-rich rlk  subfamily genes belong to this group. among the  <dig> pp genes with no or low expression level, purple acid phosphatases, haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolases, and pp2c genes with functions in the dephosphorylation of rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain and mrna capping were enriched. subsets of  <dig> pk and  <dig> pp genes were differentially expressed under pi-deficient conditions. putative functional modules  of these pk and pp genes were constructed based on co-expression analysis using the maccu toolbox. a co-expression network comprising  <dig> known or annotated pk and pp genes  was subdivided into several highly co-expressed gene sub-clusters. the largest sub-cluster was composed of  <dig> genes, most of which have been assigned to the rlk superfamily and were associated with cell wall metabolism, pollen tube and/or root hair development and growth.


CONCLUSIONS
we here provide comprehensive ‘digital’ transcriptional information on pk and pp genes in arabidopsis roots. the co-expression network derived from our data mining approach sets the stage for follow-up experimentation that helps to complete our understanding of the post-translational regulation of pi deficiency-induced changes in root hair morphogenesis.
