BACKGROUND
we conducted genomic sequencing to identify epstein barr virus  genomes in  <dig> human peripheral blood b lymphocytes that underwent spontaneous immortalization promoted by mycoplasma infections in culture, using the high-throughput sequencing  illumina miseq platform. the purpose of this study was to examine if rapid detection and characterization of a viral agent could be effectively achieved by hts using a platform that has become readily available in general biology laboratories.


RESULTS
raw read sequences, averaging 175 bps in length, were mapped with dna databases of human, bacteria, fungi and virus genomes using the clc genomics workbench bioinformatics tool. overall  <dig>  out of  <dig> , <dig> total reads in one lymphocyte line  and  <dig>  out of  <dig> , <dig> reads in the other lymphocyte line  were identified as ebv sequences. the two ebv genomes with estimated  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold sequence coverage respectively, designated k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv , are characteristic of type- <dig> ebv.


CONCLUSIONS
sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis among k4413-mi ebv, k4123-mi ebv and the ebv genomes previously reported to genbank as well as the na <dig> ebv genome assembled from database of the  <dig> genome project showed that these  <dig> ebvs are most closely related to b95- <dig>  an ebv previously isolated from a patient with infectious mononucleosis and wt-ebv. they are less similar to ebvs associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma  from hong kong and china as well as the akata strain of a case of burkitt’s lymphoma from japan. they are most different from type  <dig> ebv found in western african burkitt’s lymphoma.
