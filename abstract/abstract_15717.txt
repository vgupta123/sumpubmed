BACKGROUND
hiv susceptibility and pathogenicity exhibit both interindividual and intergroup variability. the etiology of intergroup variability is still poorly understood, and could be partly linked to genetic differences among racial/ethnic groups. these genetic differences may be traceable to different regimes of natural selection in the  <dig>  years since the human radiation out of africa. here, we examine population differentiation and haplotype patterns at several loci identified through genome-wide association studies on hiv- <dig> control, as determined by viral-load setpoint, in european and african-american populations. we use genome-wide data from the human genome diversity project, consisting of  <dig> world-wide populations, to compare measures of fst and relative extended haplotype homozygosity  at these candidate loci to the rest of the respective chromosome.


RESULTS
we find that the europe-middle east and europe-south asia pairwise fst in the most strongly associated region are elevated compared to most pairwise comparisons with the sub-saharan african group, which exhibit very low fst. we also find genetic signatures of recent positive selection  at these associated regions among all groups except for sub-saharan africans and native americans. this pattern is consistent with one in which genetic differentiation, possibly due to diversifying/positive selection, occurred at these loci among eurasians.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings are concordant with those from earlier studies suggesting recent evolutionary change at immunity-related genomic regions among europeans, and shed light on the potential genetic and evolutionary origin of population differences in hiv- <dig> control.
