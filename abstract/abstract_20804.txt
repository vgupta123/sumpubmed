BACKGROUND
comprehensive description of the behavior of cellular components in a quantitative manner is essential for systematic understanding of biological events. recent lc-ms/ms  technology, in combination with the silac  method, has enabled us to make relative quantitation at the proteome level. the recent report by blagoev et al.  indicated that this method was also applicable for the time-course analysis of cellular signaling events. relative quatitation can easily be performed by calculating the ratio of peak intensities corresponding to differentially labeled peptides in the ms spectrum. as currently available software requires some gui applications and is time-consuming, it is not suitable for processing large-scale proteome data.


RESULTS
to resolve this difficulty, we developed an algorithm that automatically detects the peaks in each spectrum. using this algorithm, we developed a software tool named ayums that automatically identifies the peaks corresponding to differentially labeled peptides, compares these peaks, calculates each of the peak ratios in mixed samples, and integrates them into one data sheet. this software has enabled us to dramatically save time for generation of the final report.


CONCLUSIONS
ayums is a useful software tool for comprehensive quantitation of the proteome data generated by lc-ms/ms analysis. this software was developed using java and runs on linux, windows, and mac os x. please contact ayums@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp if you are interested in the application. the project web page is .
