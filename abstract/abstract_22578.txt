BACKGROUND
box c/d snornps are responsible for rrna methylation and processing, and are formed by snornas and four conserved proteins, nop <dig>  nop <dig>  nop <dig> and snu <dig>  the snornp assembly is a stepwise process, involving other protein complexes, among which the r2tp and hsp <dig> chaperone. nop <dig>  also known as pih <dig>  has been shown to be a constituent of the r2tp  and to participate in box c/d snornp assembly by its interaction with nop <dig>  the molecular function of nop <dig>  however, has not yet been described.


RESULTS
to shed light on the role played by nop <dig> in the maturation of snornp, here we analyzed the interactions domains of nop <dig> – nop <dig> – tah <dig> and the importance of atp to the interaction between nop <dig> and the atpase rvb1/ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
based on the results shown here, we propose a model for the assembly of box c/d snornp, according to which r2tp complex is important for reducing the affinity of nop <dig> for snorna, and for the binding of the other snornp subunits.
