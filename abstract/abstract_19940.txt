BACKGROUND
since  <dig>  brucella melitensis has been the predominant strain associated with human brucellosis in china. in this study we investigated the genotypic characteristics of b. melitensis isolates from china using a multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis  and evaluated the utility of mlva with regards to epidemiological trace-back investigation.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> b. melitensis strains isolated from throughout china were divided into  <dig> mlva types using mlva- <dig>  nei's genetic diversity indices for the various loci ranged between  <dig>  -  <dig> .  <dig> out  <dig> loci were the low diversity with values <  <dig>  and the most discriminatory markers were bruce <dig> and bruce <dig> with a diversity index of >  <dig>  and containing  <dig> and  <dig> alleles, respectively. many isolates were single-locus or double-locus variants of closely related b. melitensis isolates from different regions, including the north and south of china. using panel  <dig>  the majority of strains  were genotype  <dig> clustering to the 'east mediterranean' b. melitensis group. chinese b. melitensis are classified in limited number of closely related genotypes showing variation mainly at the panel 2b loci.


CONCLUSIONS
the mlva- <dig> assay can be useful to reveal the predominant genotypes and strain relatedness in endemic or non-endemic regions of brucellosis. however it is not suitable for biovar differentiation of b. melitensis. genotype  <dig> is widely distributed throughout china during a long time. bruce  <dig> and bruce  <dig> in panel 2b markers are most useful for typing chinese isolates.
