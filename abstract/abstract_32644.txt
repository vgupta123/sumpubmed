BACKGROUND
the shoot meristem gives rise to new organs throughout a plant’s life by the activity of pluripotent stem cells in the meristem center. organ initiation at the periphery of the shoot meristem is triggered by the accumulation of the phytohormone auxin at the initiation site. loss-of-function mutants of the zwille/argonaute10/pinhead  gene terminate shoot meristem stem cells late in embryogenesis and can form a leaf or a leaf-like structure instead, indicating that ago <dig> activity is required to maintain shoot meristem stem cells undifferentiated.


RESULTS
here, we addressed whether stem cell maintenance by ago <dig> involves regulation of auxin. we found that in zll- <dig> mutants, auxin accumulation and expression of the response reporter dr5:gfp are elevated, and transcription of the auxin response factor  <dig>  gene is upregulated. downregulation of arf <dig> significantly restores stem cells in zll- <dig> mutants, whereas increased expression of arf <dig> enhances differentiation of stem cells in zll- <dig> mutants. we further found that upregulation of the ago <dig> effector gene revoluta restores arf <dig> expression and stem cell maintenance in zll- <dig> embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that maintenance of shoot meristem stem cells by ago <dig> involves negative regulation of auxin signaling and, via rev-mediated downregulation of arf <dig> expression, auxin response.
