BACKGROUND
acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophilic, chemolithoautotrophic bacterium that has been successfully used in metal bioleaching. in this study, an analysis of the a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> genome revealed the presence of three shsp genes, afe_ <dig>  afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig>  that encode proteins from the hsp <dig> family, a class of intracellular multimers that is especially important in extremophile microorganisms.


RESULTS
the expression of the shsp genes was investigated in a. ferrooxidans cells submitted to a heat shock at 40°c for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes. after  <dig> minutes, the gene on locus afe_ <dig> was about 20-fold more highly expressed than the gene on locus afe_ <dig>  bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses showed that the shsps from a. ferrooxidans are possible non-paralogous proteins, and are regulated by the σ <dig> factor, a common transcription factor of heat shock proteins. structural studies using homology molecular modeling indicated that the proteins encoded by afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> have a conserved α-crystallin domain and share similar structural features with the shsp from methanococcus jannaschii, suggesting that their biological assembly involves  <dig> molecules and resembles a hollow spherical shell.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the shsps encoded by the afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> genes are more likely to act as molecular chaperones in the a. ferrooxidans heat shock response. in addition, the three shsps from a. ferrooxidans are not recent paralogs, and the afe_ <dig> and afe_ <dig> genes could be inherited horizontally by a. ferrooxidans.
