BACKGROUND
humans and mice with loss of function mutations in gpr <dig>  or kisspeptin do not progress through puberty, caused by a failure to release gnrh. the transcriptional networks regulated by these proteins in the hypothalamus have yet to be explored by genome-wide methods.


RESULTS
we show here, using  <dig> million exon mouse arrays  and quantitative polymerase chain reaction  validation to analyse microdissected hypothalamic tissue from gpr <dig> and kiss <dig> knockout mice, the extent of transcriptional regulation in the hypothalamus. the sensitivity to detect important transcript differences in microdissected rna was confirmed by the observation of counter-regulation of kiss <dig> expression in gpr <dig> knockouts and confirmed by immunohistochemistry . since gpr <dig> and kiss <dig> knockout animals are effectively pre-pubertal with low testosterone  levels, we also determined which of the validated transcripts were t-responsive and which varied according to genotype alone. we observed four types of transcriptional regulation  genotype only dependent regulation,  t only dependent regulation,  genotype and t-dependent regulation with interaction between these variables,  genotype and t-dependent regulation with no interaction between these variables. the results implicate for the first time several transcription factors , proteases , and the orphan 10-transmembrane transporter tmem <dig> in the biology of gpr54/kisspeptin function in the hypothalamus. we show for the neuronal activity regulated transcription factor npas <dig>  that distinct protein over-expression is seen in the hypothalamus and hippocampus in gpr <dig> knockout mice. this links for the first time the hypothalamic-gonadal axis with this important regulator of inhibitory synapse formation. similarly we confirm tmem <dig> up-regulation in the hypothalamus by rna in situ hybridization and western blot.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, global transcriptional profiling shows that loss of gpr <dig> and kisspeptin are not fully equivalent in the mouse hypothalamus.
