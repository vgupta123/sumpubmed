BACKGROUND
mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant , shows multiple pharmacological actions such as inhibiting presynaptic α <dig> noradrenaline receptor  and selectively activating 5-hydroxytriptamine  1a receptor . mirtazapine was also reported to increase dopamine release in the cortical neurons with 5-ht dependent manner. to examine whether mirtazapine has a therapeutic potency in parkinson’s disease , we examined this compound in 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine -treated mice model of pd.


RESULTS
male c57bl/ <dig> mice were subjected to mptp treatment to establish a pd model. mirtazapine was administered once a day for 3 days after mptp treatment. mptp-induced motor dysfunction, assessed by beam-walking and rota-rod tests, was significantly improved by administration of mirtazapine. biochemical examinations by high performance liquid chromatography and western blot analysis suggested mirtazapine facilitated utilization of dopamine by increasing turnover and protein expression of transporters, without affecting on neurodegenerative process by mptp. these therapeutic effects of mirtazapine were reduced by administration of way <dig>  an inhibitor for 5ht1ar, or of clonidine, a selective agonist for α2-nar, or of prazosin, an inhibitor for α1-nar, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed mirtazapine had a therapeutic potency against pd in a mouse model. because pd patients sometimes show depression together, it will be a useful drug for a future pd treatment.
