BACKGROUND
pax <dig> encodes a transcription factor well-established as an important determinant of mesencephalic identity and superior collicular development. pax <dig> mutant mice, however, present with no obvious morphological impairments to the superior colliculus. this finding is paradoxical and has been attributed to functional redundancy afforded by its paralogue pax <dig>  here we utilise pax <dig> mutant mice to investigate the precise role of this important developmental regulator during superior collicular development and neuronal specification/differentiation. we also assess its spatiotemporal relationship with pax <dig> during embryonic development.


RESULTS
analysis of the superior colliculus of pax <dig> mutant and wildtype mice at a variety of developmental timepoints revealed that whilst correct initial specification is maintained, a subpopulation of dorsal mesencephalic neurons is lost at early postnatal stages. moreover, a comparative analysis of embryonic pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression profiles indicate that pax <dig> expression overlaps extensively with that of pax <dig> initially, but their expression domains increasingly diverge as development progresses, coinciding spatiotemporally with neuronal differentiation and maturation of the tissue. furthermore, pax <dig> expression is perturbed within the cns of embryonic pax <dig> mutant mice.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these results demonstrate that during superior collicular development, pax <dig> is required to maintain a subpopulation of dorsal, mesencephalic neurons and partially regulates, spatiotemporally, pax <dig> expression within the cns. the differential nature of pax <dig> and pax <dig> with respect to neuronal differentiation may have implications for future stem cell therapies aimed at exploiting their developmental capabilities.
