BACKGROUND
streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, is a novel member of the genus streptococcus, falling close to related members like s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. its recent appearance has shed light on streptococcal infections, which has been unclear till recently. in this study, the transcriptome of s. pseudopneumoniae ccug 49455t was analyzed using the s. pneumoniae r <dig> microarray platform and compared with those of s. pneumoniae kctc 5080t, s. mitis kctc 3556t, and s. oralis kctc 13048t strains.


RESULTS
comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the extent of genetic relatedness among the species, and implies that s. pseudopneumoniae is the most closely related to s. pneumoniae. a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were upregulated while  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were downregulated relative to s. pneumoniae in s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis and s. mitis respectively. important findings were the up-regulation of tcs  and transposase which were found to be specific to s. pseudopneumoniae.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides insight to the current understanding of the genomic content of s. pseudopneumoniae. the comparative transcriptome analysis showed hierarchical clustering of expression data of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. pneumoniae and s. mitis with s. oralis. this proves that transcriptional profiling can facilitate in elucidating the genetic distance between closely related strains.
