BACKGROUND
inguinal hernias are usually caused by a congenital defect, which occurs as a weakness of the inguinal canal. porcine Î²-glucuronidase gene  was chosen as functional candidate gene because of its involvement in degradation of hyaluronan within gubernacular tissue during descent of testes. since a genome-wide linkage analysis approach has shown evidence that two regions on porcine chromosome  <dig>  are involved in the inheritance of hernia inguinalis/scrotalis in german pig breeds, gusb also attained status as a positional candidate gene by its localization within a hernia-associated chromosomal region.


RESULTS
a contig spanning  <dig>  bp, which contains the entire gusb, was assembled. comparative sequence analyses were conducted for the gusb gene locus. single nucleotide polymorphisms  located within the coding region of gusb were genotyped in  <dig> animals. results of transmission disequilibrium test  for two out of a total of five detected snps gave no significant association with the outcome of hernia in pigs.


CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of our studies we are able to exclude the two analyzed snps within the porcine gusb gene as causative for the transmission of inguinal hernia.
