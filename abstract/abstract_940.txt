BACKGROUND
the functions of three zona glycoproteins, zp <dig>  zp <dig> and zp <dig> during the sperm-zona pellucida  interaction are now well established in mice. the expression of an additional zona glycoprotein, zpb/ <dig>  in humans, led us to reconsider the classical mouse model of gamete interaction. we investigated the various functions of human zp  during the interaction of spermatozoa with fertilised and unfertilised oocytes.


RESULTS
the hzp of fertilised oocytes retained their ability to bind sperm , to induce an intraspermatic calcium influx through voltage-dependent channels similar to that observed with hzp from unfertilised oocytes and to promote the acrosome reaction at a rate similar to that induced by the zp of unfertilised oocytes . conversely, the rate of hzp penetrated by sperm was much lower for fertilised than for unfertilised oocytes . we investigated the status of zp <dig> in the oocytes used in the functional tests, and demonstrated that sperm binding and acrosome reaction induction, but not zp penetration, occurred whether or not zp <dig> was cleaved.


CONCLUSIONS
the change in zp function induced by fertilisation could be different in human and mouse species. our results suggest a zona blocking to polyspermy based at the sperm penetration level in humans.
