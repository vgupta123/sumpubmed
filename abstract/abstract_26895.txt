BACKGROUND
palmitoylation, the addition of palmitate to proteins by palmitoyl acyltransferases , is an important regulator of synaptic protein localization and function. many palmitoylated proteins and pats have been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, including huntington disease, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, alzheimer disease, and x-linked intellectual disability. hip14/dhhc <dig> is the most conserved pat that palmitoylates many synaptic proteins. hip <dig> hypomorphic mice have behavioral and synaptic deficits. however, the phenotype is developmental; thus, a model of post-developmental loss of hip <dig> was generated to examine the role of hip <dig> in synaptic function in the adult.


RESULTS
ten weeks after hip <dig> deletion , mice die suddenly from rapidly progressive paralysis. prior to death the mice exhibit motor deficits, increased escape response during tests of anxiety, anhedonia, a symptom indicative of depressive-like behavior, and striatal synaptic deficits, including reduced probability of transmitter release and increased amplitude but decreased frequency of spontaneous post-synaptic currents. the mice also have increased brain weight due to microgliosis and astrogliosis in the cortex.


CONCLUSIONS
behavioral changes and electrophysiological measures suggest striatal dysfunction in ihip14
Δ/Δ mice, and increased cortical volume due to astrogliosis and microgliosis suggests a novel role for hip <dig> in glia. these data suggest that hip <dig> is essential for maintenance of life and neuronal integrity in the adult mouse.
