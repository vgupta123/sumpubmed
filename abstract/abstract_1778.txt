BACKGROUND
salmonella typhimurium  is an important cause of foodborne outbreaks worldwide. subtyping of stm remains critical to outbreak investigation, yet current techniques  may provide insufficient discrimination. whole genome sequencing  offers potentially greater discriminatory power to support infectious disease surveillance.

methods
we performed wgs on  <dig> stm isolates of a single, endemic mlva type associated with two epidemiologically independent, food-borne outbreaks along with sporadic cases in new south wales, australia, during  <dig>  genomes of case and environmental isolates were sequenced using hiseq  and the genetic distance between them was assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis. snp analysis was compared to the epidemiological context.


RESULTS
the wgs analysis supported epidemiological evidence and genomes of within-outbreak isolates were nearly identical. sporadic cases differed from outbreak cases by a small number of snps, although their close relationship to outbreak cases may represent an unidentified common food source that may warrant further public health follow up. previously unrecognised mini-clusters were detected.


CONCLUSIONS
wgs of stm can discriminate foodborne community outbreaks within a single endemic mlva clone. our findings support the translation of wgs into public health laboratory surveillance of salmonellosis.
