BACKGROUND
soybean is a valuable crop that provides protein and oil. soybean requires a large amount of nitrogen  to accumulate high levels of n in the seed. the yield and protein content of soybean seeds are directly affected by the n-use efficiency  of the plant, and improvements in nue will improve yields and quality of soybean products. genetic engineering is one of the approaches to improve nue, but at present, it is hampered by the lack of information on genes associated with nue. solexa sequencing is a new method for estimating gene expression in the transcription level. here, the expression profiles were analyzed between two soybean varieties in n-limited conditions to identify genes related to nue.


RESULTS
two soybean genotypes were grown under n-limited conditions; a low-n-tolerant variety  and a low-n-sensitive variety . the shoots and roots of soybeans were used for sequencing. eight libraries were generated for analysis:  <dig> genotypes ×  <dig> tissues  ×  <dig> time periods  and compared the transcriptomes by high-throughput tag-sequencing analysis.  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> clean tags were obtained for the eight libraries: l <dig>  116-shoot short-term; l <dig> 84-70-shoot short-term; l <dig> 116-shoot long-term; l <dig> 84-70-shoot long-term; l <dig> 116-root short-term; l <dig> 84-70-root short-term; l <dig> 116-root long-term;l <dig> 84-70-root long-term; these corresponded to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct tags, respectively. the clean tags were mapped to the reference sequences for annotation of expressed genes. many genes showed substantial differences in expression among the libraries. in total,  <dig> genes involved in twenty-two metabolic and signal transduction pathways were up- or down-regulated. twenty-four genes were randomly selected and confirmed their expression patterns by quantitative rt-pcr; twenty-one of the twenty-four genes showed expression patterns consistent with the digital gene expression  data.


CONCLUSIONS
a number of soybean genes were differentially expressed between the low-n-tolerant and low-n-sensitive varieties under n-limited conditions. some of these genes may be candidates for improving nue. these findings will help to provide a detailed understanding of nue mechanisms, and also provide a basis for breeding soybean varieties that are tolerant to low-n conditions.
