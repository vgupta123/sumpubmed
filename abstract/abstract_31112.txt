BACKGROUND
members of the proteolipid protein family, including the four-transmembrane glycoprotein m6a, are involved in neuronal plasticity in mammals. results from our group previously demonstrated that m <dig>  the only proteolipid protein expressed in drosophila, localizes to the cell membrane in follicle cells. m <dig> loss triggers female sterility, which suggests a role for m <dig> in follicular cell remodeling. these results were the basis of the present study, which focused on the function and requirements of m <dig> in the fly nervous system.


RESULTS
the present study identified two novel, tissue-regulated m <dig> isoforms with variable n- and c- termini, and showed that m <dig> is the functional fly ortholog of gpm6a. in the adult brain, the protein was localized to several neuropils, such as the optic lobe, the central complex, and the mushroom bodies. interestingly, although reduced m <dig> levels triggered a mild rough-eye phenotype, hypomorphic m <dig> mutants exhibited a defective response to light.


CONCLUSIONS
based on its ability to induce filopodium formation we propose that m <dig> is key in cell remodeling processes underlying visual system function. these results bring further insight into the role of m6/m6a in biological processes involving neuronal plasticity and behavior in flies and mammals.
