BACKGROUND
half-smooth tongue sole  has been exploited as a commercially important cultured marine flatfish, and female grows 2– <dig> times faster than male. genetic studies, especially on the chromosomal sex-determining system of this species, have been carried out in the last decade. although the genome of half-smooth tongue sole was relatively small , there are still some difficulties in the high-quality assembly of the next generation genome sequencing reads without the assistance of a physical map, especially for the w chromosome of this fish due to abundance of repetitive sequences. the objective of this study is to construct a bacterial artificial chromosome -based physical map for half-smooth tongue sole with the method of high information content fingerprinting .


RESULTS
a physical map of half-smooth tongue sole was constructed with  <dig>   <dig> valid fingerprints  with a tolerance of  <dig> and an initial cutoff of 1e- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  clones were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 539 kb and a n <dig> length of 664 kb. there were  <dig> contigs longer than the n <dig> length, and these contigs will be a useful resource for future integration with linkage map and whole genome sequence assembly. the estimated physical length of the assembled contigs was 797 mb, representing approximately  <dig>  coverage of the half-smooth tongue sole genome. the largest contig contained  <dig> bac clones with a physical length of  <dig>  mb. almost all of the  <dig> bac clones  in the  <dig> randomly selected contigs were positively validated by pcr assays, thereby confirming the reliability of the assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
a first generation bac-based physical map of half-smooth tongue sole was constructed with high reliability. the map will promote genetic improvement programs of this fish, especially integration of physical and genetic maps, fine-mappings of important gene and/or qtl, comparative and evolutionary genomics studies, as well as whole genome sequence assembly.
