BACKGROUND
coffee is an important crop and is crucial to the economy of many developing countries, generating around us$ <dig> billion per year. there are  <dig> species in the coffea genus, but only two, c. arabica and c. canephora, are commercially cultivated. coffee plants are attacked by many pathogens and insect-pests, which affect not only the production of coffee but also its grain quality, reducing the commercial value of the product. the main insect-pest, the coffee berry borer , is responsible for worldwide annual losses of around us$ <dig> million. the coffee berry borer exclusively damages the coffee berries, and it is mainly controlled by organochlorine insecticides that are both toxic and carcinogenic. unfortunately, natural resistance in the genus coffea to h. hampei has not been documented. to overcome these problems, biotechnological strategies can be used to introduce an α-amylase inhibitor gene , which confers resistance against the coffee berry borer insect-pest, into c. arabica plants.


RESULTS
we transformed c. arabica with the α-amylase inhibitor- <dig> gene  from the common bean, phaseolus vulgaris, under control of the seed-specific phytohemagglutinin promoter . the presence of the α-ai <dig> gene in six regenerated transgenic t <dig> coffee plants was identified by pcr and southern blotting. immunoblotting and elisa experiments using antibodies against α-ai <dig> inhibitor showed a maximum α-ai <dig> concentration of  <dig> % in crude seed extracts. inhibitory in vitro assays of the α-ai <dig> protein against h. hampei α-amylases in transgenic seed extracts showed up to 88% inhibition of enzyme activity.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report showing the production of transgenic coffee plants with the biotechnological potential to control the coffee berry borer, the most important insect-pest of crop coffee.
