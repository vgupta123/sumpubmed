BACKGROUND
probability based statistical learning methods such as mutual information and bayesian networks have emerged as a major category of tools for reverse engineering mechanistic relationships from quantitative biological data. in this work we introduce a new statistical learning strategy, mi <dig> that addresses three common issues in previous methods simultaneously:  handling of continuous variables,  detection of more complex three-way relationships and  better differentiation of causal versus confounding relationships. with these improvements, we provide a more realistic representation of the underlying biological system.


RESULTS
we test the mi <dig> algorithm using both synthetic and experimental data. in the synthetic data experiment, mi <dig> achieved an absolute sensitivity/precision of  <dig> / <dig>  and a relative sensitivity/precision both of  <dig> . in addition, mi <dig> significantly outperformed the control methods, including bayesian networks, classical two-way mutual information and a discrete version of mi <dig>  we then used mi <dig> and control methods to infer a regulatory network centered at the myc transcription factor from a published microarray dataset. models selected by mi <dig> were numerically and biologically distinct from those selected by control methods. unlike control methods, mi <dig> effectively differentiated true causal models from confounding models. mi <dig> recovered major myc cofactors, and revealed major mechanisms involved in myc dependent transcriptional regulation, which are strongly supported by literature. the mi <dig> network showed that limited sets of regulatory mechanisms are employed repeatedly to control the expression of large number of genes.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our work demonstrates that mi <dig> outperforms the frequently used control methods, and provides a powerful method for inferring mechanistic relationships underlying biological and other complex systems. the mi <dig> method is implemented in r in the "mi3" package, available under the gnu gpl from  and from the r package archive cran.
