BACKGROUND
chaperones facilitate proper folding of peptides and bind to misfolded proteins as occurring during periods of cell stress. complexes of peptides with chaperones induce peptide-directed immunity. here we analyzed the interaction of proinsulin with the best characterized chaperone of the hsp <dig> family, bacterial dnak.


RESULTS
of a set of overlapping 13-mer peptides of human preproinsulin high affinity binding to dnak was found for the signal peptide and one further region in each proinsulin domain . among the latter, peptides covering most of the b-chain region b11- <dig> exhibited strongest binding, which was in the range of known high-affinity dnak ligands, dissociation equilibrium constant  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. the b-chain region b11- <dig> is located at the interface between two insulin molecules and not accessible in insulin oligomers. indeed, native insulin oligomers showed very low dnak affinity  whereas a proinsulin molecule modified to prevent oligomerization showed good binding affinity .


CONCLUSIONS
intact insulin only weakly interacts with the hsp <dig> chaperone dnak whereas monomeric proinsulin and peptides from  <dig> distinct proinsulin regions show substantial chaperone binding. strongest binding was seen for the b-chain peptide b 11- <dig>  interestingly, peptide b11- <dig> represents a dominant autoantigen in type  <dig> diabetes.
