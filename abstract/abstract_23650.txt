BACKGROUND
it is not clear how foreign dna molecules insert into the host genome. recently, we have produced transgenic mice to investigate the role of the fad <dig> gene in the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid. here we describe an integration mechanism of fad <dig> transgene by homologous illegitimate random integration.


RESULTS
we confirmed that one fad <dig> line had a sole integration site on the x chromosome according to the inheritance patterns. mapping of insertion sequences with thermal asymmetric interlaced and conventional pcr revealed that the foreign dna was inserted into the xc <dig> region of the x chromosome by a homologous illegitimate replacement of an entire  <dig> -bp endogenous genomic region, including the ovarian granulosa cell tumourigenesis- <dig> allele. for 5' and 3' junction sequences, there were very short  common sequences in the at-rich domains, which may mediate the recognition of the homologous arms between the transgene and the host genome. in addition, analysis of gene transcription indicated that the transgene was expressed in all tested fad <dig> tissues and that its transcription level in homozygous female tissues was about twice as high as in the heterozygous female .


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the results indicated that the foreign fad <dig> behaved like an x-linked gene and that foreign dna molecules were inserted into the eukaryotic genome through a homologous illegitimate random integration.
