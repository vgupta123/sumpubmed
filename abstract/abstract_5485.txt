BACKGROUND
guide picker  serves as a meta tool for designing crispr experiments by presenting ten different guide rna scoring functions in one simple graphical interface. it allows investigators to simultaneously visualize and sort through every guide targeting the protein-coding regions of any mouse or human gene.


RESULTS
utilizing a multidimensional graphical display featuring two plots and four axes, guide picker can analyze all guides while filtering based on four different criteria at a time. guide picker further facilitates the crispr design process by using pre-computed scores for all guides, thereby offering rapid guide rna generation and selection.


CONCLUSIONS
the ease-of-use of guide picker complements crispr itself, matching a powerful and modular biological system with a flexible online web tool that can be used in a variety of genome editing experimental contexts.
