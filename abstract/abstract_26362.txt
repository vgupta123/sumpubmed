BACKGROUND
the genes coding for y rnas are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. these non-coding rnas are essential for the initiation of chromosomal dna replication in vertebrate cells. however thus far, no information is available about y rnas in chinese hamster cells, which have already been used to detect replication origins and alternative dna structures around these sites. here, we report the gene sequences and predicted structural characteristics of the chinese hamster y rnas, and analyze their ability to support the initiation of chromosomal dna replication in vitro.


RESULTS
we identified dna sequences in the chinese hamster genome of four y rnas  with upstream promoter sequences, which are homologous to the four main types of vertebrate y rnas. the chy <dig>  chy <dig> and chy <dig> genes were highly conserved with their vertebrate counterparts, whilst the chy <dig> gene showed a relatively high degree of diversification from the other vertebrate y <dig> genes. molecular dynamics simulations suggest that chy <dig> rna is structurally stable despite its evolutionarily divergent predicted stem structure. of the four y rna genes present in the hamster genome, we found that only the chy <dig> and chy <dig> rna were strongly expressed in the chinese hamster gma <dig> cell line, while expression of the chy <dig> and chy <dig> rna genes was five orders of magnitude lower, suggesting that they may in fact not be expressed. we synthesized all four chy rnas and showed that any of these four could support the initiation of dna replication in an established human cell-free system.


CONCLUSIONS
these data therefore establish that non-coding chy rnas are stable structures and can substitute for human y rnas in a reconstituted cell-free dna replication initiation system. the pattern of y rna expression and functionality is consistent with y rnas of other rodents, including mouse and rat.
