BACKGROUND
addictive disorders are a class of chronic, relapsing mental disorders that are responsible for increased risk of mental and medical disorders and represent the largest, potentially modifiable cause of death. tobacco dependence is associated with increased risk of disease and premature death. while tobacco control efforts and therapeutic interventions have made good progress in reducing smoking prevalence, challenges remain in optimizing their effectiveness based on patient characteristics, including genetic variation. in order to maximize collaborative efforts to advance addiction research, we have developed a genotyping array called smokescreen. this custom array builds upon previous work in the analyses of human genetic variation, the genetics of addiction, drug metabolism, and response to therapy, with an emphasis on smoking and nicotine addiction.


RESULTS
the smokescreen genotyping array includes  <dig>  markers in  <dig> categories. the array design covers genome-wide common variation , east asian , and european  respectively); most of the variation with a minor allele frequency ≥  <dig>  in  <dig> addiction genes ; and nearly all variation from the  <dig> genomes project phase  <dig>  nhlbi go exome sequencing project and hapmap databases in the regions related to smoking behavior and nicotine metabolism: chrna5-chrna3-chrnb <dig> and cyp2a6-cyp2b <dig>  of the  <dig> pilot dna samples derived from blood or cell line biospecimens that were genotyped on the array,  <dig>  passed quality control. in passing samples,  <dig>  % of markers passed quality control. the genotype reproducibility in  <dig> replicate pairs was  <dig>  %. for  <dig> samples that overlapped with hapmap <dig> release  <dig>  the genotype concordance was  <dig>  %. in a genome-wide association analysis of the nicotine metabolite ratio in  <dig> individuals participating in nicotine metabolism laboratory studies, we identified genome-wide significant variants in the cyp2a <dig> region .


CONCLUSIONS
we developed a comprehensive genotyping array for addiction research and demonstrated its analytic validity and utility through pilot genotyping of hapmap and study samples. this array allows researchers to perform genome-wide, candidate gene, and pathway-based association analyses of addiction, tobacco-use, treatment response, comorbidities, and associated diseases in a standardized, high-throughput platform.
