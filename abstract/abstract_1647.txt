BACKGROUND
salmonella are frequently isolated from chickens and their products. prevalent serogroups and serovars of salmonella as well as their genotypes and antibiograms were determined for cloacal samples from  <dig> chickens. to understand the possible serovar and h antigens for transmission between chicken and human, serovars and their h antigens of  <dig> chicken and  <dig> human isolates were compared.


RESULTS
prevalence of salmonella differed among chicken lines and ages. chicken and human isolates belonged mainly to serogroup b, c <dig>  c2-c <dig>  d, and e.  <dig> serovars and  <dig> serovars were identified for chicken and human isolates respectively. the common serovars for chicken and human isolates were s. typhimurium, s. enteritidis, s. albany, s. derby, and s. anatum and shared common h <dig> antigens "g complex; i; e,h; and z <dig> z24" and h <dig> antigens " <dig> complex and -". in human isolates, h <dig> antigen "i" and h <dig> antigen "-" were common in all serogroups. in chicken, antimicrobial susceptibility differed among serogroups, serovars and three counties. all isolates were susceptible to cefazolin and ceftriaxone, but highly resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, flumequine, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. except those isolates of serogroup c <dig> of chick group and serogroup g, all isolates were multi-drug resistance. only s. kubacha, s. typhimurium, s. grampian, and s. mons were resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or enrofloxacin.


CONCLUSIONS
in chicken, prevalent serogroups and serovars were associated with chicken ages, lines and regions; and flouroquinolone-resistant and mdr isolates emerged. h <dig> antigens "g complex and i" and h <dig> antigens " <dig> complex and -" might be important for transmission of salmonella between chicken and human.
