BACKGROUND
the coronator group currently encompasses six morphologically similar species . culex coronator has been incriminated as a potential vector of west nile virus , saint louis encephalitis virus , and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus . the complete mitochondrial genome of cx. coronator, cx. usquatus, cx.usquatissimus, and cx. camposi was sequenced, annotated, and analyzed to provide genetic information about these species.


RESULTS
the mitochondrial genomes of cx. coronator, cx. usquatus, cx.usquatissimus, and cx. camposi varied from  <dig>  base pairs in cx. usquatus to  <dig>  in cx. coronator. they contained  <dig> genes  and the at-rich control region. comparative analyses of the  <dig> genes demonstrated the mitochondrial genomes to be composed of variable and conserved genes. despite the small size, the atp <dig>  atp <dig> plus nadh <dig> protein-encoding genes were polymorphic, whereas trnas and rrnas were conserved. the control region contained some poly-t stretch. the bayesian phylogenetic tree corroborated that both the coronator group and the culex pipens complex are monophyletic taxa.


CONCLUSIONS
the mitochondrial genomes of cx. coronator, cx. usquatus, cx. usquatissimus and cx. camposi share the same gene composition and arrangement features that match to those reported for most culicidae species. they are composed of the same  <dig> genes and the at-rich control region, which contains poly-t stretches that may be involved in the functional role of the mitochondrial genome. taken together, results of the dn/ds ratios, the sliding window analyses and the bayesian phylogenetic analyses suggest that atp <dig>  atp <dig> and nadh <dig> are promising genes to be employed in phylogenetic studies involving species of the coronator group, and probably other species groups of the subgenus culex. bayesian topology corroborated the morphological hypothesis of the coronator group as monophyletic lineage within the subgenus culex.
