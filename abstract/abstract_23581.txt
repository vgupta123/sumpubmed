BACKGROUND

solanum pimpinellifolium has high breeding potential for fruit quality traits and has been used as a donor in tomato breeding programs. unlocking the genetic potential of s. pimpinellifolium requires high-throughput polymorphism identification protocols for qtl mapping and introgression of favourable alleles into cultivated tomato by both positive and background selection.


RESULTS
in this study we identified snp loci using a genotyping by sequencing  approach in an ibl mapping population derived from the cross between a high yielding fresh market tomato and s. pimpinellifolium  as the recurrent and donor parents, respectively. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated by the illumina hiseq next-generation sequencing platform. from these reads  <dig>  sequence tags were generated. a majority of the sequence tags  were uniquely aligned to the tomato genome. a total of  <dig>  unique snp loci were identified as a result of tag alignment to the genome assembly and were used in qtl analysis of  <dig> fruit quality traits. as a result,  <dig> qtls were identified. s. pimpinellifolium contributed favourable alleles for  <dig> qtls , thus confirming the high breeding potential of this wild species.



CONCLUSIONS
the present work introduced a set of snps at sufficiently high density for qtl mapping in populations derived from s. pimpinellifolium . moreover, this study demonstrated the high efficiency of the gbs approach for snp identification, genotyping and qtl mapping in an interspecific tomato population.
