BACKGROUND
perinatal exposure to hyperhomocysteinemia might disturb neurogenesis during brain development and growth. also, high levels of homocysteine trigger neurodegeneration in several experimental models. however, the putative mechanisms of homocysteine-induced toxicity in the developing nervous system have poorly been elucidated. this study was aimed to investigate homocysteine effects in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells, neuro2a.


RESULTS
a  <dig> h exposure to homocysteine in a concentration range of 10– <dig> μm did not affect cell viability and ros production in neuro2a cell cultures. instead, ros levels were increased by two-three folds in cells treated with  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm homocysteine, respectively, in comparison with control cells. also, the highest homocysteine dose significantly reduced the viable cell number by 40%. notably, the treatment with homocysteine  in the presence of antioxidants, such as n-acetylcysteine and irfi  <dig>  a synthetic α-tocopherol analogue, recovered cell viability and significantly reduced homocysteine-evoked increases in ros production. moreover, antioxidants, particularly irfi  <dig>  were able to counteract nf-κb activation induced by  <dig> μm homocysteine.

cell treatment with  <dig> μm homocysteine also triggered the onset of apoptosis, as demonstrated by the increased expression of early apoptotic markers such as bax, caspase- <dig> and p <dig>  in contrast, bcl <dig> expression was not affected by homocysteine exposure. interestingly, the specific inhibition of nf-κb nuclear translocation by the synthetic peptide sn <dig> was able to almost completely suppress the homocysteine-evoked rises in pro-apoptotic protein expression as well as in caspase- <dig> activity. further, also irfi  <dig> and n-acetylcysteine were able to significantly reduce caspase- <dig> activation induced by homocysteine treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations suggest an involvement of redox state alterations and activated nf-κb in apoptosis onset triggered by homocysteine in neuroblastoma cells neuro2a. however, further investigations are needed to characterize molecular events involved in the nf-κb activation induced by homocysteine.
