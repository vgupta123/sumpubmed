BACKGROUND
gene duplication is central to genome evolution. in plants, genes can be duplicated through small-scale events and large-scale duplications often involving polyploidy. the apple belongs to the subtribe pyrinae , a diverse lineage that originated via allopolyploidization. both small-scale duplications and polyploidy may have been important mechanisms shaping the genome of this species.


RESULTS
this study evaluates the gene duplication and polyploidy history of the apple by characterizing duplicated genes in this species using est data. overall, 68% of the apple genes were clustered into families with a mean copy-number of  <dig> . analysis of the age distribution of gene duplications supported a continuous mode of small-scale duplications, plus two episodes of large-scale duplicates of vastly different ages. the youngest was consistent with the polyploid origin of the pyrinae 37- <dig> mybp, whereas the older may be related to Î³-triplication; an ancient hexapolyploidization previously characterized in the four sequenced eurosid genomes and basal to the eurosid-asterid divergence. duplicated genes were studied for functional diversification with an emphasis on young paralogs; those originated during or after the formation of the pyrinae lineage. unequal assignment of single-copy genes and gene families to gene ontology categories suggested functional bias in the pattern of gene retention of paralogs. young paralogs related to signal transduction, metabolism, and energy pathways have been preferentially retained. non-random retention of duplicated genes seems to have mediated the expansion of gene families, some of which may have substantially increased their members after the origin of the pyrinae. the joint analysis of over-duplicated functional categories and phylogenies, allowed evaluation of the role of both polyploidy and small-scale duplications during this process. finally, gene expression analysis indicated that 82% of duplicated genes, including 80% of young paralogs, showed uncorrelated expression profiles, suggesting extensive subfunctionalization and a role of gene duplication in the acquisition of novel patterns of gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reports a genome-wide analysis of the mode of gene duplication in the apple, and provides evidence for its role in genome functional diversification by characterising three major processes: selective retention of paralogs, amplification of gene families, and changes in gene expression.
