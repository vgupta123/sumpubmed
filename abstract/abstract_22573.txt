BACKGROUND
camelids and sharks possess a unique subclass of antibodies comprised of only heavy chains. the antigen binding fragments of these unique antibodies can be cloned and expressed as single domain antibodies . the ability of these small antigen-binding molecules to refold after heating to achieve their original structure, as well as their diminutive size, makes them attractive candidates for diagnostic assays.


RESULTS
here we describe the isolation of an sdab against staphyloccocus aureus enterotoxin b . the clone, a <dig>  was found to have high affinity  and good specificity for seb, showing no cross reactivity to related molecules such as staphylococcal enterotoxin a , staphylococcal enterotoxin d , and shiga toxin. most remarkably, this anti-seb sdab had an extremely high tm of 85°c and an ability to refold after heating to 95°c. the sharp tm determined by circular dichroism, was found to contrast with the gradual decrease observed in intrinsic fluorescence. we demonstrated the utility of this sdab as a capture and detector molecule in luminex based assays providing limits of detection  of at least  <dig> pg/ml.


CONCLUSIONS
the anti-seb sdab a <dig> was found to have a high affinity and an extraordinarily high tm and could still refold to recover activity after heat denaturation. this combination of heat resilience and strong, specific binding make this sdab a good candidate for use in antibody-based toxin detection technologies.
