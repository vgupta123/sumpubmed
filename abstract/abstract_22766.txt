BACKGROUND
the sperm annulus is a septin-based fibrous ring structure connecting the midpiece and the principal piece of the mammalian sperm flagellum. although ultrastructural abnormalities and functional importance of the annulus have been addressed in sept4-null mutant mice and a subset of human patients with asthenospermia syndrome, little is known about how the structure is assembled and positioned to the midpiece-principal piece junction during mammalian sperm flagellum development.


RESULTS
by performing immunofluorescence and biochemical approaches with antibodies against dnajb <dig> and an annulus constituent sept <dig>  we report here a spatiotemporal association of dnajb <dig> with sperm annulus during mouse sperm flagellum development. dnajb <dig> co-localized with sept <dig> to the annulus, and both were first able to be detected in step  <dig> spermatids. as spermiogenesis proceeded, the annular dnajb <dig> immunosignal increased until the annulus reached the midpiece-principal piece junction, and then gradually disappeared from it in late spermiogenesis. in contrast, the sept <dig> immunosignal was relatively unaltered, and still present on annulus of mature spermatozoa. in sept4-null mouse spermatids lacking the annulus structure, the annulus-like dnajb <dig> immunosignal was still able to be detected, albeit weaker, at the neck region of the flagella. in vitro dnajb <dig> was co-localized and interacted with sept <dig> directly.


CONCLUSIONS
the direct interaction of dnajb <dig> with sept <dig> in vitro and its spatiotemporal association with the annulus during sperm flagellum development, and even its annulus-like appearance in the annulus-deficient spermatids, suggest that dnajb <dig> may be involved in assembling the annulus structure and positioning it towards the midpiece-principal piece junction.
