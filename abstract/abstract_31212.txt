BACKGROUND
hemotropic mycoplasmas  are emerging zoonotic pathogens with a worldwide distribution that can cause mild to severe hemolytic anemia, icterus, ill-thrift, infertility, and poor weight gain. however, understanding of the molecular epidemiology of hemoplasmas  is limited in sheep and goats, and the hemoplasma strain/species/variant ‘candidatus m. haemovis’ was poorly studied throughout the world and had never been detected in china until now. thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the molecular prevalence of hemoplasmas, including m. ovis and ‘candidatus m. haemovis’ in sheep and goats from seven provinces and one autonomous region of china.

methods
a total of  <dig> blood samples were collected from sheep and goats in seven provinces and one autonomous region of china. all blood samples were tested for hemoplasmas  by nested pcr amplification based on 16s rrna gene. positive specimens underwent nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.


RESULTS
overall,  <dig> specimens  were shown to be hemoplasmas  -positive by nested pcr amplification based on 16s rrna gene. the prevalence in goats was  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  in sheep, while that in grazing small ruminants was  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in house feeding small ruminants. sequencing of the nearly complete 16s rrna gene was successful for the  <dig> randomly selected positive specimens from different farms in different sampling sites of china. among them, analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences identified m. ovis  and ‘candidatus m. haemovis’ . two  of the four novel genotypes obtained in this study were closely related to m. ovis, while the other two genotypes  had high identity with ‘candidatus m. haemovis’. remarkably, the genotype  of m. ovis in sheep and goats in this study fell in a clade with two human hemoplasmas from usa  and shared  <dig> %– <dig> % with them.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, ‘candidatus m. haemovis’ was first detected in chinese sheep and goats and hemoplasmas  are highly prevalent, and widely distributed in china.
