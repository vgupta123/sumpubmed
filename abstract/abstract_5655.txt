BACKGROUND
the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca <dig> encodes a multifunctional tumor suppressor protein brca <dig>  which is involved in regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle, transcription, dna repair, dna damage response and chromatin remodeling. brca <dig> protein, located primarily in cell nuclei, interacts with multiple proteins and various dna targets. it has been demonstrated that brca <dig> protein binds to damaged dna and plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes. as a key protein in the repair of dna double-strand breaks, the brca1-dna binding properties, however, have not been reported in detail.


RESULTS
in this study, we provided detailed analyses of brca <dig> protein  binding to topologically constrained non-b dna structures . using electrophoretic retardation assay, atomic force microscopy and dna binding competition assay, we showed the greatest preference of the brca <dig> dna-binding domain to cruciform structure, followed by dna quadruplex, with the weakest affinity to double stranded b-dna and single stranded dna. while preference of the brca <dig> protein to cruciform structures has been reported previously, our observations demonstrated for the first time a preferential binding of the brca <dig> protein also to triplex and quadruplex dnas, including its visualization by atomic force microscopy.


CONCLUSIONS
our discovery highlights a direct brca <dig> protein interaction with dna. when compared to double stranded dna, such a strong preference of the brca <dig> protein to cruciform and quadruplex structures suggests its importance in biology and may thus shed insight into the role of these interactions in cell regulation and maintenance.
