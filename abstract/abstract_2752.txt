BACKGROUND
concrete corrosion of wastewater collection systems is a significant cause of deterioration and premature collapse. failure to adequately address the deteriorating infrastructure networks threatens our environment, public health, and safety. analysis of whole-metagenome pyrosequencing data and 16s rrna gene clone libraries was used to determine microbial composition and functional genes associated with biomass harvested from crown  and invert  sections of a corroded wastewater pipe.


RESULTS
taxonomic and functional analysis demonstrated that approximately 90% of the total diversity was associated with the phyla actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes and proteobacteria. the top  and bottom pipe  communities were different in composition, with some of the differences attributed to the abundance of sulfide-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. additionally, human fecal bacteria were more abundant in the bp communities. among the functional categories, proteins involved in sulfur and nitrogen metabolism showed the most significant differences between biofilms. there was also an enrichment of genes associated with heavy metal resistance, virulence  and stress response in the tp biofilm, while a higher number of genes related to motility and chemotaxis were identified in the bp biofilm. both biofilms contain a high number of genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds subsystems.


CONCLUSIONS
the function potential of wastewater biofilms was highly diverse with level of cog diversity similar to that described for soil. on the basis of the metagenomic data, some factors that may contribute to niche differentiation were ph, aerobic conditions and availability of substrate, such as nitrogen and sulfur. the results from this study will help us better understand the genetic network and functional capability of microbial members of wastewater concrete biofilms.
