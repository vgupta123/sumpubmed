BACKGROUND
cluster of differentiation  <dig>  functions as a co-receptor for toll-like receptor - <dig> and myeloid differentiation factor - <dig> in detecting bacterial lipopolysaccharide. together, these complexes promote the phagocytosis and digestion of gram-negative bacteria, and initiate immune responses. to date, much of our understanding of cd <dig> function during gram-negative bacterial inflammation comes from studies on mouse knockout models and cell transfection. to identify the effect of cd <dig> knockdown in this process in large livestock animals, we established a mouse model expressing bovine cd <dig> short hairpin  rna. shrna fragments targeting bovine cd <dig> were screened by co-transfection in hek  <dig> cells, and the most effective cd <dig> shrna fragment was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector psilencer <dig> -cd <dig> shrna-ires  and transferred into mouse zygotes by pronuclear microinjection to obtain transgenic mice. expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein  reporter and genes related to the tlr <dig> signaling pathway was detected by immunohistochemistry  and quantitative polymerase chain reaction , respectively.


RESULTS
one effective shrna fragment  targeting bovine cd <dig> was obtained, the sequence of which was shown to be conserved between cows, buffalos, sheep, and humans. thirty-seven founder pups were obtained by pronuclear microinjection, of which three were positive for the transgene. in the f <dig> generation,  <dig> of  <dig> mice  were positive for the transgene as detected by pcr. ihc analysis detected exogenous egfp expression in the liver, kidney, and spleen of transgenic f <dig> mice, indicating that they were chimeric. the expression of endogenous cd <dig> mrna in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of transgenic f <dig> mice was decreased 8-, 3-,  <dig> -, 6-, and 11-fold, respectively. the expression patterns of endogenous md- <dig>  tlr <dig>  interleukin- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor-α genes in transgenic mice also varied.


CONCLUSIONS
this study confirms that transgenic mice expressing bovine cd <dig> shrna can be generated by pronuclear microinjection, and demonstrates inhibited endogenous mouse cd <dig> expression that alters gene expression related to the tlr <dig> signaling pathway.
