BACKGROUND
a growing number of trp channels have been identified as key players in the sensation of smell, temperature, mechanical forces and taste. trpm <dig> is known to be abundantly expressed in taste receptor cells where it participates in sweet, amino acid and bitter perception. a role of trpm <dig> in other sensory systems, however, has not been studied so far.


RESULTS
here, we systematically investigated the expression of trpm <dig> in rat and mouse tissues. apart from taste buds, where we found trpm <dig> to be predominantly localized on the basolateral surface of taste receptor cells, trpm <dig> immunoreactivity was seen in other chemosensory organs â€“ the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ. most strikingly, we found solitary trpm5-enriched epithelial cells in all parts of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. based on their tissue distribution, the low cell density, morphological features and co-immunostaining with different epithelial markers, we identified these cells as brush cells . in terms of morphological characteristics, brush cells resemble taste receptor cells, while their origin and biological role are still under intensive debate.


CONCLUSIONS
we consider trpm <dig> to be an intrinsic signaling component of mammalian chemosensory organs, and provide evidence for brush cells being an important cellular correlate in the periphery.
