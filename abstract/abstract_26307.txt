BACKGROUND
acanthamoebae polyphaga mimivirus  is the largest known dsdna virus. the viral particle has a nearly icosahedral structure with an internal capsid shell surrounded with a dense layer of fibrils. a capsid protein sequence, d13l, was deduced from the apm l <dig> coding gene and was shown to be the most abundant protein found within the viral particle. however this protein remained poorly characterised until now. a revised protein sequence deposited in a database suggested an additional n-terminal stretch of  <dig> amino acids missing from the original deduced sequence. this result led us to investigate the l <dig> gene structure and the biochemical properties of the complete apm major capsid protein.


RESULTS
this study describes the full length  <dig> bp capsid coding gene and characterises the  <dig> amino acids long corresponding capsid protein  <dig>  the recombinant full length protein allowed the production of a specific monoclonal antibody able to detect the capsid protein  <dig> within the viral particle. this protein appeared to be post-translationnally modified by glycosylation and phosphorylation. we proposed a secondary structure prediction of apm capsid protein  <dig> compared to the capsid protein structure of paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  <dig>  another member of the nucleo-cytoplasmic large dna virus family.


CONCLUSIONS
the characterisation of the full length l <dig> capsid coding gene of acanthamoebae polyphaga mimivirus provides new insights into the structure of the main capsid protein. the production of a full length recombinant protein will be useful for further structural studies.
