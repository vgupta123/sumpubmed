BACKGROUND
non-typeable haemophilus influenzae  is a gram negative microorganism residing in the human nasopharyngeal mucosa and occasionally causing infections of both middle ear and lower respiratory airways. a broadly protective vaccine against nthi has been a long-unmet medical need, as the high genetic variability of this bacterium has posed great challenges.


RESULTS
in this study, we developed a robust serum bactericidal assay  to optimize the selection of protective antigens against nthi. sba takes advantage of the complement-mediated lysis of bacterial cells and is a key in vitro method for measuring the functional activity of antibodies. as a proof of concept, we assessed the bactericidal activity of antibodies directed against antigens known to elicit a protective response, including protein d used as carrier protein in the synflorix pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. prior to sba screening, the accessibility of antigens to antibodies and the capacity of the latter to induce c <dig> complement deposition was verified by flow cytometry. using baby rabbit serum as a source of complement, the proposed assay not only confirmed the bactericidal activity of the antibodies against the selected vaccine candidates, but also showed a significant reproducibility.


CONCLUSIONS
considering the rapidity and cost-effectiveness of this novel sba protocol, we conclude that it is likely to become an important tool to prove the capability of antibodies directed against recombinant antigens to induce nthi in vitro killing and to both select new protective vaccine candidates, and predict vaccine efficacy.
