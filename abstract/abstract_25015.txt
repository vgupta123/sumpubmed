BACKGROUND
the first generation of genome sequence assemblies and annotations have had a significant impact upon our understanding of the biology of the sequenced species, the phylogenetic relationships among species, the study of populations within and across species, and have informed the biology of humans. as only a few metazoan genomes are approaching finished quality , there is room for improvement of most genome assemblies. the honey bee  genome, published in  <dig>  was noted for its bimodal gc content distribution that affected the quality of the assembly in some regions and for fewer genes in the initial gene set  compared to what would be expected based on other sequenced insect genomes.


RESULTS
here, we report an improved honey bee genome assembly  with a new gene annotation set , and show that the honey bee genome contains a number of genes similar to that of other insect genomes, contrary to what was suggested in ogsv <dig> . the new genome assembly is more contiguous and complete and the new gene set includes ~ <dig> more protein-coding genes, 50% more than previously reported. about 1/ <dig> of the additional genes were due to improvements to the assembly, and the remaining were inferred based on new rnaseq and protein data.


CONCLUSIONS
lessons learned from this genome upgrade have important implications for future genome sequencing projects. furthermore, the improvements significantly enhance genomic resources for the honey bee, a key model for social behavior and essential to global ecology through pollination.
