BACKGROUND
claudins, a family of protein localized in tight junctions, are essential for the control of paracellular permeation in epithelia and endothelia. the interaction of several claudins with clostridium perfringens enterotoxin  has been exploited for an affinity-based enrichment of cpe-binding claudins from lysates of normal rat cholangiocytes.


RESULTS
immunoblotting and mass spectrometry  experiments demonstrate strong enrichment of the cpe-binding claudins - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  indicating specific association with glutathione-s-transferase -cpe116– <dig> fusion protein. in parallel, the co-elution of  claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> was observed. the complete set of co-enriched proteins was identified by ms after electrophoretic separation. relative mass spectrometric protein quantification with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture  made it possible to discriminate specific binding from non-specific association to gst and/or matrix material.


CONCLUSIONS
cpe116– <dig> provides an efficient tool for single step enrichment of different claudins from cell lysates. numerous proteins were shown to be co-enriched with the cpe-binding claudins, but there are no indications  for an association with tight junctions.
