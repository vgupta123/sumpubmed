BACKGROUND
after a prolonged exposure to a paired presentation of different types of signals , one of the signals  becomes a driver for the other signal . this phenomenon, which is known as contingent motion aftereffect, indicates that the brain can establish new neural representations even in the adult's brain. however, contingent motion aftereffect has been reported only in visual or auditory domain. here, we demonstrate that a visual motion aftereffect can be contingent on a specific sound.


RESULTS
dynamic random dots moving in an alternating right or left direction were presented to the participants. each direction of motion was accompanied by an auditory tone of a unique and specific frequency. after a 3-minutes exposure, the tones began to exert marked influence on the visual motion perception, and the percentage of dots required to trigger motion perception systematically changed depending on the tones. furthermore, this effect lasted for at least  <dig> days.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that a new neural representation can be rapidly established between auditory and visual modalities.
