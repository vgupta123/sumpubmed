BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is an important cause of intestinal infections in some animal species and animals might be a reservoir for community associated human infections. here we describe a collection of animal associated c. difficile strains from  <dig> countries based on inclusion criteria of one strain  per animal species per laboratory.


RESULTS
altogether  <dig> isolates were collected and distributed into  <dig> pcr ribotypes with agarose based approach and  <dig> pcr ribotypes with sequencer based approach. four pcr ribotypes were most prevalent in terms of number of isolates as well as in terms of number of different host species:  <dig> , 014/ <dig> ;  <dig>  and  <dig> . two animal hosts were best represented; cattle with  <dig> isolates  and pigs with  <dig> isolates .


CONCLUSIONS
this results show that although pcr ribotype  <dig> is often reported as the major animal c. difficile type, especially in pigs, the variability of strains in pigs and other animal hosts is substantial. most common human pcr ribotypes  are also among most prevalent animal associated c. difficile strains worldwide. the widespread dissemination of toxigenic c. difficile and the considerable overlap in strain distribution between species furthers concerns about interspecies, including zoonotic, transmission of this critically important pathogen.
