BACKGROUND
plastome sequences for  <dig> species of the pacmad grasses  were analyzed phylogenomically. next generation sequencing methods were used to provide complete plastome sequences for  <dig> species. sanger sequencing was performed to determine the plastome of one species, hakonechloa macra, to provide a reference for annotation. these analyses were conducted to resolve deep subfamilial relationships within the clade. divergence estimates were assessed to determine potential factors that led to the rapid radiation of this lineage and its dominance of warmer open habitats.


RESULTS
new plastomes were completely sequenced and characterized for  <dig> pacmad species. an autapomorphic ~1140 bp deletion was found in hakonechloa macra putatively pseudogenizing rpl <dig> and eliminating rpl <dig> from this plastome. phylogenomic analyses support panicoideae as the sister group to the acmad clade. complete plastome sequences provide greater support at deep nodes within the pacmad clade. the initial diversification of pacmad subfamilies was estimated to occur at  <dig>  mya.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenomic analyses of complete plastomes provides resolution for deep relationships of pacmad grasses. the divergence estimate of  <dig>  mya at the crown node of the pacmad clade coincides with the eocene-oligocene transition . the eocene was a period of global cooling and drying, which led to forest fragmentation and the expansion of open habitats now dominated by these grasses. understanding how these grasses are related and determining a cause for their rapid radiation allows for future predictions of grassland distribution in the face of a changing global climate.
