BACKGROUND
in dairy cows, the periparturient phase is a stressful period, which is commonly associated with strong metabolic adaptations and the development of pathophysiologic conditions and disorders. some of the symptoms occurring in the liver, such as the development of fatty liver, are similar to those observed under the condition of endoplasmic reticulum  stress. therefore, we hypothesized, that in the liver of dairy cows er stress is induced during the periparturient phase, which in turn leads to an induction of the unfolded protein response . in order to investigate this hypothesis, we determined relative mrna concentrations of  <dig> genes of the er stress-induced upr in liver biopsy samples of  <dig> dairy cows at  <dig> wk antepartum and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wk postpartum.


RESULTS
we found, that the mrna concentrations of  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes involved in the upr in the liver were significantly increased  at  <dig> wk postpartum compared to  <dig> wk antepartum. from  <dig> wk postpartum to later lactation, mrna concentrations of all the genes considered were declining. moreover, at  <dig> wk postpartum, mrna concentration of the spliced variant of xbp <dig> was increased in comparison to  <dig> wk antepartum, indicating that splicing of xbp <dig> â€“ a hallmark of er stress - was induced following the onset of lactation.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study reveals, that er stress might be induced during the periparturient phase in the liver of dairy cows. we assume that the er stress-induced upr might contribute to the pathophysiologic conditions commonly observed in the liver of periparturient cows, such as the development of fatty liver, ketosis or inflammation.
