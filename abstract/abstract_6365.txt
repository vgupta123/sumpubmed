BACKGROUND
yersinia pestis is the causative agent of pneumonic plague; recently, we and others reported that during the first 24- <dig> hours after pulmonary infection with y. pestis pro-inflammatory cytokine expression is undetectable in lung tissues.


RESULTS
here, we report that, intranasal infection of mice with co <dig> delta yoph mutant results in an early pro-inflammatory response in the lungs characterized by an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin one-beta  <dig> hours post-infection. co <dig> delta yoph colonizes the lung but does not disseminate to the liver or spleen and is cleared from the host within  <dig> hours post-infection. this is different from what is observed in a wild-type co <dig> infection, where pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and immune cell infiltration into the lungs is not detectable until 36- <dig> h post-infection. co <dig> rapidly disseminates to the liver and spleen resulting in high bacterial burdens in these tissues ultimately cumulating in death 72- <dig> h post-infection. mice deficient in tnf-alpha are more susceptible to co <dig> delta yoph infection with 40% of the mice succumbing to infection.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our results suggest that yoph can inhibit an early pro-inflammatory response in the lungs of mice and that this is an important step in the pathogenesis of infection.
