BACKGROUND
the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect on outcomes of intraoperative recombinant human interleukin- <dig> injection after surgical resection of peripheral nerve sheath tumours. in this double-blind trial,  <dig> patients due to undergo surgical excision  of presumed peripheral nerve sheath tumours were randomized to receive intraoperative injection of interleukin- <dig> or placebo into the wound bed.


RESULTS
there were no significant differences in any variable investigated or in median survival between the two groups. the median recurrence free interval was 874Â days , the recurrence-free interval and overall survival time were significantly longer in dogs that undergone the primary surgery by a specialist-certified surgeon compared to a referring veterinarian regardless of whether additional adjunct therapy was given.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, marginal excision of peripheral nerve sheath tumours in dogs resulted in a long survival time, but adjuvant treatment with recombinant human interleukin- <dig>  did not provide a survival advantage.
