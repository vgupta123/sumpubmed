BACKGROUND
cell elongation is mainly limited by the extensibility of the cell wall. dicotyledonous primary  cell walls contain cellulose, xyloglucan, pectin and proteins, but little is known about how each polymer class contributes to the cell wall mechanical properties that control extensibility.


RESULTS
we present evidence that the degree of pectin methyl-esterification  limits cell growth, and that a minimum level of about 60% de is required for normal cell elongation in arabidopsis hypocotyls. when the average de% falls below this level, as in two gibberellic acid  mutants ga1- <dig> and gai, and plants expressing pectin methyl-esterase  from aspergillus aculeatus, then hypocotyl elongation is reduced.


CONCLUSIONS
low average levels of pectin de% are associated with reduced cell elongation, implicating pmes, the enzymes that regulate de%, in the cell elongation process and in responses to ga. at high average de% other components of the cell wall limit ga-induced growth.
