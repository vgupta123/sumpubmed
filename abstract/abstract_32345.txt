BACKGROUND
astaxanthin is a carotenoid pigment that possesses potent antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities. previous studies have demonstrated that astaxanthin displays potential neuroprotective properties for the treatment of central nervous system diseases, such as ischemic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage. this study explored whether astaxanthin is neuroprotective and ameliorates neurological deficits following traumatic brain injury .


RESULTS
our results showed that, following cci, treatment with astaxanthin compared to vehicle ameliorated neurologic dysfunctions after day  <dig> and alleviated cerebral edema and evans blue extravasation at 24 h . astaxanthin treatment decreased aqp <dig> and nkcc <dig> mrna levels in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h. aqp <dig> and nkcc <dig> protein expressions in the peri-contusional cortex were significantly reduced by astaxanthin at 24 h . furthermore, we also found that bumetanide , an inhibitor of nkcc <dig>  inhibited trauma-induced aqp <dig> upregulation .


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that astaxanthin reduces tbi-related injury in brain tissue by ameliorating aqp4/nkcc1-mediated cerebral edema and that nkcc <dig> contributes to the upregulation of aqp <dig> after tbi.
