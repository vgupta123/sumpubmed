BACKGROUND
carboxyl-terminal protease  plays essential functions in posttranslational protein processing in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. to date, only a few bacterial ctpa genes have been characterized. here we cloned and characterized a novel ctpa. the encoding gene, ctpap , was derived from p. lautus chn <dig>  a gram-positive bacterium isolated by functional screening. recombinant protein was obtained from protein over-expression in escherichia coli and the biochemical properties of the enzyme were investigated.


RESULTS
screening of environmental sediment samples with a skim milk-containing medium led to the isolation of a p. lautus chn <dig> strain that exhibited a high proteolytic activity. a gene encoding a carboxyl-terminal protease  was cloned from the isolate and characterized. the deduced mature protein contains  <dig> aa with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, displaying 29-38% amino acid sequence identity to characterized bacterial ctpa enzymes. ctpap contains an unusual catalytic dyad  and a pdz substrate-binding motif, characteristic for carboxyl-terminal proteases. ctpap was expressed as a recombinant protein and characterized. the purified enzyme showed an endopeptidase activity, which effectively cleaved α s1- and β- casein substrates at carboxyl-terminus as well as at multiple internal sites. furthermore, ctpap exhibited a high activity at room temperature and strong tolerance to conventional protease inhibitors, demonstrating that ctpap is a novel endopeptidase.


CONCLUSIONS
our work on ctpa represents the first investigation of a member of family ii ctpa enzymes. the gene was derived from a newly isolated p. lautus chn <dig> strain exhibiting a high protease activity in the skim milk assay. we have demonstrated that ctpap is a novel endopeptidase with distinct cleavage specificities, showing a strong potential in biotechnology and industry applications.
