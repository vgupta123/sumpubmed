BACKGROUND
rapeseed  is an important oilseed crop throughout the world, serving as source for edible oil and renewable energy. development of nested association mapping  population and methods is of importance for quantitative trait locus  mapping in rapeseed. the objectives of the research were to compare the power of qtl detection 1- β∗   of two mating designs, double haploid  and backcross ,  of different statistical models, and  for different genetic situations.


RESULTS
the computer simulations were based on the empirical data of a single nucleotide polymorphism  set of  <dig> snps from  <dig> sequenced conserved genes of  <dig> accessions of world-wide diverse b. napus germplasm. the results showed that a joint composite interval mapping  model had significantly higher power of qtl detection than a single marker model. the dh-nam mating design showed a slightly higher power of qtl detection than the bc-nam mating design. the jcim model considering qtl effects nested within subpopulations showed higher power of qtl detection than the jcim model considering qtl effects across subpopulations, when examing a scenario in which there were interaction effects by a few qtls interacting with a few background markers as well as a scenario in which there were interaction effects by many qtls  each with more than  <dig> background markers and the proportion of total variance explained by the interactions was higher than  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study support the optimal design as well as analysis of nam populations, especially in rapeseed.
