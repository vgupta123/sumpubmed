BACKGROUND
microsatellites are the most popular source of molecular markers for studying population genetic variation in eukaryotes. however, few data are currently available about their genomic distribution and abundance across the phylum nematoda. the recent completion of the genomes of several nematode species, including meloidogyne incognita, a major agricultural pest worldwide, now opens the way for a comparative survey and analysis of microsatellites in these organisms.


RESULTS
using msatfinder, the total numbers of 1- <dig> bp perfect microsatellites detected in the complete genomes of five nematode species  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and covered from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the nematode genomes. under our search criteria, the most common repeat motifs for each length class varied according to the different nematode species considered, with no obvious relation to the at-richness of their genomes. overall, n, n and n were the three most frequent dinucleotide microsatellite motifs found in the five genomes considered. except for two motifs in p. pacificus, all the most frequent trinucleotide motifs were at-rich, with n and n being the only common to the five nematode species. a particular attention was paid to the microsatellite content of the plant-parasitic species m. incognita. in this species, a repertoire of  <dig>  microsatellite loci was identified, from which  <dig>  appeared suitable to design markers for population genetic studies. interestingly,  <dig>  microsatellites were identified in  <dig> predicted protein-coding regions, 99% of them being trinucleotides. when compared against the interpro domain database,  <dig> of these cds were successfully annotated, and further assigned to gene ontology terms.


CONCLUSIONS
contrasted patterns of microsatellite abundance and diversity were characterized in five nematode genomes, even in the case of two closely related meloidogyne species.  <dig>  di- to hexanucleotide loci were identified in the genome of m. incognita, providing adequate material for the future development of a wide range of microsatellite markers in this major plant parasite.
