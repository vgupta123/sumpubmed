BACKGROUND
the recent increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotics has promoted the exploration of novel antibacterial materials. as a result, many researchers are undertaking work to identify new lantibiotics because of their potent antimicrobial activities. the objective of this study was to provide details of a lantibiotic-like gene cluster in paenibacillus elgii b <dig> and to produce the antibacterial substances coded by this gene cluster based on culture screening.


RESULTS
analysis of the p. elgii b <dig> genome sequence revealed the presence of a lantibiotic-like gene cluster composed of five open reading frames . screening of culture extracts for active substances possessing the predicted properties of the encoded product led to the isolation of four novel peptides  with a broad inhibitory spectrum. the molecular weights of these peptides were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> da, respectively. the n-terminal sequence of elgicin b was leu-gly-asp-tyr, which corresponded to the partial sequence of the peptide elga encoded by elga. edman degradation suggested that the product elgicin b is derived from elga. by correlating the results of electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analyses of elgicins ai, aii, and c, these peptides are deduced to have originated from the same precursor, elga.


CONCLUSIONS
a novel lantibiotic-like gene cluster was shown to be present in p. elgii b <dig>  four new lantibiotics with a broad inhibitory spectrum were isolated, and these appear to be promising antibacterial agents.
