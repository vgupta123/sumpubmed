BACKGROUND
spi <dig> is an essential transcription factor  for the hematopoietic lineage, in which its expression is tightly controlled through a −17-kb upstream regulatory region and a promoter region. both regulatory regions are demethylated during hematopoietic development, although how the change of dna methylation status is performed is still unknown.


RESULTS
we found that the ectopic overexpression of runx <dig>  in hek-293t cells induces almost complete dna demethylation at the −17-kb upstream regulatory region and partial but significant dna demethylation at the proximal promoter region. this dna demethylation occurred in mitomycin-c-treated nonproliferating cells at both regulatory regions, suggesting active dna demethylation. furthermore, ectopic runx <dig> expression induced significant endogenous spi <dig> expression, although its expression level was much lower than that of natively spi1-expressing monocyte cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest the novel role of runx <dig> as an inducer of dna demethylation at the spi <dig> regulatory regions, although the mechanism of runx1-induced dna demethylation remains to be explored.
