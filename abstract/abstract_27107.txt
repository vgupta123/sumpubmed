BACKGROUND
brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by brucella infection. in the late fifties, brucella suis vaccine strain s <dig> with reduced virulence was obtained by serial transfer of a virulent b. suis biovar  <dig> strain in china. it has been widely used for vaccination in china since  <dig>  until now, the mechanisms underlie virulence attenuation of s <dig> are still unknown.


RESULTS
in this paper, the whole genome sequencing of s <dig> was carried out by illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing method. we further performed the comparative genomic analysis to find out the differences between s <dig> and the virulent brucella suis strain  <dig>  we found premature stops in outer membrane autotransporter omaa and eryd genes. single mutations were found in phosphatidylcholine synthase, phosphorglucosamine mutase, pyruvate kinase and flif, which have been reported to be related to the virulence of brucella or other bacteria. of the other different proteins between s <dig> and  <dig>  such as omp2b, periplasmic sugar-binding protein, and oligopeptide abc transporter, no definitive implications related to bacterial virulence were found, which await further investigation.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here provided the rational basis for designing brucella vaccines that could be used in other strains.
