BACKGROUND
breakpoint cluster region  is a multi-domain protein that contains a c-terminal gtpase activating protein  domain for rac. transglutaminase  <dig>  regulates bcr by direct binding to its gap domain. since tg <dig> has transglutaminase activity that has been implicated in the response to extreme stress, we investigated if bcr can also act as a substrate for tg <dig> 


RESULTS
we here report that activation of tg <dig> by calcium caused the formation of covalently cross-linked bcr. abr, a protein related to bcr but lacking its n-terminal oligomerization domain, was not cross-linked by tg <dig> even though it forms a complex with it. a bcr mutant missing the first  <dig> amino acid residues remained monomeric in the presence of activated tg <dig>  showing that this specific domain is necessary for the cross-linking reaction. calcium influx induced by a calcium ionophore in primary human endothelial cells caused cross-linking of endogenous bcr, which was inhibited by the tg <dig> inhibitor cystamine. treatment of cells with cobalt chloride, a hypoxia-mimetic that causes cellular stress, also generated high molecular weight bcr complexes. cross-linked bcr protein appeared in the tritonx-100-insoluble cell fraction and further accumulated in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
bcr thus represents both an interacting partner under non-stressed conditions and a target of transglutaminase activity for tg <dig> during extreme stress.
