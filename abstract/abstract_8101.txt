BACKGROUND
the pathogenic fungus fonsecaea pedrosoi constitutively produces the pigment melanin, an important virulence factor in fungi. melanin is incorporated in the cell wall structure and provides chemical and physical protection for the fungus.

we evaluated the production of nitric oxide  in macrophages, the oxidative burst and the inducible nitric oxide synthase  activity in interactions between activated murine macrophages and f. pedrosoi. experiments were carried out with or without tricyclazole  treatment, a selective inhibitor of the dihydroxynaphthalene -melanin biosynthesis pathway in f. pedrosoi. the paramagnetisms of melanin and the tc-melanin were analysed by electron spin resonance. the fungal growth responses to h2o <dig> and to s-nitroso-n-acetylpenicillamine , a nitric oxide donor, were also evaluated.


RESULTS
melanised f. pedrosoi cells were more resistant to both h2o <dig> and no. nitrite was not detected in the supernatant of macrophages incubated with melanised fungal cells. however, i-nos expression was unaffected by the presence of either untreated control f. pedrosoi or tc-treated f. pedrosoi. in addition, the inhibition of the dhn-melanin pathway by tc improved the oxidative burst capability of the macrophages.


CONCLUSIONS
the no-trapping ability of f. pedrosoi melanin is an important mechanism to escape the oxidative burst of macrophages.
