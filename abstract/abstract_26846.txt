BACKGROUND
gene expression data are a rich source of information about the transcriptional dis-regulation of genes in cancer. genes that display differential regulation in cancer are a subtype of cancer biomarkers.


RESULTS
we present an approach to mine expressed sequence tags to discover cancer biomarkers. a false discovery rate analysis suggests that the approach generates less than 22% false discoveries when applied to combined human and mouse whole genome screens. with this approach, we identify the  <dig> genes most consistently differentially expressed in cancer  and proceed to characterize these genes. when used for prediction in a variety of cancer classification tasks , we show that hm <dig> and the shorter gene list hm <dig> are very competitive cancer biomarker sets. indeed, when compared to  <dig> published cancer marker gene lists, hm <dig> achieves the best or second best classification performance in 79% of the classifications considered.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate the existence of at least one general cancer marker set whose predictive value spans several tumor types and classification types. our comparison with other marker gene lists shows that hm <dig> markers are mostly novel cancer markers. we also identify the previously published pomeroy- <dig> list as another general cancer marker set. strikingly, pomeroy- <dig> has  <dig> genes in common with hm <dig>  our data suggest that a core set of genes are responsive to the deregulation of pathways involved in tumorigenesis in a variety of tumor types and that these genes could serve as transcriptional cancer markers in applications of clinical interest. finally, our study suggests new strategies to select and evaluate cancer biomarkers in microarray studies.
