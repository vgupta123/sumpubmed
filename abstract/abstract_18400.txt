BACKGROUND
progressive accumulation of α-synuclein  protein in different brain regions is a hallmark of synucleinopathic diseases, such as parkinson’s disease, dementia with lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. α-syn transgenic mouse models have been developed to investigate the effects of α-syn accumulation on behavioral deficits and neuropathology. however, the onset and progression of pathology in α-syn transgenic mice have not been fully characterized. for this purpose we investigated the time course of behavioral deficits and neuropathology in pdgf-β human wild type α-syn transgenic mice  between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age.


RESULTS
these mice showed progressive impairment of motor coordination of the limbs that resulted in significant differences compared to non-transgenic littermates at  <dig> and  <dig> months of age. biochemical and immunohistological analyses revealed constantly increasing levels of human α-syn in different brain areas. human α-syn was expressed particularly in somata and neurites of a subset of neocortical and limbic system neurons. most of these neurons showed immunoreactivity for phosphorylated human α-syn confined to nuclei and perinuclear cytoplasm. analyses of the phenotype of α-syn expressing cells revealed strong expression in dopaminergic olfactory bulb neurons, subsets of gabaergic interneurons and glutamatergic principal cells throughout the telencephalon. we also found human α-syn expression in immature neurons of both the ventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream, but not in the dentate gyrus.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that the pdgf-β α-syn transgenic mouse model presents with early and progressive accumulation of human α-syn that is accompanied by motor deficits. this information is essential for the design of therapeutical studies of synucleinopathies.
