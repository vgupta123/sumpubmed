BACKGROUND
influenza infection may be more serious in human immunodeficiency virus -infected individuals, therefore, vaccination against seasonal and pandemic strains is highly advised. seasonal influenza vaccines have had no significant negative effects in well controlled hiv infection, but the impact of adjuvanted pandemic a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> influenza hemaglutinin  vaccine, which was used for the first time in the canadian population as an authorized vaccine in autumn  <dig>  has not been extensively studied.

objective
assess vaccine-related effects on cd4+ t cell counts and humoral responses to the vaccine in individuals attending the newfoundland and labrador provincial hiv clinic.

methods
a single dose of arepanrixtm split vaccine including  <dig>  μg a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen and aso <dig> adjuvant was administered to  <dig> hiv-infected individuals by intramuscular injection. plasma samples from shortly before, and 1–5 months after vaccination were collected from 80/ <dig> individuals to assess humoral anti-h1n <dig> ha responses using a sensitive microbead-based array assay. data on cd4+ t cell counts, plasma viral load, antiretroviral therapy and patient age were collected from clinical records of  <dig> individuals.


RESULTS
overall, 36/ <dig> responded to vaccination either by seroconversion to h1n <dig> ha or with a clear increase in anti-h1n <dig> ha antibody levels. approximately 1/ <dig>  had pre-existing anti-h1n <dig> ha antibodies and were more likely to respond to vaccination . responders had higher baseline cd4+ t cell counts and responders without pre-existing antibodies against h1n <dig> ha were younger than either non-responders or responders with pre-existing antibodies. compared to changes in their cd4+ t cell counts observed over a similar time period one year later, vaccine recipients displayed a minor, transient fall in cd4+ t cell numbers, which was greater amongst responders.


CONCLUSIONS
we observed low response rates to the  <dig> pandemic influenza vaccine among hiv-infected individuals without pre-existing antibodies against h1n <dig> ha and a minor transient fall in cd4+ t cell numbers, which was accentuated in responders. a single injection of the arepanrixtm pandemic a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha split vaccine may be insufficient to induce protective immunity in hiv-infected individuals without pre-existing anti-h1n <dig> ha responses.
