BACKGROUND
adult mesenchymal stem cells  derived from adipose tissue have the capacity to differentiate into mesenchymal as well as endodermal and ectodermal cell lineage in vitro. we characterized the multipotent ability of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells  as mscs and investigated the neural differentiation potential of these cells.


RESULTS
human adscs from earlobe fat maintained self-renewing capacity and differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes under specific culture conditions. following neural induction with bfgf and forskolin, hadscs were differentiated into various types of neural cells including neurons and glia in vitro. in neural differentiated-hadscs , the immunoreactivities for neural stem cell marker , neuronal markers , astrocyte marker , and oligodendrocyte marker  were significantly increased than in the primary hadscs. rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that the mrna levels encoding for abcg <dig>  nestin, tuj <dig>  map <dig>  nfl, nfm, nse, gap <dig>  snap <dig>  gfap, and cnpase were also highly increased in ni-hadscs. moreover, ni-hadscs acquired neuron-like functions characterized by the display of voltage-dependent tetrodotoxin -sensitive sodium currents, outward potassium currents, and prominent negative resting membrane potentials under whole-cell patch clamp recordings. further examination by rt-pcr showed that ni-hadscs expressed high level of ionic channel genes for sodium , potassium , and calcium channels , which were expressed constitutively in the primary hadscs. in addition, we demonstrated that kv <dig>  and eag <dig>  potassium channel genes, and ne-na, a ttx-sensitive sodium channel gene, were highly induced following neural differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
these combined results indicate that hadscs have the same self-renewing capacity and multipotency as stem cells, and can be differentiated into functional neurons using bfgf and forskolin.
