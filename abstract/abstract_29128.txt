BACKGROUND
wheat is one of the most important cereal crops for human beings, with seeds being the tissue of highly economic value. various morphogenetic and metabolic processes are exclusively associated with seed maturation. the goal of this study was to screen and identify genes specifically expressed in the developing seed of wheat with an integrative utilization of digital differential display  and available online microarray databases.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> unigenes were identified as the results of ddd screening and microarray database searching. the expressions of  <dig> of these were shown to be seed-specific by qrt-pcr analysis. further go enrichment analysis indicated that seed-specific genes were mainly associated with defense response, response to stress, multi-organism process, pathogenesis, extracellular region, nutrient reservoir activity, enzyme inhibitor activity, antioxidant activity and oxidoreductase activity. a comparison of this set of genes with the rice  genome was also performed and approximately three-fifths of them have rice counterparts. between the counterparts, around 63% showed similar expression patterns according to the microarray data.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the ddd screening combined with microarray data analysis is an effective strategy for the identification of seed-specific expressed genes in wheat. these seed-specific genes screened during this study will provide valuable information for further studies about the functions of these genes in wheat.
