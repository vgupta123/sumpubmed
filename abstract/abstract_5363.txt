BACKGROUND
detailed descriptions of the early development of parasitic nematodes are seldom available. the embryonic development of the plant-parasitic nematode meloidogyne incognita was studied, focusing on the early events.


RESULTS
a fixed pattern of repeated cell cleavages was observed, resulting in the appearance of the six founder cells  <dig> days after the first cell division. gastrulation, characterized by the translocation of cells from the ventral side to the center of the embryo, was seen  <dig> day later. approximately  <dig> days after the first cell division a rapidly elongating two-fold stage was reached. the fully developed second stage juvenile hatched approximately  <dig> days after the first cell division.


CONCLUSIONS
when compared to the development of the free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans, the development of m. incognita occurs approximately  <dig> times more slowly. furthermore, m. incognita differs from c. elegans in the order of cell divisions, and the early cleavage patterns of the germ line cells. however, cytoplasmic ruffling and nuclear migration prior to the first cell division as well as the localization of microtubules are similar between c. elegans and m. incognita.
