BACKGROUND
fusarium wilt is an economically devastating disease that affects banana production. although cavendish banana cultivars are resistant to fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race  <dig>  and maitain banana production after gros michel was destructed by race  <dig>  a new race race  <dig>  was found to infect cavendish.


RESULTS
an exopolygalacturonase  was isolated and purified from the supernatant of the plant pathogen fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race  <dig> . pgc <dig> had an apparent mr of  <dig> kda by sds-page and  <dig>  kda by mass spectrometry. the enzyme was n-glycosylated. pgc <dig> hydrolyzed polygalacturonic acid in an exo-manner, as demonstrated by analysis of degradation products. to obtain adequate amounts of protein for functional studies between the pgc <dig> proteins of two races of the pathogen, pgc <dig> genes encoding pgc <dig> from race  <dig>  and race  <dig> , both  <dig> bp in length and encoding  <dig> amino acids with a predicted amino-terminal signal sequence of  <dig> residues, were cloned into the expression vector ppiczaa and then expressed in pichia pastoris strains of smd <dig>  the recombinant pgc <dig> products, r-foc1-pgc <dig> and r-foc4-pgc <dig>  were expressed and purified as active extracellular proteins. optimal pgc <dig> activity was observed at 50Â°c and ph  <dig>  the km and vmax values of purified r-foc1-pgc <dig> were  <dig>  mg.ml- <dig> and  <dig>  units mg protein- <dig> min- <dig>  respectively. the km and vmax values of purified r-foc4-pgc <dig> were  <dig>  mg.ml- <dig> and  <dig>  units mg protein- <dig> min- <dig>  respectively. both recombinant pgc <dig> proteins could induce tissue maceration and necrosis in banana plants.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these results suggest that pgc <dig> is the first exopg reported from the pathogen foc, and we have shown that fully functional pgc <dig> can be produced in the p. pastoris expression system.
