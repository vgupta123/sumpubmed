BACKGROUND
laminitis, the structural failure of interdigitated tissue that suspends the distal skeleton within the hoof capsule, is a devastating disease that is the second leading cause of both lameness and euthanasia in the horse. current transcriptomic research focuses on the expression of known genes. however, as this tissue is quite unique and equine gene annotation is largely derived from computational predictions, there are likely yet uncharacterized transcripts that may be involved in the etiology of laminitis. in order to create a novel annotation resource, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of sagittal lamellar sections from one control and two laminitis affected horses.


RESULTS
whole transcriptome sequencing of the three samples resulted in  <dig> million reads. overall,  <dig> % of the reads mapped to the equcab <dig> reference genome, allowing for the identification of  <dig>  snps. the de novo assembly generated around  <dig>  transcripts, of which  <dig>  corresponded to known annotations. annotated transcript models are hosted in a public data repository and thus can be easily accessed or loaded into genome browsers. rt-pcr of  <dig> selected assemblies confirmed structure and expression in lamellar tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome sequencing represents a powerful tool to expand on equine annotation and identify novel targets for further laminitis research.
