BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic pathogen that can infect a range of animals and humans. ingestion of t. gondii oocysts in soil is a significant transmission route for humans and animals acquiring toxoplasmosis. in the present study, we developed a new semi-nested pcr method to determine t. gondii oocysts distribution in soils in northwestern china.


RESULTS
the one tube semi-nested pcr assay was developed to detect the oocysts of t. gondii in soil, targeting the repetitive 529 bp fragment of t. gondii genomic dna. then a total of  <dig> soil samples, including  <dig> samples from gansu province and  <dig> samples from qinghai province, northwestern china, were examined by the semi-nested pcr method. one third of the positive samples were sequenced. the sensitivity of the semi-nested pcr assay was 102 
t. gondii oocysts in 5 g soil sample. investigation of soil samples from northwestern china showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> soil samples  were t. gondii positive. sequences of the partial 529 bp fragments varied from 0– <dig> % among the sequenced samples. the prevalence of t. gondii oocysts in soil from cities  was slightly higher than that in soils from pasturing areas  . among the different regions in cities, the prevalence of t. gondii oocysts in soils from parks was  <dig> %, whereas that in soils from schools was  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study firstly reported the prevalence of t. gondii oocysts in soils in northwest china using a novel semi-nested pcr assay, which provided baseline data for the effective prevention and control of toxoplasmosis in this region.
