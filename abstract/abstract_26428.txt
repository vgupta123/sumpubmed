BACKGROUND
wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in different stages of mammalian development and implicated in various cancers . recent experimental and computational studies have revealed characteristics of the pathway, however a cell-specific spatial perspective is lacking. in this study, a novel 3d confocal quantitation protocol is developed to acquire spatial  and temporal quantitative data on target protein  concentrations in human epithelial kidney cells  during perturbation . computational models of the wnt pathway are constructed and interrogated based on this data.


RESULTS
a single compartment wnt pathway model is compared with a simple β-catenin two compartment model to investigate wnt3a signaling in hek293t cells. when protein synthesis is inhibited, β-catenin decreases at the same rate in both cellular compartments, suggesting diffusional transport is fast compared to β-catenin degradation in the cytosol. with wnt3a stimulation, the total amount of β-catenin rises throughout the cell, however the increase is initially  faster in the nuclear compartment. while both models were able to reproduce the whole cell changes in β-catenin, only the compartment model reproduced the wnt3a induced changes in β-catenin distribution and it was also the best fit for the data obtained when active transport was included alongside passive diffusion transport.


CONCLUSIONS
this integrated 3d quantitation imaging protocol and computational modeling approach allowed cell-specific compartment models of the signaling pathways to be constructed and analyzed. the wnt models constructed in this study are the first for hek293t and have suggested potential roles of inter-compartment transport to the dynamics of signaling.
