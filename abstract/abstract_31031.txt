BACKGROUND
thellungiella has been proposed as an extremophile alternative to arabidopsis to investigate environmental stress tolerance. however, arabidopsis accessions show large natural variation in their freezing tolerance and here the tolerance ranges of collections of accessions in the two species were compared.


RESULTS
leaf freezing tolerance of  <dig> thellungiella accessions was assessed with an electrolyte leakage assay before and after 14 days of cold acclimation at 4°c. soluble sugars  and free polyamines  were quantified by hplc, proline photometrically. the ranges in nonacclimated freezing tolerance completely overlapped between arabidopsis and thellungiella. after cold acclimation, some thellungiella accessions were more freezing tolerant than any arabidopsis accessions. acclimated freezing tolerance was correlated with sucrose levels in both species, but raffinose accumulation was lower in thellungiella and only correlated with freezing tolerance in arabidopsis. the reverse was true for leaf proline contents. polyamine levels were generally similar between the species. only spermine content was higher in nonacclimated thellungiella plants, but decreased during acclimation and was negatively correlated with freezing tolerance.


CONCLUSIONS
thellungiella is not an extremophile with regard to freezing tolerance, but some accessions significantly expand the range present in arabidopsis. the metabolite data indicate different metabolic adaptation strategies between the species.
