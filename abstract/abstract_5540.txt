BACKGROUND
when orthologous sequences from species distributed throughout an optimal range of divergence times are available, comparative genomics is a powerful tool to address problems such as the identification of the forces that shape gene structure during evolution, although the functional constraints involved may vary in different genes and lineages.


RESULTS
we identified and annotated in the mitocomp <dig> dataset the orthologs of  <dig> nuclear genes controlling oxidative phosphorylation in  <dig> drosophilidae species and in five non-drosophilidae insects, and compared them with each other and with their counterparts in three vertebrates  and in the cnidarian nematostella vectensis, taking into account conservation of gene structure and regulatory motifs, and preservation of gene paralogs in the genome. comparative analysis indicates that the ancestral insect oxphos genes were intron rich and that extensive intron loss and lineage-specific intron gain occurred during evolution. comparison with vertebrates and cnidarians also shows that many oxphos gene introns predate the cnidarian/bilateria evolutionary split. the nuclear respiratory gene element  has played a key role in the evolution of the insect oxphos genes; it is constantly conserved in the oxphos orthologs of all the insect species examined, while their duplicates either completely lack the element or possess only relics of the motif.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations reinforce the notion that the common ancestor of most animal phyla had intron-rich gene, and suggest that changes in the pattern of expression of the gene facilitate the fixation of duplications in the genome and the development of novel genetic functions.
