BACKGROUND
the mce operons play an important role in the entry of m. tuberculosis into macrophages and non-phagocytic cells. their non-redundant function as well as complex regulation is implied by the phenotype of mce mutants. recently, mce <dig> operon was found to extend over  <dig> genes, fadd <dig>  being the first gene of the operon. the presence of a non-coding sequence of  <dig> base pairs between rv <dig> and rv <dig> is peculiar to mce <dig> among the four mce operons of m.tuberculosis. we have examined the function of this region.


RESULTS
we predicted putative promoter activity of the  <dig> base pairs of non-coding, intergenic region between rv <dig> and rv <dig> in silico using meme software and designate it as intergenic promoter, igpr. we demonstrate both promoter activity and a putative negative regulatory function of this fragment by reporter assays carried out in the surrogate host m.smegmatis. we find that the repressive elements not only control the native promoter but also repress a heterologous promoter of m.smegmatis. the higher activity of the intergenic promoter in a clinical isolate in comparison with the wild type sequence from m.tuberculosis h37rv could be correlated with a point mutation within the negative element. we have mapped two transcription start sites for mce <dig> operon both of which are utilized in m.tuberculosis h37rv as well as the clinical isolate vpci <dig>  our studies show that the promoter activity in the non-coding region is relevant not only in reporter gene expression but also in the expression of mce <dig> operon in m. tuberculosis cells grown in synthetic medium.


CONCLUSIONS
the mce operon of m.tuberculosis h37rv potentially can be transcribed from two promoters p <dig> and p <dig>  former mapping upstream of rv <dig> and the latter in the non-coding intergenic region between rv <dig> and rv <dig>  the transcription initiation from p <dig> results in a transcript with rv <dig> while that from p <dig> will be without it. the sequences between the translation start site of rv <dig> and the promoter p <dig> have a negative regulatory role, as point mutation within the sequence leads to enhanced activity of p <dig> as well as a heterologous promoter from m.smegmatis. the mutation detected in the clinical isolate vpci <dig> therefore behaves like a gain-of-function mutation.
