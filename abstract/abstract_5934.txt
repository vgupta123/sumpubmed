BACKGROUND
all shigella flexneri serotypes except serotype  <dig> share a common o-antigen tetrasaccharide backbone and nearly all variations between serotypes are due to glucosyl and/or o-acetyl modifications of the common o unit mediated by glycosyltransferases encoded by serotype-converting bacteriophages. several s. flexneri serotype-converting phages including sfv, sfx, sf <dig> and sfii have been isolated and characterized. however, s. flexneri serotype-converting phage sfi which encodes a type i modification of serotype  <dig>  had not yet been characterized.


RESULTS
the sfi phage was induced and purified from a s. flexneri serotype 1a clinical strain  <dig>  electron microscopy showed that the sfi phage has a hexagonal head and a long contractile tail, characteristic of the members of myoviridae family. sfi can convert serotype y to serotype 1a and serotype x to serotype 1d, but cannot convert  <dig> other s. flexneri serotypes  tested, suggesting that sfi has a narrow host range. similar to other s. flexneri serotype-converting phages, sfi integrates into the trna-thrw gene adjacent to proa of the host chromosome when lysogenized. the complete sequence of the sfi genome was  <dig> Â bp, encoding  <dig> open reading frames and two trna genes. phage sfi shares significant homology with s. flexneri phage sfv, escherichia coli prophage e <dig> and lambda, and is classified into the lambdoid phage family. sfi was found to use a cos mechanism for dna packaging similar to that of phage sfv.


CONCLUSIONS
sfi contains features of lambdoid phages and is closely related to s. flexneri phage sfv, e. coli prophage e <dig> and lambda. the characterization of sfi enhances our understanding of serotype conversion of s. flexneri.
