BACKGROUND
copy number variation is an important dimension of genetic diversity and has implications in development and disease. as an important model organism, the mouse is a prime candidate for copy number variant  characterization, but this has yet to be completed for a large sample size. here we report cnv analysis of publicly available, high-density microarray data files for  <dig> mouse tail samples, including  <dig> mice that had not been characterized for cnvs previously.


RESULTS
we found  <dig> putative autosomal cnvs across the samples affecting  <dig>  % of the mouse reference genome. we find significant differences in the degree of cnv uniqueness  and the nature of cnv-gene overlap between wild-caught mice and classical laboratory strains. cnv-gene overlap was associated with lipid metabolism, pheromone response and olfaction compared to immunity, carbohydrate metabolism and amino-acid metabolism for wild-caught mice and classical laboratory strains, respectively. using two subspecies of wild-caught mus musculus, we identified putative cnvs unique to those subspecies and show this diversity is better captured by wild-derived laboratory strains than by the classical laboratory strains. a total of  <dig> genic copy number variable regions  were selected for experimental confirmation by droplet digital pcr .


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis we present is a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of cnvs in mus musculus, which increases the number of known variants in the species and will accelerate the identification of novel variants in future studies.
