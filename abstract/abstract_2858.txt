BACKGROUND
multiple proteins containing burp domain have been identified in many different plant species, but not in any other organisms. to date, the molecular function of the burp domain is still unknown, and no systematic analysis and expression profiling of the gene family in soybean  has been reported.


RESULTS
in this study, multiple bioinformatics approaches were employed to identify all the members of burp family genes in soybean. a total of  <dig> burp gene types were identified. these genes had diverse structures and were distributed on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis suggested that these burp family genes could be classified into  <dig> subfamilies, and one of which defines a new subfamily, burpv. quantitative real-time pcr  analysis of transcript levels showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes had no expression specificity;  <dig> of them were specifically expressed in some of the tissues; and one of them was not expressed in any of the tissues or organs studied. the results of stress treatments showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> identified burp family genes responded to at least one of the three stress treatments;  <dig> of them were not influenced by stress treatments even though a stress related cis-element was identified in the promoter region. no stress related cis-elements were found in promoter region of any burpv member. however, qrt-pcr results indicated that all members from burpv responded to at least one of the three stress treatments. more significantly, the members from the rd22-like subfamily showed no tissue-specific expression and they all responded to each of the three stress treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and classified all the burp domain-containing genes in soybean. their expression patterns in different tissues and under different stress treatments were detected using qrt-pcr.  <dig> out of  <dig> burp genes in soybean had no tissue-specific expression, while  <dig> out of them were stress-responsive. the data provided an insight into the evolution of the gene family and suggested that many burp family genes may be important for plants responding to stress conditions.
