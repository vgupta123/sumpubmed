BACKGROUND
high-throughput methods can directly detect the set of interacting proteins in model species but the results are often incomplete and exhibit high false positive and false negative rates. a number of researchers have recently presented methods for integrating direct and indirect data for predicting interactions. these methods utilize a common classifier for all pairs. however, due to missing data and high redundancy among the features used, different protein pairs may benefit from different features based on the set of attributes available. in addition, in many cases it is hard to directly determine which of the data sources contributed to a prediction. this information is important for biologists using these predications in the design of new experiments.


RESULTS
to address these challenges we propose a mixture-of-feature-experts method for protein-protein interaction prediction. we split the features into roughly homogeneous sets of feature experts. the individual experts use logistic regression and their scores are combined using another logistic regression. when combining the scores the weighting of each expert depends on the set of input attributes available for that pair. thus, different experts will have different influence on the prediction depending on the available features.


CONCLUSIONS
we applied our method to predict the set of interacting proteins in yeast and human cells. our method improved upon the best previous methods for this task. in addition, the weighting of the experts provides means to evaluate the prediction based on the high scoring features.
