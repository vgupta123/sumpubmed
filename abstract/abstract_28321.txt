BACKGROUND
as the epidemic of mdr-tb and xdr-tb becomes increasingly severe, it is important to determine the clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of mdr-tb and xdr-tb. recently, many studies have shown that clinical features and molecular characteristics of drug-resistant strains vary in different geographical areas, however, further information is needed to assess the dynamic evolution of drug-resistant tb. comparative studies between different time periods are necessary to elucidate the development of drug-resistant tb.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> strains were collected from beijing chest hospital in  <dig> and in  <dig>  respectively. drug-resistance rates and mutations associated with resistance to first-line anti-tuberculosis  drugs were compared. the overall rate of drug resistance among strains of tb in  <dig> was  <dig>  %, significantly higher than that in  <dig> . rates of resistance to each first-line drug  and to second-line drug ofloxacin increased significantly from  <dig> to  <dig>  the overall mdr rate also increased significantly from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the rate of mdr increased significantly between these two time periods in previously treated cases  but not in new cases , and the rate of xdr was similar in new cases at the two time periods, but was marginally higher in  <dig> in previously treated cases . previous treatment was found to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tb, especially for mdr-tb. in addition, the proportion of drug resistant isolates in which katg, the maba-inha promoter, oxyr-ahpc intergenic region, rpob, rpsl, and embb were mutated was similar in  <dig> and  <dig>  however patterns of mutation in these loci were more diverse in  <dig> compared to  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that the prevalence of drug resistant tb remains high in beijing, china, and that increasing rates of resistance in m. tuberculosis to all anti-tb drugs should be considered when choosing an optimal anti-tb regimen. moreover, acquired multi-drug resistance may play a primary role in the mdr-tb epidemic in beijing, china. consequently, this highlights the importance of an earlier start to effective and supervised treatment in order to reduce the burden of retreatment.
