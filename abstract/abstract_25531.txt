BACKGROUND
the identification of charge clusters  in proteins and their mapping within the protein structure sequence is an important step toward a comprehensive analysis of how these particular motifs mediate, via electrostatic interactions, various molecular processes such as protein sorting, translocation, docking, orientation and binding to dna and to other proteins. few algorithms that specifically identify these charge clusters have been designed and described in the literature. in this study,  <dig> distinctive human viral proteomes were screened for the occurrence of charge clusters  using a new computational approach.


RESULTS
three hundred and seventy three cc have been identified within the  <dig> viral protein sequences screened. the number of protein sequences that are cc-free is  <dig>  while  <dig> and  <dig> proteins contained positive charge  and negative charge clusters , respectively. the nccs  were more prevalent than pcc . pcc-containing proteins are significantly longer than those having nccs . the most prevalent virus families having pcc and ncc were herpesviridae followed by papillomaviridae. however, the single-strand rna group has in average three times more ncc than pcc. according to the functional domain classification, a significant difference in distribution was observed between pcc and ncc  with the occurrence of nccs being more frequent in c-terminal region while pcc more often fall within functional domains. only  <dig> proteins sequences contained both ncc and pcc. moreover,  <dig> ncc were conserved in  <dig> proteins while only  <dig> pcc were conserved in  <dig> protein sequences. to understand the mechanism by which the membrane translocation functionalities are embedded in viral proteins, we screened our pcc for sequences corresponding to cell-penetrating peptides  using two online databases: cellppd and cpppred. we found that all our pccs, having length varying from  <dig> to  <dig> amino-acids were predicted as cpps. experimental validation is required to improve our understanding of the role of these pccs in viral infection process.


CONCLUSIONS
screening distinctive cluster charges in viral proteomes suggested a functional role of these protein regions and might provide potential clues to improve the current understanding of viral diseases in order to tailor better preventive and therapeutic approaches.
