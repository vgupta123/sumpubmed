BACKGROUND
vertebrate limb development involves a reciprocal feedback loop between limb mesenchyme and the overlying apical ectodermal ridge . several gene pathways participate in this feedback loop, including fgf signaling. in the forelimb lateral plate mesenchyme, tbx <dig> activates fgf <dig> expression, which in turn initiates and maintains the mesenchyme/aer fgf signaling loop. recent findings have revealed that tbx <dig> transcriptional activity is regulated by dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and interaction with pdlim <dig>  a pdz-lim protein family member, along actin filaments. this tbx <dig> regulation is critical in heart formation, but the coexpression of both proteins in other developing tissues suggests a broader functional role.


RESULTS
knock-down of pdlim <dig> function leads to decreased pectoral fin cell proliferation resulting in a severely stunted fin phenotype. while early gene induction and patterning in the presumptive fin field appear normal, the pectoral fin precursor cells display compaction and migration defects between  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-fertilization . during fin growth fgf <dig> is sequentially expressed in the mesenchyme and then in the apical ectodermal ridge . however, in pdlim <dig> antisense morpholino-treated embryos this switch of expression is prevented and fgf <dig> remains ectopically active in the mesenchymal cells. along with the lack of fgf <dig> in the aer, other critical factors including fgf <dig> are reduced, suggesting signaling problems to the underlying mesenchyme. as a consequence of perturbed aer function in the absence of pdlim <dig>  pathway components in the fin mesenchyme are misregulated or absent, indicating a breakdown of the fgf signaling feedback loop, which is ultimately responsible for the loss of fin outgrowth.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first evidence for the involvement of pdlim <dig> in pectoral fin development. proper fin outgrowth requires fgf <dig> downregulation in the fin mesenchyme with subsequent activation in the aer, and pdlim <dig> appears to regulate this transition, potentially through tbx <dig> regulation. by controlling tbx <dig> subcellular localization and transcriptional activity and possibly additional yet unknown means, pdlim <dig> is required for proper development of the heart and the fins. these new regulatory mechanisms may have important implications how we interpret tbx <dig> function in congenital hand/heart syndromes in humans.
