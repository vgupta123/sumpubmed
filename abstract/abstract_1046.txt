BACKGROUND
a biofilm is a complex community of microorganisms that develop on surfaces in diverse environments. the thickness of the biofilm plays a crucial role in the physiology of the immobilized bacteria. the most cariogenic bacteria, mutans streptococci, are common inhabitants of a dental biofilm community. in this study, dna-microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the thickness of s. mutans biofilms.


RESULTS
comparative transcriptome analyses indicated that expression of  <dig> genes was differentially altered in 400- vs. 100-microns depth and  <dig> genes in 200- vs. 100-microns biofilms. only  <dig> s. mutans genes showed differential expression in both 400- vs. 100-microns and 200- vs. 100-microns biofilms. all of these genes were upregulated.

as sucrose is a predominant factor in oral biofilm development, its influence was evaluated on selected genes expression in the various depths of biofilms. the presence of sucrose did not noticeably change the regulation of these genes in 400- vs. 100-microns and/or 200- vs. 100-microns biofilms tested by real-time rt-pcr.

furthermore, we analyzed the expression profile of selected biofilm thickness associated genes in the luxs- mutant strain. the expression of those genes was not radically changed in the mutant strain compared to wild-type bacteria in planktonic condition. only slight downregulation was recorded in smu.2146c, smu. <dig>  smu. <dig>  and smu. <dig> genes expression in luxs- bacteria in biofilm vs. planktonic environments.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings reveal genes associated with the thickness of biofilms of s. mutans. expression of these genes is apparently not regulated directly by luxs and is not necessarily influenced by the presence of sucrose in the growth media.
