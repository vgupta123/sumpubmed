BACKGROUND
k+ channels are diverse; both in terms of their function and their molecular composition. shal subunits were first described in drosophila. there are three mammalian orthologs, which are members of the kv <dig> subfamily. they are involved in neuronal firing patterns as well as control of the cardiac action potential duration.


RESULTS
here, we report the biophysical and pharmacological characterization of zshal <dig>  which is the ortholog of the mammalian kv <dig>  subunit, which in mammals is involved in action potential repolarization and gives rise to neuronal a-type k+ currents involved in somatodendretic signal integration.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that zshal has similar functional and pharmacological characteristics compared to kv <dig>  and it is similarly regulated by pharmacological agents and by the kv <dig> accessory subunit, ncs- <dig>
