BACKGROUND
two domestic shorthair cats presenting with progressive hind-limb ataxia and increased aggressiveness were necropsied and a post mortem diagnosis of feline spongiform encephalopathy  was made. a wide spectrum of tissue samples was collected and evaluated histologically and immunohistologically for the presence of prpsc.


RESULTS
histopathological examination revealed a diffuse vacuolation of the grey matter neuropil with the following areas being most severely affected: corpus geniculatum medialis, thalamus, gyrus dentatus of the hippocampus, corpus striatum, and deep layers of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex as well as in the brain stem. in addition, a diffuse glial reaction involving astrocytes and microglia and intraneuronal vacuolation in a few neurons in the brain stem was present.

heavy prpsc immunostaining was detected in brain, retina, optic nerve, pars nervosa of the pituitary gland, trigeminal ganglia and small amounts in the myenteric plexus of the small intestine  and slightly in the medulla of the adrenal gland.


CONCLUSIONS
the prpsc distribution within the brain was consistent with that described in other fse-affected cats. the pattern of abnormal prp in the retina corresponded to that found in a captive cheetah with fse, in sheep with scrapie and was similar to nvcjd in humans.
