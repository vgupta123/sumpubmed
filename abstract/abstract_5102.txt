BACKGROUND
although much is understood about the enzymatic cascades that underlie cellular biosynthesis, comparatively little is known about the rules that determine their cellular organization. we performed a detailed analysis of the localization of e.coli gfp-tagged enzymes for cells growing exponentially.


RESULTS
we found that out of  <dig> globular enzymes, at least  <dig> have a discrete punctuate localization in the cytoplasm and catalyze the first or the last reaction in 60% of biosynthetic pathways. a graph-theoretic analysis of e.coli’s metabolic network shows that localized enzymes, in contrast to non-localized ones, form a tree-like hierarchical structure, have a higher within-group connectivity, and are traversed by a higher number of feed-forward and feedback loops than their non-localized counterparts. a gene ontology analysis of these enzymes reveals an enrichment of terms related to essential metabolic functions in growing cells. given that these findings suggest a distinct metabolic role for localization, we studied the dynamics of cellular localization of the cell wall synthesizing enzymes in b. subtilis and found that enzymes localize during exponential growth but not during stationary growth.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that active biochemical pathways inside the cytoplasm are organized spatially following a rule where their first or their last enzymes localize to effectively connect the different active pathways and thus could reflect the activity state of the cell’s metabolic network.
