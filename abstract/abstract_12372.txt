BACKGROUND
previous findings suggested that lactobacillus rhamnosus crl <dig> is able to increase resistance of children to intestinal viral infections. however, the intestinal cells, cytokines and receptors involved in the immunoregulatory effect of this probiotic strain have not been fully characterized.


RESULTS
we aimed to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in the immunomodulatory effect of the crl <dig> strain and therefore evaluated in vitro the crosstalk between l. rhamnosus crl <dig>  porcine intestinal epithelial cells  and antigen presenting cells  from swine peyer’s patches in order to deepen our knowledge about the mechanisms, through which this strain may help preventing viral diarrhoea episodes. l. rhamnosus crl <dig> was able to induce ifn–α and –β in iecs and improve the production of type i ifns in response to poly challenge independently of toll-like receptor - <dig> or tlr <dig> signalling. in addition, the crl <dig> strain induced mrna expression of il- <dig> and tnf-α via tlr <dig> in iecs. furthermore, the strain significantly increased surface molecules expression and cytokine production in intestinal apcs. the improved th <dig> response induced by l. rhamnosus crl <dig> was triggered by tlr <dig> signalling and included augmented expression of mhc-ii and co-stimulatory molecules and expression of il-1β, il- <dig>  and ifn-γ in apcs. il- <dig> was also significantly up-regulated by crl <dig> in apcs.


CONCLUSIONS
it was recently reviewed the emergence of tlr agonists as new ways to transform antiviral treatments by introducing panviral therapeutics with less adverse effects than ifn therapies. the use of l. rhamnosus crl <dig> as modulator of innate immunity and inductor of antiviral type i ifns, ifn-γ, and regulatory il- <dig> clearly offers the potential to overcome this challenge.
