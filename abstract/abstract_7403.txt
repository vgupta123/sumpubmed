BACKGROUND
the possibilities offered by next generation sequencing  platforms are revolutionizing biotechnological laboratories. moreover, the combination of ngs sequencing and affordable high-throughput genotyping technologies is facilitating the rapid discovery and use of snps in non-model species. however, this abundance of sequences and polymorphisms creates new software needs. to fulfill these needs, we have developed a powerful, yet easy-to-use application.


RESULTS
the ngs_backbone software is a parallel pipeline capable of analyzing sanger,  <dig>  illumina and solid  sequence reads. its main supported analyses are: read cleaning, transcriptome assembly and annotation, read mapping and single nucleotide polymorphism  calling and selection. in order to build a truly useful tool, the software development was paired with a laboratory experiment. all public tomato sanger est reads plus  <dig>  million illumina reads were employed to test the tool and predict polymorphism in tomato. the cleaned reads were mapped to the sgn tomato transcriptome obtaining a coverage of  <dig>  for sanger and  <dig>  for illumina.  <dig>  single nucleotide variations  were predicted. a total of  <dig> snvs were experimentally validated, and 85% were found to be real.


CONCLUSIONS
ngs_backbone is a new software package capable of analyzing sequences produced by ngs technologies and predicting snvs with great accuracy. in our tomato example, we created a highly polymorphic collection of snvs that will be a useful resource for tomato researchers and breeders. the software developed along with its documentation is freely available under the agpl license and can be downloaded from http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/ngs_backbone/ or http://github.com/joseblanca/franklin.
