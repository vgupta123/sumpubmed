BACKGROUND
crispr  rnas provide the specificity for noncoding rna-guided adaptive immune defence systems in prokaryotes. crispr arrays consist of repeat sequences separated by specific spacer sequences. crispr arrays have previously been identified in a large proportion of prokaryotic genomes. however, currently available detection algorithms do not utilise recently discovered features regarding crispr loci.


RESULTS
we have developed a new approach to automatically detect, predict and interactively refine crispr arrays. it is available as a web program and command line from bioanalysis.otago.ac.nz/crisprdetect. crisprdetect discovers putative arrays, extends the array by detecting additional variant repeats, corrects the direction of arrays, refines the repeat/spacer boundaries, and annotates different types of sequence variations  in near identical repeats. due to these features, crisprdetect has significant advantages when compared to existing identification tools. as well as further support for small medium and large repeats, crisprdetect identified a class of arrays with ‘extra-large’ repeats in bacteria . the crisprdetect output is integrated with other analysis tools. notably, the predicted spacers can be directly utilised by crisprtarget to predict targets.


CONCLUSIONS
crisprdetect enables more accurate detection of arrays and spacers and its gff output is suitable for inclusion in genome annotation pipelines and visualisation. it has been used to analyse all complete bacterial and archaeal reference genomes.
