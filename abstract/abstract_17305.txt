BACKGROUND
interleukin- <dig>  is a secreted immunoregulatory cytokine critically involved in host protection from parasitic helminths  <cit> . reasoning that helminths may have evolved mechanisms to antagonize il <dig> to maximize their dispersal, we explored mammalian il <dig> evolution.


RESULTS
this analysis revealed evidence of diversifying selection at  <dig> residues, clustered in epitopes responsible for il <dig> binding to its type i and type ii receptors. such a striking signature of selective pressure suggested either recurrent episodes of pathogen antagonism or ligand/receptor co-evolution. to test the latter possibility, we performed detailed functional analysis of il <dig> allotypes expressed by mus musculus musculus and mus musculus castaneus, which happen to differ at  <dig> residues  in and adjacent to the site  <dig> epitope that binds the il4rÎ± subunit shared by the type i and type ii il <dig> receptors. we show that this intra-species variation affects the ability of il <dig> neither to bind il <dig> receptor alpha  nor to signal biological responses through its type i receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
our results -- reminiscent of clustered positively selected sites revealing functionally important residues at host-virus interaction interfaces -- are consistent with il <dig> having evolved to avoid recurrent pathogen antagonism, while maintaining the capacity to bind and signal through its cognate receptor. this work exposes what may be a general feature of evolutionary conflicts fought by pathogen antagonists at host protein-protein interaction interfaces involved in immune signaling: the emergence of receptor-binding ligand epitopes capable of buffering amino acid variation.
