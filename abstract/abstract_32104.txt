BACKGROUND
there is an increasing demand on cholesterol oxidase for its various industrial and clinical applications. the current research was focused on extracellular cholesterol oxidase production under submerged fermentation by a local isolate previously identified as streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig>  the crude enzyme extract was purified by two purification steps, protein precipitation using ammonium sulfate followed by ion exchange chromatography using deae sepharose cl-6b. the kinetic parameters of purified cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig> were studied.


RESULTS
the best conditions for maximum cholesterol oxidase activity were found to be 105 min of incubation time, an initial ph of  <dig> and temperature of 37 °c. the optimum substrate concentration was found to be  <dig>  mm. the higher thermal stability behavior of cholesterol oxidase was at 50 °c. around  <dig> % of the initial activity was retained by the enzyme after 20 min of incubation at 50 °c. the apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme as sized by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacryalamide gel electrophoresis was approximately  <dig> kda. on deae sepharose cl-6b column cholesterol oxidase was purified to homogeneity with final specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg protein and  <dig> -fold enhancement. the amino acid analysis of the purified enzyme produced by streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig> illustrated that, cholesterol oxidase is composed of  <dig> residues with glutamic acid as the most represented amino acid with concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml.


CONCLUSIONS
taking into account the extracellular production, wide ph tolerance, thermal stability and shelf life, cholesterol oxidase produced by streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig> suggested that the enzyme could be industrially useful.
