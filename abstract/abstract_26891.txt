BACKGROUND
unmethylated cytosine-guanine  motif-containing oligodeoxynucleotides  have been well characterized as agonists of toll-like receptor  <dig> . odns with a phosphorothioate  backbone have been studied as tlr <dig> agonists since natural odns with a phosphodiester  backbone are easily degraded by a serum nuclease, which makes them problematic for therapeutic applications. however, odns with a pto backbone have been shown to have undesirable side effects. thus, our goal was to develop nuclease-resistant, pd odns that are effective as human tlr <dig>  agonists.


RESULTS
the sequence of odn <dig>  a cpg odn that acts as an htlr <dig> agonist, was used as the basic cpg odn material. the 3'-end modification of odn <dig> with a pd backbone  improved its potential as an htlr <dig> agonist because of increased resistance to nucleolytic degradation. moreover, 3'-end modification with oligonucleotides showed higher induction than modification with biotin, fitc, and amino groups. further, enhancement of htlr <dig> activity was found to be dependent on the number of cpg core motifs  in the pd odn containing the 3'-end oligonucleotides. in particular, odn sequences consisting of two to three linked odn <dig> sequences with a pd backbone  acted as effective agonists of htlr <dig> even at lower concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that pd-odn2006- <dig> and pd-odn-2006-2006- <dig> can be used as potentially safe agonists for htlr <dig> activation instead of cpg odns with a pto backbone. we propose these cpg odns consisting of only a pd backbone as a novel class of cpg odn.
