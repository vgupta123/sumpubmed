BACKGROUND
congenital cardiovascular diseases are the most common form of birth defects in humans. a substantial portion of these defects has been associated with inappropriate induction, migration, differentiation and patterning of pluripotent cardiac neural crest stem cells. while tgf-β-superfamily signaling has been strongly implicated in neural crest cell development, the detailed molecular signaling mechanisms in vivo are still poorly understood.


RESULTS
we deleted the tgf-β type i receptor alk <dig> specifically in the mouse neural crest cell lineage. failure in signaling via alk <dig> leads to severe cardiovascular and pharyngeal defects, including inappropriate remodeling of pharyngeal arch arteries, abnormal aortic sac development, failure in pharyngeal organ migration and persistent truncus arteriosus. while alk <dig> is not required for neural crest cell migration, our results demonstrate that it plays an important role in the survival of post-migratory cardiac neural crest cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that alk5-mediated signaling in neural crest cells plays an essential cell-autonomous role in the pharyngeal and cardiac outflow tract development.
