BACKGROUND
endo- <dig> -β-mannanase is an enzyme that can catalyze the random hydrolysis of β- <dig>  4-mannosidic linkages in the main chain of mannans, glucomannans and galactomannans and has a number of applications in different biotechnology industries. penicillium oxalicum is a powerful hemicellulase-producing fungus ; however, few previous studies have focused on the cloning and expression of the endo- <dig> -β-mannanase gene from penicillium oxalicum.


RESULTS
a gene encoding an acidophilic thermostable endo- <dig> -β-mannanase  from penicillium oxalicum gz- <dig>  which belongs to glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  was cloned and successfully expressed in pichia pastoris gs <dig>  a high enzyme activity  was detected in the culture supernatant. the recombinant endo- <dig> -β-mannanase  was tagged with 6 × his at its c-terminus and purified using a ni-nta sepharose column to apparent homogeneity. the purified rpoman5a showed a single band on sds-page with a molecular mass of approximately  <dig>  kda. the specific activity of the purified rpoman5a was  <dig>  u mg− <dig> using locust bean gum as substrate. the optimal catalytic temperature  and ph value for rpoman5a are 80°c and ph  <dig> , respectively. the rpoman5a is highly thermostable with a half-life of approximately  <dig> h at 60°c at ph  <dig> . the km and vmax values for locust bean gum, konjac mannan, and guar gum are  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig>   <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig>  and  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> and  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig>  respectively. the enzymatic activity of rpoman5a was not significantly affected by an array of metal ions, but was inhibited by fe3+ and hg2+. analytical results of hydrolytic products showed that rpoman5a could hydrolyze various types of mannan polymers and released various mannose and manno-oligosaccharides, with the main products being mannobiose, mannotriose, and mannopentaose.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that the high-efficient expression and secretion of acid stable and thermostable recombinant endo- <dig>  4-β-mannanase in pichia pastoris is suitable for various biotechnology applications.
