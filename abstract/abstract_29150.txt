BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae , also known as group b streptococcus , is an important pathogen for neonatal pneumonia, meningitis, bovine mastitis, and fish meningoencephalitis. the global outbreaks of streptococcus disease in tilapia cause huge economic losses and threaten human food hygiene safety as well. to investigate the mechanism of s. agalactiae pathogenesis in tilapia and develop attenuated s. agalactiae vaccine, this study sequenced and comparatively analyzed the whole genomes of virulent wild-type s. agalactiae strain hn <dig> and its highly-passaged attenuated strain ym <dig> derived from tilapia.

methods
we performed illumina sequencing of dna prepared from strain hn <dig> and ym <dig>  sequencedreads were assembled and nucleotide comparisons, single nucleotide polymorphism  , indels were analyzed between the draft genomes of hn <dig> and ym <dig>  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  and prophage were detected and analyzed in different s. agalactiae strains.


RESULTS
the genome of s. agalactiae ym <dig> was  <dig> ,957 bp with a gc content of  <dig>  %; it contained  <dig> genes and  <dig> rnas. meanwhile, the genome of s. agalactiae hn <dig> was  <dig> ,722 bp with a gc content of  <dig>  %; it had  <dig> genes and  <dig> rnas. comparative genome analysis indicated that compared with hn <dig>  ym <dig> genome had two significant large deletions, at the sizes of  <dig> and  <dig>  bp respectively, resulting in the deletion of three rrna and ten trna genes, as well as the deletion and functional damage of ten genes related to metabolism, transport, growth, anti-stress, etc. besides these two large deletions, other ten deletions and  <dig> single nucleotide variations  were also identified, mainly affecting the metabolism- and growth-related genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome of attenuated s. agalactiae ym <dig> showed significant variations, resulting in the deletion of  <dig> functional genes, compared to the parental pathogenic strain hn <dig>  the deleted and mutated functional genes all encode metabolism- and growth-related proteins, not the known virulence proteins, indicating that the metabolism- and growth-related genes are important for the pathogenesis of s. agalactiae.
