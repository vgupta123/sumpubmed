BACKGROUND
the greatest challenges in vaccine development include optimization of dna vaccines for use in humans, creation of effective single-dose vaccines, development of delivery systems that do not involve live viruses, and the identification of effective new adjuvants. herein, we describe a novel, simple technique for efficiently vaccinating mice against tuberculosis . our technique consists of a single-dose, genetic vaccine formulation of dna-hsp <dig> complexed with cationic liposomes and administered intranasally.


RESULTS
we developed a novel and non-toxic formulation of cationic liposomes, in which the dna-hsp <dig> vaccine was entrapped  or complexed , and used to immunize mice by intramuscular or intranasal routes. although both liposome formulations induced a typical th <dig> pattern of immune response, the intramuscular route of delivery did not reduce the number of bacilli. however, a single intranasal immunization with comp-hsp <dig>  carrying as few as  <dig> μg of plasmid dna, leads to a remarkable reduction of the amount of bacilli in lungs. these effects were accompanied by increasing levels of ifn-γ and lung parenchyma preservation, results similar to those found in mice vaccinated intramuscularly four times with naked dna-hsp <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
our objective was to overcome the significant obstacles currently facing dna vaccine development. our results in the mouse tb model showed that a single intranasal dose of comp-hsp <dig> elicited a cellular immune response that was as strong as that induced by four intramuscular doses of naked-dna. this formulation allowed a 16-fold reduction in the amount of dna administered. moreover, we demonstrated that this vaccine is safe, biocompatible, stable, and easily manufactured at a low cost. we believe that this strategy can be applied to human vaccines to tb in a single dose or in prime-boost protocols, leading to a tremendous impact on the control of this infectious disease.
