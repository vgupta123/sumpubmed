BACKGROUND
computing accurate nucleic acid melting temperatures has become a crucial step for the efficiency and the optimisation of numerous molecular biology techniques such as in situ hybridization, pcr, antigene targeting, and microarrays. melting is a free open source software which computes the enthalpy, entropy and melting temperature of nucleic acids. melting  <dig>  was able to handle several types of hybridization such as dna/dna, rna/rna, dna/rna and provided corrections to melting temperatures due to the presence of sodium. the program can use either an approximative approach or a more accurate nearest-neighbor approach.


RESULTS
two new versions of the melting software have been released. melting  <dig>  is a direct update of version  <dig> , integrating newly available thermodynamic parameters for inosine, a modified adenine base with an universal base capacity, and incorporates a correction for magnesium. melting  <dig> is a complete reimplementation which allows much greater flexibility and extensibility. it incorporates all the thermodynamic parameters and corrections provided in melting  <dig> x and introduces a large set of thermodynamic formulae and parameters, to facilitate the calculation of melting temperatures for perfectly matching sequences, mismatches, bulge loops, cng repeats, dangling ends, inosines, locked nucleic acids, 2-hydroxyadenines and azobenzenes. it also includes temperature corrections for monovalent ions , magnesium ions and commonly used denaturing agents such as formamide and dmso.


CONCLUSIONS
melting is a useful and very flexible tool for predicting melting temperatures using approximative formulae or nearest-neighbor approaches, where one can select different sets of nearest-neighbor parameters, corrections and formulae. both versions are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/melting/and at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/melting/under the terms of the gpl license.
