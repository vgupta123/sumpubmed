BACKGROUND
the hydrolysis of seaweed polysaccharides is the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion  of seaweeds. seven different microbial inocula and a mixture of these  were therefore compared in triplicate, each grown over four weeks in static culture for the ability to degrade laminaria hyperborea seaweed and produce methane through ad.


RESULTS
all the inocula could degrade l. hyperborea and produce methane to some extent. however, an inoculum of slurry from a human sewage anaerobic digester, one of rumen contents from seaweed-eating north ronaldsay sheep and inoculum  <dig> used most seaweed volatile solids  , suggesting that these each had efficient seaweed polysaccharide digesting bacteria. the human sewage inoculum, an inoculum of anaerobic marine mud mixed with rotting seaweed and inoculum  <dig> all developed to give higher volumes of methane  ,compared to other inocula . inoculum  <dig> also gave the highest acetate production  in a single-stage fermenter ad system and produced most methane  in phase ii of a two-stage ad system.


CONCLUSIONS
overall inoculum  <dig> was found to be the most efficient inoculum for ad of seaweed. the study therefore showed that selection and inclusion of efficient polysaccharide hydrolysing bacteria and methanogenic archaea in an inoculum offer increased methane productivity in ad of l. hyperborea. this inoculum will now being tested in larger scale  continuously stirred reactors optimised for feed rate and retention time to determine maximum methane production under single-stage and two-stage ad systems.
