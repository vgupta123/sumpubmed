BACKGROUND
largely because of their direct, negative impacts on human health, the venoms of front-fanged snakes of the families viperidae and elapidae have been extensively characterized proteomically, transcriptomically, and pharmacologically. however, relatively little is known about the molecular complexity and evolution of the venoms of rear-fanged colubrid snakes, which are, with a few notable exceptions, regarded as harmless to humans. many of these snakes have venoms with major effects on their preferred prey, and their venoms are probably as critical to their survival as those of front-fanged elapids and viperids.


RESULTS
we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptomes from a specimen of hypsiglena  and of boiga irregularis  and verified the transcriptomic results proteomically by means of high-definition mass spectrometry. we identified nearly  <dig>  nontoxin genes for each species. for b. irregularis, we found  <dig> putative toxin transcripts in  <dig> clusters with <1% nucleotide divergence, and for hypsiglena we identified  <dig> toxin sequences that were grouped into  <dig> clusters. comparisons of the venoms revealed divergent venom types, with hypsiglena possessing a viper-like venom dominated by metalloproteinases, and b. irregularis having a more elapid-like venom, consisting primarily of three-finger toxins.


CONCLUSIONS
despite the difficulty of procuring venom from rear-fanged species, we were able to complete all analyses from a single specimen of each species without pooling venom samples or glands, demonstrating the power of high-definition transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. we found a high level of divergence in the venom types of two colubrids. these two venoms reflected the hemorrhagic/neurotoxic venom dichotomy that broadly characterizes the difference in venom strategies between elapids and viperids.
