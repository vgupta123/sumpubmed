BACKGROUND
regulatory t  cells play important roles in autoimmune diseases, cancer, and organ transplantation. forkhead box protein o <dig>  and il-7rα are closely related to the homeostasis of treg cells. however, the mechanism underlying treg proliferation and activation remains unclear. here, we evaluated how the over-expression of foxo <dig> affects treg cell proliferation via intracellular signaling. ntreg cells were transfected separately with foxo <dig> and aven small-interfering rna  or over-expression plasmid. the expression of signaling pathway genes and cd <dig> was confirmed using rt-qpcr and western blot analysis. the expression of cell surface molecules and apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry 3-  <dig> - diphenyltetrazolium bromide for cell proliferation assays.


RESULTS
foxo <dig> strengthened the proliferative ability of treg cells by activating il-7/cd <dig> signaling. in addition, foxo <dig> suppressed treg cell apoptosis by regulating aven expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the results in this study indicated that foxo <dig> is a positive regulatory factor for the proliferation and activity of treg cells. foxo <dig> might be a potential target for the activation of ntreg cells in vivo and in vitro.
