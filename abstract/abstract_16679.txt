BACKGROUND
xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is a basidiomycetous yeast that synthesizes astaxanthin, a carotenoid with great biotechnological impact. the ergosterol and carotenoid synthetic pathways derive from the mevalonate pathway and involve cytochrome p <dig> enzymes. among these enzymes, the cyp <dig> family, which is involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, is one of the most remarkable that has c14-demethylase activity.


RESULTS
in this study, the cyp <dig> gene from x. dendrorhous was isolated and its function was analyzed. the gene is composed of ten exons and encodes a predicted  <dig> amino acid polypeptide that exhibits conserved cytochrome p <dig> structural characteristics and shares significant identity with the sterol c14-demethylase from other fungi. the functionality of this gene was confirmed by heterologous complementation in s. cerevisiae. furthermore, a cyp <dig> gene mutation in x. dendrorhous reduced sterol production by approximately 40% and enhanced total carotenoid production by approximately 90% compared to the wild-type strain after  <dig> and 120 h of culture, respectively. additionally, the cyp <dig> gene mutation in x. dendrorhous increased hmgr  and crtr  transcript levels, which could be associated with reduced ergosterol production.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the cyp <dig> gene identified in x. dendrorhous encodes a functional sterol c14-demethylase that is involved in ergosterol biosynthesis.
