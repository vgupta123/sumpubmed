BACKGROUND
hint proteins are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and belong to the superfamily of hit proteins, which are characterized by an histidine-triad sequence motif. while the eukaryotic variants hydrolyze amp derivates and modulate transcription, the function of prokaryotic hint proteins is less clearly defined. in mycoplasma hominis, hint is concomitantly expressed with the proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  two domains of a surface exposed membrane complex, and in addition interacts with the p <dig> moiety.


RESULTS
an cluster of hitabl genes, similar to that of m. hominis was found in m. pulmonis, m. mycoides subspecies mycoides sc, m. mobile and mesoplasma florum. rt-pcr analyses provided evidence that the p <dig>  p <dig> and hint homologues of m. pulmonis were polycistronically organized, suggesting a genetic and physical interaction between the proteins encoded by these genes in these species. while the hit loci of m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium encoded, in addition to hint, a protein with several transmembrane segments, the hit locus of ureaplasma parvum encoded a pore-forming protein, uu <dig>  a p <dig> homologue, uu <dig>  hint, uu <dig>  and a membrane protein of unknown function, uu <dig>  although a full-length mrna spanning the four genes was not detected, amplification of all intergenic regions from the center of uu <dig> to the end of uu <dig> by rt-pcr may be indicative of a common, but unstable mrna.

in chlamydiaceae the hit gene is flanked upstream by a gene predicted to encode a metal dependent hydrolase and downstream by a gene putatively encoding a protein with arm-repeats, which are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. in rt-pcr analyses of c. pneumoniae, regions comprising only two genes, cp265/cp <dig> and cp266/cp <dig> were able to be amplified. in contrast to this in vivo interaction analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro immune co-precipitation revealed an interaction between cp <dig>  which contains the arm repeats, cp <dig>  the predicted hydrolase, and cp <dig>  the hint protein.


CONCLUSIONS
in the mollicutes hint proteins were shown to be linked with membrane proteins while in the chlamydiaceae they were genetically and physically associated with cytoplasmic proteins, one of which is predicted to be a metal-dependent phosphoesterase. future work will elucidate whether these differing associations indicate that hint proteins have evolved independently or are indeed two hotspots of a common sphere of action of bacterial hint proteins.
