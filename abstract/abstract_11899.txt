BACKGROUND
birds clean and lubricate their feathers with waxes that are produced in the uropygial gland, a holocrine gland located on their back above the tail. the type and the composition of the secreted wax esters are dependent on the bird species, for instance the wax ester secretion of goose contains branched-chain fatty acids and unbranched fatty alcohols, whereas that of barn owl contains fatty acids and alcohols both of which are branched. alcohol-forming fatty acyl-coa reductases  catalyze the reduction of activated acyl groups to fatty alcohols that can be esterified with acyl-coa thioesters forming wax esters.


RESULTS
cdna sequences encoding fatty acyl-coa reductases were cloned from the uropygial glands of barn owl , domestic chicken  and domestic goose . heterologous expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that they encode membrane associated enzymes which catalyze a nadph dependent reduction of acyl-coa thioesters to fatty alcohols. by feeding studies of transgenic yeast cultures and in vitro enzyme assays with membrane fractions of transgenic yeast cells two groups of isozymes with different properties were identified, termed far <dig> and far <dig>  the far <dig> group mainly synthesized 1-hexadecanol and accepted substrates in the range between  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms, whereas the far <dig> group preferred stearoyl-coa and accepted substrates between  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms. expression studies with tissues of domestic chicken indicated that far transcripts were not restricted to the uropygial gland.


CONCLUSIONS
the data of our study suggest that the identified and characterized avian far isozymes, far <dig> and far <dig>  can be involved in wax ester biosynthesis and in other pathways like ether lipid synthesis.
