BACKGROUND
while cortical representations of intrinsic hand muscles have been extensively studied in healthy individuals, little is known about the representation of proximal upper limb muscles. improving our understanding of normal shoulder function is important, given that shoulder musculoskeletal disorders affect approximately 20% of the population and are suspected to involve changes in central motor representations. the purpose of the study is to describe the motor representation  amplitude at the hotspot, map area, normalized map volume and center of gravity) of the infraspinatus muscle in healthy individuals, and to explore the potential influence of hand dominance on this representation , as well as the effect of age and gender on motor excitability.


RESULTS
fifteen healthy participants took part in this study. no significant asymmetry between sides was observed for motor excitability , map area  and normalized map volume . moreover, no side x intensity interaction was found , indicating similar stimulus response properties. no difference between sides was found in the location of infraspinatus motor representation, either in the mediolateral or anteroposterior axis . neither age nor gender influenced amt  or mep size .


CONCLUSIONS
as the cortical representation of infraspinatus muscles was found to be symmetric between sides, both in terms of excitability and location, comparisons between the intact and affected side could be performed in clinical studies, regardless of whether the dominant or non-dominant side is affected. the next step will be to characterize corticospinal excitability and map parameters in populations with shoulder disorders.
