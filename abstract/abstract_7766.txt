BACKGROUND
enterovirus   <dig> is one of the common causative agents for hand, foot, and, mouth disease . in recent years, the virus caused several outbreaks with high numbers of deaths and severe neurological complications. despite the importance of these epidemics, several aspects of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics, including viral nucleotide variations within and between different outbreaks, rates of change in immune-related structural regions vs. non-structural regions, and forces driving the evolution of ev <dig>  are still not clear.


RESULTS
we sequenced four genomic segments, i.e., the 5' untranslated region , vp <dig>  2a, and 3c, of  <dig> ev <dig> viral strains collected from  <dig> to  <dig> in taiwan. the phylogenies derived from different genomic segments revealed different relationships, indicating frequent sequence recombinations as previously noted. in addition to simple recombinations, exchanges of the p <dig> domain between different species/genotypes of human enterovirus species -a were repeatedly observed. contrasting patterns of polymorphisms and divergences were found between structural  and non-structural segments , i.e., the former was less polymorphic within an outbreak but more divergent between different hev-a species than the latter two. our computer simulation demonstrated a significant excess of amino acid replacements in the vp <dig> region implying its possible role in adaptive evolution. between different epidemic seasons, we observed high viral diversity in the epidemic peaks followed by severe reductions in diversity. viruses sampled in successive epidemic seasons were not sister to each other, indicating that the annual outbreaks of ev <dig> were due to genetically distinct lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
based on observations of accelerated amino acid changes and frequent exchanges of the p <dig> domain, we propose that positive selection and subsequent frequent domain shuffling are two important mechanisms for generating new genotypes of hev-a. our viral dynamics analysis suggested that the importation of ev <dig> from surrounding areas likely contributes to local ev <dig> outbreaks.
