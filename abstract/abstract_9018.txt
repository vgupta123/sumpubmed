BACKGROUND
in mammals, eag k+ channels  are exclusively expressed in the brain and comprise two isoforms: eag <dig>  and eag <dig> . despite their wide presence in various regions of the brain, the functional role of eag k+ channels remains obscure. here we address this question by characterizing the subcellular localization of rat eag <dig>  and rat eag <dig>  in hippocampal neurons, as well as determining the structural basis underlying their different localization patterns.


RESULTS
immunofluorescence analysis of young and mature hippocampal neurons in culture revealed that endogenous reag <dig> and reag <dig> k+ channels were present in both the dendrosomatic and the axonal compartments. only reag <dig> channels displayed a punctate immunostaining pattern and showed significant co-localization with psd- <dig>  subcellular fractionation analysis further demonstrated a distinct enrichment of reag <dig> in the synaptosomal fraction. over-expression of recombinant gfp-tagged eag constructs in hippocampal neurons also showed a significant punctate localization of reag <dig> channels. to identify the protein region dictating the eag channel subcellular localization pattern, we generated a variety of different chimeric constructs between reag <dig> and reag <dig>  quantitative studies of neurons over-expressing these gfp-tagged chimeras indicated that punctate localization was conferred by a segment  within the proximal post-cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain  region in the reag <dig> carboxyl terminus.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that eag <dig> and eag <dig> k+ channels may modulate membrane excitability in both the dendrosomatic and the axonal compartments and that eag <dig> may additionally regulate neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic signaling. furthermore, we present the first evidence showing that the proximal post-cnbhd region seems to govern the eag k+ channel subcellular localization pattern.
