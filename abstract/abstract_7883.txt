BACKGROUND
insulin-producing beta cells emerge during pancreas development in two sequential waves. recently described later-forming beta cells in zebrafish show high similarity to second wave mammalian beta cells in developmental capacity. loss-of-function studies in mouse and zebrafish demonstrated that the homeobox transcription factors pdx <dig> and hb <dig> are both critical for pancreas and beta cell development and discrete stage-specific requirements for these genes have been uncovered. previously, exocrine and endocrine cell recovery was shown to follow loss of pdx <dig> in zebrafish, but the progenitor cells and molecular mechanisms responsible have not been clearly defined. in addition, interactions of pdx <dig> and hb <dig> in beta cell formation have not been addressed.


RESULTS
to learn more about endocrine progenitor specification, we examined beta cell formation following morpholino-mediated depletion of pdx <dig> and hb <dig>  we find that after early beta cell reduction, recovery occurs following loss of either pdx <dig> or hb <dig> function. unexpectedly, simultaneous knockdown of both hb <dig> and pdx <dig> leads to virtually complete and persistent beta cell deficiency. we used a neurod:egfp transgenic line to examine endocrine cell behavior in vivo and developed a novel live-imaging technique to document emergence and migration of late-forming endocrine precursors in real time. our data show that notch-responsive progenitors for late-arising endocrine cells are predominantly post mitotic and depend on pdx <dig>  by contrast, early-arising endocrine cells are specified and differentiate independent of pdx <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the nearly complete beta cell deficiency after combined loss of hb <dig> and pdx <dig> suggests functional cooperation, which we clarify as distinct roles in early and late endocrine cell formation. a novel imaging approach permitted visualization of the emergence of late endocrine cells within developing embryos for the first time. we demonstrate a pdx1-dependent progenitor population essential for the formation of duct-associated, second wave endocrine cells. we further reveal an unexpectedly low mitotic activity in these progenitor cells, indicating that they are set aside early in development.
