BACKGROUND
floral transition is a critical event in the life cycle of a flowering plant as it determines its reproductive success. despite extensive studies of specific genes that regulate this process, the global changes in transcript expression profiles at the point when a vegetative meristem transitions into an inflorescence have not been reported. we analyzed gene expression during arabidopsis thaliana meristem development under long day conditions from day  <dig> to  <dig> after germination in one-day increments.


RESULTS
the dynamics of the expression of the main flowering regulators was consistent with previous reports: notably, the expression of flowering locus c  decreased over the course of the time series while expression of leafy  increased. this analysis revealed a developmental time point between  <dig> and 12 days after germination where flc expression had decreased but lfy expression had not yet increased, which was characterized by a peak in the number of differentially expressed genes. gene ontology  enrichment analysis of these genes identified an overrepresentation of genes related to the cell cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered an unprecedented burst of differential expression of cell cycle related genes at one particular point during transition to flowering. we suggest that acceleration of rate of the divisions and partial cell cycling synchronization takes place at this point.
