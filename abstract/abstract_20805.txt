BACKGROUND
high-density map is a valuable tool for genetic and genomic analysis. although wax gourd is a widely distributed vegetable of cucurbitaceae and has important medicinal and health value, no genetic map has been constructed because of the lack of efficient markers. specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing  is a newly developed high-throughput strategy for large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery and genotyping.


RESULTS
in our present study, we constructed a high-density genetic map by using slaf-seq and identified a locus controlling pericarp color in wax gourd. an f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals and their two parents were subjected to slaf-seq. a total of  <dig>  m pair-end reads were generated. the average sequencing depth was  <dig>  in the maternal line ,  <dig>  in the parental line , and  <dig>  in each f <dig> individual. when filtering low-depth slaf tags, a total of  <dig>  high-quality slafs were detected, and  <dig>  of them were polymorphic, with a polymorphism rate of  <dig>  %. and finally,  <dig>  of the polymorphic markers were selected for genetic map construction, and  <dig> linkage groups  were generated. the map spanned  <dig> .86 cm with an average distance between adjacent markers for  <dig>  cm. the inheritance of pericarp color was also studied, which showed that the pericarp color was controlled by one single gene. and based on the newly constructed high-density map, a single locus locating on chromosome  <dig> was identified for controlling the pericarp color of wax gourd.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of high-density genetic map construction and gene mapping in wax gourd, which will be served as an invaluable tool for gene mapping, marker assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning, comparative mapping and draft genome assembling of wax gourd.
