BACKGROUND
dopaminergic pathways that influence mood and behaviour are severely affected in cerebral hypoxia. in contrast, hypoxia promotes the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons. in order to clarify the hypoxic sensitivity of key dopaminergic genes, we aimed to study their transcriptional regulation in the context of neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines exposed to 1% hypoxia.


RESULTS
quantitative rt-pcr assays revealed that the transcription of both type d <dig> and d <dig> postsynaptic dopamine receptors  was induced several fold upon 2-day hypoxia in a cell-specific manner, while the vascular endothelial growth factor gene was activated after 3-hr incubation in hypoxia. on the other hand, mrna levels of type  <dig> dopamine receptor, dopamine transporter, monoamino oxidase and catechol-o-methyltransferase were unaltered, while those of the dopamine receptor regulating factor  were decreased by hypoxia. notably, 2-day hypoxia did not result in elevation of protein levels of drd <dig> and drd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in light of the relatively delayed transcriptional activation of the drd <dig> and drd <dig> genes, we propose that slow-reacting hypoxia sensitive transcription factors might be involved in the transactivation of drd <dig> and drd <dig> promoters in hypoxia.
