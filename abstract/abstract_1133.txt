BACKGROUND
streptomyces species are widely distributed in natural habitats, such as soils, lakes, plants and some extreme environments. replication loci of several streptomyces theta-type plasmids have been reported, but are not characterized in details. conjugation loci of some streptomyces rolling-circle-type plasmids are identified and mechanism of conjugal transferring are described.


RESULTS
we report the detection of a widely distributed streptomyces strain y <dig> and its indigenous plasmid pwty <dig> from fourteen plants and four soil samples cross china by both culturing and nonculturing methods. the complete nucleotide sequence of pwty <dig> consisted of  <dig>  bp. a basic locus for plasmid replication comprised repab genes and an adjacent iteron sequence, to a long inverted-repeat  of which the repa protein bound specifically in vitro, suggesting that repa may recognize a second structure  of the iteron dna. a plasmid containing the locus propagated in linear mode when the telomeres of a linear plasmid were attached, indicating a bi-directional replication mode for pwty <dig>  as for rolling-circle plasmids, a single traa gene and a clt sequence  on pwty <dig> were required for plasmid transfer. traa recognized and bound specifically to the two regions of the clt sequence, one containing all the four dc <dig> of  <dig> bp  and one dc <dig>  and most of ic <dig>  and another covering two dc <dig> and part of ic <dig>  suggesting formation of a high-ordered dna-protein complex.


CONCLUSIONS
this work  isolates a widespread streptomyces strain y <dig> and sequences its indigenous theta-type plasmid pwty27;  identifies the replication and conjugation loci of pwty <dig> and;  characterizes the binding sequences of the repa and traa proteins.
