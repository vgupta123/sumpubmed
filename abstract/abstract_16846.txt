BACKGROUND
the soluble guanylyl cyclase  is a heterodimeric enzyme that, upon activation by nitric oxide, stimulates the production of the second messenger cgmp. each sgc subunit harbor four domains three of which are used for heterodimerization: h-noxa/h-noba domain, coiled-coil domain , and catalytic guanylyl cyclase domain. the cc domain has previously been postulated to be part of a larger cc family termed the signaling helix  family. homodimers of sgc have also been observed but are not functionally active yet are likely transient awaiting their intended heterodimeric partner.


RESULTS
to investigate the structure of the cc s-helix region, we crystallized and determined the structure of the cc domain of the sgcβ <dig> subunit comprising residues 348- <dig>  the crystal structure was refined to  <dig>  Å resolution.


CONCLUSIONS
the cc structure of sgcβ <dig> revealed a tetrameric arrangement comprised of a dimer of cc dimers. each monomer is comprised of a long a-helix, a turn near residue p <dig>  and a short second a-helix. the cc structure also offers insights as to how sgc homodimers are not as stable as  active heterodimers via a possible role for inter-helix salt-bridge formation. the structure also yielded insights into the residues involved in dimerization. in addition, the cc region is also known to harbor a number of congenital and man-made mutations in both membrane and soluble guanylyl cyclases and those function-affecting mutations have been mapped onto the cc structure. this mutant analysis indicated an importance for not only certain dimerization residue positions, but also an important role for other faces of the cc dimer which might perhaps interact with adjacent domains. our results also extend beyond guanylyl cyclases as the cc structure is, to our knowledge, the first s-helix structure and serves as a model for all s-helix containing family members.
