BACKGROUND
berberine is a natural alkaloid derived from a traditional chinese herbal medicine. it is known to modulate microrna  levels, although the mechanism for this action is unknown. here, we previously demonstrate that the expression of  <dig> mirnas is differentially affected by berberine in multiple myeloma cells. among  <dig> mirnas that are down-regulated, nine act as oncomirs, including mir- <dig>  integrative analysis showed that  <dig> of the down-regulated mirnas participate in tumor protein p <dig>  signaling and other cancer pathways. mir- <dig> is involved in all these pathways, and is one of the most important oncomirs to be affected by berberine in multiple myeloma cells.


RESULTS
we confirmed that berberine down-regulated mirna- <dig> expression and significantly up-regulated the expression of programmed cell death  <dig> , a predicted mir- <dig> target. luciferase reporter assays confirmed that pdcd <dig> was directly regulated by mir- <dig>  bioinformatic analysis revealed that the mir- <dig> promoter can be targeted by signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> . down-regulation of interleukin  <dig>  by berberine might lead to inhibition of mir- <dig> transcription through stat <dig> down-regulation in multiple myeloma. furthermore, both berberine and seed-targeting anti-mir- <dig> oligonucleotide induced apoptosis, g2-phase cell cycle arrest and colony inhibition in multiple myeloma cell lines. depletion of pdcd <dig> by short interfering rna could rescue berberine-induced cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that berberine suppresses multiple myeloma cell growth, at least in part, by down-regulating mir- <dig> levels possibly through il6/stat <dig>  this led to increased pdcd <dig> expression, which is likely to result in suppression of the p <dig> signaling pathway. these findings may also provide new mechanistic insight into the anti-cancer effects of certain compounds in traditional chinese herbal medicines.
