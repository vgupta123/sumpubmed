BACKGROUND
mapk-activated protein kinase  <dig>  plays a pivotal role in the cell response to  stress. among others, mk <dig> is known to be involved in the regulation of cytokine mrna metabolism and regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. previously, mk2-deficient mice were shown to be highly resistant to lps/d-galactosamine-induced hepatitis. additionally, research in various disease models has indicated the kinase as an interesting inhibitory drug target for various acute or chronic inflammatory diseases.


RESULTS
we show that in striking contrast to the known resistance of mk2-deficient mice to a challenge with lps/d-gal, a low dose of tumor necrosis factor  causes hyperacute mortality via an oxidative stress driven mechanism. we identified in vivo defects in the stress fiber response in endothelial cells, which could have resulted in reduced resistance of the endothelial barrier to deal with exposure to oxidative stress. in addition, mk2-deficient mice were found to be more sensitive to cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis.


CONCLUSIONS
the capacity of the endothelial barrier to deal with inflammatory and oxidative stress is imperative to allow a regulated immune response and maintain endothelial barrier integrity. our results indicate that, considering the central role of tnf in pro-inflammatory signaling, therapeutic strategies examining pharmacological inhibition of mk <dig> should take potentially dangerous side effects at the level of endothelial barrier integrity into account.
