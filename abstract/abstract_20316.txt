BACKGROUND
for improved uptake of oligonucleotide-based therapy, the oligonucleotides often are coupled to peptides that facilitate entry into cells. to this end, novel cell-penetrating peptides  were designed for mediating intracellular uptake of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. the novel peptides were based on taking advantage of the nuclear localization properties of transcription factors in combination with a peptide that would bind putatively to cell surfaces. it was observed that adding a glutamate peptide to the n-terminus of the nuclear localization signal  of the oct <dig> transcription factor resulted in a novel cpp with better uptake and better nuclear colocalization than any other peptide tested.


RESULTS
uptake of the novel peptide glu-oct <dig> by cancer cell lines was rapid , complete , concentration-dependent, temperature-dependent, and inhibited by sodium azide . substitution of phe, tyr, or asn moieties for the glutamate portion of the novel peptide resulted in abrogation of novel cpp uptake; however none of the substituted peptides inhibited uptake of the novel cpp when coincubated with cells. live-cell imaging and analysis by imaging flow cytometry revealed that the novel cpp accumulated in nuclei. finally, the novel cpp was coupled to a carboxyfluorescein-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide, to see if the peptide could ferry a therapeutic payload into cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies document the creation of a novel cpp consisting of a glutamate peptide coupled to the n-terminus of the oct <dig> nls; the novel cpp exhibited nuclear colocalization as well as uptake by prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines.
