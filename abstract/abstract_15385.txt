BACKGROUND
integrins comprise a large family of α,β heterodimeric, transmembrane cell adhesion receptors that mediate diverse essential biological functions. higher vertebrates possess a single β <dig> gene, and the β <dig> subunit associates with a large number of α subunits to form the major class of extracellular matrix  receptors. despite the fact that the zebrafish  is a rapidly emerging model organism of choice for developmental biology and for models of human disease, little is currently known about β <dig> integrin sequences and functions in this organism.


RESULTS
using rt-pcr, complete coding sequences of zebrafish β <dig> paralogs were obtained from zebrafish embryos or adult tissues. the results show that zebrafish possess two β <dig> paralogs  that have a high degree of identity to other vertebrate β <dig> subunits. in addition, a third, more divergent, β <dig> paralog is present , which may have altered ligand-binding properties. zebrafish also have other divergent β1-like transcripts, which are c-terminally truncated forms lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. together with β1– <dig> these truncated forms comprise a novel group of β <dig> paralogs, all of which have a mutation in the admidas cation-binding site. phylogenetic and genomic analyses indicate that the duplication that gave rise to β1– <dig> and β1– <dig> occurred after the divergence of the tetrapod and fish lineages, while a subsequent duplication of the ancestor of β1– <dig> may have given rise to β1– <dig> and an ancestral truncated paralog. a very recent tandem duplication of the truncated β <dig> paralogs appears to have taken place. the different zebrafish β <dig> paralogs have varied patterns of temporal expression during development. β1– <dig> and β1– <dig> are ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues, whereas the other β <dig> paralogs generally show more restricted patterns of expression.


CONCLUSIONS
zebrafish have a large set of integrin β <dig> paralogs. β1– <dig> and β1– <dig> may share the roles of the solitary β <dig> subunit found in other vertebrates, whereas β1– <dig> and the truncated β <dig> paralogs may have acquired novel functions.
