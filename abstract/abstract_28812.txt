BACKGROUND
developing brain is highly susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic injury leading to severe neurological disabilities in surviving infants and children. previously we reported induction of neuronal pentraxin  <dig>  in hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal brain and np <dig> co-localization with the excitatory ampa receptors glur <dig> at the synaptic sites. however, how np <dig> contributes to hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury is not completely understood.


RESULTS
here we report that extracellular secretion of np <dig> is required for ischemic neuronal death. primary cortical neurons at days in vitro   <dig> were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation , an in vitro model of ischemic stroke, for different time periods . oxygen glucose deprivation showed characteristic morphological changes of dying cells, ogd time-dependent induction of np <dig>  and increased neuronal death. in contrast, the np1-ko cortical neurons were healthy and showed no sign of dying cells under similar conditions. np1gene silencing by np1-specific small interfering rna  protected cortical neurons from ogd-induced death. conditioned media  collected from ogd exposed wt cortical cultures caused neurotoxicity when added to a subset of div  <dig> normoxia control wt cortical cultures. in contrast, cm from ogd-exposed np1-ko cultures did not induce cell toxicity in control wt cultures, suggesting a role for extracellular np <dig> in neuronal death. however, np1-ko neurons, which showed normal neuronal morphology and protection against ogd, sustained enhanced death following incubation with cm from wt ogd-exposed cultures. western blot analysis of ogd exposed wt cm showed temporal increase of np <dig> protein levels in the cm. most strikingly, in contrast to np1-ko cm, incubation of normal cortical cultures with cm from ogd exposed np2-ko cultures showed neurotoxicity similar to that observed with cm from ogd exposed wt neuronal cultures. western immunoblotting further confirmed the increased presence of np <dig> protein in ogd-exposed np2-ko cm. live immunofluorescence analysis show intense cell surface clustering of np <dig> with ampa glur <dig> receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results demonstrate that extracellular release of np <dig> promote hypoxic-ischemic neuronal death possibly via surface clustering with glur <dig> at synaptic sites and that np <dig>  not its family member np <dig>  is involved in the neuronal death mechanisms.
