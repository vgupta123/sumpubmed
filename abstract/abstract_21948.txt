BACKGROUND
red coloration of fruit skin is one of the most important traits in peach , and it is mainly due to the accumulation of anthocyanins. three myb <dig> genes, ppmyb <dig> , ppmyb <dig> , and ppmyb <dig> , have been reported as important regulators of red coloration and anthocyanin biosynthesis in peach fruit. in this study, contribution of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> to anthocyanin accumulation in the fruit skin was investigated in the japanese peach cultivars, white-skinned ‘mochizuki’ and red-skinned ‘akatsuki’. we then investigated the relationships between allelic type of ppmyb <dig>  and skin color phenotype in  <dig> japanese peach cultivars for future establishment of dna-marker.


RESULTS
during the fruit development of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’, anthocyanin accumulation was observed only in the skin of red ‘akatsuki’ fruit in the late ripening stages concomitant with high mrna levels of the last step gene leading to anthocyanin accumulation, udp-glucose:flavonoid-3-o-glucosyltransferase . this was also correlated with the expression level of ppmyb <dig> . unlike ppmyb <dig> , expression levels of ppmyb <dig> / <dig> were low in the skin of both ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ throughout fruit development. moreover, only ppmyb <dig>  revealed expression levels associated with total anthocyanin accumulation in the leaves and flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’. introduction of ppmyb <dig>  into tobacco increased the expression of tobacco ufgt, resulting in higher anthocyanin accumulation and deeper red transgenic tobacco flowers; however, overexpression of ppmyb <dig> / <dig> did not alter anthocyanin content and color of transgenic tobacco flowers when compared with wild-type flowers. dual-luciferase assay showed that the co-infiltration of ppmyb <dig>  with ppbhlh <dig> significantly increased the activity of ppufgt promoter. we also found close relationships of two ppmyb <dig>  allelic types, myb <dig> -1/myb <dig> - <dig>  with the intensity of red skin coloration.


CONCLUSIONS
we showed that ppmyb <dig>  is a major regulator of anthocyanin accumulation in red-skinned peach and that it activates ppufgt transcription. ppmyb <dig> / <dig> may be involved in functions other than anthocyanin accumulation in peach. the peach cultivars having two myb <dig> - <dig> types resulted in the white skin color. by contrast, those with two myb <dig> - <dig> or myb <dig> -1/myb <dig> - <dig> types showed respective red or pale red skin color. these findings contribute to clarifying the molecular mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation and generating gene-based markers linked to skin color phenotypes.
