BACKGROUND
excitotoxicity  is a central process in widespread neurodegenerative conditions such as brain ischemia and chronic neurological diseases. many mechanisms have been suggested to mediate excitotoxicity, but their significance across diverse excitotoxic scenarios remains unclear. death associated protein kinase , a critical molecular switch that controls a range of key signaling and cell death pathways, has been suggested to have an important role in excitotoxicity. however, the molecular mechanism by which dapk exerts its effect is controversial. a few distinct mechanisms have been suggested by single  studies, and a larger array of potential mechanisms is implicated by the extensive interactome of dapk.


RESULTS
here we analyze a well-characterized model of excitotoxicity in the nematode c. elegans to show that dapk is an important mediator of excitotoxic neurodegeneration across a large evolutionary distance. we further show that some proposed mechanisms of dapk’s action  do not have a major role in nematode excitotoxicity. in contrast, pin1/pinn- <dig>  suppresses neurodegeneration in our excitotoxicity model.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies highlight the prominence of dapk and pin1/pinn- <dig> as conserved mediators of cell death processes in diverse scenarios of neurodegeneration.
