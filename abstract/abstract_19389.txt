BACKGROUND
human b lymphocytes can produce leukotriene b <dig> but the biological function of the 5-lipoxygenase  pathway in b cells is unclear. in order to better understand and define the role of 5-lo in b cells, we investigated the expression of 5-lo mrna and protein in subsets of b cells from human tonsils and different types of b cell lymphoma.


RESULTS
based on rt-pcr and western blot/immunohistochemical staining, with a polyclonal antibody raised against 5-lo, high expression of 5-lo was found in mantle zone b cells from tonsils. by contrast, only a weak expression of 5-lo was detected in germinal centre cells and no expression in plasma cells from tonsils. this pattern of 5-lo expression was preserved in malignant lymphoma with high expression in mantle b cell lymphoma  and weak or no expression in follicular lymphoma. primary leukemized mcl, so called b-prolymphocytic leukaemia cells, and mcl cell lines also expressed 5-lo and readily produced ltb <dig> after activation.


CONCLUSIONS
the present report demonstrates the expression of 5-lo mainly in normal and malignant mantle zone b cells while the expression is low or absent in germinal centre b cells and plasma cells, indicating a role of the 5-lo pathway in b cells before the cells finally differentiate to plasma cells.
