BACKGROUND
iodine deficiency and iodine excess are both associated with adverse health consequences. iodine deficiency during pregnancy leads to insufficient maternal thyroid hormone, subsequently causing irreversible adverse effects on the neurological and cognitive functions of the offspring. the results of our previous epidemiological study suggested that mild iodine excess might increase the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism. in the present study, female wistar rats maintained on low-iodine grain were randomly assigned to three groups based on iodated water concentration: low iodine , normal iodine , and 3-fold high iodine . the present study investigated whether higher-than-normal iodine intake  by rats from before pregnancy until breastfeeding affects the postnatal  neurodevelopment  of their offspring during particularly sensitive periods in brain development.


RESULTS
after 12â€‰weeks of treatment , iodine concentrations in urine and thyroid tissue and circulating thyroxine of adult females correlated with iodine intake. brain-derived neurotrophic factor  expression in the hippocampi of pups on pn <dig> and pn <dig> was decreased in 3hi group compared to the ni controls  on pn <dig> and pn <dig>  the bdnf levels of the 3hi pups were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, that of the ni pups. in addition, the 3hi group had a higher neuroendocrine-specific protein a  level than the ni controls on pn <dig> . nsp-a levels of the 3hi pups were  <dig> % that of the ni pups. no significant difference was observed in the expressions of c-fos or c-jun in the hippocampal ca <dig> region of the 3hi group compared to the controls . results from the morris water maze test revealed that pups of the 3hi group had mild learning and spatial memory deficits.


CONCLUSIONS
the neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits of the 3hi pups were mild and temporary, likely related to the changes in hippocampal protein expressions of bdnf and nsp-a.
