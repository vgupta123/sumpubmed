BACKGROUND
transcriptomes are powerful resources, providing a window on the expressed portion of the genome that can be generated rapidly and at low cost for virtually any organism. however, because many genes have tissue-specific expression patterns, developing a complete transcriptome usually requires a 'discovery pool' of individuals to be sacrificed in order to harvest mrna from as many different types of tissue as possible. this hinders transcriptome development in large, charismatic and endangered species, many of which stand the most to gain from such approaches. to circumvent this problem in a model pinniped species, we  <dig> sequenced cdna from testis, heart, spleen, intestine, kidney and lung tissues obtained from nine adult male antarctic fur seals  that died of natural causes at bird island, south georgia.


RESULTS
after applying stringent quality control criteria based on length and annotation, we obtained  <dig>  contigs which, in combination with  <dig> data previously obtained from skin, gave a total of  <dig>  unique contigs. homology was found to  <dig> % of dog  transcripts, suggesting that the combined assembly represents a substantial proportion of this species' transcriptome. moreover, only  <dig> % of transcripts revealed sequence similarity to bacteria, implying minimal contamination, and the percentage of transcripts involved in cell death was low at  <dig> %. transcripts with immune-related annotations were almost five-fold enriched relative to skin and represented  <dig> % of all spleen-specific contigs. by reference to the dog, we also identified transcripts revealing homology to five class i, ten class ii and three class iii genes of the major histocompatibility complex and derived the putative genomic distribution of  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  in silico mined microsatellites and  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that transcriptome development based on samples collected post mortem may greatly facilitate genomic studies, not only of marine mammals but also more generally of species that are of conservation concern.
