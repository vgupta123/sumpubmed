BACKGROUND
the microsporidia parasite nosema contributes to the steep global decline of honey bees that are critical pollinators of food crops. there are two species of nosema that have been found to infect honey bees, nosema apis and n. ceranae. genome sequencing of n. apis and comparative genome analysis with n. ceranae, a fully sequenced microsporidia species, reveal novel insights into host-parasite interactions underlying the parasite infections.


RESULTS
we applied the whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach to sequence and assemble the genome of n. apis which has an estimated size of  <dig>  mbp. we predicted  <dig>  protein- coding genes and predicted the function of each putative protein using the gene ontology. the comparative genomic analysis led to identification of  <dig>  orthologs that are conserved between the two nosema species and genes that are unique characteristics of the individual species, thereby providing a list of virulence factors and new genetic tools for studying host-parasite interactions. we also identified a highly abundant motif in the upstream promoter regions of n. apis genes. this motif is also conserved in n. ceranae and other microsporidia species and likely plays a role in gene regulation across the microsporidia.


CONCLUSIONS
the availability of the n. apis genome sequence is a significant addition to the rapidly expanding body of microsprodian genomic data which has been improving our understanding of eukaryotic genome diversity and evolution in a broad sense. the predicted virulent genes and transcriptional regulatory elements are potential targets for innovative therapeutics to break down the life cycle of the parasite.
