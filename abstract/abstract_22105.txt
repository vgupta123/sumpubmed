BACKGROUND
the interaction between a transcription factor and dna motif  is an important regulatory step in gene regulation. comprehensive genome-wide methods have been developed to characterize protein-dna interactions. recently, the universal protein binding microarray  was introduced to determine if a dna motif interacts with proteins in a genome-wide manner.


RESULTS
we facilitated the pbm technology using a dsred fluorescent protein and a concatenated sequence of oligonucleotides. the pbm was designed in such a way that target probes were synthesized as quadruples of all possible 9-mer combinations, permitting unequivocal interpretation of the cis-acting elements. the complimentary dna strands of the features were synthesized with a primer and dna polymerase on microarray slides. proteins were labeled via n-terminal fusion with dsred fluorescent protein, which circumvents the need for a multi-step incubation. the pbm presented herein confirmed the well-known dna binding sequences of cbf <dig> and cbf1/dreb1b, and it was also applied to elucidate the unidentified cis-acting element of the osnac <dig> rice transcription factor.


CONCLUSIONS
our method demonstrated pbm can be conveniently performed by adopting:  quadruple 9-mers may increase protein-dna binding interactions in the microarray, and  a one-step incubation shortens the wash and hybridization steps. this technology will facilitate greater understanding of genome-wide interactions between proteins and dna.
