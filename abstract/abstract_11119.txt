BACKGROUND
the functional annotation of most genes in newly sequenced genomes is inferred from similarity to previously characterized sequences, an annotation strategy that often leads to erroneous assignments. we have performed a reannotation of  <dig> genomes using an updated version of eficaz, a highly precise method for enzyme function prediction.


RESULTS
based on our three-field ec number predictions, we have obtained lower-bound estimates for the average enzyme content in archaea , bacteria  and eukarya . most annotations added in kegg from  <dig> to  <dig> agree with eficaz predictions made in  <dig>  the coverage of eficaz predictions is significantly higher than that of kegg, especially for eukaryotes. thousands of our novel predictions correspond to hypothetical proteins. we have identified a subset of  <dig> hypothetical proteins with low sequence identity to eficaz training enzymes, whose biochemical functions have been recently characterized and find that in 96%  of the cases we correctly identified their three-field  ec numbers. for two of the  <dig> hypothetical proteins: pa <dig> from pseudomonas aeruginosa, an alginate lyase  and rv <dig> of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, an adp-ribose diphosphatase , we have detected annotation lag of more than two years in databases. two examples are presented where eficaz predictions act as hypothesis generators for understanding the functional roles of hypothetical proteins: flj <dig>  a human protein overexpressed in cancer that eficaz identifies as an endopolyphosphatase , and mw <dig>  a protein of staphylococcus aureus strain mw <dig> that we propose as candidate virulence factor based on its eficaz predicted activity, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase .


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that we have generated enzyme function annotations of high precision and recall. these predictions can be mined and correlated with other information sources to generate biologically significant hypotheses and can be useful for comparative genome analysis and automated metabolic pathway reconstruction.
