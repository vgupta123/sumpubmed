BACKGROUND
cassava  is the basic source for dietary energy of  <dig> million people in the world. in brazil, erinnyis ello ello  is a major pest of cassava crops and a bottleneck for its production. in the 1980s, a naturally occurring baculovirus was isolated from e. ello larva and successfully applied as a bio-pesticide in the field. here, we described the structure, the complete genome sequence, and the phylogenetic relationships of the first sphingid-infecting betabaculovirus.


RESULTS
the baculovirus isolated from the cassava hornworm cadavers is a betabaculovirus designated erinnyis ello granulovirus . the  <dig>  bp long genome has a g + c content of  <dig> %. we found  <dig> putative orfs coding for polypeptides of at least  <dig> amino acid residues. only eight genes were found to be unique. erelgv is closely related to chocgv and piragv isolates. we did not find typical homologous regions and cathepsin and chitinase homologous genes are lacked. the presence of he <dig> and p <dig> homologous genes suggests horizontal gene transfer from alphabaculovirus. moreover, we found a nucleotide metabolism-related gene and two genes that could be acquired probably from densovirus.


CONCLUSIONS
the erelgv represents a new virus species from the genus betabaculovirus and is the closest relative of chocgv. it contains a dutpase-like, a he65-like, p43-like genes, which are also found in several other alpha- and betabaculovirus genomes, and two densovirus-related genes. importantly, recombination events between insect viruses from unrelated families and genera might drive baculovirus genomic evolution.
