BACKGROUND
the genome of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans contains more than  <dig> putative globin genes that all are transcribed. although their translated amino acid sequences fit the globin fold, a variety of amino-acid substitutions and extensions generate a wide structural diversity among the putative globins. no information is available on the physicochemical properties and the in vivo expression.


RESULTS
we expressed the globins in a bacterial system, characterized the purified proteins by optical and resonance raman spectroscopy, measured the kinetics and equilibria of o <dig> binding and determined the crystal structure of glb-1* . furthermore, we studied the expression patterns of glb- <dig>  and glb- <dig>  in the worms using green fluorescent protein technology and measured alterations of their transcript abundances under hypoxic conditions.glb-1* displays the classical three-over-three Î±-helical sandwich of vertebrate globins, assembled in a homodimer associated through facing e- and f-helices. within the heme pocket the dioxygen molecule is stabilized by a hydrogen bonded network including tyrb <dig> and glne <dig> glb- <dig> exhibits high ligand affinity, which is, however, lower than in other globins with the same distal tyrb10-glne <dig> amino-acid pair. in the absence of external ligands, the heme ferrous iron of glb- <dig> is strongly hexacoordinated with hise <dig>  which could explain its extremely low affinity for co. this globin oxidizes instantly to the ferric form in the presence of oxygen and is therefore incapable of reversible oxygen binding.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented data indicate that glb- <dig> and glb- <dig> belong to two functionally-different globin classes.
