BACKGROUND
two novel avipoxviruses from south africa have been sequenced, one from a feral pigeon   and the other from an african penguin  . we present a purpose-designed bioinformatics pipeline for analysis of next generation sequence data of avian poxviruses and compare the different avipoxviruses sequenced to date with specific emphasis on their evolution and gene content.


RESULTS
the fep <dig>  and pepv  genomes encode  <dig> and  <dig> open reading frames respectively and are more closely related to one another  than to either fowlpox virus   or canarypox virus  . overall, fep <dig>  pepv and fwpv have syntenic gene arrangements; however, major differences exist throughout their genomes. the most striking difference between fep <dig> and the fwpv-like avipoxviruses is a large deletion of ~ <dig> kbp from the central region of the genome of fep <dig> deleting a cc-chemokine-like gene, two variola virus b22r orthologues, an n1r/p28-like gene and a v-type ig domain family gene. fep <dig> and pepv both encode orthologues of vaccinia virus c7l and interleukin  <dig>  pepv contains a  <dig> amino acid long orthologue of ubiquitin sharing 97% amino acid identity to human ubiquitin.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome sequences of fep <dig> and pepv have greatly added to the limited repository of genomic information available for the avipoxvirus genus. in the comparison of fep <dig> and pepv to existing sequences, fwpv and cnpv, we have established insights into african avipoxvirus evolution. our data supports the independent evolution of these south african avipoxviruses from a common ancestral virus to fwpv and cnpv.
