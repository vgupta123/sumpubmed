BACKGROUND
eukaryotic transcription activators normally consist of a sequence-specific dna-binding domain  and a transcription activation domain . while many sequence patterns and motifs have been defined for dbds, ads do not share easily recognizable motifs or structures.


RESULTS
we report herein that the n-terminal domain of yeast valyl-trna synthetase can function as an ad when fused to a dna-binding protein, lexa, and turn on reporter genes with distinct lexa-responsive promoters. the transcriptional activity was mainly attributed to a five-residue peptide, wydww, near the c-terminus of the n domain. remarkably, the pentapeptide per se retained much of the transcriptional activity. mutations which substituted tryptophan residues for both of the non-tryptophan residues in the pentapeptide  significantly enhanced its activity , while mutations which substituted aromatic residues with alanine residues severely impaired its activity. accordingly, a much more active peptide, pentatryptophan , was produced, which elicited ~3-fold higher activity than that of the native pentapeptide and the n domain. further study indicated that w <dig> mediates transcription activation through interacting with the general transcription factor, tfiib.


CONCLUSIONS
since w <dig> shares no sequence homology or features with any known transcription activators, it may represent a novel class of ad.
