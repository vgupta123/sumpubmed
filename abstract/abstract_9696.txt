BACKGROUND
recent rodent and human studies provide evidence in support of the fact that cd <dig>  well known as bone marrow stromal cell antigen- <dig>  and a risk factor in parkinson’s disease, also meaningfully acts in the brain as a neuroregulator and affects social behaviors. it has been shown that social behaviors are impaired in cd <dig> knockout mice without severe motor dysfunction and that cd157/bst <dig> gene single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with autism spectrum disorder in humans. however, it is still necessary to determine how this molecule contributes to the brain’s physiological and pathophysiological functions.

methods
to gain fresh insights about the relationship between the presence of cd <dig> in the brain and its enzymatic activity, and aberrant social behavior, cd <dig> knockout mice of various ages were tested.


RESULTS
cd <dig> immunoreactivity colocalized with nestin-positive cells and elements in the ventricular zones in e <dig> embryos. brain cd <dig> mrna levels were high in neonates but low in adults. weak but distinct immunoreactivity was detected in several areas in the adult brain, including the amygdala. cd <dig> has little or no base exchange activity, but some adp-ribosyl cyclase activity, indicating that cd <dig> formed cyclic adp-ribose but much less nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, with both mobilizing ca2+ from intracellular ca2+ pools. social avoidance in cd <dig> knockout mice was rescued by a single intraperitoneal injection of oxytocin.


CONCLUSIONS
cd <dig> may play a role in the embryonic and adult nervous systems. the functional features of cd <dig> can be explained in part through the production of cyclic adp-ribose rather than nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate. further experiments are required to elucidate how the embryonic expression of cd <dig> in neural stem cells contributes to behaviors in adults or to psychiatric symptoms.
