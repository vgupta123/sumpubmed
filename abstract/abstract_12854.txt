BACKGROUND
dna duplex sequences that can be targets for triplex formation are highly over-represented in the human genome, especially in regulatory regions.


RESULTS
here we studied using bioinformatics tools several properties of triplex target sequences in an attempt to determine those that make these sequences so special in the genome.


CONCLUSIONS
our results strongly suggest that the unique physical properties of these sequences make them particularly suitable as "separators" between protein-recognition sites in the promoter region.
