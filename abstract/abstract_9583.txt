BACKGROUND
the enhancer  of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus  of the channel catfish  has been well characterized. the functional core region consists of two variant oct transcription factor binding octamer motifs and one e-protein binding μe <dig> site. an orthologue to the oct <dig> transcription factor has previously been cloned in catfish and is a functionally active transcription factor. this study was undertaken to clone and characterize the oct <dig> transcription factor, which has also been shown to be important in driving immunoglobulin gene transcription in mammals.


RESULTS
an orthologue of oct <dig>  a pou family transcription factor, was cloned from a catfish macrophage cdna library. the inferred amino acid sequence of the catfish oct <dig>  when aligned with other vertebrate oct <dig> sequences, revealed clear conservation of structure, with the pou specific subdomain of catfish oct <dig> showing 96% identity to that of mouse oct <dig>  expression of oct <dig> was observed in clonal t and b cell lines and in all tissues examined. catfish oct <dig>  when transfected into both mammalian  and catfish b cell lines, unexpectedly failed to drive transcription from three different octamer-containing reporter constructs. these contained a trimer of octamer motifs, a fish vh promoter, and the core region of the catfish eμ3' igh enhancer, respectively. this failure of catfish oct <dig> to drive transcription was not rescued by human bob. <dig>  a co-activator of oct transcription factors that stimulates transcription driven by catfish oct <dig>  when co-transfected with catfish oct <dig>  oct <dig> reduced oct <dig> driven transcriptional activation. electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that catfish oct <dig>  bound both consensus and variant octamer motifs. putative n- and c-terminal activation domains of oct <dig>  when fused to a gal <dig> dna binding domain and co-transfected with gal4-dependent reporter constructs were transcriptionally inactive, which may be due in part to a lack of residues associated with activation domain function.


CONCLUSIONS
an orthologue to mammalian oct <dig> has been found in the catfish. it is similar to mammalian oct <dig> in structure and expression. however, these results indicate that the physiological functions of catfish oct <dig> differ from those of mammalian oct <dig> and include negative regulation of transcription.
