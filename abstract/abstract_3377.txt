BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a type of non-coding small rna ~ <dig> nucleotides in length that regulate the expression of protein coding genes at the post-transcriptional level. glycolytic and oxidative myofibers, the two main types of skeletal muscles, play important roles in metabolic health as well as in meat quality and production in the pig industry. previous expression profile studies of different skeletal muscle types have focused on these aspects of mrna and proteins; nonetheless, an explanation of the mirna transcriptome differences between these two distinct muscles types is long overdue.


RESULTS
herein, we present a comprehensive analysis of mirna expression profiling between the porcine longissimus doris muscle  and psoas major muscle  using a deep sequencing approach. we generated a total of  <dig>  m  and  <dig>  m  counts, which produced  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m mappable sequences, respectively, and identified  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirna*s. of  <dig> unique mirnas,  <dig>  were co-expressed, of which  <dig> showed significant differences  between the two muscle types. muscle-specific mir-1-3p showed high expression levels in both libraries , and mirnas that potentially affect metabolic pathways  showed significant differences between the two libraries, indicating that the two skeletal muscle types shared mainly muscle-specific mirnas but expressed at distinct levels according to their metabolic needs. in addition, an analysis of the gene ontology  terms and kegg pathway associated with the predicted target genes of the differentially expressed mirnas revealed that the target protein coding genes of highly expressed mirnas are mainly involved in skeletal muscle structural development, regeneration, cell cycle progression, and the regulation of cell motility.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that mirnas play essential roles in the phenotypic variations observed in different muscle fiber types.
