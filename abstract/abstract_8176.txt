BACKGROUND
like humans, the living elephants are unusual among mammals in being sparsely covered with hair. relative to extant elephants, the extinct woolly mammoth, mammuthus primigenius, had a dense hair cover and extremely long hair, which likely were adaptations to its subarctic habitat. the fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  gene affects hair length in a diverse set of mammalian species. mutations in fgf <dig> lead to recessive long hair phenotypes in mice, dogs, and cats; and the gene has been implicated in hair length variation in rabbits. thus, fgf <dig> represents a leading candidate gene for the phenotypic differences in hair length notable between extant elephants and the woolly mammoth. we therefore sequenced the three exons  and a portion of the promoter of fgf <dig> from the living elephantid species  and, using protocols for ancient dna, from a woolly mammoth.


RESULTS
between the extant elephants and the mammoth, two single base substitutions were observed in fgf <dig>  neither of which alters the amino acid sequence. modeling of the protein structure suggests that the elephantid proteins fold similarly to the human fgf <dig> protein. bioinformatics analyses and dna sequencing of another locus that has been implicated in hair cover in humans, type i hair keratin pseudogene , also yielded negative results. interestingly, krthap <dig> is a pseudogene in elephantids as in humans .


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest that the coding sequence of the fgf <dig> gene is not the critical determinant of hair length differences among elephantids. the results are discussed in the context of hairlessness among mammals and in terms of the potential impact of large body size, subarctic conditions, and an aquatic ancestor on hair cover in the proboscidea.
