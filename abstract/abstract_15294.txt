BACKGROUND
rna interference coupled with videorecording of c. elegans embryos is a powerful method for identifying genes involved in cell division processes. here we present a functional analysis of the gene b <dig> , previously identified as a candidate cell polarity gene in an rnai videorecording screen of chromosome i embryonic lethal genes.


RESULTS
whereas weak rnai inhibition of b <dig>  causes embryonic cell polarity defects, strong inhibition causes embryos to arrest in metaphase of meiosis i. the range of defects induced by rnai of b <dig>  is strikingly similar to those displayed by mutants of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome  components. although similarity searches did not reveal any obvious homologue of b <dig>  in the non-redundant protein database, we found that the n-terminus shares a conserved sequence pattern with the n-terminus of the small budding yeast apc/c subunit cdc <dig> and its orthologues from a variety of other organisms. furthermore, we show that b <dig>  robustly complements the temperature-sensitive growth defect of a yeast cdc26Î” mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate that b <dig>  encodes the c. elegans apc/c subunit cdc- <dig>
