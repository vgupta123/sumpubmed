BACKGROUND
in addition to acting as an rna quality control pathway, nonsense-mediated mrna decay  plays roles in regulating normal gene expression. in particular, the extent to which alternative splicing is coupled to nmd and the roles of nmd in regulating uorf containing transcripts have been a matter of debate. 


RESULTS
in order to achieve a greater understanding of nmd regulated gene expression we used 2d-dige proteomics technology to examine the changes in protein expression induced in hela cells by upf <dig> knockdown. qpcr based validation of the corresponding mrnas, in response to both upf <dig> knockdown and cycloheximide treatment, identified  <dig> bona fide nmd targets. most of these were associated with bioinformatically predicted nmd activating features, predominantly upstream open reading frames . strikingly, however, the majority of transcripts up-regulated by upf <dig> knockdown were either insensitive to, or even down-regulated by, cycloheximide treatment. furthermore, the mrna abundance of several down-regulated proteins failed to change upon upf <dig> knockdown, indicating that upf1's role in regulating mrna and protein abundance is more complex than previously appreciated. among the bona fide nmd targets, we identified a highly conserved as-nmd event within the 3' utr of the hnrnpa2b <dig> gene. overexpression of gfp tagged hnrnp a <dig> resulted in a decrease in endogenous hnrnp a <dig> and b <dig> mrna with a concurrent increase in the nmd sensitive isoforms.


CONCLUSIONS
despite the large number of changes in protein expression upon upf <dig> knockdown, a relatively small fraction of them can be directly attributed to the action of nmd on the corresponding mrna. from amongst these we have identified a conserved as-nmd event within hnrnpa2b <dig> that appears to mediate autoregulation of hnrnpa2b <dig> expression levels.
