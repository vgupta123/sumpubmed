BACKGROUND
constraint-based analysis has become a widely used method to study metabolic networks. while some of the associated algorithms can be applied to genome-scale network reconstructions with several thousands of reactions, others are limited to small or medium-sized models. in  <dig>  erdrich et al. introduced a method called networkreducer, which reduces large metabolic networks to smaller subnetworks, while preserving a set of biological requirements that can be specified by the user. already in  <dig>  burgard et al. developed a mixed-integer linear programming  approach for computing minimal reaction sets under a given growth requirement.


RESULTS
here we present an milp approach for computing minimum subnetworks with the given properties. the minimality  is not guaranteed by networkreducer, while the method by burgard et al. does not allow specifying the different biological requirements. our procedure is about 5- <dig> times faster than networkreducer and can enumerate all minimum subnetworks in case there exist several ones. this allows identifying common reactions that are present in all subnetworks, and reactions appearing in alternative pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
applying complex analysis methods to genome-scale metabolic networks is often not possible in practice. thus it may become necessary to reduce the size of the network while keeping important functionalities. we propose a milp solution to this problem. compared to previous work, our approach is more efficient and allows computing not only one, but even all minimum subnetworks satisfying the required properties.
