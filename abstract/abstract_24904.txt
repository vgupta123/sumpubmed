BACKGROUND
bacterial virulence enhancement and drug resistance are major threats to public health worldwide. interestingly, newly acquired genomic islands  from horizontal transfer between different bacteria strains were found in vibrio cholerae, streptococcus suis, and mycobacterium tuberculosis, which caused outbreak of epidemic diseases in recently years.


RESULTS
using a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> complete genomes from all available bacteria  and archaea , we found that newly acquired gis are often anchored around switch sites of gc-skew . after calculating correlations between relative genomic distances of genomic islands to sgcss and the evolutionary distances of the genomic islands themselves, we found that newly acquired genomic islands are closer to sgcss than the old ones, indicating that regions around sgcss are hotspots for genomic island insertion.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our results, we believe that genomic regions near sgcss are hotspots for horizontal transfer of genomic islands, which may significantly affect key properties of epidemic disease-causing pathogens, such as virulence and adaption to new environments.
