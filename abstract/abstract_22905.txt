BACKGROUND
there is an imperative necessity for alternative sources of energy able to reduce the world dependence of fossil oil. one of the most successful options is ethanol obtained mainly from sugarcane and corn fermentation. the foremost residue from sugarcane industry is the bagasse, a rich lignocellulosic raw material uses for the production of ethanol second generation . new cellulolytic and hemicellulytic enzymes are needed, in order to optimize the degradation of bagasse and production of ethanol 2g.


RESULTS
the ability to produce hemicellulases and related enzymes, suitable for lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction, was explored using  <dig> endophytic fungi and  <dig> fungi isolated from spoiled books in brazil. two initial selections were performed, one employing the esculin gel diffusion assay, and the other by culturing on agar plate media with beechwood xylan and liquor from the hydrothermal pretreatment of sugar cane bagasse. a total of  <dig> isolates were then grown at 29°c on steam-exploded delignified sugar cane bagasse  plus soybean bran  , with measurement of the xylanase, pectinase, β-glucosidase, cmcase, and fpase activities. twelve strains were selected, and their enzyme extracts were assessed using different substrates. finally, the best six strains were grown under xylan and pectin, and several glycohydrolases activities were also assessed. these strains were identified morphologically and by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer  regions and the partial β-tubulin gene . the best six strains were identified as aspergillus niger dr <dig>  trichoderma atroviride dr <dig> and dr <dig>  alternaria sp. dr <dig>  annulohypoxylon stigyum dr <dig> and talaromyces wortmannii dr <dig>  these strains produced glycohydrolases with different profiles, and production was highly influenced by the carbon sources in the media.


CONCLUSIONS
the selected endophytic fungi aspergillus niger dr <dig>  trichoderma atroviride dr <dig> and dr <dig>  alternaria sp. dr <dig>  annulohypoxylon stigyum dr <dig> and talaromyces wortmannii dr <dig> are excellent producers of hydrolytic enzymes to be used as part of blends to decompose sugarcane biomass at industrial level.
