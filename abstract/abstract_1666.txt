BACKGROUND
the bhlh transcription factor twist <dig> plays a key role in the embryonic development and in tumorigenesis. some loss-of-function mutations of the twist <dig> gene have been shown to cause an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis, known as the saethre-chotzen syndrome . although the functional impacts of many twist <dig> mutations have been experimentally reported, little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying their loss-of-function. in a previous study, we highlighted the predictive value of in silico molecular dynamics  simulations in deciphering the molecular function of twist <dig> residues.


RESULTS
here, since the substitution of the arginine  <dig> amino acid by a glycine residue  is responsible for the scs phenotype and the substitution of arginine  <dig> by a proline experimentally decreases the dimerizing ability of twist <dig>  we investigated the molecular impact of this point mutation using md approaches. consistently, md simulations highlighted a clear decrease in the stability of the α-helix during the dimerization of the mutated r154p twist1/e <dig> dimer compared to the wild-type te complex, which was further confirmed in vitro using immunoassays.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that md simulations provide a structural explanation for the loss-of-function associated with the scs twist <dig> mutation and provides a proof of concept of the predictive value of these md simulations. this in silico methodology could be used to determine reliable pharmacophore sites, leading to the application of docking approaches in order to identify specific inhibitors of twist <dig> complexes.
