BACKGROUND
among the cereal crops, barley is the species with the greatest adaptability to a wide range of environments. to determine the level and structure of genetic diversity in barley  landraces from the central highlands of ethiopia, we have examined the molecular variation at seven nuclear microsatellite loci.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> landrace populations were sampled in the two growing seasons , across three districts , and within each district along an altitudinal gradient . overall, although significant, the divergence  is very low between seasons and geographical districts, while it is high between different classes of altitude. selection for adaptation to different altitudes appears to be the main factor that has determined the observed clinal variation, along with population-size effects.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that barley landraces from ethiopia are constituted by highly variable local populations  that have large within-population diversity. these landraces are also shown to be locally adapted, with the major driving force that has shaped their population structure being consistent with selection for adaptation along an altitudinal gradient. overall, our study highlights the potential of such landraces as a source of useful alleles. furthermore, these landraces also represent an ideal system to study the processes of adaptation and for the identification of genes and genomic regions that have adaptive roles in crop species.
