BACKGROUND
acute kidney injury in mammals, which is caused by cardiovascular diseases or the administration of antibiotics with nephrotoxic side-effects is a life-threatening disease, since loss of nephrons is irreversible in mammals. in contrast, fish are able to generate new nephrons even in adulthood and thus provide a good model to study renal tubular regeneration.


RESULTS
here, we investigated the early response after gentamicin-induced renal injury, using the short-lived killifish nothobranchius furzeri. a set of micrornas was differentially expressed after renal damage, among them mir- <dig>  which was up-regulated. a locked nucleic acid-modified antimir- <dig> efficiently knocked down mir- <dig> activity and caused a lag in the proliferative response, enhanced apoptosis and an overall delay in regeneration. transcriptome profiling identified apoptosis as a process that was significantly affected upon antimir- <dig> administration. together with functional data this suggests that mir- <dig> acts as a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic factor in the context of kidney regeneration in fish. possible downstream candidate genes that mediate its effect on proliferation and apoptosis include igfbp <dig> and fosl <dig>  among other genes.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings extend the role of mir- <dig> in the kidney. for the first time we show its functional involvement in regeneration indicating that fast proliferation and reduced apoptosis are important for efficient renal tubular regeneration.
