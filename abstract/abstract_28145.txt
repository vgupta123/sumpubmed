BACKGROUND
two cytidine analogues, gemcitabine and cytosine arabinoside , are widely used in the treatment of a variety of cancers with a large individual variation in response. to identify potential genetic biomarkers associated with response to these two drugs, we used a human lymphoblastoid cell line  model system with extensive genomic data, including  <dig>  million snps and  <dig>  basal expression probesets to perform genome-wide association studies  with gemcitabine and arac ic <dig> values.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> and  <dig> snp loci significantly associated with gemcitabine and arac ic <dig> values, respectively. eleven candidate genes were functionally validated using sirna knockdown approach in multiple cancer cell lines. we also characterized the potential mechanisms of genes by determining their influence on the activity of  <dig> cancer-related signaling pathways using reporter gene assays. most snps regulated gene expression in a trans manner, except  <dig> snps in the pigb gene that were significantly associated with both the expression of pigb and gemcitabine cytotoxicity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that genetic variation might contribute to drug response via either cis- or trans- regulation of gene expression. gwas analysis followed by functional pharmacogenomics studies might help identify novel biomarkers contributing to variation in response to these two drugs and enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms of drug action.
