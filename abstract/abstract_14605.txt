BACKGROUND
adam <dig> is a member of the adam gene family and is mainly expressed in the nervous system. it is thought to be an adhesion molecule, since it has a disintegrin-like domain related to cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. to elucidate the physiological functions of adam <dig>  we generated adam11-deficient mice by means of gene targeting.


RESULTS
adam11-deficient mice were apparently normal, and survived more than one year with no major histological abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord. because adam <dig> is highly expressed in the hippocampus and cerebellum, we have examined adam <dig> mutant mice for learning using visual and hidden water maze tasks, and their motor coordination using a rotating rod task. our results showed that their visual water maze task results are normal, but the hidden water maze and rotating rod task skills are impaired in adam11-deficient mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that adam <dig> mutation does not affect cell migration and differentiation during development, but affects learning and motor coordination. thus, adam <dig> might play an important signalling or structural role as a cell adhesion molecule at the synapse, and may thus participate in synaptic regulation underlying behavioural changes.
