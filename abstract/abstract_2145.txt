BACKGROUND
recent increases in the number of deposited membrane protein crystal structures necessitate the use of automated computational tools to position them within the lipid bilayer. identifying the correct orientation allows us to study the complex relationship between sequence, structure and the lipid environment, which is otherwise challenging to investigate using experimental techniques due to the difficulty in crystallising membrane proteins embedded within intact membranes.


RESULTS
we have developed a knowledge-based membrane potential, calculated by the statistical analysis of transmembrane protein structures, coupled with a combination of genetic and direct search algorithms, and demonstrate its use in positioning proteins in membranes, refinement of membrane protein models and in decoy discrimination.


CONCLUSIONS
our method is able to quickly and accurately orientate both alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins within the lipid bilayer, showing closer agreement with experimentally determined values than existing approaches. we also demonstrate both consistent and significant refinement of membrane protein models and the effective discrimination between native and decoy structures. source code is available under an open source license from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/memembed/.
