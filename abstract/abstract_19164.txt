BACKGROUND
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  is a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plant development, and it catalyses the deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, leading to the production of secondary metabolites. this enzyme has been identified in many organisms, ranging from prokaryotes to higher plants. because nelumbo nucifera is a basal dicot rich in many secondary metabolites, it is a suitable candidate for research on the phenylpropanoid pathway.


RESULTS
three pal members, nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig>  have been identified in n. nucifera using genome-wide analysis. nnpal <dig> contains two introns; however, both nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> have only one intron. molecular and evolutionary analysis of nnpal <dig> confirms that it is an ancient pal member of the angiosperms and may have a different origin. however, pal clusters, except nnpal <dig>  are monophyletic after the split between dicots and monocots. these observations suggest that duplication events remain an important occurrence in the evolution of the pal gene family. molecular assays demonstrate that the mrna of the nnpal <dig> gene is 2343 bp in size and encodes a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide. the optimal ph and temperature of the recombinant nnpal <dig> protein are  <dig>  and 55°c, respectively. the nnpal <dig> protein retains both pal and weak tal catalytic activities with km values of  <dig>  mm for l-phenylalanine and  <dig>  mm for l-tyrosine, respectively. cis-elements response to environmental stress are identified and confirmed using real-time pcr for treatments with abscisic acid , indoleacetic acid , ultraviolet light, neurospora crassa  and drought.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the angiosperm pal genes are not derived from a single gene in an ancestral angiosperm genome; therefore, there may be another ancestral duplication and vertical inheritance from the gymnosperms. the different evolutionary histories for pal genes in angiosperms suggest different mechanisms of functional regulation. the expression patterns of nnpal <dig> in response to stress may be necessary for the survival of n. nucifera since the cretaceous period. the discovery and characterisation of the ancient nnpal <dig> help to elucidate pal evolution in angiosperms.
