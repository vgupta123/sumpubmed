BACKGROUND
in plants, eif4e translation initiation factors and their eifiso4e isoforms are essential susceptibility factors for many rna viruses, including potyviruses. mutations altering these factors are a major source of resistance to the viruses. the eif4e allelic series is associated with specific resistance spectra in crops such as capsicum annum. genetic evidence shows that potyviruses have a specific requirement for a given 4e isoform that depends on the host plant. for example, tobacco etch virus  uses eif4e <dig> to infect capsicum annuum but uses eifiso4e to infect arabidopsis thaliana. here, we investigated how tev exploits different translation initiation factor isoforms to infect these two plant species.


RESULTS
a complementation system was set up in arabidopsis to test the restoration of systemic infection by tev. using this system, arabidopsis susceptibility to tev was complemented with a susceptible pepper eif4e <dig> allele but not with a resistant allele. therefore, in arabidopsis, tev can use the pepper eif4e <dig> instead of the endogenous eifiso4e isoform so is able to switch between translation initiation factor 4e isoform to infect the same host. moreover, we show that overexpressing the pepper eif4e <dig> alleles is sufficient to make arabidopsis susceptible to an otherwise incompatible tev strain. lastly, we show that the resistant eif4e <dig> allele is similarly overcome by a resistance-breaking tev strain as in pepper, confirming that this arabidopsis tev-susceptibility complementation system is allele-specific.


CONCLUSIONS
we report here a complementation system in arabidopsis that makes it possible to assess the role of pepper pvr2-eif4e alleles in susceptibility to tev. heterologous complementation experiments showed that the idiosyncratic properties of the 4e and iso4e proteins create a major checkpoint for viral infection of different hosts. this system could be used to screen natural or induced eif4e alleles to find and study alleles of interest for plant breeding.
