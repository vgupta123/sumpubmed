BACKGROUND
tilapia is the common name for a group of cichlid fishes and is one of the most important aquacultured freshwater food fish. mozambique tilapia and its hybrids, including red tilapia are main representatives of salt tolerant tilapias. a linkage map is an essential framework for mapping qtl for important traits, positional cloning of genes and understanding of genome evolution.


RESULTS
we constructed a consensus linkage map of mozambique tilapia and red tilapia using  <dig> individuals from two f <dig> families and  <dig> microsatellites including  <dig> est-derived markers. in addition, we conducted comparative mapping and searched for sex-determining loci on the whole genome. these  <dig> microsatellites were assigned to  <dig> linkage groups. the map spanned  <dig>  cm with an average inter-marker distance of  <dig>  cm. comparative mapping between tilapia and stickleback, medaka, pufferfish and zebrafish revealed clear homologous relationships between chromosomes from different species. we found evidence for the fusion of two sets of two independent chromosomes forming two new chromosome pairs, leading to a reduction of  <dig> chromosome pairs in their ancestor to  <dig> pairs in tilapias. the xy sex determination locus in mozambique tilapia was mapped on lg <dig>  and verified in five families containing  <dig> individuals. the major xy sex determination locus in red tilapia was located on lg <dig>  and verified in two families containing  <dig> individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
a first-generation linkage map of salt tolerant tilapia was constructed using  <dig> microsatellites. two separate fusions of two sets of two independent chromosomes may lead to a reduction of  <dig> chromosome pairs in their ancestor to  <dig> pairs in tilapias. the xy sex-determining loci from mozambique tilapia and red tilapia were mapped on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively. this map provides a useful resource for qtl mapping for important traits and comparative genome studies. the dna markers linked to the sex-determining loci could be used in the selection of yy males for breeding all-male populations of salt tolerant tilapia, as well as in studies on mechanisms of sex determination in fish.
