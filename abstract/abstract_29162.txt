BACKGROUND
the main two sorts of automatic gene annotation frameworks are ab initio and alignment-based, the latter splitting into two sub-groups. the first group is used for intra-species alignments, among which are successful ones with high specificity and speed. the other group contains more sensitive methods which are usually applied in aligning inter-species sequences.


RESULTS
here we present a new algorithm called cat . it is designed to align mrna sequences to mammalian-sized genomes. cat is implemented using c scripts and is freely available on the web at .


CONCLUSIONS
examined from different angles, cat outperforms other extant alignment tools. tested against all available mouse-human and zebrafish-human orthologs, we demonstrate that cat combines the specificity and speed of the best intra-species algorithms, like blat and sim <dig>  with the sensitivity of the best inter-species tools, like genewise.
