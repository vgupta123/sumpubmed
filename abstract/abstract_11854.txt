BACKGROUND
septoria tritici blotch is an important leaf disease of european winter wheat. in our survey, we analyzed septoria tritici blotch resistance in field trials with a large population of  <dig>  elite hybrids and their  <dig> parental lines. entries were fingerprinted with the 9 k snp array. the accuracy of prediction of septoria tritici blotch resistance achieved with different genome-wide mapping approaches was evaluated based on robust cross validation scenarios.


RESULTS
septoria tritici blotch disease severities were normally distributed, with genotypic variation being significantly  larger than zero. the cross validation study revealed an absence of large effect qtl for additive and dominance effects. application of genomic selection approaches particularly designed to tackle complex agronomic traits allowed to double the accuracy of prediction of septoria tritici blotch resistance compared to calculation methods suited to detect qtl with large effects.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that septoria tritici blotch resistance in european winter wheat is controlled by multiple loci with small effect size. this suggests that the currently achieved level of resistance in this collection is likely to be durable, as involvement of a high number of genes in a resistance trait reduces the risk of the resistance to be overcome by specific pathogen isolates or races.
