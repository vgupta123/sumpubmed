BACKGROUND
abundant experimental data have implicated an important role for insulin-like growth factor  in protecting neuronal cells from injury, including hypoxia/ischemia  injury, a major cause of neuron death. while the specific interaction of igfs with neuronal or glial type  <dig> igf receptors  has been shown to be essential to igf actions during development, the same has not been directly demonstrated following h/i injury. to directly examine the role of neuronal igf1r following h/i injury, we utilized conditional mutant nes-igf1r-/wt mice and determined the impact of igf1r haplodeficiency specifically in nestin-expressing neuronal precursors and their progeny on h/i-induced neuronal damage and apoptosis in hippocampus.


RESULTS
h/i induced significant damage to the cerebral hemisphere and hippocampus ipsilateral to the ligated right common carotid artery both in control and nes-igf1r-/wt mice at postnatal day  <dig>  blunting igf1r expression, however, markedly exacerbated h/i-induced damage and appeared to increase mortality. in the ipsilateral hemisphere and hippocampus, nes-igf1r-/wt mice had infarct areas double the size of those in controls. the size of the ipsilateral hemisphere and hippocampus in nes-igf1r-/wt mice were 15% to 17% larger than those in controls, reflecting more severe edema. consistent with its effects on infarct area, igf1r haplodeficiency causes a greater decrease in neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus of nes-igf1r-/wt mice. the reduction in neurons was largely due to increases in neuronal apoptosis. judged by pyknotic nuclei, tunel and caspase- <dig> labeling, nes-igf1r-/wt mice had significantly more apoptotic cells than that in controls after injury. to determine possible mechanisms of igf1r actions, the mrna expression of the pro-survival proteins iap- <dig> and xiap was determined. compared to controls, the abundance of ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna was markedly suppressed in mice with blunted igf1r or igf-i expression, while was increased in the brain of igf-i overexpressing transgenic mice.


CONCLUSIONS
igf1r in neuronal cells is critically important for their survival following h/i injury, and igf-upregulated expression of neuronal ciap- <dig> and xiap likely in part contributes to igf-igf1r protection against neuronal apoptosis following h/i injury.
