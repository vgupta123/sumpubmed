BACKGROUND
accurate assessment of probiotics with targeted anti-salmonella activity requires suitable models accounting for both, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions in gut environments. here we report the combination of two original in vitro intestinal models closely mimicking the complex in vivo conditions of the large intestine. effluents from continuous in vitro three-stage fermentation colonic models of salmonella typhimurium infection inoculated with immobilized child microbiota and salmonella were directly applied to confluent mucus-secreting ht29-mtx cell layers. the effects of salmonella, addition of two bacteriocinogenic strains, bifidobacterium thermophilum rbl <dig>  and escherichia coli l <dig> , and inulin were tested on salmonella growth and interactions with epithelial cell layers. salmonella adhesion and invasion were investigated and epithelial integrity assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance  measurements and confocal microscopy observation. data from complex effluents were compared with pure salmonella cultures.


RESULTS
salmonella in effluents of all reactors of the colonic fermentation model stabilized at mean values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml effluent. invasion of cell-associated salmonella was up to 50-fold lower in complex reactor samples compared to pure salmonella cultures. it further depended on environmental factors, with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % being measured with proximal,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % with transverse and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % with distal reactor effluents, accompanied by a similar high decrease of ter across cell monolayers  and disruption of tight junctions. subsequent addition of e. coli l <dig> stimulated salmonella growth  and further decreased ter, but led to 10-fold decreased invasion efficiency when tested with distal reactor samples. in contrast, presence of b. thermophilum rbl <dig> revealed a protective effect on epithelial integrity compared to previous e. coli l <dig> periods, as reflected by a significant mean increase of ter by 58% in all reactors. inulin addition enhanced salmonella growth and invasion when tested with distal and proximal reactor samples, respectively, but induced a limited decrease of ter  in all reactors.


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight the benefits of combining suitable cellular and colonic fermentation models to assess strain-specific first-level host protection properties of probiotics during salmonella infection, providing an efficient system biology tool for preclinical development of new antimicrobials.
