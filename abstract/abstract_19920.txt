BACKGROUND
the success of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis evolving as multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens is associated with their ability to acquire and share adaptive traits, including antimicrobial resistance genes encoded by mobile genetic elements . here, we investigate this mobilome in successful hospital associated genetic lineages, e. faecium sequence type  <dig>  and st <dig> , e. faecalis st <dig>  and st <dig>  by dna microarray analyses.


RESULTS
the hybridization patterns of  <dig> representative targets including plasmid backbones , transposable elements , resistance determinants , prophages  and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -cas sequences  separated the strains according to species, and for e. faecalis also according to sts. rcr-, rep_3-, repa_n- and inc18-family plasmids were highly prevalent and with the exception of rep_ <dig>  evenly distributed between the species. there was a considerable difference in the replicon profile, with rep17/prum, rep2/pre <dig>  rep14/efnp <dig> and rep20/plg <dig> dominating in e. faecium and rep9/pcf <dig>  rep2/pre <dig> and rep <dig> in e. faecalis strains. we observed an overall high correlation between the presence and absence of genes coding for resistance towards antibiotics, metals, biocides and their corresponding mges as well as their phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. although most is families were represented in both e. faecalis and e. faecium, specific is elements within these families were distributed in only one species. the prevalence of is256-, is3-, isl3-, is200/is605-, is110-, is982- and is4-transposases was significantly higher in e. faecium than e. faecalis, and that of is110-, is982- and is1182-transposases in e. faecalis st <dig> compared to st <dig>  notably, the transposases of is <dig>  isefm <dig> and is <dig> that have only been reported in few enterococcal isolates were well represented in the e. faecium strains. e. faecalis st <dig> strains harboured possible functional crispr-cas systems, and still resistance and prophage sequences were generally well represented.


CONCLUSIONS
the targeted mges were highly prevalent among the selected sts, underlining their potential importance in the evolution of hospital-adapted lineages of enterococci. although the propensity of inter-species horizontal gene transfer  must be emphasized, the considerable species-specificity of these mges indicates a separate vertical evolution of mges within each species, and for e. faecalis within each st.
