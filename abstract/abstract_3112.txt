BACKGROUND
the trophoblast kunitz domain proteins  constitute a highly expressed, placenta-specific, multigene family restricted to ruminant ungulates and characterized by a c-terminal "kunitz" domain, preceded by one or more unique n-terminal domains. tkdp- <dig> shares an almost identical expression pattern with interferon-tau, the "maternal recognition of pregnancy protein" in ruminants. our goal here has been to determine whether the ovine  tkdp- <dig> and ifnt genes possess a similar transcriptional code.


RESULTS
the ovtkdp- <dig> promoter has been cloned and characterized. as with the ifnt promoter, the tkdp- <dig> promoter is responsive to ets- <dig>  and promoter-driven reporter activity can be increased over 700-fold in response to over-expression of ets- <dig> and a constitutively active form of protein kinase a . unexpectedly, the promoter element of tkdp- <dig> responsible for this up-regulation, unlike that of the ifnt, does not bind ets- <dig>  however, mutation of a ccaat/enhancer binding element within this control region not only reduced basal transcriptional activity, but prevented ets- <dig> as well as cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate /pka and ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase  responsiveness. in vitro binding experiments and in vivo protein-protein interaction assays implicated ccaat/enhancer binding protein-beta  as involved in up-regulating the tkdp- <dig> promoter activity. a combination of ets- <dig> and c/ebp-β can up-regulate expression of the minimal tkdp- <dig> promoter as much as 930-fold in presence of a camp analog. an ap-1-like element adjacent to the ccaat enhancer, which binds jun family members, is required for basal and camp/ c/ebp-β-dependent activation of the gene, but not for ets-2-dependent activity.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper demonstrates how ets- <dig>  a key transcription factor for trophoblast differentiation and function, can control expression of two genes  having similar spatial and temporal expression patterns via very different mechanisms.
