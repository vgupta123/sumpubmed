BACKGROUND
the incorporation of biological knowledge can enhance the analysis of biomedical data. we present a novel method that uses a proteomic knowledge base to enhance the performance of a rule-learning algorithm in identifying putative biomarkers of disease from high-dimensional proteomic mass spectral data. in particular, we use the empirical proteomics ontology knowledge base  that contains previously identified and validated proteomic biomarkers to select m/zs in a proteomic dataset prior to analysis to increase performance.


RESULTS
we show that using epo-kb as a pre-processing method, specifically selecting all biomarkers found only in the biofluid of the proteomic dataset, reduces the dimensionality by 95% and provides a statistically significantly greater increase in performance over no variable selection and random variable selection.


CONCLUSIONS
knowledge-based variable selection even with a sparsely-populated resource such as the epo-kb increases overall performance of rule-learning for disease classification from high-dimensional proteomic mass spectra.
