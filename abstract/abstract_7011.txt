BACKGROUND
gastrodia elata blume  is an important chinese medicine with several functional components. in the life cycle of g. elata, the orchid develops a symbiotic relationship with two compatible mycorrhizal fungi mycena spp. and armillaria mellea during seed germination to form vegetative propagation corm and vegetative growth to develop tubers, respectively. gastrodin  is the most important functional component in g. elata, and gastrodin significantly increases from vegetative propagation corms to tubers. to address the gene regulation mechanism in gastrodin biosynthesis in g. elata, a comparative analysis of de novo transcriptome sequencing among the vegetative propagation corms and tubers of g. elata and a. mellea was conducted using deep sequencing.


RESULTS
transcriptome comparison between the vegetative propagation corms and juvenile tubers of g. elata revealed  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes, of which  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were, respectively up-regulated -normalized fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads  > 10) and down-regulated  in juvenile tubers. after gene ontology  annotation and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis,  <dig> up-regulated unigenes with kegg ortholog identifiers  or enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to  <dig> isogroups involved in seventy-eight different pathways, and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes with koids or ec numbers were assigned to  <dig> isogroups, involved in eighty different pathways. the analysis of the isogroup genes from all pathways revealed that the two unigenes trinity_dn54282_c0_g <dig>  and trinity_dn50323_c0_g <dig>  might participate in hydroxylation and glucosylation in the gastrodin biosynthetic pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene expression of the two unique unigenes encoding monooxygenase and glycosyltransferase significantly increases from vegetative propagation corms to tubers, and the molecular basis of gastrodin biosynthesis in the tubers of g. elata is proposed.
