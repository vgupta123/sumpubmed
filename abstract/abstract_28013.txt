BACKGROUND
ests or variable sequence reads can be available in prokaryotic studies well before a complete genome is known. use cases include  transcriptome studies or  single cell sequencing of bacteria. without suitable software their further analysis and mapping would have to await finalization of the corresponding genome.


RESULTS
the tool jane rapidly maps ests or variable sequence reads in prokaryotic sequencing and transcriptome efforts to related template genomes. it provides an easy-to-use graphics interface for information retrieval and a toolkit for est or nucleotide sequence function prediction. furthermore, we developed for rapid mapping an enhanced sequence alignment algorithm which reassembles and evaluates high scoring pairs provided from the blast algorithm. rapid assembly on and replacement of the template genome by sequence reads or mapped ests is achieved. this is illustrated  by data from staphylococci as well as from a blattabacteria sequencing effort,  mapping single cell sequencing reads is shown for poribacteria to sister phylum representative rhodopirellula baltica sh <dig>  the algorithm has been implemented in a web-server accessible at http://jane.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.


CONCLUSIONS
rapid prokaryotic est mapping or mapping of sequence reads is achieved applying jane even without knowing the cognate genome sequence.
