BACKGROUND
tlr <dig> assists in antiviral approach by producing type  <dig> inf via myd <dig> dependent irf <dig> pathway. however, over expression of infα/β molecule poses threat by developing tolerance in chronic infection cases and enhancing inflammatory response. here we report a bi-specific sirna based complex which differentially activates and silences the tlr <dig> and myd <dig> respectively in a negatively regulated fashion.


RESULTS
outer membrane vesicle from escherichia coli used for sirna delivery was observed more efficient when attached with invasive protein ail along with ompa  in hek293-tlr <dig> cell line. sirna complexed with p <dig> protein was efficient in activating tlr <dig>  confirmed by the increment of infβ molecules  in hek293-tlr <dig> compared to its counterpart. fusion of lipid bilayer of endosomal compartment was significant at ph  <dig>  when fusogenic peptides  were incubated in membrane vesicle, thus facilitating the escape of sirna complex to the host cytoplasm in order to silence myd <dig> transcript .


CONCLUSIONS
we investigated the activation of tlr <dig> by bi-specific si-rna for the production of infβ. in the same setting we showed that bi-specific si-rna was able to silence myd <dig> transcript in a delayed manner. for the cases of auto immune disease and inflammation where over activation of endosomal tlrs poses serious threat, bi specific sirna could be used as negative feedback controlled system.
