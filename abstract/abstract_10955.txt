BACKGROUND
cassava starch is considered as a potential source for the commercial production of bioethanol because of its availability and low market price. it can be used as a basic source to support large-scale biological production of bioethanol using microbial amylases. with the progression and advancement in enzymology, starch liquefying and saccharifying enzymes are preferred for the conversion of complex starch polymer into various valuable metabolites. these hydrolytic enzymes can selectively cleave the internal linkages of starch molecule to produce free glucose which can be utilized to produce bioethanol by microbial fermentation.


RESULTS
in the present study, several filamentous fungi were screened for production of amylases and among them aspergillus fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> was selected based on maximum enzyme yield. maximum α-amylase, amyloglucosidase and glucose formation was achieved after 03 days of fermentation using cassava starch. after salt precipitation, fold purification of α-amylase and amyloglucosidase increased up to  <dig>  and  <dig>  times with specific activity of  <dig>  kumg- <dig> and  <dig> kumg- <dig>  respectively. concentrated amylolytic enzyme mixture was incorporated in cassava starch slurry to give maximum glucose formation , which was further fermented using saccharomyces cerevisiae into bioethanol with  <dig> % yield. the distillate originated after recovery of bioethanol gave  <dig> % yield.


CONCLUSIONS
an improved and effective dual enzymatic starch degradation method is designed for the production of bioethanol using cassava starch. the technique developed is more profitable due to its fast liquefaction and saccharification approach that was employed for the formation of glucose and ultimately resulted in higher yields of alcohol production.
