BACKGROUND
5ht1a agonists have previously been shown to promote recovery in animal models of stroke using ex vivo outcome measures which have raised the hopes for a potential clinical implementation. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential neuroprotective properties of a novel 5ht1a agonist du <dig> in  <dig> different models of transient focal ischaemic stroke of varying severities using both in vivo neuroimaging and behavioural techniques as primary outcome measures. for these studies, the nmda receptor antagonist mk- <dig> was also utilized as a positive control to further assess the effectiveness of the stroke models and techniques used.


RESULTS
in contrast to mk- <dig>  no significant therapeutic effect of du <dig> on lesion volume in either the distal mcao or intraluminal thread model of stroke was found. mk- <dig> significantly reduced lesion volume in both models; the mild distal mcao condition  and the intraluminal thread model, although it had no significant impact upon the lesion size in the severe distal mcao condition . these therapeutic effects on lesion size were mirrored on a behavioural test for sensory neglect and neurological deficit score in the intraluminal thread model.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the need for a thorough experimental design to test novel neuroprotective compounds in experimental stroke investigations incorporating: a positive reference compound, different models of focal ischaemia, varying the duration of ischaemia, and objective in vivo assessments within a single study. this procedure will help us to minimise the translation of less efficacious compounds.
