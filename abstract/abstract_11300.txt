BACKGROUND
cerebellar abiotrophy  is a rare but significant disease in arabian horses caused by progressive death of the purkinje cells resulting in cerebellar ataxia characterized by a typical head tremor, jerky head movements and lack of menace response. the specific role of magnetic resonance imaging  to support clinical diagnosis has been discussed. however, as yet mr imaging has only been described in one equine ca case. the role of mr morphometry in this regard is currently unknown. due to the hereditary nature of the disease, genetic testing can support the diagnosis of ca.

therefore, the objective of this study was to perform mr morphometric analysis and genetic testing in four ca-affected arabian horses and one german riding pony with purebred arabian bloodlines in the third generation.


RESULTS
ca was diagnosed pathohistologically in the five affected horses  supported by clinical signs, necropsy, and genetic testing which confirmed the toe1:g.2171g>a snp genotype a/a in all ca-affected horses.

on mr images morphometric analysis of the relative cerebellar size and relative cerebellar cerebrospinal fluid  space were compared to control images of  <dig> unaffected horses. it was demonstrated that in mr morphometric analyses, ca affected horses displayed a relatively smaller cerebellum compared to the entire brain mass than control animals . the relative cerebellar csf space was larger in affected horses . using a cut off value of  <dig> % for relative cerebellar csf space, the parameter differentiated between ca-affected horses and controls with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, morphometric mri and genetic analysis could be helpful to support the diagnosis of ca in vivo.
