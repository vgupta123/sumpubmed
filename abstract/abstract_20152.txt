BACKGROUND
stripe rust  and powdery mildew  are important diseases of wheat  worldwide. increasingly evidences suggest that long intergenic ncrnas  are developmentally regulated and play important roles in development and stress responses of plants. however, identification of lincrnas in wheat is still limited comparing with functional gene expression.


RESULTS
the transcriptome of the hexaploid wheat line n <dig> inoculated with the chinese pst race cyr <dig> and bgt race e <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and 3 days post-inoculation was recapitulated to detect the lincrnas. here,  <dig> differential expressed lincrnas were identified from  <dig> putative lincrnas, which account for  <dig>  % of transcriptome. of which,  <dig> de-lincrnas responded to the bgt stress, and  <dig> lincrnas in pst. among them,  <dig> snrnp motifs  were detected and showed rru4–11rr sm site element and consensus rru1–9vu1–7rr snrnp motifs, where the total number of uridine was more than  <dig> but less than  <dig>  additionally,  <dig> de-lincrnas were predicted as targets of mirna by psrnatarget, while  <dig> target mimics were identified using target mimicry search in tapir.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings indicate that the lincrna of wheat responded to bgt and pst stress and played important roles in splicesome and inter-regulating with mirna. the sm site of wheat showed a more complex construction than that in mammal and model plant. the mass sequence data generated in this study provide a cue for future functional and molecular research on wheat–fungus interactions.
