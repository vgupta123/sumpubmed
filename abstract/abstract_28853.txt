BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is a facultative intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of melioidosis. a conserved type iii secretion system  and type vi secretion system  are critical for intracellular survival and growth. the t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> genes are coordinately and hierarchically regulated by a tetr-type regulator, bspr. a central transcriptional regulator of the bspr regulatory cascade, bsan, activates a subset of t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> loci.


RESULTS
to elucidate the scope of the bsan regulon, we used rnaseq analysis to compare the transcriptomes of wild-type b. pseudomallei khw and a bsan deletion mutant. the  <dig> genes positively-regulated by bsan include those that we had previously identified in addition to a polyketide biosynthesis locus and genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. bsan was also found to repress the transcription of  <dig> genes including flagellar motility loci and those encoding components of the t3ss <dig> apparatus. using a promoter-lacz fusion assay in e. coli, we show that bsan together with the chaperone bica directly control the expression of the t3ss <dig> translocon, effector and associated regulatory genes that are organized into at least five operons . using a mutagenesis approach, a consensus regulatory motif in the promoter regions of bsan-regulated genes was shown to be essential for transcriptional activation.


CONCLUSIONS
bsan/bica functions as a central regulator of key virulence clusters in b. pseudomallei within a more extensive network of genetic regulation. we propose that bsan/bica controls a gene expression program that facilitates the adaption and intracellular survival of the pathogen within eukaryotic hosts.
