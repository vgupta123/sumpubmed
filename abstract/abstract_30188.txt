BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins  contribute to many different aspects of development including mesoderm formation, heart development, neurogenesis, skeletal development, and axis formation. they have previously been recognized only as secreted growth factors, but the present study detected bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and gdf5/cdmp <dig> in the nuclei of cultured cells using immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting of nuclear extracts.


RESULTS
in all three proteins, a bipartite nuclear localization signal  was found to overlap the site at which the proproteins are cleaved to release the mature growth factors from the propeptides. mutational analyses indicated that the nuclear variants of these three proteins are produced by initiating translation from downstream alternative start codons. the resulting proteins lack n-terminal signal peptides and are therefore translated in the cytoplasm rather than the endoplasmic reticulum, thus avoiding proteolytic processing in the secretory pathway. instead, the uncleaved proteins  containing the intact nlss are translocated to the nucleus. immunostaining of endogenous nbmp <dig> in cultured cells demonstrated that the amount of nbmp <dig> as well as its nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution differs between cells that are in m-phase versus other phases of the cell cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
the observation that nbmp <dig> localization varies throughout the cell cycle, as well as the conservation of a nuclear localization mechanism among three different bmp family members, suggests that these novel nuclear variants of bmp family proteins play an important functional role in the cell.
