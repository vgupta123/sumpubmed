BACKGROUND
idiopathic epilepsy is a common neurological disease in human and domestic dogs but relatively few risk genes have been identified to date. the seizure characteristics, including focal and generalised seizures, are similar between the two species, with gene discovery facilitated by the reduced genetic heterogeneity of purebred dogs. we have recently identified a risk locus for idiopathic epilepsy in the belgian shepherd breed on a  <dig>  megabase region on cfa <dig> 


RESULTS
we have expanded a previous study replicating the association with a combined analysis of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls in three additional breeds: schipperke, finnish spitz and beagle . a targeted resequencing of the  <dig>  megabase region in twelve belgian shepherd cases and twelve controls with opposite haplotypes identified  <dig> case-specific variants within the adam <dig> gene. twenty-seven variants were validated in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls from four breeds, resulting in a strong replication of the adam <dig> locus  and the identification of a common 28 kb-risk haplotype in all four breeds. risk haplotype was present in frequencies of  <dig> – <dig>  in the breeds, suggesting that adam <dig> is a low penetrance risk gene for canine epilepsy.


CONCLUSIONS
these results implicate adam <dig> in common canine idiopathic epilepsy, although the causative variant remains yet to be identified. adam <dig> plays a role in synaptic transmission and interacts with known epilepsy genes, lgi <dig> and lgi <dig>  and should be considered as a candidate gene for human epilepsies.
