BACKGROUND
ochroconis mirabilis, a recently introduced water-borne dematiaceous fungus, is occasionally isolated from human skin lesions and nails. we identified an isolate of o. mirabilis from a skin scraping with morphological and molecular studies. its genome was then sequenced and analysed for genetic features related to classification and biological characteristics.


RESULTS
um  <dig> was identified as o. mirabilis based on morphology and internal transcribed spacer -based phylogeny. the  <dig>  mb assembled genome with  <dig>  predicted genes showed less efficiency of this isolate in plant cell wall degradation. results from the peptidase comparison analysis with reported keratin-degrading peptidases from dermatophytes suggest that um  <dig> is very unlikely to be utilising these peptidases to survive in the host. nevertheless, we have identified peptidases from m10a, m12a and s <dig> families that may allow um  <dig> to invade its host via extracellular matrix and collagen degradation. furthermore, the lipases in um  <dig> may have a role in supporting the fungus in host invasion. this fungus has the potential ability to synthesise melanin via the  <dig> -dihydroxynaphthalene -melanin pathway and to produce mycotoxins. the mating ability of this fungus was also inspected in this study and a mating type gene containing alpha domain was identified. this fungus is likely to produce taurine that is required in osmoregulation. the expanded gene family encoding the taurine catabolism dioxygenase taud/tdfa domain suggests the utilisation of taurine under sulfate starvation. the expanded glutathione-s-transferase domains and rta1-like protein families indicate the selection of genes in um  <dig> towards adaptation in hostile environments.


CONCLUSIONS
the genomic analysis of o. mirabilis um  <dig> provides a better understanding of fungal survival tactics in different habitats.
