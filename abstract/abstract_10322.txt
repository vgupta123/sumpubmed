BACKGROUND
chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that possess a type iii secretion system to deliver proteins into the host cell during infection. small molecule inhibitors of type iii secretion in yersinia, termed inps  were reported to strongly inhibit chlamydia growth in epithelial cells. in this study we have analyzed the effect of these drugs on bacterial invasiveness.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that inps affect chlamydia growth in a dose dependent manner after bacterial invasion. the efficiency of c. trachomatis l <dig> and c. caviae gpic entry into host cells was not altered in the presence of inps. in c. caviae, entry appears to proceed normally with recruitment of actin and the small gtpases rac, cdc <dig> and arf <dig> to the site of bacterial entry.


CONCLUSIONS
inps have a strong inhibitory effect on chlamydia growth. however, bacterial invasion is not altered in the presence of these drugs. in the light of these results, we discuss several hypotheses regarding the mode of action of inps on type iii secretion during the chlamydia infectious cycle.
