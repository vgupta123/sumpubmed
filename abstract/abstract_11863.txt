BACKGROUND
a major constraint affecting the quality and productivity of chrysanthemum is the unusual period of low temperature occurring during early spring, late autumn, and winter. yet, there has been no systematic investigation on the genes underlying the response to low temperature in chrysanthemum. herein, we used rna-seq platform to characterize the transcriptomic response to low temperature by comparing different transcriptome of chrysanthemum nankingense plants and subjecting them to a period of sub-zero temperature, with or without a prior low temperature acclimation.


RESULTS
six separate rna-seq libraries were generated from the rna samples of leaves and stems from six different temperature treatments, including one cold acclimation , two freezing treatments without prior ca, two freezing treatments with prior ca and the control. at least seven million clean reads were obtained from each library. over 77% of the reads could be mapped to sets of c. nankingense unigenes established previously. the differentially transcribed genes  were identified as low temperature sensing and signalling genes, transcription factors, functional proteins associated with the abiotic response, and low temperature-responsive genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation. the differential transcription of  <dig> dtgs was validated using quantitative rt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
the large number of dtgs identified in this study, confirmed the complexity of the regulatory machinery involved in the processes of low temperature acclimation and low temperature/freezing tolerance.
