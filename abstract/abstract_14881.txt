BACKGROUND
allergic sensitisation has been ascribed to a dysregulated relationship between allergen-specific th <dig>  th <dig> and regulatory t cells. we sought to utilise our short-term cd <dig> detection method to further analyse the relationship between these t cell subsets and investigate differences between seasonal and perennial allergens. using peripheral blood samples from grass-allergic, cat-allergic and healthy non-atopic subjects, we compared the frequencies and phenotype of cd154-positive t helper cells following stimulation with seasonal  and perennial  allergens.


RESULTS
we identified a higher frequency of cd154+ t cells in grass-allergic individuals compared to healthy controls; this difference was not evident following stimulation with cat allergen. activated th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like cells, that co-express ifnÎ³, il <dig> and il <dig>  respectively, were identified in varying proportions in grass-allergic, cat-allergic and non-allergic individuals. we confirmed a close correlation between th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like cell frequency in non-allergic volunteers, such that the three parameters increased together to maintain a low th2: th <dig> ratio. this relationship was dysregulated in grass-allergic individuals with no correlation between the t cell subsets and a higher th2: th <dig> ratio. we confirmed previous reports of a late-differentiated t cell phenotype in response to seasonal allergens compared to early-differentiated t cell responses to perennial allergens.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings confirm our existing work illustrating an important balance between th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like responses to allergens in health, where th <dig> responses are frequently observed, but balanced by th <dig> and regulatory responses. we confirm previous tetramer-based reports of phenotypic differences in t cells responding to seasonal and perennial allergens.
