BACKGROUND
mitochondrial genome sequence analysis is critical to the diagnostic evaluation of mitochondrial disease. existing methodologies differ widely in throughput, complexity, cost efficiency, and sensitivity of heteroplasmy detection. affymetrix mitochip v <dig> , which uses a sequencing-by-genotyping technology, allows potentially accurate and high-throughput sequencing of the entire human mitochondrial genome to be completed in a cost-effective fashion. however, the relatively low call rate achieved using existing software tools has limited the wide adoption of this platform for either clinical or research applications. here, we report the design and development of a custom bioinformatics software pipeline that achieves a much improved call rate and accuracy for the affymetrix mitochip v <dig>  platform. we used this custom pipeline to analyze mitochip v <dig>  data from  <dig> dna samples representing a broad range of tissue types , mutations , and haplogroup origins. all results were compared to those obtained by at least one other mitochondrial dna sequence analysis method, including sanger sequencing, denaturing hplc-based heteroduplex analysis, and/or the illumina genome analyzer ii next generation sequencing platform.


RESULTS
an average call rate of  <dig> % was achieved across all samples with our custom pipeline. comparison of calls for  <dig> samples characterized previously by sanger sequencing revealed a total of  <dig> discordant calls, which translates to an estimated  <dig> % for the base call error rate. we successfully identified  <dig> known heteroplasmic mutations and  <dig> other potential heteroplasmic mutations across  <dig> samples that passed quality control.


CONCLUSIONS
affymetrix mitochip v <dig>  analysis using our optimized mitochip filtering protocol  bioinformatics pipeline now offers the high sensitivity and accuracy needed for reliable, high-throughput and cost-efficient whole mitochondrial genome sequencing. this approach provides a viable alternative of potential utility for both clinical diagnostic and research applications to traditional sanger and other emerging sequencing technologies for whole mitochondrial genome analysis.
