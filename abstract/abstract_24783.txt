BACKGROUND
carbonic anhydrase  is a ubiquitous enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of co <dig> to bicarbonate, a reaction underlying diverse biochemical and physiological processes. gamma class carbonic anhydrases  are widespread in prokaryotes but their physiological roles remain elusive. at present, only γ-ca of methanosarcina thermophila  has been shown to have ca activity. genome analysis of a rhizobacterium azospirillum brasilense, revealed occurrence of orfs encoding one β-ca and two γ-cas.


RESULTS
one of the putative γ-ca encoding genes of a. brasilense was cloned and overexpressed in e. coli. electrometric assays for ca activity of the whole cell extracts overexpressing recombinant gca <dig> did not show co <dig> hydration activity. reverse transcription-pcr analysis indicated that gca <dig> in a. brasilense is co-transcribed with its upstream gene annotated as argc, which encodes a putative n-acetyl-γ-glutamate-phosphate reductase. 5'-race also demonstrated that there was no transcription start site between argc and gca <dig>  and the transcription start site located upstream of argc transcribed both the genes . using transcriptional fusions of argc-gca <dig> upstream region with promoterless lacz, we further demonstrated that gca <dig> upstream region did not have any promoter and its transcription occurred from a promoter located in the argc upstream region. the transcription of argc-gca <dig> operon was upregulated in stationary phase and at elevated co <dig> atmosphere.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows lack of co <dig> hydration activity in a recombinant protein expressed from a gene predicted to encode a γ-carbonic anhydrase in a. brasilense although it cross reacts with anti-cam antibody raised against a well characterized γ-ca. the organization and regulation of this gene along with the putative argc gene suggests its involvement in arginine biosynthetic pathway instead of the predicted co <dig> hydration.
