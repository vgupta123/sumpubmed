BACKGROUND
the continued depletion of tropical rainforests and fragmentation of natural habitats has led to significant ecological changes which place most top carnivores under heavy pressure. various methods have been used to determine the status of top carnivore populations in rainforest habitats, most of which are costly in terms of equipment and time. in this study we utilized, for the first time, a rigorous track classification method to estimate population size and density of clouded leopards  in tabin wildlife reserve in north-eastern borneo .

additionally, we extrapolated our local-scale results to the regional landscape level to estimate clouded leopard population size and density in all of sabah's reserves, taking into account the reserves' conservation status , their size and presence or absence of clouded leopards.


RESULTS
the population size in the  <dig> km <dig> research area was estimated to be five individuals, based on a capture-recapture analysis of four confirmed animals differentiated by their tracks. extrapolation of these results led to density estimates of nine per  <dig> km <dig> in tabin wildlife reserve. the true density most likely lies between our approximately  <dig> % confidence interval of eight to  <dig> individuals per  <dig> km <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that previous density estimates of  <dig> animals/ <dig> km <dig> most likely overestimated the true density. applying the 95% confidence interval we calculated in total a very rough number of 1500– <dig> clouded leopards to be present in sabah. however, only 275– <dig> of these animals inhabit the four totally protected reserves that are large enough to hold a long-term viable population of >  <dig> individuals.
