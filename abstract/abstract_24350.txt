BACKGROUND
in mammals, there is evidence suggesting that methyl-cpg binding proteins may play a significant role in histone modification through their association with modification complexes that can deacetylate and/or methylate nucleosomes in the proximity of methylated dna. we examined this idea for the x chromosome by studying histone modifications on the x chromosome in normal cells and in cells from patients with icf syndrome . in normal cells the inactive x has characteristic silencing type histone modification patterns and the cpg islands of genes subject to x inactivation are hypermethylated. in icf cells, however, genes subject to x inactivation are hypomethylated on the inactive x due to mutations in the dna methyltransferase  genes. therefore, if dna methylation is upstream of histone modification, the histones on the inactive x in icf cells should not be modified to a silent form. in addition, we determined whether a specific methyl-cpg binding protein, mecp <dig>  is necessary for the inactive x histone modification pattern by studying rett syndrome cells which are deficient in mecp <dig> function.


RESULTS
we show here that the inactive x in icf cells, which appears to be hypomethylated at all cpg islands, exhibits normal histone modification patterns. in addition, in rett cells with no functional mecp <dig> methyl-cpg binding protein, the inactive x also exhibits normal histone modification patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that dna methylation and the associated methyl-dna binding proteins may not play a critical role in determining histone modification patterns on the mammalian inactive x chromosome at the sites analyzed.
