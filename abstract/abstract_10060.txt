BACKGROUND
dioxins are one of the most toxic groups of persistent organic pollutants. their bioaccumulation through the food chain constitutes a potential risk for human health. upon cell entry, dioxins bind specifically and firmly to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , leading to the stimulation of several enzymes responsible for its detoxification. dioxin/ahr interaction could be exploited as an affordable alternative to a variety of analytical methods for detecting dioxin contamination in the environment.


RESULTS
in this work, the ligand binding domain  of the ahr was cloned downstream a superfolder form of the green fluorescent protein , resulting in the construct prset-sfgfp-ahr. high level of expressed sfgfp-ahr fusion protein  was recovered from the inclusion bodies of e. coli by simple solubilization with the arginine, and purified by affinity chromatography via its n-terminal 6 × his tag. its purity was confirmed by sds-page analysis and immunoblotting with anti-his or anti-gfp antibodies. indirect elisa revealed the ability of the sfgfp-ahr, but not the sfgfp, to bind to the immobilized dioxin with the possibility to detect such interaction by both its 6 × his and gfp tags,competitive elisa showed that anti-dioxin antibody was more sensitive to low dioxin concentrations than sfgfp-ahr. nevertheless,the detection range of sfgfp-ahr fusion was much wider and the detection limit was of about 10 ppt  of free dioxin in the tested artificial samples.


CONCLUSIONS
this highly expressed and functional sfgfp-ahr fusion protein provides a promising molecular tool for detecting and quantifying different congeners of dioxins.
