BACKGROUND
y haplogroup analyses are an important component of genealogical reconstruction, population genetic analyses, medical genetics and forensics. these fields are increasingly moving towards use of low-coverage, high throughput sequencing. while there have been methods recently proposed for assignment of y haplogroups on the basis of high-coverage sequence data, assignment on the basis of low-coverage data remains challenging.


RESULTS
we developed a new algorithm, yhap, which uses an imputation framework to jointly predict y chromosome genotypes and assign y haplogroups using low coverage population sequence data. we use data from the  <dig> genomes project to demonstrate that yhap provides accurate y haplogroup assignment with less than 2x coverage.


CONCLUSIONS
borrowing information across multiple samples within a population using an imputation framework enables accurate y haplogroup assignment.
