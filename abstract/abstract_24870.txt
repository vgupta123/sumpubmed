BACKGROUND
the unique s <dig> family of proteases is comprised of the carboxypeptidase prcp and the aminopeptidase dpp <dig>  the structural basis of the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes is not understood nor has the structure of the s <dig> fold been described.


RESULTS
the experimentally phased  <dig>  Å crystal structure is presented for human prcp. prcp contains an α/β hydrolase domain harboring the catalytic asp-his-ser triad and a novel helical structural domain that caps the active site. structural comparisons with prolylendopeptidase and dpp <dig> identify the s <dig> proline binding site of prcp. a structure-based alignment with the previously undescribed structure of dpp <dig> illuminates the mechanism of orthogonal substrate specificity of prcp and dpp <dig>  prcp has an extended active-site cleft that can accommodate proline substrates with multiple n-terminal residues. in contrast, the substrate binding groove of dpp <dig> is occluded by a short amino-acid insertion unique to dpp <dig> that creates a truncated active site selective for dipeptidyl proteolysis of n-terminal substrates.


CONCLUSIONS
the results define the structure of the s <dig> family of proteases, provide the structural basis of prcp and dpp <dig> substrate specificity and enable the rational design of selective prcp modulators.
