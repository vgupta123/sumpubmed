BACKGROUND
group ii intron splicing proceeds through two sequential transesterification reactions in which the 5' and 3'-exons are joined together and the lariat intron is released. the intron-encoded protein  assists the splicing of the intron in vivo and remains bound to the excised intron lariat rna in a ribonucleoprotein particle  that promotes intron mobility. exon recognition occurs through base-pairing interactions between two guide sequences on the ribozyme domain di known as ebs <dig> and ebs <dig> and two stretches of sequence known as ibs <dig> and ibs <dig> on the 5' exon, whereas the 3' exon is recognized through interaction with the sequence immediately upstream from ebs <dig>  or with a nucleotide  located in the coordination-loop of di. the δ nucleotide is involved in base pairing with another intron residue  in subgroup iib introns and this interaction facilitates base pairing between the 5' exon and the intron.


RESULTS
in this study, we investigated nucleotide requirements in the distal 5'- and 3' exon regions, ebs-ibs interactions and δ-δ' pairing for excision of the group iib intron rmint <dig> in vivo. we found that the ebs1-ibs <dig> interaction was required and sufficient for rmint <dig> excision. in addition, we provide evidence for the occurrence of canonical δ-δ' pairing and its importance for the intron excision in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
the excision in vivo of the rmint <dig> intron is a favored process, with very few constraints for sequence recognition in both the 5' and 3'-exons. our results contribute to understand how group ii introns spread in nature, and might facilitate the use of rmint <dig> in gene targeting.
