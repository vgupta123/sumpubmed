BACKGROUND
hundreds of hsp40s derived from various species have been identified, of which several proteins are involved in spermatogenesis. dnajb <dig> is a type ii hsp40/dnaj protein. in a previous study, we cloned mouse dnajb <dig>  which is up-regulated in cryptorchidism. to date, however, little is known about the localization and functions of dnajb <dig> during spermatogenesis. this study intends to identify the expression pattern of dnajb <dig> during mammalian spermatogenesis.


RESULTS
rt-pcr and western blot revealed that the dnajb <dig> gene and dnajb <dig> protein were expressed not only in the testis but also in several other ciliated cell-containing tissues like the trachea, lung and oviduct. quantitative pcr showed that the expression of dnajb <dig> mrna in testis was detectable as early as postnatal week  <dig>  and sharply increased from postnatal week  <dig>  western blotting and immunohistochemistry determined that the dnajb <dig> protein, which was located in the cytoplasm of spermatids and the sperm flagellum, was detectable from postnatal week  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
based on the spatiotemporal expression observed in the cytoplasm of spermatids and sperm flagella, we suggest that dnajb <dig> participates in spermiogenesis and the motility of mature spermatozoa.
