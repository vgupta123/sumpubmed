BACKGROUND
proteins of the c-terminal binding protein  family, ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> are closely related transcriptional regulators that are coded by two different gene loci in the vertebrate genomes. they perform redundant and unique functions during animal development. ctbp proteins mediate their transcriptional function through interaction with various dna-binding repressors that contain pldls-like motifs and chromatin modifying enzymes, such as class i histone deacetylases  that do not contain such motifs. the n-terminal region of ctbp1/ <dig> forms a hydrophobic cleft and is involved in interaction with both pldls-containing factors and non-pldls factors. ctbp proteins function as dimers to mediate transcriptional repression and dimerization is modulated by specific binding to nad/nadh.


RESULTS
in this study, we have investigated the role of dimerization of ctbp <dig> in recruitment of pldls-motif cofactors and non-pldls cofactors. our results indicate that mutations in ctbp <dig> that interfere with dimerization abolish ctbp <dig> interaction with most cellular factors, except the pldls-motif factor zinc-finger e-box binding homeobox  and the non-pldls factor hdac <dig>  unlike most pldls-containing ctbp-binding proteins, zeb contains three pldls-like motifs and all three contribute to the interaction with the ctbp <dig> monomer. despite the ability to interact with zeb and hdac, the ctbp <dig> monomer fails to mediate zeb-dependent transcriptional repression. the lack of repression activity of the ctbp <dig> monomer is correlated with the competition between zeb and hdac for interaction with the ctbp <dig> monomer.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest a competition between the canonical pldls-motif factors such as e1a and non-pldls factor hdac for interaction with ctbp. they also indicate that the affinity for the ctbp monomer may be determined by the number as well as amino acid sequence compositions of the pldls-like motifs. our results are consistent with a model that the ctbp <dig> dimer may interact with a pldls-containing repressor through one monomer and recruit hdac and other chromatin modifying enzymes through the second monomer in the ctbp <dig> dimer.
