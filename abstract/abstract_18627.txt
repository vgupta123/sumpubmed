BACKGROUND
hemangioblasts are known as the common precursors for primitive hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. their existence has been supported mainly by the observation that both cell types develop in close proximity and by in vitro differentiation and genetic studies. however, more compelling evidence will arise from tracking their cell fates using a lineage-specific marker.


RESULTS
we report the identification of a hemangioblast-specific enhancer  located in the cis-regulatory region of chick cerberus gene  that is able to direct the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein  to the precursors of yolk sac blood and endothelial cells in electroporated chick embryos. moreover, we present the hb-egfp reporter as a powerful live imaging tool for visualizing hemangioblast cell fate and blood island morphogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
we hereby introduce the hb enhancer as a valuable resource for genetically targeting the hemangioblast population as well as for studying the dynamics of vascular and blood cell development.
