BACKGROUND
the formation of the east african rift system has decisively influenced the distribution and evolution of tropical africa’s biota by altering climate conditions, by creating basins for large long-lived lakes, and by affecting the catchment and drainage directions of river systems. however, it remains unclear how rifting affected the biogeographical patterns of freshwater biota through time on a continental scale, which is further complicated by the scarcity of molecular data from the largest african river system, the congo.


RESULTS
we study these biogeographical patterns using a fossil-calibrated multi-locus phylogeny of the gastropod family viviparidae. this group allows reconstructing drainage patterns exceptionally well because it disperses very poorly in the absence of existing freshwater connections. our phylogeny covers localities from major drainage basins of tropical africa and reveals highly disjunct sister-group relationships between  the endemic viviparids of lake malawi and populations from the middle congo as well as between  the victoria region and the okavango/upper zambezi area.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study testifies to repeated disruptions of the distribution of the viviparidae during the formation of the east african rift system, and to a central role of the congo river system for the distribution of the continent’s freshwater fauna during the late cenozoic. by integrating our results with previous findings on palaeohydrographical connections, we provide a spatially and temporarily explicit model of historical freshwater biogeography in tropical africa. finally, we review similarities and differences in patterns of vertebrate and invertebrate dispersal. amongst others we argue that the closest relatives of present day viviparids in lake malawi are living in the middle congo river, thus shedding new light on the origin of the endemic fauna of this rift lake.
