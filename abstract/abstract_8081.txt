BACKGROUND
secondary metabolism in serratia sp. atcc  <dig>  is controlled via a complex network of regulators, including a luxir-type  quorum sensing  system. here we investigate the molecular mechanism by which phosphate limitation controls biosynthesis of two antibiotic secondary metabolites, prodigiosin and carbapenem, in serratia  <dig> 


RESULTS
we demonstrate that a mutation in the high affinity phosphate transporter pstscab-phou, believed to mimic low phosphate conditions, causes upregulation of secondary metabolism and qs in serratia  <dig>  via the phobr two-component system. phosphate limitation also activated secondary metabolism and qs in serratia  <dig>  in addition, a psts mutation resulted in upregulation of rap. rap, a putative slya/marr-family transcriptional regulator, shares similarity with the global regulator rova  from yersina spp. and is an activator of secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig>  we demonstrate that expression of rap, piga-o  and smai are controlled via phobr in serratia  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
phosphate limitation regulates secondary metabolism in serratia  <dig> via multiple inter-linked pathways, incorporating transcriptional control mediated by three important global regulators, phob, smar and rap.
