BACKGROUND
small noncoding rnas , including short interfering rnas  and micrornas , can silence genes at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional or translational level  <cit> .


RESULTS
here, we show that microrna-10a  targets a homologous dna region in the promoter region of the hoxd <dig> gene and represses its expression at the transcriptional level. mutational analysis of the mir-10a sequence revealed that the 3' end of the mirna sequence is the most critical element for the silencing effect. microrna-10a-induced transcriptional gene inhibition requires the presence of dicer and argonautes  <dig> and  <dig>  and it is related to promoter associated noncoding rnas. bisulfite sequencing analysis showed that the reduced hoxd <dig> expression was accompanied by de novo dna methylation at the hoxd <dig> promoter. we further demonstrated that trimethylation of histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  is involved in the mir-10a-induced hoxd <dig> transcriptional gene silence.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that mir-10a can regulate human gene expression in a transcriptional manner, and indicate that endogenous small noncoding rna-induced control of transcription may be a potential system for expressional regulation in human breast cancer cells.
