BACKGROUND
the success of anti-tnf biologics for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has highlighted the importance of understanding the intracellular pathways that regulate tnf production in the quest for an orally-available small molecule inhibitor. p <dig> is known to strongly regulate tnf production via mk <dig>  the failure of several p <dig> inhibitors in the clinic suggests the importance of other downstream pathways in normal cell function. recent work has described a 'substrate-selective' p <dig> inhibitor that is able to preferentially block the activity of p <dig> against one substrate  versus another . using a combined experimental and computational approach, we have examined this mechanism in greater detail for two p <dig> substrates, mk <dig> and atf <dig> 


RESULTS
we found that in a dual  substrate assay, mk2-p <dig> interaction reduced the activity of p <dig> against atf <dig>  we further constructed a detailed kinetic mechanistic model of p <dig> phosphorylation in the presence of multiple substrates and successfully predicted the performance of classical and so-called 'substrate-selective' p <dig> inhibitors in the dual substrate assay. importantly, it was found that excess mk <dig> results in a stoichiometric effect in which the formation of p38-mk2-inhibitor complex prevents the phosphorylation of atf <dig>  despite the preference of the compound for the p38-mk <dig> complex over the p38-atf <dig> complex. mk <dig> and p <dig> protein expression levels were quantified in u <dig>  thp- <dig> and pbmcs and found that  > .


CONCLUSIONS
our integrated mechanistic modeling and experimental validation provides an example of how systems biology approaches can be applied to drug discovery and provide a basis for decision-making with limited chemical matter. we find that, given our current understanding, it is unlikely that 'substrate-selective' inhibitors of p <dig> will work as originally intended when placed in the context of more complex cellular environments, largely due to a stoichiometric excess of mk <dig> relative to p <dig>
