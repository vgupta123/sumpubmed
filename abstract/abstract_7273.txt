BACKGROUND
the pou family genes containing the pou domain are common in vertebrates and invertebrates and play critical roles in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell fate determination.


RESULTS
har-pou, a new member of the pou gene family, was cloned from the suboesophageal ganglion of helicoverpa armigera , and its potential functions in the development of the central nervous system  were analyzed. southern blot analysis suggests that a single copy of this gene is present in the h. armigera haploid genome. har-pou mrna is distributed widely in various tissues and expressed highly in the cns, salivary gland, and trachea. in vitro-translated har-pou specifically bound canonical octamer motifs on the promoter of diapause hormone and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  gene in h. armigera. expression of the har-pou gene is markedly higher in the cns of nondiapause-destined pupae than in diapause-destined pupae. expression of the har-pou gene in diapausing pupae was upregulated quickly by injection of ecdysone.


CONCLUSIONS
har-pou may respond to ecdysone and bind to the promoter of dh-pban gene to regulate pupal development in h. armigera.
