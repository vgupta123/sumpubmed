BACKGROUND
sox <dig> is a core component of the transcriptional network responsible for maintaining embryonal carcinoma cells  in a pluripotent, undifferentiated state of self-renewal. as such, sox <dig> is an oncogenic transcription factor and crucial cancer stem cell  biomarker in embryonal carcinoma and, as more recently found, in the stem-like cancer cell component of many other malignancies. sox <dig> is furthermore a crucial factor in the maintenance of adult stem cell phenotypes and has additional roles in cell fate determination. the sox2-linked microrna  transcriptome and regulome has not yet been fully defined in human pluripotent cells or cscs. to improve our understanding of the sox2-linked mirna regulatory network as a contribution to the phenotype of these cell types, we used high-throughput differential mirna and gene expression analysis combined with existing genome-wide sox <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation  data to map the sox <dig> mirna transcriptome in two human embryonal carcinoma cell  lines.


RESULTS
whole-micrornaome and genome analysis of sox2-silenced heccs revealed many mirnas regulated by sox <dig>  including several with highly characterised functions in both cancer and embryonic stem cell  biology. we subsequently performed genome-wide differential expression analysis and applied a monte carlo simulation algorithm and target prediction to identify a sox2-linked mirna regulome, which was strongly enriched with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  markers. additionally, several deregulated mirnas important to emt processes had sox <dig> binding sites in their promoter regions.


CONCLUSIONS
in esc-like cscs, sox <dig> regulates a large mirna network that regulates and interlinks the expression of crucial genes involved in emt.
