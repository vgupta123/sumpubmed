BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens f <dig> is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium  isolated from the sugar-beet rhizosphere. this bacterium has been extensively studied as a model strain for genetic regulation of secondary metabolite production in p. fluorescens, as a candidate biocontrol agent against phytopathogens, and as a heterologous host for expression of genes with biotechnological application. the f <dig> genome sequence and annotation has been recently reported.


RESULTS
comparative analysis of  <dig> genome sequences of strains belonging to the p. fluorescens group has revealed the existence of five distinct subgroups. f <dig> belongs to subgroup i, which is mostly composed of strains classified as p. brassicacearum. the core genome of these five strains is highly conserved and represents approximately 76% of the protein-coding genes in any given genome. despite this strong conservation, f <dig> also contains a large number of unique protein-coding genes that encode traits potentially involved in the rhizocompetence of this strain. these features include protein coding genes required for denitrification, diterpenoids catabolism, motility and chemotaxis, protein secretion and production of antimicrobial compounds and insect toxins.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome of p. fluorescens f <dig> is composed of numerous protein-coding genes, not usually found together in previously sequenced genomes, which are potentially decisive during the colonisation of the rhizosphere and/or interaction with other soil organisms. this includes genes encoding proteins involved in the production of a second flagellar apparatus, the use of abietic acid as a growth substrate, the complete denitrification pathway, the possible production of a macrolide antibiotic and the assembly of multiple protein secretion systems.
