BACKGROUND
ultraviolet b  irradiation can influence many cellular processes. irradiation with high uv-b doses causes chlorophyll degradation, a decrease in the expression of genes associated with photosynthesis and its subsequent inhibition. on the other hand, sublethal doses of uv-b are used in post-harvest technology to prevent yellowing in storage. to address this inconsistency the effect of short, high-dose uv-b irradiation on detached arabidopsis thaliana leaves was examined.


RESULTS
two different experimental models were used. after short treatment with a high dose of uv-b the arabidopsis leaves were either put into darkness or exposed to constant light for up to 4 days. uv-b inhibited dark-induced chlorophyll degradation in arabidopsis leaves in a dose-dependent manner. the expression of photosynthesis-related genes, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency were higher in uv-b -treated leaves left in darkness. uv-b treatment followed by constant light caused leaf yellowing and induced the expression of senescence-related genes. irrespective of light treatment a high uv-b dose led to clearly visible cell death 3 days after irradiation.


CONCLUSIONS
high doses of uv-b have opposing effects on leaves depending on their light status after uv treatment. in darkened leaves short uv-b treatment delays the appearance of senescence symptoms. when followed by light treatment, the same doses of uv-b result in chlorophyll degradation. this restricts the potential usability of uv treatment in postharvest technology to crops which are stored in darkness.
