BACKGROUND
quantitative phenotypic variation of agronomic characters in crop plants is controlled by environmental and genetic factors . to understand the molecular basis of such qtl, the identification of the underlying genes is of primary interest and dna sequence analysis of the genomic regions harboring qtl is a prerequisite for that. qtl mapping in potato  has identified a region on chromosome v tagged by dna markers gp <dig> and gp <dig>  which contains a number of important qtl, among others qtl for resistance to late blight caused by the oomycete phytophthora infestans and to root cyst nematodes.


RESULTS
to obtain genomic sequence for the targeted region on chromosome v, two local bac  contigs were constructed and sequenced, which corresponded to parts of the homologous chromosomes of the diploid, heterozygous genotype p6/ <dig>  two contiguous sequences of  <dig>  and  <dig>  base pairs were assembled and annotated. gene-by-gene co-linearity was disrupted by non-allelic insertions of retrotransposon elements, stretches of diverged intergenic sequences, differences in gene content and gene order. the latter was caused by inversion of a  <dig> kbp genomic fragment. these features were also found in comparison to orthologous sequence contigs from three homeologous chromosomes of solanum demissum, a wild tuber bearing species. functional annotation of the sequence identified  <dig> putative open reading frames  in one contig and  <dig> in the other, with an average of one orf every  <dig> kbp. ten orfs were classified as resistance-gene-like,  <dig> as f-box-containing genes,  <dig> as transposable elements and three as transcription factors. comparing potato to arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins revealed five micro-syntenic blocks of three to seven orfs with a. thaliana chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
comparative sequence analysis revealed highly conserved collinear regions that flank regions showing high variability and tandem duplicated genes. sequence annotation revealed that the majority of the orfs were members of multiple gene families. comparing potato to arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins suggested fragmented structural conservation between these distantly related plant species.
