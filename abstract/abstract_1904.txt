BACKGROUND
in our previous researches, we have found that apoptosis was induced in the medial prefrontal cortex  of post-traumatic stress disorder  rats. endoplasmic reticulum  stress-induced apoptosis has been implicated in the development of several disorder diseases. the aim of this study was to investigate whether endoplasmic reticulum-related pathway is involved in single-prolonged stress  induced apoptosis in the mpfc of ptsd rats by examining the expression levels of atf <dig> alpha , two important downstream molecular chaperones of atf6α in the er stress: glucose-regulated protein   <dig> and erp <dig>  and apoptotic factors caspase  <dig>  caspase  <dig>  and caspase  <dig> 


RESULTS
our results of morris water maze  test showed that after sps exposure, a striking increase of the escape latency was observed in sps rats at day  <dig> through day  <dig>  and sps rats had much less time spent in target quadrant compared to control rats . and from immunofluorescence assays, we found that there was a gradual increase on the protein expression of atf6α in response to sps, which indicated atf6α was activated by sps. and additionally, immunohistochemistry assays, western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  showed that the immunoreactivity, protein and mrna expression of grp <dig> and erp <dig> increased on  <dig>   <dig> days, and peaked on  <dig> days after sps exposure, which revealed that sps triggered inductions of grp <dig> and erp <dig> in the mpfc neurons. moreover, rt-pcr assays demonstrated that there were up-regulations in the transcripts levels of caspase  <dig>  caspase  <dig>  and caspase  <dig> in response to sps, which were according with the proteins changes of these apoptotic factors and indicated that er stress and the activation of caspases contributed to sps.


CONCLUSIONS
current data in this study highlight that sps induced atf6α-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress and er-related apoptosis in the mpfc neurons, which indicated that the endoplasmic reticulum pathway may be involved in ptsd-induced apoptosis.
