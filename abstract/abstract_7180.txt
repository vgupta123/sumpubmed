BACKGROUND
finding epistatic interactions in large association studies like genome-wide association studies  with the nowadays-available large volume of genomic data is a challenging and largely unsolved issue. few previous studies could handle genome-wide data due to the intractable difficulties met in searching a combinatorial explosive search space and statistically evaluating epistatic interactions given a limited number of samples. our work is a contribution to this field. we propose a novel approach combining k-nearest neighbors  and multi dimensional reduction  methods for detecting gene-gene interactions as a possible alternative to existing algorithms, e especially in situations where the number of involved determinants is high. after describing the approach, a comparison of our method  to a set of the other most performing methods  is carried on to detect interactions using simulated data as well as real genome-wide data.


RESULTS
experimental results on both simulated data and real genome-wide data show that knn-mdr has interesting properties in terms of accuracy and power, and that, in many cases, it significantly outperforms its recent competitors.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented methodology  is valuable in the context of loci and interactions mapping and can be seen as an interesting addition to the arsenal used in complex traits analyses.
