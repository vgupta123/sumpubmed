BACKGROUND
sugar beet  is an important crop for sugar and biomass production in temperate climate regions. currently sugar beets are sown in spring and harvested in autumn. autumn-sown sugar beets that are grown for a full year have been regarded as a cropping system to increase the productivity of sugar beet cultivation. however, for the development of these “winter beets” sufficient winter hardiness and a system for bolting control is needed. both require a thorough understanding of the underlying genetics and its natural variation.


RESULTS
we screened a diversity panel of  <dig> b. vulgaris accessions for three flowering time genes via ecotilling. this panel had been tested in the field for bolting behaviour and winter hardiness. ecotilling identified  <dig> silent snps and one non-synonymous snp within the genes btc <dig>  bvfl <dig> and bvft <dig>  resulting in  <dig> haplotypes. further, we detected associations of nucleotide polymorphisms in bvfl <dig> with bolting before winter as well as winter hardiness.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide the first genetic indication for the function of the flc homolog bvfl <dig> in beet. further, it demonstrates for the first time that ecotilling is a powerful method for exploring genetic diversity and allele mining in b. vulgaris.
