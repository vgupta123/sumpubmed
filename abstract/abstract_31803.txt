BACKGROUND
in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the conserved ins/igf- <dig> signaling pathway regulates many biological processes including life span, stress response, dauer diapause and metabolism. detection of differentially expressed genes may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism by which the ins/igf- <dig> signaling pathway regulates these processes. appropriate normalization is an essential prerequisite for obtaining accurate and reproducible quantification of gene expression levels. the aim of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for gene expression analysis in c. elegans.


RESULTS
real-time quantitative pcr was used to evaluate the expression stability of  <dig> candidate reference genes  in wild-type, three ins/igf- <dig> pathway mutants, dauers and l <dig> stage larvae. after genorm analysis, cdc- <dig>  pmp- <dig> and y45f10d. <dig> showed the most stable expression pattern and were used to normalize  <dig> sod expression levels. significant differences in mrna levels were observed for sod- <dig> and sod- <dig> in daf- <dig> relative to wild-type animals, whereas in dauers sod- <dig>  sod- <dig>  sod- <dig> and sod- <dig> are differentially expressed relative to third stage larvae.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings emphasize the importance of accurate normalization using stably expressed reference genes. the methodology used in this study is generally applicable to reliably quantify gene expression levels in the nematode c. elegans using quantitative pcr.
