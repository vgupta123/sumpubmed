BACKGROUND
successful inhibition of alloimmune activation in organ transplantation remains one of the key events in achieving a long-term graft survival. since t lymphocytes are largely responsible for alloimmune activation, targeted gene transfer of gene of cyclin kinase inhibitor p <dig> into t cells might inhibit their aberrant proliferation. a number of strategies using either adenoviral or lentiviral vectors linked to mono or bispecific antibodies directed against t cell surface markers/cytokines did not yield the desired results. therefore, this study was designed to test if a cd3promoter-p <dig> chimeric construct would in vitro and in vivo transfer p <dig> gene to t lymphocytes and result in inhibition of proliferation. cd <dig> promoter-p <dig> chimeric constructs were prepared with p <dig> in the sense and antisense orientation. for in vitro studies el4-il- <dig> thyoma cells were used and for in vivo studies cd3p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna was injected intramuscularly in mice. lymphocyte proliferation was quantified by 3h-thymidine uptake assay; il- <dig> mrna expression was studied by rt-pcr and using real time pcr assay, we monitored the cd <dig>  p <dig>  tnf-α and ifn-γ mrna expression.


RESULTS
transfection of cd3p <dig> sense and antisense in mouse thyoma cell line  resulted in modulation of mitogen-induced proliferation. the intramuscular injection of cd3p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna into mice also modulated lymphocyte proliferation and mrna expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate a novel strategy of in vitro and in vivo transfer of p <dig> gene to t cells using cd3-promoter to achieve targeted inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and immune activation.
