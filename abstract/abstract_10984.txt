BACKGROUND
cpg islands are important regions in dna. they usually appear at the 5â€™ end of genes containing gc-rich dinucleotides. when dna methylation occurs, gene regulation is affected and it sometimes leads to carcinogenesis. we propose a new detection program using a hidden-markov model alongside the viterbi algorithm.

methods
our solution provides a graphical user interface not seen in many of the other cgi detection programs and we unify the detection and analysis under one program to allow researchers to scan a genetic sequence, detect the significant cgis, and analyze the sequence once the scan is complete for any noteworthy findings.


RESULTS
using human chromosome  <dig>  we show that our algorithm finds a significant number of cgis. running an analysis on a dataset of promoters discovered that the characteristics of methylated and unmethylated cgis are significantly different. finally, we detected significantly different motifs between methylated and unmethylated cgi promoters using meme and mast.


CONCLUSIONS
developing this new tool for the community using powerful algorithms has shown that combining analysis with cgi detection will improve the continued research within the field of epigenetics.
