BACKGROUND
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing  can locate transcription factor binding sites on genomic scale. although many models and programs are available to call peaks, none has dominated its competition in comparison studies.


RESULTS
we propose a rigorous statistical model, the normal-exponential two-peak  model, which parallels the physical processes generating the empirical data, and which can naturally incorporate mappability information. the model therefore estimates total strength of binding ; it also assigns an error to an estimated binding location. the comparison study with existing programs on real chip-seq datasets  demonstrates that the next-peak model performs well both in calling peaks and locating them. the model also provides a goodness-of-fit test, to screen out spurious peaks and to infer multiple binding events in a region.


CONCLUSIONS
the next-peak program calls peaks on any test dataset about as accurately as any other, but provides unusual accuracy in the estimated location of the peaks it calls. next-peak is based on rigorous statistics, so its model also provides a principled foundation for a more elaborate statistical analysis of chip-seq data.
