BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and characterization of listeria species and listeria monocytogenes isolated from raw fish and open-air fish market environments. eight hundred and sixty two samples including raw fish and fish market environments  were collected from the open-air fish markets in the northern region of iran.


RESULTS
listeria spp. was isolated from 104/ <dig>  raw fish and 29/ <dig>  of samples from open-air fish market environment. the isolates of listeria spp. included l. innocua , l. monocytogenes , l. seeligeri , and l. ivanovii . of the 43 l. monocytogenes isolates,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  belonged to serovars 1/2a, 4b, and 1/2b, respectively. the inla, inlb, inlc, inlj, acta, hlya, iap, plca, and prfa virulence-associated genes were detected in almost all of the l. monocytogenes isolates. the listeria spp. isolates showed high resistance against tetracycline , penicillin g, and cephalothin . besides, we observed significant resistance level to tetracycline , ampicillin , cephalothin, penicillin g, and streptomycin  in the l. monocytogenes isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime, gentamicin, kanamycin, and pefloxacin. we found that tetm , teta , ampc , and pena  were the most prevalent antibiotic resistance genes in the l. monocytogenes isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
recovery of potentially pathogenic l. monocytogenes from raw fish and environment of open-air fish market samples in this study is a convincing evidence for the zoonotic potential of listeriosis.
