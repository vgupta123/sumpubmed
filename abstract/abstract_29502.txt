BACKGROUND
micrornas have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression in various biological processes. to investigate the function of mirnas in chicken ovarian development and folliculogenesis, two small rna libraries constructed from sexually mature  and immature  ovary tissues of single comb white leghorn chicken were sequenced using illumina small rna deep sequencing.


RESULTS
in the present study,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from sexually mature  and sexually immature  ovaries, respectively. in total,  <dig> known mirnas were identified, and  <dig> of them were found to be significantly differentially expressed:  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated in the mature ovary compared to the immature ovary. among the up-regulated mirnas, gga-mir-1a has the largest fold-change , while gga-mir- <dig> has the largest fold-change  among the down-regulated mirnas. the three most abundant mirnas in the chicken ovary are gga-mir-10a, gga-let- <dig> and gga-mir- <dig>  five differentially expressed mirnas  were validated by real-time quantitative rt-pcr . furthermore, the expression patterns of the five mirnas were analyzed in different developmental stages of chicken ovary and follicles of various sizes.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides the first mirna profile in sexually immature and mature chicken ovaries. some mirnas such as gga-mir-1a and gga-mir-21are expressed differentially in immature and mature chicken ovaries as well as among different sized follicles, suggesting an important role in the follicular growth or ovulation mechanism in the chicken.
