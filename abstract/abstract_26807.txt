BACKGROUND
our previous studies revealed that a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome  is associated with specific streptococcus suis serotype  <dig>  strains. to achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of ss <dig> at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> ss <dig> strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using nimblegen tiling arrays.


RESULTS
our results demonstrate that ss <dig> isolates have highly divergent genomes. the 89k pathogenicity island , which has been previously recognized as unique to the chinese epidemic strains causing stss, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. the abc-type transport systems, encoded by 89k, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of stss. moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as plcr, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator revs and ctsr. on the basis of analysis of regions of differences  across the entire genome for the  <dig> selected ss <dig> strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is proposed, which provides clues into streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89k pai present in the genome of ss <dig> strains revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to stss, which may lead to better environmental monitoring of epidemic ss <dig> strains.
