BACKGROUND
cassava , a starchy root crop grown in tropical and subtropical climates, is the sixth most important crop in the world after wheat, rice, maize, potato and barley. the repertoire of simple sequence repeat  markers for cassava is limited and warrants a need for a larger number of polymorphic ssrs for germplasm characterization and breeding applications.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> putative microsatellites were identified in silico from an  <dig>  cassava unigene set with an average density of one ssr every  <dig> kb. one hundred and ninety-two candidate ssrs were screened for polymorphism among a panel of cassava cultivars from africa, latin america and asia, four wild manihot species as well as two other important taxa in the euphorbiaceae, leafy spurge  and castor bean . of  <dig> markers with clean amplification products,  <dig>  displayed polymorphism based on high resolution agarose gels. of  <dig> est-ssr markers screened,  <dig>  amplified alleles from one or more wild species  whereas  <dig>  amplified alleles from castor bean and  <dig>  amplified alleles from leafy spurge; hence nearly all markers were transferable to wild relatives of m esculenta while only a fraction was transferable to the more distantly related taxa. in a subset of  <dig> est-ssrs assessed by fluorescence-based genotyping the number of alleles per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  per locus. these markers had a polymorphism information content  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig>  and showed genetic relationships consistent with existing information on these genotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
a set of  <dig> new, unique polymorphic est-ssrs was developed and characterized which extends the repertoire of ssr markers for cultivated cassava and its wild relatives. the markers show high pic values and therefore will be useful for cultivar identification, taxonomic studies, and genetic mapping. the study further shows that mining ests is a highly efficient strategy for polymorphism detection within the cultivated cassava gene pool.
