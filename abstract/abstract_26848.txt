BACKGROUND
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is the most common genetic disorder leading to end-stage renal failure in humans. in the pkd/mhm rat model of adpkd, the point mutation r823w in the sterile alpha motif  domain of the protein anks <dig> is responsible for disease. sam domains are known protein-protein interaction domains, capable of binding each other to form polymers and heterodimers. despite its physiological importance, little is known about the function of anks <dig> and how the r823w point mutation leads to pkd. recent work has revealed that anks <dig> interacts with a related protein called anks <dig>  both anks <dig> and anks <dig> have a similar domain structure, with ankyrin repeats at the n-terminus and a sam domain at the c-terminus.


RESULTS
the sam domain of anks <dig> is identified as a direct binding partner of the anks <dig> sam domain. we find that anks3-sam polymerizes and anks6-sam can bind to one end of the polymer. we present crystal structures of both the anks3-sam polymer and the anks3-sam/anks6-sam complex, revealing the molecular details of their association. we also learn how the r823w mutation disrupts anks <dig> function by dramatically destabilizing the sam domain such that the interaction with anks3-sam is lost.


CONCLUSIONS
anks <dig> is a direct interacting partner of anks <dig>  by structurally and biochemically characterizing the interaction between the anks <dig> and anks <dig> sam domains, our work provides a basis for future investigation of how the interaction between these proteins mediates kidney function.
