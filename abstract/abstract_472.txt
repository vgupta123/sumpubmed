BACKGROUND
neuronal migration is a crucial process that allows neurons to reach their correct target location to allow the nervous system to function properly. ap-2α is a transcription factor essential for neural crest cell migration and its mutation results in apoptosis within this cell population, as demonstrated by genetic models.


RESULTS
we down-modulated ap-2α expression in gn- <dig> neurons by rna interference and observe reduced neuron migration following the activation of a specific genetic programme including the adhesion related kinase  gene. we prove that axl is able to coordinate migration per se and by chip and promoter analysis we observe that its transcription is directly driven by ap-2α via the binding to one or more functional ap-2α binding sites present in its regulatory region. analysis of migration in ap-2α null mouse embryo fibroblasts also reveals an essential role for ap-2α in cell movement via the activation of a distinct genetic programme.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that ap-2α plays an essential role in cell movement via the activation of cell-specific genetic programmes. moreover, we demonstrate that the ap-2α regulated gene axl is an essential player in gn- <dig> neuron migration.
