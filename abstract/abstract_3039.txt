BACKGROUND
design of tumour specific immunotherapies using the patients' own dendritic cells  is a fast advancing scientific field. the functional qualities of the dc generated in vitro are critical, and today's gold standard for maturation is a cytokine cocktail consisting of il-1β, il- <dig>  tnf-α and pge <dig> generating cells lacking il-12p <dig> production. ok <dig> is an immunotherapeutic agent derived from killed streptococcus pyogenes that has been used clinically to treat malignant and benign neoplasms for decades.

methods
in this study, we analysed the effects of ok <dig> on dc maturation, dc migration, cytokine and chemokine secretion as well as t-cell stimulatory capacity, and compared it to the cytokine cocktail alone and combinations of ok <dig> with the cytokine cocktail.


RESULTS
ok <dig> induced a marked up-regulation of cd <dig> on the cell surface as well as a strong inflammatory response from the dc with significantly more secretion of  <dig> different cytokines and chemokines compared to the cytokine cocktail. interestingly, secretion of il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> was detected at high concentrations after maturation of dc with ok <dig>  however, the ok <dig> treated dc did not migrate as well as dc treated with cytokine cocktail in a transwell migration assay. during allogeneic t-cell stimulation ok <dig> treated dc induced proliferation of over  <dig> percent of cd <dig> and  <dig> percent of cd <dig> t-cells for more than two cell divisions, whereas cytokine cocktail treated dc induced proliferation of  <dig> and  <dig> percent of cd <dig> and cd <dig> t-cells, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the clinically approved compound ok <dig> has interesting properties that warrants its use in dc immunotherapy and should be considered as a potential immunomodulating agent in cancer immunotherapy.
