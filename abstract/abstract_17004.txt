BACKGROUND
genomic imprinting occurs in both marsupial and eutherian mammals. the cdkn1c and igf <dig> genes are both imprinted and syntenic in the mouse and human, but in marsupials only igf <dig> is imprinted. this study examines the evolution of features that, in eutherians, regulate cdkn1c imprinting.


RESULTS
despite the absence of imprinting, cdkn1c protein was present in the tammar wallaby placenta. genomic analysis of the tammar region confirmed that cdkn1c is syntenic with igf <dig>  however, there are fewer ltr and dna elements in the region and in intron  <dig> of kcnq <dig>  in addition there are fewer lines in the tammar compared with human and mouse. while the cpg island in intron  <dig> of kcnq <dig> and promoter elements could not be detected, the antisense transcript kcnq1ot <dig> that regulates cdkn1c imprinting in human and mouse is still expressed.


CONCLUSIONS
cdkn1c has a conserved function, likely antagonistic to igf <dig>  in the mammalian placenta that preceded its acquisition of imprinting. cdkn1c resides in synteny with igf <dig>  demonstrating that imprinting of the two genes did not occur concurrently to balance maternal and paternal influences on the growth of the placenta. the expression of kcnq1ot <dig> in the absence of cdkn1c imprinting suggests that antisense transcription at this locus preceded imprinting of this domain. these findings demonstrate the stepwise accumulation of control mechanisms within imprinted domains and show that cdkn1c imprinting cannot be due to its synteny with igf <dig> or with its placental expression in mammals.
