BACKGROUND
sunflower downy mildew is a major disease caused by the obligatory biotrophic oomycete plasmopara halstedii. little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity. in this study we used a genomics approach to gain a first insight into the transcriptome of p. halstedii.


RESULTS
to identify genes from the obligatory biotrophic oomycete plasmopara halstedii that are expressed during infection in sunflower  we employed the suppression subtraction hybridization  method from sunflower seedlings infected by p. halstedii. using this method and random sequencing of clones, a total of  <dig> expressed sequence tags  corresponding to  <dig> unique sequence sets were identified. to determine the origin of the unisequences, pcr primers were designed to amplify these gene fragments from genomic dna isolated either from p. halstedii sporangia or from helianthus annuus. only  <dig> nonredundant ests which correspond to a total of  <dig> ests  proved to be derived from p. halstedii genes and that are expressed during infection in sunflower. a set of  <dig> nonredundant sequences were identified as showing matches to sequences deposited in public databases. nevertheless, about 7% of the ests seem to be unique to p. halstedii without any homolog in any public database.


CONCLUSIONS
a summary of the assignment of nonredundant ests to functional categories as well as their relative abundance is listed and discussed. annotation of the ests revealed a number of genes that could function in virulence. we provide a first glimpse into the gene content of p. halstedii. these resources should accelerate research on this important pathogen.
