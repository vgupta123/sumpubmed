BACKGROUND
biliary atresia is a fibroinflammatory obstruction of extrahepatic bile duct that leads to end-stage liver disease in children. despite advances in understanding the pathogenesis of biliary atresia, very little is known about the role of micrornas  in onset and progression of the disease. in this study, we aimed to investigate the entire biliary transcriptome to identify mirnas with potential role in the pathogenesis of bile duct obstruction.


RESULTS
by profiling the expression levels of mirna in extrahepatic bile ducts and gallbladder  from a murine model of biliary atresia, we identified  <dig> mirnas whose expression was suppressed at the times of duct obstruction and atresia . next, we obtained  <dig>  putative target genes of the  <dig> mirnas using in silico target prediction algorithms. by integrating this result with a genome-wide gene expression analysis of the same tissue , we identified  <dig> potential target genes with coordinate expression by the  <dig> mirnas. functional analysis of these target genes revealed a significant relevance of mir-30b/c, -133a/b, - <dig>  -200a, - <dig> and − <dig> based on increases in expression of at least  <dig> target genes in the same tissue and 1st-to-3rd tier links with genes and gene-groups regulating organogenesis and immune response. these mirnas showed higher expression in ehbds above livers, a unique expression in cholangiocytes and the subepithelial compartment, and were downregulated in a cholangiocyte cell line after rrv infection.


CONCLUSIONS
integrative genomics reveals functional relevance of mir-30b/c, -133a/b, - <dig>  -200a, - <dig> and − <dig>  the coordinate expression of mirnas and target genes in a temporal-spatial fashion suggests a regulatory role of these mirnas in pathogenesis of experimental biliary atresia.
