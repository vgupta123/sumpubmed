BACKGROUND
bioimage classification is a fundamental problem for many important biological studies that require accurate cell phenotype recognition, subcellular localization, and histopathological classification. in this paper, we present a new bioimage classification method that can be generally applicable to a wide variety of classification problems. we propose to use a high-dimensional multi-modal descriptor that combines multiple texture features. we also design a novel subcategory discriminant transform  algorithm to further enhance the discriminative power of descriptors by learning convolution kernels to reduce the within-class variation and increase the between-class difference.


RESULTS
we evaluate our method on eight different bioimage classification tasks using the publicly available iicbu  <dig> database. each task comprises a separate dataset, and the collection represents typical subcellular, cellular, and tissue level classification problems. our method demonstrates improved classification accuracy  on six tasks when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. we also find that sdt outperforms the well-known dimension reduction techniques, with for example  <dig>  to 13% improvement over linear discriminant analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a general bioimage classification method, which comprises a highly descriptive visual feature representation and a learning-based discriminative feature transformation algorithm. our evaluation on the iicbu  <dig> database demonstrates improved performance over the state-of-the-art for six different classification tasks.
