BACKGROUND
the involvement of small rnas in cotton fiber development is under explored. the objective of this work was to directly clone, annotate, and analyze small rnas of developing ovules to reveal the candidate small interfering rna/micrornas involved in cotton ovule and fiber development.


RESULTS
we cloned small rna sequences from 0â€“ <dig> days post anthesis  developing cotton ovules. a total of  <dig> individual colonies were sequenced from  <dig> ovule small rna libraries that yielded  <dig> candidate small rnas with a total of  <dig> unique sequence signatures. the majority  of these  <dig> sequences were  <dig> nt long with an additional  <dig> sequences  in the  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt size range. among all small rna sequence signatures only three mirbase-confirmed plant micrornas  were identified and only two mirna-containing clones were recovered beyond  <dig> dpa. further, among all of the small rna sequences obtained from the small rna pools in developing ovules, only  <dig> groups of sequences were observed in more than one dpa period. of these, only five were present in more than two dpa periods. two of these were mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and a third was identified as  <dig> s rrna sequence. thus, the vast majority of sequence signatures were expressed in only one dpa period and this included nearly all of the  <dig> nt sequences. finally, we observed a distinct dpa-specific expression pattern among our clones based upon sequence abundance. sequences occurring only once were far more likely to be seen in the  <dig> to  <dig> dpa periods while those occurring five or more times were the majority in later periods.


CONCLUSIONS
this initial survey of small rna sequences present in developing ovules in cotton indicates that fiber development is under complex small rna regulation. taken together, the results of this initial small rna screen of developing cotton ovules is most consistent with a model, proposed by baulcombe, that there are networks of small rnas that are induced in a cascade fashion by the action of mirnas and that the nature of these cascades can change from tissue to tissue and developmental stage to developmental stage.
