BACKGROUND
the nuclear dna is conventionally used to assess the diversity and relatedness among different species, but variations at the dna genome level has also been used to study the relationship among different organisms. in most species, mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are inherited maternally; therefore it is anticipated that organelle dna remains completely associated. many research studies were conducted simultaneously on organelle genome. the objectives of this study was to analyze the genetic relationship between chloroplast and mitochondrial dna in three chinese prunus genotypes viz., prunus persica, prunus domestica, and prunus avium.


RESULTS
we investigated the genetic diversity of prunus genotypes using simple sequence repeat  markers relevant to the chloroplast and mitochondria. most of the genotypes were genetically similar as revealed by phylogenetic analysis. the y <dig> wu xing  and l <dig> hong xin li  genotypes have a high similarity index , followed by zi ye li , whereas; l <dig> tai yang li  has the lowest genetic similarity . in case of cpssr, hong tao  and l <dig> tai yang li  genotypes demonstrated similarity index of  <dig>  and huang tao has the lowest similarity index of  <dig> . the mtssr nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that each genotype has similar amplicon length  except m5y <dig> i.e., 505 bp with ccb <dig> primer; while in case of nad <dig> primer, all genotypes showed different sizes. the meho , mey <dig> , mel <dig>  and mel <dig>  have 586 bps; while mey <dig> , mezi  and mehu  have  <dig>   <dig> and 566 bp, respectively. the ccb <dig> primer showed highly conserved sequences and minute single polymorphic nucleotides with no deletion or mutation. the cpssr  microsatellites showed the harmonious amplicon length. the czi , cho  and cl <dig>  showed 182 bp; whilechu , cy <dig> , cl <dig>  and cy <dig>  showed 181 bp amplicon lengths.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrated high conservation in chloroplast and mitochondrial genome among prunus species during the evolutionary process. these findings are valuable to study the organelle dna diversity in different species and genotypes of prunus to provide in depth insight in to the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes.
