BACKGROUND
sexual selection theory predicts that males are limited in their reproductive success by access to mates, whereas females are more limited by resources. in animal-pollinated plants, attraction of pollinators and successful pollination is crucial for reproductive success. in dioecious plant species, males should thus be selected to increase their attractiveness to pollinators by investing more than females in floral traits that enhance pollinator visitation. we tested the prediction of higher attractiveness of male flowers in the dioecious, moth-pollinated herb silene latifolia, by investigating floral signals  and conducting behavioral experiments with the pollinator-moth, hadena bicruris.


RESULTS
as found in previous studies, male plants produced more but smaller flowers. male flowers, however, emitted significantly larger amounts of scent than female flowers, especially of the pollinator-attracting compounds. in behavioral tests we showed that na√Øve pollinator-moths preferred male over female flowers, but this preference was only significant for male moths.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest the evolution of dimorphic floral signals is shaped by sexual selection and pollinator preferences, causing sexual conflict in both plants and pollinators.
