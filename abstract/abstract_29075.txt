BACKGROUND
zunongwangia profunda sm-a <dig>  which was isolated from deep-sea sediment, is an aerobic, gram-negative bacterium that represents a new genus of flavobacteriaceae. this is the first sequenced genome of a deep-sea bacterium from the phylum bacteroidetes.


RESULTS
the z. profunda sm-a <dig> genome has a single  <dig>  <dig> 187-bp circular chromosome with no extrachromosomal elements and harbors  <dig>  <dig> predicted protein-coding genes. sm-a <dig> produces a large amount of capsular polysaccharides and possesses two polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters. it has a total of  <dig> peptidases,  <dig> of which have signal peptides. in addition to extracellular peptidases, sm-a <dig> also has various extracellular enzymes for carbohydrate, lipid and dna degradation. these extracellular enzymes suggest that the bacterium is able to hydrolyze organic materials in the sediment, especially carbohydrates and proteinaceous organic nitrogen. there are two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats in the genome, but their spacers do not match any sequences in the public sequence databases. sm-a <dig> is a moderate halophile. our protein isoelectric point analysis indicates that extracellular proteins have lower predicted isoelectric points than intracellular proteins. sm-a <dig> accumulates organic osmolytes in the cell, so its extracelluar proteins are more halophilic than its intracellular proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we present the first complete genome of a deep-sea sedimentary bacterium from the phylum bacteroidetes. the genome analysis shows that sm-a <dig> has some common features of deep-sea bacteria, as well as an important capacity to hydrolyze sedimentary organic nitrogen.
