BACKGROUND
mxd <dig> is a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper transcription factor involved in cellular proliferation. in previous studies we demonstrated that knock-down of mxd <dig> in the human medulloblastoma cell line daoy resulted in decreased proliferation. surprisingly, overexpression of mxd <dig> in daoy cells also decreased proliferation and increased cell death, suggesting that persistent expression of mxd <dig> triggers an apoptotic response, perhaps as a fail-safe mechanism. to investigate this apparent paradox in detail we developed a tamoxifen inducible system to analyze the temporal effects of mxd <dig> in the proliferation and transcriptional response of daoy cells upon acute induction compared with long-term expression of mxd <dig> 


RESULTS
we find that acute induction of mxd <dig> initially promotes cell cycle progression as assessed by a transient increase in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. however, persistent induction of mxd <dig> ultimately results in decreased proliferation based on cell counts. finally, with microarray expression profiling and gene ontology analysis we identify several major pathways enriched in response to acute  versus persistent  mxd <dig> activation.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrate that acute mxd <dig> activation results in a transient increase in cell proliferation while persistent activation of mxd <dig> eventually results in an overall decrease in cell number, suggesting that the time course of mxd <dig> expression dictates the cellular outcome. microarray expression profiling and gene ontology analysis indicate that mxd <dig> regulates distinct genes and pathways upon acute induction compared with persistent expression, suggesting that the cellular outcome is specified by changes in mxd <dig> transcriptional program in a time-dependent manner.
