BACKGROUND
in plants, the 5 s rrna genes usually occur as separate tandems  or, less commonly, linked to 35 s rdna units . the activity of linked genes remains unknown so far. we studied the homogeneity and expression of 5 s genes in several species from family asteraceae known to contain linked 35 s-5 s units. additionally, their methylation status was determined using bisulfite sequencing. fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to reveal the sub-nuclear positions of rdna arrays.


RESULTS
we found that homogenization of l-type units went to completion in most  but not all species. two species contained major l-type and minor s-type units . the linked genes dominate 5 s rdna expression while the separate tandems do not seem to be expressed. members of tribe anthemideae evolved functional variants of the polymerase iii promoter in which a residing c-box element differs from the canonical angiosperm motif by as much as 30%. on this basis, a more relaxed consensus sequence of a plant c-box:  is proposed. the 5 s paralogs display heavy dna methylation similarly as to their unlinked counterparts. fish revealed the close association of 35 s-5 s arrays with nucleolar periphery indicating that transcription of 5 s genes may occur in this territory.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that the unusual linked arrangement of 5 s genes, occurring in several plant species, is fully compatible with their expression and functionality. this extraordinary 5 s gene dynamics is manifested at different levels, such as variation in intrachromosomal positions, unit structure, epigenetic modification and considerable divergence of regulatory motifs.
