BACKGROUND
5-hydroxytryptamine  is one of the key neuromodulators in mammalian brain, but many fundamental properties of serotonergic neurones and  <dig> ht release remain unknown. the objective of this study was to generate an adenoviral vector system for selective targeting of serotonergic neurones and apply it to study quantal characteristics of  <dig> ht release in the rat brain.


RESULTS
we have generated adenoviral vectors which incorporate a  <dig>  kb fragment of the rat tryptophan hydroxylase- <dig>  gene which selectively  target raphe serotonergic neurones. in order to enhance the level of expression a two-step transcriptional amplification strategy was employed. this allowed direct visualization of serotonergic neurones by egfp fluorescence. using these vectors we have performed initial characterization of egfp-expressing serotonergic neurones in rat organotypic brain slice cultures. fluorescent serotonergic neurones were identified and studied using patch clamp and confocal ca2+ imaging and had features consistent with those previously reported using post-hoc identification approaches. fine processes of serotonergic neurones could also be visualized in un-fixed tissue and morphometric analysis suggested two putative types of axonal varicosities. we used micro-amperometry to analyse the quantal characteristics of  <dig> ht release and found that central  <dig> ht exocytosis occurs predominantly in quanta of ~ <dig> molecules from varicosities and ~ <dig> molecules from cell bodies. in addition, in somata, we observed a minority of large release events discharging on average ~ <dig> molecules.


CONCLUSIONS
for the first time quantal release of  <dig> ht from somato-dendritic compartments and axonal varicosities in mammalian brain has been demonstrated directly and characterised. release from somato-dendritic and axonal compartments might have different physiological functions. novel vectors generated in this study open a host of new experimental opportunities and will greatly facilitate further studies of the central serotonergic system.
