BACKGROUND
the chicken eggshell is a natural mechanical barrier to protect egg components from physical damage and microbial penetration. its integrity and strength is critical for the development of the embryo or to ensure for consumers a table egg free of pathogens. this study compared global gene expression in laying hen uterus in the presence or absence of shell calcification in order to characterize gene products involved in the supply of minerals and / or the shell biomineralization process.


RESULTS
microarrays were used to identify a repertoire of  <dig> over-expressed genes during shell calcification. go terms enrichment was performed to provide a global interpretation of the functions of the over-expressed genes, and revealed that the most over-represented proteins are related to reproductive functions. our analysis identified  <dig> gene products encoding proteins involved in mineral supply, and allowed updating of the general model describing uterine ion transporters during eggshell calcification. a list of  <dig> proteins potentially secreted into the uterine fluid to be active in the mineralization process was also established. they were classified according to their potential functions .


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides detailed descriptions of genes and corresponding proteins over-expressed when the shell is mineralizing. some of these proteins involved in the supply of minerals and influencing the shell fabric to protect the egg contents are potentially useful biological markers for the genetic improvement of eggshell quality.
