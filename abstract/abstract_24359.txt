BACKGROUND
the human cervical cancer oncogene  has been isolated as a human oncoprotein, and has shown strong tumorigenic features. its potential role in tumorigenesis may result from a negative regulation of the p <dig> tumor suppressor gene.


RESULTS
to investigate the biological function of hccr- <dig> in the cell, we predicted biological features using bioinformatic tools, and have identified a letm <dig> homologous domain at position  <dig> to  <dig> of hccr- <dig>  this domain contains proteins identified from diverse species predicted to be mitochondrial proteins. fluorescence microscopy and fractionation experiments showed that hccr- <dig> is located in mitochondria in the cos- <dig>  mcf- <dig> and hek/ <dig> cell lines, and subcompartamentally at the outer membrane in the hek/ <dig> cell line. the topological structure was revealed as the nh2-terminus of hccr- <dig> oriented toward the cytoplasm. we also observed that the d1- <dig> region, at position  <dig> to  <dig> of hccr- <dig>  was required and sufficient for posttranslational mitochondrial import. the function of hccr- <dig> on mitochondrial membrane is to retard the intrinsic apoptosis induced by uvc and staurosporine, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our experiments show the biological features of hccr- <dig> in the cell, and suggest that uncontrolled expression of hccr- <dig> may cause mitochondrial dysfunction that can result in resisting the uvc or staurosporine-induced apoptosis and progressing in the tumor formation.
