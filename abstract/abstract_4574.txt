BACKGROUND
the addition of an acetyl group to protein n-termini is a widespread co-translational modification. natb is one of the main n-acetyltransferases that targets a subset of proteins possessing an n-terminal methionine, but so far only a handful of substrates have been reported. using a yeast nat3Δ strain, deficient for the catalytic subunit of natb, we employed a quantitative proteomics strategy to identify natb substrates and to characterize downstream effects in nat3Δ.


RESULTS
comparing by proteomics wt and nat3Δ strains, using metabolic 15n isotope labeling, we confidently identified  <dig> natb substrates, out of a total of  <dig> detected acetylated protein n-termini. we acquired in-depth proteome wide measurements of expression levels of about  <dig> proteins. most remarkably, natb deletion led to a very significant change in protein phosphorylation.


CONCLUSIONS
protein expression levels change only marginally in between wt and nat3Δ. a comparison of the detected natb substrates with their orthologous revealed remarkably little conservation throughout the phylogenetic tree. we further present evidence of post-translational n-acetylation on protein variants at non-annotated n-termini. moreover, analysis of downstream effects in nat3Δ revealed elevated protein phosphorylation levels whereby the kinase snf1p is likely a key element in this process.
