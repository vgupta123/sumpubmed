BACKGROUND
the lymphatic system complements the blood circulatory system in absorption and transport of nutrients, and in the maintenance of homeostasis. angiopoietins  <dig> and  <dig>  are regulators of both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis through the tek/tie- <dig> receptor tyrosine kinase. the response of endothelial cells to stimulation with either ang <dig> or ang <dig> is thought to be dependent upon the origin of the endothelial cells. in this study, we examined the effects of the angiopoietins on lymphatic, venous and arterial primary endothelial cells , which were isolated and cultured from bovine mesenteric vessels.


RESULTS
bmlec, bmvec and bmaec cell populations all express tie- <dig> and were shown to express the appropriate cellular markers prox- <dig>  vegfr <dig>  and neuropilin- <dig> that define the particular origin of each preparation. we showed that while bmlecs responded slightly more readily to angiopoietin- <dig>  stimulation, bmvecs and bmaecs were more sensitive to ang <dig> stimulation. furthermore, exposure of bmlecs to ang <dig> induced marginally higher levels of proliferation and survival than did exposure to ang <dig>  however, exposure to ang <dig> resulted in higher levels of migration in bmlecs than did to ang <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that although both ang <dig> and ang <dig> can activate the tie- <dig> receptor in bmlecs, ang <dig> and ang <dig> may have distinct roles in mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells.
