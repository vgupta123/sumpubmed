BACKGROUND
we have studied sperm structure and motility in a eusocial rodent where reproduction is typically restricted to a single male and behaviourally dominant queen. males rarely compete for access to the queen during her estrus cycle, suggesting little or no role for sperm competition.


RESULTS
our results revealed an atypical mammalian sperm structure with spermatozoa from breeding, subordinate and disperser males being degenerate and almost completely lacking a "mammalian phylogenetic stamp". sperm structure is characterized by extreme polymorphism with most spermatozoa classified as abnormal. sperm head shapes include round, oval, elongated, lobed, asymmetrical and amorphous. at the ultrastructural level, the sperm head contains condensed to granular chromatin with large open spaces between the chromatin. nuclear chromatin seems disorganized since chromatin condensation is irregular and extremely inconsistent. the acrosome forms a cap  over the anterior part of the head. a well defined nuclear fossa and neck with five minor sets of banded protein structures are present. the midpiece is poorly organized and contains only  <dig> to  <dig> round to oval mitochondria. the flagellar pattern is 9+9+ <dig>  a distinct degenerative feature of the tail principal piece is the absence of the fibrous sheath. only 7% motile spermatozoa were observed which had exceptionally slow swimming speeds.


CONCLUSIONS
in this species, sperm form has simplified and degenerated in many aspects and represents a specialised form of degenerative orthogenesis at the cellular level.
