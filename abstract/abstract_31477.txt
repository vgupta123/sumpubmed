BACKGROUND
x-linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is a disorder characterized by abnormal development of tissues and organs of ectodermal origin caused by mutations in the eda gene. the bovine eda gene encodes the ectodysplasin a, a membrane protein expressed in keratinocytes, hair follicles and sweat glands, which is involved in the interactions between cell and cell and/or cell and matrix. four mutations causing ectodermal dysplasia in cattle have been described so far.


RESULTS
we identified a new single nucleotide polymorphism  at the 9th base of exon  <dig> in the eda gene in two calves of holstein friesian cattle breed affected by ectodermal dysplasia. this snp is located in the exonic splicing enhancer  recognized by srp <dig> protein. as a consequence, the spliceosome machinery is no longer able to recognize the sequence as exonic and causes exon skipping. the mutation determines the deletion of the entire exon  in the rna processing, causing a severe alteration of the protein structure and thus the disease.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a mutation, never described before, that changes the regulation of alternative splicing in the eda gene and causes ectodermal dysplasia in cattle. the analysis of the snp allows the identification of carriers that can transmit the disease to the offspring. this mutation can thus be exploited for a rational and efficient selection of unequivocally healthy cows for breeding.
