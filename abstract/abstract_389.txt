BACKGROUND
cancer has remarkable complexity at the molecular level, with multiple genes, proteins, pathways and regulatory interconnections being affected. we introduce a systems biology approach to study cancer that formally integrates the available genetic, transcriptomic, epigenetic and molecular knowledge on cancer biology and, as a proof of concept, we apply it to colorectal cancer.


RESULTS
we first classified all the genes in the human genome into cancer-associated and non-cancer-associated genes based on extensive literature mining. we then selected a set of functional attributes proven to be highly relevant to cancer biology that includes protein kinases, secreted proteins, transcription factors, post-translational modifications of proteins, dna methylation and tissue specificity. these cancer-associated genes were used to extract 'common cancer fingerprints' through these molecular attributes, and a boolean logic was implemented in such a way that both the expression data and functional attributes could be rationally integrated, allowing for the generation of a guilt-by-association algorithm to identify novel cancer-associated genes. finally, these candidate genes are interlaced with the known cancer-related genes in a network analysis aimed at identifying highly conserved gene interactions that impact cancer outcome. we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using colorectal cancer as a test case and identify several novel candidate genes that are classified according to their functional attributes. these genes include the following: 1) secreted proteins as potential biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal cancer ; 2) kinases as potential drug candidates to prevent tumor growth ; and 3) potential oncogenic transcription factors .


CONCLUSIONS
we argue that this is a holistic approach that faithfully mimics cancer characteristics, efficiently predicts novel cancer-associated genes and has universal applicability to the study and advancement of cancer research.
