BACKGROUND
we performed large-scale bacterial artificial chromosome  end-sequencing of two bac libraries  and conducted an in silico analysis to characterize the obtained sequence data, to make them a useful resource for genomic research on the silkworm .


RESULTS
more than  <dig> bac end sequences , comprising more than  <dig> mbp and covering about  <dig> % of the silkworm genome, were sequenced. repeat-sequence analysis with known repeat sequences indicated that the long interspersed nuclear elements  were abundant in bamhi bess, whereas dna-type elements were abundant in ecori bess. repeat-sequence analysis revealed that the abundance of lines might be due to a gc bias of the restriction sites and that the gc content of silkworm lines was higher than that of mammalian lines. in a blast-based sequence analysis of the bess against two available whole-genome shotgun sequence data sets, more than 70% of the bess had a blast hit with an identity of ≥ 99%. about 14% of ecori bess and about 8% of bamhi bess were paired-end clones with unique sequences at both ends. cluster analysis of the bess clarified the proportion of bess containing protein-coding regions.


CONCLUSIONS
as a result of this characterization, the identified bess will be a valuable resource for genomic research on bombyx mori, for example, as a base for construction of a bac-based physical map. the use of multiple complementary bac libraries constructed with different restriction enzymes also makes the bess a more valuable genomic resource. the genbank accession numbers of the obtained end sequences are de283657–de <dig>
