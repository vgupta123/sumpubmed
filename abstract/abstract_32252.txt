BACKGROUND
the serotonin  2a and 2c receptors  are involved in a wide range of physiological and behavioral processes in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems. these receptors share a high degree of homology, have overlapping pharmacological profiles, and utilize many of the same and richly diverse second messenger signaling systems. we have developed quantitative assays for cells stably expressing these two receptors involving minimal cell sample manipulations that dramatically improve parallel assessments of two signaling responses: intracellular calcium  changes and activation  of downstream kinases. such profiles are needed to begin to understand the simultaneous contributions from the multiplicity of signaling cascades likely to be initiated by serotonergic ligands.


RESULTS
we optimized the cai++ assay for stable cell lines expressing either 5-ht2ar or 5-ht2cr . we adapted a quantitative 96-well plate immunoassay for perk in the same cell lines. similar cell density optima and time courses were observed for 5-ht2ar- and 5-ht2cr-expressing cells in generating both types of signaling. both cell lines also require serum-free preincubation for maximal agonist responses in the perk assay. however, 5-ht2ar-expressing cells showed significant release of cai++ in response to 5-ht stimulation even when preincubated in serum-replete medium, while the response was completely eliminated by serum in 5-ht2cr-expressing cells. response to another serotonergic ligand  was eliminated by serum-replete preincubation in both cells lines.


CONCLUSIONS
these data expand our knowledge of differences in ligand-stimulated signaling cascades between 5-ht2ar and 5-ht2cr. our parallel assays can be applied to other cell and receptor systems for monitoring and dissecting concurrent signaling responses.
