BACKGROUND
the prediction of biochemical function from the 3d structure of a protein has proved to be much more difficult than was originally foreseen. a reliable method to test the likelihood of putative annotations and to predict function from structure would add tremendous value to structural genomics data. we report on a new method, structurally aligned local sites of activity , for the prediction of biochemical function based on a local structural match at the predicted catalytic or binding site.


RESULTS
implementation of the salsa method is described. for the structural genomics protein py <dig>  from plasmodium yoelii, it is shown that the putative annotation, orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase , is most likely correct. salsa analysis of yp_ <dig>  , a putative sugar hydrolase from parabacteroides distasonis, shows that its active site does not bear close resemblance to any previously characterized member of its superfamily, the concanavalin a-like lectins/glucanases. it is noted that three residues in the active site of the thermophilic beta- <dig> -xylanase from nonomuraea flexuosa , y <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig>  overlap with pool-predicted residues of similar type, y <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig>  in yp_ <dig> . the substrate recognition regions of the two proteins are rather different, suggesting that yp_ <dig>  is a new functional type within the superfamily. a structural genomics protein from mycobacterium avium  has been reported to be an enoyl-coa hydratase , but salsa analysis shows a poor match between the predicted residues for the sg protein and those of known echs. a better local structural match is obtained with anabaena beta-diketone hydrolase , a known β-diketone hydrolase from cyanobacterium anabaena . this suggests that the reported ech function of the sg protein is incorrect and that it is more likely a β-diketone hydrolase.


CONCLUSIONS
a local site match provides a more compelling function prediction than that obtainable from a simple 3d structure match. the present method can confirm putative annotations, identify misannotation, and in some cases suggest a more probable annotation.
