BACKGROUND
faf <dig> is a ubiquitin-binding adaptor for the p <dig> atpase and belongs to the uba-ubx family of p <dig> cofactors. p <dig> converts the energy derived from atp hydrolysis into conformational changes of the p <dig> hexamer, which allows the dissociation of its targets from cellular structures or from larger protein complexes to facilitate their ubiquitin-dependent degradation. vapb and the related protein vapa form homo- and heterodimers that are anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and can interact with protein partners carrying a ffat motif. mutations in either vapb or p <dig> can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects upper and lower motor neurons.


RESULTS
we show that faf <dig> contains a non-canonical ffat motif that allows it to interact directly with the msp domain of vapb and, thereby, to mediate vapb interaction with p <dig>  this finding establishes a link between two proteins that can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis when mutated, vapb/als <dig> and p97/als <dig>  subsequently, we identified a similar ffat-like motif in the asna <dig> subunit of the transmembrane-domain recognition complex , which in turn mediates asna <dig> interaction with the msp domain of vapb.

proteasome inhibition leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated species in vapb immunoprecipitates and this correlates with an increase in faf <dig> and p <dig> binding. we found that vapb interaction with ubiquitinated proteins is strongly reduced in cells treated with faf <dig> sirna. our efforts to determine the identity of the ubiquitinated targets common to vapb and faf <dig> led to the identification of rpn <dig>  a subunit of an oligosaccharyl-transferase located at the endoplasmic reticulum, which may be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
the ffat-like motifs we identified in faf <dig> and asna <dig> demonstrate that sequences containing a single phenylalanine residue with the consensus fedax are also proficient to mediate interaction with vapb.

our findings indicate that the repertoire of vapb interactors is more diverse than previously anticipated and link vapb to the function of atpase complexes such as p97/faf <dig> and asna1/trc.
