BACKGROUND
sled dogs commonly suffer from diarrhea. although multiple etiologies exist there are limited field studies using synbiotics as a supplement to prevent or treat diarrhea. the objective of this study was to examine alterations in fecal quality, short-chain fatty acids , and the fecal microbiome in two groups of training sled dogs fed a synbiotic or microcrystalline cellulose placebo. twenty clinically healthy training sled dogs randomized into two cohorts  for a  <dig> week prospective study were examined. fecal ph and fecal short chain fatty acid  concentrations were measured and tag-encoded flx 16s rdna amplicon pyrosequencing  and quantitative real-time pcr were performed at baseline  and after  <dig> weeks of treatment with a total treatment time of  <dig> weeks. fecal scores for all dogs were assessed at baseline and every day for  <dig> wk after initiation of treatment.


RESULTS
alterations in the fecal microbiome were observed with a significant rise in lactobacillaceae in the synbiotic group  after  <dig> wk of treatment. a positive correlation was found between lactobacillaceae and overall butyrate concentration  in all dogs. after  <dig> wk of treatment, there was an improved fecal score and fewer days of diarrhea  in the dogs given synbiotic, which coincided with a presumed contagious outbreak shared by all dogs in the study.


CONCLUSIONS
use of this synbiotic results in an increase in presumed beneficial bacterial flora of the host colon which was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of diarrhea in training sled dogs.
