BACKGROUND
carbonic anhydrases  are physiologically important enzymes which participate in many gastrointestinal processes such as acid and bicarbonate secretion and metabolic pathways including gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis. the genomic data suggests that there are thirteen enzymatically active members of the mammalian ca isozyme family. in the present study, we systematically examined the mrna expression levels of all known ca isozymes by quantitative real-time pcr in eight tissues of the digestive system of male and female mice.


RESULTS
the cas expressed in all tissues were car5b, car <dig>  and car <dig>  among which car5b showed moderate and car <dig> and car <dig> extremely low expression levels. car <dig>  car <dig>  car <dig>  and car <dig> were detected in seven out of eight tissues and car <dig> and car <dig> were expressed in six tissues. importantly, car <dig>  car <dig>  and car <dig> showed very high expression levels in certain tissues as compared to the other cas, suggesting that these low activity isozymes may also participate in physiological processes other than ca catalysis and high expression levels are required to fulfil their functions in the body.


CONCLUSIONS
a comprehensive mrna expression profile of the  <dig> enzymatically active cas in the murine gastrointestinal tract was produced in the present study. it contributes to a deeper understanding of the distribution of ca isozymes and their potential roles in the mouse digestive system.
