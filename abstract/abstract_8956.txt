BACKGROUND
the distinctive coat pattern of a dalmatian is the result of the interaction of several loci. while the encoded function of these genes is not fully understood, it is known the piebald, ticking, and flecking loci interact to produce the dalmatian's classic pigmented spots on a white background. the color of the pigmented spots in purebred dalmatians can either be black or liver, but the locus responsible for color determination is unknown. studies have been conducted to determine the underlying genes involved in coat color determination in the dog, e.g., in the labrador retriever, but none to date have addressed black versus liver in the dalmatian.


RESULTS
a genome scan was conducted in a multi-generational kindred of dalmatians segregating black and liver spot color. linkage analysis was performed using a total of  <dig> polymorphic microsatellite markers from the kindred. linkage was found between spot color and a single microsatellite marker, fh <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the tyrp <dig>  locus is located at position  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  which is approximately  <dig>  mb from marker fh <dig>  given the recent characterization of tyrp <dig> genetic variations in the dog and the linkage evidence reported here, tyrp <dig> is likely responsible for the spot color variation of black versus liver seen in the dalmatian.
