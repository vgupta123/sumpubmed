BACKGROUND
meningiomas are the most common intracranial neoplasias, representing a clinically and histopathologically heterogeneous group of tumors. the neurofibromatosis type  <dig>  tumor suppressor is the only gene known to be frequently involved in early development of meningiomas. the objective of this study was to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors contributing to the development of these tumors. a large set of sporadic meningiomas were analyzed for presence of 22q macro-mutations using array-cgh in order to identify tumors carrying gene dosage aberrations not encompassing nf <dig>  the nf <dig> locus was also comprehensively studied for point mutations within coding and conserved non-coding sequences. furthermore, cpg methylation within the nf <dig> promoter region was thoroughly analyzed.


RESULTS
monosomy  <dig> was the predominant finding, detected in 47% of meningiomas. thirteen percent of the tumors contained interstitial/terminal deletions and gains, present singly or in combinations. we defined at least two minimal overlapping regions outside the nf <dig> locus that are small enough  to allow analysis of a limited number of candidate genes. bialleinactivationo the nf <dig> gne was detected in 36% of meningiomas. among the monosomy  <dig> cases, no additional nf <dig> mutations could be identified in 35%  of tumors. furthermore, the majority of tumors  with interstitial/terminal deletions did not have any detectable nf <dig> mutations. methylation within the nf <dig> promoter region was only identified at a single cpg site in one tumor sample.


CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed previous findings of pronounced differences in mutation frequency between different histopathological subtypes. there is a higher frequency of biallelic nf <dig> inactivation in fibroblastic  compared to meningothelial  tumors. the presence of macro-mutations on 22q also shows marked differences between fibroblastic  and meningothelial  subtypes. thus, inactivation of nf <dig>  often combined with the presence of macro-mutation on 22q, is likely not as important for the development of the meningothelial subtype, as opposed to the fibroblastic form. analysis of  <dig> cpg sites distributed within  <dig> bp of the promoter region suggests that nf <dig> promoter methylation does not play a major role in meningioma development.
