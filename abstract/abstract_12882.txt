BACKGROUND
neuroblastoma amplified gene  was identified as a gene co-amplified with the n-myc gene, whose genomic amplification correlates with poor prognosis of neuroblastoma. later it was found that nag is localized in endoplasmic reticulum  and is a component of the syntaxin  <dig> complex that is involved in golgi-to-er retrograde transport in human cells. homologous sequences of nag are found in plant databases, but its function in plant cells remains unknown.


RESULTS
nicotiana benthamania neuroblastoma-amplified gene  encodes a protein of  <dig>  amino acids that contains the secretory pathway sec <dig> domain and is mainly localized in the er. silencing of nbnag by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in growth arrest and acute plant death with morphological markers of programmed cell death , which include chromatin fragmentation and modification of mitochondrial membrane potential. nbnag deficiency caused induction of er stress genes, disruption of the er network, and relocation of bzip <dig> transcription factor from the er membrane to the nucleus, similar to the phenotypes of tunicamycin-induced er stress in a plant cell. nbnag silencing caused defects in intracellular transport of diverse cargo proteins, suggesting that a blocked secretion pathway by nbnag deficiency causes er stress and programmed cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that nag, a conserved protein from yeast to mammals, plays an essential role in plant growth and development by modulating protein transport pathway, er stress response and pcd.
