BACKGROUND
metastasis is the primary cause of death for cancer patients. twist <dig>  an evolutionarily conserved basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor, is a strong promoter of metastatic spread and its expression is elevated in many advanced human carcinomas. however, the molecular events triggered by twist <dig> to motivate dissemination of cancer cells are largely unknown.


RESULTS
here we show that twist <dig> induces the production of interleukin  <dig> , which activates matrix metalloproteinases and promotes invasion of breast epithelial and cancer cells. in this novel mechanism, twist1-mediated il <dig> transcription is induced through the twist <dig> carboxy-terminal wr  domain instead of the classic dna binding bhlh domain. co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the wr domain mediates the formation of a protein complex comprised of twist <dig> and the nuclear factor-kappab  subunit rela , which synergistically activates the transcriptional activity of nf-κb. this activation leads to increased dna binding affinity of rela to the il <dig> promoter and thus induces the expression of the cytokine. blockage of il <dig> signaling by il <dig> neutralizing antibodies or receptor inhibition reduced the invasiveness of both breast epithelial and cancer cells, indicating that twist <dig> induces autonomous cell invasion by establishing an il <dig> antocrine loop.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that the twist <dig> wr domain plays a critical role in twist1-induced il <dig> expression through interactions with and activation of nf-κb. the produced il <dig> signals through an autocrine loop and promotes extracellular matrix degradation to enable cell invasion across the basement membrane.
