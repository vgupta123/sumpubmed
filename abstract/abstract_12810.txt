BACKGROUND
the major histocompatibility complex is the main genetic contributor to susceptibility to type  <dig> diabetes ; genome-wide scans have consistently mapped increased predisposition to this region. the highest disease risk has been associated with hla-dr <dig> and hla-dr <dig>  in particular, the dr3-positive ancestral haplotype  <dig>  was reported as highly diabetogenic. we aimed to corroborate whether this haplotype increases the susceptibility conferred by the dq2-dr <dig> alleles in a mediterranean population. we also searched for additional susceptibility factors to the classic dq2-dr <dig> and dq8-dr <dig> 


RESULTS
genetic mhc markers were analysed in a case-control study with  <dig> t1d patients and  <dig> ethnically matched controls. dr3-tnfa1b <dig> carrier rate was significantly higher in dr3-positive heterozygous t1d patients than in dr3-positive heterozygous controls . this data was confirmed analysing the allelic frequency, which includes the information corresponding to the dr3-homozygous individuals  and by using the arlequin software to check the dr3-positive haplotypes . the present results provide strong evidence of a second susceptibility region in the ancestral haplotype  <dig>  in the spanish population.

moreover, we searched for t1d susceptibility factors in addition to the mhc classical ones, within the dr2-dq6/dr3-dq2/dr4-dq <dig> negative population. several genetic markers in both mhc class ii  and iii  were found. these different alleles associated with t1d were not independent and we observed linkage disequilibrium among them leading us to describe two new risk haplotypes . finally, we studied a t1d susceptibility/protection marker located in extended class i, d6s2223; however, no association was observed in our population.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that other associated mhc haplotypes might present susceptibility factors in loci different from hla-class ii and that the class ii molecules are not necessarily the universal etiologic factor in every mhc haplotype.
