BACKGROUND
pinus pinaster ait. is a major resin producing species in spain. genetic linkage mapping can facilitate marker-assisted selection  through the identification of quantitative trait loci and selection of allelic variants of interest in breeding populations. in this study, we report annotated genetic linkage maps for two individuals  belonging to a breeding program aiming to increase resin production. we use different types of dna markers, including last-generation molecular markers.


RESULTS
we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> linkage groups for c <dig> and c <dig> maps, respectively. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> markers were positioned on each map and estimated genome length was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively, which represents near 65% of genome coverage. comparative mapping with previously developed genetic linkage maps for p. pinaster based on about  <dig> common markers enabled aligning linkage groups to this reference map. the comparison of our annotated linkage maps and linkage maps reporting qtl information revealed  <dig> annotated snps in candidate genes that co-localized with previously reported qtls for wood properties and water use efficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides genetic linkage maps from a spanish population that shows high levels of genetic divergence with french populations from which segregating progenies have been previously mapped. these genetic maps will be of interest to construct a reliable consensus linkage map for the species. the importance of developing functional genetic linkage maps is highlighted, especially when working with breeding populations for its future application in mas for traits of interest.
