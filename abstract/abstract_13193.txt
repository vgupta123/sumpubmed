BACKGROUND
dna methylation is a widely studied epigenetic phenomenon; alterations in methylation patterns influence human phenotypes and risk of disease. as part of the atherosclerosis risk in communities  study, the illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig>  beadchip was used to measure dna methylation in peripheral blood obtained from ~ <dig> african american study participants. over  <dig>  cytosine-guanine  dinucleotide sites were surveyed on the hm <dig> beadchip. to evaluate the impact of technical variation,  <dig> technical replicates from  <dig> participants were included in the study.


RESULTS
for each cpg site, we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient  to compare variation of methylation levels within- and between-replicate pairs, ranging between  <dig> and  <dig>  we modeled the distribution of icc as a mixture of censored or truncated normal and normal distributions using an em algorithm. the cpg sites were clustered into low- and high-reliability groups, according to the calculated posterior probabilities. we also demonstrated the performance of this clustering when applied to a study of association between methylation levels and smoking status of individuals. for the cpg sites showing genome-wide significant association with smoking status, most  were seen from sites in the high reliability cluster.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that cpg sites with low icc may be excluded from subsequent association analyses, or extra caution needs to be taken for associations at such sites.
