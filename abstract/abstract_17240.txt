BACKGROUND
for industrial bioconversion processes, the utilization of surface-displayed lipase in the form of whole-cell biocatalysts is more advantageous, because the enzymes are displayed on the cell surface spontaneously, regarded as immobilized enzymes.


RESULTS
two pichia pastoris cell surface display vectors based on the flocculation functional domain of flo with its own secretion signal sequence or the α-factor secretion signal sequence were constructed respectively. the lipase gene lipb <dig> fused with the flo gene was successfully transformed into pichia pastoris km <dig>  the lipase lipb <dig> was expressed under the control of the aox <dig> promoter and displayed on pichia pastoris km <dig> cell surface with the two pichia pastoris cell surface display vectors. localization of the displayed lipb <dig> on the cell surface was confirmed by the confocal laser scanning microscopy . the lipb <dig> displayed on the pichia pastoris cell surface exhibited activity toward p-nitrophenol ester with carbon chain length ranging from c <dig> to c <dig>  and the optimum substrate was p-nitrophenol-caprate , which was consistent with it displayed on the saccharomyces cerevisiae eby <dig> cell surface. the hydrolysis activity of lipase lipb <dig> displayed on pichia pastoris km71-plhj <dig> and km71-plhj <dig> cell surface reached  <dig> and  <dig> u/g dry cell, respectively. the optimum temperature of the displayed lipases was 40°c at ph <dig> , they retained over 90% activity after incubation at 60°c for  <dig> hours at ph  <dig> , and still retained 85% activity after incubation for  <dig> hours.


CONCLUSIONS
the lipb <dig> displayed on the pichia pastoris cell surface exhibited better stability than the lipase lipb <dig> displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface. the displayed lipases exhibited similar transesterification activity. but the pichia pastoris dry cell weight per liter  ferment culture was about  <dig> times than saccharomyces cerevisiae, the lipase displayed on pichia pastoris are more suitable for whole-cell biocatalysts than that displayed on saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface.
