BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant source of genetic variation among individuals of a species. new genotyping technologies allow examining hundreds to thousands of snps in a single reaction for a wide range of applications such as genetic diversity analysis, linkage mapping, fine qtl mapping, association studies, marker-assisted or genome-wide selection. in this paper, we evaluated the potential of highly-multiplexed snp genotyping for genetic mapping in maritime pine , the main conifer used for commercial plantation in southwestern europe.


RESULTS
we designed a custom goldengate assay for  <dig>  snps detected through the resequencing of gene fragments  and from sanger-derived expressed sequenced tags assembled into a unigene set . offspring from three-generation outbred  and inbred  pedigrees were genotyped. the success rate of the assay was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for in silico and in vitro snps, respectively. a genotyping error rate of  <dig> % was further estimated from segregating data of snps belonging to the same gene. overall,  <dig> snps were available for mapping. a total of  <dig> snps were integrated with previously mapped markers in the g <dig> parental maps, while  <dig> snps were localized on the map generated from the analysis of the f <dig> progeny. based on  <dig> markers segregating in both pedigrees, we were able to generate a consensus map comprising  <dig> snps from  <dig> different loci. finally, the analysis of sequence homology between mapped markers and their orthologs in a pinus taeda linkage map, made it possible to align the  <dig> linkage groups of both species.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the goldengate assay can be used successfully for high-throughput snp genotyping in maritime pine, a conifer species that has a genome seven times the size of the human genome. this snp-array will be extended thanks to recent sequencing effort using new generation sequencing technologies and will include snps from comparative orthologous sequences that were identified in the present study, providing a wider collection of anchor points for comparative genomics among the conifers.
