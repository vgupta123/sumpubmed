BACKGROUND
accurate gene model predictions and annotation of alternative splicing events are imperative for genomic studies in organisms that contain genes with multiple exons. currently most gene models for the intracellular parasite, toxoplasma gondii, are based on computer model predictions without cdna sequence verification. additionally, the nature and extent of alternative splicing in toxoplasma gondii is unknown. in this study, we used de novo transcript assembly and the published type ii  genomic sequence to quantify the extent of alternative splicing in toxoplasma and to improve the current toxoplasma gene annotations.


RESULTS
we used high-throughput rna-sequencing data to assemble full-length transcripts, independently of a reference genome, followed by gene annotation based on the me <dig> genome. we assembled  <dig>  transcripts overlapping with known me <dig> genes in toxodb and then used this set to; a) improve the annotation in the untranslated regions of toxodb genes, b) identify novel exons within protein-coding toxodb genes, and c) report on  <dig> previously unidentified alternatively spliced transcripts. additionally, we assembled a set of  <dig>  transcripts not overlapping with any known me <dig> genes in toxodb. from this set, we have identified  <dig> new me <dig> genes,  <dig> novel toxoplasma genes, and putative non-coding rnas.


CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq data and de novo transcript assembly provide a robust way to update incompletely annotated genomes, like the toxoplasma genome. we have used rna-seq to improve the annotation of several toxoplasma genes, identify alternatively spliced genes, novel genes, novel exons, and putative non-coding rnas.
