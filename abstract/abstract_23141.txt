BACKGROUND
validation of single nucleotide variations in whole-genome sequencing is critical for studying disease-related variations in large populations. a combination of different types of next-generation sequencers for analyzing individual genomes may be an efficient means of validating multiple single nucleotide variations calls simultaneously.


RESULTS
here, we analyzed  <dig> independent japanese genomes using two next-generation sequencing platforms: the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform for whole-genome sequencing , and the ion proton semiconductor sequencer for whole exome sequencing . single nucleotide polymorphism  calls based on the illumina human omni  <dig> - <dig> snp chip data were used as the reference. we compared the variant calls for the  <dig> samples, and found that the concordance between the two next-generation sequencing platforms varied between 83% and 97%.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show the versatility and usefulness of the combination of exome sequencing with whole-genome sequencing in studies of human population genetics and demonstrate that combining data from multiple sequencing platforms is an efficient approach to validate and supplement snp calls.
