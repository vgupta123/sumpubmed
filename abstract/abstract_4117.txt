BACKGROUND
term amniotic membrane  is a very attractive source of mesenchymal stem cells  due to the fact that this fetal tissue is usually discarded without ethical conflicts, leading to high efficiency in msc recovery with no intrusive procedures. here we confirmed that term am, as previously reported in the literature, is an abundant source of hmscs; in particular we further investigated the am differentiation potential by assessing whether these cells may also be committed to the angiogenic fate. in agreement with the recommendation of the international society for cellular therapy, the mesenchymal cells herein investigated were named amniotic membrane-human mesenchymal stromal cells .


RESULTS
the recovery of hmscs and their in vitro expansion potential were greater in amniotic membrane than in bone marrow stroma. at flow cytometry analysis am-hmscs showed an immunophenotypical profile, i.e., positive for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and negative for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  consistent with that reported for bone marrow-derived mscs. in addition, amniotic membrane-isolated cells underwent in vitro osteogenic , adipogenic , chondrogenic  and myogenic  differentiation. in angiogenic experiments, a spontaneous differentiation into endothelial cells was detected by in vitro matrigel assay and this behaviour has been enhanced through vascular endothelial growth factor  induction. according to these findings, vegf receptor  <dig> and  <dig>  were basally expressed in am-hmscs and the expression of endothelial-specific markers like flt- <dig> kdr, icam- <dig> increased after exposure to vegf together with the occurrence of cd <dig> and von willebrand factor positive cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study suggests that am-hmscs may emerge as a remarkable tool for the cell therapy of multiple diseased tissues. am-hmscs may potentially assist both bone and cartilage repair, nevertheless, due to their angiogenic potential, they may also pave the way for novel approaches in the development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts which are useful when vascularization of ischemic tissues is required.
