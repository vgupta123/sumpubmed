BACKGROUND
allele-specific expression  assays can be used to identify cis, trans, and cis-by-trans regulatory variation. understanding the source of expression variation has important implications for disease susceptibility, phenotypic diversity, and adaptation. while ase is commonly measured via relative fluorescence at a snp, next generation sequencing provides an opportunity to measure ase in an accurate and high-throughput manner using read counts.


RESULTS
we introduce a solexa-based method to perform large numbers of ase assays using only a single lane of a solexa flowcell. in brief, transcripts of interest, which contain a known snp, are pcr enriched and barcoded to enable multiplexing. then high-throughput sequencing is used to estimate allele-specific expression using sequencing counts. to validate this method, we measured the allelic bias in a dilution series and found high correlations between measured and expected values . we applied this method to a set of  <dig> genes in a drosophila simulans parental mix, f <dig> and introgression and found that for these genes the majority of expression divergence can be explained by cis-regulatory variation.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a new method with the capacity to measure ase for large numbers of assays using as little as one lane of a solexa flowcell. this will be a valuable technique for molecular and population genetic studies, as well as for verification of genome-wide data sets.
