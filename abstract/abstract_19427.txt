BACKGROUND
enteroinvasive escherichia coli  may be the causative agent of part of those million cases of diarrhea illness reported worldwide every year and attributable to shigella. that is because both enteropathogens have many common characteristics that difficult their identification either by traditional microbiological methods or by molecular tools used in the clinical laboratory settings. while shigella has been extensively studied, eiec remains barely characterized at the molecular level. recent eiec important outbreaks, apparently generating more life-threatening cases, have prompted us to screen eiec for virulence traits usually related to extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli . that could explain the appearance of eiec strains presenting higher virulence potential.


RESULTS
eiec strains were distributed mainly in three phylogroups in a serogroup-dependent manner. serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> were exclusively classified in phylogroup a; o <dig> in group e; and o28ac and o <dig> in group b <dig>  only two serogroups showed diverse phylogenetic origin as follows: o <dig> was assigned to groups a, b <dig>  c, and b <dig> , and o <dig> in groups e , and a  . eleven of  <dig> virulence genes  searched were detected, and the majority of the  <dig> different vgs combinations found were serogroup-specific. uropathogenic e. coli  pai genetic markers were detected in all eiec strains. pais ij <dig> and iicft <dig> were the most frequent . pai iv <dig> was restricted to some serogroups from phylogroups a, b <dig> and e. pai icft <dig> was uniquely detected in phylogroups b <dig> and e. a total of  <dig>  strains presented multiple pai markers . pais ij <dig> and iicft <dig> were found together in 80% of strains.


CONCLUSIONS
eiec is a dec pathovar that presents vgs and pathogenicity island genetic markers typically associated with expec, especially upec. these features are distributed in a phylogenetic and serogroup-dependent manner suggesting the existence of stable eiec subclones. the presence of phylogroups b <dig> and e strains allied to the presence of upec virulence-associated genes may underscore the ongoing evolution of eiec towards a hypervirulent pathotype.
