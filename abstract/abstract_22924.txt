BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile strain 630Δerm is a spontaneous erythromycin sensitive derivative of the reference strain  <dig> obtained by serial passaging in antibiotic-free media. it is widely used as a defined and tractable c. difficile strain. though largely similar to the ancestral strain, it demonstrates phenotypic differences that might be the result of underlying genetic changes. here, we performed a de novo assembly based on single-molecule real-time sequencing and an analysis of major methylation patterns.


RESULTS
in addition to single nucleotide polymorphisms and various indels, we found that the mobile element ctn <dig> is present in the gene encoding the methyltransferase ruma rather than adhesin cd <dig> where it is located in the reference strain.


CONCLUSIONS
together, the genetic features identified in this study may help to explain at least part of the phenotypic differences. the annotated genome sequence of this lab strain, including the first analysis of major methylation patterns, will be a valuable resource for genetic research on c. difficile.
