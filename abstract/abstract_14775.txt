BACKGROUND
with the continued growth in the volume both of experimental g protein-coupled receptor  data and of the related peer-reviewed literature, the ability of gpcr researchers to keep up-to-date is becoming increasingly curtailed.


RESULTS
we present work that integrates the biological data and annotations in the gpcr information system  with next-generation methods for intelligently exploring, visualising and interacting with the scientific articles used to disseminate them. this solution automatically retrieves relevant information from gpcrdb and displays it both within and as an adjunct to an article.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach allows researchers to extract more knowledge more swiftly from literature. importantly, it allows reinterpretation of data in articles published before gpcr structure data became widely available, thereby rescuing these valuable data from long-dormant sources.
