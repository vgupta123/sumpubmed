BACKGROUND
while contemporary methods of microarray analysis are excellent tools for studying individual microarray datasets, they have a tendency to produce different results from different datasets of the same disease. we aim to solve this reproducibility problem by introducing a technique . snet provides both quantitative and descriptive analysis of microarray datasets by identifying specific connected portions of pathways that are significant. we term such portions within pathways as “subnetworks”.


RESULTS
we tested snet on independent datasets of several diseases, including childhood all, dmd and lung cancer. for each of these diseases, we obtained two independent microarray datasets produced by distinct labs on distinct platforms. in each case, our technique consistently produced almost the same list of significant nontrivial subnetworks from two independent sets of microarray data. the gene-level agreement of these significant subnetworks was between  <dig> % to  <dig> %. in contrast, when the same pairs of microarray datasets were analysed using gsea, t-test and sam, this percentage fell between  <dig> % to  <dig> % for gsea,  <dig> % tp  <dig> % for t-test, and  <dig> % to  <dig> % for sam. furthermore, the genes selected using these existing methods did not form subnetworks of substantial size. thus it is more probable that the subnetworks selected by our technique can provide the researcher with more descriptive information on the portions of the pathway actually affected by the disease.


CONCLUSIONS
these results clearly demonstrate that our technique generates significant subnetworks and genes that are more consistent and reproducible across datasets compared to the other popular methods available . the large size of subnetworks which we generate indicates that they are generally more biologically significant . in addition, we have chosen two sample subnetworks and validated them with references from biological literature. this shows that our algorithm is capable of generating descriptive biologically conclusions.
