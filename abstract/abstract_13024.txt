BACKGROUND
genetic admixture is a common caveat for genetic association analysis. therefore, it is important to characterize the genetic structure of the population under study to control for this kind of potential bias.


RESULTS
in this study we have sampled over  <dig> unrelated individuals from the population of spain, and have genotyped them with a genome-wide coverage. we have carried out linkage disequilibrium, haplotype, population structure and copy-number variation  analyses, and have compared these estimates of the spanish population with existing data from similar efforts.


CONCLUSIONS
in general, the spanish population is similar to the western and northern europeans, but has a more diverse haplotypic structure. moreover, the spanish population is also largely homogeneous within itself, although patterns of micro-structure may be able to predict locations of origin from distant regions. finally, we also present the first characterization of a cnv map of the spanish population. these results and original data are made available to the scientific community.
