BACKGROUND
tropane alkaloids  including anisodamine, anisodine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine are a group of important anticholinergic drugs with rapidly increasing market demand, so it is significant to improve ta production by biotechnological approaches. putrescine n-methyltransferase  was considered as the first rate-limiting upstream enzyme while tropinone reductase i  was an important branch-controlling enzyme involved in ta biosynthesis. however, there is no report on simultaneous introduction of pmt and tri genes into any ta-producing plant including anisodus acutangulus , which is a solanaceous perennial plant that is endemic to china and is an attractive resource plant for production of ta.


RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> aapmt and aatri double gene transformed lines ,  <dig> aapmt single gene transformed lines  and  <dig> aatri single gene transformed lines  were generated. rt-pcr and real-time fluorescence quantitative analysis results revealed that total aapmt  and total aatri  gene transcripts in transgenic pt, p and t lines showed higher expression levels than native aapmt  and aatri  gene transcripts. as compared to the control and single gene transformed lines , pt transgenic hairy root lines produced significantly higher levels of ta. the highest yield of ta was detected as  <dig>  mg/g dw in line pt <dig>  which was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> -times higher than those of the control , p <dig>  and t <dig> , respectively. all the tested samples were found to possess strong radical scavenging capacity, which were similar to control.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the co-expression of aapmt and aatri genes in a. acutangulus hairy roots significantly improved the yields of ta and showed higher antioxidant activity than control because of higher total ta content, which is the first report on simultaneous introduction of pmt and tri genes into ta-producing plant by biotechnological approaches.
