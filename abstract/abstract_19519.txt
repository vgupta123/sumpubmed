BACKGROUND
the ncounter analysis system  is a technology that enables the digital quantification of multiplexed target rna molecules using color-coded molecular barcodes and single-molecule imaging. this system gives discrete counts of rna transcripts and is capable of providing a high level of precision and sensitivity at less than one transcript copy per cell.


RESULTS
we have designed a web application compatible with any modern web browser that accepts the raw count data produced by the nanostring ncounter analysis system, normalizes it according to guidelines provided by nanostring technologies, performs differential expression analysis on the normalized data, and provides a heatmap of the results from the differential expression analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
nanostride allows biologists to take raw data produced by a nanostring ncounter analysis system and easily interpret differential expression analysis of this data represented through a heatmap. nanostride is freely accessible to use on the nanostride website and is available to use under the gpl v <dig> license.
