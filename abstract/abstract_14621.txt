BACKGROUND
ataxia telangiectasia mutated  is a detector of double-strand breaks  and a crucial component of the dna damage response  along with p <dig> and nf- κb transcription factors and wip <dig> phosphatase. despite the recent advances in studying the ddr, the mechanisms of cell fate determination after dna damage induction is still poorly understood.


RESULTS
to investigate the importance of various ddr elements with particular emphasis on wip <dig>  we developed a novel mathematical model of atm/p53/nf- κb pathways. our results from in silico and in vitro experiments performed on u2-os cells with wip <dig> silenced to  <dig> %  revealed a strong dependence of cellular response to dna damages on this phosphatase. notably, wip1-rnai cells exhibited lower resistance to ionizing radiation  resulting in smaller clonogenicity and higher apoptotic fraction.


CONCLUSIONS
in this article, we demonstrated that wip <dig> plays a role as a gatekeeper of apoptosis and influences the pro-survival behaviour of cells – the level of wip <dig> increases to block the apoptotic decision when dna repair is successful. moreover, we were able to verify the dynamics of proteins and transcripts, apoptotic fractions and cells viability obtained from stochastic simulations using in vitro approaches. taken together, we demonstrated that the model can be successfully used in prediction of cellular behaviour after exposure to ir. thus, our studies may provide further insights into key elements involved in the underlying mechanisms of the ddr.
