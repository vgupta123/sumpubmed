BACKGROUND
an accurate test for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is urgently needed in immunosuppressed populations. the aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic power of enzyme-linked immunospot -based ifn-γ release assay in detecting active and latent tuberculosis in hiv-infected population in bacillus calmette-guerin -vaccinated area. a total of  <dig> hiv-infected individuals including  <dig> active tuberculosis patients were recruited. an elispot-based ifn-γ release assay, t-spot.tb, was used to evaluate the m. tuberculosis esat- <dig> and cfp- <dig> specific ifn-γ response. tuberculin skin test  was performed for all recruited subjects.


RESULTS
the subjects were divided into group hiv+atb , group hiv+ltb  and group hiv only . in group hiv+atb and hiv+ltb, t-spot.tb positive rate in subjects with tst < <dig> mm were 50%  and  <dig> % , respectively. individuals in group hiv+atb and hiv+ltb with cd4+ t cells <500/μl, t-spot.tb showed a higher sensitivity than tst . in addition, the sensitivity of t-spot.tb assay in group hiv+atb increased to >85% in patients with tb treatment for less than  <dig> month and cd4+ t cells ≥200/μl, while for patients treated for more than  <dig> months and cd4+ t cells <200/μl, the sensitivity was decreased to only  <dig> %. furthermore, the results could be generated by t-spot.tb assay within  <dig> hours, which was more rapid than tst with 48– <dig> hours.


CONCLUSIONS
elispot-based ifn-γ release assay is more sensitive and rapid for the diagnosis of tb infection in chinese hiv-infected individuals with history of bcg vaccination, and could be an effective tool for guiding preventive treatment with isoniazid in latently infected people and for tb control in china.
