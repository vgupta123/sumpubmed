BACKGROUND
dss <dig>  is a recently identified subunit of the 26s proteasome regulatory particle. in addition to its function in the protein degradation machinery, it has been linked to brca <dig>  and homologous dna recombination, mrna export, and exocytosis. while the fungal orthologues of dss <dig> are not essential for viability, the significance of dss <dig> in metazoans has remained unknown due to a lack of knockout animal models.


RESULTS
in the current study deletion of dss- <dig> was studied in caenorhabditis elegans with a dss- <dig> loss-of-function mutant and dss- <dig> directed rnai. the analysis revealed an essential role for dss- <dig> in oogenesis. in addition, dss- <dig> rnai caused embryonic lethality and larval arrest, presumably due to loss of the dss- <dig> mrna maternal contribution. dss-1::gfp fusion protein localised primarily in the nucleus. no apparent effect on proteasome function was found in dss- <dig> rnai treated worms. however, expression of the c. elegans dss- <dig> in yeast cells deleted for its orthologue sem <dig> rescued their temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, and partially rescued the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in these cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the first knockout animal model for the gene encoding the proteasome subunit dss-1/rpn15/sem <dig> is characterised in this study. in contrast to unicellular eukaryotes, the c. elegans dss- <dig> encodes an essential protein, which is required for embryogenesis, larval growth, and oogenesis, and which is functionally conserved with its yeast and human homologues.
