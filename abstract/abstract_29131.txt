BACKGROUND
herbaspirillum seropedicae smr <dig> is a nitrogen fixing endophyte associated with important agricultural crops. it produces polyhydroxybutyrate  which is stored intracellularly as granules. however, phb metabolism and regulatory control is not yet well studied in this organism.


RESULTS
in this work we describe the characterization of the phbf protein from h. seropedicae smr <dig> which was purified and characterized after expression in e. coli. the purified phbf protein was able to bind to eleven putative promoters of genes involved in phb metabolism in h. seropedicae smr <dig>  in silico analyses indicated a probable dna-binding sequence which was shown to be protected in dna footprinting assays using purified phbf. analyses using lacz fusions showed that phbf can act as a repressor protein controlling the expression of phb metabolism-related genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf regulates expression of phb-related genes by acting as a transcriptional repressor. the knowledge of the phb metabolism of this plant-associated bacterium may contribute to the understanding of the plant-colonizing process and the organism's resistance and survival in planta.
