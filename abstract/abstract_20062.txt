BACKGROUND
the reproducibility of transcriptomic biomarkers across datasets remains poor, limiting clinical application. we and others have suggested that this is in-part caused by differential error-structure between datasets, and their incomplete removal by pre-processing algorithms.

methods
to test this hypothesis, we systematically assessed the effects of pre-processing on biomarker classification using  <dig> different pre-processing methods and  <dig> distinct signatures of tumour hypoxia in  <dig> datasets .


RESULTS
we confirm strong pre-processing effects for all datasets and signatures, and find that these differ between microarray versions. importantly, exploiting different pre-processing techniques in an ensemble technique improved classification for a majority of signatures.


CONCLUSIONS
assessing biomarkers using an ensemble of pre-processing techniques shows clear value across multiple diseases, datasets and biomarkers. importantly, ensemble classification improves biomarkers with initially good results but does not result in spuriously improved performance for poor biomarkers. while further research is required, this approach has the potential to become a standard for transcriptomic biomarkers.
