BACKGROUND
event-related brain potentials  are usually assessed with univariate statistical tests although they are essentially multivariate objects. brain–computer interface applications are a notable exception to this practice, because they are based on multivariate classification of single-trial erps. multivariate erp assessment can be facilitated by feature extraction methods. one such method is t-cwt, a mathematical-statistical algorithm based on the continuous wavelet transform  and student’s t-test.


RESULTS
this article begins with a geometric primer on some basic concepts of multivariate statistics as applied to erp assessment in general and to the t-cwt method in particular. further, it presents for the first time a detailed, step-by-step, formal mathematical description of the t-cwt algorithm. a new multivariate outlier rejection procedure based on principal component analysis in the frequency domain is presented as an important pre-processing step. the matlab and gnu octave implementation of t-cwt is also made publicly available for the first time as free and open source code. the method is demonstrated on some example erp data obtained in a passive oddball paradigm. finally, some conceptually novel applications of the multivariate approach in general and of the t-cwt method in particular are suggested and discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
hopefully, the publication of both the t-cwt source code and its underlying mathematical algorithm along with a didactic geometric introduction to some basic concepts of multivariate statistics would make t-cwt more accessible to both users and developers in the field of neuroscience research.
