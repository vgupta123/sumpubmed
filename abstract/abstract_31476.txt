BACKGROUND
oct <dig> is a key factor of an expanded transcriptional network  that governs pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells  and in the inner cell mass from which escs are derived. a pending question is whether the establishment of the oct4-tn initiates during oogenesis or after fertilisation. to this regard, recent evidence has shown that oct <dig> controls a poorly known oct4-tn central to the acquisition of the mouse egg developmental competence. the aim of this study was to investigate the identity and extension of this maternal oct4-tn, as much as whether its presence is circumscribed to the egg or maintained beyond fertilisation.


RESULTS
by comparing the genome-wide transcriptional profile of developmentally competent eggs that express the oct <dig> protein to that of developmentally incompetent eggs in which oct <dig> is down-regulated, we unveiled a maternal oct4-tn of  <dig> genes. eighty of these transcripts escape post-fertilisation degradation and represent the maternal oct4-tn inheritance that is passed on to the 2-cell embryo. most of these  <dig> genes are expressed in cancer cells and  <dig> are notable companions of the oct <dig> transcriptome in escs.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide, for the first time, a developmental link between eggs, early preimplantation embryos and escs, indicating that the molecular signature that characterises the escs identity is rooted in oogenesis. also, they contribute a useful resource to further study the mechanisms of oct <dig> function and regulation during the maternal-to-embryo transition and to explore the link between the regulation of pluripotency and the acquisition of de-differentiation in cancer cells.
