BACKGROUND
sexual dimorphism in brain size is common among primates, including humans, apes and some old world monkeys. in these species, the brain size of males is generally larger than that of females. curiously, this dimorphism has persisted over the course of primate evolution and human origin, but there is no explanation for the underlying genetic controls that have maintained this disparity in brain size.


RESULTS
in the present study, we tested the effect of the female hormone  on seven genes known to be related to brain size in both humans and nonhuman primates, and we identified half estrogen responsive elements  in the promoter regions of four genes . likewise, at sequence level, it appears that these half eres are generally conserved across primates. later testing via a reporter gene assay and cell-based endogenous expression measurement revealed that estradiol could significantly suppress the expression of the four affected genes involved in brain size. more intriguingly, when the half eres were deleted from the promoters, the suppression effect disappeared, suggesting that the half eres mediate the regulation of estradiol on the brain size genes. we next replicated these experiments using promoter sequences from chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, and observed a similar suppressive effect of estradiol on gene expression, suggesting that this mechanism is conserved among primate species that exhibit brain size dimorphism.


CONCLUSIONS
brain size dimorphism among certain primates, including humans, is likely regulated by estrogen through its sex-dependent suppression of brain size genes during development.
