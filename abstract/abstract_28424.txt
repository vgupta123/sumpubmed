BACKGROUND
geothermal areas are of great interest for the study of microbial communities. the results of such investigations can be used in a variety of fields  to answer fundamental questions, as well as those with practical benefits. uzon caldera is located in the uzon-geyser depression that is situated in the centre of the karym-semyachin region of the east kamchatka graben-synclinorium. the microbial communities of zavarzin spring are well studied; however, its benthic microbial mat has not been previously described.


RESULTS
pyrosequencing of the v <dig> region of the 16s rrna gene was used to study the benthic microbial community of the zavarzin thermal spring . the community is dominated by bacteria , including thermophilic, chemoorganotrophic caldiserica  and dictyoglomi . the benthic community and the previously examined planktonic community of zavarzin spring have qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different, compositions.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed a metagenomic analysis of the benthic microbial mat of zavarzin spring. we compared this benthic community to microbial communities found in the water and of an integral probe consisting of water and bottom sediments. various phylogenetic groups of microorganisms, including potentially new ones, represent the full-fledged trophic system of zavarzin. a thorough geochemical study of the spring was performed.
