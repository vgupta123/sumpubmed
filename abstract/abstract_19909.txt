BACKGROUND
the ability to visualize genomic features and design experimental assays that can target specific regions of a genome is essential for modern biology. to assist in these tasks, we present genomorama, a software program for interactively displaying multiple genomes and identifying potential dna hybridization sites for assay design.


RESULTS
useful features of genomorama include genome search by dna hybridization , efficient multi-scale display and manipulation of multiple genomes, support for many genome file types and the ability to search for and retrieve data from the national center for biotechnology information  entrez server.


CONCLUSIONS
genomorama provides an efficient computational platform for visualizing and analyzing multiple genomes.
