BACKGROUND
the identity of herpesviruses isolated in europe from domestic pigeons  as well as falcons and owls remains unknown. all these herpesviruses are antigenically and genetically related. the falcons and owls are thought to have become infected during the ingestion of pigeon meat thus suggesting the virusâ€™s capacity to infect a wide range of hosts. the aim of the conducted study was to detect the occurrence of cohv- <dig> and estimating the similarities and differences in the dna-dependent dna polymerase gene of herpesviruses isolated from domestic pigeons, birds of prey and non-raptorial free-ranging birds in poland.


RESULTS
the study has shown the presence of cohv- <dig> in  <dig> %  in the examined birds. in case of one cohv- <dig>  infected peregrine falcon , neurological signs were observed. nucleotide sequencing of the dna-dependent dna polymerase gene, showed a high similarity among polish strains , independently from the species of the affected birds. only one compared cohv- <dig> strain - kp 21/ <dig> originating from germany showed a slightly lower similarity at a level of  <dig> %. further analysis has shown the identity of dna-dependent dna polymerase of cohv- <dig> strains and other herpesviruses present in poultry as well as other birds ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. interestingly cohv- <dig> infection was also confirmed for the first time in four non-raptorial birds.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study has shown a high similarity of cohv- <dig> strains and the possible transmission of herpesviruses between domestic rock pigeons and free-ranging birds including raptors and non-raptorial birds. further studies focused on cloning and the analysis of the whole cohv- <dig> genome which is needed to explain the role of the observed similarities and differences between field strains of columbid herpesviruses.
