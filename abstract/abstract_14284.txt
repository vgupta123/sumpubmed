BACKGROUND
metamorphosis is a complex, highly conserved and strictly regulated development process that involves the programmed cell death of obsolete larval organs. here we show a novel functional role for the aspartic proteinase cathepsin d during insect metamorphosis.


RESULTS
cathepsin d of the silkworm bombyx mori  was ecdysone-induced, differentially and spatially expressed in the larval fat body of the final instar and in the larval gut of pupal stage, and its expression led to programmed cell death. furthermore, bmcatd was highly induced in the fat body of baculovirus-infected b. mori larvae, suggesting that this gene is involved in the induction of metamorphosis of host insects infected with baculovirus. rna interference -mediated bmcatd knock-down inhibited programmed cell death of the larval fat body, resulting in the arrest of larval-pupal transformation. bmcatd rnai also inhibited the programmed cell death of larval gut during pupal stage.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these results, we concluded that bmcatd is critically involved in the programmed cell death of the larval fat body and larval gut in silkworm metamorphosis.
