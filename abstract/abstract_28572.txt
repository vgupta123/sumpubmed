BACKGROUND
in the violaxanthin  cycle, v is de-epoxidized to zeaxanthin  when strong light or light combined with other stressors lead to an overexcitation of photosystems. however, plants can also suffer stress in darkness and recent reports have shown that dehydration triggers v-de-epoxidation in the absence of light. in this study, we used the highly stress-tolerant brown alga pelvetia canaliculata as a model organism, due to its lack of lutein and its non-photochemical quenching independent of the transthylakoidal-Î”ph, to study the triggering of the v-cycle in darkness induced by abiotic stressors.


RESULTS
we have shown that besides desiccation, other factors such as immersion, anoxia and high temperature also induced v-de-epoxidation in darkness. this process was reversible once the treatments had ceased . irrespective of the stressor applied, the resulting de-epoxidised xanthophylls correlated with a decrease in fv/fm, suggesting a common function in the down-regulation of photosynthetical efficiency. the implication of the redox-state of the plastoquinone-pool and of the differential activity of v-cycle enzymes on v-de-epoxidation in darkness was also examined. current results suggest that both violaxanthin de-epoxidase  and zeaxanthin-epoxidase  have a basal constitutive activity even in darkness, being ze inhibited under stress. this inhibition leads to z accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that v-cycle activity is triggered by several abiotic stressors even when they occur in an absolute absence of light, leading to a decrease in fv/fm. this finding provides new insights into an understanding of the regulation mechanism of the v-cycle and of its ecophysiological roles.
