BACKGROUND
molecular typing of mycobacterium tuberculosis strains has become a valuable tool in the epidemiology of tuberculosis  by allowing detection of outbreaks, tracking of epidemics, identification of genotypes and transmission events among patients who would have remained undetected by conventional contact investigation. this is the first genetic biodiversity study of m. tuberculosis in venezuela. thus, we investigated the genetic patterns of strains isolated in the first survey of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance realised as part of the global project of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance .


RESULTS
clinical isolates  were genotyped by spoligotyping. the results were compared with the international spoligotyping database . multidrug resistant  strains  were also analysed by is6110-rflp assays, and resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin was characterised.

spoligotyping grouped 82%  of the strains into  <dig> clusters. twenty new spoligotypes  specific to venezuela were identified. eight new inter-regional clusters were created. the beijing genotype was not found. the genetic network shows that the latin american and mediterranean family constitutes the backbone of the genetic tb population-structure in venezuela, responsible of >60% of total tb cases studied. mdr was  <dig> % in never treated patients and  <dig> % in previously treated patients. mutations in rpob gene and katg genes were detected in 64% and 43% of the mdr strains, respectively.

two clusters were found to be identical by the four different analysis methods, presumably representing cases of recent transmission of mdr tuberculosis.


CONCLUSIONS
this study gives a first overview of the m. tuberculosis strains circulating in venezuela during the first survey of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance. it may aid in the creation of a national database that will be a valuable support for further studies.
