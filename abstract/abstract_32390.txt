BACKGROUND
the condensation of chromosomes and correct sister chromatid segregation during cell division is an essential feature of all proliferative cells. structural maintenance of chromosomes  and non-smc proteins form the condensin i complex and regulate chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. however, due to the lack of appropriate mutants, the function of the condensin i complex during vertebrate development has not been described.


RESULTS
here, we report the positional cloning and detailed characterization of retinal phenotypes of a zebrafish mutation at the cap-g locus. high resolution live imaging reveals that the progression of mitosis between prometa- to telophase is delayed and that sister chromatid segregation is impaired upon loss of cap-g. cap-g associates with chromosomes between prometa- and telophase of the cell cycle. loss of the interaction partners cap-h and cap-d <dig> causes cytoplasmic mislocalization of cap-g throughout mitosis. dna content analysis reveals increased genomic imbalances upon loss of non-smc condensin i subunits. within the retina, loss of condensin i function causes increased rates of apoptosis among cells within the proliferative ciliary marginal zone  whereas postmitotic retinal cells are viable. inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis partially rescues cell numbers in cap-g mutant retinae and allows normal layering of retinal cell types without alleviating their aberrant nuclear sizes.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that the condensin i complex is particularly important within rapidly amplifying progenitor cell populations to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. in contrast, differentiation of postmitotic retinal cells is not impaired upon polyploidization.
