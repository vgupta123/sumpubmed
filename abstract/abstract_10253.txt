BACKGROUND
pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea pg <dig> causes bacterial blight on soybean plants and enters the leaf tissue through stomata or open wounds, where it encounters a sucrose-rich milieu. sucrose is utilized by invading bacteria via the secreted enzyme, levansucrase , liberating glucose and forming the polyfructan levan. p. syringae pg <dig> possesses two functional lsc alleles transcribed at virulence-promoting low temperatures.


RESULTS
we hypothesized that transcription of lsc is controlled by the hexose metabolism repressor, hexr, since potential hexr binding sites were identified upstream of both lsc genes. a hexr mutant of pg <dig> was significantly growth-impaired when incubated with sucrose or glucose as sole carbon source, but exhibited wild type growth when arabinose was provided. analyses of lsc expression resulted in higher transcript and protein levels in the hexr mutant as compared to the wild type. the hexr mutant’s ability to multiply in planta was reduced. hexr did not seem to impact hrp gene expression as evidenced by the hexr mutant’s unaltered hypersensitive response in tobacco and its unmodified protein secretion pattern as compared to the wild type under hrp-inducing conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggested a co-regulation of genes involved in extra-cellular sugar acquisition with those involved in intra-cellular energy-providing metabolic pathways in p. syringae.
