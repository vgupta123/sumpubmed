BACKGROUND
diva /bclb is a bcl- <dig> family member, which is known for its function in apoptosis. diva/bclb has been shown to interact with ndpkb/nm23h <dig>  which is involved in cellular differentiation. thus far, there has been no direct evidence of diva/bclb having a role in differentiation. in the present study, we investigated the expression of diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> during differentiation in pc- <dig> cell line.


RESULTS
our results show that after differentiation, diva/bclb expression was decreased and reciprocally, ndpkb/nm23h <dig> expression was increased and it translocated into the nucleus. overexpression of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> promoted pc- <dig> neuronal differentiation by increasing neurite outgrowth and arresting cell cycle progression. there was a concurrent downregulation of diva/boo when ndpkb/nm23h <dig> was overexpressed, which mirrors the effect of ngf on pc- <dig> cell differentiation. overexpression of diva/bclb did not change the expression level of ndpkb/nm23h <dig>  but inhibited its nuclear localization. cells that overexpressed diva/bclb presented a decreased percentage of differentiated cells and average neurite length was shortened. this was due to an increase in the formation of diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> complexes as well as diva/bclb and β-tubulin complexes. concomitantly, there was a decrease in formation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin complexes. overexpression of diva/bclb also resulted in a higher percentage of s-phase cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed a novel role for diva/bclb in neuronal differentiation. its downregulation during neuronal differentiation may be necessary to allow ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin interaction that promotes ndpkb/nm23h <dig> mediated differentiation.
