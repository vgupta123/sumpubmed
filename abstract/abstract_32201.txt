BACKGROUND
experimental analyses have identified strain-dependent factors that regulate susceptibility to anaphylaxis in mice. we assessed the susceptibility of the widely used 129svevbrd  mouse strain to ige/mast cell-mediated anaphylaxis as compared to balb/c. mice were subjected to passive and oral ovalbumin -induced active anaphylaxis. tissue mast cell, plasma histamine, total ige and ova-specific ige levels and susceptibility to histamine i.v infusion were assessed. bone marrow mast cell s were examined for fcεri, c-kit, degranulation efficiency, proliferation, apoptosis and cytokine profile.


RESULTS
129s <dig> mice had significantly increased susceptibility to passive and oral ova-induced active anaphylaxis. increased susceptibility to anaphylaxis was associated with increased homeostatic mast cell levels but not ova-specific ige or igg <dig> levels. in vitro analyses of bmmcs revealed no difference in fcεri and c-kit expression, however, 129s <dig> bmmcs possessed greater proliferative capacity and reduced caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. ige-bmmc degranulation assays demonstrated no difference in degranulation efficiency. furthermore, 129s <dig> mice possessed increased sensitivity to histamine-induced hypothermia.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that 129s <dig> mice have increased susceptibility to anaphylaxis as compared to balb/c strain and their increased susceptibility was associated with altered mast cell proliferation and homeostatic tissue levels and responsiveness to histamine. given the wide spread usage of the 129svevbrd strain of mice in experimental gene targeting methodology, these data have important implications for studying ige-reactions in mouse systems.
