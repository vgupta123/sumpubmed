BACKGROUND
human papillomavirus  tests are crucial diagnostic tools for the prevention of neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix. however most commercial methods are designed to detect high-risk  hpv types and a limited selection of low-risk ones, thus missing a fair number of intermediate/low-risk types. as a result, many hpv infections remain undiagnosed, generating distrust in virological diagnosis among gynaecologists, who continue to rely preferentially on cytological and colposcopic findings.


RESULTS
in this study, we tested  <dig>  consecutive clinical samples, most of them from italian patients with cytological abnormalities. the samples, collected in 2000– <dig>  were analyzed using pcr amplification of a 173– <dig> bp  conserved region in the l <dig> open reading frame, restriction endonuclease analysis and, where required, sequence analysis for type determination. analysis of a smaller male sample and long term follow-up of a few female subjects was also performed. a total of  <dig>  samples tested positive for hpv dna ;  <dig> % of them were mixed infections. overall,  <dig> known and  <dig> unknown hpv types were detected. their relative prevalence was calculated; notably, types not clearly identifiable using the most common commercial method accounted for 36% of infections. clinical findings associated with the underdiagnosed types ranged from h-sil to low-grade abnormalities, although none of these infections resulted in invasive cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
given the high prevalence of some underdiagnosed hpv types in the population  and their frequent association with cytological abnormalities, techniques capable of detecting and typing them would prove extremely useful.
