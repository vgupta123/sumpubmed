BACKGROUND
killer immunoglobulin-like receptors  are surface receptors of natural killer cells that bind to their corresponding human leukocyte antigen  class i ligands, making them interesting candidate genes for hla-associated autoimmune diseases, including type  <dig> diabetes . however, allelic and copy number variation in the kir region effectively mask it from standard genome-wide association studies: single nucleotide polymorphism  probes targeting the region are often discarded by standard genotype callers since they exhibit variable cluster numbers. quantitative polymerase chain reaction  assays address this issue. however, their cost is prohibitive at the sample sizes required for detecting effects typically observed in complex genetic diseases.


RESULTS
we propose a more powerful and cost-effective alternative, which combines signals from snps with more than three clusters found in existing datasets, with qpcr on a subset of samples. first, we showed that noise and batch effects in multiplexed qpcr assays are addressed through normalisation and simultaneous copy number calling of multiple genes. then, we used supervised classification to impute copy numbers of specific kir genes from snp signals. we applied this method to assess copy number variation in two kir genes, kir3dl <dig> and kir3ds <dig>  which are suitable candidates for t1d susceptibility since they encode the only kir molecules known to bind with hla-bw <dig> epitopes. we find no association between kir3dl1/3ds <dig> copy number and t1d in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls; a sample size twenty-fold larger than in any previous kir association study. due to our sample size, we can exclude odds ratios larger than  <dig>  for the common kir3dl1/3ds <dig> copy number groups at the 5% significance level.


CONCLUSIONS
we found no evidence of association of kir3dl1/3ds <dig> copy number with t1d, either overall or dependent on hla-bw <dig> epitope. five other kir genes, kir2ds <dig>  kir2dl <dig>  kir2dl <dig>  kir2ds <dig> and kir2ds <dig>  in high linkage disequilibrium with kir3dl <dig> and kir3ds <dig>  are also unlikely to be significantly associated. our approach could potentially be applied to other kir genes to allow cost effective assaying of gene copy number in large samples.
