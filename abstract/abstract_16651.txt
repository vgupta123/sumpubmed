BACKGROUND
flower color of soybean is primarily controlled by six genes, viz., w <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  wm and wp. this study was conducted to investigate the genetic and chemical basis of newly-identified flower color variants including two soybean mutant lines, 222-a- <dig>  and e30-d- <dig> , a near-isogenic line , flower color variants  descended from the w4-mutable line and kw <dig> .


RESULTS
complementation tests revealed that the flower color of 222-a- <dig> and kw <dig> was controlled by the recessive allele  of the w <dig> locus encoding dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  <dig> . in 222-a- <dig>  a single base was deleted in the first exon resulting in a truncated polypeptide consisting of  <dig> amino acids. in clark-w <dig>  base substitution of the first nucleotide of the fourth intron abolished the 5â€² splice site, resulting in the retention of the intron. the dfr <dig> gene of kw <dig> was not expressed. the above results suggest that complete loss-of-function of dfr <dig> gene leads to near white flowers. light purple flower of e30-d- <dig> was controlled by a new allele at the w <dig> locus, w4-lp. the gene symbol was approved by the soybean genetics committee. in e30-d- <dig>  a single-base substitution changed an amino acid at position  <dig> from arginine to histidine. pale flowers of t <dig> had higher expression levels of the dfr <dig> gene. these flower petals contained unique dihydroflavonols that have not yet been reported to occur in soybean and g. soja.


CONCLUSIONS
complete loss-of-function of dfr <dig> gene leads to near white flowers. a new allele of the w <dig> locus, w4-lp regulates light purple flowers. single amino acid substitution was associated with light purple flowers. flower petals of t <dig> had higher levels of dfr <dig> gene expression and contained unique dihydroflavonols that are absent in soybean and g. soja. thus, mutants of the dfr <dig> gene have unique flavonoid compositions and display a wide variety of flower color patterns in soybean, from near white, light purple, dilute purple to pale.
