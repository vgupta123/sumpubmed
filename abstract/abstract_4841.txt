BACKGROUND
high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical compound activity in tissue culture experiments requires time-consuming repeated analysis of the large amounts of data generated. automation of the evaluation procedure and assessment of measurement accuracy can save time and improve the comparability of results.


RESULTS
we present a tool for simultaneous evaluation of an arbitrary number of compound screens including a standardized statistical validation. it is provided as a novel r package with a tcl/tk-based gui for convenient use in the lab and runs on usual platforms like linux, windows and mac os. in a compound screen of lung cancer cells, the tool was successfully and efficiently applied for data analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the package provides an efficient and intuitive platform for automatic evaluation of compound screens, improving the performance and standardization of data analysis.
