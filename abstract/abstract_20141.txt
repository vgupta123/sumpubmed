BACKGROUND
connexin <dig>   is a gap junction protein with horizontal cell-restricted expression in zebrafish accumulating at dendritic sites within the receptor-horizontal cell complex in form of hemichannels where light-dependent plasticity occurs. this connexin is the first example of a gap junction protein processed to form two protein isoforms from a monocistronic message by an ires mediated process. the nuclear occurrence of a carboxy-terminal fragment of this protein provides evidence that this gap junction protein may participate in a putative cytoplasmic to nuclear signal transfer.


RESULTS
we characterized the ires element of cx <dig>  in terms of sequence elements necessary for its activity and protein factor, which may play a role for its function. two stretches of polypyrimidine tracts designated ppt <dig> and ppt <dig> which influence the ires activity of this neuronal gap junction protein were identified. selective deletion of ppt <dig> results in an appreciable decrease of the ires activity, while the deletion of ppt <dig> results in a complete loss. rna-emsa and uv-cross linking experiments showed that protein complexes bind to this ires element, of which the polypyrimidine tract binding protein  was identified as one of the interacting partners with influence on ires activity. these results indicate that ptb conveys a role in the regulation of the ires activity of cx <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that the activity of the ires element of the neuronal gap junction protein cx <dig>  is subject of regulation through flanking polypyrimidine tracts, and that the non-canonical trans-activation factor ptb plays an essential role in this process. this observation is of considerable importance and may provide initial insight into molecular-functional relationships of electrical coupling in horizontal cells.
