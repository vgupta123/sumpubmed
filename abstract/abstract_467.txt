BACKGROUND
soybean  seeds are the primary source of edible oil in the united states. despite its widespread utility, soybean oil is oxidatively unstable. until recently, the majority of soybean oil underwent chemical hydrogenation, a process which also generates trans fats. an alternative to chemical hydrogenation is genetic modification of seed oil through identification and introgression of mutant alleles. one target for improvement is the elevation of a saturated fat with no negative cardiovascular impacts, stearic acid, which typically constitutes a minute portion of seed oil .


RESULTS
we examined radiation induced soybean mutants with moderately increased stearic acid  via comparative whole genome hybridization and genetic analysis. the deletion of one sacpd isoform encoding gene  was perfectly correlated with moderate elevation of seed stearic acid content. however, sacpd-c deletion lines were also found to have altered nodule fatty acid composition and grossly altered morphology. despite these defects, overall nodule accumulation and nitrogen fixation were unaffected, at least under laboratory conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
although no yield penalty has been reported for moderate elevated seed stearic acid content in soybean seeds, our results demonstrate that genetic alteration of seed traits can have unforeseen pleiotropic consequences. we have identified a role for fatty acid biosynthesis, and sacpd activity in particular, in the establishment and maintenance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
