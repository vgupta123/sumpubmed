BACKGROUND
little information is available on the amelioration of boron  on aluminum -induced photosynthesis inhibition. sour pummelo  seedlings were irrigated for  <dig> weeks with nutrient solution containing  <dig> b levels  ×  <dig> al levels . the objectives of this study were to determine how b alleviates al-induced growth inhibition and to test the hypothesis that al-induced photosynthesis inhibition can be alleviated by b via preventing al from getting into shoots.


RESULTS
b had little effect on plant growth, root, stem and leaf al, leaf chlorophyll , co <dig> assimilation, ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase , chl a fluorescence  transient and related parameters without al stress except that root, stem and leaf b increased with increasing b supply and that  <dig> μm b decreased slightly root dry weight. al-treated roots, stems and leaves displayed a higher or similar b. b did not affect root al under al stress, but decreased stem and leaf al level. shoot growth is more sensitive to al stress than root growth, co <dig> assimilation, chl, rubisco, ojip transient and most related parameters. al-treated leaves showed decreased co <dig> assimilation, but increased or similar intercellular co <dig> concentration. both initial and total rubisco activity in al-treated leaves decreased to a lesser extent than co <dig> assimilation. al decreased maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry and total performance index, but increased minimum fluorescence, k-band, relative variable fluorescence at j- and i-steps. b could alleviate al-induced increase or decrease for all these parameters. generally speaking, the order of b effectiveness was  <dig> μm >  <dig> μm ≥  <dig> μm  >  <dig>  μm.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that al-induced photosynthesis inhibition was mainly caused by impaired photosynthetic electron transport chain, which may be associated with growth inhibition. b-induced amelioration of root inhibition was probably caused by b-induced changes in al speciation and/or sub-cellular compartmentation. however, b-induced amelioration of shoot and photosynthesis inhibition and photoinhibitory damage occurring at both donor and acceptor sides of photosystem ii could be due to less al accumulation in shoots.
