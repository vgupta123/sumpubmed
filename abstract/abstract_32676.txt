BACKGROUND
human intestinal epithelial cells  secrete the chemokine ccl <dig> in response to infection by various enteropathogenic bacteria or exposure to bacterial flagellin. ccl <dig> recruits immature dendritic cells and lymphocytes to target sites. here we investigated iec responses to various pathogenic and commensal bacteria as well as the modulatory effects of commensal bacteria on pathogen-induced ccl <dig> secretion. ht- <dig> human iecs were incubated with commensal bacteria , or with salmonella typhimurium, its flagellin, clostridium difficile, mycobacterium paratuberculosis, or mycobacterium smegmatis for varying times. in some studies, ht- <dig> cells were pre-treated with a commensal strain for  <dig> hr prior to infection or flagellin stimulation. ccl <dig> and interleukin - <dig> secretion and nuclear factor -κb activation were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.


RESULTS
compared to untreated cells, s. typhimurium, c. difficile, m. paratuberculosis, and flagellin activated nf-κb and stimulated significant secretion of ccl <dig> and il- <dig> by ht- <dig> cells. conversely, b. infantis, l. salivarius or m. smegmatis did not activate nf-κb or augment ccl <dig> or il- <dig> production. treatment with b. infantis, but not l. salivarius, dose-dependently inhibited the baseline secretion of ccl <dig>  in cells pre-treated with b. infantis, c. difficile-, s. typhimurium-, and flagellin-induced ccl <dig> were significantly attenuated. b. infantis did not limit m. paratuberculosis-induced ccl <dig> secretion.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to demonstrate that a commensal strain can attenuate ccl <dig> secretion in ht- <dig> iecs. collectively, the data indicate that m. paratuberculosis may mediate mucosal damage and that b. infantis can exert immunomodulatory effects on iecs that mediate host responses to flagellin and flagellated enteric pathogens.
