BACKGROUND
feed composition has a large impact on the growth of animals, particularly marine fish. we have developed a quantitative dynamic model that can predict the growth and body composition of marine fish for a given feed composition over a timespan of several months. the model takes into consideration the effects of environmental factors, particularly temperature, on growth, and it incorporates detailed kinetics describing the main metabolic processes  known to play major roles in growth and body composition.


RESULTS
for validation, we compared our model's predictions with the results of several experimental studies. we showed that the model gives reliable predictions of growth, nutrient utilization , and body composition over a timespan of several months, longer than most of the previously developed predictive models.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that, despite the difficulties involved, multiscale models in biology can yield reasonable and useful results. the model predictions are reliable over several timescales and in the presence of strong temperature fluctuations, which are crucial factors for modeling marine organism growth. the model provides important improvements over existing models.
