BACKGROUND
mouse chromosome  <dig> is linked to growth and body fat phenotypes in many mouse crosses. with the goal to identify the underlying genes regulating growth and body fat on mouse chromosome  <dig>  we developed five overlapping subcongenic strains that contained cast/eij donor regions in a c57bl/6jhg/hg background . to fine map qtl on distal mouse chromosome  <dig> a total of  <dig>  f <dig> mice from the five subcongenic strains, plus  <dig> f <dig> mice from the hg2d founder congenic strain were phenotyped and analyzed. interval mapping  and composite im  were performed on body weight and body fat traits on a combination of snp and microsatellite markers, which generated a high-density genotyping panel.


RESULTS
phenotypic analysis and interval mapping of total fat mass identified two qtl on distal mouse chromosome  <dig>  one qtl between  <dig> and  <dig> mb, fatq2a, and the second between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, fatq2b. the two qtl reside in different congenic strains with significant total fat differences between homozygous cast/cast and b6/b <dig> littermates. both of these qtl were previously identified only as a single qtl affecting body fat, fatq <dig>  furthermore, through a novel approach referred here as replicated cim, fatq2b was mapped to the gnas imprinted locus.


CONCLUSIONS
the integration of subcongenic strains, high-density genotyping, and cim succesfully partitioned two previously linked qtl  <dig> mb apart, and the strongest qtl, fatq2b, was fine mapped to a ~ <dig>  mb region interval encompassing the gnas imprinted locus.
