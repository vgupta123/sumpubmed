BACKGROUND
integrin α6β <dig> contributes to cancer progression by stimulating transcription as well as translation of cancer related genes. our previous study demonstrated that α6β <dig> stimulates translation initiation of survival factors such as vegf by activating mtor pathway. however, the immediate early signaling events that link α6β <dig> to mtor activation needs to be defined.


RESULTS
in the current studies, we demonstrated that c-src is an immediate early signaling molecule that acts upstream of α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation and subsequent translation of vegf in mda-mb-435/β <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cancer cells. m7gtp-sepharose–binding assay revealed that src activity is required to form eif4f complex which is necessary for cap-dependent translation in α6β <dig> expressing human cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our studies suggest that integrin β <dig> and c-src activation is important early signaling events to lead mtor activation and cap-dependent translation of vegf.
