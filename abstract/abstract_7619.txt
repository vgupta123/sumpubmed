BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing has provided comprehensive, affordable and high-throughput dna sequences for single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery in acacia auriculiformis and acacia mangium. like other non-model species, snp detection and genotyping in acacia are challenging due to lack of genome sequences. the main objective of this study is to develop the first high-throughput snp genotyping assay for linkage map construction of a. auriculiformis x a. mangium hybrids.


RESULTS
we identified a total of  <dig>  putative snps by aligning short read transcriptome data from four parents of two acacia hybrid mapping populations using bowtie against  <dig>  de novo transcriptome contigs. given a set of  <dig> validated snps from two lignin genes, our in silico snp detection approach is highly accurate  compared to the traditional in vitro approach . further validation of  <dig> snps using illumina goldengate assay gave an overall assay success rate of  <dig> % and conversion rate of  <dig> %. we explored possible factors lowering assay success rate by predicting exon-intron boundaries and paralogous genes of acacia contigs using medicago truncatula genome as reference. this assessment revealed that presence of exon-intron boundary is the main cause  of assay failure. subsequent snps filtering and improved assay design resulted in assay success and conversion rate of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively based on  <dig> snps genotyping. analysis of clustering patterns revealed that  <dig> % of the assays were not reproducible and flanking sequence might play a role in determining cluster compression. in addition, we identified a total of  <dig> and  <dig> polymorphic snps in a. auriculiformis and a. mangium natural germplasms, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully discovered a large number of snp markers in a. auriculiformis x a. mangium hybrids using next generation transcriptome sequencing. by using a reference genome from the most closely related species, we converted most snps to successful assays. we also demonstrated that illumina goldengate genotyping together with manual clustering can provide high quality genotypes for a non-model species like acacia. these snps markers are not only important for linkage map construction, but will be very useful for hybrid discrimination and genetic diversity assessment of natural germplasms in the future.
