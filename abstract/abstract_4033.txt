BACKGROUND
human leukocyte antigen  is a group of genes that are extremely polymorphic among individuals and populations and have been associated with more than  <dig> different diseases and adverse drug effects. hla typing is accordingly an important tool in clinical application, medical research, and population genetics. we have previously developed a phase-defined hla gene sequencing method using miseq sequencing.


RESULTS
here we report a simple, high-throughput, and cost-effective sequencing method that includes normalized library preparation and adjustment of dna molar concentration. we applied long-range pcr to amplify hla-b for  <dig> samples followed by transposase-based library construction and multiplex sequencing with the miseq sequencer. after sequencing, we observed low variation in read percentages  among the  <dig> demultiplexed samples. on this basis, all the samples were amenable to haplotype phasing using our phase-defined sequencing method. in our study, a sequencing depth of 800x was necessary and sufficient to achieve full phasing of hla-b alleles with reliable assignment of the allelic sequence to the  <dig> digit level.


CONCLUSIONS
our hla sequencing method optimized for  <dig> multiplexing samples is highly time effective and cost effective and is especially suitable for automated multi-sample library preparation and sequencing.
