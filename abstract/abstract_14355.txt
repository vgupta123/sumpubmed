BACKGROUND
the ubiquitous non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig>  plays a key role in ras/erk signaling downstream of most, if not all growth factors, cytokines and integrins, although its major substrates remain controversial. mutations in ptpn <dig> lead to several distinct human diseases. germ-line ptpn <dig> mutations cause about 50% of noonan syndrome , which is among the most common autosomal dominant disorders. leopard syndrome  is an acronym for its major syndromic manifestations: multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormalities of genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness. frequently, ls patients have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and they might also have an increased risk of neuroblastoma  and acute myeloid leukemia . consistent with the distinct pathogenesis of ns and ls, different types of ptpn <dig> mutations cause these disorders.


RESULTS
although multiple studies have reported the biochemical and biological consequences of ns- and ls-associated ptpn <dig> mutations, their structural consequences have not been analyzed fully. here we report the crystal structures of wt shp <dig> and five ns/ls-associated shp <dig> mutants. these findings enable direct structural comparisons of the local conformational changes caused by each mutation.


CONCLUSIONS
our structural analysis agrees with, and provides additional mechanistic insight into, the previously reported catalytic properties of these mutants. the results of our research provide new information regarding the structure-function relationship of this medically important target, and should serve as a solid foundation for structure-based drug discovery programs.
