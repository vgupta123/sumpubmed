BACKGROUND
a proportion of 1/ <dig> to 1/ <dig> of north african female pool is made of typical sub-saharan lineages, in higher frequencies as geographic proximity to sub-saharan africa increases. the sahara was a strong geographical barrier against gene flow, at least since  <dig>  years ago, when desertification affected a larger region, but the arab trans-saharan slave trade could have facilitate enormously this migration of lineages. till now, the genetic consequences of these forced trans-saharan movements of people have not been ascertained.


RESULTS
the distribution of the main l haplogroups in north africa clearly reflects the known trans-saharan slave routes: west is dominated by l1b, l2b, l2c, l2d, l3b and l3d; the center by l3e and some l3f and l3w; the east by l0a, l3h, l3i, l3x and, in common with the center, l3f and l3w; while, l2a is almost everywhere. ages for the haplogroups observed in both sides of the saharan desert testify the recent origin  of these haplogroups in sub-saharan africa, claiming a recent introduction in north africa, further strengthened by the no detection of local expansions.


CONCLUSIONS
the interpolation analyses and complete sequencing of present mtdna sub-saharan lineages observed in north africa support the genetic impact of recent trans-saharan migrations, namely the slave trade initiated by the arab conquest of north africa in the seventh century. sub-saharan people did not leave traces in the north african maternal gene pool for the time of its settlement, some  <dig>  years ago.
