BACKGROUND
granulysin, a cytotoxic protein expressed in human natural killer cells and activated t lymphocytes, exhibits cytolytic activity against a variety of intracellular microbes. expression and transcription have been partially characterised in vitro and four transcripts  were identified. however, only a single protein product of  <dig> kda was found, which is subsequently processed to an active  <dig> kda protein.


RESULTS
in this study we investigated generation of granulysin in lymphokine activated killer  cells and antigen  specific t-cells. semiquantitative rt-pcr revealed nkg <dig> to be the most prominent transcript. it was found to be up-regulated in a time-dependent manner in lak cells and antigen specific t-cells and their subsets. two isoforms of  <dig> mrna were up-regulated under il- <dig> and antigen stimulation. moreover, two novel transcripts, without any known function, comprising solely parts of the  <dig> prime region of the primary transcript, were detected. a significant increase of granulysin expressing lak cells as well as antigen specific t-cells was shown by fluorescence microscopy. on the subset level, increase in cd4+ granulysin expressing cells was found only under antigen stimulation.

immunoblotting showed the  <dig> kda form of granulysin to be present in the first week of stimulation either with il- <dig> or with bacterial antigen. substantial processing to the  <dig> kda form was detected during the first week in lak cells and in the second week in antigen specific t-cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this first comprehensive study of granulysin gene regulation in primary cultured human lymphocytes shows that the regulation of granulysin synthesis in response to il- <dig> or bacterial antigen stimulation occurs at several levels: rna expression, extensive alternative splicing and posttranslational processing.
