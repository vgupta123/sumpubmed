BACKGROUND
evolutionary analyses of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  have identified two distantly related clonal groups: ehec  <dig>  including serotype o157:h <dig> and its inferred ancestor o55:h7; and ehec  <dig>  comprised of several serogroups . these two clonal groups differ in their virulence and global distribution. although several fully annotated genomic sequences exist for strains of serotype o157:h <dig>  much less is known about the genomic composition of ehec  <dig>  in this study, we analyzed a set of  <dig> clinical ehec  <dig> strains representing serotypes o26:h <dig>  o111:h8/h <dig>  o118:h <dig>  o153:h <dig> and o15:h <dig> from humans and animals by comparative genomic hybridization  on an oligoarray based on the o157:h <dig> sakai genome.


RESULTS
backbone genes, defined as genes shared by sakai and k- <dig>  were highly conserved in ehec  <dig>  the proportion of sakai phage genes in ehec  <dig> was substantially greater than that of sakai-specific bacterial  genes. this proportion was inverted in o55:h <dig>  reiterating that a subset of sakai bacterial genes is specific to ehec  <dig>  split decomposition analysis of gene content revealed that o111:h <dig> was more genetically uniform and distinct from other ehec  <dig> strains, with respect to the sakai o157:h <dig> gene distribution. serotype o26:h <dig> was the most heterogeneous ehec  <dig> subpopulation, comprised of strains with the highest as well as the lowest levels of sakai gene content conservation. of the  <dig> parsimoniously informative genes, 15% were found to be compatible and their distribution in ehec  <dig> clustered o111:h <dig> and o118:h <dig> strains by serotype. cgh data suggested divergence of the lee island from the lee <dig> to the lee <dig> operon, and also between animal and human isolates irrespective of serotype. no correlation was found between gene contents and geographic locations of ehec  <dig> strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene content variation of phage-related genes in ehec  <dig> strains supports the hypothesis that extensive modular shuffling of mobile dna elements has occurred among ehec strains. these results suggest that ehec  <dig> is a multiform pathogenic clonal complex, characterized by substantial intra-serotype genetic variation. the heterogeneous distribution of mobile elements has impacted the diversification of o26:h <dig> more than other ehec  <dig> serotypes.
