BACKGROUND
circular forms of viral genomic dna are generated during infection of cells with retroviruses like hiv- <dig>  such circles are unable to replicate and are eventually lost as a result of cell division, lending support to the prevalent notion that episomal retroviral dna forms are dead-end products of reverse transcription.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that circular dna generated during transduction with hiv-1-based lentiviral vectors can be utilized as substrate for gene insertion directed by nonviral recombinases co-expressed in the target cells. by packaging of lentiviral genomic rna in integrase-defective lentiviral vectors, harboring an inactive form of the viral integrase, the normal pathway for viral integration is blocked and circular vector dna accumulates in transduced cells as a result. we find that the amount of dna circles is increased 4-fold in cells transduced with integration-defective vectors relative to cells treated with integrase-proficient vectors. by transduction of target cells harboring engineered recognition sites for the yeast flp recombinase with integration-defective lentiviral vectors containing an atg-deficient hygromycin b selection gene we demonstrate precise integration of lentiviral vector-derived dna circles in a drug-selective approach. moreover, it is demonstrated that trans-acting flp recombinase can be delivered by flp-encoding transfected plasmid dna or, alternatively, by co-transduced integrase-defective lentiviral vectors carrying a flp expression cassette.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide proof-of-principle that nonviral recombinases, like flp, produced by plasmid dna or non-integrating lentiviral vectors can gain access to circular viral recombination substrates and facilitate site-directed genomic insertion of such episomal dna forms. replacement of the normal viral integration machinery with nonviral mediators of integration represents a new platform for creation of lentiviral vectors with an altered integration profile.
