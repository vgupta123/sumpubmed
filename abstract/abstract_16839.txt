BACKGROUND
premedication is rarely used in avian species. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of premedication on the quality of sevoflurane induction and anaesthesia in parrots. we hypothesised that premedication would facilitate handling and decrease the minimum anaesthetic dose . thirty-six adult parrots were randomly distributed in three groups: group s  was premedicated with nacl  <dig> %; group ks  was premedicated with 10 mg.kg- <dig> ketamine; and group kds  was premedicated with 10 mg.kg- <dig> ketamine and  <dig>  mg.kg- <dig> diazepam, delivered intramuscularly. after induction using  <dig> % sevoflurane introduced through a facemask, the mad was determined for each animal. the heart rate , respiratory rate , systolic arterial blood pressure , and cloacal temperature  were recorded before premedication , 15 minutes after premedication , and after mad determination . arterial blood gas analyses were performed at t <dig> and t <dig>  the quality of anaesthesia was evaluated using subjective scales based on animal behaviour and handling during induction, maintenance, and recovery. statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance or kruskal-wallis tests followed by tukey’s or dunn’s tests.


RESULTS
the minimal anaesthetic doses obtained were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for groups s, ks, and kds, respectively. there were no differences in hr, rr, or ct among groups, but sap was significantly lower in group s. sedation was observed in both the premedicated s-ks and s-kds groups. there were no differences in the quality of intubation and recovery from anaesthesia among the three groups, although the induction time was significantly shorter in the pre-medicated groups, and the ks group showed less muscle relaxation.


CONCLUSIONS
ketamine alone or the ketamine/diazepam combination decreased the mad of sevoflurane in parrots . ketamine alone or in combination with diazepam promoted a good quality of sedation, which improved handling and reduced the stress of the birds. all protocols provided safe anaesthesia in this avian species.
