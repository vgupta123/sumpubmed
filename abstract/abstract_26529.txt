BACKGROUND
human b cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  are the only cells known to express both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the primary ifn-Î± producing cells in response to tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists. the direct effects of tlr <dig> stimulation on human b cells is less understood. the objective of this study was to compare the effects of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> stimulation on human b cell function.


RESULTS
gene expression and protein production of cytokines, chemokines, various b cell activation markers, and immunoglobulins were evaluated. purified human cd19+ b cells  from peripheral blood were stimulated with a tlr7-selective agonist , tlr7/ <dig> agonist , or tlr <dig> selective agonist cpg odn . tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists similarly modulated the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes , co-stimulatory molecules , fc receptors , anti-apoptotic genes , certain transcription factors , and genes critical for b cell proliferation and differentiation . both agonists also induced protein expression of the above cytokines and chemokines. additionally, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists induced the production of igm and igg. a tlr8-selective agonist was comparatively ineffective at stimulating purified human b cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that despite their molecular differences, the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists induce similar genes and proteins in purified human b cells.
