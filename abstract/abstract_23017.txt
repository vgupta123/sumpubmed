BACKGROUND
listeriosis, mostly caused by listeria monocytogenes species, has become a major concern to public health authorities due to its clinical severity and high mortality rate, particularly in high risk groups. currently, there is limited information regarding the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of listeria species in ready-to-eat foods of animal origin in gondar town, ethiopia. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of listeria species isolated from ready-to-eat food of animal origin from public dinning places in gondar town, ethiopia. a cross sectional study on ready-toeat foods of animal origin sampled from major supermarkets, butcher shops, pastry shops, restaurants and hotels was carried out. culture, biochemical and sugar tests were conducted for listeria species identification and disc diffusion test was performed to study the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the isolates.


RESULTS
out of  <dig> food samples examined,  <dig>  were positive for listeria species. listeria monocytogenes was detected in  <dig>  of the samples. listeria monocytogenes was isolated from cake, raw meat, ice cream, minced beef, fish, unpasteurized milk and pizza in that order from higher to lower rate. assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility profile of l. monocytogenes revealed the presence of four multi-drug resistant isolates. the higher resistance rate was recorded for penicillin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, in decreasing order. all l. monocytogenes identified in the current study were sensitive to amoxicillin, cephalothin, cloxacillin, sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin and vancomycin.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of l. monocytogenes including drug resistant and multidrug resistant isolates in some ready-to-eat food items is an indicator of the presence of public health hazards to the consumer, particularly to the high-risk groups. hence awareness creation on food safety and implementation of regulations about the use of drugs in humans and animals is strongly recommended.
