BACKGROUND
in mouse es cells, the function of sox <dig> is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency. since the sox-family of transcription factors are well conserved in the animal kingdom, addressing the evolutionary origin of sox <dig> function in pluripotent stem cells is intriguing from the perspective of understanding the origin of pluripotency.


RESULTS
here we approach this question using a functional complementation assay in inducible sox2-null es cells. assaying mouse sox proteins from different groups, we found that only group b <dig> and group g proteins were able to support pluripotency. interestingly, invertebrate homologs of mammalian group b <dig> sox proteins were able to replace the pluripotency-associated function of mouse sox <dig>  moreover, the mouse es cells rescued by the drosophila soxneuro protein are able to contribute to chimeric embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that the function of mouse sox <dig> supporting pluripotency is based on an evolutionally conserved activity of the group b <dig> sox family. since pluripotent stem cell population in developmental process could be regarded as the evolutional novelty in vertebrates, it could be regarded as a co-optional use of their evolutionally conserved function.
