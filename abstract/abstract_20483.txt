BACKGROUND
inadequate dietary selenium  intake in humans and animals can lead to long term health problems, such as cancer. in view of the owner’s desire for healthy longevity of companion animals, the impact of dietary se provision on long term health effects warrants investigation. little is currently known regards biomarkers, and rate of change of such biomarkers in relation to dietary selenium intake in dogs. in this study, selected biomarkers were assessed for their suitability to detect changes in dietary se in adult dogs within eight weeks.


RESULTS
twenty-four dogs were fed a semi-purified diet with an adequate amount of se  over an 8 week period. they were then divided into two groups. the first group remained on the adequate se diet, the second were offered a semi-purified diet with a low se concentration  for 8 weeks. weekly urine and blood was collected and hair growth measurements were performed. the urinary se to creatinine ratio and serum se concentration were significantly lower in dogs consuming the low se diet from week  <dig> onwards, by 84 %  and 7 %  respectively. serum and whole blood glutathione peroxidase were also significantly lower in dogs consuming the low se diet from weeks  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. none of the other biomarkers  responded significantly to the low se diet over the 8 week period.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that urinary se to creatinine ratio, serum se and serum and whole blood glutathione peroxidase can be used as biomarkers of selenium status in dogs. urinary se to creatinine ratio and serum se concentrations responded faster to decreased dietary se than the other parameters. this makes these biomarkers candidates for early screening of long term effects of dietary se provision on canine health.
