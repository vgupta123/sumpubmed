BACKGROUND
noroviruses  are members of the family caliciviridae and are emerging enteric pathogens of humans and animals. some porcine novs are genetically similar to human strains and are classified into gii, like most epidemic human novs. so far, ponov have been exclusively detected in fecal samples of adult pig without clinical signs.


RESULTS
result showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> evaluated fecal samples were positive for ponovs, one of which was positive for ponov alone, and the other was coinfected with porcine circovirus and ponov. phylogenetic and recombination analysis showed that the ponov positive alone strain was a recombinant new genotype strain. experimental infection of miniature pigs with fecal suspensions confirmed that this strain can cause gastroenteritis in piglets.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report that recombinant new genotype ponov exised in pig herd of china, which cause diarrhea in pigs in nature condition. this find raised questions about the putative epidemiologic role of ponov.
