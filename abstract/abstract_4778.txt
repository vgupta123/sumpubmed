BACKGROUND
in the genomic age, gene trees may contain large amounts of data making them hard to read and understand. therefore, an automated simplification is important.


RESULTS
we present a simplification tool for gene trees called treesimplifier. based on species tree information and hugo gene names, it summarizes "monophyla". these monophyla correspond to subtrees of the gene tree where the evolution of a gene follows species phylogeny, and they are simplified to single leaves in the gene tree. such a simplification may fail, for example, due to genes in the gene tree that are misplaced. in this way, misplaced genes can be identified. optionally, our tool glosses over a limited degree of "paraphyly" in a further simplification step. in both simplification steps, species can be summarized into groups and treated as equivalent. in the present study we used our tool to derive a simplified tree of  <dig> leaves from a tree of  <dig> leaves. comparing the simplified tree to a "cartoon tree" created manually, we note that both agree to a high degree.


CONCLUSIONS
our automatic simplification tool for gene trees is fast, accurate, and effective. it yields results of similar quality as manual simplification. it should be valuable in phylogenetic studies of large protein families. the software is available at .
