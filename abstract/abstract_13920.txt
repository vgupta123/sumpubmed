BACKGROUND
brucellosis caused by brucella abortus is one of the most important zoonoses in the world. multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis  has been shown be a useful tool to epidemiological traceback studies in b. abortus infection. thus, the present study aimed  to evaluate the genetic diversity of b. abortus isolates from a brucellosis outbreak, and  to investigate the in vivo stability of the mlva <dig> markers.


RESULTS
three-hundred and seventy-five clinical samples, including  <dig> vaginal swabs and  <dig> milk samples, were cultured from a brucellosis outbreak in a cattle herd, which adopted rb <dig> vaccination and test-and-slaughter policies. thirty-seven b. abortus isolates were obtained, eight from milk and twenty-nine from post-partum/abortion vaginal swabs, which were submitted to biotyping and genotyping by mlva <dig>  twelve b. abortus isolates obtained from vaginal swabs were identified as rb <dig>  twenty four isolates, seven obtained from milk samples and seventeen from vaginal swabs, were identified as b. abortus biovar  <dig>  while one isolate from vaginal swabs was identified as b. abortus biovar  <dig>  three distinct genotypes were observed during the brucellosis outbreak: rb observed in all isolates identified as rb51; w observed in all b. abortus biovar  <dig> isolates; and z observed in the single b. abortus biovar  <dig> isolate. epidemiological and molecular data show that the b. abortus biovar  <dig> genotype z strain is not related to the b. abortus biovar  <dig> genotype w isolates, and represents a new introduction b. abortus during the outbreak.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study on typing of multiple clinical b. abortus isolates from the same outbreak over a sixteen month period indicate the in vivo stability of mlva <dig> markers, a low genetic diversity among b. abortus isolates and the usefulness of mlva <dig> for epidemiological studies of bovine brucellosis.
