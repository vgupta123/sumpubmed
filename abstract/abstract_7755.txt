BACKGROUND
through in vivo loss-of-function studies, vertebrate members of the male abnormal  <dig>  gene family have been implicated in gastrulation, neural tube formation and eye morphogenesis. despite mounting evidence of their considerable importance in development, the biochemical properties and nature of mab- <dig> proteins have remained strikingly elusive. in addition, genetic studies conducted in c. elegans have established that in double mutants mab- <dig> is epistatic to genes encoding various members of a transforming growth factor beta  signaling pathway involved in the formation of male-specific sensory organs.


RESULTS
through a gain-of-function approach, we analyze the interaction of mab21l <dig> with a tgf-beta signaling pathway in early vertebrate development. we show that the vertebrate mab- <dig> homolog mab21l <dig> antagonizes the effects of bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  overexpression in vivo, rescuing the dorsal axis and restoring wild-type distribution of chordin and xvent <dig> transcripts in xenopus gastrulae. we show that mab21l <dig> immunoprecipitates in vivo with the bmp <dig> effector smad <dig>  whilst in vitro it binds smad <dig> and the smad1-smad <dig> complex. finally, when targeted to an heterologous promoter, mab21l <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide the first biochemical and cellular foundation for future functional studies of mab- <dig> genes in normal neural development and its pathological disturbances.
