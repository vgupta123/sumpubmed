BACKGROUND
in the last decade, sequencing projects have led to the development of a number of annotation systems dedicated to the structural and functional annotation of protein-coding genes. these annotation systems manage the annotation of the non-protein coding genes  in a very crude way, allowing neither the edition of the secondary structures nor the clustering of ncrna genes into families which are crucial for appropriate annotation of these molecules.


RESULTS
learn is a flexible software package which handles the complete process of ncrna annotation by integrating the layers of automatic detection and human curation.


CONCLUSIONS
this software provides the infrastructure to deal properly with ncrnas in the framework of any annotation project. it fills the gap between existing prediction software, that detect independent ncrna occurrences, and public ncrna repositories, that do not offer the flexibility and interactivity required for annotation projects. the software is freely available from the download section of the website
