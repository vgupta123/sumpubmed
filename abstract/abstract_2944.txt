BACKGROUND
in the past decades, the prevalence of candidemia has increased significantly and drug resistance has also become a pressing problem.  overexpression of cdr <dig>  an efflux pump, has been proposed as a major mechanism contributing to the drug resistance in candida albicans. it has been demonstrated that biological fluids such as human serum can have profound effects on antifungal pharmacodynamics. the aim of this study is to understand the effects of serum in drug susceptibility via monitoring the activity of cdr <dig> promoter of c. albicans.


RESULTS
the wild-type c. albicans cells  but not the cdr1/cdr <dig> mutant cells became more susceptible to the antifungal drug when the medium contained serum. to understand the regulation of cdr <dig> in the presence of serum, we have constructed cdr <dig> promoter-renilla luciferase  reporter to monitor the activity of the cdr <dig> promoter in c. albicans. as expected, the expression of cdr1p-rluc was induced by miconazole. surprisingly, it was repressed by serum. consistently, the level of cdr <dig> mrna was also reduced in the presence of serum but not n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, a known inducer for germ tube formation.


CONCLUSIONS
our finding that the expression of cdr <dig> is repressed by serum raises the question as to how does cdr <dig> contribute to the drug resistance in c. albicans causing candidemia. this also suggests that it is important to re-assess the prediction of in vivo therapeutic outcome of candidemia based on the results of standard in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing, conducted in the absence of serum.
