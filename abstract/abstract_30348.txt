BACKGROUND
the african wild dog  is an endangered african canid threatened by severe habitat fragmentation, human-wildlife conflict, and infectious disease. a highly specialized carnivore, it is distinguished by its social structure, dental morphology, absence of dewclaws, and colorful pelage.


RESULTS
we sequenced the genomes of two individuals from populations representing two distinct ecological histories . we reconstructed population demographic histories for the two individuals and scanned the genomes for evidence of selection.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that the african wild dog has undergone at least two effective population size reductions in the last  <dig> , <dig> years. we found evidence of lycaon individual-specific regions of low diversity, suggestive of inbreeding or population-specific selection. further research is needed to clarify whether these population reductions and low diversity regions are characteristic of the species as a whole. we documented positive selection on the lycaon mitochondrial genome. finally, we identified several candidate genes  that may play a role in the characteristic lycaon pelage.
