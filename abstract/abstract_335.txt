BACKGROUND
atg <dig> belongs to the uncoordinated-51-like kinase protein family. members of this family are best characterized for roles in macroautophagy and neuronal development. apoptosis-induced proliferation  is a caspase-directed and jnk-dependent process which is involved in tissue repair and regeneration after massive stress-induced apoptotic cell loss. under certain conditions, aip can cause tissue overgrowth with implications for cancer.


RESULTS
here, we show that atg <dig> in drosophila  has a previously unrecognized function for both regenerative and overgrowth-promoting aip in eye and wing imaginal discs. datg <dig> acts genetically downstream of and is transcriptionally induced by jnk activity, and it is required for jnk-dependent production of mitogens such as wingless for aip. interestingly, this function of datg <dig> in aip is independent of its roles in autophagy and in neuronal development.


CONCLUSIONS
in addition to a role of datg <dig> in autophagy and neuronal development, we report a third function of datg <dig> for aip.
