BACKGROUND
aberrant activation of signaling pathways downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor  has been hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms of cetuximab  resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma . to infer relevant and specific pathway activation downstream of egfr from gene expression in hnscc, we generated gene expression signatures using immortalized keratinocytes  subjected to ligand stimulation and transfected with egfr, rela/p <dig>  or hrasval12d.


RESULTS
the gene expression patterns that distinguished the hacat variants and conditions were inferred using the markov chain monte carlo  matrix factorization algorithm coordinated gene activity in pattern sets . this approach inferred gene expression signatures with greater relevance to cell signaling pathway activation than the expression signatures inferred with standard linear models. furthermore, the pathway signature generated using hacat-hrasval12d further associated with the cetuximab treatment response in isogenic cetuximab-sensitive  and -resistant  cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that the cogaps algorithm can generate gene expression signatures that are pertinent to downstream effects of receptor signaling pathway activation and potentially be useful in modeling resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies.
