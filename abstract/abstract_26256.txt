BACKGROUND
the ability to respond to changes in the extra-intracellular environment is prerequisite for cell survival. cellular responses to the environment include elevating defense systems, such as the antioxidant defense system. hypoxia-evoked reactive oxygen species -driven oxidative stress is an underlying mechanism of retinal ganglion cell  death that leads to blinding disorders. the protein peroxiredoxin  <dig>  plays a pleiotropic role in negatively regulating death signaling in response to stressors, and thereby stabilizes cellular homeostasis.


RESULTS
we have shown that rgcs exposed to hypoxia  or hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride display reduced expression of prdx <dig> with higher ros expression and activation of nf-κb. these cells undergo apoptosis, while cells with over-expression of prdx <dig> demonstrate resistance against hypoxia-driven rgc death. the rgcs exposed to hypoxia either with 1% oxygen or cobalt chloride , revealed ~30%-70% apoptotic cell death after  <dig> and  <dig> h of exposure. western analysis and real-time pcr showed elevated expression of prdx <dig> during hypoxia at  <dig> h, while prdx <dig> protein and mrna expression declined from  <dig> h onwards following hypoxia exposure. concomitant with this, rgcs showed increased ros expression and activation of nf-κb with ikb phosphorylation/degradation, as examined with h2dcf-da and transactivation assays. these hypoxia-induced adverse reactions could be reversed by over-expression of prdx <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
because an abundance of prdx <dig> in cells was able to attenuate hypoxia-induced rgc death, the protein could possibly be developed as a novel therapeutic agent acting to postpone rgc injury and delay the progression of glaucoma and other disorders caused by the increased-ros-generated death signaling related to hypoxia.
