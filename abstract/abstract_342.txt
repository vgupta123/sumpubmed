BACKGROUND
for wide-ranging species, intraspecific variation can occur as a result of reproductive isolation from local adaptive differences or from physical barriers to movement. cutthroat trout , a widely distributed fish species from north america, has been divided into numerous putative subspecies largely based on its isolation in different watersheds. in this study, we examined mtdna sequence variation of cutthroat trout to determine the major phylogenetic lineages of this polytypic species. we use these data as a means of testing whether geographic isolation by watershed boundaries can be a primary factor organizing intraspecific diversification.


RESULTS
we collected cutthroat trout from locations spanning almost the entire geographic range of this species and included samples from all major subspecies of cutthroat trout. based on our analyses, we reveal eight major lineages of cutthroat trout, six of which correspond to subspecific taxonomy commonly used to describe intraspecific variation in this species. the bonneville cutthroat trout  and yellowstone cutthroat trout  did not form separate monophyletic lineages, but instead formed an intermixed clade. we also document the geographic distribution of a great basin lineage of cutthroat trout; a group typically defined as bonneville cutthroat trout, but it appears more closely related to the colorado river lineage of cutthroat trout.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that watershed boundaries can be an organizing factor isolating genetic diversity in fishes; however, historical connections between watersheds can also influence the template of isolation. widely distributed species, like cutthroat trout, offer an opportunity to assess where historic watershed connections may have existed, and help explain the current distribution of biological diversity across a landscape.
