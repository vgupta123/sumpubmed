BACKGROUND
as a newly identified category of dna transposon, helitrons have been found in a large number of eukaryotes genomes. helitrons have contributed significantly to the intra-specific genome diversity in maize. although many characteristics of helitrons in the maize genome have been well documented, the sequence of an intact autonomous helitrons has not been identified in maize. in addition, the process of gene fragment capturing during the transposition of helitrons has not been characterized.


RESULTS
the whole genome sequences of maize inbred line b <dig> were analyzed,  <dig>  helitron-like transposons including  <dig>  helas and  <dig> helbs were identified. zmhela <dig>  zmhelb <dig> and zmhelb <dig> all encode an open reading frame  with intact replication initiator  motif and a dna helicase  domain, which are similar to previously reported autonomous helitrons in other organisms. the putative autonomous zmhelb <dig> and zmhelb <dig> contain an extra replication factor-a protein <dig>  transposase  including three single strand dna-binding domains -a/-b/-c in the orf. over ninety percent of maize helitrons identified have captured gene fragments. helas and helbs carry  <dig>  and  <dig> gene fragments, which yield  <dig>  and  <dig> different genes respectively. many helitrons contain mutilple terminal sequences, but only one 3'-terminal sequence had an intact "ctag" motif. there were no significant differences in the 5'-termini sequence between the veritas terminal sequence and the pseudo sequence. helitrons not only can capture fragments, but were also shown to lose internal sequences during the course of transposing.


CONCLUSIONS
three putative autonomous elements were identified, which encoded an intact rep motif and a dna helicase domain, suggesting that autonomous helitrons may exist in modern maize. the results indicate that gene fragments captured during the transposition of many helitrons happen in a stepwise way, with multiple gene fragments within one helitron resulting from several sequential transpositions. in addition, we have proposed a potential mechanism regarding how helitrons with multiple termini are generated.
