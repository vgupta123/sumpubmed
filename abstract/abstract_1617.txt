BACKGROUND
rye  is the most frost tolerant cereal species. as an outcrossing species, rye exhibits high levels of intraspecific diversity, which makes it well-suited for allele mining in genes involved in the frost responsive network. for investigating genetic diversity and the extent of linkage disequilibrium  we analyzed eleven candidate genes and  <dig> microsatellite markers in  <dig> lines from five eastern and middle european rye populations.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and nine insertion-deletion polymorphisms were found within  <dig>  bp of dna sequence from eleven candidate genes, resulting in an average snp frequency of  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp. nucleotide and haplotype diversity of candidate genes were high with average values π =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and hd =  <dig> , respectively. according to an analysis of molecular variance , most of the genetic variation was found between individuals within populations. haplotype frequencies varied markedly between the candidate genes. sccbf <dig>  scvrn <dig>  and scdhn <dig> were dominated by a single haplotype, while the other  <dig> genes  had a more balanced haplotype frequency distribution. intra-genic ld decayed rapidly, within approximately  <dig> bp on average. genome-wide ld based on microsatellites was low.


CONCLUSIONS
the middle european population did not differ substantially from the four eastern european populations in terms of haplotype frequencies or in the level of nucleotide diversity. the low ld in rye compared to self-pollinating species promises a high resolution in genome-wide association mapping. snps discovered in the promoters or coding regions, which attribute to non-synonymous substitutions, are suitable candidates for association mapping.
