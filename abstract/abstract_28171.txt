BACKGROUND
the recent explosion of experimental techniques in single molecule biophysics has generated a variety of novel time series data requiring equally novel computational tools for analysis and inference. this article describes in general terms how graphical modeling may be used to learn from biophysical time series data using the variational bayesian expectation maximization algorithm . the discussion is illustrated by the example of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer  versus time data, where the smfret time series is modeled as a hidden markov model  with gaussian observables. a detailed description of smfret is provided as well.


RESULTS
the vbem algorithm returns the model’s evidence and an approximating posterior parameter distribution given the data. the former provides a metric for model selection via maximum evidence , and the latter a description of the model’s parameters learned from the data. me/vbem provide several advantages over the more commonly used approach of maximum likelihood  optimized by the expectation maximization  algorithm, the most important being a natural form of model selection and a well-posed  optimization problem.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate the utility of graphical modeling for inference of dynamic processes in single molecule biophysics.
