BACKGROUND
although it has proven to be an important foundation for investigations of carnivoran ecology, biology and evolution, the complete species-level supertree for carnivora of bininda-emonds et al. is showing its age. additional, largely molecular sequence data are now available for many species and the advancement of computer technology means that many of the limitations of the original analysis can now be avoided. we therefore sought to provide an updated estimate of the phylogenetic relationships within all extant carnivora, again using supertree analysis to be able to analyze as much of the global phylogenetic database for the group as possible.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig> source trees were combined, representing  <dig> trees from the literature together with  <dig> newly constructed gene trees derived from nearly  <dig>  bp of sequence data from genbank. the greater availability of sequence data means that the new supertree is almost completely resolved and also better reflects current phylogenetic opinion . following an initial rapid radiation, diversification rate analyses indicate a downturn in the net speciation rate within the past three million years as well as a possible increase some  <dig>  million years ago; numerous diversification rate shifts within the order were also identified.


CONCLUSIONS
together, the two carnivore supertrees remain the only complete phylogenetic estimates for all extant species and the new supertree, like the old one, will form a key tool in helping us to further understand the biology of this charismatic group of carnivores.
