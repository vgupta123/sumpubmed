BACKGROUND
transposons, i.e. transposable elements , are the major internal spontaneous mutation agents for the variability of eukaryotic genomes. to address the general issue of whether transposons mediate genomic changes in environment-adaptation genes, we scanned two alleles per each of the six xenobiotic-metabolizing helicoverpa zea cytochrome p <dig> loci, including cyp6b <dig>  cyp6b <dig>  cyp321a <dig>  cyp321a <dig>  cyp9a12v <dig> and cyp9a <dig>  for the presence of transposon insertions by genome walking and sequence analysis. we also scanned thirteen drosophila melanogaster p450s genes for te insertions by in silico mapping and literature search.


RESULTS
twelve novel transposons, including lines , sines , mites , one full-length transib-like transposon, and one full-length tcl-like dna transpson, are identified from the alleles of the six h. zea p <dig> genes. the twelve transposons are inserted into the 5'flanking region, 3'flanking region, exon, or intron of the six environment-adaptation p <dig> genes. in d. melanogaster, seven out of the eight drosophila p450s  implicated in insecticide resistance are associated with a variety of transposons. by contrast, all the five drosophila p450s  involved in ecdysone biosynthesis and developmental regulation are free of te insertions.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that tes are selectively retained within or in close proximity to xenobiotic-metabolizing p <dig> genes.
