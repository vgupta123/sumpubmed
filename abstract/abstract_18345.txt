BACKGROUND
mrnas are highly versatile, non-toxic molecules that are easy to produce and store, which can allow transient protein expression in all cell types. the safety aspects of mrna-based treatments in gene therapy make this molecule one of the most promising active components of therapeutic or prophylactic methods. the use of mrna as strategy for the stimulation of the immune system has been used mainly in current strategies for the cancer treatment but until now no one tested this molecule as vaccine for infectious disease.


RESULTS
we produce messenger rna of hsp <dig> protein from mycobacterium leprae and show that vaccination of mice with a single dose of  <dig> Î¼g of naked mrna-hsp <dig> through intranasal route was able to induce protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis. moreover it was shown that this immunization was associated with specific production of il- <dig> and tnf-alpha in spleen. in order to determine if antigen presenting cells  present in the lung are capable of capture the mrna, labeled mrna-hsp <dig> was administered by intranasal route and lung apcs were analyzed by flow cytometry. these experiments showed that after  <dig> minutes until  <dig> hours the populations of cd11c+, cd11b+ and cd19+ cells were able to capture the mrna. we also demonstrated in vitro that mrna-hsp <dig> leads nitric oxide  production through toll-like receptor  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results showed a novel and efficient strategy to control experimental tuberculosis, besides opening novel perspectives for the use of mrna in vaccines against infectious diseases and clarifying the mechanisms involved in the disease protection we noticed as well.
