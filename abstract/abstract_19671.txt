BACKGROUND
mpg is a cell-permeable peptide with proven efficiency to deliver macromolecular cargoes into cells. in this work, we examined the efficacy of mpg as an n-terminal tag in a fusion protein to deliver a protein cargo and its mechanism of transduction.


RESULTS
we examined transduction of mpg-egfp fusion protein by live imaging, flow cytometry, along with combination of cell biological and pharmacological methods. we show that mpg-egfp fusion proteins efficiently enter various mammalian cells within a few minutes and are co-localized with fm4- <dig>  a general marker of endosomes. the transduction of mpg-egfp occurs rapidly and is inhibited at a low temperature. the entry of mpg-egfp is inhibited by amiloride, but cytochalasin d and methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin did not inhibit the entry, suggesting that macropinocytosis is not involved in the transduction. overexpression of a mutant form of dynamin partially reduced the transduction of mpg-egfp. the partial blockade of mpg-egfp transduction by a dynamin mutant is abolished by the treatment of amiloride. mpg-egfp transduction is also observed in the mammalian oocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that the transduction of mpg fusion protein utilizes endocytic pathway which is amiloride-sensitive and partially dynamin-dependent. collectively, the mpg fusion protein could be further developed as a novel tool of "protein therapeutics", with potentials to be used in various cell systems including mammalian oocytes.
