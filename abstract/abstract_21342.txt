BACKGROUND
the recent discovery of widespread copy number variation in humans has forced a shift away from the assumption of two copies per locus per cell throughout the autosomal genome. in particular, a snp site can no longer always be accurately assigned one of three genotypes in an individual. in the presence of copy number variability, the individual may theoretically harbor any number of copies of each of the two snp alleles.


RESULTS
to address this issue, we have developed a method to infer a "generalized genotype" from raw snp microarray data. here we apply our approach to data from  <dig> individuals and uncover thousands of aberrant snps, most in regions that were previously unreported as copy number variants. we show that our allele-specific copy numbers follow mendelian inheritance patterns that would be obscured in the absence of snp allele information. the interplay between duplication and point mutation in our data shed light on the relative frequencies of these events in human history, showing that at least some of the duplication events were recurrent.


CONCLUSIONS
this new multi-allelic view of snps has a complicated role in disease association studies, and further work will be necessary in order to accurately assess its importance. software to perform generalized genotyping from snp array data is freely available online  <cit> .
