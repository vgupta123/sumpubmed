BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality through its ability to cause a number of human infections including bacteremia, pneumonia and soft tissue infections. of great concern is the emergence and dissemination of methicillin–resistant staphylococcus aureus strains  that are resistant to nearly all β-lactams. the emergence of the usa <dig> mrsa genetic background among community associated s. aureus infections  in the usa was followed by the disappearance of usa <dig> ca-mrsa isolates.


RESULTS
to gain a greater understanding of the potential fitness advantages and virulence capacity of s. aureus usa <dig> clones, we performed whole genome sequencing of  <dig> usa <dig> and  <dig> usa <dig> clinical isolates. a comparison of representative genomes of the usa <dig> and usa <dig> pulsotypes indicates a number of differences in mobile genome elements. we examined the in vitro gene expression profiles by microarray hybridization and the in vivo transcriptomes during lung infection in mice of a usa <dig> and a usa <dig> mrsa strain by performing complete genome qrt-pcr analysis. the unique presence and increased expression of  <dig> exotoxins in usa <dig>  compared to usa <dig> may contribute to the increased virulence of usa <dig> clones. importantly, we also observed the up-regulation of prophage genes in usa <dig>  during mouse lung infection , suggesting that these prophages may play an important role in vivo by contributing to the elevated virulence characteristic of the usa <dig> clone.


CONCLUSIONS
we observed differences in the genetic content of usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains, as well as significant differences of in vitro and in vivo gene expression of mobile elements in a lung pneumonia model. this is the first study to document the global transcription differences between usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains during both in vitro and in vivo growth.
