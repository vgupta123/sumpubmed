BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  an atypical u.s. case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  was discovered in alabama and later reported to be polymorphic for glutamate  and lysine  codons at position  <dig> in the bovine prion protein gene  coding sequence. a bovine e211k mutation is important because it is analogous to the most common pathogenic mutation in humans  which causes hereditary creutzfeldt â€“ jakob disease, an autosomal dominant form of prion disease. the present report describes a high-throughput matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay for scoring the prnp e211k variant and its use to determine an upper limit for the k <dig> allele frequency in u.s. cattle.


RESULTS
the k <dig> allele was not detected in  <dig> cattle, including those from five commercial beef processing plants  and  <dig> registered cattle from  <dig> breeds. multiple nearby polymorphisms in prnp coding sequence of  <dig> diverse purebred cattle  did not interfere with scoring e <dig> or k <dig> alleles. based on these results, the upper bounds for prevalence of the e211k variant was estimated to be extremely low, less than  <dig> in  <dig> cattle .


CONCLUSIONS
no groups or breeds of u.s. cattle are presently known to harbor the prnp k <dig> allele. because a carrier was not detected, the number of additional atypical bse cases with k <dig> will also be vanishingly low.
