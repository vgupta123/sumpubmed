BACKGROUND
all polypeptide backbones have the potential to form amyloid fibrils, which are associated with a number of degenerative disorders. however, the likelihood that amyloidosis would actually occur under physiological conditions depends largely on the amino acid composition of a protein. we explore using a naive bayesian classifier and a weighted decision tree for predicting the amyloidogenicity of immunoglobulin sequences.


RESULTS
the average accuracy based on leave-one-out  cross validation of a bayesian classifier generated from  <dig> amyloidogenic sequences is  <dig> %. this is consistent with the average accuracy of  <dig> % for a holdout test set comprised of  <dig> am and  <dig> non-amyloidogenic sequences. the loo cross validation accuracy increases to  <dig> % when the training set is augmented by the holdout test set. in comparison, the average classification accuracy for the holdout test set obtained using a decision tree is  <dig> %. non-amyloidogenic sequences are predicted with average loo cross validation accuracies between  <dig> % and  <dig> % using the bayesian classifier, depending on the training set size. the accuracy for the holdout test set was 89%. for the decision tree, the non-amyloidogenic prediction accuracy is  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
this exploratory study indicates that both classification methods may be promising in providing straightforward predictions on the amyloidogenicity of a sequence. nevertheless, the number of available sequences that satisfy the premises of this study are limited, and are consequently smaller than the ideal training set size. increasing the size of the training set clearly increases the accuracy, and the expansion of the training set to include not only more derivatives, but more alignments, would make the method more sound. the accuracy of the classifiers may also be improved when additional factors, such as structural and physico-chemical data, are considered. the development of this type of classifier has significant applications in evaluating engineered antibodies, and may be adapted for evaluating engineered proteins in general.
