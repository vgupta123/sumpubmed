BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic organisms, dna is packaged into chromatin structure, where most of dna is wrapped into nucleosomes. dna compaction and nucleosome positioning have clear functional implications, since they modulate the accessibility of genomic regions to regulatory proteins. despite the intensive research effort focused in this area, the rules defining nucleosome positioning and the location of dna regulatory regions still remain elusive.


RESULTS
naked  and nucleosomal dna from yeast were digested by microccocal nuclease  and sequenced genome-wide. mnase cutting preferences were determined for both naked and nucleosomal dnas. integration of their sequencing profiles with dna conformational descriptors derived from atomistic molecular dynamic simulations enabled us to extract the physical properties of dna on a genomic scale and to correlate them with chromatin structure and gene regulation. the local structure of dna around regulatory regions was found to be unusually flexible and to display a unique pattern of nucleosome positioning. ab initio physical descriptors derived from molecular dynamics were used to develop a computational method that accurately predicts nucleosome enriched and depleted regions.


CONCLUSIONS
our experimental and computational analyses jointly demonstrate a clear correlation between sequence-dependent physical properties of naked dna and regulatory signals in the chromatin structure. these results demonstrate that nucleosome positioning around tss  and tts   is strongly dependent on dna physical properties, which can define a basal regulatory mechanism of gene expression.
