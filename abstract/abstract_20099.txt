BACKGROUND
the embryonic chick provides an excellent model system for studies of development. however, it has lacked an efficient loss-of-function method for studies of gene function.


RESULTS
we show that avian retroviruses can deliver hairpins mediating rna interference to the developing chick eye. these viruses 'knock down' specific genes in infected areas of the retina. the knock down persists as the retina matures and can be detected using in situ hybridization. furthermore, the amount of retinal tissue affected can be controlled by manipulating the degree of infection.


CONCLUSIONS
this technique provides a rapid and efficient loss-of-function option for studies in the developing chick retina.
