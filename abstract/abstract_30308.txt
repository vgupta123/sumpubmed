BACKGROUND
chlorophyll is a major component of chloroplasts and a better understanding of the genetic basis of chlorophyll in soybean  might contribute to improving photosynthetic capacity and yield in regions with adverse environmental conditions. a collection of  <dig> diverse soybean genotypes were grown in 2 years  and chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , and total chlorophyll  content as well as chlorophyll a/b ratio  in leaf tissues were determined by extraction and spectrometric determination. total chlorophyll was also derived from canopy spectral reflectance measurements using a model of wavelet transformed spectra  as well as with a spectral reflectance index .


RESULTS
a genome-wide associating mapping approach was employed using  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  to identify loci associated with the extract based echl_a, echl_b, echl_r and echl_t measurements and the two canopy spectral reflectance-based methods . a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> snps  showed significant association with echl_a, echl_b and echl_r respectively. a total of  <dig> unique snps were significantly associated with total chlorophyll content based on at least one of the three approaches  and likely tagged  <dig> putative loci for total chlorophyll content, four of which were indicated by all three approaches.


CONCLUSIONS
results presented here show that markers for chlorophyll traits can be identified in soybean using both extract-based and canopy spectral reflectance-based phenotypes, and confirm that high-throughput phenotyping-amenable canopy spectral reflectance measurements can be used for association mapping.
