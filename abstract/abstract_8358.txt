BACKGROUND
dysregulation of the common stress responsive transcription factor atf <dig> has been causally linked to many important human diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, infections, and hypospadias. although it is believed that the atf <dig> transcription activity is central to its cellular functions, how atf <dig> regulates gene expression remains largely unknown. here, we employed atf <dig> wild-type and knockout isogenic cell lines to carry out the first comprehensive analysis of global atf3-binding profiles in the human genome under basal and stressed  conditions.


RESULTS
although expressed at a low basal level, atf <dig> was found to bind a large number of genomic sites that are often associated with genes involved in cellular stress responses. interestingly, atf <dig> appears to bind a large portion of genomic sites distal to transcription start sites and enriched with p <dig> and h3k27ac. global gene expression profiling analysis indicates that genes proximal to these genomic sites were often regulated by atf <dig>  while dna damage elicited by camptothecin dramatically altered the atf <dig> binding profile, most of the genes regulated by atf <dig> upon dna damage were pre-bound by atf <dig> before the stress. moreover, we demonstrated that atf <dig> was co-localized with the major stress responder p <dig> at genomic sites, thereby collaborating with p <dig> to regulate p <dig> target gene expression upon dna damage.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that atf <dig> likely bookmarks genomic sites and interacts with other transcription regulators to control gene expression.
