BACKGROUND
transcriptional interactome of chromatin is one of the important mechanisms in gene transcription regulation. by chromatin conformation capture and 3d fish experiments, several chromatin interactions cases among sequence-distant genes or even inter-chromatin genes were reported. however, on genomics level, there is still little evidence to support these mechanisms. recently based on hi-c experiment, a genome-wide picture of chromatin interactions in human cells was presented. it provides a useful material for analysing whether the mechanism of transcriptional interactome is common.


RESULTS
the main work here is to demonstrate whether the effects of transcriptional interactome on gene co-expression exist on genomic level. while controlling the effects of transcription factors control similarities , we tested the correlation between hi-c interaction and the mutual ranks of gene co-expression rates  of intra-chromatin gene pairs. we used  <dig>  genes with both tf annotation and co-expression information, and matched them into  <dig>  pairs with similar hi-c interaction ranks in different cell types. the results illustrate that co-expression is strongly associated with chromatin interaction. further analysis using go annotation reveals potential correlation between gene function similarity, hi-c interaction and their co-expression.


CONCLUSIONS
according to the results in this research, the intra-chromatin interactome may have relation to gene function and associate with co-expression. this study provides evidence for illustrating the effect of transcriptional interactome on transcription regulation.
