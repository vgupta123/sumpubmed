BACKGROUND
nomuraea rileyi is used as an environmental-friendly biopesticide. however, mass production and commercialization of this organism are limited due to its fastidious growth and sporulation requirements. when cultured in amended medium, we found that n. rileyi could produce microsclerotia bodies, replacing conidiophores as the infectious agent. however, little is known about the genes involved in microsclerotia development. in the present study, the transcriptomes were analyzed using next-generation sequencing technology to find the genes involved in microsclerotia development.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  gb of clean nucleotides comprising  <dig>  sequences was obtained, and  <dig>  sequences were annotated . among the annotated sequences, only  <dig> were annotated with  <dig> gene ontology  functional categories, and  <dig>  sequences were mapped to  <dig> pathways by searching against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway  database. furthermore, we assessed the transcriptomic differences between cultures grown in minimal and amended medium. in total,  <dig> sequences were found to be differentially expressed;  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were assigned to  <dig> go classes and  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways, including  <dig> enrichment pathways. subsequently, we examined the up-regulation or uniquely expressed genes following amended medium treatment, which were also expressed on the enrichment pathway, and found that most of them participated in mediating oxidative stress homeostasis. to elucidate the role of oxidative stress in microsclerotia development, we analyzed the diversification of unigenes using quantitative reverse transcription-pcr .


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that oxidative stress occurs during microsclerotia development, along with a broad metabolic activity change. our data provide the most comprehensive sequence resource available for the study of n. rileyi. we believe that the transcriptome datasets will serve as an important public information platform to accelerate studies on n. rileyi microsclerotia.
