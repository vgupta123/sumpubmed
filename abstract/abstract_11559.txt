BACKGROUND
gene fusion is ubiquitous over the course of evolution. it is expected to increase the diversity and complexity of transcriptomes and proteomes through chimeric sequence segments or altered regulation. however, chimeric mrnas in pigs remain unclear. here we identified some chimeric mrnas in pigs and analyzed the expression of them across individuals and breeds using rna-sequencing data.


RESULTS
the present study identified  <dig> putative chimeric mrnas in pigs, of which  <dig> chimeric candidates were detected in a set of rna-sequencing data. the  <dig> candidates had clear trans-splicing sites,  <dig> of which obeyed the canonical gu-ag splice rule. only two putative pig chimera variants whose fusion junction was overlapped with that of a known human chimeric mrna were found. a set of unique chimeric events were considered middle variances in the expression across individuals and breeds, and revealed non-significant variance between sexes. furthermore, the genomic region of the 5′ partner gene shares a similar dna sequence with that of the 3′ partner gene for  <dig> putative chimeric mrnas. the  <dig> of those shared dna sequences significantly matched the known dna-binding motifs in the jaspar core database. four dna motifs shared in parental genomic regions had significant similarity with known human ctcf binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provided detailed information on some pig chimeric mrnas. we proposed a model that trans-acting factors, such as ctcf, induced the spatial organisation of parental genes to the same transcriptional factory so that parental genes were coordinatively transcribed to give birth to chimeric mrnas.
