BACKGROUND
since the first reported outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever in pakistan, several mini outbreaks have erupted in the region. dengue virus serotype  <dig>  was first documented in  <dig> outbreak in karachi. reports show that serotype  <dig> is prevalent in lahore since  <dig>  serotype  <dig>  is the major circulating serotype in pakistan as it is documented since  <dig>  we have conducted a detailed study of three outbreaks of dengue virus infection that occurred in years  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in lahore by using molecular techniques such as pcr and nucleotide sequencing of the c-prm gene junction of dengue virus.


RESULTS
through the analysis of  <dig> serum samples collected over the period of three years , total  <dig> patients were found to be infected with dengue virus. in year  <dig>  four were positive for serotype  <dig> and one sample was positive for serotype den- <dig>  in  <dig>  five samples had concurrent infection with serotypes den- <dig> and den- <dig> while three samples were infected only with serotype den- <dig>  in year  <dig>  one sample had concurrent infection with serotypes den- <dig> and den- <dig> while six were positive for serotype den- <dig> only.


CONCLUSIONS
our study showed that serotype den- <dig> was dominant in positive samples of dengue virus infection collected during the period of three years . the other serotype present was serotype den- <dig>  genotypes of serotype den- <dig> and serotype den- <dig> were subtype iv and subtype iii, respectively.
