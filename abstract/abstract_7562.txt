BACKGROUND
q-sweat is a model used for evaluating the post-ganglionic sudomotor function by assessing sweat response. this study aimed to establish the normative database of q-sweat test among chinese individuals since this type of information is currently lacking.


RESULTS
one hundred and fifty  healthy volunteers,  <dig> men and  <dig> women with age range of 22–76 years were included. skin temperature and sweat onset latency measured at the four sites  did not significantly correlate with age, gender, body height , body weight , and body mass index  but the total sweat volume measured in all four sites significantly correlated with sex, bh, and bw. except for the distal leg, the total sweat volume measured at the other three sites had a significant correlation with bmi. in terms of gender, men had larger total sweat volume, with median differences at the forearm, proximal leg, distal leg, and foot of  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl, and  <dig>  μl, respectively. regarding bw difference , those with bw ≥ <dig> kg had larger total sweat volume. median differences at the forearm, proximal leg, distal leg, and foot were  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl, and  <dig>  μl, respectively. there was an uneven distribution of male and female participants in the two bw groups. in all conditions, the total sweat volume recorded at the foot site was the smallest.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report to show the normative database of sweat response in chinese participants evaluated using q-sweat device. this normative database can help guide further research on post-ganglionic sudomotor or related clinical practice involving a chinese population.
