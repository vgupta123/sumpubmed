BACKGROUND
a significant portion of expressed non-coding rnas in human cells is derived from transposable elements . moreover, it has been shown that various long non-coding rnas , which come from the human endogenous retrovirus subfamily h , are not only expressed but required for pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells .


RESULTS
to identify additional te-derived functional non-coding transcripts, we generated rna-seq data from induced pluripotent stem cells  of four primate species  and searched for transcripts whose expression was conserved. we observed that about 30% of te instances expressed in human ipscs had orthologous te instances that were also expressed in chimpanzee and gorilla. notably, our analysis revealed a number of repeat families with highly conserved expression profiles including hervh but also mer <dig>  which is known to be the source of a placental-specific family of micrornas . we also identified a number of repeat families from all classes of tes, including mlt1-type and tigger families, that contributed a significant amount of sequence to primate lncrnas whose expression was conserved.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these results describe te families and te-derived lncrnas whose conserved expression patterns can be used to identify what are likely functional te-derived non-coding transcripts in primate ipscs.
