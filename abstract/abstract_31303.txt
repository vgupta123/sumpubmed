BACKGROUND
the efficiency of recovery and the detection limit of legionella after co-culture with acanthamoeba polyphaga are not known and so far no investigations have been carried out to determine the efficiency of the recovery of legionella spp. by co-culture and compare it with that of conventional culturing methods. this study aimed to assess the detection limits of co-culture compared to culture for legionella pneumophila in compost and air samples. compost and air samples were spiked with known concentrations of l. pneumophila. direct culturing and co-culture with amoebae were used in parallel to isolate l. pneumophila and recovery standard curves for both methods were produced for each sample.


RESULTS
the co-culture proved to be more sensitive than the reference method, detecting 102-103 l. pneumophila cells in 1 g of spiked compost or 1 m <dig> of spiked air, as compared to 105- <dig> cells in 1 g of spiked compost and 1 m <dig> of spiked air.


CONCLUSIONS
co-culture with amoebae is a useful, sensitive and reliable technique to enrich l. pneumophila in environmental samples that contain only low amounts of bacterial cells.
