BACKGROUND
cis-2-dodecenoic acid  is well known for its important functions in intraspecies signaling in burkholderia cenocepacia. previous work has also established an important role of bdsf in interspecies and inter-kingdom communications. it was identified that bdsf modulates virulence of pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, how bdsf interferes with virulence of p. aeruginosa is still not clear.


RESULTS
we report here that bdsf mediates the cross-talk between b. cenocepacia and p. aeruginosa through interference with quorum sensing  systems and type iii secretion system  of p. aeruginosa. bioassay results revealed that exogenous addition of bdsf not only reduced the transcriptional expression of the regulator encoding gene of qs systems, i.e., lasr, pqsr, and rhlr, but also simultaneously decreased the production of qs signals including 3-oxo-c12-hsl, pseudomonas quinolone signal  and c4-hsl, consequently resulting in the down-regulation of biofilm formation and virulence factor production of p. aeruginosa. furthermore, bdsf and some of its derivatives are also capable of inhibiting t3ss of p. aeruginosa at a micromolar level. treatment with bdsf obviously reduced the virulence of p. aeruginosa in both hela cell and zebrafish infection models.


CONCLUSIONS
these results depict that bdsf modulates virulence of p. aeruginosa through interference with qs systems and t3ss.
