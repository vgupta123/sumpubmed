BACKGROUND
vascular system formation has been studied through molecular and genetic approaches in arabidopsis, a herbaceous dicot that is used as a model system. different vascular systems have developed in other plants such as crops and trees. uncovering shared mechanisms underlying vascular development by transcriptome analysis of different vascular systems may help to transfer knowledge acquired from arabidopsis to other economically important species.


RESULTS
conserved vascular genes and biological processes fundamental to vascular development were explored across various plants. through comparative transcriptome analysis,  <dig> genes from arabidopsis,  <dig> genes from poplar and  <dig> genes from rice were identified as constituting  <dig> conserved vascular gene groups. these gene groups are expressed mainly in vascular tissues and form a complex coexpression network with multiple functional connections. to date, only half of the groups have been experimentally investigated. the conserved vascular gene groups were classified into  <dig> essential processes for vascular development.  <dig> groups  lack of annotations were classified as having unknown functions.


CONCLUSIONS
the study provides a map of fundamental biological processes conserved across different vascular systems. it identifies gaps in the experimental investigation of pathways active in vascular formation, which if explored, could lead to a more complete understanding of vascular development.
