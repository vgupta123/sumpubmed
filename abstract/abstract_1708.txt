BACKGROUND
the cardiopulmonary nematodes dirofilaria immitis and angiostrongylus vasorum are increasingly reported in dogs and are responsible for two diseases with overlapping endemic areas, especially in europe: dirofilariosis and angiostrongylosis. the reasons for their apparent emergence are unknown, but several factors  may play a role in the recent rise in reports of infection in the various countries of europe. the aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of d. immitis  and the fecal presence of first stage larvae  of a. vasorum  in dogs from  <dig> kennels of the campania region . the fecal samples were collected from pooled samples using the box as epidemiological unit. to the authors’s knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional survey conducted at regional-scale in italy and in europe on the contemporaneous detection of d. immitis antigens and a. vasorum l <dig> in kennels.


RESULTS
antigens of d. immitis were detected in 24/ <dig>  dogs in  <dig> out of the  <dig> kennels . the  <dig> positive samples for d. immitis antigen were tested also with angiodetect® and only  <dig> sample was seropositive for a. vasorum with a prevalence of  <dig>  %. a. vasorum l <dig> were detected in dogs from  <dig> out of the  <dig> kennels . pooled fecal samples from  <dig> boxes out of the  <dig> analyzed resulted positive to a. vasorum l <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates that cardiopulmonary nematodes are present in campania region in symptomatic dogs as well as in asymptomatic ones. therefore, regular parasitological surveillance, appropriate treatment strategies and high quality standard of hygiene are required to guarantee the health and welfare of kennel dogs.
