BACKGROUND
the white rhinoceros is on the verge of extinction with less than  <dig>  animals remaining in the wild. in order to better protect these endangered animals, it is necessary to better understand their digestive physiology and nutritional requirements. the gut microbiota is nutritionally important for herbivorous animals. however, little is known about the microbial diversity in the gastrointestinal tract  of the white rhinoceros. methanogen diversity in the git may be host species-specific and, or, function-dependent. to assess methanogen diversity in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses, an archaeal 16s rrna gene clone library was constructed from pooled pcr products obtained from the feces of seven adult animals.


RESULTS
sequence analysis of  <dig> archaeal 16s rrna sequences revealed  <dig> unique phylotypes, which were assigned to seven operational taxonomic units . sequences assigned to otu- <dig>  and otu- <dig>  had  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity to methanocorpusculum labreanum, respectively, making methanocorpusculum labreanum the predominant phylotype in these white rhynoceroses. sequences belonging to otu- <dig>  were related  to methanobrevibacter smithii. only 4% of the total sequences  were assigned to methanosphaera stadtmanae . sequences belonging to otu- <dig> , otu- <dig>  and otu- <dig>  were distantly related  to methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and were considered to be novel species or strains that have yet-to-be cultivated and characterized.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the methanogen species in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses were more similar to those in the hindgut of horses. our findings may help develop studies on improving the digestibility of forage for sustainable management and better health of these endangered animals.
