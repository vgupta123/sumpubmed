BACKGROUND
multivariate approaches have been successfully applied to genome wide association studies. recently, a partial least squares  based approach was introduced for mapping yeast genotype-phenotype relations, where background information such as gene function classification, gene dispensability, recent or ancient gene copy number variations and the presence of premature stop codons or frameshift mutations in reading frames, were used post hoc to explain selected genes. one of the latest advancement in pls named l-partial least squares , where ‘l’ presents the used data structure, enables the use of background information at the modeling level. here, a modification of l-pls with variable importance on projection  was implemented using a stepwise regularized procedure for gene and background information selection. results were compared to pls-based procedures, where no background information was used.


RESULTS
applying the proposed methodology to yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae data, we found the relationship between genotype-phenotype to have improved understandability. phenotypic variations were explained by the variations of relatively stable genes and stable background variations. the suggested procedure provides an automatic way for genotype-phenotype mapping. the selected phenotype influencing genes were evolving 29% faster than non-influential genes, and the current results are supported by a recently conducted study. further power analysis on simulated data verified that the proposed methodology selects relevant variables.


CONCLUSIONS
a modification of l-pls with vip in a stepwise regularized elimination procedure can improve the understandability and stability of selected genes and background information. the approach is recommended for genome wide association studies where background information is available.
