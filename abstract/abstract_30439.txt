BACKGROUND
sequence alignment algorithms are a key component of many bioinformatics applications.

though various fast smith-waterman local sequence alignment implementations have been developed for x <dig> cpus, most are embedded into larger database search tools. in addition, fast implementations of needleman-wunsch global sequence alignment and its semi-global variants are not as widespread. this article presents the first software library for local, global, and semi-global pairwise intra-sequence alignments and improves the performance of previous intra-sequence implementations.


RESULTS
a faster intra-sequence local pairwise alignment implementation is described and benchmarked, including new global and semi-global variants. using a  <dig> residue query sequence a speed of  <dig> billion cell updates per second  was achieved on a dual intel xeon e5- <dig> 24-core processor system, the highest reported for an implementation based on farrar’s ‘striped’ approach. rognes’s swipe optimal database search application is still generally the fastest available at  <dig>  to at best  <dig>  times faster than parasail for sequences shorter than  <dig> amino acids. however, parasail was faster for longer sequences. for global alignments, parasail’s prefix scan implementation is generally the fastest, faster even than farrar’s ‘striped’ approach, however the opal library is faster for single-threaded applications. the software library is designed for  <dig> bit linux, os x, or windows on processors with sse <dig>  sse <dig>  or avx <dig>  source code is available from https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail
under the battelle bsd-style license.


CONCLUSIONS
applications that require optimal alignment scores could benefit from the improved performance. for the first time, simd global, semi-global, and local alignments are available in a stand-alone c library.
