BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis squamosa promoter-binding protein-like  transcription factor spl <dig> reprograms cellular gene expression to adapt plant growth and cellular metabolism to copper  limited culture conditions. plant cells require cu to maintain essential processes, such as photosynthesis, scavenging reactive oxygen species, cell wall lignification and hormone sensing. more specifically, spl <dig> activity promotes a high-affinity cu-uptake system and optimizes cu distribution to essential cu-proteins by means of specific mirnas targeting mrna transcripts for those dispensable. however, the functional mechanism underlying spl <dig> activation is still to be elucidated. as spl <dig> transcript levels are largely non-responsive to cu availability, post-translational modification seems an obvious possibility. previously, it was reported that the spl <dig> sbp domain does not bind to dna in vitro in the presence of cu ions and that spl <dig> interacts with a kin <dig> domain protein to raise spl7-target gene expression upon cu deprivation. here we report how additional conserved spl <dig> protein domains may contribute to the cu deficiency response in arabidopsis.


RESULTS
cytological and biochemical approaches confirmed an operative transmembrane domain  and uncovered a dual localisation of spl <dig> between the nucleus and an endomembrane system, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum . this new perspective unveiled a possible link between cu deficit and er stress, a metabolic dysfunction found capable of inducing spl <dig> targets in an spl7-dependent manner. moreover, in vivo protein-protein interaction assays revealed that spl <dig> is able to homodimerize, probably mediated by the irpgc domain. these observations, in combination with the constitutive activation of spl <dig> targets, when ectopically expressing the n-terminal part of spl <dig> including the sbp domain, shed some light on the mechanisms governing spl <dig> function.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we propose a revised model of spl <dig> activation and regulation. according to our results, spl <dig> would be initially located to endomembranes and activated during er stress as a result of cu deficiency. furthermore, we added the spl <dig> dimerization in the presence of cu ions as an additional regulatory mechanism to modulate the cu deficiency response.
