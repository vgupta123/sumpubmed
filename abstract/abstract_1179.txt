BACKGROUND
secondary, phased small interfering rnas  derived from protein-coding or noncoding loci  are emerging as a new type of regulators of gene expression in plants. however, the evolution and function of these novel sirnas in plant species remain largely unexplored.


RESULTS
we systematically analyzed phas loci in  <dig> plant species covering major phylogenetic groups spanning alga, moss, gymnosperm, basal angiosperm, monocot, and dicot. we identified over  <dig>  phas loci, among which ~ <dig>  were protein-coding genes. most of these phas loci were novel and clade- or species-specific and showed distinct expression patterns in association with particular development stages, viral infection, or abiotic stresses. unexpectedly, numerous phas loci produced phasirnas from introns or exon–intron junction regions. our comprehensive analysis suggests that phasirnas predominantly regulate protein-coding genes from which they are derived and genes from the same families of the phasirna-deriving genes, in contrast to the dominant trans-regulatory mode of mirnas. the stochastic occurrence of many phas loci in the plant kingdom suggests their young evolutionary origins.


CONCLUSIONS
our study discovered an unprecedented diversity of protein-coding genes that produce phasirnas in a wide variety of plants, and set a kingdom-wide foundation for investigating the novel roles of phasirnas in shaping phenotype diversities of plants.
