BACKGROUND
we study the usage of specific peptide platforms in protein composition. using the pentapeptide as a unit of length, we find that in the universal proteome many pentapeptides are heavily repeated , whereas some are quite rare, and a small number do not appear at all. to understand the physico-chemical-biological basis underlying peptide usage at the proteomic level, in this study we analyse the energetic costs for the synthesis of rare and never-expressed versus frequent pentapeptides. in addition, we explore residue bulkiness, hydrophobicity, and codon number as factors able to modulate specific peptide frequencies. then, the possible influence of amino acid composition is investigated in zero- and high-frequency pentapeptide sets by analysing the frequencies of the corresponding inverse-sequence pentapeptides. as a final step, we analyse the pentadecamer oligodeoxynucleotide sequences corresponding to the never-expressed pentapeptides.


RESULTS
we find that only dna context-dependent constraints  provide a coherent mechanistic platform to explain the occurrence of never-expressed versus frequent pentapeptides in the protein world.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is of importance in cell biology. indeed, the rarity  of specific 5-mer peptide modules implies the rarity  of the corresponding n-mer peptide sequences , so possibly modulating protein compositional trends. moreover the data might further our understanding of the role exerted by rare pentapeptide modules as critical biological effectors in protein-protein interactions.
