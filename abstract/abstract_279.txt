BACKGROUND
salmonella spp. and oxyurids are among the most prevalent bacterial and parasitic agents in reptiles. these organisms are routinely isolated in healthy tortoises, although heavy infections may cause significant pathology. tortoises are considered a common source of reptile-associated salmonellosis, an important zoonosis reported worldwide. a survey of the prevalence of salmonella spp. and oxyurids in  <dig> tortoises was conducted in southern italy and a possible correlation between the two pathogens was therefore investigated.


RESULTS
salmonella spp. and oxyurids were detected with a prevalence of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. a significant positive correlation between salmonella spp. and oxyurids was demonstrated. however, confounding factors related to husbandry could have been involved in determining this correlation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that caution should be exercised in translocation, husbandry, and human contact with tortoises and other exotic pets. further studies on the epidemiology, molecular characterization and pathogenesis of salmonella and oxyurids are needed to assess the actual impact of these organisms, as single or associated infections, on tortoises and on other exotic pets.
