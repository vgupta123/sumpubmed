BACKGROUND
natural history has a long tradition in the uk, dating back to before charles darwin. developing from a principally amateur pursuit, natural history continues to attract both amateur and professional involvement. within the context of citizen science and public engagement, we examine the motivations behind citizen participation in the national survey activities of the open air laboratories  programme, looking at: people’s experiences of the surveys as ‘project-based leisure’; their motivations for taking part and barriers to continued participation; where they feature on our continuum of engagement; and whether participation in an opal survey facilitated their movement between categories along this continuum. the paper focuses on a less-expected but very significant outcome regarding the participation of already-engaged amateur naturalists in citizen science.


RESULTS
our main findings relate to: first, how committed amateur naturalists  have also enjoyed contributing to opal and the need to respect and work with their interest to encourage broader and deeper involvement; and second, how new  and relatively new participants  have gained confidence, renewed their interests, refocussed their activities and/or gained validation from participation in opal. overall, we argue that engagement with and enthusiasm for the scientific process is a motivation shared by citizens who, prior to participating in the opal surveys, were previously-unengaged, casually-engaged or already-engaged in natural history activities.


CONCLUSIONS
citizen science has largely been written about by professional scientists for professional scientists interested in developing a project of their own. this study offers a qualitative example of how citizen science can be meaningful to participants beyond what might appear to be a public engagement data collection exercise.
