BACKGROUND
recent association analyses in genome-wide association studies  mainly focus on single-locus association tests  and two-locus interaction detections. these analysis methods have provided strong evidence of associations between genetics variances and complex diseases. however, there exists a type of association pattern, which often occurs within local regions in the genome and is unlikely to be detected by either marginal tests or interaction tests. this association pattern involves a group of correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms . the correlation among snps can lead to weak marginal effects and the interaction does not play a role in this association pattern. this phenomenon is due to the existence of unfaithfulness: the marginal effects of correlated snps do not express their significant joint effects faithfully due to the correlation cancelation.


RESULTS
in this paper, we develop a computational method to detect this association pattern masked by unfaithfulness. we have applied our method to analyze seven data sets from the wellcome trust case control consortium . the analysis for each data set takes about one week to finish the examination of all pairs of snps. based on the empirical result of these real data, we show that this type of association masked by unfaithfulness widely exists in gwas.


CONCLUSIONS
these newly identified associations enrich the discoveries of gwas, which may provide new insights both in the analysis of tagsnps and in the experiment design of gwas. since these associations may be easily missed by existing analysis tools, we can only connect some of them to publicly available findings from other association studies. as independent data set is limited at this moment, we also have difficulties to replicate these findings. more biological implications need further investigation.
