BACKGROUND
sporopollenin is a major component of the pollen exine pattern. in arabidopsis, acyl-coa synthetase <dig>  is involved in sporopollenin precursor biosynthesis. in this study, we identified its orthologue, osacos <dig>  in rice  and compared the functional conservation of acos in rice to arabidopsis.


RESULTS
sequence analysis showed that osacos <dig> shares  <dig>  % amino acid sequence identity with acos <dig>  the osacos <dig> mutation caused by a pre-mature stop codon in loc_os04g <dig> exhibits defective sexine resulting in a male sterile phenotype in rice. in situ hybridization shows that osacos <dig> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores at the transcript level. the localization of osacos12-gfp demonstrated that osacos <dig> protein is accumulated in tapetal cells and anther locules. osacos <dig> driven by the acos <dig> promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos <dig> mutant in arabidopsis.


CONCLUSIONS

osacos <dig> is an orthologue of acos <dig> that is essential for sporopollenin synthesis in rice. acos <dig> and osacos <dig> are conserved for pollen wall formation in monocot and dicot species.
