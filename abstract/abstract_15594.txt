BACKGROUND
human muty glycosylase homolog , a component of the base excision repair pathway, is responsible for the generation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites. rad9-rad1-hus <dig>  is a heterotrimeric protein complex that plays a role in cell cycle checkpoint control and dna repair. in humans, hmyh and 9-1- <dig> interact through hus <dig> and to a lesser degree with rad <dig> in the presence of dna damage. in saccharomyces pombe, each component of the 9-1- <dig> complex interacts directly with spmyh. the glycosylase activity of hmyh is stimulated by hus <dig> and the 9-1- <dig> complex and enhanced by dna damage treatment. cells respond to different stress conditions in different manners. therefore, we investigated whether rad <dig> interacted with hmyh under different stresses. here, we identified and visualized the interaction between hrad <dig> and hmyh and investigated the functional consequences of this interaction.


RESULTS
co-ip and bifc indicates that hmyh interacts with hrad <dig>  as shown by gst-pull down assay, this interaction is direct. furthermore, bifc with deletion mutants of hmyh showed that hrad <dig> interacts with n-terminal region of hmyh. the interaction was enhanced by hydroxyurea  treatment. mrna and protein levels of hmyh and hrad <dig> were increased following hu treatment. a marked increase in p-chk <dig>  and p-cdk <dig>  was observed. but this phosphorylation decreased in simyh- or sirad9-transfected cells, and more pronounced decrease observed in co-transfected cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data reveal that hrad <dig> interacts directly with n-terminal region of hmyh. this interaction is enhanced by hu treatment. knockdown of one or both protein result in decreasing chk <dig> and cdk <dig> phosphorylation. since both protein functions in the early detection of dna damage, we suggest that this interaction occurs early in dna damage pathway.
