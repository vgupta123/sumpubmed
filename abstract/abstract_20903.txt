BACKGROUND
the accurate characterization of rna transcripts and expression levels across species is critical for understanding transcriptome evolution. as available rna-seq data accumulate rapidly, there is a great demand for tools that build gene annotations for cross-species rna-seq analysis. however, prevailing methods of ortholog annotation for rna-seq analysis between closely-related species do not take inter-species variation in mappability into consideration.


RESULTS
here we present xsanno, a computational framework that integrates previous approaches with multiple filters to improve the accuracy of inter-species transcriptome comparisons. the implementation of this approach in comparing rna-seq data of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque brain transcriptomes has reduced the false discovery of differentially expressed genes, while maintaining a low false negative rate.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates the utility of the xsanno pipeline in building ortholog annotations and improving the accuracy of cross-species transcriptome comparisons.
