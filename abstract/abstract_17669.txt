BACKGROUND
protein-dna interactions are essential for fundamental biological activities including dna transcription, replication, packaging, repair and rearrangement. proteins interacting with dna can be classified into two categories of binding mechanisms - sequence-specific and non-specific binding. protein-dna specific binding provides a mechanism to recognize correct nucleotide base pairs for sequence-specific identification. protein-dna non-specific binding shows sequence independent interaction for accelerated targeting by interacting with dna backbone. both sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues contribute to their roles for interaction.


RESULTS
the proposed framework has two stage predictors: dna-binding residues prediction and binding mode prediction. in the first stage - dna-binding residues prediction, the predictor for dna specific binding residues achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % precision, and  <dig> % f-measure. the predictor for dna non-specific binding residues achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % precision, and  <dig> % f-measure. while combining prediction results of sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues with or operation, the predictor achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % precision, and  <dig> % f-measure. in the second stage, protein-dna binding mode prediction achieves  <dig> % accuracy while using support vector machine with multi-class prediction.


CONCLUSIONS
this article presents the design of a sequence based predictor aiming to identify sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues in a transcription factor with dna binding-mechanism concerned. the protein-dna binding mode prediction was introduced to help improve dna-binding residues prediction. in addition, the results of this study will help with the design of binding-mechanism concerned predictors for other families of proteins interacting with dna.
