BACKGROUND
umbilical cord blood  is enriched with transplantable cd34+ cells. in addition to cd34-expressing haematopoietic stem cells , human ucb contains a rare population of cd34-lineage- cells endowed with the ability to differentiate along the t/nk pathway in response to interleukin - <dig> and a stromal cell support. il- <dig> is a crucial regulator of nk cell function, whose influence on il-15-induced differentiation of cd34-lineage- cells has not been investigated previously. the present study was designed and conducted to address whether il- <dig> might replace the stromal cell requirements and foster the il-15-induced nk differentiation of human ucb cd34-lineage- cells.


RESULTS
cd34-lineage- cells were maintained in liquid culture with flt3-l and scf, with the addition of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  either alone or in combination. cultures were established in the absence of feeder cells or serum supplementation. cytokine-treated cells were used to evaluate cell surface phenotype, expression of molecular determinants of lymphoid/nk cell differentiation, secretion of ifn-γ, gm-csf, tnf-α and ccl3/mip-1α, and cytolytic activity against nk-sensitive tumour cell targets. cd34-lineage- cells proliferated vigorously in response to il- <dig> and il- <dig> but not to il- <dig> alone, and up-regulated phosphorylated stat <dig> and stat <dig> proteins. cd34-lineage- cells expanded by il- <dig> in combination with il- <dig> acquired lymphoid morphology and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor -cd56+cd16-/+ phenotype, consistent with pseudo-mature nk cells. il-21/il-15-differentiated cells expressed high levels of mrna for bcl- <dig>  gata- <dig> and id <dig>  a master switch required for nk-cell development, and harboured un-rearranged tcrγ genes. from a functional standpoint, il-21/il-15-treated cells secreted copious amounts of ifn-γ, gm-csf and ccl3/mip-1α, and expressed cell surface cd107a upon contact with nk-sensitive tumour targets, a measure of exocytosis of nk secretory granules.


CONCLUSIONS
this study underpins a novel role for il- <dig> in the differentiation of pseudo-mature lytic nk cells in a synergistic context with il- <dig>  and identifies a potential strategy to expand functional nk cells for immunotherapy.
