BACKGROUND
we recently identified a novel oncogene, cancer-upregulated gene  <dig> , which is essential for kinetochore formation and promotes tumorigenesis in mammalian cells. however, the in vivo function of cug <dig> has not been studied in animal models.


RESULTS
to study the function of cug <dig> in vivo, we isolated a zebrafish homologue that is expressed specifically in the proliferating cells of the central nervous system . morpholino-mediated knockdown of cug <dig> resulted in apoptosis throughout the cns and the development of neurodegenerative phenotypes. in addition, cug2-deficient embryos contained mitotically arrested cells displaying abnormal spindle formation and chromosome misalignment in the neural plate.


CONCLUSIONS
therefore, our findings suggest that cug <dig> is required for normal mitosis during early neurogenesis and has functions in neuronal cell maintenance, thus demonstrating that the cug <dig> deficient embryos may provide a model system for human neurodegenerative disorders.
