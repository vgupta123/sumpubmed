BACKGROUND
cats with feline calicivirus -related symptoms are commonly presented to veterinary practitioners. various clinical manifestations have been attributed to fcv, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease , oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. additionally, healthy cats can shed fcv. the aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of fcv in cats with fcv-related symptoms and in healthy cats in switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with urtd-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and fcv infection.


RESULTS
oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in  <dig> veterinary practices from  <dig> fcv-suspect and  <dig> healthy cats originating from  <dig> cantons of switzerland. the samples were tested for fcv using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  and for feline herpesvirus- <dig> , mycoplasma felis, chlamydophila felis, bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qpcr. within the two populations , the observed pcr prevalences were: fcv 45 %/8 %, fhv- <dig> 20 %/9 %, c. felis 8 %/1 %, b. bronchiseptica 4 %/2 %, m. felis 47 %/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %/14 %. based on multivariable regression models amongst fcv-suspect cats , co-infection with m. felis , group housing  and intact reproductive status  were found to be risk factors for fcv infection. in healthy cats, intact reproductive status  and group housing  were found to be associated with fcv infection. based on an univariable approach, fcv-suspect cats were found to be significantly less often fcv-positive when vaccinated . oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of urtd were significantly associated with fcv infection .


CONCLUSIONS
fcv was detected in less than half of the cats that were judged fcv-suspect by veterinary practitioners. for a clinical diagnosis, fcv-related symptoms should be revisited. fcv infection was present in some healthy cats, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in fcv epidemiology. to reduce fcv-related problems in multi-cat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.
