BACKGROUND
hc <dig> mouse mammary epithelial cells differentiate in response to lactogenic hormone resulting in expression of milk proteins including β-casein. previous studies have shown that epidermal growth factor  blocks differentiation not only through activation of the ras/mek/erk pathway but also implicated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase  signaling. the current study analyzes the mechanism of the pi-3-kinase pathway in an egf-induced block of hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation.


RESULTS
hc <dig> and hc11-luci cells, which contain luciferase gene under the control of a β-casein promotor, were treated with specific chemical inhibitors of signal transduction pathways or transiently infected/transfected with vectors encoding dominant negative-akt  or conditionally active-akt . the expression of ca-akt inhibited lactogenic differentiation of hc <dig> cells, and the infection with dn-akt adenovirus enhanced β-casein transcription and rescued β-casein promotor-regulated luciferase activity in the presence of egf. treatment of cells with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mtor, blocked the effects of egf on β-casein promotor driven luciferase activity as effectively as pi-3-kinase inhibitors. while expression of ca-akt caused a constitutive activation of p70s <dig> kinase  in hc <dig> cells, the inhibition of either pi-3-kinase or mtor abolished the activation of p70s6k by egf. the activation of p70s6k by insulin or egf resulted in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s <dig> , elongation initiation factor 4e  and 4e binding protein <dig> . but lower levels of pi-3-k and mtor inhibitors were required to block insulin-induced phosphorylation of rps <dig> than egf-induced phosphorylation, and insulin-induced phosphorylation of elf4e and 4e-bp <dig> was not completely mtor dependent suggesting some diversity of signaling for egf and insulin. in hc <dig> cells undergoing lactogenic differentiation the phosphorylation of p70s6k completely diminished by  <dig> hours, and this was partly attributable to dexamethasone, a component of lactogenic hormone mix. however, p70s6k phosphorylation persisted in the presence of lactogenic hormone and egf, but the activation could be blocked by a pi-3-kinase inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
pi-3-kinase signaling contributes to the egf block of lactogenic differentiation via akt and p70s6k. the egf-induced activation of pi-3-kinase-akt-mtor regulates phosphorylation of molecules including ribosomal protein s <dig>  eif4e and 4e-bp <dig> that influence translational control in hc <dig> cells undergoing lactogenic differentiation.
