BACKGROUND
because the japanese native cattle kuchinoshima-ushi have been isolated in a small island and their lineage has been intensely protected, it has been assumed to date that numerous and valuable genomic variations are conserved in this cattle breed.


RESULTS
in this study, we evaluated genetic features of this breed, including single nucleotide polymorphism  information, by whole-genome sequencing using a genome analyzer ii. a total of  <dig>  gb of sequence was generated, of which 86% of the obtained reads were successfully mapped to the reference sequence  with bwa. on an average, 93% of the genome was covered by the reads and the number of mapped reads corresponded to  <dig> -fold coverage across the covered region. from these data, we identified  <dig>  million snps, of which more than  <dig>  million  were found to be new. out of the snps annotated in the bovine sequence assembly,  <dig>  were found in protein-coding regions containing  <dig>  nonsynonymous snps in  <dig>  genes. furthermore, phylogenetic analysis using sequence data from  <dig> genes  showed that kuchinoshima-ushi is clearly distinct from european domestic breeds of cattle.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide a framework for further genetic studies in the kuchinoshima-ushi population and research on functions of snp-containing genes, which would aid in understanding the molecular basis underlying phenotypic variation of economically important traits in cattle and in improving intrinsic defects in domestic cattle breeds.
