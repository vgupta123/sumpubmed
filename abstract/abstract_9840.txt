BACKGROUND
caspase-independent apoptotic pathways are suggested as a mechanism for the delayed neuronal death following ischemic insult. however, the underlying signalling mechanisms are largely unknown. recent studies imply the involvement of several mitochondrial proteins, including endonuclease g  and bcl-2/adenovirus e1b  <dig> kda-interacting protein , in the pathway of non-neuronal cells.


RESULTS
in this report, using western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, we found that endog upregulates and translocates from mitochondria to nucleus in a time-dependent manner in cultured hippocampal neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation . moreover, the translocation of endog occurs hours before the observable nuclear pyknosis. importantly, the mitochondrial upregulation of bnip <dig> precedes the translocation of endog. forced expression of bnip <dig> increases the nuclear translocation of endog and neuronal death while knockdown of bnip <dig> decreases the ogd-induced nuclear translocation of endog and neuronal death.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that bnip <dig> and endog play important roles in hippocampal neuronal apoptosis following ischemia, and mitochondrial bnip <dig> is a signal protein upstream of endog that can induce neuronal death.
