BACKGROUND
active modules are connected regions in biological network which show significant changes in expression over particular conditions. the identification of such modules is important since it may reveal the regulatory and signaling mechanisms that associate with a given cellular response.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a novel active module identification algorithm based on a memetic algorithm. we propose a novel encoding/decoding scheme to ensure the connectedness of the identified active modules. based on the scheme, we also design and incorporate a local search operator into the memetic algorithm to improve its performance.


CONCLUSIONS
the effectiveness of proposed algorithm is validated on both small and large protein interaction networks.
