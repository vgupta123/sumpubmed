BACKGROUND
like all diderm bacteria studied to date, borrelia burgdorferi possesses a β-barrel assembly machine  complex. the bacterial bam complexes characterized thus far consist of an essential integral outer membrane protein designated bama and one or more accessory proteins. the accessory proteins are typically lipid-modified proteins anchored to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane through their lipid moieties. we previously identified and characterized the b. burgdorferi bama protein in detail and more recently identified two lipoproteins encoded by open reading frames bb <dig> and bb <dig> that associate with the borrelial bama protein. the role of the bam accessory lipoproteins in b. burgdorferi is currently unknown.


RESULTS
structural modeling of b. burgdorferi bb <dig> revealed a distinct β-propeller fold similar to the known structure for the e. coli bam accessory lipoprotein bamb. additionally, the structural model for bb <dig> was highly similar to the known structure of bamd, which is consistent with the prior finding that bb <dig> contains tetratricopeptide repeat regions similar to other bamd orthologs. consistent with bb <dig> and bb <dig> being bam accessory lipoproteins, mutants lacking expression of each protein were found to exhibit altered membrane permeability and enhanced sensitivity to various antimicrobials. additionally, bb <dig> mutants also exhibited significantly impaired in vitro growth. finally, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that bb <dig> and bb <dig> each interact specifically and independently with bama to form the bam complex in b. burgdorferi.


CONCLUSIONS
combined structural studies, functional assays, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that bb <dig> and bb <dig> are the respective bamb and bamd orthologs in b. burgdorferi, and are important in membrane integrity and/or outer membrane protein localization. the borrelial bamb and bamd proteins both interact specifically and independently with bama to form a tripartite bam complex in b. burgdorferi. a working model has been developed to further analyze outer membrane biogenesis and outer membrane protein transport in this pathogenic spirochete.
