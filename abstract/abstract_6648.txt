BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important cause of nosocomial infection and may lead to septicemia and death. we evaluated the immunogenicity of semi-purified exotoxin a from the bacterium in a mouse burn model.

methods
the toxoid was prepared from exotoxin a taken from toxigenic strains of p. aeruginosa .  <dig> mice were immunized with the toxoid, burned with hot metal and infected with  <dig> Ã—  <dig> cfu of toxigenic strains of p. aeruginosa ;  <dig> non-immunized mice were also burned and infected . the mortality rate and presence of any exotoxin and p. aeruginosa in the sera, liver and spleen were determined.


RESULTS
in the experimental group,  <dig> mice died before the burns were administered and were excluded from the study. the remainder  were challenged with a lethal dose of p. aeruginosa and followed for  <dig> days.  <dig> of these mice died. neither p. aeruginosa nor exotoxin a was not detected in the liver, spleen or sera of the surviving mice. the protective efficacy of toxoid vaccination was therefore  <dig> %. in the control group, all mice died from bacteremia and septicemia, most  within  <dig> days, and p. aeruginosa and exotoxin a were isolated from sera, spleen and liver.


CONCLUSIONS
active immunization of mice using a semi-purified exotoxin a derived from p. aeruginosa was  <dig> % effective at protecting mice from subsequent p. aeruginosa infections in a mouse burn model.
