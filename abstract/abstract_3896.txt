BACKGROUND
the analysis of dna methylation is a key component in the development of personalized treatment approaches. a common way to measure dna methylation is the calculation of beta values, which are bounded variables of the form m/ that are generated by illumina’s 450k beadchip array. the statistical analysis of beta values is considered to be challenging, as traditional methods for the analysis of bounded variables, such as m-value regression and beta regression, are based on regularity assumptions that are often too strong to adequately describe the distribution of beta values.


RESULTS
we develop a statistical model for the analysis of beta values that is derived from a bivariate gamma distribution for the signal intensities m and u. by allowing for possible correlations between m and u, the proposed model explicitly takes into account the data-generating process underlying the calculation of beta values. using simulated data and a real sample of dna methylation data from the heinz nixdorf recall cohort study, we demonstrate that the proposed model fits our data significantly better than beta regression and m-value regression.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed model contributes to an improved identification of associations between beta values and covariates such as clinical variables and lifestyle factors in epigenome-wide association studies. it is as easy to apply to a sample of beta values as beta regression and m-value regression.
