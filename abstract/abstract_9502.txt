BACKGROUND
although extensive research has been performed to control differentiation of neural stem cells – still, the response of those cells to diverse cell culture conditions often appears to be random and difficult to predict. to this end, we strived to obtain stabilized protocol of nha cells differentiation – allowing for an increase in percentage yield of neuronal cells.


RESULTS
uncommitted gfap and sox <dig> positive neural progenitors – so-called, normal human astrocytes  were differentiated in different environmental conditions to: only neural cells consisted of neuronal  and glial  population, non-neural cells , or mixture of neural and non-neural cells.

in spite of successfully increasing the percentage yield of glial and neuronal vs. non-neural cells by means of environmental changes, we were not able to increase significantly the percentage of neuronal  over glial cells under several different cell culture testing conditions. supplementing serum-free medium with several growth factors  did not radically change the ratio between neuronal and glial cells – i.e.,  <dig> : <dig> in medium without growth factors and  <dig> : <dig> in medium with gdnf, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that biotechnologists attempting to enrich in vitro neural cell cultures in one type of cells – such as that required for transplantology purposes, should consider the strong limiting influence of intrinsic factors upon extracellular factors commonly tested in cell culture conditions.
