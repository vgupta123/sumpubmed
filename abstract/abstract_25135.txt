BACKGROUND
there is increasing evidence of the importance of copy number variants  in genetic diversity among individuals and populations, as well as in some common genetic diseases. we previously characterized a common 32-kb insertion/deletion variant of the psors <dig> locus at chromosome 1q <dig> that harbours the lce3c and lce3b genes. this variant allele  is common in patients with psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders from certain ethnic groups.


RESULTS
using array-cgh  in samples from the hapmap and human genome diversity panel  collections, we identified  <dig> regions showing population differences in comparison to africans. we provided here a comprehensive population-genetic analysis of one of these regions, which involves the 32-kb deletion of the psors <dig> locus. by a pcr-based genotyping assay we characterised the profiles of the lce3c_lce3b-del and the linkage disequilibrium  pattern between the variant allele and the tag snp rs <dig>  our results show that most populations tend to have a higher frequency of the deleted allele than sub-saharan africans. furthermore, we found strong ld between rs4112788g and lce3c_lce3b-del in most non-african populations , in contrast to the low concordance between loci  in the african populations.


CONCLUSIONS
these results are another example of population variability in terms of biomedical interesting cnv. the frequency distribution of the lce3c_lce3b-del allele and the ld pattern across populations suggest that the differences between ethnic groups might not be due to natural selection, but the consequence of genetic drift caused by the strong bottleneck that occurred during “out of africa” expansion.
