BACKGROUND
ifnγ-producing cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg represent the first line of treg during an immune response. in the present study we determined whether ifnγ+ treg in-vivo and in-vitro are helios-positive representing activated natural  or helios-negative representing adaptive treg  and whether they originate from cd4+cd25+ and/or cd4+cd25- pbl. furtheron, we investigated whether they are inducible by recombinant ifnγ  as a single stimulus, decrease in-vitro after elimination of the stimulus, and have a demethylated foxp <dig> treg-specific demethylated region  which is associated with stable foxp <dig> expression.

method
subsets of ifnγ+ treg were determined in peripheral blood of healthy controls using eight-color flow cytometry and were further investigated in-vitro. foxp <dig> tsdr methylation status was determined using bisulphite polymerase chain reaction  and high resolution melt  analysis.


RESULTS
nearly all treg in the peripheral blood were helios+ifnγ-  and only few were helios+ifnγ+ or helios-ifnγ+ treg . enriched ifnγ+ treg subsets showed in part strong foxp <dig> tsdr demethylation. in-vitro, rifnγ was unable to induce treg. cd4+cd25+ enriched pbl stimulated with pma/ionomycin in the presence of rifnγ were rather resistant to the effect of rifnγ, in contrast to cd4+cd25- enriched pbl which showed increasing total treg with helios+ treg switching from ifnγ- to ifnγ+ and increasing helios-ifnγ+ treg. the data indicate that rifnγ, in combination with a polyclonal stimulus, activates ntreg and induces atreg. when phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate /ionomycin was washed out from the cell culture after 6 h stimulation, treg induction continued for at least 96 h of cell culture, contradicting the hypothesis that removal of the stimulus results in significant decrease of ifnγ- and ifnγ+ cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg due to loss of foxp <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
ifnγ+helios- atreg as well as ifnγ+helios+ ntreg are detectable in the blood of healthy individuals, show in part strong foxp <dig> tsdr demethylation and are inducible in-vitro. the present data provide further insight concerning the in-vivo and in-vitro characteristics of ifnγ+ treg and help to understand their role in immunoregulation. alloantigen-specific demethylated ifnγ+helios+ ntreg might represent a suitable marker for monitoring graft-specific immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
