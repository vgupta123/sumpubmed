BACKGROUND
identifying key components in biological processes and their associations is critical for deciphering cellular functions. recently, numerous gene expression and molecular interaction experiments have been reported in saccharomyces cerevisiae, and these have enabled systematic studies. although a number of approaches have been used to predict gene functions and interactions, tools that analyze the essential coordination of functional components in cellular processes still need to be developed.


RESULTS
in this work, we present a new approach to study the cooperation of functional modules  in a specific cellular process. a cooperative module pair is defined as two modules that significantly cooperate with certain functional genes in a cellular process. this method identifies cooperative module pairs that significantly influence a cellular process and the correlated genes and interactions that are essential to that process. using the yeast cell cycle as an example, we identified  <dig> cooperative module associations among  <dig> modules, and importantly, we established a cell cycle-specific cooperative module network. most of the identified module pairs cover cooperative pathways and components essential to the cell cycle. we found that  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cooperative module pairs significantly cooperate with genes regulated in early g <dig>  late g <dig>  s, g <dig>  and m phase, respectively. fifty-nine module pairs that correlate with cdc <dig> and other essential regulators were also identified. these results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate that our methodology is effective for studying cooperative mechanisms in the cell cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we propose a new approach to identifying condition-related cooperative interactions, and importantly, we establish a cell cycle-specific cooperation module network. these results provide a global view of the cell cycle and the method can be used to discover the dynamic coordination properties of functional components in other cellular processes.
