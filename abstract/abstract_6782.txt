BACKGROUND
continuous diabetes-associated complications are a major source of immune
system exhaustion and an increased incidence of infection. diabetes can
cause poor circulation in the feet, increasing the likelihood of ulcers
forming when the skin is damaged and slowing the healing of the ulcers. whey
proteins  enhance immunity during childhood and have a protective
effect on some immune disorders. therefore, in this study, we investigated
the effects of camel wp on the healing and closure of diabetic wounds in a
streptozotocin -induced type i diabetic mouse model.


RESULTS
diabetic mice exhibited delayed wound closure characterized by a significant
decrease in an anti-inflammatory cytokine  and a prolonged
elevation of the levels of inflammatory cytokines  in wound tissue. moreover, aberrant expression of chemokines that
regulate wound healing  and growth
factors  were observed in the wound tissue of diabetic mice
compared with control nondiabetic mice. interestingly, compared with
untreated diabetic mice, supplementation with wp significantly accelerated
the closure of diabetic wounds by limiting inflammatory stimuli via the
restoration of normal il- <dig>  tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig> levels. most
importantly, the supplementation of diabetic mice with wp significantly
modulated the expression of mip-1α, mip- <dig>  kc, cx3cl <dig> and tgf-β in
wound tissue compared with untreated diabetic mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate the benefits of wp supplementation for improving the
healing and closure of diabetic wounds and restoring the immune response in
diabetic mice.
