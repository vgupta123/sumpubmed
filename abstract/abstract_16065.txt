BACKGROUND
the genome data of streptococcus pyogenes sf <dig> has been widely used by many researchers and provides a vast array of interesting findings. nevertheless, approximately 40% of genes remain classified as hypothetical proteins, and several coding sequences  have been unrecognized. in this study, we attempted a shotgun proteomic analysis with a six-frame database that was independent of genome annotation.


RESULTS
nine proteins encoded by novel orfs were found by shotgun proteomic analysis, and their specific mrnas were verified by reverse transcriptional pcr . we also provided functional annotations for hypothetical genes using proteomic analysis from three different culture conditions that were separated into three fractions: supernatant, soluble, and insoluble. consequently, we identified  <dig> proteins on re-evaluation of the proteomic data using an in-house database comprising  <dig>  annotated and nine non-annotated cdss. we provided functional annotations for  <dig> hypothetical proteins  based on their cellular fractions and expression profiles under different culture conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
the list of amino acid sequences that were annotated by genome analysis contains outdated information and unrecognized protein-coding sequences. we suggest that the six-frame database derived from actual dna sequences be used for reliable proteomic analysis. in addition, the experimental evidence from functional proteomic analysis is useful for the re-evaluation of previously sequenced genomes.
