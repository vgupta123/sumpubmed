BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of short non-coding, endogenous rnas that play key roles in many biological processes in both animals and plants. although many mirnas have been identified in a large number of organisms, the mirnas in foxtail millet  have, until now, been poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this study, two replicate small rna libraries from foxtail millet shoots were sequenced, and  <dig> million reads representing over  <dig> million unique sequences were generated. we identified  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> mirtron precursor candidates in foxtail millet. some mirna*s of the known and novel mirnas were detected as well. further, eight novel mirnas were validated by stem-loop rt-pcr. potential targets of the foxtail millet mirnas were predicted based on our strict criteria. of the predicted target genes, 79%  had functional annotations in interpro and go analyses, indicating the targets of the mirnas were involved in a wide range of regulatory functions and some specific biological processes. a total of  <dig> pairs of syntenic mirna precursors that were conserved between foxtail millet and sorghum were found. additionally, stem-loop rt-pcr was conducted to confirm the tissue-specific expression of some mirnas in the four tissues identified by deep-sequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
we predicted, for the first time,  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mirna targets in foxtail millet at a genome-wide level. the precursors, expression levels, mirna* sequences, target functions, conservation, and evolution of mirnas we identified were investigated. some of the novel foxtail millet mirnas and mirna targets were validated experimentally.
