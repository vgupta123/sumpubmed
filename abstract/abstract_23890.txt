BACKGROUND
heparan sulfate  biosynthesis is tightly regulated during vertebrate embryo development. however, potential roles for hs biosynthesis in regulating the function of paracrine signaling molecules that bind to hs are incompletely understood.


RESULTS
in this report we have studied fgf, wnt and hedgehog  signaling in ext <dig> mutants, where heparan sulfate content is low. we found that fgf targeted gene expression is reduced in ext <dig> mutants and that the remaining expression is readily inhibited by su <dig>  an fgf receptor inhibitor. in the ext <dig> mutants, fgf signaling is shown to be affected during nervous system development and reduction of fgf ligands in the mutants affects tail development. also, wnt signaling is affected in the ext <dig> mutants, as shown by a stronger phenotype in ext <dig> mutants injected with morpholinos that partially block translation of wnt <dig> or wnt5b, compared to injected wild type embryos. in contrast, hh dependent signaling is apparently unaffected in the ext <dig> mutants; hh targeted gene expression is not reduced, the hh inhibitor cyclopamine is not more affective in the mutants and hh dependent cell differentiation in the retina and in the myotome are normal in ext <dig> mutants. in addition, no genetic interaction between ext <dig> and shha during development could be detected.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ext <dig> is involved in fgf and wnt signaling but not in hh signaling, revealing an unexpected specificity for ext <dig> in signaling pathways during embryonic development. thus, our results support the hypothesis that regulation of heparan sulfate biosynthesis has distinct instructive functions for different signaling factors.
