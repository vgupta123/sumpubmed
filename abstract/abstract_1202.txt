BACKGROUND
a number of expression systems have been developed where transgene expression can be regulated. they all have specific characteristics making them more suitable for certain applications than for others. since some applications require the regulation of several genes, there is a need for a variety of independent yet compatible systems.


RESULTS
we have used the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial operons  to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells using three different strategies. in the repressor configuration, regulation is mediated by the binding of the repressor  to the operator site , placed downstream of a strong constitutive promoter. addition of cumate, a small molecule, relieves the repression. in the transactivator configuration, a chimaeric transactivator  protein, formed by the fusion of cymr with the activation domain of vp <dig>  is able to activate transcription when bound to multiple copies of cuo, placed upstream of the cmv minimal promoter. cumate addition abrogates dna binding and therefore transactivation by cta. finally, an adenoviral library of cta mutants was screened to identify a reverse cumate activator , which activates transcription in the presence rather than the absence of cumate.


CONCLUSIONS
we report the generation of a new versatile inducible expression system.
