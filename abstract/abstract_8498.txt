BACKGROUND
since the first genome of a halophilic archaeon was sequenced in  <dig>  biologists have been advancing the understanding of genomic characteristics that allow for survival in the harsh natural environments of these organisms. an increase in protein acidity and gc-bias in the genome have been implicated as factors in tolerance to extreme salinity, desiccation, and high solar radiation. however, few previous attempts have been made to identify novel genes that would permit survival in such extreme conditions.


RESULTS
with the recent release of several new complete haloarchaeal genome sequences, we have conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis focusing on the identification of unique haloarchaeal conserved proteins that likely play key roles in environmental adaptation. using bioinformatic methods, we have clustered  <dig>  predicted proteins from nine haloarchaeal genomes into  <dig>  haloarchaeal orthologous groups . we assigned likely functions by association with established cog and kog databases in ncbi. after identifying homologs in four additional haloarchaeal genomes, we determined that there were  <dig> core haloarchaeal protein clusters , of which  <dig> clusters were found primarily in haloarchaea. further analysis found that  <dig> clusters were truly unique  to haloarchaea and qualify as signature proteins while  <dig> were nearly unique , the vast majority of which were coded for on the haloarchaeal chromosomes. of the signature proteins, only one example with any predicted function, ral, involved in desiccation/radiation tolerance in halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  was identified. among the core clusters, 33% was predicted to function in metabolism, 25% in information transfer and storage, 10% in cell processes and signaling, and 22% belong to poorly characterized or general function groups.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies have established conserved groups of nearly  <dig> protein clusters present in all haloarchaea, with a subset of  <dig> which are predicted to be accessory proteins that may be critical or essential for success in an extreme environment. these studies support core and signature genes and proteins as valuable concepts for understanding phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics of coherent groups of organisms.
