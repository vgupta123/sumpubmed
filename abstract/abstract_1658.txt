BACKGROUND
there is increasing evidence on complex interaction between the nervous and immune systems in patients with cerebral infarction. this study was conducted to evaluate cytotoxic function of cd8+ t lymphocytes isolated from patients with acute severe cerebral infarction. in order to determine role of immune system in stroke, peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were taken and cytotoxic function of cd8+ t lymphocytes were induced by virus peptides and cells were analyzed on a four-color flow cytometer. expression of cd107a, intracellular expression of interferon-γ  and tumor necrosis factor-α , and cell proliferation assay were analyzed by using carboxyl fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> patients with cerebral infarction and  <dig> healthy volunteers with an average age  <dig>  years, were evaluated. the pbmcs were separated from blood samples of both, patients with cerebral infarction 6 hours after onset of stroke and healthy volunteers. after stimulation with virus peptides, cd107a expression and intracellular production of ifn-γ and tnf-α was decreased in patients with cerebral infarction as compared to healthy volunteers . degranulation analysis reported decreased expression of cd107a + in patient group as compared to healthy group, p < <dig> . a mild decrease in intracellular expression of ifn-γ and tnf-α was also shown in patients without stimulation of virus peptides . however, proliferation of cd8+ t lymphocytes in patients with acute severe cerebral infarction was not decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
the study results indicated that cytotoxic function of cd8+ t lymphocytes were suppressed in patients with acute severe cerebral infarction. this could possibly be associated with complicated infectious diseases and neuroprotective mechanism.
