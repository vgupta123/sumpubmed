BACKGROUND
studies reported unintended pleiotropic effects for a number of pesticidal proteins ectopically expressed in transgenic crops, but the nature and significance of such effects in planta remain poorly understood. here we assessed the effects of corn cystatin ii , a potent inhibitor of c1a cysteine  proteases considered for insect and pathogen control, on the leaf proteome and pathogen resistance status of potato lines constitutively expressing this protein.


RESULTS
the leaf proteome of lines accumulating ccii at different levels was resolved by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and compared with the leaf proteome of a control  line. out of ca.  <dig> proteins monitored on 2-d gels,  <dig> were significantly up- or downregulated in ccii-expressing leaves, including  <dig> proteins detected de novo or up-regulated by more than five-fold compared to the control. most up-regulated proteins were abiotic or biotic stress-responsive proteins, including different secretory peroxidases, wound inducible protease inhibitors and pathogenesis-related proteins. accordingly, infection of leaf tissues by the fungal necrotroph botryris cinerea was prevented in ccii-expressing plants, despite a null impact of ccii on growth of this pathogen and the absence of extracellular cys protease targets for the inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
these data point to the onset of pleiotropic effects altering the leaf proteome in transgenic plants expressing recombinant protease inhibitors. they also show the potential of these proteins as ectopic modulators of stress responses in planta, useful to engineer biotic or abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants of economic significance.
