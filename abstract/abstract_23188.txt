BACKGROUND
in equine practice, teeth corrections by means of motorized grinding systems are standard procedure. the heat resulting from that treatment may cause irreparable damage to the dental pulp. it has been shown that a  <dig> °c temperature rise may cause severe destruction in pulp cells. hence, the capability to continuously form secondary dentine is lost, and may lead, due to equine-typical occlusal tooth abrasion, to an opening of the pulp cavity.

to obtain reliable data on the intra-pulp increase in temperature during corrective treatments, equine cheek teeth  were modified in a way  that had been qualified in own former published studies. all parameters influencing the grinding process were standardized . during grinding experiments, imitating real dental treatments, the time span for an intra-pulp temperature increase of  <dig> °c was determined.


RESULTS
the minimum time recorded for an intra-pulp temperature increase of  <dig> °c was 38 s in mandibular ct  and 70 s in maxillary ct . the data obtained showed that doubling the rotational speed of the disk results in halving the time span after which the critical intra-pulp temperature increase in maxillary ct is reached. for mandibular ct, the time span even drops by two thirds.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of standardized hypsodont ct enabled comparative studies of intra-pulp heating during the grinding of occlusal tooth surfaces using different tools and techniques. the anatomical structure of the natural vital hypsodont tooth must be kept in mind, so that the findings of this study do not create a deceptive sense of security with regard to the time-dependent heating of the native pulp.
