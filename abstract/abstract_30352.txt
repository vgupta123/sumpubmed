BACKGROUND
non-small cell lung cancer  accounts for 81% of all cases of lung cancer and they are often fatal because 60% of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. besides the need for earlier diagnosis, there is a high need for additional effective therapies. in this work, we investigated the feasibility of a lung cancer progression mouse model, mimicking features of human aggressive nsclc, as biological reservoir for potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.


RESULTS
we performed rna-seq profiling on total rna extracted from lungs of a  <dig> week-old k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg and wild type  mice to detect fusion genes and gene/exon-level differential expression associated to the increase of tumor mass. fusion events were not detected in k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg tumors. differential expression at exon-level detected  <dig> genes with differential exon usage. among them nine, i.e. those secreted or expressed on the plasma membrane, were used for a meta-analysis of more than  <dig> nsclc rna-seq transcriptomes. none of the genes showed a significant correlation between exon-level expression and disease prognosis. differential expression at gene-level allowed the identification of  <dig> genes with a significant increase in expression associated to tumor mass increase.  <dig> genes, i.e. those secreted or expressed on the plasma membrane, were used for a meta-analysis of two transcriptomics datasets of human nsclc samples, encompassing more than  <dig> samples. spp <dig> was the only molecule whose over-expression resulted statistically related to poor outcome regarding both survival and metastasis formation. two other molecules showed over-expression associated to poor outcome due to metastasis formation: gm-csf and adora <dig>  gm-csf is a secreted protein, and we confirmed its expression in the supernatant of a cell line derived by a k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mouse tumor. adora <dig> is instead involved in the induction of p53-mediated apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. since in our model p <dig> is inactivated, adora <dig> does not negatively affect tumor growth but remains expressed on tumor cells. thus, it could represent an interesting target for the development of antibody-targeted therapy on a subset of nsclc, which are p <dig> null and adora <dig> positive.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provided a complete transcription overview of the k-rasla1/p53r172hΔg mouse nsclc model. this approach allowed the detection of adora <dig> as a potential target for antibody-based therapy in p <dig> mutated tumors.
