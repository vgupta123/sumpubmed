BACKGROUND
este <dig> is a hyperthermophilic esterase belonging to the hormone-sensitive lipase family and was originally isolated by functional screening of a metagenomic library constructed from a thermal environmental sample. dimers and oligomers may have been evolutionally selected in thermophiles because intersubunit interactions can confer thermostability on the proteins. the molecular mechanisms of thermostabilization of this extremely thermostable esterase are not well understood due to the lack of structural information.


RESULTS
here we report for the first time the  <dig> -Å resolution crystal structure of este <dig>  the three-dimensional structure of este <dig> exhibits a classic α/β hydrolase fold with a central parallel-stranded beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices on both sides. the residues ser <dig>  asp <dig>  and his <dig> form the catalytic triad motif commonly found in other α/β hydrolases. este <dig> exists as a dimer that is formed by hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges. circular dichroism spectroscopy and heat inactivation kinetic analysis of este <dig> mutants, which were generated by structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues participating in este <dig> dimerization, revealed that hydrophobic interactions through val <dig> and phe <dig> on the β <dig> strand of each monomer play a major role in the dimerization of este <dig>  in contrast, the intermolecular salt bridges contribute less significantly to the dimerization and thermostability of este <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that intermolecular hydrophobic interactions are essential for the hyperthermostability of este <dig>  the molecular mechanism that allows este <dig> to endure high temperature will provide guideline for rational design of a thermostable esterase/lipase using the lipolytic enzymes showing structural similarity to este <dig>
