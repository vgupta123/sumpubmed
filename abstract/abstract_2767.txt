BACKGROUND
the reiterated architecture of cranial motor neurons aligns with the segmented structure of the embryonic vertebrate hindbrain. anterior-posterior identity of cranial motor neurons depends, in part, on retinoic acid signaling levels. the early vertebrate embryo maintains a balance between retinoic acid synthetic and degradative zones on the basis of reciprocal expression domains of the retinoic acid synthesis gene aldhehyde dehydrogenase 1a <dig>  posteriorly and the oxidative gene cytochrome p <dig> type 26a <dig>  in the forebrain, midbrain, and anterior hindbrain.


RESULTS
this manuscript investigates the role of zinc finger of the cerebellum  transcription factors in regulating levels of retinoic acid and differentiation of cranial motor neurons. depletion of zebrafish zic2a and zic2b results in a strong downregulation of aldh1a <dig> expression and a concomitant reduction in activity of a retinoid-dependent transgene. the vagal motor neuron phenotype caused by loss of zic2a/2b mimics a depletion of aldh1a <dig> and is rescued by exogenously supplied retinoic acid.


CONCLUSIONS
zic transcription factors function in patterning hindbrain motor neurons through their regulation of embryonic retinoic acid signaling.
