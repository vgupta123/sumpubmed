BACKGROUND
eps <dig> homology  domains are protein interaction modules binding to peptides containing asn-pro-phe  motifs and mediating critical events during endocytosis and signal transduction. the eh domain of pob <dig> associates with eps <dig>  a protein characterized by a striking string of dpf triplets,  <dig> in human and  <dig> in mouse eps <dig>  at the c-terminus and lacking the typical eh-binding npf motif.


RESULTS
by screening a multivalent nonapeptide phage display library we have demonstrated that the eh domain of pob <dig> has a different recognition specificity since it binds to both npf and dpf motifs. the region of mouse eps <dig> responsible for the interaction with the eh domain of pob <dig> maps within a  <dig> amino acid peptide  that includes three dpf repeats. finally, mutational analysis in the eh domain of pob <dig>  revealed that several solvent exposed residues, while distal to the binding pocket, mediate specific recognition of binding partners through both hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we have analysed the binding specificity of the pob <dig> eh domain. we show that it differs from other eh domains since it interacts with both npf- and dpf-containing sequences. these unusual binding properties could be attributed to a different conformation of the binding pocket that allows to accommodate negative charges; moreover, we identified a cluster of solvent exposed lys residues, which are only found in the eh domain of pob <dig>  and influence binding to both npf and dpf motifs. the characterization of structures of the dpf ligands described in this study and the pob <dig> eh domain will clearly determine the involvement of the positive patch and the rationalization of our findings.
