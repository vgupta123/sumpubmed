BACKGROUND
analyzing the integration profile of retroviral vectors is a vital step in determining their potential genotoxic effects and developing safer vectors for therapeutic use. identifying retroviral vector integration sites is also important for retroviral mutagenesis screens.


RESULTS
we developed visa, a vector integration site analysis server, to analyze next-generation sequencing data for retroviral vector integration sites. sequence reads that contain a provirus are mapped to the human genome, sequence reads that cannot be localized to a unique location in the genome are filtered out, and then unique retroviral vector integration sites are determined based on the alignment scores of the remaining sequence reads.


CONCLUSIONS
visa offers a simple web interface to upload sequence files and results are returned in a concise tabular format to allow rapid analysis of retroviral vector integration sites.
