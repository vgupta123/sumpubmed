BACKGROUND
rhythmic clock widely occurs in biological systems which controls several aspects of cell physiology. for the different cell types, it is supplied with various rhythmic frequencies. how to synthesize a specific clock signal is a preliminary but a necessary step to further development of a biological computer in the future.


RESULTS
this paper presents a genetic sequential logic circuit with a clock pulse generator based on a synthesized genetic oscillator, which generates a consecutive clock signal whose frequency is an inverse integer multiple to that of the genetic oscillator. an analogous electronic waveform-shaping circuit is constructed by a series of genetic buffers to shape logic high/low levels of an oscillation input in a basic sinusoidal cycle and generate a pulse-width-modulated  output with various duty cycles. by controlling the threshold level of the genetic buffer, a genetic clock pulse signal with its frequency consistent to the genetic oscillator is synthesized. a synchronous genetic counter circuit based on the topology of the digital sequential logic circuit is triggered by the clock pulse to synthesize the clock signal with an inverse multiple frequency to the genetic oscillator. the function acts like a frequency divider in electronic circuits which plays a key role in the sequential logic circuit with specific operational frequency.


CONCLUSIONS
a cascaded genetic logic circuit generating clock pulse signals is proposed. based on analogous implement of digital sequential logic circuits, genetic sequential logic circuits can be constructed by the proposed approach to generate various clock signals from an oscillation signal.
