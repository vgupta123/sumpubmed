BACKGROUND
developmental iodine deficiency results in inadequate thyroid hormone , which damages the hippocampus. here, we explored the roles of hippocampal doublecortin and neural cell adhesion molecule - <dig> in developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism.

methods
two developmental rat models were established with either an iodine-deficient diet, or propylthiouracil -adulterated water  to impair thyroid function, in pregnant rats from gestational day  <dig> until postnatal day   <dig>  silver-stained neurons and protein levels of doublecortin and ncam- <dig> in several hippocampal subregions were assessed on pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  and pn <dig> 


RESULTS
the results show that nerve fibers in iodine-deficient and  <dig> ppm ptu-treated rats were injured on pn <dig> and pn <dig>  downregulation of doublecortin and upregulation of ncam- <dig> were observed in iodine-deficient and  <dig> ppm ptu-treated rats from pn <dig> on. these alterations were irreversible by the restoration of serum th concentrations on pn <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism impair the expression of doublecortin and ncam- <dig>  leading to nerve fiber malfunction and thus impairments in hippocampal development.
