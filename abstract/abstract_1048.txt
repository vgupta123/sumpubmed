BACKGROUND
sugarcane genetic mapping has lagged behind other crops due to its complex autopolyploid genome structure. modern sugarcane cultivars have from 110- <dig> chromosomes and are in general interspecific hybrids between two species with different basic chromosome numbers: saccharum officinarum  with a basic chromosome number of  <dig> and s. spontaneum  with a basic chromosome number of  <dig>  the first maps that were constructed utilised the single dose  markers generated using rflp, more recent maps generated using aflp and ssrs provided at most 60% genome coverage. diversity array technology  markers are high throughput allowing greater numbers of markers to be generated.


RESULTS
progeny from a cross between a sugarcane variety q <dig> and a s. officinarum accession ij76- <dig> were used to generate  <dig> sd markers. a genetic map of q <dig> was generated containing  <dig> markers, these markers formed  <dig> linkage groups  of which  <dig> could be placed using allelic information into the eight basic homology groups  of sugarcane. the hgs contained from  <dig> to  <dig> lgs and from  <dig> to  <dig> markers with a total map length of  <dig>  cm and an average density of one marker every  <dig>  cm. each homology group contained on average  <dig> markers of which 43% were dart markers 31% aflp, 16% ssrs and 6% snp markers. the multi-allelic ssr and snp markers were used to place the lgs into hgs.


CONCLUSIONS
the dart array has allowed us to generate and map a larger number of markers than ever before and consequently to map a larger portion of the sugarcane genome. this larger number of markers has enabled 92% of the lgs to be placed into the  <dig> hgs that represent the basic chromosome number of the ancestral species, s. spontaneum. there were two hgs  that contained larger numbers of lgs verifying the alignment of two sets of s. officinarum chromosomes with one set of s. spontaneum chromosomes and explaining the difference in basic chromosome number between the two ancestral species. there was also evidence of more complex structural differences between the two ancestral species.
