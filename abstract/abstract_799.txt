BACKGROUND
previously published reports indicated that some enzymes of the central carbon metabolism , particularly those involved in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, may contribute to regulation of dna replication. however, vast majority of such works was performed with the use of cancer cells, in the light of carcinogenesis. on the other hand, recent experiments conducted on bacterial models provided evidence for the direct genetic link between ccm and dna replication. therefore, we asked if silencing of genes coding for glycolytic and/or krebs cycle enzymes may affect the control of dna replication in normal human fibroblasts.


RESULTS
particular genes coding for these enzymes were partially silenced with specific sirnas. such cells remained viable. we found that silencing of certain genes resulted in either less efficient or delayed enterance to the s phase. this concerned following genes: hk <dig>  pfkm, tpi, gapdh, eno <dig>  ldha, cs <dig>  aco <dig>  suclg <dig>  sdha, fh and mdh <dig>  decreased levels of expression of hk <dig>  gadph, cs <dig>  aco <dig>  fh and mdh <dig> caused also a substantial impairment in dna synthesis efficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented results illustrate the complexity of the influence of genes coding for enzymes of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle on the control of dna replication in human fibroblasts, and indicate which of them are especially important in this process.
