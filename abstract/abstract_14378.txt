BACKGROUND
a series of 1h-imidazo- quinolin-4-amine derivatives, represented by luf <dig> -2-cyclohexyl-1h-imidazo quinolin-4-amine), are allosteric modulators of the human a <dig> adenosine receptor . here we studied the modulation by luf <dig> of the maximum effect  of structurally diverse agonists at the a <dig> ar stably expressed in cho cells.


RESULTS
in an assay of gtpγs binding, the emax of the a <dig> ar agonist cl-ib-meca at the a <dig> ar was lower than that of the non-selective ar agonist neca. luf <dig> exerted an emax-enhancing effect at a concentration of  <dig>  μm or higher, and was shown to increase the emax of cl-ib-meca and other low-efficacy agonists to a larger extent than that of the high-efficacy agonist neca. interestingly, luf <dig> converted a nucleoside a <dig> ar antagonist mrs <dig>  but not a non-nucleoside antagonist mrs <dig>  into an agonist. luf <dig> alone did not show any effect. mathematical modeling was performed to explain the differential effects of luf <dig> on agonists with various emax. a simple explanation for the observation that luf <dig> has a much stronger effect on cl-ib-meca than on neca derived from the mathematical modeling is that neca has relatively strong intrinsic efficacy, such that the response is already close to the maximum response. therefore, luf <dig> cannot enhance emax much further.


CONCLUSIONS
luf <dig> was found to be an allosteric enhancer of emax of structurally diverse agonists at the a <dig> ar, being more effective for low-emax agonists than for high-emax agonists. luf <dig> was demonstrated to convert an antagonist into an agonist, which represents the first example in g protein-coupled receptors. the observations from the present study are consistent with that predicted by mathematical modeling.
