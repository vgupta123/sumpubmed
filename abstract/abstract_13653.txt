BACKGROUND
arsenic is a carcinogen that is known to induce cell transformation and tumor formation. although studies have been performed to examine the modulation of signaling molecules caused by arsenic exposure, the molecular mechanisms by which arsenic causes cancer are still unclear. we hypothesized that arsenic alters gene expression leading to carcinogenesis in the lung.


RESULTS
in this study, we examined global gene expression in response to  <dig>  μm arsenic treatment for 1– <dig> days in a rat lung epithelial cell line  using an in-house  <dig> k rat dna microarray. one hundred thirty one genes were identified using the one-class statistical analysis of microarray  test. of them,  <dig> genes had a fold change of ≥  <dig> between at least two time points. these genes were then clustered into  <dig> groups using k-means cluster analysis based on their expression patterns. seven selected genes, all associated with cancer, were confirmed by real-time pcr. these genes have functions directly or indirectly related to metabolism, glycolysis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and regulation of transcription.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide important insight for the future studies of arsenic-mediated lung cancer.
