BACKGROUND
mitochondria are semi-autonomous, semi-self-replicating organelles harboring their own dna , and their dysregulation is involved in the development of various diseases. while mtdna does not generally undergo epigenetic modifications, almost all mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear dna. however, the epigenetic regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes  has not been comprehensively analyzed.


RESULTS
we analyzed the dna methylation status of  <dig> nuclear mt genes in the liver, brain, and heart tissues of mouse, and identified  <dig> nuclear mt genes carrying tissue-dependent and differentially methylated regions . these nuclar mt genes are involved in various mitochondrial functions and they also include genes related to human diseases. t-dmrs regulate the expression of nuclear mt genes. nuclear mt genes with tissue-specific hypomethylated t-dmrs were characterized by enrichment of the target genes of specific transcription factors such as foxa <dig> in the liver, and cebpa and stat <dig> in the brain.


CONCLUSIONS
a substantial proportion of nuclear mt genes contained t-dmrs, and the dna methylation status of numerous t-dmrs should underlie tissue-dependent mitochondrial functions.
