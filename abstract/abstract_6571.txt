BACKGROUND
due to their high level of genotypic and phenotypic variability, mus spretus strains were introduced in laboratories to investigate the genetic determinism of complex phenotypes including quantitative trait loci. mus spretus diverged from mus musculus around  <dig>  million years ago and exhibits on average a single nucleotide polymorphism  in every  <dig> base pairs when compared with any of the classical laboratory strains. a genoproteomic approach was used to assess polymorphism of the major milk proteins between seg/pas and c57bl/6j, two inbred strains of mice representative of mus spretus and mus musculus species, respectively.


RESULTS
the milk protein concentration was dramatically reduced in the seg/pas strain by comparison with the c57bl/6j strain . nine major proteins were identified in both milks using rp-hplc, bi-dimensional electrophoresis and maldi-tof mass spectrometry. two caseins  and the whey acidic protein , showed distinct chromatographic and electrophoresis behaviours. these differences were partly explained by the occurrence of amino acid substitutions and splicing variants revealed by cdna sequencing. a total of  <dig> snps were identified in the coding and 3'untranslated regions of the seg/pas csn1s <dig> , csn <dig>  and wap  genes. in addition, a  <dig> nucleotide deletion leading to the loss of a serine residue at position  <dig> was found in the seg/pas wap gene.


CONCLUSIONS
snp frequencies found in three milk protein-encoding genes between mus spretus and mus musculus is twice the values previously reported at the whole genome level. however, the protein structure and post-translational modifications seem not to be affected by snps characterized in our study. splicing mechanisms , already identified in casein genes from other species, likely explain the existence of multiple Î±s1-casein isoforms both in seg/pas and c57bl/6j strains. finally, we propose a possible mechanism by which the hallmark tandem duplication of a 18-nt exon  may have occurred in the mouse genome.
