BACKGROUND
trihelix transcription factor family is plant-specific and plays important roles in developmental processes. however, their function in abiotic stress response is largely unclear.


RESULTS
we studied one member gt- <dig> from arabidopsis in relation to salt stress response. gt- <dig> expression is induced by salt stress and gt- <dig> protein is localized in nucleus and cytoplasm. gt- <dig> acts as a transcriptional activator and its c-terminal end is the activation domain. the protein can bind to the cis-elements gt- <dig> box, gt-3b box and mre <dig>  gt- <dig> confers enhanced salt tolerance in arabidopsis likely through direct binding to the promoter and activation of cor15a, in addition to possible regulation of other relevant genes. the gt- <dig> mutant shows salt sensitivity. tem <dig>  a member of ap2/erf family was identified to interact with gt- <dig> in yeast two-hybrid, bifc and co-ip assays. loss-of-function of tem <dig> exerts no significant difference on salt tolerance or cor15a expression in arabidopsis. however, double mutant gt-4/tem <dig> shows greater sensitivity to salt stress and lower transcript level of cor15a than gt- <dig> single mutant. gt- <dig> plus tem <dig> can synergistically increase the promoter activity of cor15a.


CONCLUSIONS
gt- <dig> interacts with tem <dig> and then co-regulates the salt responsive gene cor15a to improve salt stress tolerance.
