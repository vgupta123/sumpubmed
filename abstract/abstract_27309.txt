BACKGROUND
the family euscorpiidae, which covers europe, asia, africa, and america, is one of the most widely distributed scorpion groups. however, no studies have been conducted on the venom of a euscorpiidae species yet. in this work, we performed a transcriptomic approach for characterizing the venom components from a euscorpiidae scorpion, scorpiops jendeki.


RESULTS
there are ten known types of venom peptides and proteins obtained from scorpiops jendeki. great diversity is observed in primary sequences of most highly expressed types. the most highly expressed types are cytolytic peptides and serine proteases. neurotoxins specific for sodium channels, which are major groups of venom components from buthidae scorpions, are not detected in this study. in addition to those known types of venom peptides and proteins, we also obtain nine atypical types of venom molecules which haven't been observed in any other scorpion species studied to date.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first set of cdnas from scorpiops jendeki, and one of the few transcriptomic analyses from a scorpion. this allows the characterization of a large number of venom molecules, belonging to either known or atypical types of scorpion venom peptides and proteins. besides, our work could provide some clues to the evolution of the scorpion venom arsenal by comparison with venom data from other scorpion lineages.
