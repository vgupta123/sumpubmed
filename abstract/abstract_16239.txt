BACKGROUND
most microarray studies are made using labelling with one or two dyes which allows the hybridization of one or two samples on the same slide. in such experiments, the most frequently used dyes are cy <dig> and cy <dig>  recent improvements in the technology  allow hybridization up to four samples simultaneously. the two additional dyes are alexa <dig> and alexa <dig>  the triple-target or four-target technology is very promising, since it allows more flexibility in the design of experiments, an increase in the statistical power when comparing gene expressions induced by different conditions and a scaled down number of slides. however, there have been few methods proposed for statistical analysis of such data. moreover the lowess correction of the global dye effect is available for only two-color experiments, and even if its application can be derived, it does not allow simultaneous correction of the raw data.


RESULTS
we propose a two-step normalization procedure for triple-target experiments. first the dye bleeding is evaluated and corrected if necessary. then the signal in each channel is normalized using a generalized lowess procedure to correct a global dye bias. the normalization procedure is validated using triple-self experiments and by comparing the results of triple-target and two-color experiments. although the focus is on triple-target microarrays, the proposed method can be used to normalize p differently labelled targets co-hybridized on a same array, for any value of p greater than  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed normalization procedure is effective: the technical biases are reduced, the number of false positives is under control in the analysis of differentially expressed genes, and the triple-target experiments are more powerful than the corresponding two-color experiments. there is room for improving the microarray experiments by simultaneously hybridizing more than two samples.
