BACKGROUND
tale-class homeodomain transcription factors meis and pbx play important roles in formation of the embryonic brain, eye, heart, cartilage or hematopoiesis. loss-of-function studies of pbx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and meis <dig> documented specific functions in embryogenesis, however, functional studies of meis <dig> in mouse are still missing. we have generated a conditional allele of meis <dig> in mice and shown that systemic inactivation of the meis <dig> gene results in lethality by the embryonic day  <dig> that is accompanied with hemorrhaging.


RESULTS
we show that neural crest cells express meis <dig> and meis2-defficient embryos display defects in tissues that are derived from the neural crest, such as an abnormal heart outflow tract with the persistent truncus arteriosus and abnormal cranial nerves. the importance of meis <dig> for neural crest cells is further confirmed by means of conditional inactivation of meis <dig> using crest-specific ap2α-ires-cre mouse. conditional mutants display perturbed development of the craniofacial skeleton with severe anomalies in cranial bones and cartilages, heart and cranial nerve abnormalities.


CONCLUSIONS
meis2-null mice are embryonic lethal. our results reveal a critical role of meis <dig> during cranial and cardiac neural crest cells development in mouse.
