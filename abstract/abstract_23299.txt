BACKGROUND
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae causes respiratory disease in swine and contributes to the porcine respiratory disease complex, a major disease problem in the swine industry. the m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> genome is one of the smallest and best annotated microbial genomes, containing only  <dig> annotated genes and  <dig> known proteins. standard protein databases for mass spectrometry only allow for the identification of known and predicted proteins, which if incorrect can limit our understanding of the biological processes at work. proteogenomic mapping is a methodology which allows the entire 6-frame genome translation of an organism to be used as a mass spectrometry database to help identify unknown proteins as well as correct and confirm existing annotations. this methodology will be employed to perform an in-depth analysis of the m. hyopneumoniae proteome.


RESULTS
proteomic analysis indicates  <dig> of  <dig>  known m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> proteins are expressed under the culture conditions given in this study. furthermore,  <dig> of  <dig>  hypothetical proteins have been confirmed. proteogenomic mapping resulted in the identification of previously unannotated genes gatc and rpmf and 5-prime extensions to genes mhp <dig>  mhp <dig>  and mhp <dig>  all conserved and annotated in other m. hyopneumoniae strains and mycoplasma species. gene prediction with prodigal, a prokaryotic gene predicting program, completely supports the new genomic coordinates calculated using proteogenomic mapping.


CONCLUSIONS
proteogenomic mapping showed that the protein coding genes of the m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> identified in this study are well annotated. only  <dig> % of mapped peptides did not correspond to genes defined by the current genome annotation. this study also illustrates how proteogenomic mapping can be an important tool to help confirm, correct and append known gene models when using a genome sequence as search space for peptide mass spectra. using a gene prediction program which scans for a wide variety of promoters can help ensure genes are accurately predicted or not missed completely. furthermore, protein extraction using differential detergent fractionation effectively increases the number of membrane and cytoplasmic proteins identifiable my mass spectrometry.
