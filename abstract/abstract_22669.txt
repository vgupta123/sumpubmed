BACKGROUND
several major crop species are current or ancient polyploids. to better describe the genetic factors controlling traits of agronomic interest , it is necessary to understand the structural and functional organisation of these qtl regions in relation to genome duplication. we investigated quantitative resistance to the fungal disease stem canker in brassica napus, a highly duplicated amphidiploid species, to assess the proportion of resistance qtl located at duplicated positions.


RESULTS
genome-wide association analysis on a panel of  <dig> oilseed rape varieties genotyped with  <dig> snp indicated that  <dig> markers, corresponding to  <dig> genomic regions, are associated with resistance to stem canker. these genomic regions are relatively equally distributed on the a  and c  genomes of b. napus. overall, 44% of these regions  are duplicated homoeologous regions. they are located in duplications of six  of the  <dig> ancestral blocks that constitute the b. napus genome. overall, these six ancestral blocks have  <dig> duplicated copies in the b.napus genome. almost all of the duplicated copies  harboured resistance associated markers for stem canker resistance, which suggests structural and functional conservation of genetic factors involved in this trait in b. napus.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides information on the involvement of duplicated loci in the control of stem canker resistance in b. napus. further investigation of the similarity/divergence in sequence and gene content of these duplicated regions will provide insight into the conservation and allelic diversity of the underlying genes.
