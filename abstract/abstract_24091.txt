BACKGROUND
various species of genus trigonella are important from medical and culinary aspect. among these, trigonella foenum-graecum is commonly grown as a vegetable. this anti-diabetic herb can lower blood glucose and cholesterol levels. another species, trigonella caerulea is used as food in the form of young seedlings. this herb is also used in cheese making. however, little is known about the genetic variation present in these species. in this report we describe the use of issr and rapd markers to study genetic diversity in both, trigonella foenum-graecum and trigonella caerulea.


RESULTS
seventeen accessions of trigonella foenum-graecum and nine accessions of trigonella caerulea representing various countries were analyzed using issr and rapd markers. genetic diversity parameters  were calculated for issr, rapd and issr+rapd approaches in both the species. dendrograms were constructed using upgma algorithm based on the similarity index values for both trigonella foenum-graecum and trigonella caerulea. the upgma analysis showed that plants from different geographical regions were distributed in different groups in both the species. in trigonella foenum-graecum accessions from pakistan and afghanistan were grouped together in one cluster but accessions from india and nepal were grouped together in another cluster. however, in both the species accessions from turkey did not group together and fell in different clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
based on genetic similarity indices, higher diversity was observed in trigonella caerulea as compared to trigonella foenum-graecum. the genetic similarity matrices generated by issr and rapd markers in both species were highly correlated  indicating congruence between these two systems. implications of these observations in the analysis of genetic diversity and in supporting the possible center of origin and/or diversity for trigonella are discussed.
