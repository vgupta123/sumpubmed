BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is the leading cause of iatrogenic infections in critically ill patients, especially those undergoing mechanical ventilation. in this study, we investigated the effects of the universal signaling molecule autoinducer- <dig>  in biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> 


RESULTS
the addition of  <dig>  nm,  <dig> nm, and  <dig> nm exogenous ai- <dig> to p. aeruginosa pao <dig> increased biofilm formation, bacterial viability, and the production of virulence factors. however, compared to the  <dig> nm ai- <dig> group, higher concentrations of ai- <dig>  reduced biofilm formation, bacterial viability, and the production of virulence factors. consistent with the changes in morphology, gene expression analysis revealed that ai- <dig> up-regulated the expression of quorum sensing-associated genes and genes encoding virulence factors at lower concentrations and down-regulated these genes at higher concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that exogenous ai- <dig> acted in a dose-dependent manner to regulate p. aeruginosa biofilm formation and virulence factors secretion via modulating the expression of quorum sensing-associated genes and may be targeted to treat p. aeruginosa biofilm infections.
