BACKGROUND
a key to understanding the evolution of the nervous system on a large phylogenetic scale is the identification of homologous neuronal types. here, we focus this search on the sensory and motor neurons of bilaterians, exploiting their well-defined molecular signatures in vertebrates. sensorimotor circuits in vertebrates are of two types: somatic  and visceral . these circuits differ by a small set of largely dedicated transcriptional determinants: brn <dig> is expressed in many somatic sensory neurons, first and second order , somatic motoneurons uniquely co-express lhx3/ <dig> and mnx <dig>  while the vast majority of neurons, sensory and motor, involved in respiration, blood circulation or digestion are molecularly defined by their expression and dependence on the pan-visceral determinant phox2b.


RESULTS
we explore the status of the sensorimotor transcriptional code of vertebrates in mollusks, a lophotrochozoa clade that provides a rich repertoire of physiologically identified neurons. in the gastropods lymnaea stagnalis and aplysia californica, we show that homologues of brn <dig>  drgx, islet <dig>  mnx <dig>  lhx3/ <dig> and phox2b differentially mark neurons with mechanoreceptive, locomotory and cardiorespiratory functions. moreover, in the cephalopod sepia officinalis, we show that phox <dig> marks the stellate ganglion , while the anterior pedal ganglion, which controls the prehensile and locomotory arms, expresses mnx.


CONCLUSIONS
despite considerable divergence in overall neural architecture, a molecular underpinning for the functional allocation of neurons to interactions with the environment or to homeostasis was inherited from the urbilaterian ancestor by contemporary protostomes and deuterostomes.
