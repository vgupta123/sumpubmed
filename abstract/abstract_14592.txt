BACKGROUND
the life cycle of a bacteriophage has tightly programmed steps to help virus infect its host through the interactions between the bacteriophage and its host proteins. however, bacteriophage–host protein interactions in high temperature environment remain poorly understood. to address this issue, the protein interaction between the thermophilic bacteriophage gve <dig> and its host thermophilic geobacillus sp. e <dig> from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent was characterized.


RESULTS
this investigation showed that the host’s aspartate aminotransferase , chaperone groel, and viral capsid protein vp <dig> formed a linearly interacted complex. the results indicated that the vp371-groel-ast complex were up-regulated and co-localized in the gve <dig> infection of geobacillus sp. e <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
as reported, the vp <dig> is a capsid protein of gve <dig> and the host ast is essential for the gve <dig> infection. therefore, our study revealed that the phage could use the anti-stress system of its host to protect the virus reproduction in a high-temperature environment for the first time.
