BACKGROUND
due to the variation and mutation of the races of pseudoperonospora cubensis, downy mildew has in recent years become the most devastating leaf disease of cucumber worldwide. novel resistance to downy mildew has been identified in the wild cucumis species, c. hystrix chakr. after the successful hybridization between c. hystrix and cultivated cucumber , an introgression line  was identified as highly resistant to downy mildew. nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat  genes are the largest class of disease resistance genes cloned from plant with highly conserved domains, which can be used to facilitate the isolation of candidate genes associated with downy mildew resistance in il5211s.


RESULTS
degenerate primers that were designed based on the conserved motifs in the nbs domain of resistance  proteins were used to isolate nbs-type sequences from il5211s. a total of  <dig> sequences were identified and named as cucumber  resistance gene analogs as csrgas. polygenetic analyses separated these sequences into four different classes. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis showed that these csrgas expressed at different levels in leaves, roots, and stems. in addition, introgression from c. hystrix induced expression of the partial csrgas in cultivated cucumber, especially csrga <dig>  increased four-fold when compared to the backcross parent cc <dig>  furthermore, the expression of csrga <dig> under p. cubensis infection and abiotic stresses was also analyzed at different time points. results showed that the p. cubensis treatment and four tested abiotic stimuli, meja, sa, aba, and h2o <dig>  triggered a significant induction of csrga <dig> within  <dig> h of inoculation. the results indicate that csrga <dig> may play a critical role in protecting cucumber against p. cubensis through a signaling the pathway triggered by these molecules.


CONCLUSIONS
four classes of nbs-type rgas were successfully isolated from il5211s, and the possible involvement of csrga <dig> in the active defense response to p. cubensis was demonstrated. these results will contribute to develop analog-based markers related to downy mildew resistance gene and elucidate the molecular mechanisms causing resistance in il5211s in the future.
