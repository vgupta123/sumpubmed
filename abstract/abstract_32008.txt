BACKGROUND
in higher eukaryotes, small rnas play a role in regulating gene expression. overexpression  lines of arabidopsis thaliana purple acid phosphatase  <dig>  were shown to grow faster and exhibit higher atp and sugar contents. leaf microarray studies showed that many genes involved in micrornas  and trans-acting sirnas  biogenesis were significantly changed in the fast-growing lines. in this study, the srna profiles of the leaf and the root of 20-day-old plants were sequenced and the impacts of high energy status on srna expression were analyzed.


RESULTS
9- <dig> million reads from each library were mapped to genome. mirnas, tasirnas and natural antisense transcripts-generated small interfering rnas  were identified and compared between libraries. in the leaf of oe lines,  <dig> known mirnas increased in abundance and  <dig> mirnas decreased in abundance, whereas in the root of oe lines,  <dig> known mirnas increased in abundance and  <dig> mirnas decreased in abundance. mirnas with increased abundance in the leaf and root samples of both oe lines  were predicted to target mrnas coding for dof zinc finger protein and apetala  <dig>  proteins, respectively. furthermore, a significant change in the mir173-tasirnas-ppr/tpr network was observed in the leaves of both oe lines.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the impact of high energy content on the srna profiles of arabidopsis is reported. while the abundance of many stress-induced mirnas is unaltered, the abundance of some mirnas related to plant growth and development  is elevated in the fast-growing lines. an induction of mir173-tasirnas-ppr/tpr network was also observed in the oe lines. in contrast, only few cis- and trans-natsirnas are altered in the fast-growing lines.
