BACKGROUND
cdk5r <dig> plays a central role in neuronal migration and differentiation during central nervous system development. cdk5r <dig> has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and proposed as a candidate gene for mental retardation. the remarkable size of cdk5r <dig> 3'-untranslated region  suggests a role in post-transcriptional regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression.


RESULTS
the bioinformatic study shows a high conservation degree in mammals and predicts several au-rich elements . the insertion of cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr into luciferase 3'-utr causes a decreased luciferase activity in four transfected cell lines. we identified 3'-utr subregions which tend to reduce the reporter gene expression, sometimes in a cell line-dependent manner. in most cases the quantitative analysis of luciferase mrna suggests that cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr affects mrna stability. a region, leading to a very strong mrna destabilization, showed a significantly low half-life, indicating an accelerated mrna degradation. the 3' end of the transcript, containing a class i are, specifically displays a stabilizing effect in neuroblastoma cell lines. we also observed the interaction of the stabilizing neuronal rna-binding proteins elav with the cdk5r <dig> transcript in sh-sy5y cells and identified three 3'-utr sub-regions showing affinity for elav proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings evince the presence of both destabilizing and stabilizing regulatory elements in cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr and support the hypothesis that cdk5r <dig> gene expression is post-transcriptionally controlled in neurons by elav-mediated mechanisms. this is the first evidence of the involvement of 3'-utr in the modulation of cdk5r <dig> expression. the fine tuning of cdk5r <dig> expression by 3'-utr may have a role in central nervous system development and functioning, with potential implications in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.
