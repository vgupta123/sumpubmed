BACKGROUND
host rna-dependent rna polymerases   <dig> and  <dig> contribute to antiviral rna silencing in plants. rdr <dig> is constitutively expressed and was previously shown to limit invasion of nicotiana benthamiana meristem tissue by potato virus x and thereby inhibit disease development. rdr <dig> is inducible by salicylic acid  and several other phytohormones. but although it contributes to basal resistance to tobacco mosaic virus  it is dispensable for sa-induced resistance in inoculated leaves. the laboratory accession of n. benthamiana is a natural rdr <dig> mutant and highly susceptible to tmv. however, tmv-induced symptoms are ameliorated in transgenic plants expressing medicago truncatula rdr <dig> 


RESULTS
in mtrdr1-transgenic n. benthamiana plants the spread of tmv expressing the green fluorescent protein  into upper, non-inoculated, leaves was not inhibited. however, in these plants exclusion of tmv.gfp from the apical meristem and adjacent stem tissue was greater than in control plants and this exclusion effect was enhanced by sa. tmv normally kills n. benthamiana plants but although mtrdr1-transgenic plants initially displayed virus-induced necrosis they subsequently recovered. recovery from disease was markedly enhanced by sa treatment in mtrdr1-transgenic plants whereas in control plants sa delayed but did not prevent systemic necrosis and death. following sa treatment of mtrdr1-transgenic plants, extractable rdr enzyme activity was increased and western blot analysis of rdr extracts revealed a band cross-reacting with an antibody raised against mtrdr <dig>  expression of mtrdr <dig> in the transgenic n. benthamiana plants was driven by a constitutive 35s promoter derived from cauliflower mosaic virus, confirmed to be non-responsive to sa. this suggests that the effects of sa on mtrdr <dig> are exerted at a post-transcriptional level.


CONCLUSIONS
mtrdr <dig> inhibits severe symptom development by limiting spread of virus into the growing tips of infected plants. thus, rdr <dig> may act in a similar fashion to rdr <dig>  mtrdr <dig> and sa acted additively to further promote recovery from disease symptoms in mtrdr1-transgenic plants. thus it is possible that sa promotes mtrdr <dig> activity and/or stability through post-transcriptional effects.
