BACKGROUND
identification and classification of highly similar microbial strains is a challenging issue in microbiology, ecology and evolutionary biology. among various available approaches, gene content analysis is also at the core of microbial taxonomy. however, no threshold has been determined for grouping microorgnisms to different taxonomic levels, and it is still not clear that to what extent genomic fluidity should occur to form a microbial taxonomic group.


RESULTS
by taking advantage of the eggnog database for orthologous groups, we calculated gene content dissimilarity among different microbial strains based on the orthologous gene profiles and tested the possibility of applying gene content dissimilarity as a quantitative index in classifying microbial taxonomic groups, as well as its potential application in subclassification of highly similar microbial strains. evaluation of gene content dissimilarity to completed microbial genomes at different taxonomic levels suggested that cutoffs of  <dig>  and  <dig>  can be respectively used for species and family delineation, and that  <dig>  gene content dissimilarity cutoff approximately corresponded to 98 % 16s rrna gene identity and 94 % ani for microbial species delineation. furthermore, application of gene content dissimilarity to highly similar microbial strains suggested it as an effective approach in classifying closely related microorganisms into subgroups.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach is especially useful in identifying pathogens from commensals in clinical microbiology. it also provides novel insights into how genomic fluidity is linked with microbial taxonomy.
