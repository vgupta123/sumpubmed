BACKGROUND
non-small cell lung cancer  is one of the leading causes of death globally, and research into nsclc has been accumulating steadily over several years. drug repositioning is the current trend in the pharmaceutical industry for identifying potential new uses for existing drugs and accelerating the development process of drugs, as well as reducing side effects.


RESULTS
this work integrates two approaches - machine learning algorithms and topological parameter-based classification - to develop a novel pipeline of drug repositioning to analyze four lung cancer microarray datasets, enriched biological processes, potential therapeutic drugs and targeted genes for nsclc treatments. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  promising drugs  were discovered for treating early- and late-stage nsclc, respectively. the effectiveness of these drugs is supported by the literature, experimentally determined in-vitro ic <dig> and clinical trials. this work provides better drug prediction accuracy than competitive research according to ic <dig> measurements.


CONCLUSIONS
with the novel pipeline of drug repositioning, the discovery of enriched pathways and potential drugs related to nsclc can provide insight into the key regulators of tumorigenesis and the treatment of nsclc. based on the verified effectiveness of the targeted drugs predicted by this pipeline, we suggest that our drug-finding pipeline is effective for repositioning drugs.
