BACKGROUND
the senegalese sole, solea senegalensis, is a highly prized flatfish of growing commercial interest for aquaculture in southern europe. however, despite the industrial production of senegalese sole being hampered primarily by lack of information on the physiological mechanisms involved in reproduction, growth and immunity, very limited genomic information is available on this species.


RESULTS
sequencing of a s. senegalensis multi-tissue normalized cdna library, from adult tissues , larval stages , juvenile stages , and undifferentiated gonads, generated  <dig>  expressed sequence tags . clones were sequenced from the 3'-end to identify isoform specific sequences. assembly of the entire est collection into contigs gave  <dig>  unique sequences of which  <dig>   had matches in genbank, thus showing a low level of redundancy. the sequence of the  <dig>  unigenes was used to design and validate an oligonucleotide microarray representing  <dig>  unique senegalese sole transcripts. finally, a novel interactive bioinformatic platform, soleamold, was developed for the senegalese sole est collection as well as microarray and ish data.


CONCLUSIONS
new genomic resources have been developed for s. senegalensis, an economically important fish in aquaculture, which include a collection of expressed genes, an oligonucleotide microarray, and a publicly available bioinformatic platform that can be used to study gene expression in this species. these resources will help elucidate transcriptional regulation in wild and captive senegalese sole for optimization of its production under intensive culture conditions.
