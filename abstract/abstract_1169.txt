BACKGROUND
using novel small-molecular inhibitors, we explored the feasibility of the class i pi3k/akt/mtorc <dig> signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in canine oncology either by using pathway inhibitors alone, in combination or combined with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that growth and survival of the cell lines tested are predominantly dependent on class i pi3k/akt signaling rather than mtorc <dig> signaling. in addition, the newly developed inhibitors zstk <dig> and kp372- <dig> which selectively target pan-class i pi3k and akt, respectively, and rapamycin which has been well-established as highly specific mtor inhibitor, decrease viability of canine cancer cell lines. all inhibitors demonstrated inhibition of phosphorylation of pathway members. annexin v staining demonstrated that kp372- <dig> is a potent inducer of apoptosis whereas zstk <dig> and rapamycin are weaker inducers of apoptosis. simultaneous inhibition of class i pi3k and mtorc <dig> by zstk <dig> combined with rapamycin additively or synergistically reduced cell viability whereas responses to the pi3k pathway inhibitors in combination with conventional drug doxorubicin were cell line-dependent.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlighted the importance of class i pi3k/akt axis signaling in canine tumour cells and identifies it as a promising therapeutic target.
