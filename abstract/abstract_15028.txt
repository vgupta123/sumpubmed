BACKGROUND
a-to-i rna-editing mediated by adar  enzymes that converts adenosine to inosine in rna sequence can generate mutations and alter gene regulation in metazoans. previous studies have shown that a-to-i rna-editing plays vital roles in mouse embryogenesis. however, the rna-editing activities in early human embryonic development have not been investigated.


RESULTS
here, we characterized genome-wide a-to-i rna-editing activities during human early embryogenesis by profiling  <dig> single cells from  <dig> human embryos spanning from oocyte to morula stages. we demonstrate dynamic changes in genome-wide rna-editing during early human embryogenesis in a stage-specific fashion. in parallel with adar expression level changes, the genome-wide a-to-i rna-editing levels in cells remained relatively stable until 4-cell stage, but dramatically decreased at 8-cell stage, continually decreased at morula stage. we detected  <dig> non-synonymously rna-edited genes, of which  <dig> were frequently found in cells of multiple embryonic stages. moreover, we found that a-to-i editings in mirna-targeted regions of a substantial number of genes preferably occurred in one or two sequential stages.


CONCLUSIONS
our single-cell analysis reveals dynamic changes in genome-wide rna-editing during early human embryogenesis in a stage-specific fashion, and provides important insights into early human embryogenesis.
