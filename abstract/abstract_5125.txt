BACKGROUND
array-based comparative genomic hybridization  and gene expression profiling have become vital techniques for identifying molecular defects underlying genetic diseases. regardless of the microarray platform, cyanine dyes  are one of the most widely used fluorescent dye pairs for microarray analysis owing to their brightness and ease of incorporation, enabling high level of assay sensitivity. however, combining both dyes on arrays can become problematic during summer months when ozone levels rise to near  <dig> parts per billion . under such conditions, cy <dig> is known to rapidly degrade leading to loss of signal from either "homebrew" or commercial arrays. cy <dig> can also suffer disproportionately from dye photobleaching resulting in distortion of  ratios used in copy number analysis. our laboratory has been active in fluorescent dye research to find a suitable alternative to cy <dig> that is stable to ozone and resistant to photo-bleaching. here, we report on the development of such a dye, called hyper <dig>  and describe its' exceptional ozone and photostable properties on microarrays.


RESULTS
our results show hyper <dig> signal to be stable to high ozone levels. repeated exposure of mouse arrays hybridized with hyper5-labeled cdna to  <dig> ppb ozone at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minute intervals resulted in no signal loss from the dye. in comparison, cy <dig> arrays showed a dramatic 80% decrease in total signal during the same interval. photobleaching experiments show hyper <dig> to be resistant to light induced damage with 3- fold improvement in dye stability over cy <dig>  in high resolution array cgh experiments, hyper <dig> is demonstrated to detect chromosomal aberrations at loci 2p21- <dig>  and 15q <dig> - <dig>  from three patient sample using bacterial artificial chromosome  arrays. the photostability of hyper <dig> is further documented by repeat array scanning without loss of detection. additionally, hyper <dig> arrays are shown to preserve sensitivity and data quality from gene expression experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
hyper <dig> is a red fluorescent dye that behaves functionally similar to cy <dig> except in stability to ozone and light. hyper <dig> is demonstrated to be resistant to ozone at up to  <dig> ppb, levels significantly higher than commonly observed during summer months. consequently, hyper <dig> dye can be used in parallel with cy <dig> under any environmental conditions in array experiments.
