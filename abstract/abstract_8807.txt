BACKGROUND
current cognitive neuroscience models predict a right-hemispheric dominance for face processing in humans. however, neuroimaging and electromagnetic data in the literature provide conflicting evidence of a right-sided brain asymmetry for decoding the structural properties of faces. the purpose of this study was to investigate whether this inconsistency might be due to gender differences in hemispheric asymmetry.


RESULTS
in this study, event-related brain potentials  were recorded in  <dig> healthy, strictly right-handed individuals  while they observed infants' faces expressing a variety of emotions. early face-sensitive p <dig> and n <dig> responses to neutral vs. affective expressions were measured over the occipital/temporal cortices, and the responses were analyzed according to viewer gender. along with a strong right hemispheric dominance for men, the results showed a lack of asymmetry for face processing in the amplitude of the occipito-temporal n <dig> response in women to both neutral and affective faces.


CONCLUSIONS
men showed an asymmetric functioning of visual cortex while decoding faces and expressions, whereas women showed a more bilateral functioning. these results indicate the importance of gender effects in the lateralization of the occipito-temporal response during the processing of face identity, structure, familiarity, or affective content.
