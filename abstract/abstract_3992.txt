BACKGROUND
wnt <dig> is an evolutionarily ancient member of the wnt family. in drosophila, wnt <dig> loss-of-function animals have not yet been reported, hence information about fly wnt <dig> function is lacking. in wing discs, wnt <dig> is expressed at the dorsal/ventral boundary in a pattern similar to that of wingless, an important regulator of wing size. to test whether wnt <dig> also contributes towards wing size regulation, we generated wnt <dig> knockout flies.


RESULTS
wnt <dig> knockout flies are viable and have no obvious defect in wing size or planar cell polarity. surprisingly, wnt <dig> knockouts lack maxillary palps. interestingly, wnt <dig> is absent from the genome of hemipterans, correlating with the absence of maxillary palps in these insects.


CONCLUSIONS
wnt <dig> is important for maxillary palp development in drosophila, and phylogenetic analysis indicates that loss of wnt <dig> may also have led to loss of maxillary palps on an evolutionary time scale.
