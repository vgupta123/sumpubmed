BACKGROUND
enzymes have found extensive and growing application in the field of chemical organic synthesis and resolution of chiral intermediates. in order to stabilise the enzymes and to facilitate their recovery and recycle, they are frequently immobilised. however, immobilisation onto solid supports greatly reduces the volumetric and specific activity of the biocatalysts. an alternative is to form self-immobilised enzyme particles.


RESULTS
through addition of protein cross-linking agents to a water-in-oil emulsion of an aqueous enzyme solution, structured self-immobilised spherical enzyme particles of pseudomonas fluorescens lipase were formed. the particles could be recovered from the emulsion, and activity in aqueous and organic solvents was successfully demonstrated. preliminary data indicates that the lipase tended to collect at the interface.


CONCLUSIONS
the immobilised particles provide a number of advantages. the individual spherical particles had a diameter of between  <dig> – <dig> μm, but tended to form aggregates with an average particle volume distribution of  <dig> μm. the size could be controlled through addition of surfactant and variations in protein concentration. the particles were robust enough to be recovered by centrifugation and filtration, and to be recycled for further reactions. they present lipase enzymes with the active sites selectively orientated towards the exterior of the particle. co-immobilisation with other enzymes, or other proteins such as albumin, was also demonstrated. moreover, higher activity for small ester molecules could be achieved by the immobilised enzyme particles than for free enzyme, presumably because the lipase conformation required for catalysis had been locked in place during immobilisation. the immobilised enzymes also demonstrated superior activity in organic solvent compared to the original free enzyme. this type of self-immobilised enzyme particle has been named spherezymes.
