BACKGROUND
little is known about the genome sequences of lepidopteran insects, although this group of insects has been studied extensively in the fields of endocrinology, development, immunity, and pathogen-host interactions. in addition, cell lines derived from spodoptera frugiperda and other lepidopteran insects are routinely used for baculovirus foreign gene expression. this study reports the results of an expressed sequence tag  sequencing project in cells from the lepidopteran insect s. frugiperda, the fall armyworm.


RESULTS
we have constructed an est database using two cdna libraries from the s. frugiperda-derived cell line, sf- <dig>  the database consists of  <dig>  ests which were assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets for a total of  <dig>  unique sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
s. frugiperda is an agriculturally important pest insect and genomic information will be instrumental for establishing initial transcriptional profiling and gene function studies, and for obtaining information about genes manipulated during infections by insect pathogens such as baculoviruses.
