BACKGROUND
cotton  is the most important fiber crop grown in  <dig> countries. in 2004– <dig>  us farmers planted 79% of the  <dig> -million hectares of nuclear transgenic cotton. unfortunately, genetically modified cotton has the potential to hybridize with other cultivated and wild relatives, resulting in geographical restrictions to cultivation. however, chloroplast genetic engineering offers the possibility of containment because of maternal inheritance of transgenes. the complete chloroplast genome of cotton provides essential information required for genetic engineering. in addition, the sequence data were used to assess phylogenetic relationships among the major clades of rosids using cotton and  <dig> other completely sequenced angiosperm chloroplast genomes.


RESULTS
the complete cotton chloroplast genome is  <dig>  bp in length, with  <dig> unique genes and  <dig> duplicated genes within the ir, containing a total of  <dig> genes. there are four ribosomal rnas,  <dig> distinct trna genes and  <dig> intron-containing genes. the gene order in cotton is identical to that of tobacco but lacks rpl <dig> and infa. there are  <dig> direct and  <dig> inverted repeats  <dig> bp or longer with a sequence identity ≥ 90%. most of the direct repeats are within intergenic spacer regions, introns and a  <dig> bp-long direct repeat is within the psaa and psab genes. comparison of protein coding sequences with expressed sequence tags  revealed nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid changes in ndhc, rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and clpp. phylogenetic analysis of a data set including  <dig> protein-coding genes using both maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony were performed for  <dig> taxa, including cotton and five other angiosperm chloroplast genomes that were not included in any previous phylogenies.


CONCLUSIONS
cotton chloroplast genome lacks rpl <dig> and infa and contains a number of dispersed direct and inverted repeats. rna editing resulted in amino acid changes with significant impact on their hydropathy. phylogenetic analysis provides strong support for the position of cotton in the malvales in the eurosids ii clade sister to arabidopsis in the brassicales. furthermore, there is strong support for the placement of the myrtales sister to the eurosid i clade, although expanded taxon sampling is needed to further test this relationship.
