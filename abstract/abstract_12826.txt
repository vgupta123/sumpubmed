BACKGROUND
the mammalian protein kinase tlk <dig> is a homologue of tousled, a gene involved in flower development in arabidopsis thaliana. the function of tlk <dig> is not well known, although knockout of the gene in drosophila, or expression of a dominant negative mutant in mouse mammary cells causes loss of nuclear divisions and chromosome mis-segregation. tlk1b is a splice variant of tlk <dig> and it confers radioresistance in a normal mammary mouse cell line possibly due to increased chromatin remodeling capacity, but the mechanism of resistance remains to be fully elucidated.


RESULTS
we now show that tlk1b also affords protection against uv radiation. we find that nuclear extracts isolated from tlk1b-containing mouse cells promote more efficient chromatin assembly than comparable extracts lacking tlk1b. tlk1b-containing extracts are also more efficient in repair of uv-damaged plasmid dna assembled into nucleosomes. one of the two known substrates of tlk <dig>  is the histone chaperone asf <dig>  and immuno-inactivation experiments suggest that tlk1b increases uv-repair through the action of asf <dig> on chromatin assembly/disassembly.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies provide evidence for tlk1b-mediated phosphorylation of asf <dig> triggering dna repair. we suggest that this occurs via asf1-mediated chromatin assembly at the sites of uv damage.
