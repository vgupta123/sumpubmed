BACKGROUND
this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the molecular phenotype of the primary mammary tumor and its related lymph node metastasis in the dog to develop prognostic-predictive models and targeted therapeutic options.


RESULTS
twenty mammary tumor samples and their lymph node metastases were selected and stained by immunohistochemistry with anti-estrogen receptor , -progesterone receptor , -human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig> , -cytokeratin 5/ <dig> , -cytokeratin  <dig> , -cytokeratin  <dig>  and -protein  <dig>  antibodies. four phenotypes  were diagnosed in primary tumors and five  in the lymph node metastases. phenotypic concordance was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> cases , and seven cases  showed discordance with different lymph node phenotypic profile from the primary tumor.


CONCLUSIONS
the phenotype of the primary tumor assumes a predictive-therapeutic role only in concordant cases, meaning that both the primary tumor and its lymph node metastasis should be evaluated at the same time. a treatment plan based only on the primary tumor phenotype could lead to therapeutic failures if the phenotype of the lymph node metastasis differs from that of the primary tumor.
