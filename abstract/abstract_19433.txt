BACKGROUND
amino acids responsible for structure, core function or specificity may be inferred from multiple protein sequence alignments where a limited set of residue types are tolerated. the rise in available protein sequences continues to increase the power of techniques based on this principle.


RESULTS
a new algorithm, smerfs, for predicting protein functional sites from multiple sequences alignments was compared to  <dig> conservation measures and to the miner algorithm. validation was performed on an automatically generated dataset of  <dig> families derived from the protein interactions database snappi-db, and a smaller manually curated set of  <dig> families. the best performing measure overall was williamson property entropy, with roc <dig>  scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for domain and small molecule contact prediction, respectively. the lancet method performed worse than random on protein-protein interaction site prediction . the smerfs algorithm gave similar accuracy to the phylogenetic tree-based miner algorithm but was superior to williamson in prediction of non-catalytic transient complex interfaces. smerfs predicts sites that are significantly more solvent accessible compared to williamson.


CONCLUSIONS
williamson property entropy is the the best performing of  <dig> conservation measures examined. the difference in performance of smerfs relative to williamson in manually defined complexes was dependent on complex type. the best choice of analysis method is therefore dependent on the system of interest. additional computation employed by miner in calculation of phylogenetic trees did not produce improved results over smerfs. smerfs performance was improved by use of windows over alignment columns, illustrating the necessity of considering the local environment of positions when assessing their functional significance.
