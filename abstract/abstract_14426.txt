BACKGROUND
trypanosomatid genomes are highly colonized by non-ltr retroelements that make up to 5 % of the nuclear genome. these elements are mainly accumulated in the strand switch regions  where polycistronic transcription is initiated and have a 77 nt-long sequence - pr <dig> - at their 5′ ends. l1tc is the best represented retrotransposon in the trypanosoma cruzi genome and is a potentially functional autonomous element that encodes its own retrotransposition machinery. the pr <dig> of the t. cruzi l1tc element activates gene transcription via rna polymerase ii, generating abundant, unspliced transcripts which are translated.


RESULTS
the present manuscript describes the identification of a downstream core promoter element  in the l1tc pr <dig> sequence. just four nucleotides long , it covers in pr <dig> positions + <dig> to + <dig> of the described l1tc transcription start site. the pr77-dpe motif is conserved in terms of sequence composition and position in the pr <dig> of most trypanosomatid non-ltr retrotransposons, independent of the coding or non-coding capacity of these retroelements. transcription assays in t. cruzi stable transfectants with vector containing point mutations at  <dig> locations of the pr <dig> nucleotide sequence evidence that the dpe motif is essential for the promoter function of pr <dig>  furthermore, the obtained data show that other nucleotides also contributed to the promoter function of pr <dig>  in addition, the presented results indicate that parasite nuclear proteins specifically bind to different regions of the pr <dig> sequence although the strongest binding is to the dpe motif. moreover, it is shown that the dpe sense single-stranded sequence is being required in dna-protein recognition of nuclear factors.


CONCLUSIONS
the pr <dig> sequence present in most of non-ltr retrotransposons of trypanosomatids contains a downstream core promoter element  which is conserved in terms of nucleotide composition and location. the pr77-dpe motif is essential for the transcriptional activity of pr <dig> although other nucleotides are also involved. dpe has a high affinity binding for nuclear proteins in t. cruzi. the wide retroelement-mediated distribution of pr <dig> suggests that it may represent an important tool for regulating gene expression in trypanosomatids.
