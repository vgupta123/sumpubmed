BACKGROUND
inference of protein interaction networks from various sources of data has become an important topic of both systems and computational biology. here we present a supervised approach to identification of gene expression regulatory networks.


RESULTS
the method is based on a kernel approach accompanied with genetic programming. as a data source, the method utilizes gene expression time series for prediction of interactions among regulatory proteins and their target genes. the performance of the method was verified using saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle and dna/rna/protein biosynthesis gene expression data. the results were compared with independent data sources. finally, a prediction of novel interactions within yeast gene expression circuits has been performed.


CONCLUSIONS
results show that our algorithm gives, in most cases, results identical with the independent experiments, when compared with the yeastract database. in several cases our algorithm gives predictions of novel interactions which have not been reported.
