BACKGROUND
during the photosynthesis, two isoforms of the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase , the chloroplastidial  and the cytosolic , catalyse the first irreversible step during the conversion of triose phosphates  to starch or sucrose, respectively. deficiency in cyfbp and cfbp <dig> isoforms provokes an imbalance of the starch/sucrose ratio, causing a dramatic effect on plant development when the plastidial enzyme is lacking.


RESULTS
we study the correlation between the transcriptome and proteome profile in rosettes and roots when cfbp <dig> or cyfbp genes are disrupted in arabidopsis thaliana knock-out mutants. by using a 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray representing the genome of arabidopsis we were able to identify  <dig> and  <dig> genes whose expressions are altered in the rosettes and roots of the cfbp <dig> mutant respectively; whilst in rosettes and roots of cyfbp mutant  <dig> and  <dig> genes are being up- or down-regulated respectively. quantitative real-time pcr validated 100% of a set of  <dig> selected genes differentially expressed according to our microarray analysis. two-dimensional  gel electrophoresis-based proteomic analysis revealed quantitative differences in  <dig> and  <dig> proteins regulated in rosettes and roots of cfbp <dig>  respectively, whereas the  <dig> and  <dig> others were regulated in rosettes and roots of cyfbp mutant, respectively. the genes differentially expressed and the proteins more or less abundant revealed changes in protein metabolism, rna regulation, cell signalling and organization, carbon metabolism, redox regulation, and transport together with biotic and abiotic stress. notably, a significant set  of the proteins identified were also found to be regulated at a transcriptional level.


CONCLUSIONS
this transcriptomic and proteomic analysis is the first comprehensive and comparative study of the gene/protein re-adjustment that occurs in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs of arabidopsis mutants lacking fbpase isoforms.
