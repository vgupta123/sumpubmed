BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium frequently encountered in hospitals as a contaminant of injectable material and surfaces. this psychrotrophic bacterium, commonly described as unable to grow at temperatures above 32°c, is now considered non pathogenic. we studied a recently identified clinical strain of p. fluorescens biovar i, mfn <dig>  which is considered to cause human lung infection and can grow at 37°c in laboratory conditions.


RESULTS
we found that mfn <dig> secreted extracellular factors with a lytic potential at least as high as that of mf <dig>  a psychrotrophic strain of p. fluorescens or the mesophilic opportunistic pathogen, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig>  we demonstrated the direct, and indirect – through increases in biosurfactant release – involvement of a phospholipase c in the hemolytic activity of this bacterium. sequence analysis assigned this phospholipase c to a new group of phospholipases c different from those produced by p. aeruginosa. we show that changes in plcc production have pleiotropic effects and that plcc overexpression and plcc extinction increase mfn <dig> toxicity and colonization, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first demonstration that a plc is involved in the secreted hemolytic activity of a clinical strain of pseudomonas fluorescens. moreover, this phospholipase c seems to belong to a complex biological network associated with the biosurfactant production.
