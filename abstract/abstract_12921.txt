BACKGROUND
genomic dna methylation affects approximately 1% of dna bases in humans, with the most common event being the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine residue present in the cpg  dinucleotide. methylation is of particular interest because of its role in gene silencing in many pathological conditions. cpg methylation can be measured using a wide range of techniques, including methylation-specific  pcr, pyrosequencing , bisulfite sequencing  and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme  pcr. however, although it is possible to utilise these methods to measure cpg methylation, optimisation of the assays can be complicated due to the absence of suitable control dna samples.


RESULTS
to address this problem, we have developed an approach that employs multiple displacement based whole genome amplification  with or without sssi-methylase treatment to generate cpg methylated and cpg unmethylated dna, respectively, that come from the same source dna.


CONCLUSIONS
using these alternately methylated dna samples, we have been able to develop and optimise reliable ms-pcr, psq, bs and mrse-pcr assays for cpg methylation detection, which would otherwise not have been possible, or at least have been significantly more difficult.
