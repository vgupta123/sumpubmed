BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin ligase cop <dig>  constitutively photomorphogenic  <dig>  functions in many biological responses in mammalian cells, but its downstream pathway remains unclear.


RESULTS
here, we identified fip <dig>  a key regulator of mammalian autophagy, as a novel cop1-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. the interaction was confirmed by a gst-pulldown assay. split-gfp analysis revealed that interaction between cop <dig> and fip <dig> predominantly occurred in the cytoplasm and was enhanced in cells treated with uv irradiation. different forms of fip <dig> protein were expressed in cultured mammalian cells, and ectopic expression of cop <dig> reduced one of such forms.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that cop <dig> modulates fip200-associated activities, which may contribute to a variety of cellular functions that cop <dig> is involved in.
