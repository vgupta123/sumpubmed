BACKGROUND
the population of dogs and cats passing through rescue shelters may be subject to compromised welfare and increased susceptibility to disease. little information exists to describe this population, its dynamics and associated management practices. the aim of this study was to carry out a census of un-owned cats and dogs in the uk in  <dig>  and to document the origins, destinations, husbandry and costs associated with the care of these animals.


RESULTS
a sampling frame was constructed by searching the databases of publicly registered charities for england, scotland and wales, registers of breed rescues, and by internet searches of animal welfare websites. overall,  <dig>  contacts for  <dig>  organisations were identified. all were sent a postal questionnaire asking for data on the number of dogs and cats housed, their origins and eventual outcomes, and details of husbandry between january 1st and december 31st  <dig>  for those which were registered charities , financial records were also obtained.

a response rate of  <dig> % was obtained. overall, in  <dig>   <dig>  dogs and  <dig>  cats entered the care of the participating organisations. approximately half of these animals were relinquished by their owners. other origins included being found as strays or confiscated for welfare purposes. seventy-five per cent of dogs and  <dig> % of cats were rehomed. the next most common outcome was euthanasia, accounting for  <dig> % of dogs and  <dig> % cats. for dogs and cats,  <dig> % and 62% of participants respectively reported having a waiting list, which frequently exceeded the actual capacity of the facility. over  <dig>  people were involved in the care of these animals, on a paid or voluntary basis. financial records were available for 519/ <dig>  of the registered charities, and their total expenditure in  <dig> was Â£ <dig> million.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that a large number of animals become un-owned each year, which could have considerable implications for their welfare. despite the resources expended, demand still exceeds capacity for many organisations, and a substantial number of both cats and dogs are euthanased, suggesting that further understanding of how and why these animals become un-owned is essential in order to target interventions.
