BACKGROUND
flying lemurs or colugos  represent an ancient mammalian lineage that contains only two extant species. although molecular evidence strongly supports that the orders dermoptera, scandentia, lagomorpha, rodentia and primates form a superordinal clade called supraprimates , the phylogenetic placement of dermoptera within supraprimates remains ambiguous.


RESULTS
to search for cytogenetic signatures that could help to clarify the evolutionary affinities within this superordinal group, we have established a genome-wide comparative map between human and the malayan flying lemur  by reciprocal chromosome painting using both human and g. variegatus chromosome-specific probes. the  <dig> human autosomal paints and the x chromosome paint defined  <dig> homologous segments in the g. variegatus genome. a putative inversion on gva  <dig> was revealed by the hybridization patterns of human chromosome probes  <dig> and  <dig>  fifteen associations of human chromosome segments  were detected in the g. variegatus genome: hsa1/ <dig>  1/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  10/ <dig>  12/ <dig> , 14/ <dig>  16/ <dig> . reverse painting of g. variegatus chromosome-specific paints onto human chromosomes confirmed the above results, and defined the origin of the homologous human chromosomal segments in these associations. in total, g. variegatus paints revealed  <dig> homologous chromosomal segments in the hsa genome.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis of our map with published maps from representative species of other placental orders, including scandentia, primates, lagomorpha and rodentia, suggests a signature rearrangement  that links scandentia and dermoptera to one sister clade. our results thus provide new evidence for the hypothesis that scandentia and dermoptera have a closer phylogenetic relationship to each other than either of them has to primates.
