BACKGROUND

toxoplasma gondii, a widely prevalent protozoan parasite, causes serious toxoplasmosis infections in humans and other animals. among livestock, pigs are susceptible to t. gondii infection. despite henan being one of the biggest pig-raising provinces in china, little information exists on the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis in this location. therefore, we molecularly characterized dna samples from pigs in henan. a total of  <dig> samples, including  <dig> from dead piglets,  <dig> from seriously sick fattening pigs and  <dig> from abortion sows, were collected from different animal hospitals or pig farms from  <dig> different cities in henan . each pig corresponded to a separate pig farm. dna was extracted from  <dig> to 5 g of the most severely affected pig tissue  after postmortem examination. the presence of the t. gondii b <dig> gene was detected using nested polymerase chain reactions . genotyping was performed directly on dna from the pcr-positive tissue samples using  <dig> pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism markers .


RESULTS
of all samples, thirty-four were positive for the t. gondii b <dig> gene  from four cities, including  <dig> from nanyang city, one  from xinyang city, one  from zhengzhou city and one  from zhoukou city. the prevalence was found to be highest in piglets than in fattening pigs and sows. and the difference was statistically significant . the following  <dig> samples were genotyped with complete data:  <dig> hilar lymph node tissue samples, seven liver tissue samples, seven lung tissue samples, four spleen tissue samples, and one amniotic fluid sample. only one genotype, belonging to toxodb genotype # <dig>  was identified.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first large-scale survey molecularly characterizing t. gondii from pigs in henan. the results of the present study revealed that t. gondii infection is present in swine in henan and is a potential source of foodborne toxoplasmosis in the investigated areas. implementation of effective control measures for t. gondii to reduce the chance of zoonotic toxoplasmosis spreading from pig farms may be warranted. the results show that the toxodb # <dig> genotype may be the dominant t. gondii lineage in mainland china. these findings strengthen the limited chinese t. gondii epidemiology database.
