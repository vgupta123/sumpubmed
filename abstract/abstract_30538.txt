BACKGROUND
oligonucleotide microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  offers an attractive possible route for the rapid and cost-effective genome-wide discovery of deletion mutations. cgh typically involves comparison of the hybridization intensities of genomic dna samples with microarray chip representations of entire genomes, and has widespread potential application in experimental research and medical diagnostics. however, the power to detect small deletions is low.


RESULTS
here we use a graduated series of arabidopsis thaliana genomic deletion mutations  to optimize cgh-based genomic deletion detection. we show that the power to detect smaller deletions  depends upon oligonucleotide density , and determine the oligonucleotide spacings necessary to guarantee detection of deletions of specified size.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings will enhance a wide range of research and clinical applications, and in particular will aid in the discovery of genomic deletions in the absence of a priori knowledge of their existence.
