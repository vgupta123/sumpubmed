BACKGROUND
tol <dig>  a member of the hat family of transposons, has become a useful tool for genetic manipulation of model animals, but information about its interactions with vertebrate genomes is still limited. furthermore, published reports on tol <dig> have mainly been based on random integration of the transposon system after co-injection of a plasmid dna harboring the transposon and a transposase mrna. it is important to understand how tol <dig> would behave upon activation after integration into the genome.


RESULTS
we performed a large-scale enhancer trap  screen and generated  <dig> insertions of the tol <dig> transposon-based et cassette into the zebrafish genome. these insertions were generated by remobilizing the transposon from two different donor sites in two transgenic lines. we found that 39% of tol <dig> insertions occurred in transcription units, mostly into introns. analysis of the transposon target sites revealed no strict specificity at the dna sequence level. however, tol <dig> was prone to target at-rich regions with weak palindromic consensus sequences centered at the insertion site.


CONCLUSIONS
our systematic analysis of sequential remobilizations of the tol <dig> transposon from two independent sites within a vertebrate genome has revealed properties such as a tendency to integrate into transcription units and into at-rich palindrome-like sequences. this information will influence the development of various applications involving dna transposons and tol <dig> in particular.
