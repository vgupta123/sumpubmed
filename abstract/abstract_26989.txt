BACKGROUND
bifidobacterium represents one of the largest genus within the actinobacteria, and includes at present  <dig> species. these species share a high sequence homology of 16s rdna and several molecular techniques already applied to discriminate among them give ambiguous results.

the slightly higher variability of the hsp <dig> gene sequences with respect to the 16s rrna sequences offers better opportunities to design or develop molecular assays, allowing identification and differentiation of closely related species. hsp <dig> can be considered an excellent additional marker for inferring the taxonomy of the members of bifidobacterium genus.


RESULTS
this work illustrates a simple and cheap molecular tool for the identification of bifidobacterium species. the hsp <dig> universal primers were used in a simple pcr procedure for the direct amplification of 590Â bp of the hsp <dig> sequence. the in silico restriction analysis of bifidobacterial hsp <dig> partial sequences allowed the identification of a single endonuclease  able to provide different pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  patterns in the bifidobacterium spp. type strains evaluated. the electrophoretic analyses allowed to confirm the different rflp patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
the developed pcr-rflp technique resulted in efficient discrimination of the tested species and subspecies and allowed the construction of a dichotomous key in order to differentiate the most widely distributed bifidobacterium species as well as the subspecies belonging to b. pseudolongum and b. animalis.
