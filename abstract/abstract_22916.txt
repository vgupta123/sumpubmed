BACKGROUND
the rapid advancements in the field of genome sequencing are aiding our understanding on many biological systems. in the last five years, computational biologists and bioinformatics specialists have come up with newer, better and more efficient tools towards the discovery, analysis and interpretation of different genomic variants from high-throughput sequencing data. availability of reliable simulated dataset is essential and is the first step towards testing any newly developed analytical tools for variant discovery. although there are tools currently available that can simulate variants, none present the possibility of simulating all the three major types of variations  and can generate reads taking a realistic error-model into consideration. therefore, an efficient simulator and read generator is needed that can simulate variants taking the error rates of true biological samples into consideration.


RESULTS
we report sinc  an open-source variant simulator and read generator capable of simulating all the three common types of biological variants taking into account a distribution of base quality score from a most commonly used next-generation sequencing instrument from illumina. sinc is capable of generating single- and paired-end reads with user-defined insert size and with high efficiency compared to the other existing tools. sinc, due to its multi-threaded capability during read generation, has a low time footprint. sinc is currently optimised to work in limited infrastructure setup and can efficiently exploit the commonly used quad-core desktop architecture to simulate short sequence reads with deep coverage for large genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
we have come up with a user-friendly multi-variant simulator and read-generator tools called sinc. sinc can be downloaded from
