BACKGROUND
hypodontia, the congenital absence of one or a few teeth is one of the most common alterations of the human dentition. familial hypodontia is caused by mutations in pax <dig>  msx <dig> and axin <dig> genes. limited numbers of studies are present to show etiological factors beyond this anomaly in turkish community belonging to caucasian racial family. the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between the two different single nucleotide polymorphisms that are g-1031a and t-912c with hypodontia in caucasians.

 <dig> individuals having hypodontia and  <dig> normal individuals having all  <dig> teeth present were selected for the study. blood samples were collected from each individual and dna was extracted. to determine the polymorphisms, pcr-rflp method was used.


RESULTS
the outcomes suggest that the individuals having ac haplotype carry less risk in having hypodontia compared with the rest of the haplotype groups . the ratio of gt haplotype is less in the hypodontia group meaning that the gt carriers are in risk group in terms of hypodontia risk.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that polymorphisms in the promoter region of pax <dig> gene may have an influence on the transcriptional factors and activity of this gene and are associated with hypodontia in caucasian individuals.
