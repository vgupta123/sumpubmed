BACKGROUND
the transport of livestock can have major implications for their welfare, and there is strong public interest and scientific endeavour aimed at ensuring that the welfare of transported animals is optimal. the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of transport on live weight, physiological and haematological responses of bulls after road transport of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours . seventy-two charolais bulls   <dig>  kg), na√Øve to transport, were randomly assigned to one of six journey  times of  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h transport  at a stocking density of  <dig>  m2/bull. blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture before transport , immediately after  and at  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h relative to time  <dig> h. the bulls were weighed before transport , immediately after , and at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h relative to time  <dig> h. control animals were blood sampled before assignment  to novel pens, after , and at  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h relative to the  <dig> h sampling time point.


RESULTS
bulls travelling for  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  lost  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   percentage  live weight compared with baseline. live weight re-gained to pre-transport levels during the  <dig> h recovery period. lymphocyte percentages were lower  and neutrophil percentages were greater  in all animals. blood protein, glucose and nefa concentrations and creatine kinase activity were greater  in the bulls following transport and returned to baseline within  <dig> h.


CONCLUSIONS
under the conditions of the present study, transport of bulls on journeys by road, ranging from  <dig> h  to  <dig> h  duration, affected live weight, haematological and physiological measurements of metabolism and inflammation. our findings showed that live weight and some physiological and haematological responses of bulls returned to pre-transport levels within  <dig> h with animals having had access to feed and water.
