BACKGROUND
japanese encephalitis virus  ns <dig> is a viral nonstructural protein that carries both methyltransferase and rna-dependent rna polymerase  domains. it is a key component of the viral rna replicase complex that presumably includes other viral nonstructural and cellular proteins. the biochemical properties of jev ns <dig> have not been characterized due to the lack of a robust in vitro rdrp assay system, and the molecular mechanisms for the initiation of rna synthesis by jev ns <dig> remain to be elucidated.


RESULTS
to characterize the biochemical properties of jev rdrp, we expressed in escherichia coli and purified an enzymatically active full-length recombinant jev ns <dig> protein with a hexahistidine tag at the n-terminus. the purified ns <dig> protein, but not the mutant ns <dig> protein with an ala substitution at the first asp of the rdrp-conserved gdd motif, exhibited template- and primer-dependent rna synthesis activity using a poly rna template. the ns <dig> protein was able to use both plus- and minus-strand 3'-untranslated regions of the jev genome as templates in the absence of a primer, with the latter rna being a better template. analysis of the rna synthesis initiation site using the 3'-end  <dig> nucleotides of the jev genome as a minimal rna template revealed that the ns <dig> protein specifically initiates rna synthesis from an internal site, u <dig>  at the two nucleotides upstream of the 3'-end of the template.


CONCLUSIONS
as a first step toward the understanding of the molecular mechanisms for jev rna replication and ultimately for the in vitro reconstitution of viral rna replicase complex, we for the first time established an in vitro jev rdrp assay system with a functional full-length recombinant jev ns <dig> protein and characterized the mechanisms of rna synthesis from nonviral and viral rna templates. the full-length recombinant jev ns <dig> will be useful for the elucidation of the structure-function relationship of this enzyme and for the development of anti-jev agents.
