BACKGROUND
while the gargantuan multi-nation effort of sequencing t. aestivum gets close to completion, the annotation process for the vast number of wheat genes and proteins is in its infancy. previous experimental studies carried out on model plant organisms such as a. thaliana and o. sativa provide a plethora of gene annotations that can be used as potential starting points for wheat gene annotations, proven that solid cross-species gene-to-gene and protein-to-protein correspondences are provided.


RESULTS
dna and protein sequences and corresponding annotations for t. aestivum and  <dig> other plant species were collected from ensembl plants release  <dig> and curated. cliques of predicted 1-to- <dig> orthologs were identified and an annotation enrichment model was defined based on existing gene-go term associations and phylogenetic relationships among wheat and  <dig> other plant species. a total of  <dig> cliques of size  <dig> were identified, which represent putative functionally equivalent genes and proteins in the  <dig> plant species. eighty-five new and more specific go terms were associated with wheat genes in the  <dig> cliques of size  <dig>  which represent a 65% increase compared with the previously  <dig> known go terms. similar expression patterns for  <dig> genes from arabidopsis, barley, maize and rice in cliques of size  <dig> provide experimental evidence to support our model. overall, based on clique size equal or larger than  <dig>  our model enriched the existing gene-go term associations for  <dig>   wheat genes, of which  <dig>  had no previous annotation.


CONCLUSIONS
our novel comparative genomics approach enriches existing t. aestivum gene annotations based on cliques of predicted 1-to- <dig> orthologs, phylogenetic relationships and existing gene ontologies from  <dig> other plant species.
