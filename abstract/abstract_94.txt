BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major pathogen associated with chronic and ultimately fatal lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis . to investigate how p. aeruginosa-derived vesicles may contribute to lung disease, we explored their ability to associate with human lung cells.


RESULTS
purified vesicles associated with lung cells and were internalized in a time- and dose-dependent manner. vesicles from a cf isolate exhibited a 3- to 4-fold greater association with lung cells than vesicles from the lab strain pao <dig>  vesicle internalization was temperature-dependent and was inhibited by hypertonic sucrose and cyclodextrins. surface-bound vesicles rarely colocalized with clathrin. internalized vesicles colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum  marker, trapÎ±, as well as with er-localized pools of cholera toxin and transferrin. cf isolates of p. aeruginosa abundantly secrete paap , an aminopeptidase that associates with the surface of vesicles. vesicles from a paap knockout strain exhibited a 40% decrease in cell association. likewise, vesicles from pao <dig> overexpressing paap displayed a significant increase in cell association.


CONCLUSIONS
these data reveal that paap promotes the association of vesicles with lung cells. taken together, these results suggest that p. aeruginosa vesicles can interact with and be internalized by lung epithelial cells and contribute to the inflammatory response during infection.
