BACKGROUND
brassica rapa is an economically important crop and a model plant for studies concerning polyploidization and the evolution of extreme morphology. the multinational b. rapa genome sequencing project  was launched in  <dig>  in  <dig>  next generation sequencing technology was used to sequence the b. rapa genome. several maps concerning b. rapa pseudochromosome assembly have been published but their coverage of the genome is incomplete, anchoring approximately  <dig> % of the scaffolds on to chromosomes. therefore, a new genetic map to aid pseudochromosome assembly is required.


RESULTS
this study concerns the construction of a reference genetic linkage map for brassica rapa, forming the backbone for anchoring sequence scaffolds of the b. rapa genome resulting from recent sequencing efforts. one hundred and nineteen doubled haploid  lines derived from microspore cultures of an f <dig> cross between a chinese cabbage  dh line  and a rapid cycling inbred line  were used to construct the linkage map. pcr-based insertion/deletion  markers were developed by re-sequencing the two parental lines. the map comprises a total of  <dig> markers including  <dig> indels and  <dig> ssrs. alignment and orientation using ssr markers in common with existing b. rapa linkage maps allowed ten linkage groups to be identified, designated a01-a <dig>  the total length of the linkage map was  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent marker loci. the lengths of linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm for a <dig> and a <dig>  respectively. using the developed linkage map,  <dig> scaffolds were anchored on to the chromosomes, encompassing more than  <dig> % of the b. rapa genome. taken together with the previously available linkage maps,  <dig> scaffolds were anchored on to the chromosomes and the total coverage of the genome was  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
the development of this linkage map is vital for the integration of genome sequences and genetic information, and provides a useful resource for the international brassica research community.
