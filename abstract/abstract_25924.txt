BACKGROUND
recent genome-wide association studies searching for candidate susceptibility loci for common complex diseases such as type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  and its common complications have uncovered novel disease-associated genes. nevertheless these large-scale population screens often overlook the tremendous variation in the mitochondrial genome  and its involvement in complex disorders.


RESULTS
we have analyzed the mitochondrial dna  genetic variability in ashkenazi , sephardic  and north african  jewish populations . our analysis showed significant differences  in the distribution of mtdna genetic backgrounds  among the studied populations. to test whether these differences alter the pattern of disease susceptibility, we have screened our three jewish populations for an association of mtdna genetic haplogroups with t2dm complications. our results identified population-specific susceptibility factors of which the best example is the ashkenazi jewish specific haplogroup n1b <dig>  having an apparent protective effect against t2dm complications in ash , being absent in the naf population and under-represented in the seph population. we have generated and analyzed whole mtdna sequences from the disease associated haplogroups revealing mutations in highly conserved positions that are good candidates to explain the phenotypic effect of these genetic backgrounds.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings support the possibility that recent bottleneck events leading to over-representation of minor mtdna alleles in specific genetic isolates, could result in population-specific susceptibility loci to complex disorders.
