BACKGROUND
msx <dig> and msx <dig>  which belong to the highly conserved nk family of homeobox genes, display overlapping expression patterns and redundant functions in multiple tissues and organs during vertebrate development. msx <dig> and msx <dig> have well-documented roles in mediating epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis. given that both msx <dig> and msx <dig> are crucial downstream effectors of bmp signaling, we investigated whether msx <dig> and msx <dig> are required for the bmp-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transformation  during atrioventricular  valve formation.


RESULTS
while both msx1-/- and msx2-/- single homozygous mutant mice exhibited normal valve formation, we observed hypoplastic av cushions and malformed av valves in msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutants, indicating redundant functions of msx <dig> and msx <dig> during av valve morphogenesis. in msx1/ <dig> null mutant av cushions, we found decreased bmp2/ <dig> and notch <dig> signaling as well as reduced expression of has <dig>  nfatc <dig> and notch <dig>  demonstrating impaired endocardial activation and emt. moreover, perturbed expression of chamber-specific genes anf, tbx <dig>  hand <dig> and hand <dig> reveals mispatterning of the msx1/ <dig> double mutant myocardium and suggests functions of msx <dig> and msx <dig> in regulating myocardial signals required for remodelling av valves and maintaining an undifferentiated state of the av myocardium.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate redundant roles of msx <dig> and msx <dig> in regulating signals required for development of the av myocardium and formation of the av valves.
