BACKGROUND
chronic inflammation-mediated β-cell apoptosis is known to decrease β-cell mass in diabetes leading to reduced insulin secretion. exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines can stimulate apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. the g protein coupled receptor  <dig>  is implicated for glucose induced insulin secretion. we hypothesized that gpr <dig> activation can protect β-cells from inflammation-induced apoptosis and restore glucose stimulated insulin secretion.


RESULTS
by exposing nit <dig> insulinoma cells and rat islets to a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines , we mimicked inflammatory signaling as seen by jnk and nfκb activation and increased mrna levels of tnfα, il1β and nos2a. these changes were reversed by pharmacological activation of gpr <dig> by a specific, small molecule, cnx-011- <dig>  further, gpr <dig> activation reduced inflammation-mediated oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum  stresses. importantly, gpr <dig> activation decreased inflammation-induced apoptosis as measured by key markers. these impacts of gpr <dig> were mediated through activation of plc, camkii, calcineurin and camp. cell survival was also enhanced by gpr <dig> activation as seen from the increased phosphorylation of akt/pkb and enhanced expression of bcl <dig> and pdx <dig> genes. interestingly, gpr <dig> activation restored both, inflammation-mediated inhibition on insulin secretion and intracellular insulin content.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we provide evidences that cnx-011- <dig>  a gpr <dig> agonist, reduces inflammatory signaling and apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells while promoting insulin secretion and synthesis. activation of gpr <dig> leads to attenuation of β-cell dysfunction caused by chronic inflammation and thus could be of immense clinical value to improve insulin secretion and β-cell survival.
