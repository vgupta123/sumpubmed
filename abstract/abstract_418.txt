BACKGROUND
alterations in gene expression are key events in disease etiology and risk. poor reproducibility in detecting differentially expressed genes across studies suggests individual genes may not be sufficiently informative for complex diseases, such as myocardial infarction . rather, dysregulation of the ‘molecular network’ may be critical for pathogenic processes. such a dynamic network can be built from pairwise non-linear interactions.


RESULTS
we investigate non-linear interactions represented in mrna expression profiles that integrate genetic background and environmental factors. using logistic regression, we test the association of individual gwas-based candidate genes and non-linear interaction terms  with mi. based on microarray data in cathgen  and fhs , we find individual genes and pairs of mrnas, encoded by  <dig> mi candidate genes, with significant interaction terms in the logistic regression model. two pairs replicate between cathgen and fhs .

analysis of rnaseq data from gtex  shows that 20 % of these disease-associated rna pairs are co-expressed, further prioritizing significant interactions. because edges in sparse co-expression networks formed solely by the  <dig> candidate genes are unlikely to represent direct physical interactions, we identify additional rnas as links between network pairs of candidate genes. this approach reveals additional mrnas and interaction terms significant in the context of mi, for example, the path cnnm2|acsl5|scarf1|gucy1a <dig>  characterized by the common themes of magnesium and lipid processing.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study support a role for non-linear interactions between genes in mi and provide a basis for further study of mi systems biology. mrna expression profiles encoded by a limited number of candidate genes yield sparse networks of mi-relevant interactions that can be expanded to include additional candidates by co-expression analysis. the non-linear interactions observed here inform our understanding of the clinical relevance of gene-gene interactions in the pathophysiology of mi, while providing a new strategy in developing clinical biomarker panels.
