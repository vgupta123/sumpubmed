BACKGROUND
sakha – an area connecting south and northeast siberia – is significant for understanding the history of peopling of northeast eurasia and the americas. previous studies have shown a genetic contiguity between siberia and east asia and the key role of south siberia in the colonization of siberia.


RESULTS
we report the results of a high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> mtdnas and  <dig> y chromosomes from five native populations of sakha  and of the analysis of more than  <dig>  autosomal snps of  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations, including  <dig> previously unpublished samples from siberia. phylogenetically terminal clades of east asian mtdna haplogroups c and d and y-chromosome haplogroups n1c, n1b and c <dig>  constituting the core of the gene pool of the native populations from sakha, connect sakha and south siberia. analysis of autosomal snp data confirms the genetic continuity between sakha and south siberia. maternal lineages d5a2a <dig>  c4a1c, c4a <dig>  c5b1b and the yakut-specific str sub-clade of y-chromosome haplogroup n1c can be linked to a migration of yakut ancestors, while the paternal lineage c3c was most likely carried to sakha by the expansion of the tungusic people. mtdna haplogroups z1a1b and z1a <dig>  present in yukaghirs, evens and dolgans, show traces of different and probably more ancient migration. analysis of both haploid loci and autosomal snp data revealed only minor genetic components shared between sakha and the extreme northeast siberia. although the major part of west eurasian maternal and paternal lineages in sakha could originate from recent admixture with east europeans, mtdna haplogroups h <dig>  h20a and hv1a1a, as well as y-chromosome haplogroup j, more probably reflect an ancient gene flow from west eurasia through central asia and south siberia.


CONCLUSIONS
our high-resolution phylogenetic dissection of mtdna and y-chromosome haplogroups as well as analysis of autosomal snp data suggests that sakha was colonized by repeated expansions from south siberia with minor gene flow from the lower amur/southern okhotsk region and/or kamchatka. the minor west eurasian component in sakha attests to both recent and ongoing admixture with east europeans and an ancient gene flow from west eurasia.
