BACKGROUND
insect cuticle plays essential roles in many physiological functions. during molting and metamorphosis tremendous changes occur in silkworm cuticle where multiple proteins exist and genes encoding them constitute about  <dig> % of all bombyx mori genes.


RESULTS
in an effort to determine their expression profiles, a microarray-based investigation was carried out using mrna collected from larvae to pupae. the results showed that a total of  <dig> genes involved in various functions and physiological pathways were activated. the vast majority  of cuticular protein genes were expressed in selected stages with varying expression patterns. there was no correlation between expression patterns and the presence of conserved motifs. twenty-six rr genes distributed in chromosome  <dig> were co-expressed at the larval and wandering stages. the  <dig> kb upstream regions of these genes were further analyzed and three putative elements were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
data from the present study provide, for the first time, a comprehensive expression profile of genes in silkworm epidermal tissues and evidence that putative elements exist to allow massive production of mrnas from specific cuticular protein genes.
