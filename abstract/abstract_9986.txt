BACKGROUND
phylogenomic analyses recently became popular to address questions about deep metazoan phylogeny. ribosomal proteins  dominate many of these analyses or are, in some cases, the only genes included. despite initial hopes, phylogenomic analyses including tens to hundreds of genes still fail to robustly place many bilaterian taxa.


RESULTS
using the phylogenetic position of myzostomids as an example, we show that phylogenies derived from rp genes and mitochondrial genes produce incongruent results. whereas the former support a position within a clade of platyzoan taxa, mitochondrial data recovers an annelid affinity, which is strongly supported by the gene order data and is congruent with morphology. using hypothesis testing, our rp data significantly rejects the annelids affinity, whereas a platyzoan relationship is significantly rejected by the mitochondrial data.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude  that reliance of a set of markers belonging to a single class of macromolecular complexes might bias the analysis, and  that concatenation of all available data might introduce conflicting signal into phylogenetic analyses. we therefore strongly recommend testing for data incongruence in phylogenomic analyses. furthermore, judging all available data, we consider the annelid affinity hypothesis more plausible than a possible platyzoan affinity for myzostomids, and suspect long branch attraction is influencing the rp data. however, this hypothesis needs further confirmation by future analyses.
