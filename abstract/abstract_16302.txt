BACKGROUND
the chicken avidin gene family consists of avidin and several avidin related genes . of these gene products, avidin is the best characterized and is known for its extremely high affinity for d-biotin, a property that is utilized in numerous modern life science applications. recently, the avr genes have been expressed as recombinant proteins, which have shown different biotin-binding properties as compared to avidin.


RESULTS
in the present study, we have employed multiple biochemical methods to better understand the structure-function relationship of avr proteins focusing on avr <dig>  firstly, we have solved the high-resolution crystal structure of avr <dig> in complex with a bound ligand, d-biotin. the avr <dig> structure reveals an overall fold similar to the previously determined structures of avidin and avr <dig>  major differences are seen, especially at the 1â€“ <dig> subunit interface, which is stabilized mainly by polar interactions in the case of avr <dig> but by hydrophobic interactions in the case of avr <dig> and avidin, and in the vicinity of the biotin binding pocket. secondly, mutagenesis, competitive dissociation analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to compare and study the biotin-binding properties as well as the thermal stability of avrs and avidin. these analyses pinpointed the importance of residue  <dig> for biotin binding and stability of avrs. the i109k mutation increased the biotin-binding affinity of avr <dig>  whereas the k109i mutation decreased the biotin-binding affinity of avr <dig>  furthermore, the thermal stability of avr <dig> increased in comparison to the wild-type protein and the k109i mutation led to a decrease in the thermal stability of avr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, this study broadens our understanding of the structural features determining the ligand-binding affinities and stability as well as the molecular evolution within the protein family. this novel information can be applied to further develop and improve the tools already widely used in avidin-biotin technology.
