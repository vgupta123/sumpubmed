BACKGROUND
neuroinflammation, caused by six days of intracerebroventricular infusion of bacterial lipopolysaccharide , stimulates rat brain arachidonic acid  metabolism. the molecular changes associated with increased aa metabolism are not clear. we examined effects of a six-day infusion of a low-dose  and a high-dose  of lps on neuroinflammatory, aa cascade, and pre- and post-synaptic markers in rat brain. we used artificial cerebrospinal fluid-infused brains as controls.


RESULTS
infusion of low- or high-dose lps increased brain protein levels of tnfα, and inos, without significantly changing gfap. high-dose lps infusion upregulated brain protein and mrna levels of aa cascade markers , and of transcription factor nf-κb p <dig> dna binding activity. both lps doses increased cpla <dig> and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase levels, while reducing protein levels of the pre-synaptic marker, synaptophysin. post-synaptic markers drebrin and psd <dig> protein levels were decreased with high- but not low-dose lps.


CONCLUSIONS
chronic lps infusion has differential effects, depending on dose, on inflammatory, aa and synaptic markers in rat brain. neuroinflammation associated with upregulated brain aa metabolism can lead to synaptic dysfunction.
