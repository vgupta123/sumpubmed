BACKGROUND
hi-c analysis has revealed the three-dimensional architecture of chromosomes in the nucleus. although hi-c data contains valuable information on long-range interactions of chromosomes, the data is not yet widely utilized by molecular biologists because of the quantity of data.


RESULTS
we developed a web tool, chromcontact, to utilize the information obtained by hi-c. the web tool is designed to be simple and easy to use. by specifying a locus of interest, chromcontact calculates contact profiles and generates links to the ucsc genome browser, enabling users to visually examine the contact information with various annotations.


CONCLUSIONS
chromcontact provides wide-range of molecular biologists with a user-friendly means to access high-resolution hi-c data. one of the possible applications of chromcontact is investigating novel long-range promoter-enhancer interactions. this facilitates the functional interpretation of statistically significant markers identified by gwas or chip-seq peaks that are located far from any annotated genes. chromcontact is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.sls.kyushu-u.ac.jp/chromcontact/.
