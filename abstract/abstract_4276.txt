BACKGROUND
β-amyloid  accumulation is described as a hallmark of alzheimer’s disease . aβ perturbs a number of synaptic components including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing α <dig> subunits , which are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus and found on gabaergic interneurons. we have previously demonstrated the existence of a novel, heteromeric α7β2-nachr in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that exhibits high sensitivity to acute aβ exposure. to extend our previous work, we evaluated the expression and pharmacology of α7β2-nachrs in hippocampal interneurons and their sensitivity to aβ.


RESULTS
gabaergic interneurons in the ca <dig> subregion of the hippocampus expressed functional α7β2-nachrs, which were characterized by relatively slow whole-cell current kinetics, pharmacological sensitivity to dihydro-β-erythroidine , a nachr β2* subunit selective blocker, and α <dig> and β <dig> subunit interaction using immunoprecipitation assay. in addition, α7β2-nachrs were sensitive to  <dig> nm oligomeric aβ. similar effects were observed in identified hippocampal interneurons prepared from gfp-gad mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that aβ modulation of cholinergic signaling in hippocampal gabaergic interneurons via α7β2-nachrs could be an early and critical event in aβ-induced functional abnormalities of hippocampal function, which may be relevant to learning and memory deficits in ad.
