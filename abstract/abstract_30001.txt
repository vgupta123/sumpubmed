BACKGROUND
chlamydia trachomatis infection results in reproductive damage in some women. the process and factors involved in this immunopathology are not well understood. this study aimed to investigate the role of primary human cellular responses to chlamydial stress response proteases and chlamydial infection to further identify the immune processes involved in serious disease sequelae.


RESULTS
laboratory cell cultures and primary human reproductive epithelial cultures produced il- <dig> in response to chlamydial stress response proteases , uv inactivated chlamydia, and live chlamydia. the magnitude of the il- <dig> response varied considerably  across different primary human reproductive cultures. thus different levels of il- <dig> production by reproductive epithelia may be a determinant in disease outcome. interestingly, co-culture models with either thp- <dig> cells or autologous primary human pbmc generally resulted in increased levels of il- <dig>  except in the case of live chlamydia where the level of il- <dig> was decreased compared to the epithelial cell culture only, suggesting this pathway may be able to be modulated by live chlamydia. pbmc responses to the stress response proteases  did not significantly vary for the different participant cohorts. therefore, these proteases may possess conserved innate pamps. map kinases appeared to be involved in this il- <dig> induction from human cells. finally, we also demonstrated that il- <dig> was induced by these proteins and chlamydia from mouse primary reproductive cell cultures  and mouse laboratory cell models.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that il- <dig> may be a key factor for the chlamydial disease outcome in humans, given that primary human reproductive epithelial cell culture showed considerable variation in il- <dig> response to chlamydia or chlamydial proteins, and that the presence of live chlamydia  during co-culture resulted in a reduced il- <dig> response suggesting this response may be moderated by the presence of the organism.
