BACKGROUND
the thymidine kinase  mutants generated from the widely used l5178y mouse lymphoma assay fall into two categories, small colony and large colony. cells from the large colonies grow at a normal rate while cells from the small colonies grow slower than normal. the relative proportion of large and small colonies after mutagen treatment is associated with a mutagen's ability to induce point mutations and/or chromosomal mutations. the molecular distinction between large and small colony mutants, however, is not clear.


RESULTS
to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for the mutant colony phenotype, microarray gene expression analysis was carried out on  <dig> small and  <dig> large colony tk mutant samples. nctr-fabricated long-oligonucleotide microarrays of  <dig>  mouse genes were used in a two-color reference design experiment. the data were analyzed within arraytrack software that was developed at the nctr. principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles showed that the samples were clearly separated into two groups based on their colony size phenotypes. the welch t-test was used for determining significant changes in gene expression between the large and small colony groups and  <dig> genes whose expression was significantly altered were identified . using ingenuity pathways analysis ,  <dig> out of the  <dig> significant genes were found in the ipa database and mapped to four networks associated with cell growth. eleven percent of the  <dig> significant genes were located on chromosome  <dig> where the tk gene resides while only  <dig> % of the genes on the microarrays mapped to chromosome  <dig>  all of the chromosome  <dig> significant genes were expressed at a higher level in the small colony mutants compared to the large colony mutants. also, most of the significant genes located on chromosome  <dig> were disproportionally concentrated on the distal end of chromosome  <dig> where the tk mutations occurred.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that microarray analysis can define cellular phenotypes and identify genes that are related to the colony size phenotypes. the findings suggest that genes in the dna segment altered by the tk mutations were significantly up-regulated in the small colony mutants, but not in the large colony mutants, leading to differential expression of a set of growth regulation genes that are related to cell apoptosis and other cellular functions related to the restriction of cell growth.
