BACKGROUND
massively-parallel cdna sequencing  is a new technique that holds great promise for cardiovascular genomics. here, we used rna-seq to study the transcriptomes of matched coronary artery disease cases and controls in the clinseqÂ® study, using cell lines as tissue surrogates.


RESULTS
lymphoblastoid cell lines  from  <dig> cases and controls representing phenotypic extremes for coronary calcification were cultured and analyzed using rna-seq. all cell lines were then independently re-cultured and along with another set of  <dig> independent cases and controls, were profiled with affymetrix microarrays to perform a technical validation of the rna-seq results. statistically significant changes  were detected in  <dig> transcripts, many of which are expressed at extremely low levels , which we confirmed through a separate spike-in control rna-seq experiment. next, by fitting a linear model to exon-level rna-seq read counts, we detected signals of alternative splicing in  <dig> transcripts. finally, we used the rna-seq data to identify differential expression  in eight previously unannotated regions that may represent novel transcripts. overall, differentially expressed genes showed strong enrichment  for prior association with cardiovascular disease. at the network level, we found evidence for perturbation in pathways involving both cardiovascular system development and function as well as lipid metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a pilot study for transcriptome involvement in coronary artery calcification and demonstrate how rna-seq analyses using lcls as a tissue surrogate may yield fruitful results in a clinical sequencing project. in addition to canonical gene expression, we present candidate variants from alternative splicing and novel transcript detection, which have been unexplored in the context of this disease.
