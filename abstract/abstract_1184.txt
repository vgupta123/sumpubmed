BACKGROUND
activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule  is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells. however, its role in hematopoietic differentiation has not previously been defined.


RESULTS
in this study, we show that alcam expression is silenced in erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cell lines. in agreement with this finding, the alcam promoter is occupied by gata- <dig> in vivo, and a cognate motif at - <dig> inhibited promoter activity in k <dig> and meg- <dig> cells. gain-of-function studies showed that alcam clusters k <dig> cells in a process that requires pkc. induction of megakaryocytic differentiation in k <dig> clones expressing alcam activated pkc-Î´ and triggered apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
there is a lineage-specific silencing of alcam in bi-potential erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cell lines. marked apoptosis of alcam-expressing k <dig> clones treated with pma suggests that aberrant alcam expression in erythromegakaryocytic progenitors may contribute to megakaryocytopenia.
