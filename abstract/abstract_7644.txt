BACKGROUND
most microarray experiments are carried out with the purpose of identifying genes whose expression varies in relation with specific conditions or in response to environmental stimuli. in such studies, genes showing similar mean expression values between two or more groups are considered as not differentially expressed, even if hidden subclasses with different expression values may exist. in this paper we propose a new method for identifying differentially expressed genes, based on the area between the roc curve and the rising diagonal . abcr represents a more general approach than the standard area under the roc curve , because it can identify both proper  and not proper roc curves . in particular, nprc may correspond to those genes that tend to escape standard selection methods.


RESULTS
we assessed the performance of our method using data from a publicly available database of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> normal b cell samples  and  <dig> heterogeneous lymphomas . moreover, nbc also included two sub-classes, i.e.,  <dig> heavily stimulated and  <dig> slightly or not stimulated samples. we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes with an estimated false discovery rate of 15%. among them,  <dig> corresponded to nprc and all escaped standard selection procedures based on auc and t statistics. moreover, a simple inspection to the shape of such plots allowed to identify the two subclasses in either one class in  <dig> cases .


CONCLUSIONS
nprc represent a new useful tool for the analysis of microarray data.
