BACKGROUND
commercial bacterins are widely used at weaning to control mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections in pigs. however, it is not known whether the efficacy of vaccinating against m. hyopneumoniae can be influenced by the weaning process when vaccination is applied at the day of weaning. the present study assessed the efficacy of a single m. hyopneumoniae vaccination  three days before weaning  or at weaning  against experimental challenge infection. four weeks after vaccination, groups v <dig> and v <dig>  and a non-vaccinated, positive control group   were endotracheally inoculated with a virulent m. hyopneumoniae field strain. five pigs were used as a negative control group. all pigs were euthanized 5 weeks after challenge. the main parameters investigated included macroscopic and histopathological lung lesions at necropsy, immunofluorescence  staining and quantitative real-time pcr  on broncho-alveolar lavage  fluid for quantifying m. hyopneumoniae.


RESULTS
the average macroscopic lung lesion scores in groups v <dig>  v <dig> and pcg were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the average lymphohistiocytic infiltration scores in groups v <dig>  v <dig> and pcg were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the average if scores were: v1 =  <dig> , v2 =  <dig>  and pcg =  <dig>  , the qpcr values were: v1 =  <dig> , v2 =  <dig>  and pcg =  <dig>  . all pigs of the negative control group remained negative throughout the study.


CONCLUSIONS
both vaccinated groups had lower numbers of macroscopic and histopathological lung lesions, and lower numbers of m. hyopneumoniae organisms in the bal fluid compared to the pcg. however, no firm conclusions could be made on whether weaning negatively influences the efficacy of m. hyopneumoniae vaccination, since significant differences between the treatment groups were only obtained for the histopathological lung lesions. this could be attributed to the fact that milder macroscopic lung lesions were produced in the inoculated pigs, when compared to previous trials conducted by the same group. further research under field conditions is warranted to assess possible differences between the two vaccination strategies.
