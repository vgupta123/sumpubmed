BACKGROUND
retrotransposons have been known to involve in the remodeling and evolution of host genome. these reverse transcribing elements, which show a complex evolutionary pathway with diverse intermediate forms, have been comprehensively analyzed from a wide range of host genomes, while the information remains limited to only a few species in the phylum platyhelminthes.


RESULTS
a ltr retrotransposon and its homologs with a strong phylogenetic affinity toward csrn <dig> of clonorchis sinensis were isolated from a trematode parasite paragonimus westermani via a degenerate pcr method and from an insect species anopheles gambiae by in silico analysis of the whole mosquito genome, respectively. these elements, designated pwrn <dig> and agcr- <dig> â€“ agcr- <dig> conserved unique features including a t-rnatrp primer binding site and the unusual chcc signature of gag proteins. their flanking ltrs displayed >97% nucleotide identities and thus, these elements were likely to have expanded recently in the trematode and insect genomes. they evolved heterogeneous expression strategies: a single fused orf, two separate orfs with an identical reading frame and two orfs overlapped by - <dig> frameshifting. phylogenetic analyses suggested that the elements with the separate orfs had evolved from an ancestral form with the overlapped orfs. the mobile potential of pwrn <dig> was likely to be maintained differentially in association with the karyotype of host genomes, as was examined by the presence/absence of intergenomic polymorphism and mrna transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
our results on the structural diversity of csrn1-like elements can provide a molecular tool to dissect a more detailed evolutionary episode of ltr retrotransposons. the pwrn1-associated genomic polymorphism, which is substantial in diploids, will also be informative in addressing genomic diversification following inter-/intra-specific hybridization in p. westermani populations.
