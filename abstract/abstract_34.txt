BACKGROUND
although the importance of the human oral microbiome for health and disease is increasingly recognized, variation in the composition of the oral microbiome across different climates and geographic regions is largely unexplored.


RESULTS
here we analyze the saliva microbiome from native alaskans , germans , and africans  based on next-generation sequencing of partial 16s rrna gene sequences. after quality filtering, a total of  <dig>  analyzed sequences resulted in  <dig>  otus  and  <dig> genera. the three human groups differed significantly by the degree of diversity between and within individuals . unifrac, network, anosim, and correlation analyses all indicated more similarities in the saliva microbiome of native alaskans and germans than between either group and africans. the native alaskans and germans also had the highest number of shared bacterial interactions. at the level of shared otus, only limited support for a core microbiome shared across all three continental regions was provided, although partial correlation analysis did highlight interactions involving several pairs of genera as conserved across all human groups. subsampling strategies for compensating for the unequal number of individuals per group or unequal sequence reads confirmed the above observations.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, this study illustrates the distinctiveness of the saliva microbiome of human groups living under very different climatic conditions.
