BACKGROUND
the rho-associated coiled-coil kinase- <dig>  is an important signaling transducer in the transmission of extracellular signals effecting organization of the actin cytoskeleton. rock <dig> has been implicated in numerous pathologies and the current focus is on understanding the molecular events that couple rock <dig> activity to biological function. to aid in the search for new rock <dig> substrates, we have developed an analog-sensitive  rock <dig> protein that allows the use of selective atp analogs that are not efficiently utilized by other protein kinases.


RESULTS
the analog sensitive protein, m160a rock <dig>  was highly active and could phosphorylate proteins from a cellular homogenate with 
γ
32p-n <dig> atp. we show the utility of this approach by identifying a putative rock <dig> substrate, elongation initiation factor-1-α <dig>  we further show that the major site of rock <dig> phosphorylation of eif1α <dig> is thr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates that as-rock <dig> could be useful in a systematic proteomic approach for identifying novel rock <dig> substrates.
