BACKGROUND
real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr  data needs to be normalized for its proper interpretation. housekeeping genes are routinely employed for this purpose, but their expression level cannot be assumed to remain constant under all possible experimental conditions. thus, a systematic validation of reference genes is required to ensure proper normalization. for soybean, only a small number of validated reference genes are available to date.


RESULTS
a systematic comparison of  <dig> potential reference genes for soybean is presented. these included seven commonly used  and seven new candidates . expression stability was examined by rt-qpcr across  <dig> biological samples, representing tissues at various developmental stages, varied photoperiodic treatments, and a range of soybean cultivars. expression of all  <dig> genes was variable to some extent, but that of skip <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> was overall the most stable. a combination of act <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> would be appropriate as a reference panel for normalizing gene expression data among different tissues, whereas the combination skip <dig>  ukn <dig> and mtp was most suitable for developmental stages. act <dig>  tua <dig> and tip <dig> were the most stably expressed when the photoperiod was altered, and tip <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> when the light quality was changed. for six different cultivars in long day  and short day , their expression stability did not vary significantly with act <dig>  ukn <dig> and tub <dig> being the most stable genes. the relative gene expression level of gmftl <dig>  an ortholog of arabidopsis ft  was detected to validate the reference genes selected in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
none of the candidate reference genes was uniformly expressed across all experimental conditions, and the most suitable reference genes are conditional-, tissue-specific-, developmental-, and cultivar-dependent. most of the new reference genes performed better than the conventional housekeeping genes. these results should guide the selection of reference genes for gene expression studies in soybean.
