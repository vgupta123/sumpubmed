BACKGROUND
histone deacetylase- <dig>  is a class ii histone deacetylase that inhibits the activity of transcription factors. in humans, hdac <dig> deficiency is associated with non-syndromic oral clefts and brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome  with craniofacial abnormalities.


RESULTS
we identify hdac <dig> in zebrafish and characterize its function in craniofacial morphogenesis. the gene is present as a single copy, and the deduced hdac <dig> protein sequence shares all known functional domains with human hdac <dig>  the zebrafish hdac <dig> transcript is widely present in migratory cranial neural crest  cells of the embryo, including populations migrating around the eye, which previously have been shown to contribute to the formation of the palatal skeleton of the early larva. embryos injected with hdac <dig> morpholinos  have reduced or absent cnc populations that normally migrate medial to the eye. cnc-derived palatal precursor cells do not recover at the post-migratory stage, and subsequently we found that defects in the developing cartilaginous palatal skeleton correlate with reduction or absence of early cnc cells. palatal skeletal defects prominently include a shortened, clefted, or missing ethmoid plate, and are associated with a shortening of the face of young larvae.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that hdac <dig> is a regulator of cnc-derived palatal skeletal precursors during early embryogenesis. cleft palate resulting from hdac <dig> mutations in human patients may result from defects in a homologous cnc progenitor cell population.
