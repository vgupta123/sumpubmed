BACKGROUND
ifnγ-producing cd4+cd25+foxp3+ pbl represent a subtype of itreg that are associated with good long-term graft outcome in renal transplant recipients and suppress alloresponses in-vitro. to study the mechanism of immunosuppression, we attempted to block cell surface receptors and thereby inhibited the function of this itreg subset in-vitro using monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins.

methods
pbl of healthy control individuals were stimulated polyclonally in-vitro in the presence of monoclonal antibodies or recombinant proteins against/of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and hla-dr. induction of ifnγ+ itreg and proliferation of effector cells was determined using four-color fluorescence flow cytometry. blockade of itreg function was analyzed using polyclonally stimulated co-cultures with separated cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ pbl.


RESULTS
high monoclonal antibody concentrations inhibited the induction of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ifnγ+ pbl  and cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ pbl . effector cell proliferation increased with increasing antibody concentrations in culture medium . conversely, high concentrations of recombinant proteins induced formation of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ifnγ+ pbl  and decreased cell proliferation dose-dependently . our data suggest an inverse association of itreg induction with effector cell proliferation in cell culture which is dependent on the concentration of monoclonal antibodies against itreg surface determinants. 3-day co-cultures of polyclonally stimulated pbl with separated cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ pbl showed lower cell proliferation than co-cultures with cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- pbl . cell proliferation increased strongly in cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- pbl-containing co-cultures in the presence of monoclonal antibody  but remained low in co-cultures with cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ pbl . monoclonal antibodies prevent itreg induction in co-cultures with cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- pbl but do not efficiently block suppressive itreg function in co-cultures with cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ pbl.


CONCLUSIONS
cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and hla-dr determinants are important for induction and suppressive function of ifnγ+ itreg.
