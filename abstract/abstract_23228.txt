BACKGROUND
the xenopus oocyte is a useful cell model to study ca2+ homeostasis and cell cycle regulation, two highly interrelated processes. here, we used antisense oligonucleotides to investigate the role in the oocyte of stromal interaction molecule  proteins that are fundamental elements of the store-operated calcium-entry  phenomenon, as they are both sensors for ca2+ concentration in the intracellular reservoirs as well as activators of the membrane channels that allow ca2+ influx.


RESULTS
endogenous stim <dig> and stim <dig> expression was demonstrated, and their synthesis was knocked down 48–72 h after injecting oocytes with specific antisense sequences. selective elimination of their mrna and protein expression was confirmed by pcr and western blot analysis, and we then evaluated the effect of their absence on two endogenous responses: the opening of soc channels elicited by g protein-coupled receptor -activated ca2+ release, and the process of maturation stimulated by progesterone. activation of soc channels was monitored electrically by measuring the tin response, a ca2+-influx-dependent cl− current, while maturation was assessed by germinal vesicle breakdown  scoring and electrophysiology.


CONCLUSIONS
it was found that stim <dig>  but not stim <dig>  was essential in both responses, and tin currents and gvbd were strongly reduced or eliminated in cells devoid of stim2; stim <dig> knockdown had no effect on the maturation process, but it reduced the tin response by  <dig> to 70%. thus, the endogenous soce response in xenopus oocytes depended mainly on stim <dig>  and its expression was necessary for entry into meiosis induced by progesterone.
