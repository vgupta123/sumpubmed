BACKGROUND
cd <dig> t lymphocyte activation requires t cell receptor  engagement by peptide/mhc  . the tcr complementarity-determining region  <dig>  contains variable α and β loops critical for pmhc recognition. during any immune response, tuning of tcr usage through progressive clonal selection occurs. th <dig> and th <dig> cells operate at different avidities for activation and display distinct transcriptional programs, although polarization may be plastic, influenced by pathogens and cytokines. we therefore hypothesized that cdr3αβ sequence features may intrinsically influence cd <dig> phenotype during progression of a response.


RESULTS
we show that cd <dig> polarization involves distinct cdr3α usage: th <dig> and th <dig> cells favored short tcr cdr3α sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, while th <dig> cells favored elongated cdr3α loops of  <dig> amino acids, with lower predicted affinity. the dominant th2- and th1-derived tcrα sequences with <dig> amino acid cdr <dig> loops and  <dig> amino acid cdr <dig> loops, respectively, were expressed in tcr transgenics. the functional impact of these tcrα transgenes was assessed after in vivo priming with a peptide/adjuvant. the short, th1-derived receptor transgenic t cell lines made ifnγ, but not il- <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  while the elongated, th2-derived receptor transgenic t cell lines made little or no ifnγ, but increased il- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with progressive re-stimulations, mirrored by gata- <dig> up-regulation. t cells from primed th <dig> tcrα transgenics selected dominant tcr vβ expansions, allowing us to generate tcrαβ transgenics carrying the favored, th2-derived receptor heterodimer. primed t cells from tcrαβ transgenics made little or no il- <dig> or ifnγ, but favored il- <dig> after priming with complete freund’s adjuvant and il- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after priming with incomplete freund’s. in tetramer-binding studies, this transgenic receptor showed low binding avidity for pmhc and polarized t cell lines show tcr avidity for th17 > th1 > th <dig>  while transgenic expression of a th2-derived, ‘elongated’ tcr-cdr3α and the tcrαβ pair, clearly generated a program shifted away from th <dig> immunity and with low binding avidity, cytokine-skewing could be over-ridden by altering peptide challenge dose.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that selection from responding clones with distinctive tcrs on the basis of functional avidity can direct a preference away from th <dig> effector responses, favoring th <dig> cytokines.
