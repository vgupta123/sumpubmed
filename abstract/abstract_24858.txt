BACKGROUND
contusive spinal cord injury is complicated by a delayed loss of oligodendrocytes, resulting in chronic progressive demyelination. therefore, transplantation strategies to provide oligodendrocyte lineage cells and to enhance the extent of myelination appear to be justified for spinal cord repair. the present study investigated whether transplantation of human neural stem cells  genetically modified to express olig <dig> transcription factor, an essential regulator of oligodendrocyte development, can improve locomotor recovery and enhance myelination in a rat contusive spinal cord injury model.


RESULTS
hb <dig> f <dig>  immortalized human nsc line was transduced with a retroviral vector encoding olig <dig>  an essential regulator of oligodendrocyte development. overexpression of olig <dig> in human nscs  induced activation of nkx <dig>  and directed differentiation of nscs into oligodendrocyte lineage cells in vitro. introduction of olig <dig> conferred higher proliferative activity, and a much larger number of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs were detected by  <dig> weeks after transplantation into contused spinal cord than that of parental f <dig> nscs. f <dig> olig <dig> nscs exhibited frequent migration towards the white matter, whereas f <dig> nscs were mostly confined to the gray matter or around the lesion cavities. most of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs occupying the spared white matter differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes. transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs increased the volume of spared white matter and reduced the cavity volume. moreover, f <dig> olig <dig> grafts significantly increased the thickness of myelin sheath around the axons in the spared white matter. finally, animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts showed an improvement in the quality of hindlimbs locomotion.


CONCLUSIONS
transplantation of nscs genetically modified to differentiate into an oligodendrocytic lineage may be an effective strategy to improve functional outcomes following spinal cord trauma. the present study suggests that molecular factors governing cell fate decisions can be manipulated to enhance reparative potential of the cell-based therapy.
