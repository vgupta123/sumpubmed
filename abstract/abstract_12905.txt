BACKGROUND
prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer illness and death among men in the united states and world wide. there is an urgent need to discover good biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis and treatment. previously, we developed an exon-junction microarray-based assay and profiled  <dig> mrna splice isoforms from  <dig> potential prostate cancer related genes in  <dig> prostate tissues. here, we investigate the advantage of using splice isoforms, which couple transcriptional and splicing regulation, for cancer classification.


RESULTS
as many as  <dig> splice isoforms from more than  <dig> genes are differentially regulated in tumors at a false discovery rate  of  <dig> . remarkably, about 30% of genes have isoforms that are called significant but do not exhibit differential expression at the overall mrna level. a support vector machine  classifier trained on  <dig> signature isoforms can correctly predict 92% of the cases, which outperforms the classifier using overall mrna abundance by about 5%. it is also observed that the classification performance can be improved using multivariate variable selection methods, which take correlation among variables into account.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that profiling of splice isoforms is able to provide unique and important information which cannot be detected by conventional microarrays.
