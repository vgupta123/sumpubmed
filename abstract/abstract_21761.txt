BACKGROUND
in this study we describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of an outbreak due to carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae  producing ctx-m- <dig> and oxa- <dig> carbapenemase. isogenic strains, carbapenem-susceptible k. pneumoniae  producing ctx-m- <dig>  were also involved in the outbreak.


RESULTS
from october  <dig> to december  <dig> a total of  <dig> cr-kp and  <dig> cs-kp were isolated from clinical samples of  <dig> patients . all patients had underlying diseases and  <dig> of them  had received carbapenems previously. the range of carbapenem mics for total isolates were: imipenem:  <dig> to >32 μg/ml vs. <2 μg/ml; meropenem:  <dig> to >32 μg/ml vs. <2 μg/ml; and ertapenem:  <dig> to >32 μg/ml vs. <2 μg/ml. all the isolates were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole. both types of isolates shared a common pfge pattern associated with the multilocus sequence type  <dig> . the blactx-m- <dig> gene was detected in all the isolates, whereas the blaoxa- <dig> gene was only detected in cr-kp isolates on a 70 kb plasmid.


CONCLUSIONS
the clonal spread of k. pneumoniae st <dig> expressing the oxa- <dig> and ctx-m- <dig> beta-lactamases was the cause of an outbreak of cr-kp infections. ctx-m-15-producing isolates lacking the blaoxa- <dig> gene coexisted during the outbreak.
