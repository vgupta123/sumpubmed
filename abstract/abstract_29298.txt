BACKGROUND
since the early stages of tumorigenesis involve adhesion, escape from immune surveillance, vascularization and angiogenesis, we devised a strategy to study the expression profiles of all publicly known and putative secreted and cell surface genes. we designed a custom oligonucleotide microarray containing probes for  <dig> secreted and cell surface genes to study  <dig> diverse human transformed cell lines and their derivative xenograft tumors. the origins of these human cell lines were lung , breast , colon , ovarian  and prostate  carcinomas.


RESULTS
three different analyses were performed:  a pca-based linear discriminant analysis identified a  <dig> gene profile characteristic of all tumors,  application of manova  to tumor data revealed a larger set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes.  after manova was performed on data from individual tumors, a comparison of differential genes amongst all tumor types revealed  <dig> common differential genes. seven of the  <dig> genes were identified by all three analytical methods. these included late angiogenic, morphogenic and extracellular matrix genes such as angptl <dig>  col1a <dig>  gp <dig>  gpr <dig>  lamb <dig>  pcdhb <dig> and ptger <dig>  the differential expression of angptl <dig> and col1a <dig> and other genes was confirmed by quantitative pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, a comparison of the three analyses revealed an expression pattern indicative of late angiogenic processes. these results show that a xenograft model using multiple cell lines of diverse tissue origin can identify common tumorigenic cell surface or secreted molecules that may be important biomarker and therapeutic discoveries.
