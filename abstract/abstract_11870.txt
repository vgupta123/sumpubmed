BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is associated with a spectrum of symbiotic relationships with its human host from carriage to sepsis and is frequently associated with nosocomial and community-acquired infections, thus the differential gene content among strains is of interest.


RESULTS
we sequenced three clinical strains and combined these data with  <dig> publically available human isolates and one bovine strain for comparative genomic analyses. all genomes were annotated using rast, and then their gene similarities and differences were delineated. gene clustering yielded  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters, of which  <dig>  were core,  <dig> were distributed, and  <dig> were unique. individual genomes contained between  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes. gene-content comparisons among all possible s. aureus strain pairs  revealed a mean difference of  <dig> genes and a maximum difference of  <dig> genes. we developed a revised version of our finite supragenome model to estimate the size of the s. aureus supragenome , and compared it with those of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. there was excellent agreement between rast's annotations and our cds clustering procedure providing for high fidelity metabolomic subsystem analyses to extend our comparative genomic characterization of these strains.


CONCLUSIONS
using a multi-species comparative supragenomic analysis enabled by an improved version of our finite supragenome model we provide data and an interpretation explaining the relatively larger core genome of s. aureus compared to other opportunistic nasopharyngeal pathogens. in addition, we provide independent validation for the efficiency and effectiveness of our orthologous gene clustering algorithm.
