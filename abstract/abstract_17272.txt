BACKGROUND
micrornas, small non-encoding rnas that post-transcriptionally modulate expression of their target genes, have been implicated as critical regulatory molecules in endothelial cells.


RESULTS
in the present study, we found that overexpression of mir-19a protects endothelial cells from lipopolysaccharide -induced apoptosis through the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase  <dig> /p <dig> pathway. quantitative real-time pcr demonstrated that the expression of mir-19a in endothelial cell was markedly down-regulated by lps stimulation. furthermore, lps-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by over-expression of mir-19a. finally, both a luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis showed that ask <dig> is a direct target of mir-19a.


CONCLUSIONS
mir-19a regulates ask <dig> expression by targeting specific binding sites in the 3’ untranslated region of ask <dig> mrna. overexpression of mir-19a is an effective method to protect against lps-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells.
