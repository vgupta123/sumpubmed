BACKGROUND
plexins are a large family of transmembrane receptors for the semaphorins, known for their role in the assembly of neural circuitry. more recently, plexins have been implicated in diverse biological functions, including vascular growth, epithelial tissue morphogenesis and tumour development. in particular, plexinb <dig>  the receptor for sema4d, has been suggested to play a role in neural development and in tumour angiogenesis, based on in vitro studies. however, the tissue distribution of plexinb <dig> has not been extensively studied and the functional relevance of this receptor in vivo still awaits experimental testing. in order to shed light on plexinb <dig> function in vivo, we therefore undertook the genomic targeting of the mouse gene to obtain loss of function mutants.


RESULTS
this study shows that plexinb <dig> receptor and its putative ligand, sema4d, have a selective distribution in nervous and epithelial tissues during development and in the adult. plexinb <dig> and sema4d show largely complementary cell distribution in tissues, consistent with the idea that plexinb <dig> acts as the receptor for sema4d in vivo. interestingly, plexinb <dig> is also expressed in certain tissues in the absence of sema4d, suggesting sema4d independent activities. high expression of plexinb <dig> was found in lung, kidney, liver and cerebellum.

mutant mice lacking expression of semaphorin receptor plexinb <dig> are viable and fertile. although the axon collapsing activity of sema4d is impaired in plexinb <dig> deficient neurons, we could not detect major defects in development, or in adult histology and basic functional parameters of tissues expressing plexinb <dig>  moreover, in the absence of plexinb <dig> the angiogenic response induced by orthotopically implanted tumours was not affected, suggesting that the expression of this semaphorin receptor in endothelial cells is redundant.


CONCLUSIONS
our expression analysis suggests a multifaceted role of plexinb <dig> during mouse development and tissue homeostasis in the adult. nonetheless, the genetic deletion of plexinb <dig> does not result in major developmental defects or clear functional abnormalities. we infer that plexinb <dig> plays a redundant role in mouse development and it is not strictly required for tumour induced angiogenesis.
