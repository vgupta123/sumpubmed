BACKGROUND
granulomatous amoebic encephalitis due to acanthamoeba is often a fatal human disease. however, the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of acanthamoeba encephalitis remain unclear. in this study, the role of extracellular acanthamoeba proteases in central nervous system pathogenesis and pathophysiology was examined.


RESULTS
using an encephalitis isolate belonging to t <dig> genotype, we observed two major proteases with approximate molecular weights of  <dig> kd and  <dig> kd on sds-page gels using gelatin as substrate. the  <dig> kd protease was inhibited with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  suggesting that it is a serine protease, while the  <dig> kd protease was inhibited with  <dig>  10-phenanthroline suggesting that it is a metalloprotease. both proteases exhibited maximal activity at neutral ph and over a range of temperatures, indicating their physiological relevance. these proteases degrade extracellular matrix , which provide structural and functional support to the brain tissue, as shown by the degradation of collagen i and iii , elastin , plasminogen , as well as casein and haemoglobin. the proteases were purified partially using ion-exchange chromatography and their effects were tested in an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier using human brain microvascular endothelial cells . neither the serine nor the metalloprotease exhibited hbmec cytotoxicity. however, the serine protease exhibited hbmec monolayer disruptions  suggesting a role in blood-brain barrier perturbations.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, these data suggest that acanthamoeba proteases digest ecm, which may play crucial role in invasion of the brain tissue by amoebae.
