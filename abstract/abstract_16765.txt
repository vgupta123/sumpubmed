BACKGROUND
the jasmonate-zim domain  repressor family proteins are jasmonate co-receptors and transcriptional repressor in jasmonic acid  signaling pathway, and they play important roles in regulating the growth and development of plants. recently, more and more researches on jaz gene family are reported in many plants. although the genome sequencing of common wheat  and its relatives is complete, our knowledge about this gene family remains vacant.


RESULTS
fourteen jaz genes were identified in the wheat genome. structural analysis revealed that the tajaz proteins in wheat were as conserved as those in other plants, but had structural characteristics. by phylogenetic analysis, all jaz proteins from wheat and other plants were clustered into  <dig> sub-groups , and tajaz proteins shared a high degree of similarity with some jaz proteins from aegliops tauschii, brachypodium distachyon and oryza sativa. the ka/ks ratios of tajaz genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting that the tajaz family had undergone purifying selection in wheat. gene expression patterns obtained by quantitative real-time pcr  revealed differential temporal and spatial regulation of tajaz genes under multifarious abiotic stress treatments of high salinity, drought, cold and phytohormone. among these, tajaz <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were specifically expressed in the anther tissues of the thermosensitive genic male sterile  wheat line bs <dig> and normal control wheat line jing <dig>  compared with the gene expression patterns in the normal wheat line jing <dig>  tajaz <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had different expression patterns in abnormally dehiscent anthers of bs <dig> at the heading stage  <dig>  suggesting that specific up- or down-regulation of these genes might be associated with the abnormal anther dehiscence in tgms wheat line.


CONCLUSIONS
this study analyzed the size and composition of the jaz gene family in wheat, and investigated stress responsive and differential tissue-specific expression profiles of each tajaz gene in tgms wheat line bs <dig>  in addition, we isolated  <dig> tajaz genes that would be more likely to be involved in the regulation of abnormal anther dehiscence in tgms wheat line. in conclusion, the results of this study contributed some novel and detailed information about jaz gene family in wheat, and also provided  <dig> potential candidate genes for improving the tgms wheat line.
