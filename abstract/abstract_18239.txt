BACKGROUND
necroptosis is a newly identified type of programmed cell death that differs from apoptosis. recent studies have demonstrated that necroptosis is involved in multiple pathologies of various human diseases. receptor-interacting protein  <dig>  is known to be a critical regulator of necroptosis. this study investigated alterations in the rip <dig> expression and the involvement in neural tissue damage after spinal cord injury  in mice.


RESULTS
immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the rip <dig> expression was significantly increased in the lesion site after spinal cord hemisection. the increased expression of rip <dig> started at 24 h, peaked at 3 days and lasted for at least 21 days after hemisection. the rip <dig> expression was observed in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. western blot analysis also demonstrated the rip <dig> protein expression significantly upregulated in the injured spinal cord. rip <dig> staining using propidium iodide -labeled sections showed most of the pi-labeled cells were observed as rip3-positive. double staining of tunel and rip <dig> demonstrated that tunel-positive cells exhibiting shrunken or fragmented nuclei, as generally observed in apoptotic cells, rarely expressed rip <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the present study first demonstrated that the expression of rip <dig> is dramatically upregulated in various neural cells in the injured spinal cord and peaked at 3 days after injury. additionally, most of the pi-labeled cells expressed rip <dig> in response to neural tissue damage after sci. the present study suggested that the upregulation of the rip <dig> expression may play a role as a novel molecular mechanism in secondary neural tissue damage following sci. however, further study is needed to clarify the specific molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between the rip <dig> expression and cell death in the injured spinal cord.
