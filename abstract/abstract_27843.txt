BACKGROUND
the first high quality draft of the grape genome sequence has just been published. this is a critical step in accessing all the genes of this species and increases the chances of exploiting the natural genetic diversity through association genetics. however, our basic knowledge of the extent of allelic variation within the species is still not sufficient. towards this goal, we constructed nested genetic core collections  to capture the simple sequence repeat  diversity of the grape cultivated compartment  from the world's largest germplasm collection , containing  <dig> unique genotypes.


RESULTS
sub-samples of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> varieties of v. vinifera l. were selected based on their genotypes for  <dig> ssr markers using the m-strategy. they represent respectively 58%, 73%, 83% and 100% of total ssr diversity. the capture of allelic diversity was analyzed by sequencing three genes scattered throughout the genome on  <dig> individuals:  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified using the g- <dig> core  while only  <dig> were observed using a larger sample of  <dig> individuals selected on the basis of  <dig> morphological traits, thus demonstrating the reliability of the approach.


CONCLUSIONS
the g- <dig> and g- <dig> core-collections displayed respectively 78% and 88% of the snps respectively, and are therefore of great interest for snp discovery studies. furthermore, the nested genetic core collections satisfactorily reflected the geographic and the genetic diversity of grape, which are also of great interest for the study of gene evolution in this species.
