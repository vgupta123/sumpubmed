BACKGROUND
histone modifications and histone variants are of importance in many biological processes. to understand the biological functions of the global dynamics of histone modifications and histone variants in higher plants, we elucidated the variants and post-translational modifications of histones in soybean, a legume plant with a much bigger genome than that of arabidopsis thaliana.


RESULTS
in soybean leaves, mono-, di- and tri-methylation at lysine  <dig>  lysine  <dig> and lysine  <dig>  and acetylation at lysine  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were detected in histone h <dig>  lysine  <dig> was prone to being mono-methylated, while tri-methylation was predominant at lysine  <dig>  we also observed that lysine  <dig> methylation and lysine  <dig> methylation usually excluded each other in histone h <dig>  although methylation at histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> was not reported in a. thaliana, mono- and di-methylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> were detected in soybean. besides, acetylation at lysine  <dig> and  <dig> of histone h <dig> in soybean were identified. using a combination of mass spectrometry and nano-liquid chromatography, two variants of histone h <dig> were detected and their modifications were determined. they were different at positions of a31f41s87s <dig>  and t31y41h87l <dig> , respectively. the methylation patterns in these two histone h <dig> variants also exhibited differences. lysine  <dig> and lysine  <dig> methylation were only detected in histone h <dig> , suggesting that histone variant h <dig>  might be associated with actively transcribing genes. in addition, two variants of histone h <dig>  were also detected, which were missing in other organisms. in the histone variant h <dig>  and h <dig> , the amino acid  <dig> was isoleucine and valine, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this work revealed several distinct variants of soybean histone and their modifications that were different from a. thaliana, thus providing important biological information toward further understanding of the histone modifications and their functional significance in higher plants.
