BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small endogenous non-coding interfering rna molecules regarded as major regulators in eukaryotic gene expression. different methods are employed for mirna expression profiling. for a better understanding of their role in essential biological processes, convenient methods for differential mirna expression analysis are required.


RESULTS
here, we present the mir-q assay as a highly sensitive quantitative reverse transcription pcr  for expression analysis of small rnas such as mirna molecules. it shows a high dynamic range of  <dig> to  <dig> orders of magnitude comprising a sensitivity of up to  <dig>  fm mirna, which corresponds to single copies per cell. there is nearly no cross reaction among closely-related mirna family members, which points to the high specificity of the assays. using this approach, we quantified the expression of let-7b in different human cell lines as well as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression in porcine intestinal samples.


CONCLUSIONS
mir-q is a cost-effective and highly specific approach, which neither requires the use of fluorochromic probes, nor locked nucleic acid -modified oligonucleotides. moreover, it provides a remarkable increase in specificity and simplified detection of small rnas.
