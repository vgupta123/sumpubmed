BACKGROUND
wnt <dig> is a critical signalling molecule in embryogenesis and homeostasis, but the elements that control its transcriptional regulation are largely unknown. this study uses comparative cross species sequence and functional analyses between humans and a marsupial  to refine the mammalian wnt <dig> promoter.


RESULTS
we have defined a highly conserved  <dig> bp minimal promoter region in human wnt <dig> by comparative analysis with the tammar wallaby. there are many conserved transcription factor binding sites in the proximal promoter region, including sp <dig>  myod, nfÎºb and ap <dig>  as well as highly conserved cpg islands within the human, mouse and marsupial promoters, suggesting that dna methylation may play an important role in wnt <dig> transcriptional regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
using a marsupial model, we have been able to provide new information on the transcriptional regulators in the promoter of this essential mammalian developmental gene, wnt <dig>  these transcription factor binding sites and cpg islands are highly conserved in two disparate mammals, and are likely key controlling elements in the regulation of this essential developmental gene.
