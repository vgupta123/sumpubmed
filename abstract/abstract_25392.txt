BACKGROUND
hepatoma-derived growth factor  is a nuclear protein that is a mitogen for a wide variety of cells. mass spectrometry based methods have identified hdgf as a phosphoprotein without validation or a functional consequence of this post-translational modification.


RESULTS
we found that hdgf in primary mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells  was phosphorylated. wild type hdgf was phosphorylated in asynchronous cells and substitution of s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> to alanine each demonstrated a decrease in hdgf phosphorylation. a phospho-s <dig> hdgf specific antibody was developed and demonstrated mitosis-specific phosphorylation. hdgf-s103a was not mitogenic and facs analysis demonstrated a g2/m arrest in hdgf-s103a expressing cells, whereas cells expressing hdgf-s103d showed cell cycle progression. nocodazole arrest increased s <dig> phosphorylation from  <dig> % to 29% .


CONCLUSIONS
thus, hdgf is a phosphoprotein and phosphorylation of s <dig> is mitosis related and required for its function as a mitogen. we speculate that cell cycle regulated phosphorylation of hdgf may play an important role in vascular cell proliferation.
