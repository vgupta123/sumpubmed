BACKGROUND
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  is a central enzyme in glycolysi, we performed genome-wide identification of gapdh genes in wheat and analyzed their structural characteristics and expression patterns under abiotic stress in wheat.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> gapdh genes were identified in wheat cv. chinese spring; the phylogenetic and structure analysis showed that these gapdh genes could be divided into four distinct subfamilies. the expression profiles of gapdh genes showed tissue specificity all over plant development stages. the qrt-pcr results revealed that wheat gapdhs were involved in several abiotic stress response.


CONCLUSIONS
wheat carried  <dig> gapdh genes, representing four types of plant gapdhs . whole genome duplication and segmental duplication might account for the expansion of wheat gapdhs. expression analysis implied that gapdhs play roles in plants abiotic stress tolerance.
