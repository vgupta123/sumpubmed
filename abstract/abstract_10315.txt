BACKGROUND
bovine trophoblast binucleate cells  express a plethora of molecules including bovine placental lactogen  and bovine prolactin-related protein- <dig> . bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> are members of the growth hormone /prolactin  gene family, which are expressed simultaneously in bnc and are central to placentation and the progression of pregnancy in cattle. however, there is a paucity of information on the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of both the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> genes. recent studies, however, have demonstrated that the expression of a number of genes is controlled by the methylation status of their promoter region. in the present study, we examined the cell-type-specific epigenetic alterations of the 5'-flanking region of the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> genes to gain an insight into their regulatory mechanisms.


RESULTS
analysis of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment demonstrated that bcsh <dig> expression is moderately induced in fibroblast cultures but enhanced in bt- <dig> cells. sodium bisulfite based sequencing revealed that bcsh <dig> is hypomethylated in the cotyledonary tissue but not in the fetal skin, and this pattern was not altered with the progression of pregnancy. on the other hand, the methylation status of bprp <dig> was similar between the cotyledon and fetal skin. the bprp <dig> gene was exclusively hypermethylated in a bovine trophoblast cell-derived bt- <dig> cell-line. while the activity of bcsh <dig> was similar in both bt- <dig> and bovine fibroblast cells, that of bprp <dig> was specific to bt- <dig>  treatment with a demethylating agent and luciferase assays provided in vitro evidence of the positive regulation of bcsh <dig> but not bprp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report to identify the differential regulatory mechanisms of the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> genes and indicates that bcsh <dig> might potentially be the only transcript that is subject to dna methyltransferase regulation. the data indicates the possibility of novel kinetics of induction of the synchronously expressed bnc-specific bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> transcripts, which may aid the understanding of the intricate regulation and specific role of these important molecules in bovine placentogenesis and the progression of pregnancy.
