BACKGROUND
nol <dig> is a candidate tumor suppressor that localizes to a chromosomal region 6p <dig>  this locus is frequently lost in a number of malignancies, and consistent loss of nol <dig> through loss of heterozygosity and decreased mrna and protein expression has been observed in tumors and cell lines. reintroduction of nol <dig> into cells resulted in significant suppression of in vivo tumor growth and modulation of the angiogenic phenotype. further, nol <dig> was observed to localize to the nucleus and nucleolus of cells. however, the mechanisms regulating its subcellular localization have not been elucidated.


RESULTS
an in vitro import assay demonstrated that nol <dig> requires cytosolic machinery for active nuclear transport. using sequence homology and prediction algorithms, four putative nuclear localization signals  were identified. nol <dig> deletion constructs and cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase  fusion proteins confirmed the functionality of three of these nlss. site-directed mutagenesis of pk fusions and full-length nol <dig> defined the minimal functional regions within each nls. further characterization revealed that nls <dig> and nls <dig> were critical for both the rate and efficiency of nuclear targeting. in addition, four basic clusters within nls <dig> and nls <dig> were independently capable of nucleolar targeting. the nucleolar occupancy of nol <dig> revealed a complex balance of rapid nucleoplasmic shuttling but low nucleolar mobility, suggesting nol <dig> may play functional roles in both compartments. in support, targeting to the nucleolar compartment was dependent on the presence of rna, as depletion of total rna or rrna resulted in a nucleoplasmic shift of nol <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results identify the minimal sequences required for the active targeting of nol <dig> to the nucleus and nucleolus. further, this work characterizes the relative contribution of each sequence to nol <dig> nuclear and nucleolar dynamics, the subnuclear constituents that participate in this targeting, and suggests a functional role for nol <dig> in both compartments. taken together, these results identify the requisite protein domains for nol <dig> localization, the kinetics that drive this targeting, and suggest nol <dig> may function in both the nucleus and nucleolus.
