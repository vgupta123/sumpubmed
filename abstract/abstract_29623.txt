BACKGROUND
enzyme treatment is the mainstay for management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency  in dogs. ‘enteric-coated’ preparations have been developed to protect the enzyme from degradation in the stomach, but their efficacy has not been critically evaluated. the hypothesis of the current study was that enteric coating would have no effect on the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme treatment for dogs with epi.

thirty-eight client-owned dogs with naturally occurring epi were included in this multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial. dogs received either an enteric-coated enzyme preparation  or an identical preparation without the enteric coating  over a period of  <dig> days.


RESULTS
there were no significant differences in either signalment or cobalamin status  between the dogs on the test and control treatments. body weight and body condition score increased in both groups during the trial  but the magnitude of increase was greater for the test treatment compared with the control treatment . by day  <dig>  mean body weight increase was 17%  in the test treatment group and 9%  in the control treatment group. the dose of enzyme required increased over time  but there was no significant difference between treatments at any time point . clinical disease severity score decreased over time for both groups  and no difference was noted between groups . no significant adverse effects were reported, for either treatment, for the duration of the trial.


CONCLUSIONS
enteric coating a pancreatic enzyme treatment improves response in canine epi.
