BACKGROUND
caenorhabditis elegans provides a genetically tractable model organism to investigate the network of genes involved in fat metabolism and how regulation is perturbed to produce the complex phenotype of obesity. c. elegans possess the full range of desaturases, including the Δ <dig> desaturases expressed by fat- <dig>  fat- <dig> and fat- <dig>  they regulate the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, used for the synthesis of lipids including phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters.


RESULTS
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry , gas chromatography mass spectrometry  and nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy were used to define the metabolome of all the possible knock-outs for the Δ <dig> desaturases, including for the first time intact lipids. despite the genes having similar enzymatic roles, excellent discrimination was achievable for all single and viable double mutants highlighting the distinctive roles of fat- <dig> and fat- <dig>  both expressing steroyl-coa desaturases. the metabolomic changes extend to aqueous metabolites demonstrating the influence Δ <dig> desaturases have on regulating global metabolism and highlighting how comprehensive metabolomics is more discriminatory than classically used dyes for fat staining.


CONCLUSIONS
the propagation of metabolic changes across the network of metabolism demonstrates that modification of the Δ <dig> desaturases places c.elegans into a catabolic state compared with wildtype controls.
