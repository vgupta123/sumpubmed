BACKGROUND
the versatile vacuole membrane protein  <dig>  has been previously investigated in six species. it has been shown to be essential in macroautophagy, where it takes part in autophagy initiation. in addition, vmp <dig> has been implicated in organellar biogenesis; endo-, exo- and phagocytosis, and protein secretion; apoptosis; and cell adhesion. these roles underly its proven involvement in pancreatitis, diabetes and cancer in humans.


RESULTS
in this study we analyzed a vmp <dig> homologue from the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii. crvmp <dig> knockdown lines showed severe phenotypes, mainly affecting cell division as well as the morphology of cells and organelles. we also provide several pieces of evidence for its involvement in macroautophagy.


CONCLUSIONS
our study adds a novel role to vmp1's repertoire, namely the regulation of cytokinesis. though the directness of the observed effects and the mechanisms underlying them remain to be defined, the protein's involvement in macroautophagy in chlamydomonas, as found by us, suggests that crvmp <dig> shares molecular characteristics with its animal and protist counterparts.
