BACKGROUND
salmonellosis is of great economic concern in all phases of the poultry industry, from production to marketing, leading to severe economic losses. monitoring the source of the bacterial contamination has fundamental importance in the spreading of salmonellosis.


RESULTS
we applied a ligation-mediated pcr method, pcr mp , to type s. enterica ssp. enterica ser. enteritidis  and  <dig> control strains classified to other serovars isolated from poultry. we demonstrated the pcr mp potential for salmonellosis spreading monitoring. our rapid test presents higher discriminatory power  compared to current molecular subtyping tool such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , which ineffectiveness underlies the high degree of clonality of s. enteritidis.


CONCLUSIONS
pcr mp was found to be a highly discriminating, sensitive and specific method that could be a valuable molecular tool, particularly for analyzing epidemiological links of limited number of s. enterica ser. enteritidis strains.
