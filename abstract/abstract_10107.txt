BACKGROUND
mycoplasma pneumoniae  is one of the major etiological agents for community-acquired pneumonia  in all age groups. the early host response to m. pneumoniae infection relies on the concerted release of proteins with various biological activities. however, no comprehensive analysis of the secretory proteins has been conducted to date regarding the host response upon m. pneumoniae infection.


RESULTS
we employed the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry -based label-free quantitative proteomic technology to identify and characterize the members of the human alveolar epithelial carcinoma a <dig> cell secretome during m. pneumoniae infection. a total of  <dig> proteins were identified, with  <dig> being differentially expressed , among which  <dig> were only expressed in control cells,  <dig> only in m. pneumoniae-treated cells, while  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated by m. pneumoniae. the changed expression of some of the identified proteins was validated by rt-pcr and immunoblot analysis. cellular localization analysis of the secretome data revealed  <dig> % of the proteins were considered as “putative secretory proteins”. functional analysis revealed that the proteins affected upon m. pneumoniae infection were mainly related to metabolic process, stress response, and immune response. we further examined the level of one up-regulated protein, il- <dig>  in clinical samples. the result showed that il- <dig> levels were significantly higher in the plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  of m. pneumoniae pneumonia  patients.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provided systematic information about the changes in the expression of secretory proteins during m. pneumoniae infection, which is useful for the discovery of specific biomarkers and targets for pharmacological intervention.
