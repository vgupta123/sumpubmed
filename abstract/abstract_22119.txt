BACKGROUND
by using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging  and subsequent tractography, a perisylvian language network in the human left hemisphere recently has been identified connecting brocas's and wernicke's areas directly  and indirectly by a pathway through the inferior parietal cortex.


RESULTS
applying dti tractography in the present study, we found a similar three-way pathway in the right hemisphere of  <dig> healthy individuals: a direct connection between the superior temporal and lateral frontal cortex running in parallel with an indirect connection. the latter composed of a posterior segment connecting the superior temporal with the inferior parietal cortex and an anterior segment running from the inferior parietal to the lateral frontal cortex.


CONCLUSIONS
the present dti findings suggest that the perisylvian inferior parietal, superior temporal, and lateral frontal corticies are tightly connected not only in the human left but also in the human right hemisphere.
