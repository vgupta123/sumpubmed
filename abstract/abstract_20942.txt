BACKGROUND
lysophospholipids regulate the morphology and growth of neurons, neural cell lines, and neural progenitors. a stable human neural progenitor cell line is not currently available in which to study the role of lysophospholipids in human neural development. we recently established a stable, adherent human embryonic stem cell-derived neuroepithelial  cell line which recapitulates morphological and phenotypic features of neural progenitor cells isolated from fetal tissue. the goal of this study was to determine if hes-nep cells express functional lysophospholipid receptors, and if activation of these receptors mediates cellular responses critical for neural development.


RESULTS
our results demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid  and sphingosine-1-phosphate  receptors are functionally expressed in hes-nep cells and are coupled to multiple cellular signaling pathways. we have shown that transcript levels for s1p <dig> receptor increased significantly in the transition from embryonic stem cell to hes-nep. hes-nep cells express lpa and s1p receptors coupled to gi/o g-proteins that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and to gq-like phospholipase c activity. lpa and s1p also induce p44/ <dig> erk map kinase phosphorylation in these cells and stimulate cell proliferation via gi/o coupled receptors in an epidermal growth factor receptor - and erk-dependent pathway. in contrast, lpa and s1p stimulate transient cell rounding and aggregation that is independent of egfr and erk, but dependent on the rho effector p <dig> rock.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, lysophospholipids regulate neural progenitor growth and morphology through distinct mechanisms. these findings establish human es cell-derived nep cells as a model system for studying the role of lysophospholipids in neural progenitors.
