BACKGROUND
the syndermata  is one of the best model systems for studying the evolutionary origins and persistence of different life styles because it contains a series of lineage-specific life histories: monogononta , bdelloidea , seisonidea , and acanthocephala . providing phylogenetic resolution to the question of eurotatoria  monophyly versus paraphyly is a key factor for better understanding the evolution of different life styles, yet this matter is not clearly resolved. in this study, we revisited this issue based on comparative analysis of complete mitochondrial genome information for major groups of the syndermata.


RESULTS
we determined the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences  of a bdelloid rotifer, rotaria rotatoria. in order to examine the validity of eurotatoria  monophyly/paraphyly, we performed phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences for eleven protein-coding genes sampled from a wide variety of bilaterian representatives. the resulting mitochondrial genome trees, inferred using different algorithms, consistently failed to recover monogononta and bdelloidea as monophyletic, but instead identified them as a paraphyletic assemblage. bdelloidea  shares most common ancestry with acanthocephala  rather than with monogonont b. plicatilis, the other representative of eurotatoria.


CONCLUSIONS
comparisons of inferred amino acid sequence and gene arrangement patterns with those of other metazoan mtdnas  support the hypothesis that bdelloidea shares most common ancestry with acanthocephala rather than with monogononta. from this finding, we suggest that the obligatory asexuality of bdelloideans may have secondarily derived from some other preexisting condition in earlier lineage of rotifers. providing a more complete assessment of phylogenetic relationships and inferring patterns of evolution of different types of life styles among syndermata awaits comparisons requiring mitochondrial genome sequencing of seisonidea.
