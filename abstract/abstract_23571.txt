BACKGROUND
aseptic loosening due to bone remodelling processes after total hip replacement is one common cause for revision surgery. in human medicine, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry  is the gold standard for quantitative evaluation of bone mineral density, whereas in veterinary medicine conventional radiography is used for follow-up studies. recently, a method has been described using digital x-ray images for quantitative assessment of grey scale values of bone contrast. therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation of bone mineral density  measured by dexa with grey scale values  measured in digital x-ray images  ex vivo.


RESULTS
the measured gv in the chosen x-ray settings showed on average a good correlation  to the measured bmd with dexa. correlation between the two x-ray settings was very good . for comparisons among regions of interests  a difference of  <dig> % was found to be statistically significant, whereas in the case of rx <dig> and rx <dig> differences of  <dig> % and  <dig> % were found to be statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
results indicate that measuring absolute changes in bone mineral density might be possible using digital radiography. not all significant differences between rois detectable with dexa can be displayed in the x-ray images because of the lower sensitivity of the radiographs. however, direct comparison of grey scale values of the periprosthetic femur in one individual patient during the follow-up period, in order to predict bone remodelling processes, should be possible, but with a lesser sensitivity than with dexa. it is important that the same x-ray settings are chosen for each patient for follow-up studies.
