BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  constitute more than 90% of the genetic variation, and hence can account for most trait differences among individuals in a given species. polymorphism detection software polybayes and polyphred give high false positive snp predictions even with stringent parameter values. we developed a machine learning  method to augment polybayes to improve its prediction accuracy. ml methods have also been successfully applied to other bioinformatics problems in predicting genes, promoters, transcription factor binding sites and protein structures.


RESULTS
the ml program c <dig>  was applied to a set of features in order to build a snp classifier from training data based on human expert decisions . the training data were  <dig>  candidate snp generated by sequencing  <dig> sts   in both directions from  <dig> diverse homozygous soybean cultivars and polybayes analysis. test data of  <dig>  candidate snp were generated similarly from  <dig> additional sts . snp from both sets were classified by experts. after training the ml classifier, it agreed with the experts on  <dig> % of test data compared with  <dig> % agreement between polybayes and experts. the polybayes positive predictive values   were  <dig> % for all predictions and  <dig> % for those with 100% posterior probability of being real. using ml improved the ppv to  <dig> %, a 5- to 10-fold increase. while both ml and polybayes produced a similar number of true positives, the ml program generated only  <dig> false positives as compared to  <dig>  for polybayes. the complexity of the soybean genome may have contributed to high false snp predictions by polybayes and hence results may differ for other genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
a machine learning  method was developed as a supplementary feature to the polymorphism detection software for improving prediction accuracies. the results from this study indicate that a trained ml classifier can significantly reduce human intervention and in this case achieved a 5â€“ <dig> fold enhanced productivity. the optimized feature set and ml framework can also be applied to all polymorphism discovery software. ml support software is written in perl and can be easily integrated into an existing snp discovery pipeline.
