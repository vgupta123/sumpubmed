BACKGROUND
copy number variants  account for a significant proportion of normal phenotypic variation and may have an important role in human pathological variation. the α-defensin cluster on human chromosome 8p <dig>  is one of the better-characterized cnvs, in which high copy number variability affecting the defa <dig> and defa <dig> genes has been reported. moreover, the defa <dig> gene has been found to be absent in a significant proportion of control population subjects. cnvs involving immune genes, such as α-defensins, are possibly contributing to innate immunity differences observed between individuals and influence predisposition and susceptibility to disease.


RESULTS
we have tested the defa <dig> absence in  <dig> samples from different human populations. the proportion of subjects lacking defa <dig> has been found to vary from 10% to 37%, depending on the population tested, suggesting differences in innate immune function between populations. absence of defa <dig> was correlated with the region's haplotype block structure. african samples showed a higher intra-populational variability together with the highest proportion of subjects without defa <dig> . association analysis of defa <dig> absence with  <dig> snps from a 100-kb region identified a conserved haplotype in the caucasian population, extending for the whole region.


CONCLUSIONS
complexity and variability are essential genomic features of the α-defensin cluster at the 8p <dig>  region. the identification of population differences in subjects lacking the defa <dig> gene may be suggestive of population-specific selective pressures with potential impact on human health.
