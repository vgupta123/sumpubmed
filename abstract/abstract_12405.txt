BACKGROUND
gray leaf spot  caused by cercospora zeae-maydis  or cercospora zeina  is a devastating maize disease and results in substantial yield reductions worldwide. gls resistance is a quantitatively inherited trait. the development and cultivation of gls-resistant maize hybrids are the most cost-effective and efficient ways to control this disease.


RESULTS
we previously detected a major gls resistance qtl, qrgls <dig>  in bin  <dig> – <dig>  which spans the whole centromere of chromosome  <dig> encompassing a physical distance of ~110-mb. with advanced backcross populations derived from the cross between the resistant y <dig> and susceptible q <dig> inbred lines, a sequential recombinant-derived progeny testing strategy was adapted to fine map qrgls <dig>  we narrowed the region of qrgls <dig> from an initial ~110-mb to an interval of ~1-mb, flanked by the markers g <dig> and dd <dig>  qrgls <dig> showed predominantly additive genetic effects and significantly increased the resistance percentage by  <dig>  to  <dig> % across multiple generations. a total of  <dig> genes were predicted in the mapped region according to the 5b. <dig> annotation of the maize b <dig> genome v <dig>  two pieces of the mapped qrgls <dig> region shared collinearity with two distant segments on maize chromosome  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
qrgls <dig>  a major qtl involved in gls resistance, was mapped to a ~1-mb region close to the centromere of chromosome  <dig>  there are  <dig> predicted genes in the mapped region. it is assumed that qrgls <dig> could be widely used to improve maize resistance to gls.
