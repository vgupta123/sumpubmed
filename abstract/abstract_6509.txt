BACKGROUND
ever since the recent completion of the peach genome, the focus of genetic research in this area has turned to the identification of genes related to important traits, such as fruit aroma volatiles. of the over  <dig> volatile compounds described in peach, lactones most likely have the strongest effect on fruit aroma, while esters, terpenoids, and aldehydes have minor, yet significant effects. the identification of key genes underlying the production of aroma compounds is of interest for any fruit-quality improvement strategy.


RESULTS
volatile  and gene expression  levels were profiled in peach fruit from a maturity time-course series belonging to two peach genotypes that showed considerable differences in maturation characteristics and postharvest ripening. this data set was analyzed by complementary correlation-based approaches to discover the genes related to the main aroma-contributing compounds: lactones, esters, and phenolic volatiles, among others. as a case study, one of the candidate genes was cloned and expressed in yeast to show specificity as an Ï‰- <dig> oleate desaturase, which may be involved in the production of a precursor of lactones/esters.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach revealed a set of genes  that are highly associated with peach fruit volatiles, and which could prove useful in breeding or for biotechnological purposes.
