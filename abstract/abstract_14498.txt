BACKGROUND
the smoothelin-like  <dig> protein  can associate with tropomyosin  and calmodulin , two proteins essential to the smooth muscle contractile process. smtnl <dig> is phosphorylated at ser <dig> by protein kinase a during calcium desensitization in smooth muscle, yet the effect of smtnl <dig> phosphorylation on tpm- and cam-binding has yet to be investigated.


RESULTS
using pull down studies with tpm-sepharose and cam-sepharose, we examined the interplay between tpm binding, cam binding, phosphorylation of smtnl <dig> and calcium concentration. phosphorylation greatly enhanced the ability of smtnl <dig> to associate with tpm in vitro; surface plasmon resonance yielded a 10-fold enhancement in k
d value with phosphorylation. the effect on cam binding is more complex and varies with the availability of calcium.


CONCLUSIONS
combining both cam and tpm with smtnl <dig> shows that the binding to both is mutually exclusive.
