BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis, an intracellular pathogen encounters redox stress throughout its life inside the host. in order to protect itself from the redox onslaughts of host immune system, m. tuberculosis appears to have developed accessory thioredoxin-like proteins which are represented by orfs encoding whib-like proteins. we have earlier reported that whib1/rv <dig> is a thioredoxin like protein of m. tuberculosis and functions as a protein disulfide reductase. generally thioredoxins have many substrate proteins. the current study aims to identify the substrate protein of m. tuberculosis whib <dig> 


RESULTS
using yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified alpha -glucan branching enzyme  of m. tuberculosis as a interaction partner of whib <dig>  in vitro gst pull down assay confirmed the direct physical interaction between glgb and whib <dig>  both mass spectrometry data of tryptic digests and in vitro labeling of cysteine residues with 4-acetamido-4' maleimidyl-stilbene- <dig>  2'-disulfonic acid showed that in glgb, c <dig> and c <dig> are free but c <dig> and c <dig> form an intra-molecular disulfide bond. whib <dig> has a c37xxc <dig> motif thus a c40s mutation renders c <dig> to exist as a free thiol to form a hetero-disulfide bond with the cysteine residue of substrate protein. a disulfide mediated binary complex formation between glgb and whib1c40s was shown by both in-solution protein-protein interaction and thioredoxin affinity chromatography. finally, transfer of reducing equivalent from whib <dig> to glgb disulfide was confirmed by 4-acetamido-4' maleimidyl-stilbene- <dig>  2'-disulfonic acid trapping by the reduced disulfide of glgb. two different thioredoxins, trxb/rv <dig> and trxc/rv <dig> of m. tuberculosis could not perform this reaction suggesting that the reduction of glgb by whib <dig> is specific.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that m. tuberculosis glgb has one intra-molecular disulfide bond which is formed between c <dig> and c <dig>  whib <dig>  a thioredoxin like protein interacts with glgb and transfers its electrons to the disulfide thus reduces the intra-molecular disulfide bond of glgb. for the first time, we report that glgb is one of the in vivo substrate of m. tuberculosis whib <dig>
