BACKGROUND
in the genome of h. pylori  <dig>   <dig> proteins containing the cxxc motif characteristic of thioldisulfide oxidoreductases have been identified to date. however, only two of these proteins have a thioredoxin-like fold  and are periplasm-located. we have previously shown that hp <dig> is a dimeric oxidoreductase that catalyzes disulfide bond formation in the periplasm. although hp <dig> was originally described as dsbc homologue, its resolved structure and location of the hp <dig> gene in the genome indicate that it is a counterpart of ccmg/dsbe.


RESULTS
the present work shows that hp <dig> is present in h. pylori cells only in a reduced form and that absence of the main periplasmic oxidase hp <dig> influences its redox state. our biochemical analysis indicates that hp <dig> is a specific reductase, as it does not reduce insulin. however, it possesses disulfide isomerase activity, as it catalyzes the refolding of scrambled rnase. additionally, although its standard redox potential is - <dig> mv, it is the first described ccmg protein having an acidic pka of the n-terminal cysteine of the cxxc motif, similar to e. coli dsba or e. coli dsbc. the ccmg proteins that play a role in a cytochrome c-maturation, both in system i and system ii, are kept in the reduced form by an integral membrane protein dsbd or its analogue, ccda. in h. pylori hp <dig> is re-reduced by ccda ; however in e. coli it remains in the oxidized state as it does not interact with e. coli dsbd. our in vivo work also suggests that both hp <dig>  which plays a role in apocytochrome reduction, and hp <dig>  which is involved in heme transport and its ligation into apocytochrome, provide essential functions in h. pylori.


CONCLUSIONS
the present data, in combination with the resolved three-dimensional structure of the hp <dig>  suggest that hp <dig> is an unusual, multifunctional ccmg protein.
