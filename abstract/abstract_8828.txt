BACKGROUND
the disease botulism is caused by intoxication with botulinum neurotoxins , extremely toxic proteins which cause paralysis. this neurotoxin is produced by some members of the clostridium botulinum and closely related species, and is produced as a protein complex consisting of the neurotoxin and neurotoxin-associated proteins . there are seven known serotypes of bont, a-g, and the composition of the naps can differ between these serotypes. it was previously published that the bont/g complex consisted of bont/g, nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin , hemagglutinin  <dig> , and ha- <dig>  but that ha- <dig>  a component of the protein complex of other serotypes of bont, was not found.

methods
components of the bont/g complex were first separated by sds-page, and bands corresponding to components of the complex were digested and analyzed by lc-ms/ms.


RESULTS
gel bands were identified with sequence coverages of 91 % for bont/g, 91 % for ntnh, 89 % for ha- <dig>  and 88 % for ha- <dig>  notably, one gel band was also clearly identified as ha- <dig> with 93 % sequence coverage.


CONCLUSIONS
the bont/g complex consists of bont/g, ntnh, ha- <dig>  ha- <dig>  and ha- <dig>  these proteins form the progenitor form of bont/g, similar to all other ha positive progenitor toxin complexes.
