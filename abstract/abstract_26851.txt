BACKGROUND
we correlated genotypes, virulence factors and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of nosocomially identified pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from clinical specimens to those of environmental isolates encountered in the same units of a medical center. antibiotic susceptibility testing, rapd analysis and detection of enzymatic activities of extracellular virulence factors, were done on these isolates.


RESULTS
data showed that most of the clinical and environmental isolates were susceptible to tested antimicrobial agents. rapd analysis determined the presence of  <dig> genotypes, with genotype  <dig> detected in 42% of the clinical isolates and 43% of the environmental isolates. enzymatic activity testing showed that genotype  <dig> produced all virulence factors tested for.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data demonstrated the predominant prevalence of a potentially virulent p. aeruginosa genotype, circulating in a number of units of the medical center and emphasize the need to reinforce infection control measures.
