BACKGROUND
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis is essential to control physiological stress responses in mammals. its dysfunction is related to several mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. the aim of this study was to identify genetic loci underlying the endocrine regulation of the hpa axis.

method
high  and low  anxiety-related behaviour mice were established by selective inbreeding of outbred cd- <dig> mice to model extremes in trait anxiety. additionally, hab vs. lab mice exhibit comorbid characteristics including a differential corticosterone response upon stress exposure. we crossbred hab and lab lines to create f <dig> and f <dig> offspring. to identify the contribution of the endocrine phenotypes to the total phenotypic variance, we examined multiple behavioural paradigms together with corticosterone secretion-based phenotypes in f <dig> mice by principal component analysis. further, to pinpoint the genomic loci of the quantitative trait of the hpa axis stress response, we conducted genome-wide multipoint oligogenic linkage analyses based on bayesian markov chain monte carlo approach as well as parametric linkage in three-generation pedigrees, followed by a two-dimensional scan for epistasis and association analysis in freely segregating f <dig> mice using  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphisms , which were identified to consistently differ between hab and lab mice as genetic markers.


RESULTS
hpa axis reactivity measurements and behavioural phenotypes were represented by independent principal components and demonstrated no correlation. based on this finding, we identified one single quantitative trait locus  on chromosome  <dig> showing a very strong evidence for linkage  >  <dig>  lod > 23) and significant association  to the neuroendocrine stress response. the location of the linkage peak was estimated at  <dig>  cm  and was shown to be in epistasis  with the locus at  <dig>  cm on the same chromosome. the qtl harbours genes involved in steroid synthesis and cardiovascular effects.


CONCLUSIONS
the very prominent effect on stress-induced corticosterone secretion of the genomic locus on chromosome  <dig> and its involvement in epistasis highlights the critical role of this specific locus in the regulation of the hpa axis.
