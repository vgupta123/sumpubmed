BACKGROUND
the mouse embryonic mandible comprises two types of tooth primordia in the cheek region: progressive tooth primordia of prospective functional teeth and rudimentary tooth primordia in premolar region – ms and r <dig>  mice lacking sprouty genes develop supernumerary tooth in front of the lower m <dig>  primordium during embryogenesis. we focused on temporal-spatial dynamics of sonic hedgehog expression as a marker of early odontogenesis during supernumerary tooth development.


RESULTS
using mouse embryos with different dosages of spry <dig> and spry <dig> genes, we showed that during the normal development of m <dig> in the mandible the sooner appearing shh signaling domain of the r <dig> bud transiently coexisted with the later appearing shh expression domain in the early m <dig> primordium. both domains subsequently fused together to form the typical signaling center representing primary enamel knot  of m <dig> germ at embryonic day   <dig> . however, in embryos with lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages, we observed a non-fusion of original r <dig> and m <dig> shh signaling domains with consequent formation of a supernumerary tooth primordium from the isolated r <dig> bud.


CONCLUSIONS
our results bring new insight to the development of the first lower molar of mouse embryos and define simple tooth unit capable of individual development, as well as determine its influence on normal and abnormal development of the tooth row which reflect evolutionarily conserved tooth pattern. our findings contribute significantly to existing knowledge about supernumerary tooth formation.
