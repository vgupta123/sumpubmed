BACKGROUND
monocytes and macrophages produce interleukin - <dig>  an immunoregulatory cytokine and a potent therapeutic tool for immune disorders. augmentation of il- <dig> production with a concomitant reduction of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages in vitro is attained by doubly stimulating the cells with a toll-like receptor ligand and immunoglobulin g immune complexes, a response known as that of regulatory  macrophages. however, it has not been explored sufficiently how such a regulatory response could be exploited for anti-inflammation. our objective is to find a potential way or condition for augmenting il- <dig> by monocytes/macrophages in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
we show that platelets, when they are opsonized with igg, can convert human peripheral blood circulating monocytes to il-10-producing regulatory monocytes in vitro and also in a murine in vivo model. co-culturing of platelets and monocytes in the presence of anti-integrin igg and a bacterial lipopolysaccharide augmented il- <dig> production via a direct interaction between platelets and monocytes. this novel way of enhancing il- <dig> was mediated by activating-type fc receptors for igg.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that the igg-bound platelet-induced conversion of monocytes to regulatory cells might provide a novel strategy for controlling inflammation.
