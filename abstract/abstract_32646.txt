BACKGROUND
leptospires lack many of the homologs for oxidative defense present in other bacteria, but do encode homologs of the bacteriodes aerotolerance  proteins, which have been proposed to fulfill this function. bat homologs have been identified in all families of the phylum spirochaetes, yet a specific function for these proteins has not been experimentally demonstrated.


RESULTS
we investigated the contribution of the bat proteins in the model organism leptospira biflexa for their potential contributions to growth rate, morphology and protection against oxidative challenges. a genetically engineered mutant strain in which all bat orfs were deleted did not exhibit altered growth rate or morphology, relative to the wild-type strain. nor could we demonstrate a protective role for the bat proteins in coping with various oxidative stresses. further, pre-exposing l. biflexa to sublethal levels of reactive oxygen species did not appear to induce a general oxidative stress response, in contrast to what has been shown in other bacterial species. differential proteomic analysis of the wild-type and mutant strains detected changes in the abundance of a single protein only â€“ htpg, which is encoded by the gene immediately downstream of the bat loci.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here do not support a protective role for the leptospira bat proteins in directly coping with oxidative stress as previously proposed. l. biflexa is relatively sensitive to reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and h2o <dig>  suggesting that this spirochete lacks a strong, protective defense against oxidative damage despite being a strict aerobe.
