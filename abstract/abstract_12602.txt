BACKGROUND
in a transgenic mouse model of alzheimer disease , cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein  by the α-secretase adam <dig> prevented amyloid plaque formation, and alleviated cognitive deficits. furthermore, adam <dig> overexpression increased the cortical synaptogenesis. these results suggest that upregulation of adam <dig> in the brain has beneficial effects on ad pathology.


RESULTS
to assess the influence of adam <dig> on the gene expression profile in the brain, we performed a microarray analysis using rna isolated from brains of five months old mice overexpressing either the α-secretase adam <dig>  or a dominant-negative mutant  of this enzyme. as compared to non-transgenic wild-type mice, in adam <dig> transgenic mice  <dig> genes, and in dnadam <dig> mice  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed. a higher number of genes was differentially regulated in double-transgenic mouse strains additionally expressing the human app mutant.

overexpression of proteolytically active adam <dig> affected several physiological pathways, such as cell communication, nervous system development, neuron projection as well as synaptic transmission. although adam <dig> has been implicated in notch and β-catenin signaling, no significant changes in the respective target genes were observed in adult adam <dig> transgenic mice.

real-time rt-pcr confirmed a downregulation of genes coding for the inflammation-associated proteins s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> induced by moderate adam <dig> overexpression. overexpression of the dominant-negative form dnadam <dig> led to a significant increase in the expression of the fatty acid-binding protein fabp <dig>  which also has been found in higher amounts in brains of down syndrome patients.


CONCLUSIONS
in general, there was only a moderate alteration of gene expression in adam <dig> overexpressing mice. genes coding for pro-inflammatory or pro-apoptotic proteins were not over-represented among differentially regulated genes. even a decrease of inflammation markers was observed. these results are further supportive for the strategy to treat ad by increasing the α-secretase activity.
