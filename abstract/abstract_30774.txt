BACKGROUND
prepulse inhibition  of the startle response is an important tool to investigate the biology of schizophrenia. ppi is usually observed by use of a startle reflex such as blinking following an intense sound. a similar phenomenon has not been reported for cortical responses.


RESULTS
in  <dig> healthy subjects, change-related cortical activity in response to an abrupt increase of sound pressure by  <dig> db above the background of  <dig> db spl  was measured using magnetoencephalography. the test stimulus evoked a clear cortical response peaking at around  <dig> ms . in experiment  <dig>  effects of the intensity of a prepulse  on the test response were examined using a paired stimulation paradigm. in experiment  <dig>  effects of the interval between the prepulse and test stimulus were examined using interstimulus intervals  of  <dig> ~  <dig> ms. when the test stimulus was preceded by the prepulse, the change-n1m was more strongly inhibited by a stronger prepulse  and a shorter isi prepulse . in addition, the amplitude of the test change-n1m correlated positively with both the amplitude of the prepulse-evoked response and the degree of inhibition, suggesting that subjects who are more sensitive to the auditory change are more strongly inhibited by the prepulse.


CONCLUSIONS
since change-n1m is easy to measure and control, it would be a valuable tool to investigate mechanisms of sensory gating or the biology of certain mental diseases such as schizophrenia.
