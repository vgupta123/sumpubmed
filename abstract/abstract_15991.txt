BACKGROUND
staphylococcus intermedius has been isolated from healthy dogs and pigeons as well as diseased dogs. similar to staphylococcus aureus, s. intermedius is known to carry many virulence factors but most of these factors remain to be studied. in this study, we examined  <dig> s. intermedius isolates  for their hemolytic activity, biofilm formation, protease activity, and clumping factor and protein a production.


RESULTS
forty-three dog isolates  and all pigeon isolates were hemolytic on sheep rbcs with a mean hemolytic titer of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, whereas  <dig> dog isolates  and  <dig> pigeon isolates  exhibited a significant difference in their hemolytic activity on rabbit rbcs with a mean hemolytic titer of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the mean biofilm formation activity for dog isolates was  <dig> , which was significantly higher than that  for pigeon isolates . twenty-four dog isolates  and  <dig> pigeon isolates  were protease positive. twenty-four dog isolates  were clumping factor- and protein a- positive.


CONCLUSIONS
s. intermedius strains carrying the virulence factors examined in this study were more prevalent in dogs than pigeons.
