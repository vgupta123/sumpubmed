BACKGROUND
the nasal microbiota of pigs has been poorly assessed but could play a role in carriage of important microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus . the objectives of this study were to describe the nasal microbiota in slaughter age pigs, to evaluate the impact of farm management on the nasal microbiota and to provide a preliminary assessment of the influence of the microbiota on mrsa carriage.


RESULTS
nasal swabs were collected from five mrsa positive and eight mrsa negative pigs on one farm that used a liquid feeding system and routine tylosin treatment, and seven mrsa negative pigs from an antibiotic-free farm that used conventional feeding. a total of  <dig> sequences passed all quality control filters. the number of sequences per sample ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . catchall analysis of richness predicted a mean of  <dig> otus . overall,  <dig> otus were identified, yet  <dig>  were identified less than  <dig> times and the  <dig> most abundant otus accounted for  <dig> % of sequences. proteobacteria predominated in all but two samples. liquid-fed/tylosin-exposed pigs had significantly lower relative abundances of verrucomicrobia , fibrobacteres  and sequences unclassified at the phylum level . when comparing only liquid-fed pigs, mrsa carriers had significantly more bacteroidetes  than mrsa negative pigs.  <dig> genera were identified, with moraxella accounting for  <dig> % of sequences. in the jaccard index tree, five of eight mrsa positive pigs clustered closely together, as did six of the seven conventionally-fed pigs. a significant difference was identified between conventional and liquid-fed pigs using parsimony test with the jaccard  but not the yue&clayton  index. there were no significant differences between mrsa positive and negative pigs . otus belonging to firmicutes were the main indicators of mrsa negative pigs, including lactobacillus and another lactobacillaceae and staphylococcus.


CONCLUSIONS
farm management can influence the nasal microbiota in pigs, but no impact of the microbiota on mrsa carriage was identified. studies that further define the impact of management on the microbiota, and the impact of the microbiota on pathogen carriage are indicated.
