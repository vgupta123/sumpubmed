BACKGROUND
human telomerase reverse transcriptase , the catalytic subunit of telomesase, is responsible for telomere maintenance and its reactivation is implicated in almost 90% human cancers. recent evidences show that htert is essential for neoplastic transformation independent of its canonical function. however, the roles of htert in the process remain elusive. in the current work, we explore the extra-telomeric role of htert in the neoplastic transformation of fibroblast imr <dig> 


RESULTS
here we established transformed imr <dig> cells by co-expression of three oncogenic factors, namely, h-ras, sv <dig> large-t antigen and htert . the rsh-transformed cells acquired hallmarks of cancer, such as they can grow under anchorage independent conditions; self-sufficient in growth signals; attenuated response to apoptosis; and possessed recurrent chromosomal abnormalities. furthermore, the rsh-transformed cells showed enhanced migration capability which was also observed in imr <dig> cells expressing htert alone, indicating that htert plays a role in cell migration, and thus possibly contribute to their metastatic potential during tumor transformation. this notion was further supported by our microarray analysis. in addition, we found that ku <dig> were exclusively upregulated in both rsh-transformed imr <dig> cells and htert-overexpressing imr <dig> cells, suggesting the potential role of htert in dna damage response .


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our study revealed the extra-telomeric effects of htert in cell migration and ddr during neoplastic transformation.
