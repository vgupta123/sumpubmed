BACKGROUND
the nonautonomous maize ds transposons can only move in the presence of the autonomous element ac. they comprise a heterogeneous group that share 11-bp terminal inverted repeats  and some subterminal repeats, but vary greatly in size and composition. three classes of ds elements can cause mutations: ds-del, internal deletions of the  <dig> -kb ac element; ds <dig>  ~400-bp in size and sharing little homology with ac, and ds <dig>  variably-sized elements containing about  <dig>  kb from the ac termini and unrelated internal sequences. here, we analyze the entire complement of ds-related sequences in the genome of the inbred b <dig> and ask whether additional classes of ds-like  elements, not uncovered genetically, are mobilized by ac. we also compare the makeup of ds-related sequences in two maize inbreds of different origin.


RESULTS
we found  <dig> elements with 11-bp ac/ds tirs flanked by 8-bp target site duplications. three resemble ac, but carry small rearrangements. the others are much shorter, once extraneous insertions are removed. there are  <dig> ds <dig> and  <dig> ds <dig> elements, many of which are likely mobilized by ac, and two novel classes of ds-l elements. ds-l <dig> elements lack subterminal homology with ac, but carry transposase gene fragments, and represent decaying ac elements. there are  <dig> such elements in b <dig>  ds-l <dig> elements share little similarity with ac outside of the 11-bp tir, have a modal length of ~ <dig> kb, and carry filler dna which, in a few cases, could be matched to gene fragments. most ds-related elements in b <dig>  fall in this class. none of the ds-l elements tested responded to ac. only half of ds insertion sites examined are shared between the inbreds b <dig> and w <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the majority of ds-related sequences in maize correspond to ds-l elements that do not transpose in the presence of ac. unlike actively transposing elements, many ds-l elements are inserted in repetitive dna, where they probably become methylated and begin to decay. the filler dna present in most elements is occasionally captured from genes, a rare feature in transposons of the hat superfamily to which ds belongs. maize inbreds of different origin are highly polymorphic in their dna transposon makeup.
