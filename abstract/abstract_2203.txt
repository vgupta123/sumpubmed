BACKGROUND
a key challenge for modelling infectious disease dynamics is to understand the spatial spread of infection in real landscapes. this ideally requires a parallel record of spatial epidemic spread and a detailed map of susceptible host density along with relevant transport links and geographical features.


RESULTS
here we analyse the most detailed such data to date arising from the uk  <dig> foot and mouth epidemic. we show that euclidean distance between infectious and susceptible premises is a better predictor of transmission risk than shortest and quickest routes via road, except where major geographical features intervene.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, a simple spatial transmission kernel based on euclidean distance suffices in most regions, probably reflecting the multiplicity of transmission routes during the epidemic.
