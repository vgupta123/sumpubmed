BACKGROUND
in the model legume medicago truncatula, the near saturation genome-wide tnt <dig> insertion mutant population in ecotype r <dig> is a valuable tool in functional genomics studies. forward genetic screens have identified many tnt <dig> mutants defective in nodule development and symbiotic nitrogen fixation . however, progress toward identifying the causative mutations of these symbiotic mutants has been slow because of the high copy number of tnt <dig> insertions in some mutant plants and inefficient recovery of flanking sequence tags  by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr  and other techniques.


RESULTS
two tnt <dig> symbiotic mutants, nf <dig> and nf <dig>  with defects in nodulation and snf were isolated during a forward genetic screen. both tail-pcr and whole genome sequencing  approaches were used in attempts to find the relevant mutant genes in nf <dig> and nf <dig>  illumina paired-end wgs generated ~ <dig> gb of sequence data from a 500 bp insert library for each mutant, yielding ~40x genome coverage. bioinformatics analysis of the sequence data identified  <dig> and  <dig> high confidence independent tnt <dig> insertion loci in nf <dig> and nf <dig>  respectively. in comparison to tail-pcr, wgs recovered more tnt <dig> insertions. from the wgs data, we found tnt <dig> insertions in the exons of the previously described phospholipase c -like and nodule inception  genes in nf <dig> and nf <dig> mutants, respectively. co-segregation analyses confirmed that the symbiotic phenotypes of nf <dig> and nf <dig> are tightly linked to the tnt <dig> insertions in plc-like and nin genes, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we demonstrate that wgs is an efficient approach for identification of causative genes underlying snf defective phenotypes in m. truncatula tnt <dig> insertion mutants obtained via forward genetic screens.
