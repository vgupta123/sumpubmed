BACKGROUND
auditory feedback is important for accurate control of voice fundamental frequency . the purpose of this study was to address whether task instructions could influence the compensatory responding and sensorimotor adaptation that has been previously found when participants are presented with a series of frequency-altered feedback  trials. trained singers and musically untrained participants  were informed that their auditory feedback would be manipulated in pitch while they sang the target vowel . participants were instructed to either ‘compensate’ for, or ‘ignore’ the changes in auditory feedback. whole utterance auditory feedback manipulations were either gradually presented  in - <dig> cent increments down to - <dig> cents  or were suddenly  shifted down by  <dig> semitone.


RESULTS
results indicated that singers and nonsingers could not suppress their compensatory responses to faf, nor could they reduce the sensorimotor adaptation observed during both the ramp and constant faf trials.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to previous research, these data suggest that musical training is effective in suppressing compensatory responses only when faf occurs after vocal onset . moreover, our data suggest that compensation and adaptation are automatic and are influenced little by conscious control.
