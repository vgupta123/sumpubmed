BACKGROUND
aspirin eugenol ester  is a promising drug candidate for treatment of inflammation, pain and fever and prevention of cardiovascular diseases with less side effects. the experiment will be conducted to investigate the efficacy of aee on curing hyperlipidemia in wistar rats. the rats were fed with high fat diet  for 8 weeks to induce hyperlipidemia.


RESULTS
compared with the model group, the results showed that aee at 54 mg/kg dosage could significantly decrease the hyperlipidemia indexes including triglyceride , low density lipoprotein  and total cholesterol  , increase high density lipoprotein   for five weeks drug administration. meanwhile, simvastatin had same effect on hyperlipidemia indexes such as tg, ldl, tc, but no significant increase in hdl.


CONCLUSIONS
aee was effective against hyperlipidemia and had better anti-hyperlipidemic effect than its component, acetylsalicylic acid , eugenol and integration of asa and eugenol. under the experimental circumstance, the optimal dose of aee to cure hyperlipidemia is 54 mg/kg for five weeks in wistar rats.
