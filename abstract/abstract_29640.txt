BACKGROUND
during plant tissue morphogenesis cells have to coordinate their behavior to allow the generation of the size, shape and cellular patterns that distinguish an organ. despite impressive progress the underlying signaling pathways remain largely unexplored. in arabidopsis thaliana, the atypical leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase strubbelig  is involved in signal transduction in several developmental processes including the formation of carpels, petals, ovules and root hair patterning. the three strubbelig-like mutant  genes detorqueo , quirky  and zerzaust  are considered central elements of sub-mediated signal transduction pathways as corresponding mutants share most phenotypic aspects with sub mutants.


RESULTS
here we show that doq corresponds to the previously identified angustifolia gene. the genetic analysis revealed that the doq- <dig> mutant exhibits all additional mutant phenotypes and conversely that other an alleles show the slm phenotypes. we further provide evidence that sub and an physically interact and that an is not required for subcellular localization of sub.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that an is involved in sub signal transduction pathways. in addition, they reveal previously unreported functions of an in several biological processes, such as ovule development, cell morphogenesis in floral meristems, and root hair patterning. finally, sub and an may directly interact at the plasma membrane to mediate sub-dependent signaling.
