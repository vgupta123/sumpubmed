BACKGROUND
among the largest and most diverse transcription factor families in plants, basic leucine zipper  family participate in regulating various processes, including floral induction and development, stress and hormone signaling, photomorphogenesis, seed maturation and germination, and pathogen defense. although common wheat  is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world, there is no comprehensive analysis of bzips in wheat, especially those involved in anther development. previous studies have demonstrated wheat, t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and brachypodium are evolutionarily close in gramineae family, however, the real evolutionary relationship still remains mysterious.


RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> bzip family genes were comprehensively identified from current wheat genome.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members of bzip family were also identified from the genomes of t.urartu, ae.tauschii and barley, respectively. orthology analyses suggested  <dig>  % of tubzips were orthologous to  <dig>  % of aetbzips and wheat had many more in-paralogs in the bzip family than its relatives. it was deduced wheat had a closer phylogenetic relationship with barley and brachypodium than t.urartu and ae.tauschii. bzip proteins in wheat, t.urartu and ae.tauschii were divided into  <dig> subgroups based on phylogenetic analyses. using affymetrix microarray data,  <dig> differentially expressed tabzip genes were identified to be related to anther development from comparison between the male sterility line and the restorer line. genes with close evolutionary relationship tended to share similar gene structures.  <dig> of  <dig> selected tabzip genes contained ltr elements in their promoter regions. expression of  <dig> among these  <dig> tabzip genes were obviously responsive to low temperature. these  <dig> tabzip genes all exhibited distinct tissue-specific expression pattern. among them,  <dig> tabzip genes were predominantly expressed in anther and most of them showed over-dominance expression mode in the cross combination ty806 × bs <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the genome-wide identification provided an overall insight of bzip gene family in wheat and its relatives. the evolutionary relationship of wheat and its relatives was proposed based on orthology analyses. microarray and expression analyses suggested the potential involvement of bzip genes in anther development and facilitated selection of anther development related gene for further functional characterization.
