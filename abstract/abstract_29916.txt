BACKGROUND
basic helix-loop-helix e proteins are transcription factors that play crucial roles in t cell development by controlling thymocyte proliferation, differentiation and survival. e protein functions can be repressed by their naturally occurring inhibitors, id proteins . transgenic expression of id <dig> blocks t cell development and causes massive apoptosis of developing thymocytes. however, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely understood due to relatively little knowledge of the target genes regulated by e proteins.


RESULTS
we designed a unique strategy to search for genes directly controlled by e proteins and found rorγt to be a top candidate. using microarray analyses and reverse-transcriptase pcr assays, we showed that id <dig> expression diminished rorγt mrna levels in t cell lines and primary thymocytes while induction of e protein activity restored rorγt expression. e proteins were found to specifically bind to the promoter region of rorγt, suggesting their role in activating transcription of the gene. functional significance of e protein-controlled rorγt expression was established based on the finding that rorγt rescued apoptosis caused by id <dig> overexpression. furthermore, expression of rorγt prevented id1-induced p <dig> map kinase hyper-activation.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that e protein-dependent rorγt gene expression aids the survival of developing thymocytes, which provides a possible explanation for the massive apoptosis found in id <dig> transgenic mice.
