BACKGROUND
the immunity-related gtpases  constitute a powerful cell-autonomous resistance system against several intracellular pathogens. irga <dig> is a dynamin-like protein that oligomerizes at the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane  of toxoplasma gondii leading to its vesiculation. based on a previous biochemical analysis, it has been proposed that the gtpase domains of irga <dig> dimerize in an antiparallel fashion during oligomerization.


RESULTS
we determined the crystal structure of an oligomerization-impaired irga <dig> mutant bound to a non-hydrolyzable gtp analog. contrary to the previous model, the structure shows that the gtpase domains dimerize in a parallel fashion. the nucleotides in the center of the interface participate in dimerization by forming symmetric contacts with each other and with the switch i region of the opposing irga <dig> molecule. the latter contact appears to activate gtp hydrolysis by stabilizing the position of the catalytic glutamate  <dig> in switch i close to the active site. further dimerization contacts involve switch ii, the g <dig> helix and the trans stabilizing loop.


CONCLUSIONS
the irga <dig> structure features a parallel gtpase domain dimer, which appears to be a unifying feature of all dynamin and septin superfamily members. this study contributes important insights into the assembly and catalytic mechanisms of irg proteins as prerequisite to understand their anti-microbial action.
