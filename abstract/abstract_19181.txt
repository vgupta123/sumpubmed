BACKGROUND
natural variation in protein output from translation in bacteria and archaea may be an organism-specific property of the ribosome. this paper adopts a systems approach to model the protein output as a measure of specific ribosome reactive properties in a ribosome-mediated translation apparatus. we use the steady-state assumption to define a transition state complex for the ribosome, coupled with mrna, trna, amino acids and reaction factors, as a subsystem that allows a focus on the completed translational output as a measure of specific properties of the ribosome.


RESULTS
in analogy to the steady-state reaction of an enzyme complex, we propose a steady-state translation complex for mrna from any gene, and derive a maximum specific translation activity, ta, as a property of the ribosomal reaction complex. ta has units of a-protein output per time per a-specific mrna. a related property of the ribosome, t˜a, has units of a-protein per time per total rna with the relationship t˜a = ρa ta, where ρa represents the fraction of total rna committed to translation output of pa from gene a message. ta as a ribosome property is analogous to kcat for a purified enzyme, and t˜a is analogous to enzyme specific activity in a crude extract.


CONCLUSIONS
analogy to an enzyme reaction complex led us to a ribosome reaction model for measuring specific translation activity of a bacterial ribosome. we propose to use this model to design experimental tests of our hypothesis that specific translation activity is a ribosomal property that is subject to natural variation and natural selection much like vmax and km for any specific enzyme.
