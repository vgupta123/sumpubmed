BACKGROUND
yellowtail  are an economically important species in japan. however, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. we constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid  panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use snps  in ests  for the dna-assisted breeding of yellowtail.


RESULTS
clonal rh cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clones were isolated after treatment with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  rads, respectively. a total of  <dig> hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse b <dig> cells. ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the  <dig> hybrid cell lines. based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected  <dig> hybrid cell lines to form an rh panel. importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an rh panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array . then,  <dig> markers containing ests and snps were mapped in the first yellowtail rh map.


CONCLUSIONS
we successfully developed a yellowtail rh panel to facilitate the localization of markers. using this, a framework rh map was constructed with  <dig> markers. this high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. moreover, in a comparison of  <dig> sequences in the rh group  <dig> , yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. we suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.
