BACKGROUND
rubber tree  laticifers are the source of natural rubber. rubber production depends on endogenous and exogenous ethylene . ap2/erf transcription factors, and especially ethylene-response factors, play a crucial role in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. this study set out to sequence transcript expressed in various tissues using next-generation sequencing and to identify ap2/erf superfamily in the rubber tree.


RESULTS
the  <dig> sequencing technique was used to produce five tissue-type transcript libraries . reads from all libraries were pooled and reassembled to improve mrna lengths and produce a global library. one hundred and seventy-three ap2/erf contigs were identified by in silico analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the conserved ap <dig> domain from the global library. the  <dig> contigs with the full ap <dig> domain were classified into three main families  and  <dig> soloist members. fifty-nine ap2/erf transcripts were found in latex. alongside the microrna <dig> already described in plants, eleven additional micrornas were predicted to inhibit hevea ap2/erf transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
hevea has a similar number of ap2/erf genes to that of other dicot species. we adapted the alignment and classification methods to data from next-generation sequencing techniques to provide reliable information. we observed several specific features for the erf family. three hbsoloist members form a group in hevea. several ap2/erf genes highly expressed in latex suggest they have a specific function in hevea. the analysis of ap2/erf transcripts in hevea presented here provides the basis for studying the molecular regulation of latex production in response to abiotic stresses and latex cell differentiation.
