BACKGROUND
the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses  are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent material in many tissues, especially in neurons. mutations in the cln <dig> gene, encoding an endoplasmic reticulum  transmembrane protein of unknown function, underlie ncl phenotypes in humans and mice. the human phenotype is characterized by epilepsy, progressive psychomotor deterioration and visual loss, while motor neuron degeneration  mice with a cln <dig> mutation show progressive motor neuron dysfunction and retinal degeneration.


RESULTS
we investigated spatial and temporal expression of cln <dig> messenger ribonucleic acid  using in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  and northern blotting. cln <dig> is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in embryonic and adult tissues. in prenatal embryos cln <dig> is most prominently expressed in the developing gastrointestinal tract, dorsal root ganglia  and brain. in postnatal brain the highest expression is in the cortex and hippocampus. expression of cln <dig> mrna in the central nervous system  was also analyzed in the hippocampal electrical kindling model of epilepsy, in which cln <dig> expression was rapidly up-regulated in hippocampal pyramidal and granular neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
expression of cln <dig> in the developing and mature brain suggests roles for cln <dig> in maturation, differentiation and supporting the survival of different neuronal populations. the relevance of cln <dig> up-regulation in hippocampal neurons of kindled mice should be further explored.
