BACKGROUND
krabbe disease, also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by the genetic deficiency of galactocerebrosidase , a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of several glycosphingolipids like psychosine and galactosylceramide. in order to investigate whether galc deficiency in krabbe disease affects adipose-derived stromal/stem cell  properties and if the ascs could be used as a source of autologous stem cell therapy for patients with krabbe disease, ascs isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue of twitcher mice  and their normal wild type littermates were cultured, expanded, and characterized for their cell morphology, surface antigen expression, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, colony forming units, growth kinetics, and immune regulatory capacities in vitro.


RESULTS
ascs from twitcher mice , when compared to ascs from normal mice , have a reduced osteogenic differentiation potential, have less self-replicating and proliferative capacity, although they have the same fibroblast morphologies and cell sizes. however, surprisingly, the twiascs demonstrated similar immune-suppressive capacities as their counterparts wtascs did when they were transwell co-cultured with macrophages in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that twitcher ascs exhibit differences in the biologic potential when compared to their counterparts from normal mice. the changes in twitcher ascs may be influenced by the galc deficiency in twitcher mice. nevertheless, none of the changes preclude the use of the twiascs for autologous applications.
