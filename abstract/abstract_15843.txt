BACKGROUND
identification of disease susceptible genes requires access to dna from numerous well-characterised subjects. archived residual dried blood spot samples from national newborn screening programs may provide dna from entire populations and medical registries the corresponding clinical information. the amount of dna available in these samples is however rarely sufficient for reliable genome-wide scans, and whole-genome amplification may thus be necessary. this study assess the quality of dna obtained from different amplification protocols by evaluating fidelity and robustness of the genotyping of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms, using the illumina infinium hd human610-quad beadchip. whole-genome amplified dna from  <dig> neonatal dried blood spot samples stored between  <dig> to  <dig> years was tested, and high-quality genomic dna from  <dig> of the same individuals was used as reference.


RESULTS
using  <dig>  mm disks from dried blood spot samples the optimal dna-extraction and amplification protocol resulted in call-rates between  <dig> % â€“  <dig> % , and conflicts with reference dna in only three per  <dig>  genotype calls.


CONCLUSIONS
whole-genome amplified dna from archived neonatal dried blood spot samples can be used for reliable genome-wide scans and is a cost-efficient alternative to collecting new samples.
