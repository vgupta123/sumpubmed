BACKGROUND
wuschel -related homeobox  protein family members play important roles in the maintenance and proliferation of the stem cell niche in the shoot apical meristem , root apical meristem , and cambium . although the roles of some woxs in meristematic cell regulation have been well studied in annual plants such as arabidopsis and rice, the expression and function of wox members in woody plant poplars has not been systematically investigated. here, we present the identification and comprehensive analysis of the expression and function of woxs in populus tomentosa.


RESULTS
a genome-wide survey identified  <dig> wox encoding sequences in the sequenced genome of populus trichocarpa . phylogenetic and gene structure analysis revealed that these  <dig> ptrwoxs fall into modern/wus, intermediate, and ancient clades, but that the wox genes in p. trichocarpa may have expanded differently from the wox genes in arabidopsis. in the p. trichocarpa genome, no wox members could be closely classified as atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  and atwox <dig>  but there were two copies of wox genes that could be classified as ptrwus, ptrwox <dig>  ptrwox <dig>  ptrwox <dig>  ptrwox8/ <dig>  and ptrwox11/ <dig>  and three copies of wox genes that could be classified as ptrwox <dig> and ptrwox <dig>  the use of primers specific for each ptrwox gene allowed the identification and cloning of  <dig> wox genes from p. tomentosa , a poplar species physiologically close to p. trichocarpa. it was found that ptowoxs and ptrwoxs shared very high amino acid sequence identity, and that ptowoxs could be classified identically to ptrwoxs. we revealed that the expression patterns of some ptowoxs were different to their arabidopsis counterparts. when ptowox5a and ptowox11/12a, as well as ptowusa and ptowox4a were ectopically expressed in transgenic hybrid poplars, the regeneration of adventitious root  was promoted, indicating a functional similarity of these four woxs in ar regeneration.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first attempt towards a systematical analysis of the function of woxs in p. tomentosa. a diversified expression, yet functional similarity of ptowoxs in ar regeneration is revealed. our findings provide useful information for further elucidation of the functions and mechanisms of woxs in the development of poplars.
