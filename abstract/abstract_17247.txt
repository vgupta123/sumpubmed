BACKGROUND
in normal adult skeletal muscle, cell turnover is very slow. however, after an acute lesion or in chronic pathological conditions, such as primary myopathies, muscle stem cells, called satellite cells, are induced to proliferate, then withdraw definitively from the cell cycle and fuse to reconstitute functional myofibers.


RESULTS
we show that maged <dig> is expressed at very low levels in normal adult muscle but is strongly induced after injury, during the early phase of myoblast differentiation. by comparing in vitro differentiation of myoblasts derived from wild-type or maged <dig> knockout mice, we observed that maged <dig> deficiency results in reduced levels of p21cip1/waf <dig>  defective cell cycle exit and impaired myotube maturation. in vivo, this defect results in delayed regeneration of injured muscle.


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate for the first time that maged <dig> is an important factor required for proper skeletal myoblast differentiation and muscle healing.
