BACKGROUND
affinity precipitation has been reported as a potential technology for the purification of proteins at the early stage of downstream processing. the technology could be achieved using reversible soluble-insoluble polymers coupled with an affinity ligand to purify proteins from large volumes of dilute solution material such as fermentation broths or plasma. in this study, a thermo-response polymer was synthesized using n-methylol acrylamide, n-isopropyl acrylamide and butyl acrylate as monomers. the molecular weight of the polymer measured by the viscosity method was  <dig>  × 104 da and the lower critical solution temperature  was  <dig> °c.the recovery of the polymer above the lcst was over  <dig> %. human serum albumin  is the most abundant protein in the human serum system, and it has important functions in the human body. high purity hsa is required in pharmaceuticals. safe and efficient purification is a crucial process during hsa production.


RESULTS
a thermo-response polymer was synthesized and l-thyroxin immobilized on the polymer as an affinity ligand to enable affinity precipitation of hsa. the lcst of the affinity polymer was  <dig> °c and the recovery was  <dig> % of its original amount after recycling three times. the optimal adsorption condition was  <dig>  m tris–hcl buffer  and the hsa adsorption capacity was  <dig>  mg/g polymer during affinity precipitation. circular dichroism spectra and a fortebio octet system were used to analyze the interactions between the affinity polymer and hsa during adsorption and desorption. the recovery of total hsa by elution with  <dig>  mol/l nascn was  <dig> %. when the affinity polymer was applied to purification of hsa from human serum, hsa could be purified to single-band purity according to sds-page.


CONCLUSIONS
a thermo-response polymer was synthesized and l-thyroxin was attached to the polymer. affinity precipitation was used to purify hsa from human serum.
