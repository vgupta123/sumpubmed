BACKGROUND
auxin and auxin signaling are involved in a series of developmental processes in plants. auxin response factors  is reported to modulate the expression of target genes by binding to auxin response elements  and influence the transcriptional activation of down-stream target genes. however, how arf genes function in flower development and fruit ripening of papaya  is largely unknown. in this study, a comprehensive characterization and expression profiling analysis of  <dig> c. papaya arf  genes was performed using the newly updated papaya reference genome data.


RESULTS
we analyzed cparf expression patterns at different developmental stages. cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig> showed the highest expression at the initial stage of flower development, but decreased during the following developmental stages. cparf <dig> expression increased during the developmental process and reached its peak level at the final stage of flower development. the expression of cparf <dig> increased significantly during the fruit ripening stages. many auxres were included in the promoters of two ethylene signaling genes  and three ethylene-synthesis-related genes , suggesting that cparfs might be involved in fruit ripening via the regulation of ethylene signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provided comprehensive information on arf family in papaya, including gene structures, chromosome locations, phylogenetic relationships, and expression patterns. the involvement of cparf gene expression changes in flower and fruit development allowed us to understand the role of arf-mediated auxin signaling in the maturation of reproductive organs in papaya.
