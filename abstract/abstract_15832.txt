BACKGROUND
polymorphisms in cytokine genes are known to influence cytokine levels, which may influence susceptibility to tuberculosis  infection and disease. differences in cytokine expression probably determine whether tb progresses, resolves, or becomes latent. in particular, the balance between the th <dig> and th <dig> cytokine responses influences the expression of disease in individuals with pulmonary tb . we performed a case–control study of  <dig> patients diagnosed with ptb,  <dig> with latent tb infection , and  <dig> healthy controls , to explore the association between polymorphisms in cytokine genes and a predisposition to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and tb disease.


RESULTS
a single-gene analysis showed a dominant association between the aa genotype or a allele at nucleotide − <dig> of the interferon γ  gene and ltbi. the a allele at nucleotide − <dig> of the interleukin  <dig>  gene was significantly more common in ptb patients than in ltbi subjects. moreover, the polymorphisms at ifn-γ − <dig> and il10 −  <dig> were associated with protein levels of ifn-γ and il- <dig>  respectively, in the ptb group. the genotype frequencies of other polymorphisms did not differ between the ptb patients, ltbi and hc subjects. furthermore, combinations of polymorphisms with ifn-γ − <dig> were associated with ltbi, whereas combinations with il10 −  <dig> were more likely associated with ptb.


CONCLUSIONS
there are positive associations between the ifn-γ − <dig> polymorphism and tb and between the il10 −  <dig> polymorphism and ltbi. our data provide genetic evidence of the multiple disease hypothesis that many cytokine genes are involved in tb susceptibility.
