BACKGROUND
plants perceive uv-b through the uv resistance locus  <dig>  photoreceptor and uvr <dig> activation leads to changes in gene expression such as those associated with uv-b acclimation and stress tolerance. albeit functionally unrelated, uvr <dig> shows some homology with rcc <dig>  proteins from non-plant organisms at the sequence level. these proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ran gtpases and bind chromatin via histones. subsequent to the revelation of this sequence homology, evidence was presented showing that uvr <dig> activity involves interaction with chromatin at the loci of some target genes through histone binding. this suggested a uvr <dig> mode-of-action intimately and directly linked with gene transcription. however, several aspects of uvr <dig> chromatin association remained undefined, namely the impact of uv-b on the process and how uvr <dig> chromatin association related to the transcription factor elongated hypocotyl  <dig> , which is important for uv-b signalling and has overlapping chromatin targets. therefore, we have investigated uvr <dig> chromatin association in further detail.


RESULTS
unlike the claims of previous studies, our chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments do not confirm uvr <dig> chromatin association. in contrast to human rcc <dig>  recombinant uvr <dig> also does not bind nucleosomes in vitro. moreover, fusion of a vp <dig> activation domain to uvr <dig> did not alter expression of proposed uvr <dig> target genes in transient gene expression assays. finally, comparison of the drosophila dmrcc <dig> and the arabidopsis uvr <dig> crystal structures revealed that critical histone- and dna-interaction residues apparent in dmrcc <dig> are not conserved in uvr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this has led us to conclude that the cellular activity of uvr <dig> likely does not involve its specific binding to chromatin at target genes.
