BACKGROUND
it is increasingly recognized that the bacteria that live in and on the human body  can play an important role in health and disease. the composition of the microbiome is potentially influenced by both internal factors  and external factors , and interspecific comparisons can aid in understanding the importance of these factors.


RESULTS
to gain insights into the relative importance of these factors on saliva microbiome diversity, we here analyze the saliva microbiomes of chimpanzees  and bonobos  from two sanctuaries in africa, and from human workers at each sanctuary. the saliva microbiomes of the two pan species are more similar to one another, and the saliva microbiomes of the two human groups are more similar to one another, than are the saliva microbiomes of human workers and apes from the same sanctuary. we also looked for the existence of a core microbiome and find no evidence for a taxon-based core saliva microbiome for homo or pan. in addition, we studied the saliva microbiome from apes from the leipzig zoo, and found an extraordinary diversity in the zoo ape saliva microbiomes that is not found in the saliva microbiomes of the sanctuary animals.


CONCLUSIONS
the greater similarity of the saliva microbiomes of the two pan species to one another, and of the two human groups to one another, are in accordance with both the phylogenetic relationships of the hosts as well as with host physiology. moreover, the results from the zoo animals suggest that novel environments can have a large impact on the microbiome, and that microbiome analyses based on captive animals should be viewed with caution as they may not reflect the microbiome of animals in the wild.
