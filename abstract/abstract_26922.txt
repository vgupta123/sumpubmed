BACKGROUND
genomic deletions are known to be widespread in many species. variant sequencing-based approaches for identifying deletions have been developed, but their powers to detect those deletions that affect medium-sized regions are limited when the sequencing coverage is low.


RESULTS
we present a cost-effective method for identifying medium-sized deletions in genomic regions with low genomic coverage. two mate-paired libraries were separately constructed from human cancerous tissue to generate paired short reads  from restriction fragments digested with a 4-base restriction enzyme. a total of  <dig> gb of paired reads  was collected, and  <dig> deletions were inferred by identifying the ditags with disorder alignments to the reference genome sequence. sanger sequencing results confirmed an overall detection accuracy of 95%. good reproducibility was verified by the deletions that were detected by both libraries.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide an approach to accurately identify medium-sized deletions in large genomes with low sequence coverage. it can be applied in studies of comparative genomics and in the identification of germline and somatic variants.
