BACKGROUND
analysis of an allelic series of point mutations in a gene, generated by n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  mutagenesis, is a valuable method for discovering the full scope of its biological function. here we present an efficient gene-driven approach for identifying enu-induced point mutations in any gene in c57bl/6j mice. the advantage of such an approach is that it allows one to select any gene of interest in the mouse genome and to go directly from dna sequence to mutant mice.


RESULTS
we produced the cryopreserved mutant mouse bank , which is an archive of dna, cdna, tissues, and sperm from  <dig>  g <dig> male offspring of enu-treated c57bl/6j males mated to untreated c57bl/6j females. each mouse in the cmmb carries a large number of random heterozygous point mutations throughout the genome. high-throughput temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis  was employed to perform a 32-mbp sequence-driven screen for mutations in  <dig> pcr amplicons from  <dig> genes in dna and/or cdna from the cmmb mice. dna sequence analysis of heteroduplex-forming amplicons identified by tgce revealed  <dig> mutations in  <dig> genes for an overall mutation frequency of  <dig> in  <dig>  mbp. all  <dig> mutations are single base pair substitutions, and nine of them  result in nonconservative amino acid substitutions. intracytoplasmic sperm injection  of cryopreserved spermatozoa into b6d2f <dig> or c57bl/6j ova was used to recover mutant mice for nine of the mutations to date.


CONCLUSIONS
the inbred c57bl/6j cmmb, together with tgce mutation screening and icsi for the recovery of mutant mice, represents a valuable gene-driven approach for the functional annotation of the mammalian genome and for the generation of mouse models of human genetic diseases. the ability of enu to induce mutations that cause various types of changes in proteins will provide additional insights into the functions of mammalian proteins that may not be detectable by knockout mutations.
