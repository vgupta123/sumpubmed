BACKGROUND
estrogen receptor α  phosphorylation is important for estrogen-dependent transcription of er-dependent genes, ligand-independent receptor activation and endocrine therapy response in breast cancer. however erα phosphorylation at the previously identified sites does not fully account for these receptor functions. to determine if additional erα phosphorylation sites exist, cos- <dig> cells expressing human erα were labeled with h3po <dig> in vivo and erα tryptic phosphopeptides were isolated to identify phosphorylation sites.


RESULTS
previously uncharacterized phosphorylation sites at serines 46/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were identified by manual edman degradation and phosphoamino acid analysis and confirmed by mutagenesis and phospho-specific antibodies. antibodies detected phosphorylation of endogenous erα in mcf- <dig>  mcf-7-lcc <dig>  and ishikawa cancer cell lines by immunoblot. mutation of ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> to alanine  resulted in ligand independent activation of erα as determined by both ere-driven reporter gene assays and endogenous ps <dig> gene expression in transiently transfected hela cells. mutation of ser-46/ <dig> or ser- <dig> to alanine markedly reduced estradiol dependent reporter activation. additionally protein kinase ck <dig> was identified as a kinase that phosphorylated erα at s <dig> and s <dig> using motif analysis, in vitro kinase assays, and incubation of cells with ck <dig> kinase inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
these novel erα phosphorylation sites represent new means for modulation of erα activity. s <dig> represents the first phosphorylation site identified in the extreme c-terminus  of a steroid receptor.
