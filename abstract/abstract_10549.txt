BACKGROUND
despite all the benefits assigned to the genetically modified plants, there are still no sufficient data available in literature concerning the possible effects on the microbial communities associated with these plants. therefore, this study was aimed at examining the effects of the genetic modifications of two transgenic maize genotypes  on their endophytic microbial communities, in comparison to the microbial community found in the near-isogenic non-transgenic maize .


RESULTS
the structure of the endophytic communities  and their composition  were evaluated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  and the construction of clone libraries, respectively. dgge analysis and the clone libraries of the bacterial community showed that genotype tc <dig> slightly differed from the other two genotypes. genotype tc <dig> showed a higher diversity within its endophytic bacterial community when compared to the other genotypes. although some bacterial genera were found in all genotypes, such as the genera burkholderia, achromobacer and stenotrophomonas, some were unique to genotype tc <dig>  moreover, otus associated with enterobacter predominated only in tc <dig> clone libraries.


CONCLUSIONS
the endophytic bacterial community of the maize genotype tc <dig> differed from the communities of the maize genotype mon <dig> and of their near-isogenic parental genotypes . the differences observed among the maize genotypes studied may be associated with insertion of the gene coding for the protein pat present only in the transgenic genotype tc <dig>
