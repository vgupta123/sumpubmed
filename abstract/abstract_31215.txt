BACKGROUND
a molecular-level understanding of the loss of curvy <dig>  gene expression  was investigated to gain insights into the mechanisms controlling cell morphogenesis and development in arabidopsis thaliana.


RESULTS
using a reverse genetic and cell biology approaches, we demonstrate that cvy <dig> is a new distorted gene with similar phenotypic characterization to previously characterized arp2/ <dig> distorted mutants. compared to the wild type, cvy <dig> mutant displayed a strong distorted trichome and altered pavement cell phenotypes. in addition, cvy <dig> null-mutant flowers earlier, grows faster and produces more siliques than wt and the arp2/ <dig> mutants. the cvy <dig> gene is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and seems to negatively regulate growth and yield in higher plants.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that curvy <dig> gene participates in several biochemical pathways in arabidopsis thaliana including  cell morphogenesis regulation through actin cytoskeleton functional networks,  the transition of vegetative to the reproductive stage and  the production of seeds.
