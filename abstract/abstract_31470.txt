BACKGROUND
while the premise that lateral gene transfer  is a dominant evolutionary force is still in considerable dispute, the case for widespread lgt in the family of aminoacyl-trna synthetases  is no longer contentious. aarss are ancient enzymes, guarding the fidelity of the genetic code. they are clustered in two structurally unrelated classes. only lysine aminoacyl-trna synthetase  is found both as a class  <dig> and a class  <dig> enzyme . remarkably, in several extant prokaryotes both classes of the enzyme coexist, a unique phenomenon that has yet to receive its due attention.


RESULTS
we applied a phylogenetic approach for determining the extent and origin of lgt in prokaryotic lysrs. reconstructing species trees for archaea and bacteria, and inferring that their last common ancestors encoded lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig>  respectively, we studied the gains and losses of both classes. a complex pattern of lgt events emerged. in specific groups of organisms lysrs <dig> was replaced by lysrs <dig> . in one occasion, within the alpha proteobacteria, a lysrs <dig> to lysrs <dig> lgt was followed by reversal to lysrs <dig>  after establishing the most likely lgt paths, we studied the possible origins of the laterally transferred genes. to this end, we reconstructed lysrs gene trees and evaluated the likely origins of the laterally transferred genes. while the sources of lysrs <dig> lgts were readily identified, those for lysrs <dig> remain, for now, uncertain. the replacement of one lysrs by another apparently transits through a stage simultaneously coding for both synthetases, probably conferring a selective advantage to the affected organisms.


CONCLUSIONS
the family of lysrss features complex lgt events. the currently available data were sufficient for identifying unambiguously the origins of lysrs <dig> but not of lysrs <dig> gene transfers. a selective advantage is suggested to organisms encoding simultaneously lysrs1- <dig>
