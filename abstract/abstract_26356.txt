BACKGROUND
rna polymerase  iii transcription is specifically elevated in a variety of cancers and is a target of regulation by a variety of tumor suppressors and oncogenes. accurate initiation by rna pol iii is dependent on tfiiib. in higher eukaryotes, two forms of tfiiib have been characterized. tfiiib required for proper initiation from gene internal rna pol iii promoters is comprised of tbp, bdp <dig>  and brf <dig>  proper initiation from gene external rna pol iii promoters requires tbp, bdp <dig>  and brf <dig>  we hypothesized that deregulation of rna polymerase iii transcription in cancer may be a consequence of altered tfiiib expression


RESULTS
here, we report:  the tfiiib subunits brf <dig> and brf <dig> are differentially expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines:  the brf <dig> and brf <dig> promoters differ in activity in cancer cell lines, and  vai transcription is universally elevated, as compared to u <dig>  in breast, prostate and cervical cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
deregulation of tfiiib-mediated transcription may be an important step in tumor development. we demonstrate that brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna are differentially expressed in a variety of cancer cells and that the brf <dig> promoter is more active than the brf <dig> promoter in all cell lines tested. we also demonstrate, that brf1-dependent vai transcription was significantly higher than the brf2-dependent u <dig> snrna transcription in all cancer cell lines tested. the data presented suggest that brf <dig> protein expression levels correlate with u <dig> promoter activity in the breast, cervical and prostate cell lines tested. interestingly, the brf <dig> protein levels did not vary considerably in hela, mcf- <dig> and du- <dig> cells, yet brf <dig> mrna expression varied considerably in breast, prostate and cervical cancer cell lines tested. thus, brf <dig> promoter activity and brf <dig> protein expression levels did not correlate well with brf1-dependent transcription levels. taken together, we reason that deregulation of brf <dig> and brf <dig> expression could be a key mechanism responsible for the observed deregulation of rna pol iii transcription in cancer cells.
