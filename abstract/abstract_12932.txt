BACKGROUND
recent global genomic analyses identified  <dig> gene sets and  <dig> core signaling pathways genetically altered in pancreatic cancer, which is a highly malignant disease. a comprehensive understanding of the genetic signatures and signaling pathways that are directly correlated to pancreatic cancer survival will help cancer researchers to develop effective multi-gene targeted, personalized therapies for the pancreatic cancer patients at different stages. a previous work that applied a lasso penalized regression method, which only considered individual genetic effects, identified  <dig> genes associated with pancreatic cancer survival.


RESULTS
in this work, we integrate pathway information into pancreatic cancer survival analysis. we introduce and apply a doubly regularized cox regression model to identify both genes and signaling pathways related to pancreatic cancer survival.


CONCLUSIONS
four signaling pathways, including ion transport, immune phagocytosis, tgfÎ² , regulation of dna-dependent transcription pathways, and  <dig> genes within the four pathways are identified and verified to be directly correlated to pancreatic cancer survival. our findings can help cancer researchers design new strategies for the early detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
