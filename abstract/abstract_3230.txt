BACKGROUND
angiogenesis is the main therapeutic mechanism of cell therapy for cardiovascular diseases, but diabetes is reported to reduce the function and number of progenitor cells. therefore, we studied the effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cell  function, and examined whether diabetes-impaired msc could be rescued by pretreatment with oxytocin.


RESULTS
mscs were isolated and cultured from diabetic  or non-diabetic  rat, and proliferation rate was compared. dm-msc was pretreated with oxytocin and compared with non-dm-msc. angiogenic capacity was estimated by tube formation and matrigel plug assay, and therapeutic efficacy was studied in rat myocardial infarction  model.

the proliferation and angiogenic activity of dm-msc were severely impaired but significantly improved by pretreatment with oxytocin. krüppel-like factor  <dig> , a critical angiogenic factor, was dramatically reduced in dm-msc and significantly restored by oxytocin. in the matrigel plug assay, vessel formation of dm-bmscs was attenuated but was recovered by oxytocin. in rat mi model, dm-msc injection did not ameliorate cardiac injury, whereas oxytocin-pretreated dm-msc improved cardiac function and reduced fibrosis.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that diabetes influenced msc by reducing angiogenic capacity and therapeutic potential. we demonstrate the striking effect of oxytocin on stem cell dysfunction and suggest the use of oxytocin as a priming reagent in autologous stem cell therapy.
