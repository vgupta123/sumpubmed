BACKGROUND
the relationship between environmental variation and induction of heat shock proteins  has been much documented under experimental conditions. however, very little is known about such induction in natural populations acclimatised to prevailing environmental conditions. furthermore, while induction of stress proteins has been well documented in response to environmental contaminants and thermal stressors, little is known about whether factors, such as extreme salinity, are also potential inductors. the black-chinned tilapia sarotherodon melanotheron is unusual for its ability to colonise estuarine environments in west africa that are characterised by extremely high salinities. the relationships between mrna levels of the  <dig> kda heat shock protein  and na+, k+-atpase1Î±  in the gills, environmental salinity, and a life-history trait  were investigated in wild populations of this species sampled from three locations in the saloum estuary, at salinities ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> psu.


RESULTS
the highest hsp <dig> and naka mrna levels, and the poorest condition factors were recorded in the most saline sampling site . the hsp <dig> and naka mrna were correlated amongst themselves and showed a direct positive correlation with environmental salinity, and a negative correlation with fish condition factor. thus, the hsp <dig> is constitutively overexpressed by s. melanotheron acclimatised to extreme hypersalinity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that, although s. melanotheron can colonise extremely saline environments, the overexpression of hsp <dig> combined with the higher naka mrna expression reveals that this represents a chronic stress. the induction of hsp <dig> was, therefore, a biomarker of chronic hyper-osmotic stress which presumably can be linked to the impaired growth performance and precocious reproduction that have been demonstrated in the populations at the extremely saline sites.
