BACKGROUND
cytokines have essential roles on intercellular communications and are effective in using a variety of intracellular pathways. among this multitude of signalling pathways, the nf-κb  and stat  families are among the most frequently investigated because of their importance. indeed, they have important role in innate and adaptive immunity. current techniques to study nf-κb and stat rely on specific elisas, western blots and – most recently described – flow cytometry; so far, investigation of such signalling pathways are most commonly performed on homogeneous cells after purification.


RESULTS
the present investigation aimed at developing a flow cytometry technique to study transcription factors in various cellular types such as mixtures of b-cells, t-lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages stimulated in steady state conditions . to achieve this goal, a two step procedure was carried out; the first one consisted of stimulating pbmcs with il1β, scd40l and/or il <dig> in such a manner that optimal stimulus was found for each cell subset ; the second step consisted of assessing confirmation and fine delineation of technical conditions by specific western-blotting for either nf-κb or stat products. we then went on to sensitize the detection technique for mixed cells using  <dig> color flow cytometry.


CONCLUSIONS
in response to il1β, or il <dig>  the levels of phosphorylated nf-κb and stat <dig> – respectively – increased significantly for all the studied cell types. in contrast, b-cells and monocytes/macrophages – but, interestingly, not t-lymphocytes  – responded significantly to scd40l by increasing phosphorylated nf-κb.
