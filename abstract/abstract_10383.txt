BACKGROUND
micrornas  have been implicated in the regulation of milk protein synthesis and development of the mammary gland . however, the specific functions of mirnas in these regulations are not clear. therefore, the elucidation of mirna expression profiles in the mg is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms of lactogenesis.


RESULTS
two mirna libraries were constructed from mg tissues taken from a lactating and a non-lactating holstein dairy cow, respectively, and the short rna sequences  in these libraries were sequenced by solexa sequencing method. the libraries included  <dig> pre-mirnas encoding for  <dig> mirnas, of which  <dig> mirnas were unique sequences and  <dig>  were expressed in both periods. a custom-designed microarray assay was then performed to compare mirna expression patterns in the mg of lactating and non-lactating dairy cows. a total of  <dig> mirnas in the lactating mg showed significant differences in expression compared to non-lactating mg . integrative mirna target prediction and network analysis approaches were employed to construct an interaction network of lactation-related mirnas and their putative targets. using a cell-based model, six mirnas  were studied to reveal their possible biological significance.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a broad view of the bovine mg mirna expression profile characteristics. eight hundred and eighty-four mirnas were identified in bovine mg. differences in types and expression levels of mirnas were observed between lactating and non-lactating bovine mg. systematic predictions aided in the identification of lactation-related mirnas, providing insight into the types of mirnas and their possible mechanisms in regulating lactation.
