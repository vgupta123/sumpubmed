BACKGROUND
rice  germplasm represents an extraordinary source of genes that control traits of agronomic importance such as drought tolerance. this diversity is the basis for the development of new cultivars better adapted to water restriction conditions, in particular for upland rice, which is grown under rainfall. the analyses of subtractive cdna libraries and differential protein expression of drought tolerant and susceptible genotypes can contribute to the understanding of the genetic control of water use efficiency in rice.


RESULTS
two subtractive libraries were constructed using cdna of drought susceptible and tolerant genotypes submitted to stress against cdna of well-watered plants. in silico analysis revealed  <dig> reads, which were grouped into  <dig> clusters. several genes expressed exclusively in the tolerant or susceptible genotypes were identified. additionally, proteome analysis of roots from stressed plants was performed and  <dig> proteins putatively associated to drought tolerance were identified by mass spectrometry.


CONCLUSIONS
several genes and proteins involved in drought-response, as well as genes with no described homologs were identified. genes exclusively expressed in the tolerant genotype were, in general, related to maintenance of turgor and cell integrity. in contrast, in the susceptible genotype, expression of genes involved in protection against cell damage was not detected. several protein families identified in the proteomic analysis were not detected in the cdna analysis. there is an indication that the mechanisms of susceptibility to drought in upland rice are similar to those of lowland varieties.
