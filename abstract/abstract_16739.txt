BACKGROUND
plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins  are encoded by multigene families and possess physiological functions that remain unclear. our objective was to characterize the complete nsltp gene family in rice and arabidopsis and to perform wheat est database mining for nsltp gene discovery.


RESULTS
in this study, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of nsltp gene families in oryza sativa and arabidopsis thaliana and identified  <dig> rice nsltp genes and  <dig> arabidopsis nsltp genes. here we present a complete overview of the genes and deduced protein features. tandem duplication repeats, which represent  <dig> out of the  <dig> rice nsltp genes and  <dig> out of the  <dig> arabidopsis nsltp genes identified, support the complexity of the nsltp gene families in these species. phylogenetic analysis revealed that rice and arabidopsis nsltps are clustered in nine different clades. in addition, we performed comparative analysis of rice nsltp genes and wheat  est sequences indexed in the unigene database. we identified  <dig> putative wheat nsltp genes, among which  <dig> were found in the 'chinese spring' cultivar. the  <dig> wheat non-redundant nsltps were organized in eight types and  <dig> subfamilies. based on the observation that seven of these clades were present in arabidopsis, rice and wheat, we conclude that the major functional diversification within the nsltp family predated the monocot/dicot divergence. in contrast, there is no type vii nsltps in arabidopsis and type ix nsltps were only identified in arabidopsis. the reason for the larger number of nsltp genes in wheat may simply be due to the hexaploid state of wheat but may also reflect extensive duplication of gene clusters as observed on rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and arabidopsis chromosome  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our current study provides fundamental information on the organization of the rice, arabidopsis and wheat nsltp gene families. the multiplicity of nsltp types provide new insights on arabidopsis, rice and wheat nsltp gene families and will strongly support further transcript profiling or functional analyses of nsltp genes. until such time as specific physiological functions are defined, it seems relevant to categorize plant nsltps on the basis of sequence similarity and/or phylogenetic clustering.
