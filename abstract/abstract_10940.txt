BACKGROUND
the abcc <dig> gene encodes an organic anion pump of the atp-binding cassette  transporter family, subclass c. the exact physiological function of abcc <dig> however is not known. here, we have isolated three novel abcc <dig> splice variants and characterized their role in the regulation of abcc <dig> gene expression.


RESULTS
two additional exons within intron  <dig> of the abcc <dig> gene were identified; one of the exons exhibits alternative donor splice sites. differential usage of these exons generates three short abcc <dig> transcripts named abcc5_sv <dig>  abcc5_sv <dig> and abcc5_sv <dig>  the variants share the first five exons with the abcc <dig> gene but differ in their 3' sequences. abcc <dig> and its novel isoforms are abundantly expressed in the human retina. splice variant abcc5_sv <dig> and abcc5_sv <dig> contain premature stop codons. while inhibition of nonsense-mediated mrna decay selectively stabilized abcc5_sv <dig> but not abcc5_sv <dig>  the amount of full length abcc <dig> mrna was simultaneously reduced. a negative regulatory effect on full length abcc <dig> expression was also observed when the abcc <dig> isoforms were silenced with sirna duplexes. finally, we show that the evolutionarily conserved abcc5_sv <dig> transcript is translated into a protein abundantly present in endothelial cells of inner retinal blood vessels and along rpe membranes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that alternative splicing of the abcc <dig> gene has functional consequences by modulating abcc <dig> gene expression. in addition, at least one abcc <dig> splice variant is protein-coding and produces a truncated abcc <dig> protein isoform with thus far unknown functional properties in the retina.
