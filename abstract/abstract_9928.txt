BACKGROUND
pspa is recognized as a major pneumococcal virulence factor and a possible vaccine candidate. the aim of this study was to analyze the pspa family and clade distribution among  <dig> spanish pneumococci representatives of dominant clones among patients with invasive disease  and nasopharyngeal healthy carriage in children .


RESULTS
pspa family  <dig> was predominant among invasive  and carriage  pneumococcal isolates. no pspa family  <dig> isolates were detected and only one strain was pspa negative. although four clonal complexes contained strains of different clades, a clear association between clade and multi locus sequence typing results was found. clades  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were associated with a wide variety of sequence types  related to multiresistant and antibiotic-susceptible worldwide-disseminated clones. clade  <dig> was associated with spain6b-st <dig>  spain14-st <dig>  colombia5-st <dig>  sweden1-st <dig>  denmark14-st <dig> and sweden1-st <dig> clones. clade  <dig> was associated with spain23f-st <dig>  spain9v-st <dig>  tennessee14-st <dig>  netherlands3-st <dig> and netherlands7f-st <dig> clones. clade  <dig> was related to sweden15a-st <dig>  netherlands18c-st <dig> and greece21-st <dig> clones. in contrast, pspa clade was not related to serotype, age or clinical origin of the isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
pspa clades were associated with genotypes. pspa family  <dig> and family  <dig> were dominant among major spanish pneumococcal clones isolated from patients with invasive disease and nasopharyngeal carriage in children.
