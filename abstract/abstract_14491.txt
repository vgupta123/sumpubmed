BACKGROUND
trichome hairs affect diverse agronomic characters such as seed weight and yield, prevent insect damage and reduce loss of water but their molecular control has not been extensively studied in soybean. several detailed models for trichome development have been proposed for arabidopsis thaliana, but their applicability to important crops such as cotton and soybean is not fully known.


RESULTS
two high throughput transcript sequencing methods, digital gene expression  tag profiling and rna-seq, were used to compare the transcriptional profiles in wild-type  and a mutant  soybean isoline that carries the dominant p <dig> allele. dge data and rna-seq data were mapped to the cdnas  predicted from the reference soybean genome, williams  <dig>  extending the model length by  <dig> bp at both ends resulted in significantly more matches of authentic dge tags indicating that many of the predicted gene models are prematurely truncated at the 5' and 3' utrs. the genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of the wild-type versus mutant line revealed a number of differentially expressed genes. one highly-expressed gene, glyma04g <dig>  in wild-type soybean was of interest as it has high homology to the cotton gene ghrdl <dig> gene that has been identified as being involved in cotton fiber initiation and is a member of the burp protein family. sequence comparison of glyma04g <dig> among williams  <dig> with our sequences derived from cs and cg isolines revealed various snps and indels including addition of one nucleotide c in the cg and insertion of ~ <dig> bp in the third exon of cs that causes a frameshift mutation and premature truncation of peptides in both lines as compared to williams  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
although not a candidate for the p <dig> locus, a burp family member  from soybean has been shown to be abundantly expressed in the cs line and very weakly expressed in the glabrous cg line. rna-seq and dge data are compared and provide experimental data on the expression of predicted soybean gene models as well as an overview of the genes expressed in young shoot tips of two closely related isolines.
