BACKGROUND
the tumour suppressor protein p <dig> protein has a core domain that binds dna and is the site for most oncogenic mutations. this domain is quite unstable compared to its homologs p <dig> and p <dig>  two key residues in the core domain of p <dig> , have been mutated in-silico, to their equivalent residues in p <dig>  and p <dig> , with subsequent increase in stability of p <dig>  computational studies have been performed to examine the basis of instability in p <dig> 


RESULTS
molecular dynamics simulations suggest that mutations in p <dig> lead to increased conformational sampling of the phase space which stabilizes the system entropically. in contrast, reverse mutations, where p <dig> and p <dig> were mutated by replacing the phe <dig> and ile <dig> by tyr and thr respectively , showed reduced conformational sampling although the change for p <dig> was much smaller than that for p <dig>  barriers to the rotation of sidechains containing aromatic rings at the core of the proteins were reduced several-fold when p <dig> was mutated; in contrast they increased when p <dig> was mutated and decreased by a small amount in p <dig>  the rate of ring flipping of a tyrosine residue at the boundary of two domains can be correlated with the change in stability, with implications for possible pathways of entry of agents that induce unfolding.


CONCLUSIONS
a double mutation at the core of the dna binding domain of p <dig> leads to enhanced stability by increasing the softness of the protein. a change from a highly directional polar interaction of the core residues tyr <dig> and thr <dig> to a non-directional apolar interaction between phe and ile respectively may enable the system to adapt more easily and thus increase its robustness to structural perturbations, giving it increased stability. this leads to enhanced conformational sampling which in turn is associated with an increased "softness" of the protein core. however the system seems to become more rigid at the periphery. the success of this methodology in reproducing the experimental trends in the stability of p <dig> suggests that it has the potential to complement structural studies for rapidly estimating changes in stability upon mutations and could be an additional tool in the design of specific classes of proteins.
