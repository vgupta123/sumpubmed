BACKGROUND
in saccharomyces cerevisiae, rad <dig> is required for multiple homologous recombination mechanisms and viability in dna replication-defective rad <dig> mutant cells. recently, four rad <dig> missense alleles were found to have distinct effects on homologous recombination that are consistent with separation-of-function mutations. the rad59-k166a allele alters an amino acid in a conserved Î±-helical domain, and, like the rad <dig> null allele diminishes association of rad <dig> with double-strand breaks. the rad59-k174a and rad59-f180a alleles alter amino acids in the same domain and have genetically similar effects on homologous recombination. the rad59-y92a allele alters a conserved amino acid in a separate domain, has genetically distinct effects on homologous recombination, and does not diminish association of rad <dig> with double-strand breaks.


RESULTS
in this study, rad <dig> mutant strains were crossed with a rad <dig> null mutant to examine the effects of the rad <dig> alleles on the link between viability, growth and the stimulation of homologous recombination in replication-defective cells. like the rad <dig> null allele, rad59-k166a was synthetically lethal in combination with rad <dig>  the rad59-k174a and rad59-f180a alleles were not synthetically lethal in combination with rad <dig>  had effects on growth that coincided with decreased ectopic gene conversion, but did not affect mutation, unequal sister-chromatid recombination, or loss of heterozygosity. the rad59-y92a allele was not synthetically lethal when combined with rad <dig>  stimulated ectopic gene conversion and heteroallelic recombination independently from rad <dig>  and was mutually epistatic with srs <dig>  unlike rad <dig>  the stimulatory effect of rad59-y92a on homologous recombination was not accompanied by effects on growth rate, cell cycle distribution, mutation, unequal sister-chromatid recombination, or loss of heterozygosity.


CONCLUSIONS
the synthetic lethality conferred by rad <dig> null and rad59-k166a alleles correlates with their inhibitory effect on association of rad <dig> with double-strand breaks, suggesting that this may be essential for rescuing replication lesions in rad <dig> mutant cells. the rad59-k174a and rad59-f180a alleles may fractionally reduce this same function, which proportionally reduced repair of replication lesions by homologous recombination and growth rate. in contrast, rad59-y92a stimulates homologous recombination, perhaps by affecting association of replication lesions with the rad <dig> recombinase. this suggests that rad <dig> influences the rescue of replication lesions by multiple recombination factors.
