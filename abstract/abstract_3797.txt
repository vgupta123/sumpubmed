BACKGROUND
single-nucleotide polymorphisms  have become the genetic markers of choice in various genetic, ecological, and evolutionary studies. genotyping-by-sequencing  is a next-generation-sequencing based method that takes advantage of reduced representation to enable high-throughput genotyping using a large number of snp markers.


RESULTS
in the present study, the distribution of non-redundant snps in the parents of  <dig> rice recombination line populations was evaluated through gbs. a total of  <dig> gigabites of nucleotide sequences conservatively provided satisfactory genotyping of rice snps. by assembling to the genomes of reference genomes of japonica nipponbare, we detected  <dig>  polymorphic snps that may be utilized for qtl/gene mapping with the recombinant inbred lines  populations derived from these parental lines. meanwhile, we identified polymorphic snps with large effects on protein-coding and mirna genes. to validate the effect of the polymorphic snps, we further investigated a snp  at the mirna binding site in the 3′-utr region of the locus os4g <dig>  which is associated with rice seed size. os4g <dig> encodes a putative cytochrome p <dig>  cyp704a <dig>  direct degradation of the 3′-utr of the cyp704a <dig> gene by a mirna  was validated by in planta mrna degradation assay. we also showed that rice seeds of longer lengths may be produced by downregulating cyp704a <dig> via rnai.


CONCLUSIONS
our study has identified the genome-wide snps by gbs of the parental varieties of ril populations and identified cyp704a <dig>  a mirna-regulated gene that is responsible for rice seed length.
