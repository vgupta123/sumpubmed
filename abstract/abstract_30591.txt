BACKGROUND
high-throughput sequencing can identify numerous potential genomic targets for microbial strain typing, but identification of the most informative combinations requires the use of computational screening tools. this paper describes novel software – automated selection of typing target subsets  - that allows intelligent selection of optimal targets for pathogen strain typing. the objective of this software is to maximise both discriminatory power, using simpson’s index of diversity , and concordance with existing typing methods, using the adjusted wallace coefficient . the program interrogates molecular typing results for panels of isolates, based on large target sets, and iteratively examines each target, one-by-one, to determine the most informative subset.


RESULTS
ausetts was evaluated using three target sets:  <dig> binary targets , used for multilocus typing of  <dig> methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  isolates;  <dig> mlva loci in  <dig> streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from the mlva database  and  <dig> mlst loci for  <dig> cryptococcus spp. isolates.

the maximum d for mrsa,  <dig> , was achieved with a subset of  <dig> targets and a d value of  <dig>  with  <dig> targets. twelve targets predicted mlst with a maximum aw of  <dig> . all  <dig> s. pneumoniae mlva targets were required to achieve maximum d of  <dig> , but  <dig> targets reached d of  <dig> . twelve targets predicted pneumococcal serotype with a maximum aw of  <dig>  and  <dig> predicted mlst with maximum aw of  <dig> . eight of the  <dig> mlst loci were sufficient to achieve the maximum d of  <dig>  for cryptococcus spp.


CONCLUSIONS
computerised analysis with ausetts allows rapid selection of the most discriminatory targets for incorporation into typing schemes. output of the program is presented in both tabular and graphical formats and the software is available for free download from http://www.cidmpublichealth.org/pages/ausetts.html.
