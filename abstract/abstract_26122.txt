BACKGROUND
while the number of newly sequenced genomes and genes is constantly increasing, elucidation of their function still is a laborious and time-consuming task. this has led to the development of a wide range of methods for predicting protein functions in silico. we report on a new method that predicts function based on a combination of information about protein interactions, orthology, and the conservation of protein networks in different species.


RESULTS
we show that aggregation of these independent sources of evidence leads to a drastic increase in number and quality of predictions when compared to baselines and other methods reported in the literature. for instance, our method generates more than  <dig>  novel protein functions for human with an estimated precision of ~76%, among which are  <dig>  new functional annotations for  <dig>  human proteins that previously had zero or only one function annotated. we also verified our predictions on a set of genes that play an important role in colorectal cancer  and could confirm more than 73% of them based on evidence in the literature.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of different methods into a single, comprehensive prediction method infers thousands of protein functions for every species included in the analysis at varying, yet always high levels of precision and very good coverage.
