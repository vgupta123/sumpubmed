BACKGROUND
krüppel-like factors  are a group of master regulators of gene expression conserved from flies to human. however, scant information is available on either the mechanisms or functional impact of the coupling of klf proteins to chromatin remodeling machines, a deterministic step in transcriptional regulation.

results and discussion
in the current study, we use genome-wide analyses of chromatin immunoprecipitation  and affymetrix-based expression profiling to gain insight into how klf <dig>  a human transcription factor involved in tumor suppression and metabolic diseases, works by coupling to three co-factor groups: the sin3-histone deacetylase system, wd40-domain containing proteins, and the hp1-histone methyltransferase system. our results reveal that klf <dig> regulates distinct gene networks involved in metabolism and growth by using single or combinatorial coupling events.

conclusion
this study, the first of its type for any klf protein, reveals that interactions with multiple chromatin systems are required for the full gene regulatory function of these proteins.
