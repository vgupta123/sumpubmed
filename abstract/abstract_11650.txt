BACKGROUND
maternal diet during pregnancy can modulate skeletal muscle development of the offspring. previous studies in pigs have indicated that a fat supplemented diet during pregnancy can improve piglet outcome, however, this is in contrast to human studies suggesting adverse effects of saturated fats during pregnancy. this study aimed to investigate the impact of a fat supplemented  “high fat” diet on skeletal muscle development in a porcine model. histological and metabolic features of the biceps femoris muscle obtained from 7-day-old piglets born to sows assigned to either a commercial  or to an isocaloric fat supplementation diet  during pregnancy were assessed.


RESULTS
offspring exposed to a maternal hf diet demonstrated enhanced muscular development, reflected by an increase in fractional growth rate, rise in myofibre cross-sectional area, increased storage of glycogen and reduction in lipid staining of myofibres. although both groups had similar intramuscular protein and triglyceride concentrations, the offspring born to hf mothers had a higher proportion of arachidonic acid  and a reduction in α-linolenic acid  compared to c group offspring. the hf group muscle also exhibited a higher ratio of c20:3n <dig> to c20:4n <dig> and total n- <dig> to n- <dig> in conjunction with up-regulation of genes associated with free fatty acid uptake and biogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a hf gestational diet accelerates the maturation of offspring biceps femoris muscle, reflected in increased glycolytic metabolism and fibre cross sectional area, differences accompanied with a potential resetting of myofibre nutrient uptake.
