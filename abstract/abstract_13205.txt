BACKGROUND
regular exercise reduces cardiovascular and metabolic disease partly through improved aerobic fitness. the determinants of exercise-induced gains in aerobic fitness in humans are not known. we have demonstrated that over  <dig> genes are activated in response to endurance-exercise training, including modulation of muscle extracellular matrix  genes. real-time quantitative pcr, which is essential for the characterization of lower abundance genes, was used to examine  <dig> ecm genes potentially relevant for endurance-exercise adaptation. twenty-four sedentary male subjects undertook six weeks of high-intensity aerobic cycle training with muscle biopsies being obtained both before and  <dig> h after training. subjects were ranked based on improvement in aerobic fitness, and two cohorts were formed : the high-responder group  while the low-responder group . ecm genes profiled included the angiopoietin  <dig> and related genes  and  <dig> , vascular endothelial growth factor  and related receptors , thrombospondin- <dig>  α2-macroglobulin and transforming growth factor β <dig> 


RESULTS
neuropilin- <dig>  and vegf receptor  <dig>  transcript abundance increased only in the hrg, whereas levels of vegf receptor  <dig> mrna actually declined in the lrg . tie <dig> and tie <dig> mrna levels were unaltered in the lrg, whereas transcription levels of both genes were increased by  <dig> -fold in the hrg . levels of thrombospondin- <dig>  and α2-macroglobulin  mrna increased substantially in the hrg. in contrast, the amount of transforming growth factor β <dig> transcript increased only in the hrg , whereas it remained unchanged in the lrg .


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate for the first time that aerobic training activates angiopoietin  <dig> and tie <dig> genes in human muscle, but only when aerobic capacity adapts to exercise-training. the fourfold-greater increase in aerobic fitness and markedly differing gene expression profile in the hrg indicates that these ecm genes may be critical for physiological adaptation to exercise in humans. in addition, we show that, without careful demonstration of physiological adaptation, conclusions derived from gene expression profiling of human skeletal muscle following exercise may be of limited value. we propose that future studies should  investigate the mechanisms that underlie the apparent link between physiological adaptation and gene expression and  use the genes profiled in this paper as candidates for population genetic studies.
