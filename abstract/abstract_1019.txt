BACKGROUND
gene ontology  provides rich information and a convenient way to study gene functional similarity, which has been successfully used in various applications. however, the existing go based similarity measurements have limited functions for only a subset of go information is considered in each measure. an appropriate integration of the existing measures to take into account more information in go is demanding.


RESULTS
we propose a novel integrative measure called intego <dig> to automatically select appropriate seed measures and then to integrate them using a metaheuristic search method. the experiment results show that intego <dig> significantly improves the performance of gene similarity in human, arabidopsis and yeast on both molecular function and biological process go categories.


CONCLUSIONS
intego <dig> computes gene-to-gene similarities more accurately than tested existing measures and has high robustness. the supplementary document and software are available at http://mlg.hit.edu.cn:8082/.
