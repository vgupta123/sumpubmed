BACKGROUND
volatile thiols largely contribute to the organoleptic characteristics and typicity of sauvignon blanc wines. among this family of odorous compounds, 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol  and 4-methyl-4-sulfanylpentan-2-one  have a major impact on wine flavor. these thiols are formed during alcoholic fermentation by the yeast from odorless, non-volatile precursors found in the berries and the must. the present study investigates the effects of vine nitrogen  status on 3sh and 4msp content in sauvignon blanc wine and on the glutathionylated and cysteinylated precursors of 3sh  in the berries and the must. this is paralleled by a rna-seq analysis of gene expression in the berries. the impact of n supply on the expression of the glutathione-s-transferase  <dig> and  <dig>  and the γ-glutamyltranspeptidase , considered as key genes in their biosynthesis, was also evaluated.


RESULTS
n supply  increased the 3sh content in wine while no effect was noticed on 4msp level. furthermore, n supply increased glut-3sh levels in grape berries at late berry ripening stages, and this effect was highly significant in must at harvest. no significant effect of n addition was noticed on cys-3sh concentration. the transcript abundance of the glutathione-s-transferases vvigst <dig> and vvigst <dig> and the γ-glutamyltranspeptidase , were similar between the control and the n <dig> treatment. new candidate genes which might be implicated in the biosynthetic pathway of 3sh precursors were identified by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing .


CONCLUSIONS
high vine n status has a positive effect on 3sh content in wine through an increase of glut-3sh levels in grape berries and must. candidate gsts and glutathione-s-conjugates type transporters involved in this stimulation were identified by rna-seq analysis.
