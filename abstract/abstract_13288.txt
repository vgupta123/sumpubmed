BACKGROUND
drought stress is one of the major causes of crop loss. wrky transcription factors, as one of the largest transcription factor families, play important roles in regulation of many plant processes, including drought stress response. however, far less information is available on drought-responsive wrky genes in wheat , one of the three staple food crops.


RESULTS
forty eight putative drought-induced wrky genes were identified from a comparison between de novo transcriptome sequencing data of wheat without or with drought treatment. tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> from wrky groups iii and ii, respectively, were selected for further investigation. subcellular localization assays revealed that tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> were localized in the nuclei in wheat mesophyll protoplasts. various abiotic stress-related cis-acting elements were observed in the promoters of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig>  quantitative real-time pcr  analysis showed that tawrky <dig> was slightly up-regulated by high-temperature and abscisic acid , and down-regulated by low-temperature. tawrky <dig> was involved in high responses to high-temperature, low-temperature, aba and jasmonic acid methylester . overexpression of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> activated several stress-related downstream genes, increased germination rates, and promoted root growth in arabidopsis under various stresses. tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines showed lower rates of water loss than tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines and wild type plants during dehydration. most importantly, tawrky <dig> transgenic lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to heat stress.


CONCLUSIONS
the functional roles highlight the importance of wrkys in stress response.
