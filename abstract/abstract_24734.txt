BACKGROUND
the major birch pollen allergen, bet v  <dig>  is a member of the ubiquitous pr- <dig> family of plant pathogenesis-related proteins. in recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low sequence similarity to bet v  <dig> was identified. in addition, determination of the bet v  <dig> structure revealed the existence of a large superfamily of structurally related proteins. in this study, we aimed to identify and classify all bet v 1-related structures from the protein data bank and all bet v 1-related sequences from the uniprot database.


RESULTS
structural comparisons of representative members of already known protein families structurally related to bet v  <dig> with all entries of the protein data bank yielded  <dig> structures with non-identical sequences. they were classified into eleven families, five of which were newly identified and not included in the structural classification of proteins database release  <dig> . the taxonomic distribution of these families extracted from the pfam protein family database showed that members of the polyketide cyclase family and the activator of hsp <dig> atpase homologue  <dig> family were distributed among all three superkingdoms, while members of some bacterial families were confined to a small number of species. comparison of ligand binding activities of bet v 1-like superfamily members revealed that their functions were related to binding and metabolism of large, hydrophobic compounds such as lipids, hormones, and antibiotics. phylogenetic relationships within the bet v  <dig> family, defined as the group of proteins with significant sequence similarity to bet v  <dig>  were determined by aligning  <dig> bet v 1-related sequences. a distance-based phylogenetic tree yielded a classification into  <dig> subfamilies, nine exclusively containing plant sequences and two subfamilies of bacterial proteins. plant sequences included the pathogenesis-related proteins  <dig>  the major latex proteins/ripening-related proteins subfamily, and polyketide cyclase-like sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
the ubiquitous distribution of bet v 1-related proteins among all superkingdoms suggests that a bet v 1-like protein was already present in the last universal common ancestor. during evolution, this protein diversified into numerous families with low sequence similarity but with a common fold that succeeded as a versatile scaffold for binding of bulky ligands.
