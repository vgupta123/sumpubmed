BACKGROUND
kainic acid -induced excitotoxicity promotes cytoplasmic calcium accumulation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic signaling, leading to hippocampal neuronal death. mitochondria play a critical role in neuroinflammation and the oxidative stress response. mitochondrial morphology is disrupted during ka-induced seizures; however, it is not clear whether mitochondrial fission or fusion factors are involved in ka-induced neuronal death.


RESULTS
we investigated the effect of mdivi- <dig>  a chemical inhibitor of the mitochondrial fission protein drp <dig>  on mitochondrial morphology and function in ka-injected mice. mdivi- <dig> pretreatment significantly reduced seizure activity and increased survival rates of ka-treated mice. mdivi- <dig> was protective against mitochondrial morphological disruption, and it reduced levels of phosphorylated drp <dig>  and parkin recruitment to mitochondria. by contrast, levels of mitochondrial fusion factors did not change. mdivi- <dig> also reduced ka-induced neuroinflammation and glial activation.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that inhibition of mitochondrial fission attenuates parkin-mediated mitochondrial degradation and protects from ka-induced hippocampal neuronal cell death.
