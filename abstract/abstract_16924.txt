BACKGROUND
members of the calcium-activated chloride channel  gene family have been suggested to possess a variety of functions including cell adhesion and tumor suppression. expression of clca family members has mostly been analyzed in non-neural tissues. here we describe the expression of mouse and human clca genes in the nervous system.


RESULTS
we show that from the six mouse clca family members only clca <dig>  clca <dig> and clca <dig> mrnas are expressed in the adult brain, predominantly in olfactory ensheathing cells. during mouse nervous system development clca1/ <dig> is more widely expressed, particularly in cranial nerves, the diencephalon and in the cerebral cortex. while human clca <dig> and clca <dig> genes are widely expressed in brain, and at particularly high levels in the optic nerve, human clca <dig>  the closest homologue of mouse clca <dig>  clca <dig> and clca <dig>  is not expressed in the brain. furthermore, we characterize the expression pattern of mouse clca1/ <dig> genes during embryonic development by in situ hybridization.


CONCLUSIONS
the data published in this article indicate that within the nervous system mouse clca1/ <dig> genes are highly expressed in the cells ensheathing cranial nerves. human clca <dig> and clca <dig> mrnas are expressed at high level in optic nerve. high level expression of clca family members in mouse and human glial cells ensheathing nerves suggests a specific role for clca proteins in the development and homeostasis of these cells.
