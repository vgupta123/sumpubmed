BACKGROUND
cytolethal distending toxin -producing escherichia coli  has been isolated from patients with gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection, and sepsis. however, the source of human infection remains unknown. in this study, we attempted to detect and isolate ctec strains from fecal specimens of healthy farm animals and characterized them phenotypically and genotypically.


RESULTS
by pcr analysis, the cdtb gene was detected in  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> and  <dig> stool specimens of healthy cattle and swine, respectively, and none from  <dig> chicken samples. subtypes of the cdtb genes  were further examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the amplicons and by type-specific pcrs for the cdt-iii and cdt-v genes. of the  <dig> cdtb gene-positive cattle samples,  <dig> cdt-i,  <dig> cdt-iii,  <dig> cdt-iv,  <dig> cdt-v and  <dig> both cdt-iii and cdt-v gene-positive strains were isolated while  <dig> cdt-ii and  <dig> cdt-v gene-positive were isolated from  <dig> cdtb positive swine samples. serotypes of some isolates were identical to those of human isolates. interestingly, a cdt-ii gene-positive strain isolated from swine was for the first time identified as escherichia albertii. phylogenetic analysis grouped  <dig> e. coli strains into  <dig> phylogroup b <dig>   <dig> b <dig>  and  <dig> d, respectively. most of the b <dig> strains harbored both lpfa
o113
 and ehaa. three and twenty-two cdt-v gene-positive strains harbored eaea and stx genes, respectively, and seven possessed cdt-v, stx and subab genes. the cnf <dig> gene, normally present in cdt-iii gene-positive strains, was also detected in cdt-v gene-positive strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that healthy cattle and swine could be the reservoir of ctec, and they could be a potential source of human infections.
