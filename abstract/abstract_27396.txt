BACKGROUND
modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a major challenge since much of the protein-dna interaction data available is static. the dynamic regulatory events miner  uses a hidden markov model-based approach to integrate this static interaction data with time series gene expression leading to models that can determine when transcription factors  activate genes and what genes they regulate. drem has been used successfully in diverse areas of biological research. however, several issues were not addressed by the original version.


RESULTS
drem  <dig>  is a comprehensive software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks that supports interactive graphical or batch mode. with version  <dig>  a set of new features that are unique in comparison with other softwares are introduced. first, we provide static interaction data for additional species. second, drem  <dig>  now accepts continuous binding values and we added a new method to utilize tf expression levels when searching for dynamic models. third, we added support for discriminative motif discovery, which is particularly powerful for species with limited experimental interaction data. finally, we improved the visualization to support the new features. combined, these changes improve the ability of drem  <dig>  to accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and make it much easier to use it for analyzing such networks in several species with varying degrees of interaction information.


CONCLUSIONS
drem  <dig>  provides a unique framework for constructing and visualizing dynamic regulatory networks. drem  <dig>  can be downloaded from: www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/drem.
