BACKGROUND
members of the amino acid/auxin permease  gene family play indispensable roles in various plant metabolism and biosynthesis processes. comprehensive analysis of aaap genes has been conducted in arabidopsis, rice, maize and poplar, but has not been reported from moso bamboo. phylogenetics, evolutionary patterns and further expression profiles analysis of the aaap gene family in moso bamboo  will increase our understanding of this important gene family.


RESULTS
in this current study, we conducted phylogenetic, gene structure, promoter region, divergence time, expression patterns and qrt-pcr analysis of the  <dig> predicted aaap genes in moso bamboo based on the availability of the moso bamboo genome sequence. we identified  <dig> putative aaap  genes, which were divided into eight distinct subfamilies based on comparative phylogenetic analysis using  <dig> full-length protein sequences, including  <dig> sequences from moso bamboo,  <dig> sequences from rice and  <dig> sequences from maize. analysis of evolutionary patterns and divergence showed that the peaaap genes have undergone a extensive duplication event approximately  <dig> million years ago  and that the split between aaap family genes in moso bamboo and rice occurred approximately  <dig> mya. the microarray analysis suggested that some genes play considerable roles in moso bamboo growth and development. we investigated the expression levels of the  <dig> aap subfamily genes under abiotic stress  by qrt-pcr to explore the potential contributions to stress response of individual peaaap genes in moso bamboo.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study suggest that peaaap genes play crucial roles in moso bamboo growth and development, especially in response to abiotic stress conditions. our comprehensive, systematic study of the aaaps gene family in moso bamboo will facilitate further analysis of the functions and evolution of aaap genes in plants.
