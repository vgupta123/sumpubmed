BACKGROUND
japanese flounder  is one of the most economically important marine species in northeast asia. information on genetic markers associated with quantitative trait loci  can be used in breeding programs to identify and select individuals carrying desired traits. commercial production of japanese flounder could be increased by developing disease-resistant fish and improving commercially important traits. previous maps have been constructed with aflp markers and a limited number of microsatellite markers. in this study, improved genetic linkage maps are presented. in contrast with previous studies, these maps were built mainly with a large number of codominant markers so they can potentially be used to analyze different families and populations.


RESULTS
sex-specific genetic linkage maps were constructed for the japanese flounder including a total of  <dig>  markers ;  <dig>  markers are linked to the male map and  <dig>  markers are linked to the female map. the lengths of the male and female maps are  <dig> . <dig> cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. based on estimations of map lengths, the female and male maps covered  <dig> and 82% of the genome, respectively. recombination ratio in the new maps revealed f:m of 1: <dig> . all linkage groups in the maps presented large differences in the location of sex-specific recombination hot-spots.


CONCLUSIONS
the improved genetic linkage maps are very useful for qtl analyses and marker-assisted selection  breeding programs for economically important traits in japanese flounder. in addition, snp flanking sequences were blasted against tetraodon nigroviridis  and danio rerio , and synteny analysis has been carried out. the ability to detect synteny among species or genera based on homology analysis of snp flanking sequences may provide opportunities to complement initial qtl experiments with candidate gene approaches from homologous chromosomal locations identified in related model organisms.
