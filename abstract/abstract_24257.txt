BACKGROUND
dna adenine methyltransferase  activity is absent in many, but not all, disease isolates of neisseria meningitidis, as a consequence of the insertion of a restriction endonuclease-encoding gene, the 'dam replacing gene'  at the dam locus. here, we report the results of a survey to assess the prevalence of drg in a globally representative panel of disease-associated meningococci.


RESULTS
of the known meningococcal hyper-invasive lineages investigated, drg was absent in all representatives of the st- <dig> and st- <dig> clonal complexes tested, but uniformly present in the representatives of the other hyper-invasive lineages present in the isolate collection . the patterns of sequence diversity observed in drg were consistent with acquisition of this gene from a source organism with a different g+c content, at some time prior to the emergence of present-day meningococcal clonal complexes, followed by spread through the meningococcal population by horizontal genetic exchange. during this spread a number of alleles have arisen by mutation and intragenic recombination.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings are consistent with the idea that possession of the drg gene may contribute to the divergence observed among meningococcal clonal complexes, but does not have a direct mechanistic involvement in virulence.
