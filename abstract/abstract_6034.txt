BACKGROUND
pakistan covers a key geographic area in human history, being both part of the indus river region that acted as one of the cradles of civilization and as a link between western eurasia and eastern asia. this region is inhabited by a number of distinct ethnic groups, the largest being the punjabi, pathan , sindhi, and baloch.


RESULTS
we analyzed the first ethnic male pathan genome by sequencing it to  <dig> -fold coverage using the illumina hiseq <dig> platform. a total of  <dig>  million single nucleotide variations  and  <dig>  million small indels were identified by comparing with the human reference genome. among the snvs,  <dig>  were novel, and  <dig>  nonsynonymous snvs were found in  <dig>  genes. snvs were annotated for health consequences and high risk diseases, as well as possible influences on drug efficacy. we confirmed that the pathan genome presented here is representative of this ethnic group by comparing it to a panel of central asians from the hgdp-ceph panels typed for ~650 k snps. the mtdna  and y haplogroup  of this individual were also typical of his geographic region of origin. finally, we reconstruct the demographic history by psmc, which highlights a recent increase in effective population size compatible with admixture between european and asian lineages expected in this geographic region.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a whole-genome sequence and analyses of an ethnic pathan from the north-west province of pakistan. it is a useful resource to understand genetic variation and human migration across the whole asian continent.
