BACKGROUND
protein inter-residue contacts play a crucial role in the determination and prediction of protein structures. previous studies on contact prediction indicate that although template-based consensus methods outperform sequence-based methods on targets with typical templates, such consensus methods perform poorly on new fold targets. however, we find out that even for new fold targets, the models generated by threading programs can contain many true contacts. the challenge is how to identify them.


RESULTS
in this paper, we develop an integer linear programming model for consensus contact prediction. in contrast to the simple majority voting method assuming that all the individual servers are equally important and independent, the newly developed method evaluates their correlation by using maximum likelihood estimation and extracts independent latent servers from them by using principal component analysis. an integer linear programming method is then applied to assign a weight to each latent server to maximize the difference between true contacts and false ones. the proposed method is tested on the casp <dig> data set. if the top l/ <dig> predicted contacts are evaluated where l is the protein size, the average accuracy is 73%, which is much higher than that of any previously reported study. moreover, if only the  <dig> new fold casp <dig> targets are considered, our method achieves an average accuracy of 37%, which is much better than that of the majority voting method, svm-lomets, svm-seq, and sam-t <dig>  these methods demonstrate an average accuracy of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
reducing server correlation and optimally combining independent latent servers show a significant improvement over the traditional consensus methods. this approach can hopefully provide a powerful tool for protein structure refinement and prediction use.
