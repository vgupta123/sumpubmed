BACKGROUND
while most gamma proteobacteria have a single circular chromosome, vibrionales have two circular chromosomes. horizontal gene transfer is common among vibrios, and in light of this genetic mobility, it is an open question to what extent the two chromosomes themselves share a common history since their formation.


RESULTS
single copy genes from each chromosome  were identified from  <dig> sequenced vibrionales genomes and their phylogenetic comparison suggests consistent phylogenies for each chromosome. additionally, study of the gene organization and phylogeny of the respective origins of replication confirmed the shared history.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, while elements within the chromosomes may have experienced significant genetic mobility, the backbones share a common history. this allows conclusions based on multilocus sequence analysis  for one chromosome to be applied equally to both chromosomes.
