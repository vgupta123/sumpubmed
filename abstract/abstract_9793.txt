BACKGROUND
atp binding cassette  systems are responsible for the import and export of a wide variety of molecules across cell membranes and comprise one of largest protein superfamilies found in prokarya, eukarya and archea. abc systems play important roles in bacterial lifestyle, virulence and survival. in this study, an inventory of the abc systems of burkholderia pseudomallei strain k <dig> and burkholderia mallei strain atcc  <dig> has been compiled using bioinformatic techniques.


RESULTS
the abc systems in the genomes of b. pseudomallei and b. mallei have been reannotated and subsequently compared. differences in the number and types of encoded abc systems in belonging to these organisms have been identified. for example, abc systems involved in iron acquisition appear to be correlated with differences in genome size and lifestyles between these two closely related organisms.


CONCLUSIONS
the availability of complete inventories of the abc systems in b. pseudomallei and b. mallei has enabled a more detailed comparison of the encoded proteins in this family. this has resulted in the identification of abc systems which may play key roles in the different lifestyles and pathogenic properties of these two bacteria. this information has the potential to be exploited for improved clinical identification of these organisms as well as in the development of new vaccines and therapeutics targeted against the diseases caused by these organisms.
