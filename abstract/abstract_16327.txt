BACKGROUND
anesthetic-induced cns depression is thought to involve reduction of glutamate release from nerve terminals. recent studies suggest that isoflurane reduces glutamate release by block of na channels. to further investigate this question we examined the actions of isoflurane, ttx, extracellular ca2+, cnqx and stimulus voltage  on glutamate-mediated transmission at hippocampal excitatory synapses. epsps were recorded from ca <dig> neurons in rat hippocampal brain slices in response to schaffer-collateral fiber stimulation.


RESULTS
isoflurane  reversibly depressed epsp amplitudes by ~60% while facilitation increased ~20%. consistent with previous studies, these results indicate a presynaptic site of action that involves reduced excitation-release coupling. epsps were depressed to comparable levels by ttx  or lowered stim, but facilitation was not changed, indicating a simple failure of axonal conduction. similarly, partial antagonism of postsynaptic glutamate receptors with cnqx  depressed epsp amplitudes with no change in facilitation. however, epsp depression by low external ca2+  was accompanied by an increase in facilitation comparable to isoflurane. isoflurane depression of epsp amplitudes could also be partly reversed by high external ca2+  that also decreased facilitation. isoflurane or low ca2+ markedly reduced the slopes of fiber volley -epsp input-output curves, consistent with little or no effect on fvs. by contrast, ttx didn't alter the fv-epsp curve slope, indicating that epsp depression resulted from fv depression. fvs were remarkably resistant to isoflurane. somatic spike currents were unaffected by  <dig> Î¼m  isoflurane as well. the ec <dig> for isoflurane depression of fvs was ~ <dig>  mm .


CONCLUSIONS
isoflurane appears to depress ca <dig> synapses at presynaptic sites downstream from na channels, as evident by the increased facilitation that accompanies epsp depression. fiber volleys did not exhibit depression by isoflurane, as has been reported for other brain regions.
