BACKGROUND
a clonal cell line that combines both stable hepatic function and proliferation capacity is desirable for in vitro applications that depend on hepatic function, such as pharmacological or toxicological assays and bioartificial liver systems. here we describe the generation and characterization of a clonal human cell line for in vitro hepatocyte applications.


RESULTS
cell clones derived from human fetal liver cells were immortalized by over-expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase. the resulting cell line, cbal <dig>  displayed hepatic functionality similar to the parental cells prior to immortalization, and did not grow in soft agar. cell line cbal <dig> expressed markers of immature hepatocytes, like glutathione s transferase and cytokeratin  <dig>  as well as progenitor cell marker cd <dig> and was negative for lidocaine elimination. on the other hand, the cbal <dig> cells produced urea, albumin and cytokeratin  <dig> and eliminated galactose. in contrast to hepatic cell lines nknt- <dig> and hepg <dig>  all hepatic functions were expressed in cbal <dig>  although there was considerable variation in their levels compared with primary mature hepatocytes. when transplanted in the spleen of immunodeficient mice, cbal <dig> engrafted into the liver and partly differentiated into hepatocytes showing expression of human albumin and carbamoylphosphate synthetase without signs of cell fusion.


CONCLUSIONS
this novel liver cell line has the potential to differentiate into mature hepatocytes to be used for in vitro hepatocyte applications.
