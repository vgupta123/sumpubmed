BACKGROUND
expressed sequence tag -based markers are preferred because they reflect transcribed portions of the genome. we report the development of simple sequence repeat  and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers derived from transcriptome sequences in cabbage, and their utility for map construction.


RESULTS
transcriptome sequences were obtained from two cabbage parental lines, c <dig> and c <dig>  which are susceptible and resistant to black rot disease, respectively, using the  <dig> platform. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads were generated and clustered into  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes, respectively. we identified  <dig>  ssr motifs from the unigenes of the black rot-resistant parent c <dig>  trinucleotide motifs were the most abundant  among the repeat motifs. in addition,  <dig>  snps were detected between the two parental lines. a total of  <dig> est-based ssr and  <dig> snp-based dcaps markers were designed and used for detection of polymorphism between parents. using an f <dig> population, we built a genetic map comprising  <dig> loci, and consisting of  <dig> est-based ssrs,  <dig> snp-based dcaps,  <dig> ibp markers derived from b. rapa genome sequence and  <dig> public ssrs, distributed on nine linkage groups spanning a total of  <dig> .88 cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci. the parental lines used in this study are elite breeding lines with little genetic diversity; therefore, the markers that mapped in our genetic map will have broad spectrum utility.


CONCLUSIONS
this genetic map provides additional genetic information to the existing b. oleracea map. moreover, the new set of est-based ssr and dcaps markers developed herein is a valuable resource for genetic studies and will facilitate cabbage breeding. additionally, this study demonstrates the usefulness of ngs transcriptomes for the development of genetic maps even with little genetic diversity in the mapping population.
