BACKGROUND
the facultative, intracellular bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a serious infectious disease of humans and animals. we identified and categorized tandem repeat arrays and their distribution throughout the genome of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> in order to develop a genetic typing method for b. pseudomallei. we then screened  <dig> of the potentially polymorphic loci across a diverse panel of  <dig> isolates including b. pseudomallei, b. mallei and b. thailandensis in order to identify loci with varying degrees of polymorphism. a subset of these tandem repeat arrays were subsequently developed into a multiple-locus vntr analysis to examine  <dig> b. pseudomallei and  <dig> b. mallei isolates from around the world, as well as  <dig> lineages from a serial transfer experiment encompassing ~ <dig>  generations.


RESULTS
b. pseudomallei contains a preponderance of tandem repeat loci throughout its genome, many of which are duplicated elsewhere in the genome. the majority of these loci are composed of repeat motif lengths of  <dig> to  <dig> bp with  <dig> to  <dig> repeat units and are predominately located in intergenic regions of the genome. across geographically diverse b. pseudomallei and b.mallei isolates, the  <dig> vntr loci displayed between  <dig> and  <dig> alleles, with nei's diversity values ranging from  <dig>  and  <dig> . mutation rates for these loci are comparable  to that of the most diverse tandemly repeated regions found in other less diverse bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
the frequency, location and duplicate nature of tandemly repeated regions within the b. pseudomallei genome indicate that these tandem repeat regions may play a role in generating and maintaining adaptive genomic variation. multiple-locus vntr analysis revealed extensive diversity within the global isolate set containing b. pseudomallei and b. mallei, and it detected genotypic differences within clonal lineages of both species that were identical using previous typing methods. given the health threat to humans and livestock and the potential for b. pseudomallei to be released intentionally, mlva could prove to be an important tool for fine-scale epidemiological or forensic tracking of this increasingly important environmental pathogen.
