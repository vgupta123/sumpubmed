BACKGROUND
amino acid substitutions in the target enzyme erg11p of azole antifungals contribute to clinically-relevant azole resistance in candida albicans. a simple molecular method for rapid detection of erg <dig> gene mutations would be an advantage as a screening tool to identify potentially-resistant strains and to track their movement. to complement dna sequencing, we developed a padlock probe and rolling circle amplification -based method to detect a series of mutations in the c. albicans erg <dig> gene using "reference" azole-resistant isolates with known mutations. the method was then used to estimate the frequency of erg <dig> mutations and their type in  <dig> australian clinical c. albicans isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and in  <dig> fluconazole-susceptible isolates. rca results were compared dna sequencing.


RESULTS
the rca assay correctly identified all erg <dig> mutations in eight "reference" c. albicans isolates. when applied to  <dig> test strains, the rca method showed 100% agreement with dna sequencing where an erg <dig> mutation-specific probe was used. of  <dig> different missense mutations detected by sequencing in  <dig> of  <dig>  isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility,  <dig> were detected by rca. five missense mutations were detected by both methods in  <dig> of  <dig>  fluconazole-susceptible strains. dna sequencing revealed that mutations in non-susceptible isolates were all due to homozygous nucleotide changes. with the exception of the mutations leading to amino acid substitution e266d, those in fluconazole-susceptible strains were heterozygous. amino acid substitutions common to both sets of isolates were d116e, e266d, k128t, v437i and v488i. substitutions unique to isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility were g <dig> s , g448e , g307s , k143r  and y123h, s405f and r467k . dna sequencing revealed a novel substitution, g450v, in one isolate.


CONCLUSIONS
the sensitive rca assay described here is a simple, robust and rapid  method for the detection of erg <dig> polymorphisms. it showed excellent concordance with erg <dig> sequencing and is a potentially valuable tool to track the emergence and spread of azole-resistant c. albicans and to study the epidemiology of erg <dig> mutations. the rca method is applicable to the study of azole resistance in other fungi.
