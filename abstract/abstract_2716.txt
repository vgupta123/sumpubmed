BACKGROUND
hs-1-associated protein x- <dig> , is a multifunctional protein that has sequence homology to bcl- <dig> family members. hax- <dig> knockout animals reveal that it plays an essential protective role in the central nervous system against various stresses. homozygous mutations in the hax- <dig> gene are associated with autosomal recessive forms of severe congenital neutropenia along with neurological symptoms. the protein level of hax- <dig> has been shown to be regulated by cellular protease cleavage or by transcriptional suppression upon stimulation.


RESULTS
here, we report a novel post-translational mechanism for regulation of hax- <dig> levels in mammalian cells. we identified that pest sequence, a sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine and threonine, is responsible for its poly-ubiquitination and rapid degradation. hax- <dig> is conjugated by k48-linked ubiquitin chains and undergoes a fast turnover by the proteasome system. a deletion mutant of hax- <dig> that lacks the pest sequence is more resistant to the proteasomal degradation and exerts more protective effects against apoptotic stimuli than wild type hax- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that hax- <dig> is a short-lived protein and that its pest sequence dependent fast degradation by the proteasome may contribute to the rapid cellular responses upon different stimulations.
