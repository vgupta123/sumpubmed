BACKGROUND
retinoid-inducible gene  <dig> , also known as tazarotene-induced gene  <dig> or retinoic-acid receptor responder  <dig>  is a growth regulator, which induces apoptosis and differentiation. rig <dig> is classified into the nc protein family. this study investigated functional domains and critical amino acids associated with rig1-mediated cell death and apoptosis.


RESULTS
using enhanced green fluorescence protein -tagged rig <dig> variants, rig <dig> proteins with deletion at the nc domain significantly decreased cell death induced by rig <dig>  and fusion variants containing only the nc domain significantly induced apoptosis of htta cervical cancer cells. the egfp-rig1-induced apoptosis was significantly decreased in cells expressing n112c <dig> motif double-  or triple-  mutated rig <dig> variants. using dodecapeptides, nuclear localization and profound cell death was observed in htta cells expressing wild type rig1111– <dig> or leu121-mutated rig1111–123:l→ c peptide, but peptides double- or triple-mutated at the nc motif alone, rig1111–123:nc→fg or rig1111–123:ncr→fge, were cytoplasmically localized and did not induce apoptosis. the rig1111– <dig> also induced apoptosis of a <dig> melanoma cells but not normal human fibroblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
the nc domain, especially the nc motif, plays the major role in rig1-mediated pro-apoptotic activity. the rig1111– <dig> dodecapeptide exhibited strong pro-apoptotic activity and has potential as an anticancer drug.
