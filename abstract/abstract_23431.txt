BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains a serious human health problem that affects millions of people in the world. understanding the biology of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is essential for tackling this devastating disease. mtb possesses a very complex cell envelope containing a variety of lipid components that participate in the establishment of the infection. we have previously demonstrated that di-o-acylated trehalose , a non-covalently linked cell wall glycolipid, inhibits the proliferation of t lymphocytes and the production of cytokines.


RESULTS
in this work we show that dat and the closely related tri-o-acylated trehalose  inhibits nitric oxide  production and the inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression in macrophages .


CONCLUSIONS
these findings show that dat and tat are cell-wall located virulence factors that downregulate an important effector of the immune response against mycobacteria.
