BACKGROUND
to enhance myocardial angiogenic gene expression, a novel gene delivery strategy was tested. direct intramyocardial injection of an angiogenic gene with microbubbles and insonation were applied in a dog animal model. dogs received one of the four different treatments in conjunction with either the enhanced green fluorescence protein  gene or the hepatocyte growth factor  gene: gene with microbubbles  and ultrasound ; gene with us; gene with mb; or the gene alone.


RESULTS
distribution of mb and the gene in the myocardium was visualized during the experiment. compared with the egfp gene group, an average  <dig> -fold enhancement in gene expression was achieved in the egfp+mb/us group . compared with the hgf gene group, an average  <dig> -fold enhancement in gene expression was achieved in the hgf+mb/us group . in addition, capillary density increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> /mm <dig> in the hgf gene group to  <dig>  ±  <dig> /mm <dig> in hgf+mb/us group .


CONCLUSIONS
thus, direct intramyocardial injection of an angiogenic gene in conjunction with microbubbles plus insonation synergistically enhances angiogenesis. this method offers an observable gene delivery procedure with enhanced expression efficiency of the delivered gene.
