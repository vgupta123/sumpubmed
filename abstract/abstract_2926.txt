BACKGROUND
there are not reported regarding the protocols for obtaining platelet concentrates  in cats for medical purposes. the objectives of this study were: 1) to describe a manual method for producing two kinds of pc in cats , 2) to describe the cellular population of the pc, 3) to measure and compare the effect of calcium gluconate  and bovine thrombin  on the temporal release of transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  and platelet-derived growth factor type bb  at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-activation and 4) to establish correlations between the cellular population of both pcs and the concentration of growth factors . blood samples were taken from  <dig> cats for complete blood count, plasma collection and pc preparation. the pc were arbitrarily divided into two fractions, specifically, pc-a  and pc-b .


RESULTS
the platelet counts were significantly different  between the pc and whole blood but not between the pc fractions. the tgf-Î² <dig> concentration efficiencies for pc-a and pc-b activated with cg were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and activated with bt were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the pdgf-bb concentration efficiencies for pc-a and pc-b activated with cg were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and activated with bt were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the temporal release of gfs showed no statistically significant difference  between the activating substances at the time or for any pc fraction.


CONCLUSIONS
whatever the activation means, these preparations of cat pc provide significant concentrations of platelets and gfs for possible clinical or experimental use.
