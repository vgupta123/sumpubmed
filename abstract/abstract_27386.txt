BACKGROUND
the application of high throughput approaches to the identification of protein interactions has offered for the first time a glimpse of the global interactome of some model organisms. until now, however, such genome-wide approaches have not been applied to the human proteome.


RESULTS
in order to fill this gap we have assembled an inferred human protein interaction network where interactions discovered in model organisms are mapped onto the corresponding human orthologs. in addition to a stringent assignment to orthology classes based on the inparanoid algorithm, we have implemented a string matching algorithm to filter out orthology assignments of proteins whose global domain organization is not conserved. finally, we have assessed the accuracy of our own, and related, inferred networks by benchmarking them against i) an assembled experimental interactome, ii) a network derived by mining of the scientific literature and iii) by measuring the enrichment of interacting protein pairs sharing common gene ontology annotation.


CONCLUSIONS
the resulting networks are named homomint and homomint_filtered, the latter being based on the orthology table filtered by the domain architecture matching algorithm. they contains  <dig> and  <dig> interactions respectively and can be analyzed and viewed in the context of the experimentally verified interactions between human proteins stored in the mint database. homomint is constantly updated to take into account the growing information in the mint database.
