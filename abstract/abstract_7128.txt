BACKGROUND
prosopis alba  is an important native tree adapted to arid and semiarid regions of north-western argentina which is of great value as multipurpose species. despite its importance, the genomic resources currently available for the entire prosopis genus are still limited. here we describe the development of a leaf transcriptome and the identification of new molecular markers that could support functional genetic studies in natural and domesticated populations of this genus.


RESULTS
next generation dna pyrosequencing technology applied to p. alba transcripts produced a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads with an average length of  <dig> bp. de novo assembling generated a set of  <dig>  isotigs and  <dig>  non-assembled sequences  with an average of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively. a total of  <dig>  unique singletons were identified after clustering natural and artificial duplicates from pyrosequencing reads.

regarding the non-redundant sequences or unigenes,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  were successfully annotated with gene ontology terms. moreover, simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  were searched, resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers, respectively, throughout the genome. for the validation of the the predicted ssr markers, a subset of  <dig> ssrs selected through functional annotation evidence was successfully amplified from six dna samples of seedlings. from this analysis,  <dig> of these  <dig> ssrs were identified as polymorphic. additionally, another set of  <dig> nuclear polymorphic ssrs were determined in silico, of which 50% have the probability of being effectively polymorphic.


CONCLUSIONS
this study generated a successful global analysis of the p. alba leaf transcriptome after bioinformatic and wet laboratory validations of rna-seq data.

the limited set of molecular markers currently available will be significantly increased with the thousands of new markers that were identified in this study. this information will strongly contribute to genomics resources for p. alba functional analysis and genetics. finally, it will also potentially contribute to the development of population-based genome studies in the genera.
