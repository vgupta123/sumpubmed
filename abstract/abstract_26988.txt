BACKGROUND
the neuroprotective effect of xenon has been demonstrated for glutamatergic neurons. in the present study it is investigated if dopaminergic neurons, i.e. nerve-growth-factor differentiated pc- <dig> cells, are protected as well against hypoxia-induced cell damage in the presence of xenon.


RESULTS
pheochromocytoma cells differentiated by addition of nerve growth factor were placed in a n2-saturated atmosphere, a treatment that induced release of dopamine, reaching a maximum after  <dig> min. by determining extracellular lactate dehydrogenase concentration as marker for concomitant cellular damage, a substantial increase of enzymatic activity was found for n2-treated cells. replacement of n <dig> by xenon in such a hypoxic atmosphere resulted in complete protection against cellular damage and prevention of hypoxia-induced dopamine release. intracellular buffering of ca2+ using the ca-chelator  <dig>  2-bisethane-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis ester  reduced the neuroprotective effect of xenon indicating the essential participation of intracellular ca2+-ions in the process of xenon-induced neuroprotection.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented demonstrate the outstanding property of xenon to protect neuron-like cells in a hypoxic situation.
