BACKGROUND
the archaeal exosome is formed by a hexameric rnase ph ring and three rna binding subunits and has been shown to bind and degrade rna in vitro. despite extensive studies on the eukaryotic exosome and on the proteins interacting with this complex, little information is yet available on the identification and function of archaeal exosome regulatory factors.


RESULTS
here, we show that the proteins pasbds and panip <dig>  which bind preferentially to poly-a and au-rich rnas, respectively, affect the pyrococcus abyssi exosome activity in vitro. pasbds inhibits slightly degradation of a poly-ra substrate, while panip <dig> strongly inhibits the degradation of poly-a and poly-au by the exosome. the exosome inhibition by panip <dig> appears to depend at least partially on its interaction with rna, since mutants of panip <dig> that no longer bind rna, inhibit the exosome less strongly. we also show that fitc-labeled panip <dig> associates with the exosome in the absence of substrate rna.


CONCLUSIONS
given the high structural homology between the archaeal and eukaryotic proteins, the effect of archaeal nip <dig> and sbds on the exosome provides a model for an evolutionarily conserved exosome control mechanism.
