BACKGROUND
tyrosine kinase  <dig> , a central component of janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription  signaling, has major effects on innate immunity and inflammation. mice lacking tyk <dig> are resistant to endotoxin shock induced by lipopolysaccharide , and tyk <dig> deficient macrophages fail to efficiently induce interferon α/β after lps treatment. however, how tyk <dig> globally regulates transcription of downstream target genes remains unknown. here we examine the regulatory role of tyk <dig> in basal and inflammatory transcription by comparing gene expression profiles of peritoneal macrophages from tyk <dig> mutant and wildtype control mice that were either kept untreated or exposed to lps for six hours.


RESULTS
untreated tyk2-deficient macrophages exhibited reduced expression of immune response genes relative to wildtype, in particular those that contain interferon response elements , whereas metabolic genes showed higher expression. upon lps challenge, ifn-inducible genes  were strongly upregulated in both tyk <dig> mutant and wildtype cells and reached similar expression levels. in contrast, metabolic gene expression was strongly decreased in wildtype cells upon lps treatment, while in tyk <dig> mutant cells the expression of these genes remained relatively unchanged, which exaggerated differences already present at the basal level. we also identified several 5'ur transcription factor binding-sites and 3'utr regulatory elements that were differentially induced between tyk <dig> deficient and wildtype macrophages and that have not previously been implicated in immunity.


CONCLUSIONS
although tyk <dig> is essential for the full lps response, its function is mainly required for baseline expression but not lps-induced upregulation of ifn-inducible genes. moreover, tyk <dig> function is critical for the downregulation of metabolic genes upon immune challenge, in particular genes involved in lipid metabolism. together, our findings suggest an important regulatory role for tyk <dig> in modulating the relationship between immunity and metabolism.
