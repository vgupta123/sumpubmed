BACKGROUND
an essential first step in the genomic characterisation of a new species, in this case atlantic halibut , is the generation of est information. this forms the basis for subsequent microarray design, snp detection and the placement of novel markers on genetic linkage maps.


RESULTS
normalised directional cdna libraries were constructed from five different larval stages  and eight different adult tissues . recombination efficiency of the libraries ranged from 91â€“98% and insert size averaged  <dig>  kb. approximately  <dig> clones were sequenced from the 5'-end of each library and after trimming,  <dig> good sequences were obtained. redundancy within each library was very low and assembly of the entire est collection into contigs resulted in  <dig> unique sequences of which  <dig>  had matches in genbank. removal of ests and contigs that originated from bacteria or food organisms resulted in a total of  <dig> unique halibut sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
a unigene collection of  <dig> functionally annotated ests has been assembled from atlantic halibut. these have been incorporated into a publicly available, searchable database and form the basis for an oligonucleotide microarray that can be used as a tool to study gene expression in this economically important aquacultured fish.
