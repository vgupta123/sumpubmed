BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae is an important opportunistic pathogen associated with nosocomial and community-acquired infections. a wide repertoire of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes is present in k. pneumoniae genomes, which can constitute extra challenges in the treatment of infections caused by some strains. k. pneumoniae kp <dig> is a multidrug-resistant strain responsible for causing a large nosocomial outbreak in a teaching hospital located in southern brazil. kp <dig> produces k. pneumoniae carbapenemase  but is unrelated to isolates belonging to st  <dig> and st  <dig>  the main clusters associated with the worldwide dissemination of kpc-producing k. pneumoniae. in this report, we perform a genomic comparison between kp <dig> and each of the following three k. pneumoniae genomes: mgh  <dig>  ntuh-k <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
we have completely determined the genome of k. pneumoniae kp <dig>  which comprises one chromosome  and six plasmids . several virulence and resistance determinants were identified in strain kp <dig>  specifically, we detected genes coding for six beta-lactamases , eight adhesin-related gene clusters, including regions coding for types  <dig>  and  <dig>  fimbrial adhesins. the rmtg plasmidial 16s rrna methyltransferase gene was also detected, as well as efflux pumps belonging to five different families. mutations upstream the ompk <dig> porin-encoding gene were evidenced, possibly affecting its expression. snps analysis relative to the compared strains revealed  <dig> mutations falling within cdss related to drug resistance which could also influence the kp <dig> lifestyle. finally, the genetic apparatus for synthesis of the yersiniabactin siderophore was identified within a plasticity region. chromosomal architectural analysis allowed for the detection of  <dig> regions of difference in kp <dig> relative to the compared strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the plasticity occurring at many hierarchical levels  may play a role on the lifestyle of k. pneumoniae kp <dig> and underlie the importance of whole-genome sequencing to study bacterial pathogens. the general chromosomal structure was somewhat conserved among the compared bacteria, and recombination events with consequent gain/loss of genomic segments appears to be driving the evolution of these strains.
