BACKGROUND
in the model single-cell c <dig> plant bienertia sinuspersici, chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded photosynthetic enzymes, characteristically confined to either bundle sheath or mesophyll cells in kranz-type c <dig> leaves, all occur together within individual leaf chlorenchyma cells. intracellular separation of dimorphic chloroplasts and key enzymes within central and peripheral compartments allow for c <dig> carbon fixation analogous to nad-malic enzyme  kranz type species. several methods were used to investigate dimorphic chloroplast differentiation in b. sinuspersici.


RESULTS
confocal analysis revealed that rubisco-containing chloroplasts in the central compartment chloroplasts  contained more photosystem ii proteins than the peripheral compartment chloroplasts  which contain pyruvate,pi dikinase , a pattern analogous to the cell type-specific chloroplasts of many kranz type nad-me species. transient expression analysis using gfp fusion constructs containing various lengths of a b. sinuspersici rubisco small subunit  gene and the transit peptide of ppdk revealed that their import was not specific to either chloroplast type. immunolocalization showed the rbcl-specific mrna binding protein rlsb to be selectively localized to the ccc in b. sinuspersici, and to rubisco-containing bs chloroplasts in the closely related kranz species suaeda taxifolia. comparative fluorescence analyses were made using redox-sensitive and insensitive gfp forms, as well comparative staining using the peroxidase indicator  <dig> -diaminobenzidine , which demonstrated differences in stromal redox potential, with the ccc having a more negative potential than the pcc.


CONCLUSIONS
both ccc rlsb localization and the differential chloroplast redox state are suggested to have a role in post-transcriptional rbcl expression.
