BACKGROUND
extracellular signal-regulated kinase , one member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase  family, has been suggested to regulate a diverse array of cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, survival, as well as neuronal plasticity. recent evidence indicates a role for erks in nociceptive processing in both dorsal root ganglion  and spinal cord. however, little literature has been reported to examine the differential distribution and activation of erk isoforms, erk <dig> and erk <dig>  at different levels of pain-related pathways under both normal and pain states. in the present study, quantitative blot immunolabeling technique was used to determine the spatial and temporal expression of erk <dig> and erk <dig>  as well as their activated forms, in the spinal cord, primary somatosensory cortex , and hippocampus under normal, transient pain and persistent pain states.


RESULTS
in na√Øve rats, we detected regional differences in total expression of erk <dig> and erk <dig> across different areas. in the spinal cord, erk <dig> was expressed more abundantly than erk <dig>  while in the si area of cortex and hippocampus, there was a larger amount of erk <dig> than erk <dig>  moreover, phosphorylated erk <dig> , not phosphorylated erk <dig> , was normally expressed with a high level in the si area and hippocampus, but both perk <dig> and perk <dig> were barely detectable in normal spinal cord. intraplantar saline or bee venom injection, mimicking transient or persistent pain respectively, can equally initiate an intense and long-lasting activation of erks in all three areas examined. however, isoform-dependent differences existed among these areas, that is, perk <dig> exhibited stronger response than perk <dig> in the spinal cord, whereas erk <dig> was more remarkably activated than erk <dig> in the s <dig> area and hippocampus.


CONCLUSIONS
taken these results together, we conclude that:  under normal state, while erk immunoreactivity is broadly distributed in the rat central nervous system  in general, the relative abundance of erk <dig> and erk <dig> differs greatly among specific regions;  under pain state, either erk <dig> or erk <dig> can be effectively phosphorylated with a long-term duration by both transient and persistent pain, but their response patterns differ from each other across distinct regions;  the long-lasting erks activation induced by bee venom injection is highly correlated with our previous behavioral, electrophysiological, morphological and pharmacological observations, lending further support to the functional importance of erks-mediated signaling pathways in the processing of negative consequences of pain associated with sensory, emotional and cognitive dimensions.
