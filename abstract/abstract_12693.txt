BACKGROUND
metabolite profiling, the simultaneous quantification of multiple metabolites in an experiment, is becoming increasingly popular, particularly with the rise of systems-level biology. the workhorse in this field is gas-chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry . the high-throughput of this technology coupled with a demand for large experiments has led to data pre-processing, i.e. the quantification of metabolites across samples, becoming a major bottleneck. existing software has several limitations, including restricted maximum sample size, systematic errors and low flexibility. however, the biggest limitation is that the resulting data usually require extensive hand-curation, which is subjective and can typically take several days to weeks.


RESULTS
we introduce the targetsearch package, an open source tool which is a flexible and accurate method for pre-processing even very large numbers of gc-ms samples within hours. we developed a novel strategy to iteratively correct and update retention time indices for searching and identifying metabolites. the package is written in the r programming language with computationally intensive functions written in c for speed and performance. the package includes a graphical user interface to allow easy use by those unfamiliar with r.


CONCLUSIONS
targetsearch allows fast and accurate data pre-processing for gc-ms experiments and overcomes the sample number limitations and manual curation requirements of existing software. we validate our method by carrying out an analysis against both a set of known chemical standard mixtures and of a biological experiment. in addition we demonstrate its capabilities and speed by comparing it with other gc-ms pre-processing tools. we believe this package will greatly ease current bottlenecks and facilitate the analysis of metabolic profiling data.
