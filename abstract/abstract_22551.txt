BACKGROUND
sterile alpha motif  domains are small protein modules that can be involved in homotypic or heterotypic associations and exhibit different functions. previous studies have demonstrated that the sam domain of the lipid phosphatase ship <dig> can hetero-dimerize with the sam domain of the pi3k effector protein arap <dig> 


RESULTS
here, we determine the nmr solution structure of arap3-sam and implement a multidisciplinary approach consisting of nmr spectroscopy, itc , mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies to analyze the interaction between ship2-sam and arap3-sam. this work reveals that arap3-sam may associate with ship2-sam by adopting a binding mode common to other sam domains. this binding mode is identical to what we have very recently observed for the association between ship2-sam and the sam domain from the ephrin a <dig> receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies further clarify the structural features that are relevant for sam-sam interactions involving ship <dig> and give additional hints that could be used for the identification of new molecules able to selectively inhibit sam-sam associations.
