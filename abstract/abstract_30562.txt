BACKGROUND
ionic aluminum  is rhizotoxic and can be present in acid soils at concentrations high enough to inhibit root growth. many forest tree species grow naturally in acid soils and often tolerate high concentrations of al. previously, we have shown that aspen  releases citrate and oxalate from roots in response to al exposure. to obtain further insights into the root responses of aspen to al, we investigated root gene expression at al conditions that inhibit root growth.


RESULTS
treatment of the aspen roots with  <dig> Î¼m al induced a strong inhibition of root growth within  <dig> h of exposure time. the root growth subsequently recovered, reaching growth rates comparable to that of control plants. changes in gene expression were determined after  <dig> h,  <dig> d, and  <dig> d of al exposure. replicated transcriptome analyses using the affymetrix poplar genome array revealed a total of  <dig> significantly up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes, of which 70% could be annotated based on arabidopsis genome resources. between  <dig> h and  <dig> d, the number of responsive genes strongly decreased from  <dig> to  <dig>  and then the number of changes remained low. the responses after  <dig> h were characterized by genes involved in cell wall modification, ion transport, and oxidative stress. two genes with prolonged induction were closely related to the arabidopsis al tolerance genes als <dig>  and mate . patterns of expression in different plant organs and in response to al indicated that the two aspen genes are homologs of the arabidopsis als <dig> and mate.


CONCLUSIONS
exposure of aspen roots to al results in a rapid inhibition of root growth and a large change in root gene expression. the subsequent root growth recovery and the concomitant reduction in the number of responsive genes presumably reflect the success of the roots in activating al tolerance mechanisms. the aspen genes als <dig> and mate may be important components of these mechanisms.
