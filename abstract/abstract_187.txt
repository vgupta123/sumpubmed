BACKGROUND
the whitebacked planthopper , sogatella furcifera horváth, is a serious rice pest in asia. ovicidal resistance is a natural rice defense mechanism against wbph and is characterized by the formation of watery lesions  and increased egg mortality  at the wbph oviposition sites.


RESULTS
this study aimed to understand the genetic and molecular basis of rice ovicidal resistance to wbph by combining genetic and genomic analyses. first, the ovicidal trait in doubled haploid rice lines derived from a wbph-resistant cultivar  and a wbph-susceptible cultivar  were phenotyped based on the necrotic symptoms of the leaf sheaths and em. using a constructed molecular linkage map,  <dig> quantitative trait loci  associated with wls and em were identified on eight chromosomes. of them, qwl <dig> was determined to be a major qtl for wl. based on chromosome segment substitution lines and a residual heterozygous population, a high-resolution linkage analysis further defined the qwl <dig> locus to a 122-kb region on chromosome  <dig>  which was annotated to encode  <dig> candidate genes. we then conducted an affymetrix microarray analysis to determine the transcript abundance in the cj <dig> and tn <dig> plants. upon wbph infestation,  <dig> genes in cj <dig> and  <dig> genes in tn <dig> were significantly up-regulated, while  <dig> genes in cj <dig> and  <dig> genes in tn <dig> were significantly down-regulated. this suggests that remarkable global changes in gene expression contribute to the ovicidal resistance of rice. notably, four genes in the 122-kb region of the qwl <dig> locus were differentially regulated between cj <dig> and tn <dig> in response to the wbph infestation, suggesting they may be candidate resistance genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the information obtained from the fine mapping of qwl <dig> and the microarray analyses will facilitate the isolation of this important resistance gene and its use in breeding wbph-resistant rice.
