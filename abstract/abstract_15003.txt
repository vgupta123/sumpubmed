BACKGROUND
longan is a tropical/subtropical fruit tree of great economic importance in southeast asia. progress in understanding molecular mechanisms of longan embryogenesis, which is the primary influence on fruit quality and yield, is slowed by lack of transcriptomic and genomic information. illumina second generation sequencing, which is suitable for generating enormous numbers of transcript sequences that can be used for functional genomic analysis of longan.


RESULTS
in this study, a longan embryogenic callus  cdna library was sequenced using an illumina hiseq  <dig> system. a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads comprising  <dig>  gb of nucleotides were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes of 448-bp mean length, with unigenes ≥ <dig> bp accounting for  <dig> % of the total. using blastx,  <dig>  unigenes were found to have significant similarity with accessions in nr and swiss- prot databases. of these,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> go sub-categories and  <dig>  unigenes were classified into  <dig> cog sub-groups. in addition,  <dig>  unigenes mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways, with the categories of metabolic pathways, plant-pathogen interaction, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and genetic information processing being well represented. analyses of unigenes ≥ <dig> bp revealed  <dig> embryogenesis-related unigenes as well as numerous unigenes expressed in ec associated with functions of reproductive growth, such as flowering, gametophytogenesis, and fertility, and vegetative growth, such as root and shoot growth. furthermore,  <dig> unigenes related to embryogenesis and reproductive and vegetative growth were validated by quantitative real time pcr  in samples from different stages of longan somatic embryogenesis ; their differentially expressions in the various embryogenic cultures indicated their possible roles in longan se.


CONCLUSIONS
the quantity and variety of expressed ec genes identified in this study is sufficient to serve as a global transcriptome dataset for longan ec and to provide more molecular resources for longan functional genomics.
