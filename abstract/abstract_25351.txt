BACKGROUND
trisomy of human chromosome  <dig>  results in down's syndrome, a complex developmental and neurodegenerative disease. molecular analysis of down's syndrome, however, poses a particular challenge, because the aneuploid region of chr <dig> contains many genes of unknown function. subcellular localization of human chr <dig> proteins may contribute to further understanding of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of the genes that code for these proteins. following this idea, we used a transfected-cell array technique to perform a rapid and cost-effective analysis of the intracellular distribution of chr  <dig> proteins.


RESULTS
we chose  <dig> genes that were distributed over the majority of 21q, ranging from rbm <dig>  to mcm3ap , with part of them expressed aberrantly in the down's syndrome mouse model. open reading frames of these genes were cloned into a mammalian expression vector with an amino-terminal his <dig> tag. all of the constructs were arrayed on glass slides and reverse transfected into hek293t cells for protein expression. co-localization detection using a set of organelle markers was carried out for each chr <dig> protein. here, we report the subcellular localization properties of  <dig> proteins. for  <dig> of these proteins, their localization is described for the first time. furthermore, the alteration in cell morphology and growth as a result of protein over-expression for claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> genes has been characterized.


CONCLUSIONS
the cell array-based protein expression and detection approach is a cost-effective platform for large-scale functional analyses, including protein subcellular localization and cell phenotype screening. the results from this study reveal novel functional features of human chr <dig> proteins, which should contribute to further understanding of the molecular pathology of down's syndrome.
