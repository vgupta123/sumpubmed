BACKGROUND
triticum monococcum  is an ancient diploid wheat with many useful traits and is used as a model for wheat gene discovery. dart  employs a hybridisation-based approach to type thousands of genomic loci in parallel. dart markers were developed for t. monococcum to assess genetic diversity, compare relationships with hexaploid genomes, and construct a genetic linkage map integrating dart and microsatellite markers.


RESULTS
a dart array, consisting of  <dig> hexaploid wheat,  <dig> tetraploid wheat,  <dig> t. monococcum as well as  <dig> t. boeoticum representative genomic clones, was used to fingerprint  <dig> t. monococcum accessions of diverse geographical origins. in total,  <dig> polymorphic dart markers were identified, of which  <dig> were of t. monococcum origin,  <dig> of hexaploid,  <dig> of tetraploid, and  <dig> of t. boeoticum genomes. the fingerprinting data indicated that the geographic origin of t. monococcum accessions was partially correlated with their genetic variation. dart markers could also well distinguish the genetic differences amongst a panel of  <dig> hexaploid wheat and nine t. monococcum genomes. for the first time,  <dig> dart markers were integrated with  <dig> simple sequence repeat  and two morphological trait loci in a genetic map spanning  <dig>  cm in t. monococcum. six chromosomes were represented by single linkage groups, and chromosome 4am was formed by three linkage groups. the dart and ssr genetic loci tended to form independent clusters along the chromosomes. segregation distortion was observed for one third of the dart loci. the ba  locus was refined to a  <dig>  cm region between the dart marker locus wpt- <dig> and the microsatellite locus xgwmd <dig> on 1am; and the hl  locus to a  <dig>  cm region between dart loci  <dig> and  <dig> on 5am.


CONCLUSIONS
dart is a rapid and efficient approach to develop many new molecular markers for genetic studies in t. monococcum. the constructed genetic linkage map will facilitate localisation and map-based cloning of genes of interest, comparative mapping as well as genome organisation and evolution studies between this ancient diploid species and other crops.
