BACKGROUND
standardization of cell-based immunologic monitoring is becoming increasingly important as methods for measuring cellular immunity become more complex. we assessed the ability of two commonly used cell-based assays, tritiated thymidine incorporation  and ifn-gamma elispot, to predict t cell responses to her-2/neu, tetanus toxoid , and cytomegalovirus  antigens. these antigens were determined to be low , moderate , and robustly  immunogenic proteins. samples from  <dig> stage ii, iii, and iv her-2/neu positive breast cancer patients, vaccinated against the her-2/neu protein and tt, were analyzed by tritiated thymidine incorporation and ifn-gamma elispot for t cell response.


RESULTS
linear regression analysis indicates that both stimulation index   and ifn-gamma secreting precursor frequency  are significant indicators of antigen specific immunity. roc curves plotted to assess the performance of tritiated thymidine incorporation and the elispot assay indicate that si is a significant indicator of low t cell response to the her-2/neu vaccine , and of moderate and robust responses to tt  and cmv , respectively. ifn-gamma precursor frequency is a significant indicator of a robust t cell response to cmv , but not of moderate tt , or low her-2/neu  t cell responses.


CONCLUSIONS
these data underscore the importance of taking into consideration the performance characteristics of assays used to measure t cell immunity. this consideration is particularly necessary when determining which method to utilize for assessing responses to immunotherapeutic manipulations in cancer patients.
