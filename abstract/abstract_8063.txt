BACKGROUND
germline mutations in lkb <dig> result in peutz-jeghers syndrome characterized by intestinal hamartomas and increased incidence of epithelial cancers. lkb <dig> encodes a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism through the ampk/mtor signaling pathway. in addition, lkb <dig> is homologous to par- <dig>  a polarity protein first described in c. elegans, while activation of lkb <dig> in mammalian epithelial cells induces the polarized assembly of actin filaments.


RESULTS
to explore the mechanism by which lkb <dig> interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, we introduced lkb <dig> into hela cells that lack endogenous lkb <dig>  this results in activation of the small gtpase rho and the assembly of linear actin filaments associated with focal adhesions. these effects on the actin cytoskeleton are attenuated by sirna-mediated depletion of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor dbl. co-expression of the lkb <dig> with the adaptor protein strad induces actin filament puncta associated with phospho-ezrin.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that lkb <dig> regulates the actin cytoskeleton through a dbl/rho pathway.
