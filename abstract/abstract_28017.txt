BACKGROUND
species of the family vibrionaceae are ubiquitous in marine environments. several of these species are important pathogens of humans and marine species. evidence indicates that genetic exchange plays an important role in the emergence of new pathogenic strains within this family. data from the sequenced genomes of strains in this family could show how the genes encoded by all these strains, known as the pangenome, are distributed. information about the core, accessory and panproteome of this family can show how, for example, genes encoding virulence-associated proteins are distributed and help us understand how virulence emerges.


RESULTS
we deduced the complete set of orthologs for eleven strains from this family. the core proteome consists of  <dig>  orthologous groups, which is 28% of the  <dig>  orthologous groups in this family. there were  <dig>  accessory orthologous groups  and  <dig>  unique proteins . proteins that have been associated with virulence in v. cholerae were widely distributed across the eleven genomes, but the majority was found only on the genomes of the two v. cholerae strains examined.


CONCLUSIONS
the proteomes are reflective of the differing evolutionary trajectories followed by different strains to similar phenotypes. the composition of the proteomes supports the notion that genetic exchange among species of the vibrionaceae is widespread and that this exchange aids these species in adapting to their environments.
