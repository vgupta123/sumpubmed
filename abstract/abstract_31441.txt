BACKGROUND
many genetic variants have been associated with susceptibility to complex traits by genome wide association studies , but for most, causal genes and mechanisms of action have yet to be elucidated. using bioinformatics, we identified index and proxy variants associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility, with the potential to affect splicing of candidate genes. pcr and sequence analysis of whole blood rna samples from population controls was then carried out for the  <dig> most promising variants to determine the effect of genetic variation on splicing of target genes.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> splice site snps with the potential to affect splicing, and prioritised  <dig> to determine the effect of genotype on candidate gene splicing. we identified that variants rs <dig> and rs <dig> were associated with altered splicing of the gsdmb and tsfm genes respectively. rs <dig>  present in the asthma and autoimmune disease susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q12- <dig>  was associated with the production of a novel Î” exon5- <dig> transcript of the gsdmb gene, and a separate decrease in the percentage of transcripts with inclusion of exon  <dig>  whereas the multiple sclerosis susceptibility variant rs <dig>  was associated with an alternative tfsm transcript encompassing a short cryptic exon within intron  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate the utility of a bioinformatic approach in identification and prioritisation of genetic variants effecting splicing of their host genes, and suggest that rs <dig> and rs <dig> may affect the splicing of the gsdmb and tsfm genes respectively.
