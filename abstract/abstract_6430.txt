BACKGROUND
prediction of the structural classes of proteins can provide important information about their functionalities as well as their major tertiary structures. it is also considered as an important step towards protein structure prediction problem. despite all the efforts have been made so far, finding a fast and accurate computational approach to solve protein structural class prediction problem still remains a challenging problem in bioinformatics and computational biology.


RESULTS
in this study we propose segmented distribution and segmented auto covariance feature extraction methods to capture local and global discriminatory information from evolutionary profiles and predicted secondary structure of the proteins. by applying svm to our extracted features, for the first time we enhance the protein structural class prediction accuracy to over 90% and 85% for two popular low-homology benchmarks that have been widely used in the literature. we report  <dig> % and  <dig> % prediction accuracies for 25pdb and  <dig> benchmarks which are respectively up to  <dig> % and  <dig> % better than previously reported results for these two benchmarks.


CONCLUSIONS
by proposing segmented distribution and segmented auto covariance feature extraction methods to capture local and global discriminatory information from evolutionary profiles and predicted secondary structure of the proteins, we are able to enhance the protein structural class prediction performance significantly.
