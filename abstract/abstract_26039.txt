BACKGROUND
the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the common terminal reaction in the gluconeogenic/glycogenolytic pathways and plays a central role in glucose homeostasis. in most mammals, different g6pc subunits are encoded by three paralogous genes . mutations in g6pc and g6pc <dig> are responsible for human mendelian diseases, whereas variants in g6pc <dig> are associated with fasting glucose  levels.


RESULTS
we analyzed the evolutionary history of g6pase genes. results indicated that the three paralogs originated during early vertebrate evolution and that negative selection was the major force shaping diversity at these genes in mammals. nonetheless, site-wise estimation of evolutionary rates at corresponding sites revealed weak correlations, suggesting that mammalian g6pases have evolved different structural features over time. we also detected pervasive positive selection at mammalian g6pc <dig>  most selected residues localize in the c-terminal protein region, where several human variants associated with fg levels also map. this region was re-sequenced in ~ <dig> subjects from saudi arabia,  <dig> of whom suffering from type  <dig> diabetes . the frequency of rare missense and nonsense variants was not significantly different in t2d and controls. association analysis with two common missense variants  revealed a weak but significant association for both snps when analyses were conditioned on rs <dig>  previously identified in a gwas for fg. two haplotypes were significantly associated with t2d with an opposite effect direction.


CONCLUSIONS
we detected pervasive positive selection at mammalian g6pc <dig> genes and we suggest that distinct haplotypes at the g6pc <dig> locus modulate susceptibility to t2d.
