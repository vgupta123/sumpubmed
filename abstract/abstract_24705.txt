BACKGROUND
epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is attributed to uncontrollable abnormal hyper-excitability of neurons. we investigated the feasibility of using low-intensity, pulsed radiation of focused ultrasound  to non-invasively suppress epileptic activity in an animal model , which was induced by the intraperitonial injection of pentylenetetrazol .


RESULTS
after the onset of induced seizures, fus was transcranially administered to the brain twice for three minutes each while undergoing electroencephalographic  monitoring. an air-backed, spherical segment ultrasound transducer  operating at a fundamental frequency of  <dig> khz was used to deliver a train of  <dig>  msec-long pulses of sonication at a repetitive rate of  <dig> hz to the thalamic areas of the brain. the acoustic intensity  used in the experiment was sufficiently within the range of safety guidelines for the clinical ultrasound imaging. the occurrence of epileptic eeg bursts from epilepsy-induced rats significantly decreased after sonication when it was compared to the pre-sonication epileptic state. the ptz-induced control group that did not receive any sonication showed a sustained number of epileptic eeg signal bursts. the animals that underwent sonication also showed less severe epileptic behavior, as assessed by the racine score. histological analysis confirmed that the sonication did not cause any damage to the brain tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
these results revealed that low-intensity, pulsed fus sonication suppressed the number of epileptic signal bursts using acute epilepsy model in animal. due to its non-invasiveness and spatial selectivity, fus may offer new perspectives for a possible non-invasive treatment of epilepsy.
