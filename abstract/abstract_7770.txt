BACKGROUND
haploinsufficiency of the foxl <dig> transcription factor in humans causes blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome , characterized by eyelid anomalies and premature ovarian failure. mice lacking foxl <dig> recapitulate human eyelid/forehead defects and undergo female gonadal dysgenesis. we report here that mice lacking foxl <dig> also show defects in postnatal growth and embryonic bone and cartilage formation.

methods
foxl2−/− male mice at different stages of development have been characterized and compared to wild type. body length and weight were measured and growth curves were created. skeletons were stained with alcian blue and/or alizarin red. bone and cartilage formation was analyzed by von kossa staining and immunofluorescence using anti-foxl <dig> and anti-sox <dig> antibodies followed by confocal microscopy. genes differentially expressed in skull vaults were evaluated by microarray analysis. analysis of the gh/igf <dig> pathway was done evaluating the expression of several hypothalamic-pituitary-bone axis markers by rt-qpcr.


RESULTS
compared to wild-type, foxl <dig> null mice are smaller and show skeletal abnormalities and defects in cartilage and bone mineralization, with down-regulation of the gh/igf <dig> axis. consistent with these effects, we find foxl <dig> expressed in embryos at  <dig>  dpc in neural tube epithelium, in head mesenchyme near the neural tube, and within the first branchial arch; then, starting at  <dig>  dpc, expressed in cartilaginous tissue; and at po and p <dig>  in hypothalamus.


CONCLUSIONS
our results support foxl <dig> as a master transcription factor in a spectrum of developmental processes, including growth, cartilage and bone formation. its action overlaps that of sox <dig>  though they are antagonistic in female vs male gonadal sex determination but conjoint in cartilage and skeletal development.
