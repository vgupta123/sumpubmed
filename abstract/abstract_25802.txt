BACKGROUND
although it is known that regulatory t cells  can suppress the function of effector t cells, and may contribute to impaired immune response, the precise role of tregs during the course of hepatitis b virus  infection remains to be elucidated. a newly identified subset of the cd4+foxp3+ tregs, the cd39+ tregs, has been associated with viral infections and autoimmune diseases. therefore, we hypothesized that this discrete treg subset may contribute to the chronic infection of hbv.


RESULTS
initial characterization studies of healthy peripheral cd39+foxp3+cd4+ t cells revealed that the majority were cd45ra- treg cells. subsequent analysis of hbv-infected patients ,  <dig> chronic active hepatitis b ,  <dig> hbv-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure ) and healthy individuals  was conducted to assess association with hbv copy number and the liver injury marker alanine aminotransferase . a higher percentage of cd39+ tregs was detected within the population of foxp3+cd4+ t cells in peripheral blood of ascs patients. moreover, the percentage of cd39+ tregs was significantly less in cah and aclf patients. the increased proportions of circulating cd39+ tregs were positively correlated with serum viral load, but inversely correlated with serum alt level.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings not only suggest that cd39+ treg cells may be involved in hbv disease progression but also identify cd39+ tregs as a dynamic immune regulatory cell population that may represent a new target of immunomodulatory therapeutic interventions.
