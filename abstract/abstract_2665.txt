BACKGROUND
mycobacterium yongonense, as a novel member of the m. avium complex , was recently reported to be isolated from human specimens in south korea and italy. due to its close relatedness to other mac members, particularly m. intracellulare in taxonomic aspects, the development of a novel diagnostic method for its specific detection is necessary for clinical or epidemiologic purposes.

methods
using the mycobacterium yongonense genome information, we have identified a novel is-element, ismyo <dig>  targeting the ismyo <dig> sequence, we developed a real-time pcr method and applied the technique to mycobacterial genomic dna.


RESULTS
to identify proper nucleic acid targets for the diagnosis, comparisons of all insertion sequence  elements of 3 m. intracellulare and 3 m. yongonense strains, whose complete genome sequences we reported recently, led to the selection of a novel target gene, the m. yongonense-specific is element, ismyo <dig> , belonging to the is <dig> family. next, we developed a real-time pcr method using sybr green i for m. yongonense-specific detection targeting ismyo <dig>  producing a 338-bp amplicon. when this assay was applied to  <dig> mycobacterium reference strains and  <dig> mac clinical isolates, it produced amplicons in only the 6 m. yongonense strains, showing a sensitivity of 100 fg of genomic dna, suggesting its feasibility as a diagnostic method for m. yongonense strains.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a novel ismyo <dig> is element belonging to the is <dig> family specific to m. yongonense strains via genome analysis, and a real-time pcr method based on its sequences was developed.
