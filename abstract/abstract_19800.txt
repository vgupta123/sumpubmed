BACKGROUND
many computational tools that detect recombination in viruses are not adapted for the ongoing genomic revolution. a computational tool is needed, that will rapidly scan hundreds/thousands of genomes or sequence fragments and detect candidate recombination events that may later be further analyzed with more sensitive and specialized methods.


RESULTS
t-recs, a windows based graphical tool, employs pairwise alignment of sliding windows and can perform  genotyping,  clustering of new genomes,  detect recent recombination events among different evolutionary lineages,  manual inspection of detected recombination events by similarity plots and  annotation of genomic regions.


CONCLUSIONS
t-recs is very effective, as demonstrated by an analysis of  <dig> norovirus complete genomes and  <dig> sequence fragments, where a recombination hotspot was identified at the orf1-orf <dig> junction.
