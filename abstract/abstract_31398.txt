BACKGROUND
thymus is the crucial site for t cell development and once believed to be immune privileged. recently, thymus has gained special attention as it is commonly targeted by infectious agents which may cause pathogenic tolerance and subsequent immunosuppression.


RESULTS
we analyzed thymic responses to the challenge with salmonella typhimurium  or lipopolysaccharide  derived from stm in chicks. newly hatched chicks were injected intraperitoneally with 5 × 104 cfu/ml stm or 50 mg/kg lps. after lps treatment, maximum thymocyte death  compared to controls was found at 12 h, and maximum loss of thymic weight  and reduced thymic index  were found at 36 h. after stm infection, maximum thymocyte death and thymic atrophy occurred at  <dig> and 72 h, respectively. no significant changes of thymic structure, cht1+ and cd4+/cd8+ t cell ratio were observed in thymus or spleen tissues after lps treatment. furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed important roles for the tlr4-fos/jun signaling pathway in thymic injury. thus, the major process of thymic atrophy in this study first involved activation of transcriptional factors fos/jun upon lps binding to tlr <dig> that caused release of inflammatory factors, thereby inducing inflammatory responses and dna damage and ultimately cell cycle arrest and thymic injury.


CONCLUSIONS
stm and salmonella lps could induce acute chick thymic injury. lps treatment acted faster than stm. tlr4-fos/jun pathway may play an important role in lps induced chick thymic injury.
