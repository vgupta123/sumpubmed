BACKGROUND
gray leaf spot , caused by magnaporthe oryzae , in ryegrasses is a very serious problem. heavily infected small seedlings die within a matter of days, and stands of the grasses are seriously damaged by the disease. thus, the development of gls-resistant cultivars has become a concern in ryegrass breeding.


RESULTS
phenotypic segregations in a single cross-derived f <dig> population of italian ryegrass  indicated that the gls resistance in the population was possibly controlled by one or two dominant genes with  <dig> – <dig> % of broad-sense heritability. in bulked segregant analyses, two simple sequence repeat  markers, which have so far been reported to locate on linkage group   <dig> of italian ryegrass, showed specific signals in the resistant parent and resistant bulk, indicating that the resistance gene locus was possibly in the lg  <dig>  we thus constructed a genetic linkage map of the lg  <dig> covering  <dig>  centimorgan with other ssr markers of the lg  <dig> of italian ryegrass and grass anchor probes that have previously been assigned to lg  <dig> of ryegrasses, and with rice expressed sequence tag -derived markers selected from a rice est map of chromosome   <dig> since lg  <dig> of ryegrasses are syntenic to rice chr  <dig>  quantitative trait locus  analysis with the genetic linkage map and phenotypic data of the f <dig> population detected a major locus for gls resistance. proportions of phenotypic variance explained by the qtl at the highest logarithm of odds scores were  <dig> – <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
a resistance locus was confirmed as novel for gls resistance, because its genetic position was different from other known loci for gls resistance. broad-sense heritability and the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the qtl were similar, suggesting that most of the genetic factors for the resistance phenotype against gls in the f <dig> population can be explained by a function of the single resistance locus. we designated the putative gene for the novel resistance locus as lmpi <dig>  lmpi <dig> will be useful for future development of gls-resistant cultivars in combination with other resistance genes.
