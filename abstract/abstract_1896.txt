BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  can be isolated from traditional milk products. lab that secrete substances that inhibit pathogenic bacteria and are resistant to acid, bile, and pepsin but not vancomycin may have potential in food applications.


RESULTS
lab isolated from a range of traditional fermented products were screened for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. a total of  <dig> lab strains were isolated from fermented milk products in the form of fresh curds, dried curds, and ghara , and fermented cocoa bean. eleven lab isolates that produced antimicrobial substances were identified as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and pediococcus acidilactici strains by biochemical methods and 16s rdna gene sequencing. of these, the cell-free supernatant of kp <dig>  most strongly inhibited listeria monocytogenes. further analysis identified the antimicrobial substance produced by kp <dig> as proteinaceous in nature and active over a wide ph range. kp <dig>  was found to be catalase-negative, able to produce Î²-galactosidase, resistant to bile salts  and acidic conditions , and susceptible to most antibiotics.


CONCLUSIONS
traditionally prepared fermented milk products are good sources of lab with characteristics suitable for industrial applications. the isolate kp <dig>  shows potential for the production of probiotic and functional foods.
