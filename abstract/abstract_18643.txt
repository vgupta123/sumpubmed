BACKGROUND
methyl-dna binding proteins help to translate epigenetic information encoded by dna methylation into covalent histone modifications. mbd2/ <dig> is the only candidate gene in the drosophila genome with extended homologies to mammalian mbd <dig> and mbd <dig> proteins, which represent a co-repressor and an integral component of the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase  complex, respectively. an association of drosophila mbd2/ <dig> with the drosophila nurd complex has been suggested previously. we have now analyzed the molecular interactions between mbd2/ <dig> and the nurd complex in greater detail.


RESULTS
the two mbd2/ <dig> isoforms precisely cofractionated with nurd proteins during gel filtration of extracts derived from early and late embryos. in addition, we demonstrate that mbd2/ <dig> forms multimers, and engages in specific interactions with the p <dig> and mi- <dig> subunits of the drosophila nurd complex.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide novel insights into the association between drosophila mbd2/ <dig> and nurd proteins. additionally, this work provides a first analysis of the architecture of the drosophila nurd complex.
