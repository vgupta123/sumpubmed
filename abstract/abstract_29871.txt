BACKGROUND
chromatin architectural proteins interact with nucleosomes to modulate chromatin accessibility and higher-order chromatin structure. while these proteins are almost certainly important for gene regulation they have been studied far less than the core histone proteins.


RESULTS
here we describe the genomic distributions and functional roles of two chromatin architectural proteins: histone h <dig> and the high mobility group protein hmgd <dig> in drosophila s <dig> cells. using chip-seq, biochemical and gene specific approaches, we find that hmgd <dig> binds to highly accessible regulatory chromatin and active promoters. in contrast, h <dig> is primarily associated with heterochromatic regions marked with repressive histone marks. we find that the ratio of hmgd <dig> to h <dig> binding is a better predictor of gene activity than either protein by itself, which suggests that reciprocal binding between these proteins is important for gene regulation. using knockdown experiments, we show that hmgd <dig> and h <dig> affect the occupancy of the other protein, change nucleosome repeat length and modulate gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our data suggest that dynamic and mutually exclusive binding of h <dig> and hmgd <dig> to nucleosomes and their linker sequences may control the fluid chromatin structure that is required for transcriptional regulation. this study provides a framework to further study the interplay between chromatin architectural proteins and epigenetics in gene regulation.
