BACKGROUND
olfaction in animals is important for host localization, mating and reproduction in heterogeneous chemical environments. studying the molecular basis of olfactory receptor neurons  systems can elucidate the evolution of olfaction and associated behaviours. odorant receptors  in insects have been identified, particularly in the holometabolous model drosophila, and some of them have been functionally studied. however, ors in the locust—a hemimetabolous model insect and the most important insect crop pest—have not yet been identified, hindering our understanding of locust olfaction. here, we report for the first time four putative ors in locusta migratoria: lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> 


RESULTS
these four putative or genes encoded proteins with amino acids of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. sequence identity among them ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. all ors were tissue-specifically expressed in olfactory organs, without sex-biased characteristics. however, lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> were only expressed in the antenna, while lmigor <dig> could also be detected in mouthparts. in situ hybridization demonstrated that the lmigor1antisense probe labelled olfactory receptor neurons  in almost all segments of the antenna, but only a few segments housed orns expressing lmigor <dig>  the number of neurons labelled by lmigor <dig> antisense probes in each antennal segment was much greater  than that labelled by lmigor <dig> probes . furthermore, some of the labelled neurons could be attributed to the basiconic sensilla, but lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> were expressed in different subtypes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results strongly suggested that these newly discovered genes encode locust ors and the differential expression patterns of lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> implied distinct functions. these results may offer insights into locust olfaction and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of insect chemoreception.
