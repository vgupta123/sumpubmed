BACKGROUND
rna interference  technology shows a great potential in controlling agricultural pests, despite the difficulty of introducing exogenous dsrna/sirna into target pests. isaria fumosorosea is a common fungal pathogen of the b-biotype bemisia tabaci , which is a widespread pest. entomopathogenic fungi directly penetrate the cuticle and invade insect hemocoel. application of i. fumosorosea expressing dsrna of whitefly immunity-related gene may aid in developing rnai technology to effectively control whiteflies.

methods
a dsrna expression plasmid, pstlr <dig>  was constructed by introducing the toll-like receptor  <dig>  gene of b-biotype whitefly to the silent vector, psilent- <dig>  the plasmid pstlr <dig> was transferred into the protoplast of the i. fumosorosea strain ifb <dig>  then, the recombinant strain was screened out based on the biological stability and bioactivity against whitefly.


RESULTS
a genetically stable recombinant strain ifb01-trl <dig> was screened out. the impact of ifb01-trl <dig> against whitefly trl <dig> gene was validated by qpcr. lower expression levels of the tlr <dig> gene was observed in the whiteflies infected by the recombinant strain. the bioassay results indicated that compared to ifb <dig> strain, ifb01-trl <dig> increased the mortality of whitefly nymphs, and decreased and shortened the values of lc <dig> and lt <dig>  thus indicating higher virulence of ifb01-trl <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the expression of the dsrna of whitefly tlr <dig> gene in recombinant i. fumosorosea strain successfully knocked down the host target gene by infecting the nymphs and enhanced the whiteflies mortality. the present study will give insight to new application of rnai technology for more effective biocontrol of this pests.
