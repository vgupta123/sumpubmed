BACKGROUND
outer membrane proteins  perform diverse functional roles in gram-negative bacteria. identification of outer membrane proteins is an important task.


RESULTS
this paper presents a method for distinguishing outer membrane proteins  from non-omps ). first, we calculated the average residue compositions of omps, globular proteins and imps separately using a training set. then for each protein from the test set, its distances to the three groups were calculated based on residue composition using a weighted euclidean distance  approach. proteins from the test set were classified into omp versus non-omp classes based on the least distance. the proposed method can distinguish between omps and non-omps with  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient . we then improved the method by including homologous sequences into the calculation of residue composition and using a feature-selection method to select the single residue and di-peptides that were useful for omp prediction. the final method achieves an accuracy of  <dig> % with  <dig>  mcc. in direct comparisons, the proposed method outperforms previously published methods.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method can identify omps with improved performance. it will be very helpful to the discovery of omps in a genome scale.
