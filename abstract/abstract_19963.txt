BACKGROUND
bovine respiratory syncytial virus  is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease  complex. the seroprevalence to brsv in norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear. the aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of brsv and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of brd and to perform phylogenetic analysis of norwegian brsv strains.


RESULTS
brsv infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in  <dig>  of  <dig> outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. when serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus  <dig> were present, the number of brsv positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view of brsv as the main pathogen. sequencing of the g gene of brsv positive samples showed that the current circulating norwegian brsvs belong to genetic subgroup ii, along with other north european isolates. one isolate from an outbreak in norway in  <dig> was also investigated. this strain formed a separate branch in subgroup ii, clearly different from the current scandinavian sequences. the currently circulating brsv could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time. the sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the g protein.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrated that brsv is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of brd in norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent. the phylogenetic analysis of the norwegian strains of brsv and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of brsv.
