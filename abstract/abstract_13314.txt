BACKGROUND
the transcription factor barhl <dig> is an antiproneural transcription factor with roles in neuronal differentiation. the functions of its homologue in drosophila development are better understood than its functions in mammalian brain development. existing evidence suggests that its expression in the embryonic forebrain of the mouse is regional and may complement that of another transcription factor that is important for forebrain development, pax <dig>  the aim of this study is to provide a more detailed description of the barhl <dig> expression pattern in the embryonic forebrain than is currently available, to relate its expression domains to those of pax <dig> and to examine the effects of pax <dig> loss on barhl <dig> expression.


RESULTS
we found that barhl <dig> is expressed in the developing diencephalon from the time of anterior neural tube closure. its expression initially overlaps that of pax <dig> in a central region of the alar diencephalon but over the following days their domains of expression become complementary in most forebrain regions. the exceptions are the thalamus and pretectum, where countergradients of pax <dig> and barhl <dig> expression are established by embryonic day  <dig> , before overall pax <dig> levels in these regions decline greatly while barhl <dig> levels remain relatively high. we found that barhl <dig> expression becomes upregulated in specifically the thalamus and pretectum in pax6-null mice.


CONCLUSIONS
the region-specific expression pattern of barhl <dig> makes it likely to be an important player in the development of region-specific differences in embryonic mouse forebrain. repression of its expression in the thalamus and pretectum by pax <dig> may be crucial for allowing proneural factors to promote normal neuronal differentiation in this region.
