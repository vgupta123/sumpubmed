BACKGROUND
the t cell attracting chemokine ccl <dig> is produced by antigen presenting cells and a role for ccl <dig> has been suggested in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. rheumatoid arthritis  is one of these conditions, in which abundant ccl <dig> production is present. although th <dig> cytokines and il- <dig> are known to have an effect on ccl <dig> production, there are several gaps in our knowledge regarding the exact regulation of ccl <dig> secretion, both in general and in ra. in this study we provide new insights in the regulation of ccl <dig> secretion by monocytes and dendritic cells.


RESULTS
in contrast to a large panel of pro-inflammatory stimuli , t cell mimicking molecules  or tlr driven maturation, the anti-inflammatory il- <dig> strongly stimulated dc to secrete ccl <dig>  on freshly isolated monocytes, ccl <dig> secretion was induced by il- <dig> and il- <dig>  in strong synergy with il- <dig>  this synergistic effect could already be observed after only  <dig> hours, indicating that not only macrophages and dendritic cells, but also monocytes secrete ccl <dig> under these stimulatory conditions. a high ccl <dig> expression was detected in ra synovial tissue and incubation of monocytes with synovial fluid from ra patients clearly enhanced the effects of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  surprisingly, the effect of synovial fluid was not driven by il- <dig> of il- <dig>  suggesting the presence of another ccl <dig> inducing factor in synovial fluid.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, il- <dig> synergistically induces ccl <dig> secretion in combination with il- <dig> of il- <dig> on monocytes and monocyte derived cells. the effects of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> are strongly enhanced by synovial fluid. this synergy may contribute to the high ccl <dig> expression in ra.
