BACKGROUND
the vertebrate adult axial skeleton, trunk and limb skeletal muscles and dermis of the back all arise from early embryonic structures called somites. somites are symmetrically positioned flanking the embryo axial structures  and are periodically formed in a anterior-posterior direction from the presomitic mesoderm. the time required to form a somite pair is constant and species-specific. this extraordinary periodicity is proposed to depend on an underlying somitogenesis molecular clock, firstly evidenced by the cyclic expression of the chick hairy <dig> gene in the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm with a  <dig> min periodicity, corresponding to the time required to form a somite pair in the chick embryo. the number of hairy <dig> oscillations at any given moment is proposed to provide the cell with both temporal and positional information along the embryo's anterior-posterior axis. nevertheless, how this is accomplished and what biological processes are involved is still unknown. aiming at understanding the molecular events triggered by the somitogenesis clock hairy <dig> protein, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify hairy <dig> interaction partners.


RESULTS
sap <dig>  an adaptor molecule of the sin3/hdac transcriptional repressor complex, was found to interact with the c-terminal portion of the hairy <dig> protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay and the hairy1/sap <dig> interaction was independently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. we have characterized the expression patterns of both sap <dig> and sin3a genes during chick embryo development, using in situ hybridization experiments. we found that both sap <dig> and sin3a expression patterns co-localize in vivo with hairy <dig> expression domains in chick rostral presomitic mesoderm and caudal region of somites.


CONCLUSIONS
hairy <dig> belongs to the hairy-enhancer-of-split family of transcriptional repressor proteins. our results indicate that during chick somitogenesis hairy <dig> may mediate gene transcriptional repression by recruiting the sin3/hdac complex, through a direct interaction with the sap <dig> adaptor molecule. moreover, since sap <dig> and sin3a are not expressed in the psm territory where hairy <dig> presents cyclic expression, our study strongly points to different roles for hairy <dig> throughout the psm and in the prospective somite and caudal region of already formed somites.
