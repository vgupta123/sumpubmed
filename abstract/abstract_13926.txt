BACKGROUND
immunoregulatory probiotics  have been proposed to improve piglets’ immune system to avoid intestinal infections and reduce unproductive inflammation after weaning. previously, it was demonstrated that lactobacillus jensenii tl <dig>  attenuated the inflammatory response triggered by activation of toll-like receptor  <dig>  in porcine intestinal epithelial  cells and antigen presenting cells  from porcine peyer’s patches .

objective
in view of the critical importance of pie-apcs interactions in the regulation of intestinal immune responses, we aimed to examine the effect of ljtl <dig> on activation patterns of apcs from swine pps in co-cultures with pie cells. in addition, we investigated whether ljtl <dig> was able to beneficially modulate intestinal immunity of piglets after weaning to improve immune-health status.


RESULTS
stimulation of pie-apcs co-cultures with ljtl <dig> increased the expression of mhc-ii, cd80/ <dig>  il- <dig>  and bcl- <dig> in cd172a+cd11r1- and cd172a+cd11r1high apcs. in addition, the tl <dig> strain caused the upregulation of three negative regulators of tlr <dig> in pie cells: mkp- <dig>  bcl- <dig> and a <dig>  these changes significantly reduced the inflammatory response triggered by tlr <dig> activation in pie-apcs co-cultures. the in vivo experiments using castrated male piglets  with landrace , large yorkshire  and duroc )of 3 weeks of age demonstrated that feeding with ljtl <dig> significantly reduced blood complement activity and c reactive protein concentrations while no changes were observed in blood leukocytes, ratio of granulocytes to lymphocyte numbers, macrophages’ activity and antibody levels. in addition, treatment with ljtl <dig> significantly improved growth performance and productivity, and increased carcass quality.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the use of immunobiotics strains like ljtl <dig>  as supplemental additives for piglets feedings, could be used as a strategy to maintain and improve intestinal homeostasis; that is important for the development of the pig and for health and performance throughout the productive life of the animal.
