BACKGROUND
the adenosine/uridine-rich element -binding protein auf <dig> functions to regulate the inflammatory response through the targeted degradation of cytokine and other mrnas that contain specific ares in their 3' noncoding region . to investigate the role of auf <dig> in the immune system, we characterized the lymphoid compartments of auf1-deficient mice.


RESULTS
mice lacking auf <dig> exhibit an altered proportion and size of splenic b cell subsets. we show prominent apoptosis in splenic b cell follicles and reduced expression of bcl- <dig>  a <dig>  and bcl-xl correlate with increased turnover and significant reduction in the number and proportion of splenic fo b cells in auf1-deficient mice. in addition, auf1-deficient mice exhibit a sharp decrease in splenic size and lymphocyte cellularity. bone marrow transfer studies demonstrate that auf <dig> deficiency induces cell-autonomous defects in mature b cell subsets but not in the overall number of splenocytes. reconstitution of irradiated adult auf1-deficient mice with wild-type bone marrow restores the proportion of fo and marginal zone  b cells, but does not rescue the decrease in the number of splenocytes. functionally, auf1-deficient mice mount an attenuated response to t cell-independent  antigen, which correlates with impaired mz b cell function.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that auf <dig> is important in the maintenance of splenic fo b cells and adequate humoral immune responses.
