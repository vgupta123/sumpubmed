BACKGROUND
acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype  is a distinct biological entity associated with a very poor outcome. since complex karyotypes frequently contain deletions of the chromosomal region 12p <dig> encompassing the tumor suppressor genes etv <dig> and cdkn1b, we aimed to unravel their modes of inactivation in ck-aml.


RESULTS
to decipher deletions, mutations and methylation of etv <dig> and cdkn1b, arraycgh, snp arrays, direct sequencing of all coding exons and pyrosequencing of the 5′utr cpg islands of etv <dig> and cdkn1b were performed. in total,  <dig> of  <dig> patients  showed monoallelic deletions of 12p <dig> according to karyotypic data and  <dig> of  <dig> patients  according to genomic profiling. genomic profiling led to the minimal deleted region covering the 3′-utr of etv <dig> and cdkn1b. direct sequencing revealed one novel monoallelic frameshift mutation in etv <dig> while no mutations in cdkn1b were identified. furthermore, methylation levels of etv <dig> and cdkn1b did not indicate transcriptional silencing of any of these genes. etv <dig> and cdkn1b had reduced expression levels in ck-aml patients with deletion in 12p <dig> as compared to ck-aml without deletion in 12p <dig>  while the other genes  located within the minimal deleted region in 12p <dig> had very low or missing expression in ck-aml irrespective of their copy number status.


CONCLUSIONS
etv <dig> and cdkn1b are mainly affected by small monoallelic deletions, whereas mutations and hypermethylation play a minor role in ck-aml. reduced gene dosage led to reduced gene expression levels, pointing to haploinsufficiency as the relevant mechanism of inactivation of etv <dig> and cdkn1b in ck-aml.
