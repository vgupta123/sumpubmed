BACKGROUND
the transcription factor ap- <dig> positively controls synaptic plasticity at the drosophila neuromuscular junction. although in motor neurons, jnk has been shown to activate ap- <dig>  a positive regulator of growth and strength at the larval nmj, the consequences of jnk activation are poorly studied. in addition, the downstream transcriptional targets of jnk and ap- <dig> signaling in the drosophila nervous system have yet to be identified. here, we further investigated the role of jnk signaling at this model synapse employing an activated form of jnk-kinase; and using serial analysis of gene expression and oligonucleotide microarrays, searched for candidate early targets of jnk or ap- <dig> dependent transcription in neurons.


RESULTS
temporally-controlled jnk induction in postembryonic motor neurons triggers synaptic growth at the nmj indicating a role in developmental plasticity rather than synaptogenesis. an unexpected observation that jnk activation also causes a reduction in transmitter release is inconsistent with jnk functioning solely through ap- <dig> and suggests an additional, yet-unidentified pathway for jnk signaling in motor neurons. sage profiling of mrna expression helps define the neural transcriptome in drosophila. though many putative ap- <dig> and jnk target genes arose from the genomic screens, few were confirmed in subsequent validation experiments. one potentially important neuronal ap- <dig> target discovered, cg <dig>  was previously implicated in olfactory associative memory. in addition,  <dig> mrnas regulated by ru <dig>  a steroid used to trigger conditional gene expression were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates a novel role for jnk signaling at the larval neuromuscular junction and provides a quantitative profile of gene transcription in drosophila neurons. while identifying potential jnk/ap- <dig> targets it reveals the limitations of genome-wide analyses using complex tissues like the whole brain.
