BACKGROUND
parameter estimation from experimental data is critical for mathematical modeling of protein regulatory networks. for realistic networks with dozens of species and reactions, parameter estimation is an especially challenging task. in this study, we present an approach for parameter estimation that is effective in fitting a model of the budding yeast cell cycle  to the experimentally observed phenotypes  of  <dig> genetic strains carrying mutations of cell cycle genes.


RESULTS
starting from an initial guess of the parameter values, which correctly captures the phenotypes of only  <dig> genetic strains, our parameter estimation algorithm quickly improves the success rate of the model to 105– <dig> of the  <dig> strains. this success rate is comparable to the best values achieved by a skilled modeler manually choosing parameters over many weeks. the algorithm combines two search and optimization strategies. first, we use latin hypercube sampling to explore a region surrounding the initial guess. from these samples, we choose ∼ <dig> different sets of parameter values that correctly capture wild type viability. these sets form the starting generation of differential evolution that selects new parameter values that perform better in terms of their success rate in capturing phenotypes. in addition to producing highly successful combinations of parameter values, we analyze the results to determine the parameters that are most critical for matching experimental outcomes and the most competitive strains whose correct outcome with a given parameter vector forces numerous other strains to have incorrect outcomes. these “most critical parameters” and “most competitive strains” provide biological insights into the model. conversely, the “least critical parameters” and “least competitive strains” suggest ways to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach proves to be a useful tool to help systems biologists fit complex dynamical models to large experimental datasets. in the process of fitting the model to the data, the tool identifies suggestive correlations among aspects of the model and the data.
