BACKGROUND
cd <dig>  is a sialomucin which has been suggested to participate in regulating the proliferation, cell adhesion and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. cd <dig> is also involved in the development of cancer. the functions of cis-regulatory elements of cd <dig> remain relatively unknown.

methods
in this study, we investigated the function of cis-regulatory elements within the promoter of cd <dig>  we fused the 5'-flanking region of cd <dig> to a luciferase reporter vector. the minimal promoter region was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. using in silico analysis, we found the presence of one hif-1alpha  motif  overlapping e-box  and two ap-1-like binding sites , one of which is also overlapped with hif-1alpha sequence. dual-luciferase assay was performed to examine the transcriptional activity of ap- <dig> and hif-1alpha of cd <dig> promoter. quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  was performed to measure cd <dig> expression. chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the binding of hif-1alpha and cd <dig> 


RESULTS
co-transfection of c-jun, hif-1alpha and minimal promoter region construct demonstrated that c-jun and hif-1alpha bound the cd <dig> promoter and promoted cd <dig> expression. hypoxia treatment also led to the up-regulation of cd <dig> expression. the mutation of overlapping sequences resulted in the reduced expression of cd <dig> induced by hif-1alpha. chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the hif-1alpha bound the minimal promoter region.


CONCLUSIONS
determination of the optimal promoter region and transcription factors governing cd <dig> expression is useful in understanding cd <dig> functions. these results suggest that cis-regulatory elements of cd <dig> overlapping hif-1alpha/e-box/ap-1-like sequences may play important regulatory roles.
