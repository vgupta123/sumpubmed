BACKGROUND
the nonparametric trend test  is well suitable for identifying the genetic variants associated with quantitative traits when the trait values do not satisfy the normal distribution assumption. if the genetic model, defined according to the mode of inheritance, is known, the npt derived under the given genetic model is optimal. however, in practice, the genetic model is often unknown beforehand. the npt derived from an uncorrected model might result in loss of power. when the underlying genetic model is unknown, a robust test is preferred to maintain satisfactory power.


RESULTS
we propose a two-phase procedure to handle the uncertainty of the genetic model for non-normal quantitative trait genetic association study. first, a model selection procedure is employed to help choose the genetic model. then the optimal test derived under the selected model is constructed to test for possible association. to control the type i error rate, we derive the joint distribution of the test statistics developed in the two phases and obtain the proper size.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method is more robust than existing methods through the simulation results and application to gene dnah <dig> from the genetic analysis workshop  <dig> for associated with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody further demonstrate its performance.
