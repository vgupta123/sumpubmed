BACKGROUND
the clock-controlled rna-binding protein atgrp <dig> influences circadian oscillations of its own transcript at the post-transcriptional level. to identify additional targets that are regulated by atgrp <dig>  transcript profiles of transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing atgrp <dig>  and wild type plants were compared.


RESULTS
approximately  <dig> % of the transcripts represented on the affymetrix ath <dig> microarray showed changes in steady-state abundance upon atgrp <dig> overexpression. one third of the differentially expressed genes are controlled by the circadian clock, and they show a distinct bias of their phase: the up-regulated genes preferentially peak around dawn, roughly opposite to the atgrp <dig> peak abundance whereas the down-regulated genes preferentially peak at the end of the day. further, transcripts responsive to abiotic and biotic stimuli were enriched among atgrp <dig> targets. transcripts encoding the pathogenesis-related pr <dig> and pr <dig> proteins were elevated in atgrp7-ox plants but not in plants overexpressing atgrp <dig> with a point mutation in the rna-binding domain, indicating that the regulation involves rna binding activity of atgrp <dig>  gene set enrichment analysis uncovered components involved in ribosome function and rna metabolism among groups of genes upregulated in atgrp7-ox plants, consistent with its role in post-transcriptional regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
apart from regulating a suite of circadian transcripts in a time-of-day dependent manner atgrp <dig>  both directly and indirectly, affects other transcripts including transcripts responsive to abiotic and biotic stimuli. this suggests a regulatory role of atgrp <dig> in the output of the endogenous clock and a complex network of transcripts responsive to external stimuli downstream of the atgrp <dig> autoregulatory circuit.
