BACKGROUND
the rosaceae encompass a large number of economically-important diploid and polyploid fruit and ornamental species in many different genera. the basic chromosome numbers of these genera are x =  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and all have compact and relatively similar genome sizes. comparative mapping between distantly-related genera has been performed to a limited extent in the rosaceae including a comparison between malus  and prunus ; however no data has been published to date comparing malus or prunus to a member of the subfamily rosoideae. in this paper we compare the genome of fragaria, a member of the rosoideae, to prunus, a member of the prunoideae.


RESULTS
the diploid genomes of prunus  and fragaria  were compared through the mapping of  <dig> anchor markers –  <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphisms ,  <dig> indels or single nucleotide polymorphisms  derived from expressed sequence tags  and two simple-sequence repeats  – on the reference maps of both genera. these markers provided good coverage of the prunus  and fragaria  genomes, with maximum gaps and average densities of  <dig> cm and  <dig>  cm/marker in prunus and  <dig> cm and  <dig>  cm/marker in fragaria.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate a clear pattern of synteny, with most markers of each chromosome of one of these species mapping to one or two chromosomes of the other. a large number of rearrangements , most of which produced by inversions  and the rest  by translocations or fission/fusion events could also be inferred. we have provided the first framework for the comparison of the position of genes or dna sequences of these two economically valuable and yet distantly-related genera of the rosaceae.
