BACKGROUND
cryptococcus gattii has been the cause of an ongoing outbreak starting in  <dig> on vancouver island, british columbia and spreading to mainland canada and the us pacific northwest. in the course of the outbreak, c. gattii has been identified outside of its previously documented climate, habitat, and host disease. genotyping of c. gattii is essential to understand the ecological and geographical expansion of this emerging pathogen.

methods
we developed and validated a mismatch amplification mutation assay  real-time pcr panel for genotyping c. gattii molecular types vgi-vgiv and vgii subtypes a,b,c. subtype assays were designed based on whole-genome sequence of  <dig> c. gattii strains. publically available multilocus sequence typing  data from a study of  <dig> strains was used for the molecular type  assay design. all assays were validated across dna from  <dig> strains of diverse international origin and sample types, including animal, environmental and human.


RESULTS
validation revealed each assay on the panel is 100% sensitive, specific and concordant with mlst. the assay panel can detect down to  <dig>  picograms of template dna.


CONCLUSIONS
the  real-time pcr panel for c. gattii accurately typed a collection of  <dig> diverse strains and demonstrated high sensitivity. this is a time and cost efficient method of genotyping c. gattii best suited for application in large-scale epidemiological studies.
