BACKGROUND
tilling  is an efficient reverse genetics approach for detecting induced mutations in pools of individuals. combined with the high-throughput of next-generation sequencing technologies, and the resolving power of overlapping pool design, tilling provides an efficient and economical platform for functional genomics across thousands of organisms.


RESULTS
we propose a probabilistic method for calling tilling-induced mutations, and their carriers, from high throughput sequencing data of overlapping population pools, where each individual occurs in two pools. we assign a probability score to each sequence position by applying bayes' theorem to a simplified binomial model of sequencing error and expected mutations, taking into account the coverage level. we test the performance of our method on variable quality, high-throughput sequences from wheat and rice mutagenized populations.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that our method effectively discovers mutations in large populations with sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %. it also outperforms existing snp detection methods in detecting real mutations, especially at higher levels of coverage variability across sequenced pools, and in lower quality short reads sequence data. the implementation of our method is available from: http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/filkov/camba/.
