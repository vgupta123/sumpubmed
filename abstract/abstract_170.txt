BACKGROUND
since  <dig>  a progressive pneumonia has become prevalent in broilers and laying hens. this disease occurrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30â€‰days, resulting in approximately 70% morbidity and 30% mortality in broilers. the objective of this study was to isolate and identify the pathogens that are responsible for the progressive pneumonia and establish an animal model for drug screening.


RESULTS
 <dig> serum samples were collected from  <dig> intensive farms from  <dig> provinces in china and analysed in the current research. our clinical survey showed that  <dig> % to 100% of breeding broilers, breeding layers, broilers and laying hens were seropositive for ort antibodies. from  <dig> intensive farms, six ort isolates were identified by pcr and biochemical assays, and two h9n <dig> viruses were isolated. newcastle disease virus  and infectious bronchitisvirus  were excluded. typical pneumonia and airsacculitis were observed both in broilers inoculated intraperitoneally with an ort isolate alone and in those co-infected with ort and h9n <dig> virus isolates. specifically, the survival rate was 30%, 20%, 70%, 50% and 90% in birds inoculated with ort+h9n <dig> virus, ort followed by h9n <dig> virus, h9n <dig> virus followed by ort, and ort or h9n <dig> virus alone, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study suggest that ort infections of domestic poultry have been occurring frequently in china. ort infection can induce higher economic losses and mortality if h9n <dig> aiv is also present. although the isolation of ort and h9n <dig> virus has been reported previously, there have been no reported co-infections of poultry with these two pathogens. this is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ort and h9n <dig> virus, and this co-infection is probably associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in china, which has caused extensive economic losses.
