BACKGROUND
phytochromes are a family of red/far-red photoreceptors that regulate a number of important developmental traits in cotton , including plant architecture, fiber development, and photoperiodic flowering. little is known about the composition and evolution of the phytochrome gene family in diploid  or allotetraploid  cotton species. the objective of this study was to obtain a preliminary inventory and molecular-evolutionary characterization of the phytochrome gene family in cotton.


RESULTS
we used comparative sequence resources to design low-degeneracy pcr primers that amplify genomic sequence tags  for members of the phya, phyb/d, phyc and phye gene sub-families from a- and d-genome diploid and ad-genome allotetraploid gossypium species. we identified two paralogous phya genes  in diploid cottons, the result of a malvaceae-specific phya gene duplication that occurred approximately  <dig> million years ago , before the divergence of the a- and d-genome ancestors. we identified a single gene copy of phyb, phyc, and phye in diploid cottons. the allotetraploid genomes have largely retained the complete gene complements inherited from both of the diploid genome ancestors, with at least four phya genes and two genes encoding phyb, phyc and phye in the ad-genomes. we did not identify a phyd gene in any cotton genomes examined.


CONCLUSIONS
detailed sequence analysis suggests that phytochrome genes retained after duplication by segmental duplication and allopolyploidy appear to be evolving independently under a birth-and-death-process with strong purifying selection. our study provides a preliminary phytochrome gene inventory that is necessary and sufficient for further characterization of the biological functions of each of the cotton phytochrome genes, and for the development of 'candidate gene' markers that are potentially useful for cotton improvement via modern marker-assisted selection strategies.
