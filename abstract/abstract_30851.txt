BACKGROUND
the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the evolution of the profile currently recommended by the international renal interest society   with a panel of other different kidney biomarkers during treatment for canine leishmaniosis. this panel included three urinary glomerular biomarkers  and three urinary tubular biomarkers .

these biomarkers were measured in two groups of dogs with canine leishmaniosis at iris stage i. group 1: dogs showing proteinuria  before treatment which did not decrease after treatment; group 2: dogs showing proteinuria before treatment which decreased after treatment.


RESULTS
group  <dig> showed no significant changes in any biomarker after treatment. in group  <dig>  among the biomarkers recommended by the iris, only upc showed a significant decrease after treatment. however all biomarkers of glomerular damage showed a significant decrease after treatment, with uigg/cr and ucrp/cr showing the greater decreases. in addition urbp/cr and unag/cr showed significant decreases after treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
in dogs with leishmaniosis at iris stage i that reduced upc after treatment, there were no significant changes in serum creatinine and ssdma. however, all the urine biomarkers evaluated with exception of uggt showed a significant decrease. these decreases were more evident in those markers related with glomerular function, being uigg/cr the biomarker more associated with upc. further studies involving a larger number of animals and histological analysis of the kidney would be recommended to confirm these findings and evaluate the routine practical use of these urine biomarkers in canine leishmaniosis.
