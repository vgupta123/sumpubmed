BACKGROUND
despite a high genetic similarity to peach, almonds  have a fleshless fruit and edible kernel, produced as a crop for human consumption. while the release of peach genome v <dig>  provides an excellent opportunity for almond genetic and genomic studies, well-assessed segregating populations and the respective saturated genetic linkage maps lay the foundation for such studies to be completed in almond.


RESULTS
using an almond intraspecific cross between 'nonpareil' and 'lauranne' , we constructed a moderately saturated map with ssrs, snps, issrs and rapds. the n × l map covered  <dig>  cm of the genome with  <dig> loci. the average marker distance of the map was  <dig>  cm. the map displayed high synteny and colinearity with the prunus t × e reference map in all eight linkage groups . the positions of  <dig> mapped gene-anchored snps corresponded approximately with the positions of homologous sequences in the peach genome v <dig> . analysis of mendelian segregation ratios showed that  <dig> % of markers had significantly skewed genotype ratios at the level of p <  <dig> . due to the large number of skewed markers in the linkage group  <dig>  the potential existence of deleterious gene was assessed in the group. integrated maps produced by two different mapping methods using joinmap®  <dig> were compared, and their high degree of similarity was evident despite the positional inconsistency of a few markers.


CONCLUSIONS
we presented a moderately saturated australian almond map, which is highly syntenic and collinear with the prunus reference map and peach genome v <dig> . therefore, the well-assessed almond population reported here can be used to investigate the traits of interest under australian growing conditions, and provides more information on the almond genome for the international community.
