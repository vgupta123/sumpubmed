BACKGROUND
the amyloid precursor protein  is a key molecule in alzheimer disease. its localization at the cell surface can trigger downstream signaling and app cleavages. app trafficking to the cell surface in neurons is not clearly understood and may be related to the interactions with its partners. in this respect, by having homologies with kinesin light chain domains and because of its capacity to bind app, pat <dig> represents a good candidate.


RESULTS
we observed that pat <dig> binds poorly app at the cell surface of primary cortical neurons contrary to cytoplasmic app. using down and up-regulation of pat <dig>  we observed respectively an increase and decrease of app at the cell surface. the increase of app at the cell surface induced by low levels of pat <dig> did not trigger cell death signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that pat <dig> slows down app trafficking to the cell surface in primary cortical neurons. our results contribute to the elucidation of mechanisms involved in app trafficking in alzheimer disease.
