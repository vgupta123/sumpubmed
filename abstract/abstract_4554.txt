BACKGROUND
rice is a major staple food crop in the world. over 80 % of rice cultivation area is under indica rice. currently, genomic resources are lacking for indica as compared to japonica rice. in this study, we generated deep-sequencing data  for one of the indica rice cultivars, hr- <dig> from india.


RESULTS
we assembled over 86 %  of rice genome and annotated  <dig>  protein-coding genes from hr- <dig> genome using illumina and pacbio sequencing. comprehensive comparative analyses between indica and japonica subspecies genomes revealed a large number of indica specific variants including ssrs, snps and indels. to mine disease resistance genes, we sequenced few indica rice cultivars that are reported to be highly resistant  and susceptible  against blast fungal isolates in many countries including india. whole genome sequencing of rice genotypes revealed high rate of mutations in defense related genes  in resistant cultivars as compared to susceptible. this study has identified r-genes pi-ta and pi <dig> from durable indica resistant cultivars; tetep and tadukan, which can be used in marker assisted selection in rice breeding program.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of whole genome sequencing approach to characterize indian rice germplasm. the genomic resources from our work will have a greater impact in understanding global rice diversity, genetics and molecular breeding.
