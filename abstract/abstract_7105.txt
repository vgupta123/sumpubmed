BACKGROUND
in insects, circadian clocks play a key role in enhancing fitness by regulating life history traits such as developmental time and adult lifespan. these clocks use environmental light/dark  cycles to fine-tune a wide range of behavioral and physiological processes. to study the effect of environmental ld conditions on pre-adult fitness components, we used two dark-dwelling sympatric species of ants , which normally develop underground and have fairly long pre-adult developmental time.


RESULTS
our results suggest that ants develop fastest as pre-adults when maintained under constant light , followed closely by 12: <dig> hr light/dark , and then constant darkness . while light exposure alters developmental rates of almost all stages of development, the overall pre-adult development in ll is speeded-up  by ~37%  in c. compressus and by ~35%  in c. paria. in ld too, development is faster  by ~29%  in c. compressus and by ~28%  in c. paria. pre-adult viability of both species is also higher under ll and ld compared to dd. while pre-adult development time and viability is enhanced in ll and ld, clutch-size undergoes reduction, at least in c. compressus.


CONCLUSIONS
exposure to light enhances pre-adult fitness in two dark-dwelling species of camponotus by speeding-up development and by enhancing viability. this suggests that social ants use environmental light/dark cycles to modulate key life history traits such as pre-adult development time and viability.
