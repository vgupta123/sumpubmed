BACKGROUND
retinoic acid  is a biologically active derivative of vitamin a. previous studies have demonstrated that ra has protective effects against damage caused by h2o <dig> or oxygen-glucose deprivation in mesangial and pc <dig> cells. pretreatment with 9-cis-retinoic acid  reduced infarction and tunel labeling in cerebral cortex as well as attenuated neurological deficits after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. the purpose of this study was to examine a protective role of 9cra in dopaminergic  neurons in a typical rodent model of parkinson’s disease .


RESULTS
the protective role of 9cra was first examined in rat primary ventromesencephalic culture. treatment with 9cra significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamine -mediated cell death and tunel labeling in cultured dopaminergic neurons. the protective effect was also examined in adult male rats. animals received unilateral 6-ohda lesioning at the left medial forebrain bundle on day  <dig>  methamphetamine -induced rotational behavior was examined on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after lesioning. animals were separated into  <dig> groups to balance rotational behavior and lesion extent on day  <dig> and were treated with either 9cra or vehicle . post-treatment with 9cra significantly reduced methamphetamine –mediated ipislateral rotation at  <dig> and  <dig> days after lesioning. in vivo voltammetry was used to examine da overflow in striatum. treatment with 9cra significantly increased kcl -evoked da release in the lesioned striatum. 9cra also increased tyrosine hydroxylase  cell number in the lesioned nigra as determined by unbiased stereology.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that early post-treatment with 9cra has a protective effect against neurodegeneration in nigrostriatal da neurons in an animal model of pd.
