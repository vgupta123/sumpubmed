BACKGROUND
anguillicola crassus is an economically and ecologically important parasitic nematode of eels. the native range of a. crassus is in east asia, where it infects anguilla japonica, the japanese eel. a. crassus was introduced into european eels, anguilla anguilla,  <dig> years ago. the parasite is more pathogenic in its new host than in its native one, and is thought to threaten the endangered an. anguilla across its range. the molecular bases for the increased pathogenicity of the nematodes in their new hosts is not known.


RESULTS
a reference transcriptome was assembled for a. crassus from roche  <dig> pyrosequencing data. raw reads  from nematodes from an. japonica and an. anguilla hosts were filtered for likely host contaminants and ribosomal rnas. the remaining  <dig>  reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs of a high confidence assembly  and an additional  <dig>  singletons and contigs of a lower confidence assembly . roughly 55% of the high confidence assembly contigs were annotated with domain- or protein sequence similarity derived functional information. sequences conserved only in nematodes, or unique to a. crassus were more likely to have secretory signal peptides. thousands of high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, and coding polymorphism was correlated with differential expression between individual nematodes. transcripts identified as being under positive selection were enriched in peptidases. enzymes involved in energy metabolism were enriched in the set of genes differentially expressed between european and asian a. crassus.


CONCLUSIONS
the reference transcriptome of a. crassus is of high quality, and will serve as a basis for future work on the invasion biology of this important parasite. the polymorphisms identified will provide a key tool set for analysis of population structure and identification of genes likely to be involved in increased pathogenicity in european eel hosts. the identification of peptidases under positive selection is a first step in this programme.
