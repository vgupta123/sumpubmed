BACKGROUND
high-pathogenic y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica caused several human outbreaks in northern america. in contrast, low pathogenic y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype o:3/ <dig> is responsible for sporadic cases worldwide with asymptomatic pigs being the main source of infection. genomes of three y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype o:3/ <dig> human isolates  were compared to the high-pathogenic y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica  <dig> o:8/1b to address the peculiarities of the o:3/ <dig> group.


RESULTS
most high-pathogenicity-associated determinants of y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica  are absent in y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype o:3/ <dig> genomes. on the other hand they possess alternative putative virulence and fitness factors, such as a different ysp type  <dig> secretion system, an rtxa-like and insecticidal toxins, and a n-acetyl-galactosamine  pts system . horizontal acquisition of two prophages and a trna-asn-associated giyep- <dig> genomic island might also influence the y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype o:3/ <dig> pathoadaptation. we demonstrated recombination activity of the phiyep- <dig> prophage and the giyep- <dig> island and the ability of the aga-operon to support the growth of the y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica o:8/1b on galnac.


CONCLUSIONS
y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype o:3/ <dig> experienced a shift to an alternative patchwork of virulence and fitness determinants that might play a significant role in its host pathoadaptation and successful worldwide dissemination.
