BACKGROUND
the reliable prediction of protein tertiary structure from the amino acid sequence remains challenging even for small proteins. we have developed an all-atom free-energy protein forcefield  that we could use to fold several small proteins from completely extended conformations. because the computational cost of de-novo folding studies rises steeply with system size, this approach is unsuitable for structure prediction purposes. we therefore investigate here a low-cost free-energy relaxation protocol for protein structure prediction that combines heuristic methods for model generation with all-atom free-energy relaxation in pff <dig> 


RESULTS
we use pff <dig> to rank and cluster the conformations for  <dig> proteins generated by rosetta. for 22/ <dig> high-quality/low quality decoy sets we select near-native conformations with an average cα root mean square deviation of  <dig>  Å/ <dig>  Å. the protocol incorporates an inherent reliability indicator that succeeds for 78% of the decoy sets. in over 90% of these cases near-native conformations are selected from the decoy set. this success rate is rationalized by the quality of the decoys and the selectivity of the pff <dig> forcefield, which ranks near-native conformations an average  <dig>  standard deviations below that of the relaxed decoys .


CONCLUSIONS
all-atom free-energy relaxation with pff <dig> emerges as a powerful low-cost approach toward generic de-novo protein structure prediction. the approach can be applied to large all-atom decoy sets of any origin and requires no preexisting structural information to identify the native conformation. the study provides evidence that a large class of proteins may be foldable by pff <dig>
