BACKGROUND
human enterovirus  <dig>  is a common causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease . in recent years, the virus has caused several outbreaks with high numbers of deaths and severe neurological complications. several new ev- <dig> subgenotypes were identified from these outbreaks. the mechanisms that contributed to the emergence of these subgenotypes are unknown.


RESULTS
six ev- <dig> isolates from an outbreak in malaysia, in  <dig>  were sequenced completely. these isolates were identified as ev- <dig> subgenotypes, b <dig>  b <dig> and c <dig>  a phylogenetic tree that correlated well with the present enterovirus classification scheme was established using these full genome sequences and all other available full genome sequences of ev- <dig> and human enterovirus a . using the 5' utr, p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions, however, isolates of ev- <dig> subgenotypes b <dig> and c <dig> segregated away from other ev- <dig> subgenotypes into a cluster together with coxsackievirus a <dig>  and ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> clustered with cv-a <dig>  results from the similarity plot analyses supported the clustering of these isolates with other hev-a. in contrast, at the same genomic regions, a cv-a <dig> isolate, tainan <dig>  clustered with ev- <dig>  this suggests that amongst ev- <dig> and cv-a <dig>  only the structural genes were conserved. the 3' end of the virus genome varied and consisted of sequences highly similar to various hev-a viruses. numerous recombination crossover breakpoints were identified within the non-structural genes of some of these newer ev- <dig> subgenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic evidence obtained from analyses of the full genome sequence supports the possible occurrence of inter-typic recombination involving ev- <dig> and various hev-a, including cv-a <dig>  the most common causal agent of hfmd. it is suggested that these recombination events played important roles in the emergence of the various ev- <dig> subgenotypes.
