BACKGROUND
microarray gene expression data are accumulating in public databases. the expression profiles contain valuable information for understanding human gene expression patterns. however, the effective use of public microarray data requires integrating the expression profiles from heterogeneous sources.


RESULTS
in this study, we have compiled a compendium of microarray expression profiles of various human tissue samples. the microarray raw data generated in different research laboratories have been obtained and combined into a single dataset after data normalization and transformation. to demonstrate the usefulness of the integrated microarray data for studying human gene expression patterns, we have analyzed the dataset to identify potential tissue-selective genes. a new method has been proposed for genome-wide identification of tissue-selective gene targets using both microarray intensity values and detection calls. the candidate genes for brain, liver and testis-selective expression have been examined, and the results suggest that our approach can select some interesting gene targets for further experimental studies.


CONCLUSIONS
a computational approach has been developed in this study for combining microarray expression profiles from heterogeneous sources. the integrated microarray data can be used to investigate tissue-selective expression patterns of human genes.
