BACKGROUND
despite intense investment growth and technology development, there is an observed bottleneck in drug discovery and development over the past decade. nih started the molecular libraries initiative  in  <dig> to enlarge the pool for potential drug targets, especially from the “undruggable” part of human genome, and potential drug candidates from much broader types of drug-like small molecules. all results are being made publicly available in a web portal called pubchem.


RESULTS
in this paper we construct a network from bioassay data in pubchem, apply network biology concepts to characterize this bioassay network, integrate information from multiple biological databases , and systematically analyze the potential of bioassay targets being new drug targets in the context of complex biological networks. we propose a model to quantitatively prioritize this druggability of bioassay targets, and literature evidence was found to confirm our prioritization of bioassay targets at a roughly 70% accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis provide some measures of the value of the mli data as a resource for both basic chemical biology research and future therapeutic discovery.
