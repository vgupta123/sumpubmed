BACKGROUND
the ectoparasitic mite varroa destructor has emerged as the primary pest of domestic honey bees . here we present an initial survey of the v. destructor genome carried out to advance our understanding of varroa biology and to identify new avenues for mite control. this sequence survey provides immediate resources for molecular and population-genetic analyses of varroa-apis interactions and defines the challenges ahead for a comprehensive varroa genome project.


RESULTS
the genome size was estimated by flow cytometry to be  <dig> mbp, larger than most sequenced insects but modest relative to some other acari. genomic dna pooled from ~ <dig>  mites was sequenced to  <dig> × coverage with  <dig> pyrosequencing. the  <dig>  gbp of sequencing reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, totaling  <dig> mbp of sequence after filtering. genic sequences with homology to other eukaryotic genomes were identified on  <dig>  of these contigs, totaling  <dig>  mbp. alignment of protein sequence blocks conserved among v. destructor and four other arthropod genomes indicated a higher level of sequence divergence within this mite lineage relative to the tick ixodes scapularis. a number of microbes potentially associated with v. destructor were identified in the sequence survey, including ~ <dig> kbp of sequence deriving from one or more bacterial species of the actinomycetales. the presence of this bacterium was confirmed in individual mites by pcr assay, but varied significantly by age and sex of mites. fragments of a novel virus related to the baculoviridae were also identified in the survey. the rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the pooled mites was estimated to be  <dig>  × 10-5per bp, a low rate consistent with the historical demography and life history of the species.


CONCLUSIONS
this survey has provided general tools for the research community and novel directions for investigating the biology and control of varroa mites. ongoing development of varroa genomic resources will be a boon for comparative genomics of under-represented arthropods, and will further enhance the honey bee and its associated pathogens as a model system for studying host-pathogen interactions.
