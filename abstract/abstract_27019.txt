BACKGROUND
the west nile virus  nonstructural protein  <dig>  is an important antigenic protein that elicits protective antibody responses in animals and can be used for the serological diagnosis of wnv infection. although previous work has demonstrated the vital role of wnv ns1-specific antibody responses, the specific epitopes in the ns <dig> have not been identified.


RESULTS
the present study describes the identification of two linear b-cell epitopes in wnv ns <dig> through screening a phage-displayed random 12-mer peptide library with two monoclonal antibodies  3c <dig> and 4d <dig> that directed against the ns <dig>  the mabs 3c <dig> and 4d <dig> recognized phages displaying peptides with the consensus motifs ltattek and vvdgpetkec, respectively. exact sequences of both motifs were found in the ns <dig> . further identification of the displayed b cell epitopes were conducted using a set of truncated peptides expressed as mbp fusion proteins. the data indicated that 896tattek <dig> and925vvdgpetkec <dig> are minimal determinants of the linear b cell epitopes recognized by the mabs 3c <dig> and 4d <dig>  respectively. antibodies present in the serum of wnv-positive horses recognized the minimal linear epitopes in western blot analysis, indicating that the two peptides are antigenic in horses during infection. furthermore, we found that the epitope recognized by 3c <dig> is conserved only among wnv strains, whereas the epitope recognized by 4d <dig> is a common motif shared among wnv and other members of japanese encephalitis virus  serocomplex.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified tattek and vvdgpetkec as ns1-specific linear b-cell epitopes recognized by the mabs 3c <dig> and 4d <dig>  respectively. the knowledge and reagents generated in this study may have potential applications in differential diagnosis and the development of epitope-based marker vaccines against wnv and other viruses of jev serocomplex.
