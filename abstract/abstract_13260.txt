BACKGROUND
sesame  is one of the most important oilseed crops with high oil contents and rich nutrient value. however, genetic improvement efforts in sesame could not get benefit from molecular biology technology due to poor dna and rna sequence resources. in this study, we carried out a large scale of expressed sequence tags  sequencing from developing sesame seeds and further conducted analysis on seed storage products-related genes.


RESULTS
a normalized and full-length enriched cdna library from  <dig> ~  <dig> days old immature seeds was constructed and randomly sequenced, leading to generation of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  which then formed  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons with  <dig> % uniests being putative full-length open reading frames. approximately  <dig>  of all these uniests have significant matches to the counterparts in nr database of genbank, and  <dig>  of them were assigned to one or more gene ontology  terms. homologous genes involved in oil biosynthesis were identified including some conservative transcription factors regulating oil biosynthesis such as leafy cotyledon <dig> , pickle , wrinkled <dig>  and majority of them were found for the first time in sesame seeds. one hundred and  <dig> ests were identified possibly involved in biosynthesis of sesame lignans, sesamin and sesamolin. in total,  <dig>  putative functional genes from developing seeds were identified, which accounts for one third of total genes in the sesame genome. further analysis of the uniests identified  <dig>  non-redundant simple sequence repeats .


CONCLUSIONS
this study has provided an overview of genes expressed during sesame seed development. this collection of sesame full-length cdnas covered a wide variety of genes in seeds, in particular, candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of sesame oils and lignans. these est sequences enriched with full length will contribute to comparative genomic studies on sesame and other oilseed plants and serve as an abundant information platform for functional marker development and functional gene study.
