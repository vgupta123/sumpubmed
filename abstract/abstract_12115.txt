BACKGROUND
dental pulp stem/stromal cells  are categorized as adult stem cells  that retain multipotent differentiation capabilities. dpscs can be isolated from individuals at any age and are considered to be true personal stem cells, making dpscs one of the potential options for stem cell therapy. however, the properties of dpscs from individuals with an inherited genetic disorder, such as huntington's disease , have not been fully investigated.


RESULTS
to examine if mutant huntingtin  protein impacts dpsc properties, we have established dpscs from tooth germ of transgenic monkeys that expressed both mutant htt and green fluorescent protein  genes , and from a monkey that expressed only the gfp gene , which served as a control. although mutant htt and oligomeric htt aggregates were overtly present in rhd/g-dpscs, all rhd/g-dpscs and rg-dpscs shared similar characteristics, including self-renewal, multipotent differentiation capabilities, expression of stemness and differentiation markers, and cell surface antigen profile.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that dpscs from huntington monkeys retain asc properties. thus dpscs derived from individuals with genetic disorders such as hd could be a potential source of personal stem cells for therapeutic purposes.
