BACKGROUND
stable isotope ratios  in fossil teeth and bone provide key archives for understanding the ecology of extinct horses during the plio-pleistocene in south america; however, what happened in areas of sympatry between equus  and hippidion is less understood.


RESULTS
here, we use stable carbon and oxygen isotopes preserved in  <dig> fossil tooth and bone samples for seven species of horses from  <dig> different localities to document the magnitude of the dietary shifts of horses and ancient floral change during the plio-pleistocene. dietary reconstructions inferred from stable isotopes of both genera of horses present in south america document dietary separation and environmental changes in ancient ecosystems, including c3/c <dig> transitions. stable isotope data demonstrate changes in c <dig> grass consumption, inter-species dietary partitioning and variation in isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders with latitudinal gradient.


CONCLUSIONS
the data for hippidion indicate a preference varying from c <dig> plants to mixed c3-c <dig> plants in their diet. equus  shows three different patterns of dietary partitioning equus  neogeus from the province of buenos aires indicate a preference for c <dig> plants in the diet. equus  andium from ecuador and equus  insulatus from bolivia show a preference for to a diet of mixed c3-c <dig> plants, while equus  santaeelenae from la carolina  and brazil are mostly c <dig> feeders. these results confirm that ancient feeding ecology cannot always be inferred from dental morphology. while the carbon isotope composition of horses skeletal material decreased as latitude increased, we found evidence of boundary between a mixed c3/c <dig> diet signal and a pure c <dig> signal around 32° s and a change from a mixed diet signal to an exclusively c <dig> signal around 35°s.

we found that the horses living at high altitudes and at low to middle latitude still have a c <dig> component in their diet, except the specimens from  <dig> m, which have a pure c <dig> diet. the change in altitudinal vegetation gradients during the pleistocene is one of several possibilities to explain the c <dig> dietary component in horses living at high altitudes. other alternative explanations imply that the horses fed partially at lower altitudes.
