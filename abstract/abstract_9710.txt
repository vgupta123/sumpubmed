BACKGROUND
china, with around  <dig> unique breeds, has a diverse duck genetic pool. currently, there is no systematic report which investigates the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship, and matrilineal genetic structure of these domestic breeds and wild mallards .


RESULTS
in this study, we sequenced the mitochondrial dna  control region segments in  <dig> domestic ducks  from  <dig> indigenous breeds/populations and  <dig> wild mallard samples and analyzed them together with the  <dig> control region sequences from published sources. fifty-two samples were then sequenced for a cytochrome b  gene fragment to solidify the pattern emerged from the control region sequences. all domestic duck and wild mallard haplotypes were essentially indistinguishable and were clustered together in the phylogenetic tree. there was no geographic differentiation and breed/population-specific distribution of duck lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that unlike other domesticated farm animals in china such as chicken, cattle, goat, and yak with multiple matrilineal components, the matrilineal pool of chinese ducks was homogenous.
