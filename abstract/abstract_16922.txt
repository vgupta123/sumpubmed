BACKGROUND
today, sequencing is frequently carried out by massive parallel sequencing  that cuts drastically sequencing time and expenses. nevertheless, sanger sequencing remains the main validation method to confirm the presence of variants. the analysis of mps data involves the development of several bioinformatic tools, academic or commercial. we present here a statistical method to compare mps pipelines and test it in a comparison between an academic  and a commercial pipeline , with and without reference to a gold standard , on a panel of  <dig> genes in  <dig> epileptic patients. this method used the number of variants to fit log-linear models for pairwise agreements between pipelines. to assess the heterogeneity of the margins and the odds ratios of agreement, four log-linear models were used: a full model, a homogeneous-margin model, a model with single odds ratio for all patients, and a model with single intercept. then a log-linear mixed model was fitted considering the biological variability as a random effect.


RESULTS
among the  <dig>  base-pairs sequenced, tmap-nextgene® and bwa-gatk found, on average,  <dig>  and  <dig>  variants , respectively. against the gold standard, the pipelines had similar sensitivities  and close but significantly different specificities . same-trend results were obtained when only single nucleotide variants were considered .


CONCLUSIONS
the method allows thus pipeline comparison and selection. it is generalizable to all types of mps data and all pipelines.
