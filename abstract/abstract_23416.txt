BACKGROUND
the active form of vitamin d,  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> , has strong anti-proliferative effects, yet the molecular mechanisms underneath this effect remain unclear. in contrast, the molecular mechanism of  <dig> d for the regulation of calcium homeostasis has principally been resolved, demonstrating a pivotal role for the vitamin d receptor .


RESULTS
we first addressed the question whether the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d are influenced by vdr. knockdown of vdr by sirna did not affect the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d in mcf <dig> breast cancer cells. this unanticipated finding led us to take an alternative approach using genome wide screens to study the molecular mechanisms of  <dig> d in proliferation. for that purpose, four independently developed and stable  <dig> d resistant mcf <dig> cell lines were analyzed. array cgh identified a copy number alteration in a region of  <dig>  mb at chromosome 11q <dig> - <dig>  common to all four  <dig> d resistant cell lines. expression arrays revealed that no single gene was differentially expressed between the sensitive and resistant cells, but multiple membrane receptor signaling pathways were altered in the  <dig> d resistant cell lines. importantly, in the genome wide experiments neither vdr, cyp24a <dig> nor other known vitamin d signaling pathway genes were associated with  <dig> d resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, sirna and genome wide studies both suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d in mcf <dig> breast tumor cell lines do not rely on classical vitamin d pathway per se.
