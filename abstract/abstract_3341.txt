BACKGROUND
salmonella is a common intestinal pathogen that causes acute and chronic inflammatory response. probiotics reduce inflammatory cytokine production and serve as beneficial commensal microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract. tgf-β /smad and nf-κb signaling play important roles in inflammation in intestinal cells. however, the involvement of the signaling in regulating inflammation between salmonella and probiotics is not fully understood.

methods
l. acidophilus and prebiotic inulin were used to treat human intestinal caco- <dig> cells prior to infection with salmonella. the cells were harvested to examine the cytokines and mir <dig> expression with immunoblotting and real-time pcr. nf-κb and smad3/ <dig> reporter vectors were transfected into cells to monitor inflammation and tgf-β <dig> signaling, respectively.


RESULTS
in this study, we showed that the probiotic l. acidophilus decreased salmonella-induced nf-κb activation in human intestinal caco- <dig> cells. expression of the inflammatory cytokines, tnf-α and il- <dig>  in l. acidophilus-pretreated cells was also significantly lower than that in cells infected with salmonella alone. moreover, tgf-β <dig> and mir <dig> expression was elevated in cells pretreated with l. acidophilus or synbiotic, a combination of inulin and l. acidophilus, compared to that in untreated cells or cells infected with s. typhimurium alone. by contrast, expression of smad <dig>  a target of mir <dig>  was accordingly reduced in cells treated with l. acidophilus or synbiotics. consistent with tgf-β1/mir <dig> and smad <dig> expression, smad3/ <dig> transcriptional activity was significantly higher in the cells treated with l. acidophilus or synbiotics. furthermore, tgf-β <dig> antibody antagonized the smad3/ <dig> and nf-κb transcriptional activity modulated by l. acidophilus in intestinal cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the tgf-β1/mir <dig> signaling pathway may be involved in the suppressive effects of l. acidophilus on inflammation caused by s. typhimurium in intestinal caco- <dig> cells.
