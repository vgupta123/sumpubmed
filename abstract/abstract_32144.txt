BACKGROUND
malaria is a tropical disease caused by protozoan parasite, plasmodium, which is transmitted to humans by various species of female anopheline mosquitoes. anopheles stephensi is one such major malaria vector in urban parts of the indian subcontinent. unlike anopheles gambiae, an african malaria vector, transcriptome of a. stephensi midgut tissue is less explored. we have therefore carried out generation, annotation, and analysis of expressed sequence tags from sugar-fed and plasmodium yoelii infected blood-fed  adult female a. stephensi midgut tissue.


RESULTS
we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> ests from the sugar-fed and p. yoelii infected mosquito midgut tissue libraries, respectively. ests from the combined dataset formed  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets, totaling to  <dig> unique transcripts. putative functions were assigned to  <dig>  transcripts using blastx against uniprotkb database. amongst unannotated transcripts, we identified  <dig> putative novel transcripts and  <dig> potential untranslated regions . statistical comparison of annotated and unannotated ests from the two libraries identified  <dig> differentially regulated genes. out of  <dig> unique transcripts, only  <dig> transcripts were mapped on the a. gambiae genome. these also included  <dig> novel transcripts, which were mapped to the unannotated regions of the genome. the est data is available as estdb at .


CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> unique transcripts were successfully identified from the adult female a. stephensi midgut tissue. these data can be used for microarray development for better understanding of vector-parasite relationship and to study differences or similarities with other malaria vectors. mapping of putative novel transcripts from a. stephensi on the a. gambiae genome proved fruitful in identification and annotation of several genes. failure of some novel transcripts to map on the a. gambiae genome indicates existence of substantial genomic dissimilarities between these two potent malaria vectors.
