BACKGROUND
to screen whether e. coli strains encoding type  <dig> fimbriae, isolated from fecal microflora, produce bacteriocins more often relative to fima-negative e. coli strains of similar origin.

methods
pcr assays were used to detect presence of genes encoding  <dig> bacteriocin determinants  and  <dig> virulence determinants in  <dig> e. coli strains of human and animal origin isolated from hospitals and animal facilities in the czech and slovak republic. e. coli strains were also classified into phylogroups .


RESULTS
fima-negative e. coli strains  were compared to fima-positive e. coli strains . strains with identified bacteriocin genes were more commonly found among fima-positive e. coli strains  compared to fima-negative e. coli strains  and this was true for both colicin and microcin determinants . in addition, an increased number of strains encoding colicin e <dig> were found among fima-positive e. coli strains .


CONCLUSIONS
fima-positive e. coli strains produced bacteriocins  more often compared to fima-negative strains of similar origin. since type  <dig> fimbriae of e. coli have been shown to mediate adhesion to epithelial host cells and help colonize the intestines, bacteriocin synthesis appears to be an additional feature of colonizing e. coli strains.
