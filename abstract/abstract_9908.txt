BACKGROUND
a major production constraint on the important ornamental species chrysanthemum is black spot which is caused by the necrotrophic fungus alternaria tenuissima. the molecular basis of host resistance to a. tenuissima has not been studied as yet in any detail. here, high throughput sequencing was taken to characterize the transcriptomic response of the chrysanthemum leaf to a. tenuissima inoculation.


RESULTS
the transcriptomic data was acquired using rna-seq technology, based on the illumina hiseqâ„¢  <dig> platform. four different libraries derived from two sets of leaves harvested from either inoculated or mock-inoculated plants were characterized. over seven million clean reads were generated from each library, each corresponding to a coverage of > <dig>  nt. about 70% of the reads could be mapped to a set of chrysanthemum unigenes. read frequency was used as a measure of transcript abundance and therefore as an identifier of differential transcription in the four libraries. the differentially transcribed genes identified were involved in photosynthesis, pathogen recognition, reactive oxygen species generation, cell wall modification and phytohormone signalling; in addition, a number of varied transcription factors were identified. a selection of  <dig> of the genes was transcription-profiled using quantitative rt-pcr to validate the rna-seq output.


CONCLUSIONS
a substantial body of chrysanthemum transcriptomic sequence was generated, which led to a number of insights into the molecular basis of the host response to a. tenuissima infection. although most of the differentially transcribed genes were up-regulated by the presence of the pathogen, those involved in photosynthesis were down-regulated.
