BACKGROUND
genome-wide screening in human and mouse cells using rna interference and open reading frame over-expression libraries is rapidly becoming a viable experimental approach for many research labs. there are a variety of gene expression modulation libraries commercially available, however, detailed and validated protocols as well as the reagents necessary for deconvolving genome-scale gene screens using these libraries are lacking. as a solution, we designed a comprehensive platform for highly multiplexed functional genetic screens in human, mouse and yeast cells using popular, commercially available gene modulation libraries. the gene modulation array platform  is a single microarray-based detection solution for deconvolution of loss and gain-of-function pooled screens.


RESULTS
experiments with specially constructed lentiviral-based plasmid pools containing ~ <dig>  shrnas demonstrated that the gmap is capable of deconvolving genome-wide shrna "dropout" screens. further experiments with a larger, ~ <dig>  shrna pool demonstrate that equivalent results are obtained from plasmid pools and from genomic dna derived from lentivirus infected cells. parallel testing of large shrna pools using gmap and next-generation sequencing methods revealed that the two methods provide valid and complementary approaches to deconvolution of genome-wide shrna screens. additional experiments demonstrated that gmap is equivalent to similar microarray-based products when used for deconvolution of open reading frame over-expression screens.


CONCLUSIONS
herein, we demonstrate four major applications for the gmap resource, including deconvolution of pooled rnai screens in cells with at least  <dig>  distinct shrnas. we also provide detailed methodologies for pooled shrna screen readout using gmap and compare next-generation sequencing to gmap  based deconvolution methods.
