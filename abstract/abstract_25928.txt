BACKGROUND
determination of protein-dna complex structures with both nmr and x-ray crystallography remains challenging in many cases. high ambiguity-driven docking  is an information-driven docking program that has been used to successfully model many protein-dna complexes. however, a protein-dna complex model whereby the protein wraps around dna has not been reported. defining the ambiguous interaction restraints for the classical three-cys2his <dig> zinc-finger proteins that wrap around dna is critical because of the complicated binding geometry. in this study, we generated a zif268-dna complex model using three different sets of ambiguous interaction restraints  to study the effect of the geometric distribution on the docking and used this approach to generate a newly reported sp1-dna complex model.


RESULTS
the complex models we generated on the basis of two airs with a good geometric distribution in each domain are reasonable in terms of the number of models with wrap-around conformation, interface root mean square deviation, air energy and fraction native contacts. we derived the modeling approach for generating a three-cys2his <dig> zinc-finger-dna complex model according to the results of docking studies using the zif268-dna and other three crystal complex structures. furthermore, the sp1-dna complex model was calculated with this approach, and the interactions between sp <dig> and dna are in good agreement with those previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
our docking data demonstrate that two airs with a reasonable geometric distribution in each of the three-cys2his <dig> zinc-finger domains are sufficient to generate an accurate complex model with protein wrapping around dna. this approach is efficient for generating a zinc-finger protein-dna complex model for unknown complex structures in which the protein wraps around dna. we provide a flowchart showing the detailed procedures of this approach.
