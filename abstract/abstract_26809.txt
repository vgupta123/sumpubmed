BACKGROUND
reproductive isolation  is widely accepted as an important "check point" in the diversification process, since it defines irreversible evolutionary trajectories. much less consensus exists about the processes that might drive ri. here, we employ a formal quantitative analysis of genetic interactions at several stages of divergence within the ring species complex ensatina eschscholtzii in order to assess the relative contribution of genetic and ecological divergence for the development of ri.


RESULTS
by augmenting previous genetic datasets and adding new ecological data, we quantify levels of genetic and ecological divergence between populations and test how they correlate with a restriction of genetic admixture upon secondary contact. our results indicate that the isolated effect of ecological divergence between parental populations does not result in reproductively isolated taxa, even when genetic transitions between parental taxa are narrow. instead, processes associated with overall genetic divergence are the best predictors of reproductive isolation, and when parental taxa diverge in nuclear markers we observe a complete cessation of hybridization, even to sympatric occurrence of distinct evolutionary lineages. although every parental population has diverged in mitochondrial dna, its degree of divergence does not predict the extent of ri.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that in ensatina, the evolutionary outcomes of ecological divergence differ from those of genetic divergence. while evident properties of taxa may emerge via ecological divergence, such as adaptation to local environment, ri is likely to be a byproduct of processes that contribute to overall genetic divergence, such as time in geographic isolation, rather than being a direct outcome of local adaptation.
