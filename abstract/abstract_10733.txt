BACKGROUND
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury may simultaneously result in functional variation of multiple genes/pathways. however, most prior time-sequence studies on its pathomechanism only focused on a single gene or pathway. our study aimed to systematically analyze the time-dependent variation in the expression of multiple pathways and networks within  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.


RESULTS
by uploading  <dig> ischemia-related genes into the metacore software, the variation in the expression of multiple pathways and networks in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury had been analyzed. the conserved tnfr1-signaling pathway, among the top  <dig> pathways, was consistently enriched in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups. three overlapping pathways were found between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups;  <dig> between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups; and  <dig> between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups. five,  <dig>  and  <dig> non-overlapping pathways were observed in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups, respectively. apart from pathways reported by earlier studies, we identified a novel pathway related to the time-dependent development of cerebral ischemia pathogenesis. the process of apoptosis stimulation by external signals, among the top  <dig> processes, was consistently enriched in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups;  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> processes overlapped between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups,  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups, and  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups, respectively. four,  <dig>  and  <dig> non-overlapping processes were found in  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups, respectively. the presence of apoptotic processes was observed in all the  <dig> groups; while anti-apoptotic processes only existed in  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups. additionally, according to node degree, network comparison identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> important genes or proteins  in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups, respectively. the jaccard similarity index revealed a higher level of similarity between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups than that between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups.


CONCLUSIONS
time-dependent treatment can be utilized to reduce apoptosis, which may activate anti-apoptotic pathways within  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. pathway and network analyses may help identify novel pathways and genes implicated in disease pathogenesis.
