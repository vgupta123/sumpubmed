BACKGROUND
the interactions of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms  are highly hypothesized to affect an individual's susceptibility to complex diseases. although many works have been done to identify and quantify the importance of multi-snp interactions, few of them could handle the genome wide data due to the combinatorial explosive search space and the difficulty to statistically evaluate the high-order interactions given limited samples.


RESULTS
three comparative experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of megasnphunter. the first experiment uses synthetic data generated on the basis of epistasis models. the second one uses a genome wide study on parkinson disease . the third one chooses the rheumatoid arthritis study from wellcome trust case control consortium  using affymetrix genechip 500k mapping array set. megasnphunter outperforms the best solution in this area and reports many potential interactions for the two real studies.


CONCLUSIONS
the experimental results on both synthetic data and two real data sets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the best solution that is currently available in handling large-scale snp data both in terms of speed and in terms of detection of potential interactions that were not identified before. to our knowledge, megasnphunter is the first approach that is capable of identifying the disease-associated snp interactions from wtccc studies and is promising for practical disease prognosis.
