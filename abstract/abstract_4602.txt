BACKGROUND
the c2h <dig> zinc-finger  containing gene family is one of the largest and most complex gene families in metazoan genomes. these genes are known to exist in almost all eukaryotes, and they constitute a major subset of eukaryotic transcription factors. the genes of this family usually occur as clusters in genomes and are thought to have undergone a massive expansion in vertebrates by multiple tandem duplication events .


RESULTS
in this study, we combined two popular approaches for homolog detection, reciprocal best hit   and hiddenâ€“markov model  profiles search , on a diverse set of complete genomes of  <dig> eukaryotic species ranging from excavates to humans to identify all detectable members of  <dig> c2h <dig> znf gene families. we succeeded in identifying  <dig>  genes as distinct members of  <dig> c2h <dig> gene families. these  <dig> families are distributed among the eukaryotes as progressive additions of gene blocks with increasing complexity of the organisms. the first block featuring the protists had  <dig> families, the second block featuring plants had  <dig> families, the third block featuring the fungi had  <dig> families  and the final block consisted of metazoans with  <dig> families. among the metazoans, the simpler unicellular metazoans had just  <dig> of the  <dig> families while most of the bilaterians had all  <dig> families making up a total of  <dig> families. multiple potential examples of lineage-specific gene duplications and gene losses were also observed.


CONCLUSIONS
our hybrid approach combines features of the both rbh and hmm methods for homolog detection. this largely automated technique is much faster than manual methods and is able to detect homologs accurately and efficiently among a diverse set of organisms. our analysis of the  <dig> evolutionarily conserved c2h <dig> znf gene families revealed a stepwise appearance of znf families, agreeing well with the phylogenetic relationship of the organisms compared and their presumed stepwise increase in complexity .
