BACKGROUND
vp <dig> of chicken anemia virus  is a dual-specificity phosphatase required for virus infection, assembly and replication. the functions of the nuclear localization signal  and nuclear export signal  of vp <dig> in the cell, however, are poorly understood. our study identified the presence of a nls in vp <dig> and showed that the protein interacted significantly with mini-chromosome maintenance protein  <dig>  in the cell.


RESULTS
an arginine-lysine rich nls could be predicted by software and spanned from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of vp <dig>  the critical amino acids residues between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and either residue  <dig> or  <dig> are important for nuclear import in mammalian cells based on systematic mutagenesis. a nes is also predicted in vp2; however the results suggest that no functional nes is present and that this protein is crm <dig> independent. it was also shown that vp <dig> is a chromatin binding protein and, notably, using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, it was found that vp <dig> association with mcm <dig> and that this interaction does not require dsp activity.


CONCLUSIONS
vp <dig> contains a nls that span from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  vp <dig> is a crm <dig> independent protein during nuclear export and associates with mcm <dig> in cells.
