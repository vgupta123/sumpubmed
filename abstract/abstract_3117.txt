BACKGROUND
in the context of tumor immunology, tumor cells have been shown to overexpress cd <dig>  an anti-phagocytic signal directed to macrophages to escape from phagocytosis by interacting with signal regulatory protein α sirpα.

in the present work, we designed polypurine reverse hoogsteen hairpins, pprhs, to silence the expression of cd <dig> in tumor cells and sirpα in macrophages with the aim to eliminate tumor cells by macrophages in co-culture experiments.

methods
thp- <dig> cells were differentiated to macrophages with pma. the mrna levels of differentiation markers cd <dig> and mcl- <dig> mrna and pro-inflammatory cytokines  were measured by qrt-pcr. the ability of pprhs to silence cd <dig> and sirpα was evaluated at the mrna level by qrt-pcr and at the protein level by western blot. macrophages were co-cultured with tumor cells in the presence of pprhs to silence cd <dig> and/or sirpα. cell viability was assessed by mtt assays.


RESULTS
thp- <dig> cells differentiated to macrophages with pma showed an increase in macrophage surface markers  and pro-inflammatory cytokines . pprhs were able to decrease both cd <dig> expression in mcf- <dig> cell line and sirpα expression in macrophages at the mrna and protein levels. in the presence of pprhs, mcf- <dig> cells were eliminated by macrophages in co-culture experiments, whereas they survived in the absence of pprhs.


CONCLUSIONS
our data support the usage of pprhs to diminish cd47/sirpα interaction by decreasing the expression of both molecules thus resulting in an enhanced killing of mcf- <dig> cells by macrophages, which might translate into beneficial effects in cancer therapy. these results indicate that pprhs could represent a new approach with immunotherapeutic applications.
