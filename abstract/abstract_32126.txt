BACKGROUND
for safe clinical application of engineered cartilage made from mesenchymal stem cells , molecular mechanisms for chondrogenic differentiation must be known in detail. changes in gene expression and extracellular matrix synthesis have been extensively studied, but the epigenomic modifications underlying these changes have not been described. to this end we performed whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing to quantify six histone modifications, reduced representation bisulphite sequencing to quantify dna methylation and mrna microarrays to quantify gene expression before and after 7Â days of chondrogenic differentiation of mscs in an alginate scaffold. to add to the clinical relevance of our observations, the study is based on primary bone marrow-derived mscs from four donors, allowing us to investigate inter-individual variations.


RESULTS
we see two levels of relationship between epigenetic marking and gene expression. first, a large number of genes ontogenetically linked to msc properties and the musculoskeletal system are epigenetically prepatterned by moderate changes in h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac near transcription start sites. most of these genes remain transcriptionally unaltered. second, transcriptionally upregulated genes, more closely associated with chondrogenesis, are marked by h3k36me <dig> in gene bodies, highly increased h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac on promoters and 5' end of genes, and increased h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> marking in at least one enhancer region per upregulated gene. within the 7-day time frame, changes in promoter dna methylation do not correlate significantly with changes in gene expression. inter-donor variability analysis shows high level of similarity between the donors for this data set.


CONCLUSIONS
histone modifications, rather than dna methylation, provide the primary epigenetic control of early differentiation of mscs towards the chondrogenic lineage.
