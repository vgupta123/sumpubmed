BACKGROUND
the nsaid mavacoxib  is a recently described selective cox- <dig> inhibitor used for the management of inflammatory disease in dogs. it has a long plasma half-life, requiring less frequent dosing and supporting increased owner compliance in treating their dogs. although the use of nsaids has been described in cancer treatment in dogs, there are no studies to date that have examined the utility of mavacoxib specifically.


RESULTS
in this study we compared the in vitro activity of a short-acting non-selective cox inhibitor  with mavacoxib, on cancer cell and cancer stem cell survival. we demonstrate that mavacoxib has a direct cell killing effect on cancer cells, increases apoptosis in cancer cells in a manner that may be independent of caspase activity, and has an inhibitory effect on cell migration. importantly, we demonstrate that cancer stem cells derived from osteosarcoma cell lines are sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of mavacoxib.


CONCLUSIONS
both nsaids can inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro. importantly, cancer stem cells derived from an osteosarcoma cell line are sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of mavacoxib. our results suggest that mavacoxib has anti-tumour effects and that this in vitro anti-cancer activity warrants further study.
