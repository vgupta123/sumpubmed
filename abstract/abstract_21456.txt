BACKGROUND
wax esters are important ingredients in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, lubricants and other chemical industries due to their excellent wetting property. since the naturally occurring wax esters are expensive and scarce, these esters can be produced by enzymatic alcoholysis of vegetable oils. in an enzymatic reaction, study on modeling and optimization of the reaction system to increase the efficiency of the process is very important. the classical method of optimization involves varying one parameter at a time that ignores the combined interactions between physicochemical parameters. rsm is one of the most popular techniques used for optimization of chemical and biochemical processes and anns are powerful and flexible tools that are well suited to modeling biochemical processes.


RESULTS
the coefficient of determination  and absolute average deviation  values between the actual and estimated responses were determined as  <dig> and  <dig>  for ann training set,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ann test set, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rsm training set respectively. the predicted optimum condition was: reaction time  <dig>  h, temperature  <dig> Â°c, amount of enzyme  <dig>  g, and substrate molar ratio 1: <dig> . the actual experimental percentage yield was  <dig> % at optimum condition, which compared well to the maximum predicted value by ann  and rsm . the order of effective parameters on wax ester percentage yield were; respectively, time with  <dig> %, temperature with  <dig> %, amount of enzyme with  <dig> % and substrate molar ratio with  <dig> %, whereas r <dig> and aad were determined as  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ann, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rsm respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
though both models provided good quality predictions in this study, yet the ann showed a clear superiority over rsm for both data fitting and estimation capabilities.
