BACKGROUND
the tousled like kinase 1b  is critical for dna repair and survival of cells. upon dna damage, chk <dig> phosphorylates tlk1b at s <dig> leading to its transient inhibition. once tlk1b regains its kinase activity it phosphorylates rad <dig> at s <dig>  in this work we investigated the significance of this mechanism by overexpressing mutant tlk1b in which the inhibitory phosphorylation site was eliminated.

results and discussion
these cells expressing tlk1b resistant to dna damage showed constitutive phosphorylation of rad <dig> s <dig> that occurred even in the presence of hydroxyurea , and this resulted in a delayed checkpoint recovery. one possible explanation was that premature phosphorylation of rad <dig> caused its dissociation from 9-1- <dig> at stalled replication forks, resulting in their collapse and prolonged activation of the s-phase checkpoint. we found that phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> results in its dissociation from chromatin and redistribution to the cytoplasm. this results in double stranded breaks formation with concomitant activation of atm and phosphorylation of h2ax. furthermore, a rad <dig>  phosphomimic mutant was exclusively localized to the cytoplasm and not the chromatin. another rad <dig> phosphomimic mutant , which is also a site phosphorylated by tlk <dig>  localized normally. in cells expressing the mutant tlk1b treated with hu, rad <dig> association with hus <dig> and wrn was greatly reduced, suggesting again that its phosphorylation causes its premature release from stalled forks.

conclusions
we propose that normally, the inactivation of tlk1b following replication arrest and genotoxic stress functions to allow the retention of 9-1- <dig> at the sites of damage or stalled forks. following reactivation of tlk1b, whose synthesis is concomitantly induced by genotoxins, rad <dig> is hyperphosphorylated at s <dig>  resulting in its dissociation and inactivation of the checkpoint that occurs once repair is complete.
