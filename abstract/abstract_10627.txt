BACKGROUND
the filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii grows into a multicellular mycelium that is distinct from the unicellular morphology of its closely related yeast species. it has been proposed that genes important for cell cycle regulation play central roles for such phenotypic differences. because a. gossypii shares an almost identical set of cell cycle genes with the typical yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the differences might occur at the level of orthologous gene regulation. codon usage patterns were compared to identify orthologous genes with different gene regulation between a. gossypii and nine closely related yeast species.


RESULTS
here we identified  <dig>  orthologous genes between a. gossypii and nine yeast species. two groups of genes with significant differences in codon usage  were identified between a. gossypii and yeasts.  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes  have significantly higher translation efficiency in a. gossypii and yeasts, respectively. functional enrichment and pathway analysis show that group i genes are significantly enriched with cell cycle functions whereas group ii genes are biased toward metabolic functions.


CONCLUSIONS
because translation efficiency of a gene is closely related to its functional importance, the observed functional distributions of orthologous genes with different translation efficiency might account for phenotypic differentiation between a. gossypii and yeast species. the results shed light on the mechanisms for pseudohyphal growth in pathogenic yeast species.
