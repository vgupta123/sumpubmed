BACKGROUND
speckles in ultrasound imaging affect image quality and can make the post-processing difficult. speckle reduction technologies have been employed for removing speckles for some time. one of the effective speckle reduction technologies is anisotropic diffusion. anisotropic diffusion technology can remove the speckles effectively while preserving the edges of the image and thus has drawn great attention from image processing scientists. however, the proposed methods in the past have different disadvantages, such as being sensitive to the number of iterations or low capability of preserving the details of the ultrasound images. thus a detail preserved anisotropic diffusion speckle reduction with less sensitive to the number of iterations is needed. this paper aims to develop this kind of technologies.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a robust detail preserving anisotropic diffusion filter  for speckle reduction. in order to get robust diffusion, the proposed method integrates tukey error norm function into the detail preserving anisotropic diffusion filter  developed recently. the proposed method could prohibit over-diffusion and thus is less sensitive to the number of iterations


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed anisotropic diffusion can preserve the important structure information of the original image while reducing speckles. it is also less sensitive to the number of iterations. experimental results on real ultrasound images show the effectiveness of the proposed anisotropic diffusion filter.
