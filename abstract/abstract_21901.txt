BACKGROUND
odor transduction, occurring in the chemosensory cilia of vertebrate olfactory sensory neurons, is triggered by guanosine triphosphate-coupled odor receptors and mediated by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate  signaling cascade, where camp opens cationic non-selective cyclic nucleotide-gated  channels. calcium enters through cng gates ca2+-activated cl− channels, allowing a cl− inward current that enhances the depolarization initiated by the cng-dependent inward current. the anoctamin channel  <dig>  ano <dig>  is considered the main ca2+-activated cl− channel of olfactory transduction. although ca2+-activated cl− channel-dependent currents in olfactory sensory neurons were reported to be suppressed in ano2-knockout mice, field potentials from their olfactory epithelium were only modestly diminished and their smell-dependent behavior was unaffected, suggesting the participation of additional ca2+-activated cl− channel types. the bestrophin channel  <dig>  best <dig>  was also detected in mouse olfactory cilia and clca4l, belonging to the clca family of ca2+-activated cl− channels, were found in rat cilia. best <dig> knock-out mice present no electrophysiological or behavioral impairment, while the clca channels have not been functionally studied; therefore, the overall participation of all these channels in olfactory transduction remains unresolved.


RESULTS
we explored the presence of detectable ca2+-activated cl− channels in toad olfactory cilia by recording from inside-out membrane patches excised from individual cilia and detected unitary cl− current events with a pronounced ca2+ dependence, corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> ps conductances, over tenfold higher than the aforementioned channels, and a approx. fivefold higher ca2+ affinity . remarkably, we observed immunoreactivity to anti-clca and anti-ano <dig> antibodies in the olfactory cilia, suggesting a possible cooperative function of both channel type in chemotransduction.


CONCLUSIONS
these results are consistent with a novel olfactory cilia channel, which might play a role in odor transduction.
