BACKGROUND
apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is regulated by the bcl- <dig> family and caspase family of proteins. the caspase cascade responsible for executing cell death following cytochrome c release is well described; however the distinct roles of caspases- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> during this process are not completely defined.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate several unique functions for each of these caspases during cell death. specific inhibition of caspase- <dig> allows for efficient release of cytochrome c, but blocks changes in mitochondrial morphology and ros production. we show that caspase- <dig> can cleave bid into tbid at amino acid  <dig> and that this cleavage of bid is required for ros production following serum withdrawal. we also demonstrate that caspase-3-deficient mefs are less sensitive to intrinsic cell death stimulation, yet have higher ros production. in contrast, caspase-7-deficient mefs are not resistance to intrinsic cell death, but remain attached to the ecm.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data suggest that caspase- <dig> is required for mitochondrial morphological changes and ros production by cleaving and activating bid into tbid. after activation by caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig> inhibits ros production and is required for efficient execution of apoptosis, while effector caspase- <dig> is required for apoptotic cell detachment.
