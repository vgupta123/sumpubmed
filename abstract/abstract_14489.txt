BACKGROUND
along with obesity, physical inactivity, and family history of metabolic disorders, african american ethnicity is a risk factor for type  <dig> diabetes  in the united states. however, little is known about the differences in gene expression and transcriptomic profiles of blood in t2d between african americans  and caucasians , and microarray analysis of peripheral white blood cells  from these two ethnic groups will facilitate our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism in t2d and identify genetic biomarkers responsible for the disparities.


RESULTS
a whole human genome oligomicroarray of peripheral wbcs was performed on  <dig> samples obtained from  <dig> patients with t2d  and  <dig> healthy controls . the results showed that  <dig> genes had significant difference in expression between patients and controls . these known genes were mainly clustered in three functional categories: immune responses, lipid metabolism, and organismal injury/abnormaly. transcriptomic analysis also showed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in aa diseased versus aa control, compared to  <dig> genes in cau subjects. pathway study revealed that "communication between innate and adaptive immune cells"/"primary immunodeficiency signaling" are significantly down-regulated in aa patients and "interferon signaling"/"complement system" are significantly down-regulated in cau patients.


CONCLUSIONS
these newly identified genetic markers in wbcs provide valuable information about the pathophysiology of t2d and can be used for diagnosis and pharmaceutical drug design. our results also found that aa and cau patients with t2d express genes and pathways differently.
