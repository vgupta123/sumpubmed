BACKGROUND
bladder pain is a prominent symptom in several urological conditions . understanding the mechanism of bladder pain is important, particularly when the pain is not accompanied by bladder pathology. stimulation of protease activated receptor  <dig>  in the urothelium results in bladder pain through release of urothelial high mobility group box- <dig> . hgmb <dig> has two functionally active redox states  and it is not known which form elicits bladder pain. therefore, we investigated whether intravesical administration of specific hmgb <dig> redox forms caused abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity, micturition changes, and bladder inflammation in female c57bl/ <dig> mice 24 hours post-administration. moreover, we determined which of the specific hmgb <dig> receptors, toll-like receptor  <dig>  or receptor for advanced glycation end products , mediate hmgb1-induced changes.


RESULTS
disulfide hmgb <dig> elicited abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity 24 hours after intravesical  instillation. in contrast, all-thiol hmgb <dig> did not produce abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity in any of the doses tested . both hmgb <dig> redox forms caused micturition changes only at the highest dose tested  while eliciting mild bladder edema and reactive changes at all doses. we subsequently tested whether the effects of intravesical disulfide hmgb <dig>  were prevented by systemic  or local  administration of either a tlr <dig> antagonist  or a rage antagonist . systemic administration of either tak- <dig>  or fps-zm <dig>  prevented hmgb <dig> induced abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity while only intravesical tlr <dig> antagonist pretreatment  had this effect.


CONCLUSIONS
the disulfide form of hmgb <dig> mediates bladder pain directly  through activation of tlr <dig> receptors in the bladder. thus, tlr <dig> receptors are a specific local target for bladder pain.
