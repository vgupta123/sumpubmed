BACKGROUND
influenza a virus  is a major public health concern, ﻿being ﻿responsible for the death of approximately half a million people each year. zoonotic transmissions of the virus from swine and avian origin have occurred in the past, and can potentially lead to the em﻿gergence of new iav stains﻿ in fut﻿ure pandemics. pulmonary macrophages have been implicated in disease severity in the lower airway, and understanding the host response ﻿of macrophages infected with avian influenza viruses should provide new therapeutic strategies.


RESULTS
we used a systems-based approach to investigate the transcriptome response of primary murine lung macrophages  infected with the mouse-adapted h1n1/wsn virus and low pathogenic avian influenza  viruses h5n <dig> and h5n <dig>  the results showed that the lpai viruses h5n <dig> and h5n <dig> can infect pmФ with similar efficiency to the h1n1/wsn virus. while all viruses induced antiviral responses, the h5n <dig> virus infection resulted in higher expression levels of cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammatory responses.


CONCLUSIONS
the lpai h5n <dig> and h5n <dig> viruses are able to infect murine lung macrophages. however, the h5n <dig> virus was associated with increased expression of pro﻿-inflammatory mediators. a﻿lthough﻿ the h5n <dig> virus it is capable of inducing high levels of cytokines that are associated with inflammation﻿, this property is disti﻿nct from its inability to﻿ efficiently replicate in a mammalian host.
