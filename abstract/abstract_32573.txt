BACKGROUND
fatty acid type in beef can be detrimental to human health and has received considerable attention in recent years. the aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in longissimus thoracis muscle of  <dig> nellore young bulls with extreme phenotypes for fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat by rna-seq technique.


RESULTS
differential expression analyses between animals with extreme phenotype for fatty acid composition showed a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes for myristic ,  <dig> for palmitic ,  <dig> for stearic ,  <dig> for oleic ,  <dig> for conjugated linoleic ,  <dig> for linoleic , and  <dig> genes for α-linolenic  fatty acids. for the respective sums of the individual fatty acids,  <dig> differentially expressed genes for saturated fatty acids ,  <dig> for monounsaturated ,  <dig> for polyunsaturated ,  <dig> for pufa/sfa ratio,  <dig> for ω <dig>   <dig> for ω <dig>  and  <dig> for ω6/ω <dig> ratio were identified. functional annotation analyses identified several genes associated with fatty acid metabolism, such as those involved in intra and extra-cellular transport of fatty acid synthesis precursors in intramuscular fat of longissimus thoracis muscle. some of them must be highlighted, such as: acsm <dig> and acss <dig> genes, which work as a precursor in fatty acid synthesis; dgat <dig> gene that acts in the deposition of saturated fat in the adipose tissue; gpp and lpl genes that support the synthesis of insulin, stimulating both the glucose synthesis and the amino acids entry into the cells; and the bdh <dig> gene, which is responsible for the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies used in the synthesis of atp.


CONCLUSIONS
several genes related to lipid metabolism and fatty acid composition were identified. these findings must contribute to the elucidation of the genetic basis to improve nellore meat quality traits, with emphasis on human health. additionally, it can also contribute to improve the knowledge of fatty acid biosynthesis and the selection of animals with better nutritional quality.
