BACKGROUND
members of rhizopus species are the most common cause of mucormycosis, a rare but often fatal fungal infection. host induced pathogen apoptosis and pathogen induced host cell apoptosis are often involved in fungal infections. in many organisms, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c can trigger apoptosis by activating caspase proteases, but the role of fungal cytochrome c in apoptosis remains unknown.


RESULTS
dna sequence encoding rhizopus arrhizus cytochrome c was cloned and expressed in e. coli. both native and recombinant cytochrome c were purified using ion exchange followed by gel filtration chromatography. the identities of purified proteins were confirmed by maldi-ms and uv-visible spectroscopy. for the first time, we demonstrated that rhizopus arrhizus cytochrome c could activate human capspase- <dig> in hela cell extracts. we also found that rhizopus arrhizus cytochrome c has redox potential, peroxidase activity, and spectral properties similar to human and horse cytochrome c proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
rhizopus arrhizus cytochrome c can activate human caspase- <dig> in hela cell extracts and it possesses similar physical and spectral properties as human and horse cytochrome c. this protein was found to have a previously unknown potential to activate human caspase- <dig>  an important step in the apoptosis cascade.
