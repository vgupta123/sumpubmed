BACKGROUND
the early stages of ovarian follicle formation—beginning with the breakdown of germ cell cysts and continuing with the formation of primordial follicles and transition to primary and secondary follicles—are critical in determining reproductive life span and fertility. previously, we discovered that global knockouts of germ cell-specific transcriptional co-regulators sohlh <dig>  sohlh <dig>  lhx <dig>  and nobox, cause rapid oocyte loss and ovarian failure. also factors such as nobox and sohlh <dig> are associated with human premature ovarian failure. in this study, we developed a conditional knockout of lhx <dig> to study oocyte-specific pathways in postnatal folliculogenesis.


RESULTS
the conditional deficiency of lhx <dig> in the oocytes of primordial follicles leads to massive primordial oocyte activation, in part, by indirectly interacting with the pi3k-akt pathway, as shown by synergistic effects on foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation and rps <dig> activation. however, lhx <dig> does not directly regulate members of the pi3k-akt pathway; instead, we show that lhx <dig> represses lin28a expression, a known regulator of mammalian metabolism and of the akt/mtor pathway. lhx <dig> can bind to the lin28a promoter, and the depletion of lin28a in lhx8-deficient oocytes partially suppresses primordial oocyte activation. moreover, unlike the pi3k-akt pathway, lhx <dig> is critical beyond primordial follicle activation, and blocks the primary to secondary follicle transition.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the lhx8-lin28a pathway is essential in the earliest stages of primordial follicle activation, and lhx <dig> is an important oocyte-specific transcription factor in the ovary for regulating postnatal folliculogenesis.
