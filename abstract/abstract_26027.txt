BACKGROUND
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type  <dig>  post-transcriptionally degrades the low density lipoprotein receptors . however, it is unknown whether pcsk <dig> acts directly on the ldlr or if pcsk <dig> activates another protein that in turn causes degradation of the ldlr.


RESULTS
we have transiently transfected hepg <dig> cells with wild-type and mutant d374y-pcsk <dig> plasmids to study the effect of the conditioned medium on the ldlr of untransfected hepg <dig> cells. the ability of the conditioned medium to reduce the internalization of ldl was abolished by removal of recombinant pcsk <dig> from the conditioned medium by affinity chromatography. thus, pcsk <dig> is the only factor in the conditioned medium able to mediate degradation of the ldlr. moreover, fractionation of the conditioned medium by gel filtration showed that the ability of the fractions to reduce the internalization of ldl, closely paralleled the amount of d374y-pcsk <dig> in the fractions. incubation of a secreted, truncated ldlr without cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, as well as membrane fractions from hepg <dig> cells, with conditioned medium containing pcsk <dig>  did not reduce the amount of ldlr as determined by western blot analysis. thus, the ldlr is not degraded by pcsk <dig> on the cell surface. the ldlr of hepg <dig> cells incubated with conditioned medium was protected from pcsk9-mediated degradation by the addition of nocodazole or ammonium chloride, but was not protected when the conditioned medium was made hypertonic. these findings indicate that the intracellular degradation of the ldlr involves intracellular transport along microtubules, an acidic intracellular compartment and that it occurs even when endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits has been blocked.


CONCLUSIONS
degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig> is not mediated by a secreted protein acted upon by pcsk <dig> extracellularly. also the pcsk9-mediated degradation of the ldlr does not take place on the cell surface. rather, the pcsk9-mediated degradation of the ldlr appears to take place intracellularly and occurs even when endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits is blocked by hypertonic medium.
