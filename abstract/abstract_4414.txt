BACKGROUND
cortical neurons display network-level dynamics with unique spatiotemporal patterns that construct the backbone of processing information signals and contribute to higher functions. recent years have seen a wealth of research on the characteristics of neuronal networks that are sufficient conditions to activate or cease network functions. local field potentials  exhibit a scale-free and unique event size distribution  that has been proven in the cortex across species, including mice, rats, and humans, and may be used as an index of cortical excitability. in the present study, we induced seizure activity in the anterior cingulate cortex  with medial thalamic inputs and evaluated the impact of cortical excitability and thalamic inputs on network-level dynamics. we measured lfps from multi-electrode recordings in mouse cortical slices and isoflurane-anesthetized rats.


RESULTS
the acc activity exhibited a neuronal avalanche with regard to avalanche size distribution, and the slope of the power-law distribution of the neuronal avalanche reflected network excitability in vitro and in vivo. we found that the slope of the neuronal avalanche in seizure-like activity significantly correlated with cortical excitability induced by Î³-aminobutyric acid system manipulation. the thalamic inputs desynchronized cingulate seizures and affected the level of cortical excitability, the modulation of which could be determined by the slope of the avalanche size.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the neuronal avalanche may be a tool for analyzing cortical activity through lfps to determine alterations in network dynamics.
