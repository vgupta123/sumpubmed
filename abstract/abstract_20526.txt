BACKGROUND
scoliosis is the most common type of spinal deformity. in north american children, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis  makes up about 90% of all cases of scoliosis. while its prevalence is about 2% to 3% in children aged between  <dig> to  <dig> years, girls are more at risk than boys for severe progression with a ratio of  <dig>  to  <dig>  the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that idiopathic scoliosis interferes with the mechanisms responsible for sensory-reweighting during balance control.

methods
eight scoliosis patients  and nine healthy adolescents  participated in the experiment. visual and ankle proprioceptive information was perturbed  suddenly and then returned to normal . an amti force platform was used to compute centre of pressure root mean squared velocity and sway density curve.


RESULTS
for the control condition , adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients had a greater centre of pressure root mean squared velocity  than control participants. reintegration of ankle proprioception, when vision was either available or removed, led to an increased centre of pressure velocity variability for the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients whereas the control participants reduced their centre of pressure velocity variability. moreover, in the absence of vision, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis exhibited an increased centre of pressure velocity variability when ankle proprioception was returned to normal . the analysis of the sway density plot suggests that adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients, during sensory reintegration, do not scale appropriately their balance control commands.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, the present results demonstrate that idiopathic scoliosis adolescents have difficulty in reweighting sensory inputs following a brief period of sensory deprivation.
