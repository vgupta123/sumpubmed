BACKGROUND
recent research examining cross-platform correlation of gene expression intensities has yielded mixed results. in this study, we demonstrate use of a correction factor for estimating cross-platform correlations.


RESULTS
in this paper, three technical replicate microarrays were hybridized to each of three platforms. the three platforms were then analyzed to assess both intra- and cross-platform reproducibility. we present various methods for examining intra-platform reproducibility. we also examine cross-platform reproducibility using pearson's correlation. additionally, we previously developed a correction factor for pearson's correlation which is applicable when x and y are measured with error. herein we demonstrate that correcting for measurement error by estimating the "disattenuated" correlation substantially improves cross-platform correlations.


CONCLUSIONS
when estimating cross-platform correlation, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate intra-platform reproducibility as a first step. in addition, since measurement error is present in microarray gene expression data, methods to correct for attenuation are useful in decreasing the bias in cross-platform correlation estimates.
