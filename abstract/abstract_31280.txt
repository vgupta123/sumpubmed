BACKGROUND
cysteine is a component in organic compounds including glutathione that have been implicated in the adaptation of plants to stresses. o-acetylserine  lyase  catalyses the final step of cysteine biosynthesis. oas-tl enzyme isoforms are localised in the cytoplasm, the plastids and mitochondria but the contribution of individual oas-tl isoforms to plant sulphur metabolism has not yet been fully clarified.


RESULTS
the seedling lethal phenotype of the arabidopsis onset of leaf death3- <dig>  mutant is due to a point mutation in the oas-a <dig> gene, encoding the cytosolic oas-tl. the mutation causes a single amino acid substitution from gly <dig> to glu <dig>  abolishing old3- <dig> oas-tl activity in vitro. the old3- <dig> mutation segregates as a monogenic semi-dominant trait when backcrossed to its wild type accession landsberg erecta  and the di- <dig> accession. consistent with its semi-dominant behaviour, wild type ler- <dig> plants transformed with the mutated old3- <dig> gene, displayed the early leaf death phenotype. however, the old3- <dig> mutation segregates in an 11:4: <dig>  ratio when backcrossed to the colombia- <dig> and wassilewskija accessions. thus, the early leaf death phenotype depends on two semi-dominant loci. the second locus that determines the old3- <dig> early leaf death phenotype is referred to as odd-ler  and is located on chromosome  <dig>  the early leaf death phenotype is temperature dependent and is associated with increased expression of defence-response and oxidative-stress marker genes. independent of the presence of the odd-ler gene, oas-a <dig> is involved in maintaining sulphur and thiol levels and is required for resistance against cadmium stress.


CONCLUSIONS
the cytosolic oas-tl is involved in maintaining organic sulphur levels. the old3- <dig> mutation causes genome-dependent and independent phenotypes and uncovers a novel function for the mutated oas-tl in cell death regulation.
