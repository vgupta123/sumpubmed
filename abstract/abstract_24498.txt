BACKGROUND
cortical neurons display dynamic patterns of gene expression during the coincident processes of differentiation and migration through the developing cerebrum. to identify genes selectively expressed by the eomes +  lineage of excitatory cortical neurons, gfp-expressing cells from tg gsat embryos were isolated to > 99% purity and profiled.


RESULTS
we report the identification, validation and spatial grouping of genes selectively expressed within the eomes + cortical excitatory neuron lineage during early cortical development. in these neurons  <dig> genes were expressed ≥ 3-fold, and  <dig> genes ≤ 3-fold, compared to the reference population of neuronal precursors. of the up-regulated genes,  <dig> were represented at the genepaint in situ hybridization database and  <dig>  were validated as having spatial expression patterns consistent with the lineage of differentiating excitatory neurons. a novel approach for quantifying in situ hybridization patterns  across the cerebral wall was developed that allowed the hierarchical clustering of genes into putative co-regulated groups. forty four candidate genes were identified that show spatial expression with intermediate precursor cells,  <dig> candidate genes show spatial expression with multipolar neurons, while the remaining  <dig> genes achieved peak expression in the developing cortical plate.


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis of differentiating excitatory neurons revealed the expression patterns of  <dig> transcription factors, many chemotropic signaling molecules , and unexpected evidence for non-canonical neurotransmitter signaling and changes in mechanisms of glucose metabolism. over half of the  <dig> identified genes are associated with neuronal disease making these findings a valuable resource for studies of neurological development and disease.
