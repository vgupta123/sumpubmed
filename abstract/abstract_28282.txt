BACKGROUND
anaplasma phagocytophilum is a gram-negative bacterium that replicates obligate intracellularly in neutrophils. it is transmitted by ixodes spp. ticks and causes acute febrile disease in humans, dogs, horses, cats, and livestock. because a. phagocytophilum is not transmitted transovarially in ixodes spp., it is thought to depend on reservoir hosts to complete its life cycle. in europe, a. phagocytophilum was detected in roe deer, red deer, wild boars, and small mammals. in contrast to roe deer, red deer and wild boars have been considered as reservoir hosts for granulocytic anaplasmosis in humans, dogs, and horses according to groesl- and anka-based genotyping. a. phagocytophilum variants infecting small mammals in europe have not been characterized extensively to date.


RESULTS
we amplified the total anka open reading frames of  <dig> strains from voles and shrews. the analysis revealed that they harboured a. phagocytophilum strains that belonged to a distinct newly described anka gene cluster. further, we provide evidence that the heterogeneity of anka gene sequences might have arisen via recombination.


CONCLUSIONS
based on anka-based genotyping voles and shrews are unlikely reservoir hosts for granulocytic anaplasmosis in humans, dogs, horses, and livestock in europe.
