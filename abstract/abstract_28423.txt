BACKGROUND
stanniocalcins  represent small glycoprotein hormones, found in all vertebrates, which have been functionally implicated in calcium homeostasis. however, recent data from mammalian systems indicated that they may be also involved in embryogenesis, tumorigenesis and in the context of the latter especially in angiogenesis. human stc <dig> is a  <dig> amino acids protein with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig> kda, but preliminary data suggested its di- or multimerization. the latter in conjunction with alternative splicing and/or post-translational modification gives rise to forms described as stc <dig> and "big stc", which molecular weights range from  <dig> to  <dig> kda.


RESULTS
in this study we performed a biochemical and structural analysis of stc <dig> with the aim of obtaining low resolution structural information about the human stc <dig>  since structural information in this protein family is scarce. we expressed stc <dig> in both e. coli and insect cells using the baculo virus system with a c-terminal  <dig> Ã— his fusion tag. from the latter we obtained reasonable amounts of soluble protein. circular dichroism analysis showed stc <dig> as a well structured protein with 52% of alpha-helical content. mass spectroscopy analysis of the recombinant protein allowed to assign the five intramolecular disulfide bridges as well as the dimerization cys <dig>  thereby confirming the conservation of the disulfide pattern previously described for fish stc <dig>  saxs data also clearly demonstrated that stc <dig> adopts a dimeric, slightly elongated structure in solution.


CONCLUSIONS
our data reveal the first low resolution, structural information for human stc <dig>  theoretical predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy both suggested that stc <dig> has a high content of alpha-helices and saxs experiments revealed that stc <dig> is a dimer of slightly elongated shape in solution. the dimerization was confirmed by mass spectrometry as was the highly conserved disulfide pattern, which is identical to that found in fish stc <dig>
