BACKGROUND
to elucidate the molecular complications in many complex diseases, we argue for the priority to construct a model representing the normal physiological state of a cell/tissue.


RESULTS
by analyzing three independent microarray datasets on normal human tissues, we established a quantitative molecular model get, which consists of  <dig> tissue-specific gene expression templates constructed from a set of  <dig> genes, for predicting  <dig> distinct tissue types under disease-free condition.  <dig> % correctness was reached when a large-scale validation was performed on  <dig> new datasets to test the tissue-prediction power of get. network analysis based on molecular interactions suggests a potential role of these  <dig> genes in tissue differentiation and carcinogenesis.

applying get to transcriptomic datasets produced from tissue development studies the results correlated well with developmental stages. cancerous tissues and cell lines yielded significantly lower correlation with get than the normal tissues. get distinguished melanoma from normal skin tissue or benign skin tumor with 96% sensitivity and 89% specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results strongly suggest that a normal tissue or cell may uphold its normal functioning and morphology by maintaining specific chemical stoichiometry among genes. the state of stoichiometry can be depicted by a compact set of representative genes such as the  <dig> genes obtained here. a significant deviation from normal stoichiometry may result in malfunction or abnormal growth of the cells.
