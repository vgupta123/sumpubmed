BACKGROUND
long-term potentiation  and long-term depression  play important roles in mediating activity-dependent changes in synaptic transmission and are believed to be crucial mechanisms underlying learning and cortical plasticity. in human subjects, however, the lack of adequate input stimuli for the induction of ltp and ltd makes it difficult to study directly the impact of such protocols on behavior.


RESULTS
using tactile high- and low-frequency stimulation protocols in humans, we explored the potential of such protocols for the induction of perceptual changes. we delivered tactile high-frequency and low-frequency stimuli  to skin sites of approximately  <dig> mm <dig> on the tip of the index finger. as assessed by 2-point discrimination, we demonstrate that  <dig> minutes of t-hfs improved tactile discrimination, while t-lfs impaired performance. t-hfs-effects were stable for at least  <dig> hours whereas t-lfs-induced changes recovered faster. while t-hfs changes were spatially very specific with no changes on the neighboring fingers, impaired tactile performance after t-lfs was also observed on the right middle-finger. a central finding was that for both t-lfs and t-hfs perceptual changes were dependent on the size of the stimulated skin area. no changes were observed when the stimulated area was very small  indicating special requirements for spatial summation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate differential effects of such protocols in a frequency specific manner that might be related to ltp- and ltd-like changes in human subjects.
