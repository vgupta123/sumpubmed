BACKGROUND
proteomic analysis has proven to be the most powerful method for describing plant species and lines, and for identification of proteins in complex mixtures. the strength of this method resides in high resolving power of two-dimensional electrophoresis , coupled with highly sensitive mass spectrometry , and sequence homology search. by using this method, we might find polymorphic markers to differentiate peanut subspecies.


RESULTS
total proteins extracted from seeds of  <dig> different genotypes of cultivated peanut , comprised of runner market  and spanish-bunch market type , were separated by electrophoresis on both one- and two-dimensional sds-page gels. the protein profiles were similar on one-dimensional gels for all tested peanut genotypes. however, peanut genotype a <dig> lacked one major band with a molecular weight of about  <dig> kda. there was one minor band with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda that was present in all runner peanut genotypes and the spanish-derivatives . the spanish-derivatives have a runner-type peanut in their pedigrees. the  <dig> kda protein in a <dig> and the  <dig> kda protein in runner-type peanut genotypes were confirmed on the 2-d sds-page gels. among more than  <dig> main protein spots on the 2-d gels, four protein spots that were individually marked as spots 1â€“ <dig> showed polymorphic patterns between runner-type and spanish-bunch peanuts. spot  <dig>  and spot  <dig>  were observed in all spanish-bunch genotypes, but were not found in runner types. in contrast, spot  <dig>  and spot  <dig>  were present in all runner peanut genotypes but not in spanish-bunch genotypes. these four protein spots were sequenced. based on the internal and n-terminal amino acid sequences, these proteins are isoforms  of each other, are iso-allergens and may be modified by post-translational cleavage.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that there may be an association between these polymorphic storage protein isoforms and peanut subspecies fastigiata  and hypogaea . the polymorphic protein peptides distinguished by 2-d page could be used as markers for identification of runner and spanish peanuts.
