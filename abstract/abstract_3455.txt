BACKGROUND
mir <dig> and mir <dig> are both involved in conserved phosphorus  deficiency signalling pathways. mir <dig> targets the pho <dig> gene encoding e <dig> enzyme that negatively regulates phosphate uptake and root-to-shoot allocation, while mir <dig> targets spx-domain-containing genes that negatively regulate other p-responsive genes. however, the response of mir <dig> and mir <dig> to p conditions in barley has not been investigated.


RESULTS
in this study, we investigated the expression profiles of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in barley  under p-deficient and p-sufficient conditions. we identified  <dig> members of the mir <dig> family and one mir <dig> gene in barley, all of which were significantly up-regulated under deficient p. in addition, we found many isomirs of the mir <dig> family and mir <dig>  most of which were also significantly up-regulated under deficient p. several isomirs of mir <dig> members were found to be able to cleave their predicted targets in vivo. surprisingly, a few small rnas  derived from the single-stranded loops of the hairpin structures of mir399b and mir399e- <dig> were also found to be able to cleave their predicted targets in vivo. many antisense srnas of mir <dig> and a few for mir <dig> were also detected, but they did not seem to be regulated by p. intriguingly, the lowest expressed member, hvu-mir399k, had four-fold more antisense srnas than sense srnas, and furthermore under p sufficiency, the antisense srnas are more frequent than the sense srnas. we identified a potential regulatory network among mir <dig>  its target hvpho <dig> and target mimics hvips <dig> and hvips <dig> in barley under p-deficient and p-sufficient conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide an important insight into the mechanistic regulation and function of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and their isomirs in barley under different p conditions.
