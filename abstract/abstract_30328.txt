BACKGROUND
triptolide is a diterpene triepoxide from the chinese medicinal plant tripterygium wilfordii hook f., with known anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-cancer properties.


RESULTS
here we report the expression profile of immune signaling genes modulated by triptolide in lps induced mouse macrophages. in an array study triptolide treatment modulated expression of  <dig> % of one hundred and ninety five immune signaling genes that included toll-like receptors . tlrs elicit immune responses through their coupling with intracellular adaptor molecules, myd <dig> and trif. although it is known that triptolide inhibits nfκb activation and other signaling pathways downstream of tlrs, involvement of tlr cascade in triptolide activity was not reported. in this study, we show that triptolide suppresses expression of proinflammatory downstream effectors induced specifically by different tlr agonists. also, the suppressive effect of triptolide on tlr-induced nfκb activation was observed when either myd <dig> or trif was knocked out, confirming that both myd <dig> and trif mediated nfκb activation may be inhibited by triptolide. within the tlr cascade triptolide downregulates tlr <dig> and trif proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals involvement of tlr signaling in triptolide activity and further increases understanding of how triptolide activity may downregulate nfκb activation during inflammatory conditions.
