BACKGROUND
growth hormone-releasing hormone  plasmid-based therapy for the treatment of chronic renal failure and its complications was examined. companion dogs  and cats  received a single  <dig>  mg or  <dig>  mg species-specific plasmid injection, respectively, intramuscularly followed by electroporation, and analyzed up to  <dig> days post-treatment; controls underwent electroporation without plasmid administration.


RESULTS
plasmid-treated animals showed an increase in body weight  compared to control animals, and displayed improved quality of life parameters including significant increases in appetite, activity, mentation and exercise tolerance levels. insulin-like growth factor i  levels were increased in the plasmid treated animals. hematological parameters were also significantly improved. protein metabolism changes were observed suggesting a shift from a catabolic to an anabolic state in the treated animals. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine did not show any significant changes suggesting maintenance of kidney function whereas the control animal's renal function deteriorated. treated animals survived longer than control animals with 70% of dogs and 80% of cats surviving until study day  <dig>  only 17% and 40% of the control dogs and cats, respectively, survived to day  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
improved quality of life, survival and general well-being indicate that further investigation is warranted, and show the potential of a plasmid-based therapy by electroporation in preventing and managing complications of renal insufficiency.
