BACKGROUND
in vitro studies have shown that the active form of vitamin d <dig>  1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> 2d3), can regulate differentiation of cd4+ t cells by inhibiting th <dig> and th <dig> cell differentiation and promoting th <dig> and treg cell differentiation. however, the serum concentration of  <dig> d <dig> is far below the effective concentration of  <dig> d <dig> found in in vitro studies, and it has been suggested that  <dig> d <dig> must be produced locally from the inactive precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin d <dig> d3) to affect ongoing immune responses in vivo. although it has been reported that activated t cells express the 25d-1α-hydroxylase cyp27b <dig> that converts 25d <dig> to  <dig> d <dig>  it is still controversial whether activated t cells have the capacity to produce sufficient amounts of  <dig> d <dig> to affect vitamin d-responsive genes. furthermore, it is not known how the vitamin d-binding protein  found in high concentrations in serum affects t cell responses to 25d <dig> 


RESULTS
we found that activated t cells express cyp27b <dig> and have the capacity to produce sufficient  <dig> d <dig> to affect vitamin d-responsive genes when cultured with physiological concentrations of 25d <dig> in serum-free medium. however, if the medium was supplemented with serum or purified dbp, dbp strictly inhibited the production of  <dig> d <dig> and 25d3-induced t cell responses. in contrast, dbp did not inhibit the effect of exogenous  <dig> d <dig>  actin, arachidonic acid and albumin did not affect the sequestration of 25d <dig> by dbp, whereas carbonylation of dbp did.


CONCLUSIONS
activated t cells express cyp27b <dig> and can convert 25d <dig> to  <dig> d <dig> in sufficiently high concentrations to affect vitamin d-responsive genes when cultured in serum-free medium. however, dbp sequesters 25d <dig> and inhibits the production of  <dig> d <dig> in t cells. to fully exploit the immune-regulatory potential of vitamin d, future studies of the mechanisms that enable the immune system to exploit 25d <dig> and convert it to  <dig> d3in vivo are required.
