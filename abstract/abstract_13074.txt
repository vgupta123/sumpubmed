BACKGROUND
cell adhesion, an integral part of d. discoideum development, is important for morphogenesis and regulated gene expression in the multicellular context and is required to trigger cell-differentiation. g-protein linked adenylyl cyclase pathways are crucially involved and a mutant lacking the aggregation specific adenylyl cyclase aca does not undergo multicellular development.


RESULTS
here, we have investigated the role of cyclase-associated protein , an important regulator of cell polarity and f-actin/g-actin ratio in the aca- mutant. we show that ectopic expression of gfp-cap improves cell polarization, streaming and aggregation in aca- cells, but it fails to completely restore development. our studies indicate a requirement of cap in the aca dependent signal transduction for progression of the development of unicellular amoebae into multicellular structures. the reduced expression of the cell adhesion molecule ddcad <dig> together with csa is responsible for the defects in aca- cells to initiate multicellular development. early development was restored by the expression of gfp-cap that enhanced the ddcad <dig> transcript levels and to a lesser extent the csa mrna levels.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our data shows a novel role of cap in regulating cell adhesion mechanisms during development that might be envisioned to unravel the functions of mammalian cap during animal embryogenesis.
