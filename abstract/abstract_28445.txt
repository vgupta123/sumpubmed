BACKGROUND
the breakpoint median for a set of k â‰¥  <dig> random genomes tends to approach  one of these genomes  as genome length increases, although there are diminishing proportion of medians equidistant from all k . algorithms are likely to miss the latter, and this has consequences for the general case where input genomes share some or many gene adjacencies, where the tendency for the median to be closer to one input genome may be an artifact of the corner tendency.


RESULTS
we present a simple sampling procedure for constructing a "near median" that represents a compromise among k random genomes and that has only a slightly greater breakpoint distance to all of them than the median does. we generalize to the realistic case where genomes share varying proportions of gene adjacencies. we present a supplementary sampling scheme that brings the constructed genome even closer to median status.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach is of particular use in the phylogenetic context where medians are repeatedly calculated at ancestral nodes, and where the corner effect prevents different parts of the phylogeny from communicating with each other.
