BACKGROUND
tomato leaf mold is a common disease in tomato cultivation. this disease is caused by cladosporium fulvum, which has many physiological races and differentiates rapidly. cf genes confer resistance to c. fulvum, and the c. fulvum-tomato pathosystem is a model for the study of gene-for-gene interactions. plants carrying the cf- <dig> gene show effective resistance to c. fulvum in the field, and can be used in breeding and resistance mechanism studies as new resistant materials. in this study, we used f <dig> bulk specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing  and parental resequencing methods to locate and characterize the cf- <dig> gene.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> diff_markers and three association regions were found in association analysis. a  <dig> -mb region containing seven cf-type genes was identified in further analysis based on data from slaf-seq and parental resequencing. two candidate genes, solyc01g <dig> . <dig> and solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  were screened out by quantitative real-time pcr  analysis. sequence analysis showed that solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  in cgn <dig> was a novel homologue of the cladosporium resistance gene cf- <dig>  in the cf-4/ <dig> locus. the marker p <dig>  which cosegregated with the resistant trait, was developed based on sequence mutation of the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus in cgn <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the cf- <dig> gene was mapped to the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  the candidate genes solyc01g <dig> . <dig> and solyc01g <dig> . <dig> showed related amino acid sequence structures and expression patterns. solyc01g <dig> . <dig> had a close evolutionary relationship with the functional hcr <dig> members cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  and was very different from non-functional members. the results from this study will facilitate the breeding of cultivars carrying the cf- <dig> gene and provide a basis for further gene cloning, resistance gene evolution and plant resistance mechanism studies.
