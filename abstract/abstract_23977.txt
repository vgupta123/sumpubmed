BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is a major health problem and hiv is the major cause of the increase in tb. sub-saharan africa is endemic for both tb and hiv infection. determination of the prevalence of m. tuberculosis strains and their drug susceptibility is important for tb control.

tb positive culture, bal fluid or sputum samples from  <dig> patients were collected and genotyped. the spoligotypes were correlated with anti-tuberculous drug susceptibility in hiv-infected and non-hiv patients from tanzania.


RESULTS
one-third of patients were tb/hiv co-infected. forty-seven spoligotypes were identified.

fourteen isolates  had new and unique spoligotypes while  <dig> isolates  belonged to  <dig> known spoligotypes. the major spoligotypes contained nine clusters: cas1-kili  <dig> %, lam11- zwe  <dig> %, nd  <dig> %, eai  <dig> %, beijing  <dig> %, t-undefined  <dig> %, cas1-delhi  <dig> %, t <dig>  <dig> % and lam <dig>  <dig> %. twelve  of the  <dig> phenotypically tested strains were resistant to anti-tb drugs. eight  were monoresistant strains:  <dig> to isoniazid  and one to streptomycin. four strains  were resistant to multiple drugs: one  was resistant to inh and streptomycin and the other three  were mdr strains: one was resistant to inh, rifampicin and ethambutol and two were resistant to all four anti-tb drugs. mutation in the katg gene codon  <dig> and the rpob hotspot region showed a low and high sensitivity, respectively, as predictor of phenotypic drug resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
cas1-kili and lam11-zwe were the most common families. strains of the beijing family and cas1-kili were not or least often associated with resistance, respectively. hiv status was not associated with spoligotypes, resistance or previous tb treatment.
