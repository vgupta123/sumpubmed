BACKGROUND
non-biological signal  has been the bane of microarray analysis. hybridization effects related to probe-sequence composition and dna dye-probe interactions have been observed in differential methylation hybridization  microarray experiments as well as other effects inherent to the dmh protocol.


RESULTS
we suggest two models to correct for non-biologically relevant probe signal with an overarching focus on probe-sequence composition. the estimated effects are evaluated and the strengths of the models are considered in the context of dmh analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
the majority of estimated parameters were statistically significant in all considered models. model selection for signal correction is based on interpretation of the estimated values and their biological significance.
