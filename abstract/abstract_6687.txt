BACKGROUND
alg- <dig>  belongs to the penta-ef-hand  protein family and ca2+-dependently interacts with various intracellular proteins including mammalian alix, an adaptor protein in the escrt system. our previous x-ray crystal structural analyses revealed that binding of ca2+ to ef <dig> enables the side chain of r <dig> to move enough to make a primary hydrophobic pocket  accessible to a short fragment of alix. the side chain of f <dig>  facing a secondary hydrophobic pocket , interacts with the alix peptide. an alternatively spliced shorter isoform, designated alg-2Δgf <dig>  lacks gly121phe <dig> and does not bind alix, but the structural basis of the incompetence has remained to be elucidated.


RESULTS
we solved the x-ray crystal structure of the pef domain of alg-2Δgf <dig> in the ca2+-bound form and compared it with that of alg- <dig>  deletion of the two residues shortened α-helix  <dig>  and changed the configuration of the r <dig> side chain so that it partially blocked pocket  <dig>  a wall created by the main chain of 121-gfg- <dig> and facing the two pockets was destroyed. surprisingly, however, substitution of f <dig> with ala or gly, but not with trp, increased the alix-binding capacity in binding assays. the f <dig> substitutions exhibited different effects on binding of alg- <dig> to other known interacting proteins, including tsg <dig>  and annexin a <dig>  the x-ray crystal structure of the f122a mutant revealed that removal of the bulky f <dig> side chain not only created an additional open space in pocket  <dig> but also abolished inter-helix interactions with w <dig> and v <dig>  and that α <dig> inclined away from α <dig> to expand pocket  <dig>  suggesting acquirement of more appropriate positioning of the interacting residues to accept alix.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that the inability of the two-residue shorter alg- <dig> isoform to bind alix is not due to the absence of bulky side chain of f <dig> but due to deformation of a main-chain wall facing pockets  <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, a residue at the position of f <dig> contributes to target specificity and a smaller side chain is preferable for alix binding but not favored to bind annexin a <dig>
