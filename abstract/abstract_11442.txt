BACKGROUND
in drosophila melanogaster the enhancer of split-complex  consists of seven highly related genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix  repressors and intermingled, four genes that belong to the bearded  family. both gene classes are targets of the notch signalling pathway. the achaete-scute-complex  comprises four genes encoding bhlh activators. the question arose how these complexes evolved with regard to gene number in the evolution of insects concentrating on diptera and the hymenoptera apis mellifera.


RESULTS
in drosophilids both gene complexes are highly conserved, spanning roughly  <dig> million years of evolution. however, in species more diverged like anopheles or apis we find dramatic differences. here, the e-c consists of one bhlh  and one brd family member  in a head to head arrangement. interestingly in apis but not in anopheles, there are two more e bhlh like genes within  <dig> kb, which may reflect duplication events in the honeybee that occurred independently of that in diptera. the as-c may have arisen from a single sc/l'sc like gene which is well conserved in apis and anopheles and a second ase like gene that is highly diverged, however, located within  <dig> kb.


CONCLUSIONS
e-c and as-c presumably evolved by gene duplication to the nowadays complex composition in drosophilids in order to govern the accurate expression patterns typical for these highly evolved insects. the ancestral ur-complexes, however, consisted most likely of just two genes: e-c contains one bhlh member of mβ type and one brd family member of mα type and as-c contains one sc/l'sc and a highly diverged ase like gene.
