BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is the main cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea. in the past decade, the number of c. difficile patients has increased dramatically, coinciding with the emergence of two pcr ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  pcr ribotype  <dig> is also frequently found during c. difficile outbreaks in pigfarms. previously, the genome of the pcr ribotype  <dig> strain m <dig>  a human isolate, was described to contain a unique insert of  <dig> kilobases.


RESULTS
analysis of this insert revealed over  <dig> open reading frames, encoding proteins originating from transposons, phages and plasmids. the insert was shown to be a transposon , as evidenced by the presence of an excised and circularised molecule, containing the ligated 5’and 3’ends of the insert. transfer of the element could not be shown through filter-mating experiments. whole genome sequencing of pcr ribotype  <dig> strain  <dig>  isolated from a diarrheic piglet, showed that tn <dig> was not present in this strain. to test the prevalence of tn <dig>  a collection of  <dig> clostridium difficile pcr ribotype  <dig> isolates from human  and porcine  origin was tested for the presence of this element by pcr. the transposon was present in  <dig> human, tetracycline resistant isolates, originating from various countries in europe, and none of the pig strains. nine other strains, also tetracycline resistant human isolates, contained half of the transposon, suggesting multiple insertion steps yielding the full tn <dig>  other pcr ribotypes  were all negative for the presence of the transposon. multi locus variable tandem repeat analysis revealed genetic relatedness among transposon containing isolates. although the element contained several potential antibiotic resistance genes, it did not yield a readily distinguishable phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
tn <dig> is a newly described transposon, occurring sporadically in c. difficile pcr ribotype  <dig> strains. although no transfer of the element could be shown, we hypothesize that the element could serve as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes for other bacteria. further research is needed to investigate the transfer capabilities of the element and to substantiate the possible role of tn <dig> as a source of antibiotic resistance genes for other gut pathogens.
