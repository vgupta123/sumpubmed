BACKGROUND
oil palm is the world's most productive oil-food crop despite yielding well below its theoretical maximum. this maximum could be approached with the introduction of elite f <dig> varieties. the development of such elite lines has thus far been prevented by difficulties in generating homozygous parental types for f <dig> generation.


RESULTS
here we present the first high-throughput screen to identify spontaneously-formed haploid  and doubled haploid  palms. we secured over  <dig>  hs and one dh from genetically diverse material and derived further dh/mixoploid palms from hs using colchicine. we demonstrated viability of pollen from h plants and expect to generate 100% homogeneous f <dig> seed from intercrosses between dh/mixoploids once they develop female inflorescences.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has generated genetically diverse h/dh palms from which parental clones can be selected in sufficient numbers to enable the commercial-scale breeding of f <dig> varieties. the anticipated step increase in productivity may help to relieve pressure to extend palm cultivation, and limit further expansion into biodiverse rainforest.
