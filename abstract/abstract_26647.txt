BACKGROUND
muscleblind-like  <dig>  is an alternative splicing factor containing four ccch zinc fingers . the sequestration of mbnl <dig> by expanded cug and ccug repeats is a major component in causing myotonic dystrophy. in addition to binding the structured expanded cug and ccug repeats; previous results suggested that mbnl <dig> binds single-stranded rnas containing gc dinucleotides.


RESULTS
we performed a systematic analysis of mbnl <dig> binding to single-stranded rnas. these studies revealed that a single gc dinucleotide in poly-uridine is sufficient for mbnl <dig> binding and that a second gc dinucleotide confers higher affinity mbnl <dig> binding. however additional gc dinucleotides do not enhance rna binding. we also showed that the rna sequences adjacent to the gc dinucleotides play an important role in mbnl <dig> binding with the following preference: uridines >cytidines >adenosines >guanosines. for high affinity binding by mbnl <dig>  the distance between the two gc dinucleotides can vary from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that mbnl <dig> is highly flexible and able to adopt different conformations to recognize rnas with varying sequence configurations. although mbnl <dig> contains four znfs, only two znf - gc dinucleotide interactions are necessary for high affinity binding.
