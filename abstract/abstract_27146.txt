BACKGROUND
nerve growth factor  is a potent growth factor that plays a key role in neuronal cell differentiation and may also play a role in hematopoietic differentiation. it has been shown that ngf induced synergistic action for the colony formation of cd <dig> positive hematopoietic progenitor cells treated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor , or stem cell factor . however, the exact role of ngf in hematopoietic system is unclear. it is also not clear whether ngf mediated signals in hematopoietic cells are identical to those in neuronal cells.


RESULTS
to study the signal transduction pathways induced by ngf treatment in hematopoietic cells, we utilized the mastocytoma cell line hmc- <dig> which expresses the ngf receptor, tropomyosin-receptor-kinase a, as well as the constitutively activated scf receptor, v560g c-kit, which can be inhibited completely by treatment with the potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate . ngf rescues hmc- <dig> cells from imatinib mediated cell death and promotes proliferation. to examine the ngf mediated proliferation and survival in these cells, we compared the ngf mediated upregulated genes  to the downregulated genes by imatinib treatment  by transcriptome analysis. the following conclusions can be drawn from the microarray data: firstly, gene expression profiling reveals 50% overlap of genes induced by ngf-trka with genes expressed downstream of v560g c-kit. secondly, ngf treatment does not enhance expression of genes involved in immune related functions that were down regulated by imatinib treatment. thirdly, more than 55% of common upregulated genes are involved in cell proliferation and survival. fourthly, we found kruppel-like factor   <dig> and smad family member  <dig>  as the ngf mediated novel downstream genes in hematopoietic cells. finally, the downregulation of klf <dig> gene enhanced imatinib induced apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
ngf does not induce genes which are involved in immune related functions, but induces proliferation and survival signals in hmc- <dig> cells. furthermore, the current data provide novel candidate genes, klf <dig> and smad <dig> which are induced by ngf/trka activation in hematopoietic cells. since the depletion of klf <dig> causes enhanced apoptosis of hmc- <dig>  klf <dig> may play a role in the ngf mediated survival signal.
