BACKGROUND
sumo  conjugation is a post translational regulatory process found in all eukaryotes, mediated by sumo activating enzyme, sumo conjugating enzyme, and sumo ligase for the attachment of sumo to its target protein. although the mechanism for regulation of sumo conjugation pathway genes under abiotic stress has been studied to certain extent, the role of sumo conjugating enzyme in improving abiotic stress tolerance to plant is largely unexplored. here, we have characterized a sumo conjugating enzyme gene ‘sasce9’ from a halophytic grass spartina alterniflora and investigated its role in imparting abiotic stress tolerance.


RESULTS
sasce <dig> gene encodes for a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of ~ <dig> kd and isoelectric point  <dig> . amino acid sequence comparisons of sasce <dig> with its orthologs from other plant species showed high degree  of structural conservation among each other. complementation analysis using yeast sce mutant, ubc <dig>  revealed functional conservation of sasce <dig> between yeast and s. alterniflora. sasce <dig> transcript was inducible by salinity, drought, cold, and exogenously supplied aba both in leaves and roots of s. alterniflora. constitutive overexpression of sasce <dig> in arabidopsis through agrobacterium mediated transformation improved salinity and drought tolerance of arabidopsis. sasce <dig> overexpressing arabidopsis plants retained more chlorophyll and proline both under salinity and drought stress. sasce <dig> transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of reactive oxygen under salinity stress. expression analysis of stress responsive genes in sasce <dig> arabidopsis plants revealed the increased expression of antioxidant genes, atsod and atcat, ion antiporter genes, atnhx <dig> and atsos <dig>  a gene involved in proline biosynthesis, atp5cs, and a gene involved in aba dependent signaling pathway, atrd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlight the prospect of improving abiotic stress tolerance in plants through genetic engineering of the sumoylation pathway. the study provides evidence that the overexpression of sasce <dig> in plant can improve salinity and drought stress tolerance by protecting the plant through scavenging of ros, accumulation of an osmolyte, proline, and expression of stress responsive genes. in addition, this study demonstrates the potential of the halophyte grass s. alterniflora as a reservoir of abiotic stress related genes for crop improvement.
