BACKGROUND
matriptase is a membrane serine protease essential for epithelial development, homeostasis, and regeneration, as well as a central orchestrator of pathogenic pericellular signaling in the context of inflammatory and proliferative diseases. matriptase is an unusual protease in that its zymogen displays measurable enzymatic activity.


RESULTS
here, we used gain and loss of function genetics to investigate the possible biological functions of zymogen matriptase. unexpectedly, transgenic mice mis-expressing a zymogen-locked version of matriptase in the epidermis displayed pathologies previously reported for transgenic mice mis-expressing wildtype epidermal matriptase. equally surprising, mice engineered to express only zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase, unlike matriptase null mice, were viable, developed epithelial barrier function, and regenerated the injured epithelium. compatible with these observations, wildtype and zymogen-locked matriptase were equipotent activators of par- <dig> inflammatory signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
the study demonstrates that the matriptase zymogen is biologically active and is capable of executing developmental and homeostatic functions of the protease.
