BACKGROUND
spt <dig> is an integral component of the multi-subunit saga complex that is required for the expression of ~10% of yeast genes. two forms of spt <dig> have been identified, the second of which is truncated at its c-terminus and found in the saga-like  complex.


RESULTS
we have found that c-terminal processing of spt <dig> to its slik form  and to a distinct third form  occurs in the absence of the saga complex components gcn <dig>  spt <dig>  ada <dig> and spt <dig>  the latter two of which are required for the integrity of the complex. in addition, n-terminally truncated derivatives of spt <dig>  including a derivative lacking the histone fold, are processed, indicating that the c-terminus of spt <dig> is sufficient for processing and that processing does not require functional spt <dig>  using galactose inducible spt <dig> expression, we show that the three forms of spt <dig> appear and disappear at approximately the same rate with full-length spt <dig> not being chased into spt7slik or spt7form <dig>  interestingly, reduced levels of spt7slik and spt7form <dig> were observed in a strain lacking the saga component ubp <dig>  suggesting a regulatory role for ubp <dig> in the truncation of spt <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that truncation of spt <dig> occurs early in the biosynthesis of distinct spt <dig> containing complexes rather than being a dynamic process linked to the action of the saga complex in transcriptional regulation.
