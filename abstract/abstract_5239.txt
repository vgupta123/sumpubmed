BACKGROUND
the st <dig> lineage is a globally disseminated, multiply drug-resistant hospital-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus . we performed whole-genome sequencing of representative ha-mrsa isolates of the st <dig> lineage from bacteremic patients in hospitals in hong kong  and beijing  and compared them with three published complete genomes of st <dig>  namely t <dig>  tw <dig> and jkd <dig>  orthologous gene group  analyses of the hong kong and beijing cluster strains were also undertaken.


RESULTS
homology analysis, based on highest-percentage nucleotide identity, indicated that hk isolates were closely related to tw <dig>  whereas bj isolates were more closely related to t <dig> from tianjin. phylogenetic analysis, incorporating a total of  <dig> isolates from different continents, revealed that strains from hk clustered with tw <dig> into the ‘asian clade’, whereas bj isolates and t <dig> clustered closely with strains of the ‘turkish clade’ from eastern europe. hk isolates contained the typical φspβ-like prophage with the sasx gene similar to tw <dig>  in contrast, bj isolates contained a unique  <dig> kb pt1028-like prophage but lacked φspβ-like and φsa <dig> prophages. besides distinct mobile genetic elements  in the two clusters, ogg analyses and whole-genome alignment of these clusters highlighted differences in genes located in the core genome, including the identification of single nucleotide deletions in several genes, resulting in frameshift mutations and the subsequent predicted truncation of encoded proteins involved in metabolism and antimicrobial resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomics, based on de novo assembly and deep sequencing of hk and bj strains, revealed different origins of the st <dig> lineage in northern and southern china and identified differences between the two clades at single nucleotide polymorphism , core gene and mge levels. the results suggest that st <dig> strains isolated in hong kong since the 1990s belong to the asian clade, present mainly in southern asia, whereas those that emerged in northern china were of a distinct origin, reflecting the complexity of dissemination and the dynamic evolution of this st <dig> lineage.
