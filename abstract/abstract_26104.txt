BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis  is a chronic debilitating disease and is a cause of morbidity and mortality in livestock, wildlife and humans. this study estimated the prevalence and risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis transmission in indigenous cattle at the human-animal interface in the serengeti ecosystem of tanzania.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  indigenous cattle from  <dig> herds were investigated for the presence of btb using the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test. epidemiological data on herd structure, management and grazing system were also collected.

the apparent individual animal prevalence of tuberculin reactors was  <dig> % ,  <dig>  –  <dig> %), whereas the true prevalence was  <dig> % ci,  <dig>  –  <dig> % as indicated by a reaction to avian tuberculin purified protein derivatives  which is more than 4 mm greater than the reaction to avian tuberculin ppd. the results showed that  <dig> %  showed non-specific reactions . the herd prevalence of 50%  was found. tuberculin skin test results were found to be significantly associated with age, location, size of the household and animal tested. of  <dig> respondents,  <dig>  individuals had not heard about bovine tuberculosis at all. thirty five percent  of respondents at least were aware of btb. about 60%  of respondents who were aware of btb had some knowledge on how btb is spread. eighty one percent  of respondents were not aware of the presence of btb in wildlife. there is regular contact between cattle and wild animals due to sharing of grazing land and water sources, with 99%  of households grazing cattle in communal pastures.


CONCLUSIONS
the study has demonstrated a high reported interaction of livestock with wildlife and poor knowledge of most cattle owners concerning btb and its transmission pathways among people, livestock and wildlife. although the overall proportion of animals with btb is relatively low, herd prevalence is 50% and prevalence within herds varied considerably. thus there is a possibility of cross transmission of btb at wildlife-livestock interface areas that necessitates use of genetic strain typing methods to characterize them accurately.
