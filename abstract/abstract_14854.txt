BACKGROUND
the poisson-boltzmann  equation and its linear approximation have been widely used to describe biomolecular electrostatics. generalized born  models offer a convenient computational approximation for the more fundamental approach based on the poisson-boltzmann equation, and allows estimation of pairwise contributions to electrostatic effects in the molecular context.


RESULTS
we have implemented in a single program most common analyses of the electrostatic properties of proteins. the program first computes generalized born radii, via a surface integral and then it uses generalized born radii  to perform electrostic analyses. in particular the ouput of the program entails, depending on user's requirement:

1) the generalized born radius of each atom;

2) the electrostatic solvation free energy;

3) the electrostatic forces on each atom ;

4) the ph-dependent properties  the pka of all ionizable groups;

6) the electrostatic potential at the surface of the molecule;

7) the electrostatic potential in a volume surrounding the molecule;


CONCLUSIONS
although at the expense of limited flexibility the program provides most common analyses with requirement of a single input file in pqr format. the results obtained are comparable to those obtained using state-of-the-art poisson-boltzmann solvers. a linux executable with example input and output files is provided as supplementary material.
