BACKGROUND
histone deacetylase inhibitors  are emerging as promising anticancer drugs alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy agents. previous research suggests that hdaci’s have a high degree of selectivity for killing cancer cells, but little is known regarding the impact of different cellular contexts on hdaci treatment. it is likely that the molecular mechanisms of hdaci’s involve processes that depend on the chromatin template, such as dna damage and repair. we sought to establish the connection between the hdaci sodium butyrate and dna double-strand break  damage in human breast cancer mcf- <dig> and non-cancerous human embryonic kidney <dig>  cells.


RESULTS
sodium butyrate inhibited the proliferation of both hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner, but the effects on mcf- <dig> cells were more obvious. this differential effect on cell growth was not explained by differences in cell cycle arrest, as sodium butyrate caused an arrest in g1/g <dig> phase and a decrease in s phase for both cell lines. at high doses of sodium butyrate or in combination with etoposide, mcf- <dig> cells formed fewer colonies than hek <dig> cells. furthermore, sodium butyrate enhanced the formation of etoposide-induced γ-h2ax foci to a greater extent in mcf- <dig> than in hek <dig> cells. the two cells also displayed differential patterns in the nuclear expression of dna dsb repair proteins, which could, in part, explain the cytotoxic effects of sodium butyrate.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies suggest that sodium butyrate treatment leads to a different degree of chromatin relaxation in hek <dig> and cancerous mcf- <dig> cells, which results in differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of etoposide in controlling damaged dna repair.
