BACKGROUND
kcnqx genes encode slowly activating-inactivating k+ channels, are linked to physiological signal transduction pathways, and mutations in them underlie diseases such as long qt syndrome , epilepsy in adults , benign familial neonatal convulsions in children , and hearing loss or tinnitus in humans . identification of kcnqx potassium channel transcripts in zebrafish  remains to be fully characterized although some genes have been mapped to the genome. using zebrafish genome resources as the source of putative kcnq sequences, we investigated the expression of kcnq1- <dig> in heart, brain and ear tissues.


RESULTS
overall expression of the kcnqx channel transcripts is similar to that found in mammals. we found that kcnq <dig> expression was highest in the heart, and also present in the ear and brain. kcnq <dig> was lowest in the heart, while kcnq <dig> was highly expressed in the brain, heart and ear. kcnq <dig> expression was highest in the ear. we analyzed zebrafish genomic clones containing putative kcnq <dig> sequences to identify transcripts and protein for this highly conserved member of the kcnq channel family. the zebrafish appears to have two kcnq <dig> genes that produce distinct mrna species in brain, ear, and heart tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the zebrafish is an attractive model for the study of the kcnq  superfamily of genes, and are important to processes involved in neuronal excitability, cardiac anomalies, epileptic seizures, and hearing loss or tinnitus.
