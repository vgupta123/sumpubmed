BACKGROUND
although a lot is known about how fibroblastic reticular cells  can regulate t lymphocytes , little is understood about whether or how t cells can regulate frcs.


RESULTS
this study shows that the absence of t cells inhibited the secretion of er-tr <dig> by splenic frcs, induced the structural disorder of frcs, down-regulated the expression of the chemokine ligands ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  and weakened the homing ability of t cells to the spleen of nude mice. transfusion of t cells from balb/c mice restored the structure and functions of frcs and recovered them. the expression of lymphotoxin -b was significantly downregulated in the absence of t cells from nude mice and was recovered after the transfusion of t cells. after the occlusion of the lt-b receptor, the frcs’ structure and functions were not restored by transfusion of t cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these data reveal that the absence of t cells will subject spleen frcs to structural and functional abnormality, and weaken the homing ability of t cells to the spleen. these changes are attributed to the t-cell- derived lt-b.
