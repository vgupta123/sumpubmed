BACKGROUND
micrornas are very small non-coding rnas that interact with microrna recognition elements  on their target messenger rnas. varying the concentration of a given microrna may influence the expression of many target proteins. yet, the expression of a specific target protein can be fine-tuned by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation to the corresponding mrna.


RESULTS
this study showed that alternative splicing of mrna is a fine-tuning mechanism in the cellular regulatory network. the splicing-regulated mres are often highly repressive mres. this phenomenon was observed not only in the hsa-mir-148a-regulated dnmt3b gene, but also in many target genes regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-181a. when a gene contains multiple mres in transcripts, such as the vegf gene, the splicing-regulated mres are again the highly repressive mres. approximately one-third of the analysable human mres in mirtarbase and tarbase can potentially perform the splicing-regulated fine-tuning. interestingly, the high  repression ratios observed in most of these splicing-regulated mres indicate associations with functions. for example, the mre-free transcripts of many oncogenes, such as n-ras and others may escape microrna-mediated suppression in cancer tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
this fine-tuning mechanism revealed associations with highly repressive mre. since high-repression mres are involved in many important biological phenomena, the described association implies that splicing-regulated mres are functional. a possible application of this observed association is in distinguishing functionally relevant mres from predicted mres.
