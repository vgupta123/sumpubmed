BACKGROUND
s. aureus is an important agent of colonization and infection in liver transplant patients. it harbors several virulence factors that can increase its pathogenicity. however, studies of virulence and molecular typing of mrsa in cirrhotic and liver transplantation patients are scarce.


RESULTS
here we use sccmec, pfge, spa typing, mlst and virulence factors to characterize mrsa isolates in pre and post liver transplantation patients. sixteen  of  <dig> cirrhotic and  <dig> of the  <dig> liver-transplanted patients  were colonized by mrsa . sccmec types i, ii and iii that are generally associated with nosocomial infections were identified in 91 % of the isolates. none of the isolates carried pvl, adhesion factors and fib gene. only three mrsa colonized isolates carried tst gene and were characterized as sccmec type i and t <dig>  ten spa types and five sts were identified; t <dig> and st <dig> were the most frequent profiles. spa types and st <dig> never described in brazil and a new spa type t <dig> were identified. nineteen pfge subtypes were found and grouped into nine types. there was a predominant cluster, which was related to the new york/japanese epidemic clone and harboured sccmec type ii identified in both cirrhotic and post-transplantation patients. based on sccmec and virulence factors the mrsa isolates belonged to ny/jpn clone seen be more similar to the usa <dig> mrsa isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
although without significance, liver-transplantation was more frequently colonized by mrsa than cirrhotic patients. the most frequent sccmec was type ii, and the predominant cluster was related to the new york/japanese clone. a new spa t <dig>  and st <dig> never reported in brazil were identified.
