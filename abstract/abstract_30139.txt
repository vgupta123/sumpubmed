BACKGROUND
following genital chlamydial infection, an early t helper type  <dig> -associated immune response precedes the activation and recruitment of specific th <dig> cells bearing distinct chemokine receptors, subsequently leading to the clearance of chlamydia. we have shown that ccr <dig>  a receptor for ccl <dig>  is crucial for protective chlamydial immunity. our laboratory and others have also demonstrated that ccl <dig> deficiencies found in man and animals can increase the susceptibility and progression of infectious diseases by modulating mucosal immunity. these findings suggest the ccr5-ccl <dig> axis is necessary for optimal chlamydial immunity. we hypothesized ccl <dig> is required for protective humoral and cellular immunity against chlamydia.


RESULTS
the present study revealed that ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> mrnas are elevated in the spleen, iliac lymph nodes , and genital mucosa following chlamydia muriduram challenge. antibody -mediated inhibition of ccl <dig> during genital chlamydial infection suppressed humoral and th <dig> > th <dig> cellular responses by splenic-, iln-, and genital mucosa-derived lymphocytes. antigen -specific proliferative responses of cd4+ t cells from spleen, ilns, and genital organs also declined after ccl <dig> inhibition.


CONCLUSIONS
the suppression of these responses correlated with delayed clearance of c. muriduram, which indicate chlamydial immunity is mediated by th <dig> immune responses driven in part by ccl <dig>  taken together with other studies, the data show that ccl <dig> mediates the temporal recruitment and activation of leukocytes to mitigate chlamydial infection through enhancing adaptive mucosal humoral and cellular immunity.
