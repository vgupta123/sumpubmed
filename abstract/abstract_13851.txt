BACKGROUND
motile cilia are essential to the survival and reproduction of many eukaryotes; they are responsible for powering swimming of protists and small multicellular organisms and drive fluids across respiratory and reproductive surfaces in mammals. although tremendous progress has been made to comprehend the biochemical basis of these complex evolutionarily-conserved organelles, few protein kinases have been reported to co-ordinate ciliary beat. here we present evidence for p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  playing a role in the ciliary beat of a multicellular eukaryote, the free-living miracidium stage of the platyhelminth parasite schistosoma mansoni.


RESULTS
fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that non-motile miracidia trapped within eggs prior to hatching displayed phosphorylated  p <dig> mapk associated with their ciliated surface. in contrast, freshly-hatched, rapidly swimming, miracidia lacked phosphorylated p <dig> mapk. western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that treatment of miracidia with the p <dig> mapk activator anisomycin resulted in a rapid, sustained, activation of p <dig> mapk, which was primarily localized to the cilia associated with the ciliated epidermal plates, and the tegument. freshly-hatched miracidia possessed swim velocities between  <dig>  -  <dig>  mm/s. strikingly, anisomycin-mediated p <dig> mapk activation rapidly attenuated swimming, reducing swim velocities by 55% after  <dig> min and 99% after  <dig> min. in contrast, sb  <dig>  a p <dig> mapk inhibitor, increased swim velocity by up to 15% over this duration. finally, by inhibiting swimming, p <dig> mapk activation resulted in early release of ciliated epidermal plates from the miracidium thus accelerating development to the post-miracidium larval stage.


CONCLUSIONS
this study supports a role for p <dig> mapk in the regulation of ciliary-beat. given the evolutionary conservation of signalling processes and cilia structure, we hypothesize that p <dig> mapk may regulate ciliary beat and beat-frequency in a variety of eukaryotes.
