BACKGROUND
 magnetic resonance spectroscopy  provides non-invasive information about the metabolic pattern of the brain parenchyma in vivo. the spectraclassifier software performs mrs pattern-recognition by determining the spectral features  which can be used objectively to classify spectra. our aim was to develop an infarct evolution classifier and a brain regions classifier in a rat model of focal ischemic stroke using spectraclassifier.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> single-voxel proton spectra obtained with a  <dig> tesla magnet at an echo time of 12 ms from non-infarcted parenchyma, subventricular zones and infarcted parenchyma were analyzed with spectraclassifier . the spectra corresponded to sprague-dawley rats  and stroke rats at day  <dig> post-stroke  and at days 7 ±  <dig> post-stroke . in the infarct evolution classifier, spectral features contributed by lactate + mobile lipids , total creatine  and mobile lipids  distinguished among non-infarcted parenchyma , acute phase of infarct  and subacute phase of infarct . in the brain regions classifier, spectral features contributed by myoinositol  and total creatine  distinguished among infarcted parenchyma , non-infarcted parenchyma  and subventricular zones .


CONCLUSIONS
spectraclassifier identified candidate biomarkers for infarct evolution  and different brain regions .
