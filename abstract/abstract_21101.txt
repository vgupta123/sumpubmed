BACKGROUND
transcription is regulated by a complex interaction of activators and repressors. the effectors of repression are large multimeric complexes which contain both the repressor proteins that bind to transcription factors and a number of co-repressors that actually mediate transcriptional silencing either by inhibiting the basal transcription machinery or by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes.


RESULTS
tblr <dig>  is a co-repressor of nuclear hormone transcription factors. a single highly conserved gene encodes a small family of protein molecules. different isoforms are produced by differential exon utilization. although the orf of the predominant form contains only  <dig> bp, the human gene occupies ~ <dig> kb of genomic dna on chromosome 3q and contains  <dig> exons. the genomic sequence overlaps with the putative dc <dig>  locus. the murine homologue is structurally similar and is also located on chromosome  <dig>  tblr <dig> is closely related  to tbl1x and tbl1y, which are located on chromosomes x and y. the expression of tblr <dig> overlaps but is distinct from that of tbl <dig>  an alternatively spliced form of tblr <dig> has been demonstrated in human material and it too has an unique pattern of expression. tblr <dig> and the homologous genes interact with proteins that regulate the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors. in resting cells tblr <dig> is primarily cytoplasmic but after perturbation the protein translocates to the nucleus. tblr <dig> co-precipitates with smrt, a co-repressor of nuclear hormone receptors, and co-precipitates in complexes immunoprecipitated by antiserum to hdac <dig>  cells engineered to over express either tblr <dig> or n- and c-terminal deletion variants, have elevated levels of endogenous n-cor. co-transfection of tblr <dig> and smrt results in increased expression of smrt. this co-repressor undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation and we suggest that the stabilization of the co-repressors by tblr <dig> occurs because of a novel mechanism that protects them from degradation. transient over expression of tblr <dig> produces growth arrest.


CONCLUSIONS
tblr <dig> is a multifunctional co-repressor of transcription. the structure of this family of molecules is highly conserved and closely related co-repressors have been found in all eukaryotic organisms. regulation of co-repressor expression and the consequent alterations in transcriptional silencing play an important role in the regulation of differentiation.
