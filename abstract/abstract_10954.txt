BACKGROUND
comparative mapping of 5s and 45s rdna by fluorescent in situ hybridization  technique is an excellent tool to determine cytogenetic relationships among closely related species.


RESULTS
in this study, the number and position of 5s and 45s rdna loci in all citrullus species and subspecies were determined. the cultivated watermelon , c. lanatus subsp. mucosospermus, c. colocynthis and c. naudinianus  had two 45s rdna loci and one 5s rdna locus which was located syntenic to one of the 45s rdna loci. c. ecirrhosus and c. lanatus subsp. lanatus had one 45s rdna locus and two 5s rdna loci, each located on a different chromosome. c. rehmii had one 5s and one 45s rdna locus positioned on different chromosomes. the distribution of 5s and 45s rdna in several species belonging to other genera in benincaseae tribe was also investigated. the distribution pattern of rdnas showed a great difference among these species.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study confirmed evolutionary closeness among cultivated watermelon , c. lanatus subsp. mucosospermus and c. colocynthis. our result also supported that c. lanatus subsp. lanatus was not a wild form of the cultivated watermelon instead was a separate crop species. in addition, present cytogenetic analysis suggested that a. naudinianus was more closely related to cucumis than to citrullus or acanthosicyos, but with a unique position and may be a link bridge between the citrullus and the cucumis.
