BACKGROUND
recently many efforts are being carried out to reduce cholesterol in foods. out of the  <dig> selected isolates that were tested using the agar well diffusion method to assess their ability to decompose cholesterol,  <dig> bacterial isolates were screened based on their cholesterol-decomposition ability in liquid media.


RESULTS
the bacterial isolate that displayed the highest cholesterol oxidase activity was identified as enterococcus hirae. the maximal growth and cholesterol decomposition were achieved with a 1-day incubation under static conditions at 37 °c in cholesterol basal medium adjusted to ph  <dig> supplemented with 1 g/l cholesterol as the substrate, no additional carbon or nitrogen sources and  <dig>  % caso <dig>  the cholesterol oxidase enzyme  produced by e. hirae was extracted at an 2so <dig> saturation level of 80 % and purified with 79 % yield, resulting in  <dig> -fold purification. the molecular weight of  was 60 kda. the optimal conditions required for the maximal activity of the purified cod enzyme produced by e. hirae were 30 min, 40 °c, ph  <dig> , substrate concentration of 1 g/l and 200 ppm of mgcl <dig>  the enzyme maintained approximately 36 % and  <dig>  % of its activity after 18 days of storage at 4–8 °c. also, the enzyme loss its activity by gradual thermal treatment, but it maintained  <dig>  % of its activity at 95 °c for 2 hr.


CONCLUSIONS
e. hirae mil- <dig> isolated from milk had a great capacity to decompose cholesterol in basal medium supplemented with cholesterol under its optimal growth conditions. decomposition process of cholesterol by this strain results from its production of cholesterol oxidase enzyme . the highest specific enzyme activity and highest purification fold of purified enzyme were achieved after using sephadex g- <dig>
