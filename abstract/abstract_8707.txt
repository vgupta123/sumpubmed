BACKGROUND
results of phylogenetic analysis are often visualized as phylogenetic trees. such a tree can typically only include up to a few hundred sequences. when more than a few thousand sequences are to be included, analyzing the phylogenetic relationships among them becomes a challenging task. the recent frequent outbreaks of influenza a viruses have resulted in the rapid accumulation of corresponding genome sequences. currently, there are more than  <dig> influenza a virus genomes in the database. there are no efficient ways of representing this huge data set as a whole, thus preventing a further understanding of the diversity of the influenza a virus genome.


RESULTS
here we present a new algorithm, "phylomap", which combines ordination, vector quantization, and phylogenetic tree construction to give an elegant representation of a large sequence data set. the use of phylomap on influenza a virus genome sequences reveals the phylogenetic relationships of the internal genes that cannot be seen when only a subset of sequences are analyzed.


CONCLUSIONS
the application of phylomap to influenza a virus genome data shows that it is a robust algorithm for analyzing large sequence data sets. it utilizes the entire data set, minimizes bias, and provides intuitive visualization. phylomap is implemented in java, and the source code is freely available at http://www.biochem.uni-luebeck.de/public/software/phylomap.html
