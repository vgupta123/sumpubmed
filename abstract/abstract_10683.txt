BACKGROUND
iron deficiency anemia is a global problem which often affects women and children of developing countries. strategy i plants, such as common bean  take up iron through a process that involves an iron reduction mechanism in their roots; this reduction is required to convert ferric iron to ferrous iron. root absorbed iron is critical for the iron nutrition of the plant, and for the delivery of iron to the shoot and ultimately the seeds. the objectives of this study were to determine the variability and inheritance for iron reductase activity in a range of genotypes and in a low × high seed iron cross , to identify quantitative trait loci  for this trait, and to assess possible associations with seed iron levels.


RESULTS
the experiments were carried out with hydroponically grown plants provided different amounts of iron varying between  <dig> and  <dig> μm fe-eddha. the parents, dor <dig> and g <dig>  plus  <dig> other cultivated or wild beans, were found to differ in iron reductase activity. based on these initial experiments, two growth conditions  were selected as treatments for evaluating the dor <dig> × g <dig> recombinant inbred lines. a single major qtl was found for iron reductase activity under iron-limited conditions  on linkage group b <dig> and another major qtl was found under iron sufficient conditions  on linkage group b <dig>  associations between the b <dig> qtl were found with several qtl for seed iron.


CONCLUSIONS
genes conditioning iron reductase activity in iron sufficient bean plants appear to be associated with genes contributing to seed iron accumulation. markers for bean iron reductase  homologues were found with in silico mapping based on common bean synteny with soybean and medicago truncatula on b <dig> and b07; however, neither locus aligned with the qtl for iron reductase activity. in summary, the qtl for iron reductase activity under iron limited conditions may be useful in environments where beans are grown in alkaline soils, while the qtl for iron reductase under sufficiency conditions may be useful for selecting for enhanced seed nutritional quality.
