BACKGROUND
bovine herpes virus type  <dig>  still causes great economic loss to the livestock industry and trade because there aren’t any available drugs that proved to be fully effective against it. in this study, the cytotoxicity and the antiviral activities of the thymus capitata extracts were evaluated for the development of new, non toxic and specific anti-herpesvirus drug. aqueous extracts , ethanolic extracts  and essential oil  of the aerial parts of thymus capitata were analyzed to determine their chemical compositions by gas chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. their cytotoxicity and antiviral activities against bovine herpesvirus type  <dig>  were evaluated by quantifying the reduction of the viral cytopathic effect using madin-darby bovine kidney cell line with colorimetric assay. t. capitata extracts were added at different stages of the viral infection to investigate and better quantify their potential inhibitory effects.


RESULTS
polyphenols and flavonoids were the major compounds found in t. capitata eo, ee and ae. the cytotoxic concentrations at 50% were  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> μg ml− <dig> for eo, ee and ae, respectively. the inhibitor concentrations at 50% for the eo, ee and ae, were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> μg ml− <dig>  respectively. the selectivity index anti-bhv- <dig> values were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for eo, ee and ae, respectively. thus, the eo extracts were the most efficient antiviral compounds. t. capitata extracts affect mainly the adsorption of bhv- <dig> virus to host cells.


CONCLUSIONS
t. capitata extracts inhibit the viral replication by interfering with the early stages of viral adsorption and replication. thus, t. capitata is a potential candidate for anti-herpesvirus treatment.
