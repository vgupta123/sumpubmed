BACKGROUND
the merozoite surface protein  <dig>  is a plasmodium protein which is involved in parasite invasion; the gene encoding it belongs to a multigene family. it has been proposed that msp <dig> paralogues seem to be functionally redundant; however, recent experiments have suggested that they could have different roles.


RESULTS
the msp <dig> multigene family has been described in newly available plasmodium genomes; phylogenetic relationships were established in  <dig> species by using different molecular evolutionary approaches for assessing functional divergence amongst msp <dig> members. gene expansion and contraction rule msp <dig> family evolution; however, some members could have had concerted evolution. molecular evolutionary analysis showed that relaxed and/or intensified selection modulated plasmodium msp <dig> paralogous evolution. furthermore, episodic diversifying selection and changes in evolutionary rates suggested that some paralogous proteins have diverged functionally.


CONCLUSIONS
even though msp <dig> has mainly evolved in line with a birth-and-death evolutionary model, gene conversion has taken place between some paralogous genes allowing them to maintain their functional redundancy. on the other hand, the evolutionary rate of some msp <dig> paralogs has become altered, as well as undergoing relaxed or intensified  selection, suggesting functional divergence. this could mean that some msp7s can form different parasite protein complexes and/or recognise different host receptors during parasite invasion. these results highlight the importance of this gene family in the plasmodium genus.
