BACKGROUND
the ability of mammalian cell lines to sustain cell specific productivity  over the full duration of bioprocess culture is a highly desirable phenotype, but the molecular basis for sustainable productivity has not been previously investigated in detail. in order to identify proteins that may be associated with a sustained productivity phenotype, we have conducted a proteomic profiling analysis of two matched pairs of monoclonal antibody-producing chinese hamster ovary  cell lines that differ in their ability to sustain productivity over a  <dig> day fed-batch culture.


RESULTS
proteomic profiling of inherent differences between the two sets of comparators using 2d-dige  and lc-ms/ms resulted in the identification of  <dig> distinct differentially expressed proteins. overlap comparisons between the two sets of cell line pairs identified  <dig> proteins  that were differentially expressed in the same direction.


CONCLUSIONS
these proteins may have an important role in sustaining high productivity of recombinant protein over the duration of a fed-batch bioprocess culture. it is possible that many of these proteins could be useful for future approaches to successfully manipulate or engineer cho cells in order to sustain productivity of recombinant protein.
