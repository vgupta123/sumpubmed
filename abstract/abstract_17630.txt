BACKGROUND
plant genetic resources  are the basic raw materials for future genetic progress and an insurance against unforeseen threats to agricultural production. an extensive characterization of pgr provides an opportunity to dissect structure, mine allelic variations, and identify diverse accessions for crop improvement. the generation challenge program  conceptualized the development of "composite collections" and extraction of "reference sets" from these for more efficient tapping of global crop-related genetic resources. in this study, we report the genetic structure, diversity and allelic richness in a composite collection of chickpea using ssr markers, and formation of a reference set of  <dig> accessions.


RESULTS
the  <dig> ssr markers detected  <dig> alleles in  <dig> accessions, of which,  <dig> were considered rare,  <dig> common and  <dig> most frequent. the alleles per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  averaged  <dig>  and the polymorphic information content was from  <dig>  to  <dig> , averaged  <dig> . marker polymorphism varied between groups of accessions in the composite collection and reference set. a number of group-specific alleles were detected:  <dig> in kabuli,  <dig> in desi, and  <dig> in wild cicer;  <dig> each in mediterranean and west asia ,  <dig> in south and south east asia , and  <dig> in african region accessions. desi and kabuli shared  <dig> alleles, while wild cicer shared  <dig> and  <dig> alleles with desi and kabuli, respectively. the accessions from ssea and wa shared  <dig> alleles, while those from mediterranean  <dig> and  <dig> alleles with wa and ssea, respectively. desi chickpea contained a higher proportion of rare alleles  than kabuli , while wild cicer accessions were devoid of rare alleles. a genotype-based reference set captured  <dig>  of the  <dig> composite collection alleles of which  <dig> were rare,  <dig> common, and  <dig> the most frequent alleles. the neighbour-joining tree diagram of this reference set represents diversity from all directions of the tree diagram of the composite collection.


CONCLUSIONS
the genotype-based reference set, reported here, is an ideal set of germplasm for allele mining, association genetics, mapping and cloning gene, and in applied breeding for the development of broad-based elite breeding lines/cultivars with superior yield and enhanced adaptation to diverse environments.
