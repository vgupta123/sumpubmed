BACKGROUND
human t-lymphotropic virus  <dig>  has been associated with leukemia/lymphoma  and myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis , in addition to other inflammatory diseases as well as infection complications. therapeutic approaches for htlv-1-related pathologies are limited. the labdane diterpene myriadenolide  is a natural product that exhibit biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity as reported for hiv and herpesvirus.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that this natural product was able to inhibit the expression of gag-pol mrna and substantially reduced the expression of the structural proteins p <dig> and gp <dig>  comparison of treated and untreated cells shows that amy alters both the morphology and the release of viral particles. the atomic force microscopy assay showed that the amy treatment reduced the number of particles on the cell surface by 47%.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the labdane diterpene myriadenolide reduced the expression of the structural proteins and the budding of viral particles, besides induces altered morphogenesis of htlv- <dig>  conferring on amy a new antiviral activity that may be useful for the development of new compounds with specific anti-htlv- <dig> activity.
