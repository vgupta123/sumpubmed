BACKGROUND
a mismatch has emerged between models and data of host-parasite evolution. theory readily predicts that parasites can promote host diversity through mechanisms such as disruptive selection. yet, despite these predictions, empirical evidence for parasite-mediated increases in host diversity remains surprisingly scant.


RESULTS
here, we document parasite-mediated disruptive selection on a natural daphnia population during a parasite epidemic. the mean susceptibility of clones collected from the population before and after the epidemic did not differ, but clonal variance and broad-sense heritability of post-epidemic clones were significantly greater, indicating disruptive selection and rapid evolution. a maximum likelihood method that we developed for detecting selection on natural populations also suggests disruptive selection during the epidemic: the distribution of susceptibilities in the population shifted from unimodal prior to the epidemic to bimodal after the epidemic. interestingly, this same bimodal distribution was retained after a generation of sexual reproduction.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide rare empirical support for parasite-driven increases in host genetic diversity, and suggest that this increase can occur rapidly.
