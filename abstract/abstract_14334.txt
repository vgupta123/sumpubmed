BACKGROUND
mannan-binding lectin  is a pattern-recognition molecule present in serum, which is involved in the innate immune defense by activating complement and promoting opsonophagocytosis. dendritic cells  are professional antigen presenting cells  that are crucial for the initiation of adaptive immunity. lipopolysaccharide  has been shown to be a strong activator of the inflammatory response and immune regulation. we first examined whether mbl modulated lps-induced cellular responses, then investigated possible mechanisms of its inhibitory effect.


RESULTS
mbl at higher concentrations  significantly attenuated lps-induced maturation of monocyte-derived dcs  and production of proinflammatory cytokines , and inhibited their ability to activate allogeneic t lymphocytes. it bound to immature mdcs at physiological calcium concentrations, and was optimal at supraphysiological calcium concentrations. mbl also bound directly to immature mdcs and attenuated the binding of lps to the cell surfaces, resulting in decreased lps-induced nuclear factor-Îºb  activity in these cells.


CONCLUSIONS
all these data suggest that mbl could affect the functions of dcs by modifying lps-induced cellular responses. this study supports an important role for mbl in the regulation of adaptive immune responses and inflammatory responses.
