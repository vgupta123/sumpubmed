BACKGROUND
oxidative stress can induce cell injury in vascular endothelial cells, which is the initial event in the development of atherosclerosis. although quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  has been widely used in gene expression studies in oxidative stress injuries, using carefully validated reference genes has not received sufficient attention in related studies. the objective of this study, therefore, was to select a set of stably expressed reference genes for use in qrt-pcr normalization in oxidative stress injuries in human umbilical vein endothelial cells  induced by hydrogen peroxide .


RESULTS
using genorm analysis, we found that five stably expressed reference genes were sufficient for normalization in qrt-pcr analysis in huvecs treated with h2o <dig>  genes with the most stable expression according to genorm were u <dig>  tfrc, rplp <dig>  gapdh, and actb, and according to normfinder were alas <dig>  tfrc, u <dig>  gapdh, and actb.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our study demonstrated that the expression stability of reference genes may differ according to the statistical program used. u <dig>  tfrc, rplp <dig>  gapdh, and actb was the optimal set of reference genes for studies on gene expression performed by qrt-pcr assays in huvecs under oxidative stress study.
