BACKGROUND
left-right  organ asymmetries are a common feature of metazoan animals. in many cases, laterality is established by a conserved asymmetric nodal signaling cascade during embryogenesis. in most vertebrates, asymmetric nodal induction results from a cilia-driven leftward fluid flow at the left-right organizer , a ciliated epithelium present during gastrula/neurula stages. conservation of lro and flow beyond the vertebrates has not been reported yet.


RESULTS
here we study sea urchin embryos, which use nodal to establish larval lr asymmetry as well. cilia were found in the archenteron of embryos undergoing gastrulation. expression of foxj <dig> and dnah <dig> suggested that archenteron cilia were motile. cilia were polarized to the posterior pole of cells, a prerequisite of directed flow. high-speed videography revealed rotating cilia in the archenteron slightly before asymmetric nodal induction. removal of cilia through brief high salt treatments resulted in aberrant patterns of nodal expression. our data demonstrate that cilia - like in vertebrates - are required for asymmetric nodal induction in sea urchin embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these results we argue that the anterior archenteron represents a bona fide lro and propose that cilia-based symmetry breakage is a synapomorphy of the deuterostomes.
