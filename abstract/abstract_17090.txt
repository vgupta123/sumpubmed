BACKGROUND
pireshyg <dig> has been widely used as a bicistronic expression vector. however, it is not known if the vector would affect the expression of cloned genes via nonsense-mediated mrna decay , an mrna surveillance system that degrades mrna with a premature termination codon . in mammalian cells, the induction of nmd requires either a long 3'utr or the presence of an exon-junction complex downstream of a ptc. the efficiency of nmd is greater when a ptc generates longer 3'utr. pireshyg <dig> provides the first cistron gene with a long 3'utr consisting of a downstream intervening sequence , an internal ribosomal entry site  and the second cistron. therefore, we hypothesized that the first cistron genes in pireshyg <dig> are sensitized to nmd, which affects their expression levels. to examine this hypothesis, cdnas encoding human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor β chain  and its splice variant , in which the retention of a 79-base intron caused a frameshift generating  <dig> ptcs, were cloned into pireshyg <dig> and stably expressed in a murine cell line, ba/f <dig> 


RESULTS
compared with wild-type βc, the mrna levels of βc <dig> were less than one tenth and decayed faster. both translation inhibition and upf <dig> knockdown led to significantly greater up-regulation of βc <dig> than wild-type βc. however, the use of a monocistronic pmt <dig> vector abolished the up-regulatory effects of translation inhibition and upf <dig> knockdown on both wild-type βc and βc <dig>  suggesting that the nmd is attributable to a structural determinant in pireshyg <dig>  the elimination of the intron and the proximal 3'  <dig> ptcs did not alter the greater effects of translation inhibition on βc <dig>  suggesting that the first ptc, which determines 3'utr length, was sufficient to enhance nmd efficiency. thus, transcripts of ptc-harboring genes with longer 3'utr are more efficiently degraded by the vector-dependent nmd than those of wild-type genes with relatively shorter 3'utr, resulting in minimized expression of truncated mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that pireshyg <dig>  which sensitizes its bicistronic transcripts to nmd, may be useful for studying nmd but should be avoided when maximum expressions of ptc-harboring genes are required.
