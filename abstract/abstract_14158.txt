BACKGROUND
ghrelin  is now known to be an appetite-stimulating and growth hormone -releasing peptide that is predominantly synthesized and secreted from the stomachs of various vertebrate species from fish to mammals. here, we report a grln-like peptide  in a cartilaginous fish, the red stingray, dasyatis akajei.


RESULTS
the purified peptide contains  <dig> amino acids , and the serine residue at position  <dig> is modified by n-octanoic acid. the modification is the characteristic of grln. the six n-terminal amino acid residues  were identical to another elasmobranch shark grln-lp that was recently identified although it had low identity with other grln peptides. therefore, we designated this peptide stingray grln-lp. uniquely, stingray grln-lp was o-glycosylated with mucin-type glycan chains  at threonine at position  <dig>  or both serine at position  <dig>  and thr- <dig>  removal of the glycan structure by o-glycanase made the in vitro activity of stingray grln-lp decreased when it was evaluated by the increase in intracellular ca2+ concentrations using a rat ghs-r1a-expressing cell line, suggesting that the glycan structure plays an important role for maintaining the activity of stingray grln-lp.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals the structural diversity of grln and grln-lp in vertebrates.
