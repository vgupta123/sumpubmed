BACKGROUND
pathogenic chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens and have adapted successfully to human cells, causing sexually transmitted diseases or pneumonia. chlamydial outer protein n  is likely a critical effector protein secreted by the type iii secretion system in chlamydiae, which manipulates host cells. however, the mechanisms of its action remain to be clarified. in this work, we aimed to identify previously unidentified copn effector target in host cells.


RESULTS
we first performed a pull-down assay with recombinant glutathione s-transferase  fusion copn proteins  as “bait” and soluble lysates obtained from human immortal epithelial hep- <dig> cells as “prey”, followed by sds-page with mass spectroscopy . we found that a host cell protein specifically bound to gst–cpcopn, but not gst–ctcopn. ms revealed the host protein to be fructose bisphosphate aldolase a , which plays a key role in glycolytic metabolism. we also confirmed the role of aldolase a in chlamydia-infected hep- <dig> cells by using two distinct experiments for gene knockdown with an sirna specific to aldolase a transcripts, and for assessment of glycolytic enzyme gene expression levels. as a result, both the numbers of chlamydial inclusion-forming units and rpod transcripts were increased in the chlamydia-infected aldolase a knockdown cells, as compared with the wild-type hep- <dig> cells. meanwhile, chlamydial infection tended to enhance expression of aldolase a.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered that one of the c. pneumoniae copn targets is the glycolytic enzyme aldolase a. sequestering aldolase a may be beneficial to bacterial growth in infected host cells.
