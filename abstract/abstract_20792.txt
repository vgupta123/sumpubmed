BACKGROUND
hyperactive secretion and pathogenic effects of interleukin - <dig> and iga have been detected in different arthropathies. recent evidence has revealed that th <dig> cytokines regulate mucosal iga secretion. however, it is unknown whether and how il- <dig> mediates synovial iga production. here we aim to investigate the connection of synovial il- <dig> with iga production in the joint.

in this study we included synovial fluids  from patients with rheumatoid arthritis , spondyloarthritis  and osteoarthritis . the levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  transforming growth factor -β <dig>  b-cell-activating factor of the tnf family  and anti-lipopolyssacharide  immunoglobulin a were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . total iga was measured by radial immunodiffusion assay. synovial fluid-derived mononuclear cells  were stimulated with bacterial antigens or sf-conditioned media, and cytokines and iga were analyzed in the supernatants.


RESULTS
il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> were increased in sf from both ra and spa compared with oa patients. concentration of il- <dig> correlated with the disease activity score - <dig>  il- <dig> and anti-lps iga levels. bacterial-stimulated sfmcs from ra and spa patients secreted higher il- <dig> than vehicle-stimulated sfmcs. conditioned media with sf containing il- <dig> induced anti-lps iga production by sfmcs which was independent of il- <dig> activity. concentrations of synovial tgf-β <dig> and baff correlated with anti-lps and total iga levels, respectively. blockade of il- <dig> decreased the production of tgf-β <dig> and anti-lps iga by sf-stimulated sfmcs.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reports a connection between il- <dig> and iga secretion in the joint. in addition, it demonstrates that enterobacterial antigens trigger synovial il- <dig> production, and that tgf-β <dig> and baff may mediate the effect of il- <dig> on iga production. this circuit may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint diseases.
