BACKGROUND
regenerative medicine using mesenchymal stem cells  alone or combined with plasma rich in growth factors  is a rapidly growing area of clinical research and is currently also being used to treat osteoarthritis . force platform analysis has been consistently used to verify and quantify the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies for the treatment of oa in dogs including msc associated to prgf, but never with ad-msc alone.

the aim of this study was to use a force platform to measure the efficacy of intraarticular admsc administration for limb function improvement in dogs with severe oa.


RESULTS
ten lame dogs with severe hip oa and a control group of  <dig> sound dogs were used for this study. results were statistically analyzed to detect a significant increase in peak vertical force  and vertical impulse  in treated dogs. mean values of pvf and vi were significantly improved within the first three months post-treatment in the oa group, increasing 9% and  <dig> % body weight, respectively, at day  <dig>  after this, the effect seems to decrease reaching initial values.


CONCLUSIONS
intraarticular admsc therapy objectively improved limb function in dogs with hip oa. the duration of maximal effect was less than 3â€‰months.
