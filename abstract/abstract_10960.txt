BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  is a central mechanism in the generation of genomic complexity and is a major contributor to transcriptome and proteome diversity. alterations of the splicing process can lead to deregulation of crucial cellular processes and have been associated with a large spectrum of human diseases. cancer-associated transcripts are potential molecular markers and may contribute to the development of more accurate diagnostic and prognostic methods and also serve as therapeutic targets. alternative splicing-enriched cdna libraries have been used to explore the variability generated by alternative splicing. in this study, by combining the use of trapping heteroduplexes and rna amplification, we developed a powerful approach that enables transcriptome-wide exploration of the as repertoire for identifying as variants associated with breast tumor cells modulated by erbb <dig>  oncogene expression.


RESULTS
the human breast cell line  and a pool of  <dig> erbb <dig> over-expressing breast tumor samples were used independently for the construction of two as-enriched libraries. in total,  <dig>  partial cdna sequences were obtained, revealing  <dig> alternative splicing sequence-enriched tags . a subset with  <dig> multiple exon assets was compared to public databases and reported  <dig> different as events. a high success rate of rt-pcr validation  was obtained, and  <dig> novel as events were identified. the influence of erbb2-mediated expression on as regulation was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis and probe-ligation approaches in two mammary cell lines  expressing different levels of erbb <dig>  the relative expression balance between as variants from  <dig> genes was differentially modulated by erbb <dig> in this model system.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we presented a method for exploring as from any rna source in a transcriptome-wide format, which can be directly easily adapted to next generation sequencers. we identified as transcripts that were differently modulated by erbb2-mediated expression and that can be tested as molecular markers for breast cancer. such a methodology will be useful for completely deciphering the cancer cell transcriptome diversity resulting from as and for finding more precise molecular markers.
