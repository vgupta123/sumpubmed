BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a large class of tiny non-coding rnas  that regulate diverse biological processes at the posttranscriptional level by controlling mrna stability or translation. as a molecular switch, the canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway should be suppressed during the adipogenesis; however, activation of this pathway leads to the inhibition of lipid depots formation. the aim of our studies was to identify mirnas that might be involved in adipogenesis by modulating wnt signaling pathway. here we established two types of cell model, activation and repression of wnt signaling, and investigated the expression profile of micrornas using microarray assay.


RESULTS
the high throughput microarray data revealed  <dig> mirnas that might promote adipogenesis by repressing wnt signaling: mir- <dig>  mir-148a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> etc. meanwhile, we also identified  <dig> mirnas that might have negative effect on adipogenesis by activating wnt signaling: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> etc. the targets of these mirnas were also analysed by bioinformatics. to validate the predicted targets and the potential functions of these identified mirnas, the mimics of mir- <dig> were transfected into 3t3-l <dig> cells and enlarged cells with distinct lipid droplets were observed; meanwhile, transfection with the inhibitor of mir- <dig> could markedly decrease differentiation-specific factors at the transcription level, which suggested the specific role of mir- <dig> in promoting adipogenesis. tcf7l <dig>  the predicted target of mir- <dig>  is a transcription factor triggering the downstream responsive genes of wnt signaling, was blocked at transcription level. furthermore, the activity of luciferase reporter bearing tcf7l <dig> mrna 3' utr was decreased after co-transfection with mir- <dig> in hek-293ft cells. last but not least, the protein expression level of β-catenin was increased in the lithium  treated 3t3-l <dig> cells after transfection with mir- <dig>  these findings suggested that mir- <dig> could promote adipogenesis by repressing wnt signaling through targeting tcf7l <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest the presence of mirnas in two cell models, providing insights into wnt pathway-specific mirnas that can be further characterized for their potential roles in adipogenesis. to our knowledge, present study represents the first attempt to unveil the profile of mirnas involed in adipogenesis by modulating wnt signaling pathway, which contributed to deeper investigation of the mechanism of adipogenesis.
