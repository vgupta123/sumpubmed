BACKGROUND
poly polymerase is evolutionarily conserved as a responder to various forms of stress. though parp's role in cell death is well addressed, its role in development and multicellularity is still an enigma. we have previously reported the role of parp in oxidative stress induced delayed development of d. discoideum.


RESULTS
in the current study we highlight the involvement of parp during d. discoideum development. oxidative stress affects expression of aca and car <dig> thus affecting aggregation. although parp expression is not affected during oxidative stress but it is involved during normal development as confirmed by our parp down-regulation studies. constitutive parp down-regulation resulted in blocked development while no effect was observed on d. discoideum growth. interestingly, stage specific parp down-regulation arrested development at the slug stage.


CONCLUSIONS
these results emphasize that parp is essential for complex differentiation and its function may be linked to multicellularity. this is the first report where the involvement of parp during normal multicellular development in d. discoideum, an ancient eukaryote, is established which could be of evolutionary significance. thus our study adds one more role to the multitasking function of parp.
