BACKGROUND
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades play pivotal roles in mediating biotic and abiotic stress responses. in plants, mapks are classified into four major groups  according to their sequence homology and conserved phosphorylation motifs. members of group a and b have been extensively characterized, but little information on the group d mapks has been reported.


RESULTS
in this study, we isolated and characterised ghmpk <dig>  the first group d mapk gene found in cotton. southern blot analysis suggests ghmpk <dig> is single copy in the cotton genome, and rna blot analysis indicates that ghmpk <dig> transcripts accumulate following pathogen infection and treatment with multiple defense-related signal molecules. the analysis of the promoter region of ghmpk <dig> revealed a group of putative cis-acting elements related to stress responses. subcellular localization analysis suggests that ghmpk <dig> acts in the nucleus. transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing ghmpk <dig> displayed significant resistance to fungi  and bacteria  pathogen, and the transcripts of pathogen-related  genes were more rapidly and strongly induced in the transgenic plants. furthermore, transgenic arabidopsis showed reduced drought tolerance and rapid h2o <dig> accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that ghmpk <dig> might be involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, including biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways.
