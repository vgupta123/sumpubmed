BACKGROUND
the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of poly-adp-ribose are named poly-adp-ribose polymerases . parp- <dig> is a nuclear protein, which regulates a variety of cellular functions that are mainly controlled by protein-protein interactions. a previously described non-conventional bipartite nuclear localization sequence  lies in the amino-terminal dna binding domain of parp- <dig> between amino acids 1–69; however, this targeting sequence has not been experimentally examined or validated.


RESULTS
using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we found that lysines  <dig> and  <dig>  located within a previously described bipartite nls, are not required for nuclear localization of parp- <dig>  in contrast, lysine  <dig>  which is located within a predicted classical monopartite nls, was required for parp- <dig> nuclear localization. while wild type parp- <dig> interacted with importin α <dig> and to a very weak extent with importin α <dig> and importin α <dig>  the mutant parp- <dig>  did not interact with importin α <dig>  providing a molecular explanation why parp- <dig>  is not targeted to the nucleus.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide strong evidence that lysine  <dig> of parp- <dig> is a critical residue for proper nuclear targeting of parp- <dig> and consequently for the execution of its biological functions.
