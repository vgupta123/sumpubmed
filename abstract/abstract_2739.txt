BACKGROUND
a sense-antisense gene pair  is a gene pair where two oppositely transcribed genes share a common nucleotide sequence region. in eukaryotic genomes, sagps can be organized in complex sense-antisense architectures  in which at least one sense gene shares loci with two or more antisense partners. as shown in several case studies, sagps may be involved in cancers, neurological diseases and complex syndromes. however, csagas have not yet been characterized in the context of human disease or cancer.


RESULTS
we characterize five genes  organized in a csaga on 17q <dig>   and demonstrate their strong and reproducible co-regulatory transcription pattern in breast cancer tumours. genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga are located inside the smallest region of recurrent amplification on 17q <dig>  and their expression profile correlates with the dna copy number of the region. survival analysis of a group of  <dig> breast cancer patients revealed significant survival-associated individual genes and gene pairs in the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga. moreover, several of the gene pairs associated with survival, demonstrated synergistic effects. expression of genes-members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga also strongly correlated with expression of genes of erbb <dig> core region of recurrent amplification on 17q <dig>  we clearly demonstrate that the observed co-regulatory transcription profile of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga is maintained not only by a dna amplification mechanism, but also by chromatin remodelling and local transcription activation.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a novel tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga and characterized its co-regulatory transcription profile in cancerous breast tissues. we suggest that the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga represents a clinically significant transcriptional structural-functional gene module associated with amplification of the genomic region on 17q <dig>  and correlated with expression erbb <dig> amplicon core genes in breast cancer. co-expression pattern of this module correlates with histological grades and a poor prognosis in breast cancer when over-expressed. tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga maps the risks of breast cancer relapse onto the complex genomic locus on 17q <dig> .
