BACKGROUND
neutrophil migration to an inflamed site constitutes the first line of the innate immune response against invading microorganisms. given the crucial role of endogenous lectins in neutrophil mobilization and activation, lectins from exogenous sources have often been considered as putative modulators of leukocyte function. lectins purified from snake venom have been described as galactoside ligands that induce erythrocyte agglutination and platelet aggregation. this study evaluated human neutrophil migration and activation by c-type lectin bjcul purified from bothrops jararacussu venom.


RESULTS
utilizing fluorescence microscopy, we observed that biotinylated-bjcul was evenly distributed on the neutrophil surface, selectively inhibited by d-galactose. lectin was able to induce modification in the neutrophil morphology in a spherical shape for a polarized observed by optical microscopy and exposure to bjcul in a boyden chamber assay resulted in cell migration. after  <dig> minutes of incubation with bjcul we found enhanced neutrophil functions, such as respiratory burst, zymozan phagocytosis and an increase in lissosomal volume. in addition, bjcul delays late apoptosis neutrophils.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that bjcul can be implicated in a wide variety of immunological functions including first-line defense against pathogens, cell trafficking and induction of the innate immune response since lectin was capable of inducing potent neutrophil activation.
