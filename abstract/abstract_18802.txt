BACKGROUND
the pharmacological action of specific immunosuppressants is mediated by immunophilins. while cyclosporin a binds to cyclophilins, fk506/tacrolimus, rapamycin, and others bind to fk <dig> binding proteins . different physiological actions of immunophilins were described but their genuine function, however, remains elusive and is still under investigation. a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the fk <dig> binding protein  <dig> kda  as a bait and a fetal liver expression library as a prey.


RESULTS
the c-chain of complement c1q  was detected to interact with fkbp <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system and in a protein complementation assay. neither fkbp <dig>  fkbp <dig>  fkbp <dig> nor the unrelated immunophilin cypa did react with c1q-c in the yeast system stressing the specificity of the interaction. binding of c1q-c to fkbp <dig> could not be prevented in the presence of fk <dig>  demonstrating that possibly other regions than the binding pocket of the drug are responsible for the interaction of the two proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that exclusively fkbp <dig> but no other fkbps tested so far interact with the c-chain of complement c1q in the two different assays and further work will be initiated to investigate the physiological relevance of the interaction.
