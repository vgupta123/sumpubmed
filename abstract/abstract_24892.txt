BACKGROUND
strong immunity of plants to pathogenic microorganisms is often mediated by highly specific mechanisms of non-self recognition that are dependent on disease resistance  genes. the arabidopsis thaliana protein edm <dig> is required for immunity mediated by the r gene rpp <dig>  edm <dig> is nuclear localized and contains typical features of transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. in addition, to its role in immunity, edm <dig> plays also a role in promoting floral transition. this developmental function of edm <dig>  but not its role in rpp7-mediated disease resistance, seems to involve the protein kinase wnk <dig>  which physically interacts with edm <dig> in nuclei.


RESULTS
here we report that edm <dig> affects additional developmental processes which include the formation of leaf pavement cells and leaf expansion as well as the development of morphological features related to vegetative phase change. edm <dig> has a promoting effect of each of these processes. while wnk <dig> seems not to exhibit any vegetative phase change-related function, it has a promoting effect on the development of leaf pavement cells and leaf expansion. microarray data further support regulatory interactions between wnk <dig> and edm <dig>  the fact that the effects of edm <dig> and wnk <dig> on leaf pavement cell formation and leaf expansion are co-directional, while wnk <dig> counteracts the promoting effect of edm <dig> on floral transition, is surprising and suggests that wnk <dig> can modulate the activity of edm <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that edm <dig> has been co-opted to distinct regulatory modules controlling a set of different processes in plant immunity and development. wnk <dig> appears to modulate some functions of edm <dig>
