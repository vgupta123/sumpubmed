BACKGROUND
milk is a complex liquid that provides nutrition to newborns. recent reports demonstrated that milk is enriched in maternal-derived exosomes that are involved in fetal physiological and pathological conditions by transmission of exosomal mrnas, mirnas and proteins. until now, there is no such research relevant to exosomal mrnas and proteins in porcine milk, therefore, we have attempted to investigate porcine milk exosomal mrnas and proteins using rna-sequencing and proteomic analysis.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>   mrnas and  <dig>  proteins were identified. go and kegg annotation indicated that most proteins were located in the cytoplasm and participated in many immunity and disease-related pathways, and some mrnas were closely related to metabolisms, degradation and signaling pathways. interestingly,  <dig> categories of proteins were tissue-specific and detected in placenta, liver, milk, plasma and mammary. cog analysis divided the identified mrnas and proteins into  <dig> and  <dig> categories, respectively,  <dig> mrnas and  <dig> proteins appeared to be involved in cell cycle control, cell division and chromosome partitioning. additionally,  <dig> selected mrnas were identified by qpcr, meanwhile,  <dig> proteins related to immunity and cell proliferation were detected by western blot.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide the first insight into porcine milk exosomal mrna and proteins, and will facilitate further research into the physiological significance of milk exosomes for infants.
