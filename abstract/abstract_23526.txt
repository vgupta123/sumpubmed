BACKGROUND
the ability of staphylococci to grow in a wide range of salt concentrations is well documented. in this study, we aimed to clarify the role of cardiolipin  in the adaptation of staphylococcus aureus to high salinity.


RESULTS
using an improved extraction method, the analysis of phospholipid composition suggested that cl levels increased slightly toward stationary phase, but that this was not induced by high salinity. deletion of the two cl synthase genes, sa <dig>  and sa <dig> , abolished cl synthesis. the cls <dig> gene encoded the dominant cl synthase. in a cls <dig> deletion mutant, cls <dig> functioned under stress conditions, including high salinity. using these mutants, cl was shown to be unnecessary for growth in either basal or high-salt conditions, but it was critical for prolonged survival in high-salt conditions and for generation of the l-form.


CONCLUSIONS
cl is not essential for s. aureus growth under conditions of high salinity, but is necessary for survival under prolonged high-salt stress and for the generation of l-form variants.
