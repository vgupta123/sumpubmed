BACKGROUND
experimental studies in humans have yielded evidence that adaptive immune function, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies, is distinctly impaired when sleep is deprived at the time of first antigen exposure. here we examined the effects of a regular 24- hour sleep-wake cycle  and a 24-hour period of continuous wakefulness on the 7-week antibody production in  <dig> males and  <dig> females in response to the h1n <dig>  virus vaccination. the specific antibody titer in serum was assayed by the hemagglutination inhibition test on the days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> following vaccination.


RESULTS
in comparison to the sleep group, sleep-deprived males but not females had reduced serum concentration of h1n1-specific antibodies five days after vaccination, whereas antibody titers at later time points did not differ between the conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings concur with the notion that sleep is a supportive influence in the very early stage of an adaptive immune response to a viral antigen. however, our results do not support the view that acute sleep deprivation has lasting effects on the human antibody titer response to influenza vaccination.
