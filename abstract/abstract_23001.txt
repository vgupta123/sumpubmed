BACKGROUND
infarct-induced left ventricular  remodeling is a deleterious consequence after acute myocardial infarction  which may further advance to congestive heart failure. therefore, new therapeutic strategies to attenuate the effects of lv remodeling are urgently needed. salvianolic acid b  from salviae mitiorrhizae, which has been widely used in china for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention of lv remodeling targeting matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> .


RESULTS
molecular modeling and ligplot analysis revealed in silico docking of salb at the catalytic site of mmp- <dig>  following this lead, we expressed truncated mmp- <dig> which contains only the catalytic domain, and used this active protein for in-gel gelatin zymography, enzymatic analysis, and salb binding by biacore. data generated from these assays indicated that salb functioned as a competitive inhibitor of mmp- <dig>  in our rat model for cardiac remodeling, western blot, echocardiography, hemodynamic measurement and histopathological detection were used to detect the effects and mechanism of salb on cardio-protection. our results showed that in mi rat, salb selectively inhibited mmp- <dig> activities without affecting mmp- <dig> expression while no effect of salb was seen on mmp- <dig>  moreover, salb treatment in mi rat could efficiently increase left ventricle wall thickness, improve heart contractility, and decrease heart fibrosis.


CONCLUSIONS
as a competitive inhibitor of mmp- <dig>  salb presents significant effects on preventing lv structural damage and preserving cardiac function. further studies to develop salb and its analogues for their potential for cardioprotection in clinic are warranted.
