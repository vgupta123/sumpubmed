BACKGROUND
a critical aspect of the nih translational research roadmap, which seeks to accelerate the delivery of "bench-side" discoveries to patient's "bedside," is the management of the provenance metadata that keeps track of the origin and history of data resources as they traverse the path from the bench to the bedside and back. a comprehensive provenance framework is essential for researchers to verify the quality of data, reproduce scientific results published in peer-reviewed literature, validate scientific process, and associate trust value with data and results. traditional approaches to provenance management have focused on only partial sections of the translational research life cycle and they do not incorporate "domain semantics", which is essential to support domain-specific querying and analysis by scientists.


RESULTS
we identify a common set of challenges in managing provenance information across the pre-publication and post-publication phases of data in the translational research lifecycle. we define the semantic provenance framework , underpinned by the provenir upper-level provenance ontology, to address these challenges in the four stages of provenance metadata:

 provenance collection - during data generation

 provenance representation - to support interoperability, reasoning, and incorporate domain semantics

 provenance storage and propagation - to allow efficient storage and seamless propagation of provenance as the data is transferred across applications

 provenance query - to support queries with increasing complexity over large data size and also support knowledge discovery applications

we apply the spf to two exemplar translational research projects, namely the semantic problem solving environment for trypanosoma cruzi  and the biomedical knowledge repository  project, to demonstrate its effectiveness.


CONCLUSIONS
the spf provides a unified framework to effectively manage provenance of translational research data during pre and post-publication phases. this framework is underpinned by an upper-level provenance ontology called provenir that is extended to create domain-specific provenance ontologies to facilitate provenance interoperability, seamless propagation of provenance, automated querying, and analysis.
