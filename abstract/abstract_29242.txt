BACKGROUND
decoy receptor  <dig> , a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor  superfamily, is associated with anti-tumor immunity suppression. it is highly expressed in many tumors, and its expression can be regulated by the mapk/mek/erk signaling pathway. the mapk/mek/erk pathway has been reported to be a regulator in tumor occurrence, development and clonal expansion. external-signal regulated kinase  is a vital member of this pathway.


RESULTS
the expression of dcr <dig> and erk1/ <dig> in tumor tissues of gastric cancer patients was significantly higher than the non-cancerous group . there was no statistical difference among tumor tissues from patients with different ages or gender, and even of different differentiation . however, in patients with stage i gastric cancer, the dcr <dig> and erk1/ <dig> levels were significantly lower than patients with more advanced stages.


CONCLUSIONS
dcr <dig> and erk1/ <dig> play a vital role in the development of gastric cancer, and they may be new markers for indicating the efficiency of gastric cancer treatment in the future.
