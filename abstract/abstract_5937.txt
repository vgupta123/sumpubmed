BACKGROUND
the interactions between stem cells and extracellular matrix  mediated by integrins play important roles in the processes that determine stem cell fate. however, the role of ecm/integrin interaction in the formation of embryoid bodies  during cardiogenesis from murine induced pluripotent stem cells  remains unclear.


RESULTS
in the present study, collagen type i and β <dig> integrin were expressed and upregulated synergistically during the formation of mipsc-derived ebs, with a peak expression at day  <dig> of differentiation. the blockage of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction by β <dig> integrin blocking antibody resulted in the production of defective ebs that were characterized by decreased size and the absence of a shell-like layer composed of primitive endoderm cells. the quantification of spontaneous beating activity, cardiac-specific gene expression and cardiac troponin t  immunostaining showed that the cardiac differentiation of these defective mipsc-derived ebs was lower than that of control ebs.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction is required for the growth and cardiac differentiation of mipsc-derived ebs and will be helpful in future engineering of the matrix microenvironment within ebs to efficiently direct the cardiac fate of pluripotent stem cells to promote cardiovascular regeneration.
