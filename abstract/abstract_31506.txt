BACKGROUND
estrogen receptor positive  breast cancers  are heterogeneous with regard to their clinical behavior and response to therapies. the er is currently the best predictor of response to the anti-estrogen agent tamoxifen, yet up to 30â€“40% of er+bc will relapse despite tamoxifen treatment. new prognostic biomarkers and further biological understanding of tamoxifen resistance are required. we used gene expression profiling to develop an outcome-based predictor using a training set of  <dig> er+ bc samples from women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. we used clusters of highly correlated genes to develop our predictor to facilitate both signature stability and biological interpretation. independent validation was performed using  <dig> tamoxifen-treated er+ bc samples obtained from multiple institutions and treated with tamoxifen only in the adjuvant and metastatic settings.


RESULTS
we developed a gene classifier consisting of  <dig> genes belonging to  <dig> biological clusters. in the independent set of adjuvantly-treated samples, it was able to define two distinct prognostic groups . six of the  <dig> gene clusters represented pathways involved in cell cycle and proliferation. in  <dig> metastatic breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen, one of the classifier components suggesting a cellular inflammatory mechanism was significantly predictive of response.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a gene classifier that can predict clinical outcome in tamoxifen-treated er+ bc patients. whilst our study emphasizes the important role of proliferation genes in prognosis, our approach proposes other genes and pathways that may elucidate further mechanisms that influence clinical outcome and prediction of response to tamoxifen.
