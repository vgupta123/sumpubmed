BACKGROUND
although mirnas are reportedly involved in the salt stress tolerance of plants, mirna profiling in plants has largely remained restricted to glycophytes, including certain crop species that do not exhibit any tolerance to salinity. hence, this manuscript describes the results from the mirna profiling of the halophyte suaeda maritima, which is used worldwide to study salt tolerance in plants.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified from unique srna reads, with  <dig> identified using mirbase  <dig>  and an additional eight identified using the plant non-coding rna database. the presence of the precursors of seven conserved mirnas was validated in s. maritima. in addition,  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted using the ests of two mangrove plants, rhizophora mangle and heritiera littoralis, and the precursors of seven mirnas were found in s. maritima. most of the mirnas considered for characterization were responsive to nacl application, indicating their importance in the regulation of metabolic activities in plants exposed to salinity. an expression study of the novel mirnas in plants of diverse ecological and taxonomic groups revealed that two of the mirnas, sma-mir <dig> and sma-mir <dig>  were also expressed in oryza sativa, whereas another two, sma-mir <dig> and sma-mir <dig>  were only expressed in plants growing under the influence of seawater, similar to s. maritima.


CONCLUSIONS
the distribution of conserved mirnas among only  <dig> families indicated the possibility of identifying a greater number of mirnas with increase in knowledge of the genomes of more halophytes. the expression of two novel mirnas, sma-mir <dig> and sma-mir <dig>  only in plants growing under the influence of seawater suggested their metabolic regulatory roles specific to saline environments, and such behavior might be mediated by alterations in the expression of certain genes, modifications of proteins leading to changes in their activity and production of secondary metabolites as revealed by the mirna target predictions. moreover, the auxin responsive factor targeted by sma-mir <dig> could also be involved in salt tolerance because the target is conserved between species. this study also indicated that the transcriptome of one species can be successfully used to computationally predict the mirnas in other species, especially those that have similar metabolism, even if they are taxonomically separated.
