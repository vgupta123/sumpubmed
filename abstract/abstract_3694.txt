BACKGROUND
diet has a major influence on the composition of the gut microbiota, whose importance for gut health and overall well-being is increasingly recognized. knowledge is limited regarding health implications, including effects on the faecal microbiota, of feeding a diet with high content of red meat to dogs, despite some owners’ apparent preference to do so. the aim of this study was to evaluate how a diet change from commercial dry food to one with a high content of boiled minced beef and vice versa influenced the faecal microbiota, and short chain fatty acid profile in healthy, adult, client-owned dogs.


RESULTS
the diet change influenced the faecal microbiota composition and diversity . the most abundant otus in samples of dogs fed the dry food and high minced beef were affiliated with the species faecalibacterium prausnitzii and clostridia hiranonis respectively. the high minced beef diet apparently also influenced the short chain fatty acid profile, with increased isovaleric acid, as well as an increase in faecal ph. these effects were reversed when the commercial dry food was reintroduced in weeks  <dig> and  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
results of this study can aid in the understanding of how diet changes influence the faecal microbiota and metabolite content on a short-term basis. long-term studies are required to investigate potential implications for canine gut and general health.
