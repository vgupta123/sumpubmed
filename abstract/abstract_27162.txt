BACKGROUND
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with hybridization to a tiling array  is a cost-effective and routinely used method to identify protein-dna interactions or chromatin/histone modifications. the robust identification of chip-enriched regions is frequently complicated by noisy measurements. this identification can be improved by accounting for dependencies between adjacent probes on chromosomes and by modeling of biological replicates.


RESULTS
multichipmixhmm is a user-friendly r package to analyse chip-chip data modeling spatial dependencies between directly adjacent probes on a chromosome and enabling a simultaneous analysis of replicates. it is based on a linear regression mixture model, designed to perform a joint modeling of immunoprecipitated and input measurements.


CONCLUSIONS
we show the utility of multichipmixhmm by analyzing histone modifications of arabidopsis thaliana. multichipmixhmm is implemented in r and including functions in c, freely available from the cran web site: http://cran.r-project.org.
