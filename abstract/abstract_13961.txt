BACKGROUND
stearoyl-coa desaturases  are key enzymes involved in de novo monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis. they catalyze the desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-coa substrates at the delta- <dig> position, generating essential components of phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and wax esters. despite being crucial for interpreting scds roles across species, the evolutionary history of the scd gene family in vertebrates has yet to be elucidated, in particular their isoform diversity, origin and function. this work aims to contribute to this fundamental effort.


RESULTS
we show here, through comparative genomics and phylogenetics that the scd gene family underwent an unexpectedly complex history of duplication and loss events. paralogy analysis hints that scd <dig> and scd <dig> genes emerged as part of the whole genome duplications  that occurred at the stem of the vertebrate lineage. the scd <dig> gene family expanded in rodents with the parallel loss of scd <dig> in the muridae family. the scd <dig> gene expansion is also observed in the lagomorpha although without the scd <dig> loss. in the amphibian xenopus tropicalis we find a single scd <dig> gene but not scd <dig>  though this could be due to genome incompleteness. in the analysed teleost species no scd <dig> is found, while the surrounding scd5-less locus is conserved in comparison to tetrapods. in addition, the teleost scd <dig> gene repertoire expanded to two copies as a result of the teleost specific genome duplication . finally, we describe clear orthologues of scd <dig> and scd <dig> in the chondrichthian, scyliorhinus canicula, a representative of the oldest extant jawed vertebrate clade. expression analysis in s. canicula shows that whilst scd <dig> is ubiquitous, scd <dig> is mainly expressed in the brain, a pattern which might indicate an evolutionary conserved function.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the scd <dig> and scd <dig> genes emerged as part of the 2r genome duplications. we propose that the evolutionary conserved gene expression between distinct lineages underpins the importance of scd activity in the brain , in a yet to be defined role. we argue that an expression independent of an external stimulus, such as diet induced activity, emerged as a novel function in vertebrate ancestry allocated to the scd <dig> isoform in various tissues , and it was selectively maintained throughout vertebrate evolution.
