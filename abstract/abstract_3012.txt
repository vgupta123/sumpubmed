BACKGROUND
vibrio pathogenicity island- <dig>  is a  <dig> kb region present in choleragenic v. cholerae isolates that is required for growth on sialic acid as a sole carbon source. v. cholerae non-o1/o <dig> pathogenic strains also contain vpi- <dig>  which in addition to sialic acid catabolism genes also encodes a type  <dig> secretion system in these strains. vpi- <dig> integrates into chromosome  <dig> at a trna-serine site and encodes an integrase intv <dig>  that belongs to the tyrosine recombinase family. intv <dig> is required for vpi- <dig> excision from chromosome  <dig>  which occurs at very low levels, and formation of a non-replicative circular intermediate.


RESULTS
we determined the conditions and the factors that affect excision of vpi- <dig> in v. cholerae n <dig>  we demonstrate that excision from chromosome  <dig> is induced at low temperature and after sublethal uv-light irradiation treatment. in addition, after uv-light irradiation compared to untreated cells, cells showed increased expression of three genes, intv <dig> , and two putative recombination directionality factors , vefa  and vefb  encoded within vpi- <dig>  we demonstrate that along with intv <dig>  the rdf vefa is essential for excision. we constructed a knockout mutant of vefa in v. cholerae n <dig>  and found that no excision of vpi- <dig> occurred, indicating that a functional vefa gene is required for excision. deletion of the second rdf encoded by vefb did not result in a loss of excision. among vibrio species in the genome database, we identified  <dig> putative rdfs within regions that also encoded intv <dig> homologues. within each species the rdfs and their cognate intv <dig> proteins were associated with different island regions suggesting that this pairing is widespread.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that excision of vpi- <dig> is induced under some environmental stress conditions and we show for the first time that an rdf encoded within a pathogenicity island in v. cholerae is required for excision of the region.
