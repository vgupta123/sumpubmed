BACKGROUND
pim- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are a group of enzymes related to the calcium calmodulin family of protein kinases. over-expression of pim- <dig> and pim- <dig> in mice promotes the development of lymphomas, and up-regulation of pim expression has been observed in several human cancers.


RESULTS
here we show that the pim kinases are constitutively active when expressed in hek- <dig> cells and are able to phosphorylate the bcl- <dig> family member bad on three residues, ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig> in vitro and in cells. in vitro mapping showed that pim- <dig> predominantly phosphorylated ser <dig>  while pim- <dig> phosphorylated ser <dig>  but also ser <dig> and ser <dig> at a reduced rate compared to ser <dig>  pim- <dig> was found to be the least specific for ser <dig>  and the most effective at phosphorylating ser <dig> and ser <dig>  pim- <dig> was also able to phosphorylate other sites in bad in vitro, including ser <dig>  another potential in vivo site. mutation of ser <dig> to alanine prevented the phosphorylation of ser <dig> and ser <dig> by pim kinases in hek- <dig> cells, suggesting that this site must be phosphorylated first in order to make the other sites accessible. pim phosphorylation of bad was also found to promote the 14-3- <dig> binding of bad and block its association with bcl-xl.


CONCLUSIONS
all three pim kinase family members predominantly phosphorylate bad on ser <dig> and in addition are capable of phosphorylating bad on multiple sites associated with the inhibition of the pro-apoptotic function of bad in hek- <dig> cells. this would be consistent with the proposed function of pim kinases in promoting cell proliferation and preventing cell death.
