BACKGROUND
we previously described the use of tailed oligonucleotides as a means of reprogramming alternative pre-mrna splicing in vitro and in vivo. the tailed oligonucleotides that were used interfere with splicing because they contain a portion complementary to sequences immediately upstream of the target 5' splice site combined with a non-hybridizing 5' tail carrying binding sites for the hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins.

in the present study, we have tested the inhibitory activity of rna oligonucleotides carrying different tail structures.


RESULTS
we show that an oligonucleotide with a 5' tail containing the human Î²-globin branch site sequence inhibits the use of the 5' splice site of bcl-xl, albeit less efficiently than a tail containing binding sites for the hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins. a branch site-containing tail positioned at the 3' end of the oligonucleotide also elicited splicing inhibition but not as efficiently as a 5' tail. the interfering activity of a 3' tail was improved by adding a 5' splice site sequence next to the branch site sequence. a 3' tail carrying a y-shaped branch structure promoted similar splicing interference. the inclusion of branch site or 5' splice site sequences in the y-shaped 3' tail further improved splicing inhibition.


CONCLUSIONS
our in vitro results indicate that a variety of tail architectures can be used to elicit splicing interference at low nanomolar concentrations, thereby broadening the scope and the potential impact of this antisense technology.
