BACKGROUND

clostridium difficile is a spore-forming obligate anaerobe that can remain viable for extended periods, even in the presence of antibiotics, which contributes to the persistence of this bacterium as a human pathogen during host-to-host transmission and in hospital environments. we examined the structure and function of a gene product with the locus tag cdr20291_ <dig>  as part of our broader goal aimed at elucidating transcription regulatory mechanisms involved in virulence and antibiotic resistance of the recently emergent hypervirulent c. difficile strain r <dig>  cdpadr <dig> is genomically positioned near genes that are involved in stress response and virulence. in addition, it was previously reported that cdpadr <dig> and a homologue from the historical c. difficile strain  <dig>  were differentially expressed when exposed to stressors, including antibiotics.


RESULTS
the crystal structure of cdpadr <dig> was determined to  <dig>  Å resolution, which revealed that it belongs to the padr-s <dig> subfamily of padr transcriptional regulators. cdpadr <dig> binds its own promoter and other promoter regions from within the c. difficile r <dig> genome. dna binding experiments demonstrated that cdpadr <dig> binds a region comprised of inverted repeats and an at-rich core with the predicted specific binding motif, gtactatattataagta, within its own promoter that is also present in  <dig> other regions in the c. difficile r <dig> genome. mutation of the highly conserved w in α <dig> of the effector binding/oligomerization domain, which is predicted to be involved in multi-drug recognition and dimerization in other padr-s <dig> proteins, resulted in alterations of cdpadr <dig> binding to the predicted binding motif, potentially due to loss of higher order oligomerization.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that cdpadr <dig> binds a region within its own promoter consisting of the binding motif gtactatattataagta and seems to associate non-specifically with longer dna fragments in vitro, which may facilitate promoter and motif searching. this suggests that cdpadr <dig> acts as a transcriptional auto-regulator, binding specific sites within its own promoter, and is part of a broad gene regulatory network involved, in part, with environmental stress response, antibiotic resistance and virulence.
