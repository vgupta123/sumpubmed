BACKGROUND
modern sequencing technologies have massively increased the amount of data available for comparative genomics. whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing  provides a powerful basis for comparative studies. in particular, this approach holds great promise for emerging model species in fields such as evolutionary developmental biology .


RESULTS
we have sequenced early embryonic transcriptomes of two non-drosophilid dipteran species: the moth midge clogmia albipunctata, and the scuttle fly megaselia abdita. our analysis includes a third, published, transcriptome for the hoverfly episyrphus balteatus. these emerging models for comparative developmental studies close an important phylogenetic gap between drosophila melanogaster and other insect model systems. in this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of early embryonic transcriptomes across species, and use our data for a phylogenomic re-evaluation of dipteran phylogenetic relationships.


CONCLUSIONS
we show how comparative transcriptomics can be used to create useful resources for evo-devo, and to investigate phylogenetic relationships. our results demonstrate that de novo assembly of short  reads yields high-quality, high-coverage transcriptomic data sets. we use these data to investigate deep dipteran phylogenetic relationships. our results, based on a concatenation of  <dig> orthologous genes, provide support for the traditional view of clogmia being the sister group of brachycera , rather than that of culicomorpha .
