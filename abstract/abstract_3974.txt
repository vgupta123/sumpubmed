BACKGROUND
the production and accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins  in plants in response to biotic or abiotic stresses is well known and is considered as a crucial mechanism for plant defense. a pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> cdna was identified from a cacao-moniliophthora perniciosa interaction cdna library and named tcpr-4b.


RESULTS
tcpr-4b presents a barwin domain with six conserved cysteine residues, but lacks the chitin-binding site. molecular modeling of tcpr-4b confirmed the importance of the cysteine residues to maintain the protein structure, and of several conserved amino acids for the catalytic activity. in the cacao genome, tcpr-4b belonged to a small multigene family organized mainly on chromosome  <dig>  tcpr-4b rt-qpcr analysis in resistant and susceptible cacao plants infected by m. perniciosa showed an increase of expression at 48Â hours after infection  in both cacao genotypes. after the initial stage , the tcpr-4b expression was observed at all times in the resistant genotypes, while in the susceptible one the expression was concentrated at the final stages of infection . the recombinant tcpr-4b protein showed rnase, and bivalent ions dependent-dnase activity, but no chitinase activity. moreover, tcpr-4b presented antifungal action against m. perniciosa, and the reduction of m. perniciosa survival was related to ros production in fungal hyphae.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first report of a pr- <dig> showing simultaneously rnase, dnase and antifungal properties, but no chitinase activity. moreover, we showed that the antifungal activity of tcpr-4b is directly related to rnase function. in cacao, tcpr-4b nuclease activities may be related to the establishment and maintenance of resistance, and to the pcd mechanism, in resistant and susceptible cacao genotypes, respectively.
