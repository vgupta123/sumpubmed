BACKGROUND
biofilm formation by enteropathogenic escherichia coli  have been recently described in the prototype typical epec e2348/ <dig> strain and in an atypical epec o55:h <dig> strain. in this study, we sought to evaluate biofilm formation in a collection of  <dig> atypical epec strains isolated from  <dig> diarrheic and  <dig> nondiarrheic children, belonging to different serotypes. the association of biofilm formation and adhesin-related genes were also investigated.


RESULTS
biofilm formation occurred in  <dig>  strains of different serotypes, when the assays were performed at 26°c and 37°c for 24 h. among these, four strains  formed a stronger biofilm than did the others. the frequency of biofilm producers was higher among isolates from patients compared with isolates from controls . an association was found between biofilm formation and expression of type  <dig> fimbriae and curli . unlike the previously described aepec o55:h <dig>  one aepec o119:hnd strain  formed a strong biofilm and pellicle at the air-liquid interface, but did not express curli. transposon mutagenesis was used to identify biofilm-deficient mutants. transposon insertion sequences of six mutants revealed similarity with type  <dig> fimbriae , diguanylate cyclase, atp synthase f <dig>  beta subunit , and the uncharacterized yjic protein. all these mutants were deficient in biofilm formation ability.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that the ability to adhere to abiotic surfaces and form biofilm is present in an array of aepec strains. moreover, it seems that the ability to form biofilms is associated with the presence of type  <dig> fimbriae and diguanylate cyclase. characterization of additional biofilm formation mutants may reveal other mechanisms involved in biofilm formation and bring new insights into aepec adhesion and pathogenesis.
