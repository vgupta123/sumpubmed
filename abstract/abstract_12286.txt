BACKGROUND
avian malaria  is globally widespread, but considerable variation exists in infection  patterns at small spatial scales. this variation can be driven by variation in ecology, demography, and phenotypic characters, in particular those that influence the host’s resistance. generation of reactive oxygen species  is one of the host’s initial immune responses to combat parasitic invasion. however, long-term ros exposure can harm the host and the redox response therefore needs to be adjusted according to infection stage and host phenotype. here we use experimental and correlational approaches to assess the relative importance of host density, habitat composition, individual level variation and redox physiology for plasmodium infection in a wild population of great tits, parus major.


RESULTS
we found that 36% of the great tit population was infected with plasmodium  and that patterns of infection were plasmodium species-specific. first, the infection of p. circumflexum was significantly higher in areas with experimental increased host density, whereas variation in p. relictum infection was mainly attributed to age, sex and reproduction. second, great tit antioxidant responses – total and oxidizied glutathione - showed age- , sex- and plasmodium species-specific patterns between infected and uninfected individuals, but reactive oxygen metabolites  showed only a weak explanatory power for patterns of p. relictum infection. instead rom significantly increased with plasmodium parasitaemia.


CONCLUSIONS
these results identify some key factors that influence plasmodium infection in wild birds, and provide a potential explanation for the underlying physiological basis of recently documented negative effects of chronic avian malaria on survival and reproductive success.
