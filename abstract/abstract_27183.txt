BACKGROUND
lactobacillus plantarum is considered as a safe and effective probiotic microorganism. among various sources of isolation, traditionally fermented foods are considered to be rich in lactobacillus spp., which can be exploited for their probiotic attribute. antibacterial property of l. plantarum has been demonstrated against various enteric pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo systems. this study was aimed at characterizing l. plantarum isolated from kutajarista, an ayurvedic fermented biomedicine, and assessing its antagonistic property against a common enteropathogen aeromonas veronii.


RESULTS
we report the isolation of l. plantarum  from kutajarista, and efficacy of its cell free supernatant  in amelioration of cytotoxicity caused by aeromonas veronii. on the part of probiotic attributes, vr <dig> was tolerant to ph  <dig>   <dig> % bile salts and simulated gastric juice. additionally, vr <dig> also exhibited adhesive property to human intestinal ht- <dig> cell line. furthermore, cfs of vr <dig> was antibacterial to enteric pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, aeromonas veronii and clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. detailed study regarding the effect of vr <dig> cfs on a. veronii cytotoxicity showed a significant decrease in vacuole formation and detrimental cellular changes in vero cells. on the other hand, a. veronii cfs caused disruption of tight junction proteins zo- <dig> and actin in mdck cell line, which was prevented by pre-incubation with cfs of vr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to report isolation of l. plantarum  from kutajarista and characterisation for its probiotic attributes. our study demonstrates the antagonistic property of vr <dig> to a. veronii and effect of vr <dig> cfs in reduction of cellular damage caused by a. veronii in both vero and mdck cell lines.
