BACKGROUND
participation of renal cells in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal enterotoxin b  is critical for late cleansing and sequestration of the antigens facilitated by cd1d mediated antigen sensing and recognition. this is a noted deviation from the typical antigen recognition process that recruits the major histocompatibility complex class ii  molecules. the immunological importance of cd1d is underscored by its influences on the performances of natural killer t-cells and thereby mediates the innate and adaptive immune systems.


RESULTS
using diffraction-based dotready™ immunoassays, the present study showed that seb directly and specifically conjugated to cd1d. the specificity of the conjugation between seb and cd1d expressed on human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells  was further established by selective inhibition of cd1d prior to its exposure to seb. we found that seb induced the expression of cd1d on the cell surface prompting a rapid conjugation between them. the mrna transcripts encoding cd1d remained elevated potentially after completing the antigen cleansing process.


CONCLUSIONS
molecular targets associated with the delayed pathogenic response have essential therapeutic values. particularly in the event of bioterrorism, the caregivers are typically able to intervene much later than the toxic exposures. given circumstances mandate a paradigm shift from the conventional therapeutic strategy that counts on targeting the host markers responding to the early assault of pathogens. we demonstrated the role of cd1d in the late stage of pathogen recognition and cleansing, and thereby underscored its clinical potential in treating bioweaponizable antigens, such as staphylococcal enterotoxin b .
