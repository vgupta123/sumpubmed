BACKGROUND
whole-genome sequencing is an important method to understand the genetic information, gene function, biological characteristics and survival mechanisms of organisms. sequencing large genomes is very simple at present. however, we encountered a hard-to-sequence genome of pseudomonas aeruginosa phage pap <dig>  shotgun sequencing method failed to complete the sequence of this genome.


RESULTS
after persevering for 10 years and going over three generations of sequencing techniques, we successfully completed the sequence of the pap <dig> genome with a length of  <dig>  bp. single-molecule real-time sequencing results revealed that this genome contains 51 n-6-methyladenines and 152 n-4-methylcytosines. three significant modified sequence motifs were predicted, but not all of the sites found in the genome were methylated in these motifs. further investigations revealed a novel immune mechanism of bacteria, in which host bacteria can recognise and repel modified bases containing inserts in a large scale. this mechanism could be accounted for the failure of the shotgun method in pap <dig> genome sequencing. this problem was resolved using the nfi- mutant of escherichia coli dh5α as a host bacterium to construct a shotgun library.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provided insights into the hard-to-sequence phage pap <dig> genome and discovered a new mechanism of bacterial immunity. the methylome of phage pap <dig> is responsible for the failure of shotgun sequencing and for bacterial immunity mediated by enzyme endo v activity; this methylome also provides a valuable resource for future studies on pap <dig> genome replication and modification, as well as on gene regulation and host interaction.
