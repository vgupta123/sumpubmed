BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes is one of the leading non-infectious diseases worldwide and closely relates to excess adipose tissue accumulation as seen in obesity. specifically, hypertrophic expansion of adipose tissues is related to increased cardiometabolic risk leading to type  <dig> diabetes. studying mechanisms underlying adipocyte hypertrophy could lead to the identification of potential targets for the treatment of these conditions.


RESULTS
we present itc1390adip, a highly curated metabolic network of the human adipocyte presenting various improvements over the previously published iadipocytes <dig>  itc1390adip contains  <dig> genes,  <dig> reactions and  <dig> metabolites. we validated the network obtaining  <dig> % accuracy by comparing experimental gene essentiality in various cell lines to our predictions of biomass production. using flux balance analysis under various test conditions, we predict the effect of gene deletion on both lipid droplet and biomass production, resulting in the identification of  <dig> genes that could reduce adipocyte hypertrophy. we also used expression data from visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues to compare the effect of single gene deletions between adipocytes from each compartment.


CONCLUSIONS
we generated a highly curated metabolic network of the human adipose tissue and used it to identify potential targets for adipose tissue metabolic dysfunction leading to the development of type  <dig> diabetes.
