BACKGROUND
different polymorphisms have been described as markers to classify the lineages of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. the analysis of nine single nucleotide polymorphisms  was used to describe seven snps cluster groups . we attempted to classify those strains that could not been categorized into lineages by the genotyping methods used in the routine testing.


RESULTS
the m. tuberculosis complex isolates collected in  <dig> in our region were analysed. a new method based on multiplex-pcrs and pyrosequencing to analyse these snps was designed. for the pyrosequencing assay nine snps that defined the seven scgs were selected from the literature:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and gyra <dig>  in addition, snps in katg <dig>  mgtc
182
, ag85c <dig> and rdrio deletion were detected.


CONCLUSIONS
this work has permitted to achieve a better classification of aragonian strains into scgs and in some cases, to assign strains to its certain lineage. besides, the description of a new pattern shared by two isolates “scg-6c” reinforces the interest of snps to follow the evolution of m. tuberculosis complex.
