BACKGROUND
expressed sequence tags  are a source of simple sequence repeats  that can be used to develop molecular markers for genetic studies. the availability of ests for quercus robur and quercus petraea provided a unique opportunity to develop microsatellite markers to accelerate research aimed at studying adaptation of these long-lived species to their environment. as a first step toward the construction of a ssr-based linkage map of oak for quantitative trait locus  mapping, we describe the mining and survey of est-ssrs as well as a fast and cost-effective approach  to assign these markers to an approximate map position. we also compared the level of polymorphism between genomic and est-derived ssrs and address the transferability of est-ssrs in castanea sativa .


RESULTS
a catalogue of  <dig>  sanger ests was assembled into  <dig>  unigenes from which  <dig> % presented one or more ssr motifs. more than 42% of these ssrs corresponded to trinucleotides. primer pairs were designed for  <dig> putative unigenes. overall  <dig> %  were found to amplify a single polymorphic locus in a reference full-sib pedigree of quercus robur. the usefulness of these loci for establishing a genetic map was assessed using a bin mapping approach. bin maps were constructed for the male and female parental tree for which framework linkage maps based on aflp markers were available. the bin set consisting of  <dig> highly informative offspring selected based on the number and position of crossover sites. the female and male maps comprised  <dig> and  <dig> bins, with an average bin length of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. a total of  <dig> est-ssrs were assigned to bins and their map position was further validated by linkage mapping. est-ssrs were found to be less polymorphic than genomic ssrs, but their transferability rate to chestnut, a phylogenetically related species to oak, was higher.


CONCLUSIONS
we have generated a bin map for oak comprising  <dig> est-ssrs. this resource constitutes a first step toward the establishment of a gene-based map for this genus that will facilitate the dissection of qtls affecting complex traits of ecological importance.
