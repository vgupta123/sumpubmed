BACKGROUND
establishment of haematological and biochemical reference intervals is important to assess health of animals on individual and population level. reference intervals for  <dig> haematological and  <dig> biochemical variables were established based on  <dig> apparently healthy free-ranging brown bears  in sweden. the animals were chemically immobilised by darting from a helicopter with a combination of medetomidine, tiletamine and zolazepam in april and may 2006– <dig> in the county of dalarna, sweden. venous blood samples were collected during anaesthesia for radio collaring and marking for ecological studies. for each of the variables, the reference interval was described based on the 95% confidence interval, and differences due to host characteristics sex and age were included if detected. to our knowledge, this is the first report of reference intervals for free-ranging brown bears in sweden.


RESULTS
the following variables were not affected by host characteristics: red blood cell, white blood cell, monocyte and platelet count, alanine transaminase, amylase, bilirubin, free fatty acids, glucose, calcium, chloride, potassium, and cortisol. age differences were seen for the majority of the haematological variables, whereas sex influenced only mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, aspartate aminotransferase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase, β-globulin, bile acids, triglycerides and sodium.


CONCLUSIONS
the biochemical and haematological reference intervals provided and the differences due to host factors age and gender can be useful for evaluation of health status in free-ranging european brown bears.
