BACKGROUND
lameness represents the third most important health-related cause of economic loss in the dairy industry after fertility and mastitis. although, dairy mediterranean buffaloes  and dairy cows share similar breeding systems predisposing to similar herd problems, published studies exploring its relevance and role in these ruminants are still rare and incomplete. the aims of this study were to describe the clinical findings of foot disorders  in dairy mb and their influence on animal welfare, determined by assessment of locomotion score , body condition score  and cleanliness score .


RESULTS
of  <dig> multiparous mb submitted to routine trimming procedures,  <dig> buffaloes showed at least one fd. the prevalence of buffaloes affected by fds was  <dig>  %, while motility and lameness indexes were  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , respectively. overgrowth was present in  <dig>  % , corkscrew claw in  <dig>  % , interdigital phlegmon in  <dig>  % , white line abscess in  <dig>  % , digital dermatitis in  <dig>  %  and interdigital hyperplasia in  <dig>  % . simultaneous presence of fds was recorded in  <dig>  % of mb : overgrowth and corkscrew claw occurred together in  <dig>  % of cases , overgrowth and interdigital phlegmon in  <dig>  % , overgrowth and white line abscess in  <dig>  % , digital dermatitis and interdigital hyperplasia in  <dig>  % . the presence of fds was always associated with lameness , except from 23 mb with simultaneous overgrowth and interdigital phlegmon occurrence. the majority of mb within the under-conditioned group  and all those with cs >  <dig>  had a locomotion score above the threshold of normality . furthermore, foot diseases such as interdigital hyperplasia, white line abscess and digital dermatitis or interdigital hyperplasia seemed to occur more frequently associated with decreased bcs and increased cs scores.


CONCLUSIONS
this study describes for the first time the involvement of white line disease, interdigital phlegmona, digital dermatitis and interdigital hyperplasia in foot disorders of dairy mediterranean buffalo and shows their association with an impairment of animal welfare.
