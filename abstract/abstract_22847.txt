BACKGROUND
il- <dig>  a th <dig> cell-derived proinflammatory molecule, has been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis  and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis . while il- <dig> receptor  is expressed in many immune-related cells, microglia, and astrocytes, it is not known whether il- <dig> exerts a direct effect on neural stem cells  and oligodendrocytes, thus inducing inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system.

methods
we first detected il- <dig> receptor expression in nscs with immunostaining and real time pcr. we then cultured nscs with il- <dig> and determined nsc proliferation by neurosphere formation capability and cell number count, differentiation by immunostaining neural specific markers, and apoptosis of nscs by flow cytometry.


RESULTS
nscs constitutively express il-17r, and when the il-17r signal pathway was activated by adding il- <dig> to nsc culture medium, the number of nscs was significantly reduced and their ability to form neurospheres was greatly diminished. il- <dig> inhibited nsc proliferation, but did not induce cytotoxicity or apoptosis. il- <dig> hampered the differentiation of nscs into astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells . the effects of il- <dig> on nscs can be partially blocked by p <dig> mapk inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
il- <dig> blocks proliferation of nscs, resulting in significantly reduced numbers of astrocytes and opcs. thus, in addition to its proinflammatory role in the immune system, il- <dig> may also play a direct role in blocking remyelination and neural repair in the cns.
