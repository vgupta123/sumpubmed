BACKGROUND
proteolytic enzymes play central role in the biochemical mechanism of germination and intricately involved in many aspects of plant physiology and development. to study the mechanism of protein mobilization, undertaken the task of purifying and characterizing proteases, which occur transiently in germinating seeds of horse gram.


RESULTS
cysteine protease  was purified to homogeneity with  <dig> fold by four step procedure comprising crude extract, 2so <dig> fractionation, deae-cellulose and cm-sephacel chromatography from the  <dig> day germinating cotyledons of horse gram  verdc.). cprhg is a monomer with molecular mass of  <dig> k da, was determined by sds-page and gel filtration. the purified enzyme on ief showed two isoforms having pi values of  <dig>  and  <dig> . cprhg composed of high content of aspartic acid, glutamic acid and serine. the enzyme activity was completely inhibited by pcmb, iodoacetate and depc indicating cysteine and histidine residues at the active site. however, on addition of sulfhydryl reagents  reverse the strong inhibition by pcmb. the enzyme is fairly stable toward ph and temperature. immunoblot analysis shows that the enzyme synthesized as zymogen  and processed to a  <dig> kda proenzyme which was further degraded to give  <dig> kda active enzyme.


CONCLUSIONS
it appears that the newly synthesized protease is inactive, and activation takes place during germination. cprhg has a broad substrate specificity and stability in ph, temperature, etc. therefore, this protease may turn out to be an efficient choice for the pharmaceutical, medicinal, food, and biotechnology industry.
