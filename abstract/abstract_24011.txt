BACKGROUND
survival of the human pathogen, neisseria meningitidis, requires an effective response to oxidative stress resulting from the release of hydrogen peroxide by cells of the human immune system. in n. meningitidis, expression of catalase, which is responsible for detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, is controlled by oxyr, a redox responsive lysr-type regulator. oxyr responds directly to intracellular hydrogen peroxide through the reversible formation of a disulphide bond between c <dig> and c <dig> in the regulatory domain of the protein.


RESULTS
we report the first crystal structure of the regulatory domain of an oxyr protein  in the reduced state i.e. with cysteines at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  the protein was crystallized under reducing conditions and the structure determined to a resolution of  <dig>  Å. the overall fold of the neisseria oxyr shows a high degree of similarity to the structure of a c199s mutant oxyr from e. coli, which cannot form the redox sensitive disulphide. in the neisserial structure, c <dig> is located at the start of helix α <dig>  separated by  <dig> Å from c <dig>  which is positioned between helices α <dig> and α <dig>  in common with other lysr-type regulators, full length oxyr proteins are known to assemble into tetramers. modelling of the full length neisserial oxyr as a tetramer indicated that c <dig> and c <dig> are located close to the dimer-dimer interface in the assembled tetramer. the formation of the c199-c <dig> disulphide may thus affect the quaternary structure of the protein.


CONCLUSIONS
given the high level of structural similarity between oxyr from n. meningitidis and e. coli, we conclude that the redox response mechanism is likely to be similar in both species, involving the reversible formation of a disulphide between c199-c <dig>  modelling suggests that disulphide formation would directly affect the interface between regulatory domains in an oxyr tetramer which in turn may lead to an alteration in the spacing/orientation of the dna-binding domains and hence the interaction of oxyr with its dna binding sites.
