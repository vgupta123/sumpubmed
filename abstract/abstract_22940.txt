BACKGROUND
osteosarcoma  is a common malignant bone tumor of large breed dogs that occurs at predictable anatomic sites. at the time of initial diagnosis, most affected dogs have occult pulmonary metastases. even with aggressive surgical treatment combined with chemotherapy, the majority of dogs diagnosed with osa live less than  <dig> year from the time of diagnosis. the ability to identify canine osa cases most responsive to treatment is needed. in humans, osa is also an aggressive tumor that is histologically and molecularly similar to canine osa. the expression of the tumor suppressor gene product p <dig> by human osa tissue has been linked to a favorable response to chemotherapy.


RESULTS
we identified an antibody that binds canine p <dig> and developed a canine osa tissue microarray in order to test the hypothesis that p <dig> expression by canine osa tissue is predictive of clinical outcome following amputation and chemotherapy. although statistical significance was not reached, a trend was identified between the lack of canine osa p <dig> expression and a shorter disease free interval.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of a molecular marker for canine osa is an important goal and the results reported here justify a larger study.
