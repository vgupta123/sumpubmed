BACKGROUND
there is increasing evidence that perioperative use of nsaids may compromise the integrity of intestinal anastomoses. this study aims to characterize the negative effects of carprofen on early anastomotic healing in the rat ileum.


RESULTS
in  <dig> male wistar rats an anastomosis was constructed in the ileum. in experiment  <dig> eighty-four rats were divided over control and experimental groups, which received daily buprenorphine or carprofen, respectively, as an analgesic and were killed on day  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> after surgery. in experiment  <dig> three groups of  <dig> rats received carprofen either immediately after surgery or with a delay of  <dig> or  <dig> days. animals were killed after  <dig> days of carprofen administration. in experiment  <dig> three groups of  <dig> rats received different doses  of carprofen from surgery.

in significant contrast to buprenorphine, which never did so, carprofen induced frequent signs of anastomotic leakage, which were already present at day  <dig>  if first administration was delayed for  <dig> hours, the leakage rate was significantly reduced . throughout the study, the anastomotic bursting pressure was lowest in animals who displayed signs of anastomotic leakage. loss of anastomotic integrity did not coincide with reduced levels of hydroxyproline or increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases.


CONCLUSIONS
carprofen interferes with wound healing in the rat ileum at a very early stage. although the mechanisms responsible remain to be fully elucidated, one should be aware of the potential of nsaids to interfere with the early phase of wound repair.
