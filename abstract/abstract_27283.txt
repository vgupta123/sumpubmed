BACKGROUND
micrornas  are approximately 20- <dig> nt non-coding rnas that play key roles in many biological processes in both animals and plants. although a number of mirnas were identified in maize, the function of mirna in seed development was merely discussed.


RESULTS
in this study, two small rna libraries were sequenced, and a total reads of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> were generated from developing seeds and growing leaves, respectively. further analysis identified  <dig> known mirnas in seeds and  <dig> known mirnas in leaves.  <dig> novel mirnas were identified and they were not reported in other plants. additionally, some mirna*s of these novel mirnas were detected. potential targets of all novel mirnas were predicted based on our strict criteria. in addition to deep-sequencing, mirna microarray study confirmed the higher expression of several mirnas in seeds. in summary, our results indicated the distinct expression of mirnas during seed development.


CONCLUSIONS
we had identified  <dig> and  <dig> known mirnas from seeds and leaves in maize, and a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were discovered. the different mirna expression profile in developing seeds were revealed by both sequencing and microarray studies.
