BACKGROUND
maternal antibodies can interfere with foot-and-mouth disease vaccination. in this study we determined whether intratypic heterologous vaccination could help to improve herd immunity.


RESULTS
in unvaccinated calves, a half-life of maternal antibodies of  <dig> days was determined. at two weeks of age, calves without maternal antibodies showed a good antibody response against both vaccines used in the trial, while in calves with maternal antibodies no antibody response to homologous vaccination  but a limited antibody response to intratypic heterologous vaccination  was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
two weeks old calves without maternal antibodies respond well to vaccination, but when emergency vaccination is carried out in a region that uses prophylactic vaccination, using an intratypic heterologous vaccine strain may improve the immunity in calves with maternal antibodies.
