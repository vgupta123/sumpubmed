BACKGROUND
schmallenberg virus , akabane virus  and aino virus  are members of the simbu serogroup within the genus orthobunyavirus, family bunyaviridae, which can cause reproductive disorders including abortion, stillbirth and congenital malformation in ruminants. because, the clinical signs are similar, confirmatory diagnosis requires viral detection to differentiate infection between these three viruses.

methods
in this study, a one-step multiplex reverse-transcriptase quantitative pcr  was developed for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of sbv, akav and ainv.


RESULTS
the detection limit of the one-step mrt-qpcr for sbv, akav and ainv were  <dig>  copies ,  <dig>  copies  and  <dig>  copies , respectively. various field samples such as bovine serum, bovine whole blood, bovine brain, goat serum and culicoides were analyzed using the one-step mrt-qpcr and compared with previously published rt-qpcrs. the test results of the field samples were identical for the one-step mrt-qpcr and rt-qpcrs, which showed all samples to be negative for sbv, akav and ainv, except for one bovine brain sample  that was positive for akav.


CONCLUSIONS
the one-step mrt-qpcr allows for the simultaneous detection of three viral pathogens  that cause reproductive failure.
