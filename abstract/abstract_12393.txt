BACKGROUND
when stimulated by small molecular agonists, the a <dig> adenosine receptor  mediates cardioprotective effects without inducing detrimental hemodynamic side effects. we have examined pharmacologically the protective properties of a multivalent dendrimeric conjugate of a nucleoside as a selective multivalent agonist for the mouse a3ar.


RESULTS
a pamam dendrimer fully substituted by click chemistry on its peripheral groups with  <dig> moieties of a nucleoside agonist was shown to be potent and selective in binding to the mouse a3ar and effective in cardioprotection in an isolated mouse heart model of ischemia/reperfusion  injury. this conjugate mrs <dig> and a structurally related model compound mrs <dig> displayed binding ki values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively, and were potent in in vitro functional assays to inhibit camp production. a methanocarba  ring system in place of ribose maintained a north conformation that is preferred at the a3ar. these analogues also contained a triazole linker along with 5'-n-methyl-carboxamido and 2-alkynyl substitution, previously shown to be associated with species-independent a3ar selectivity. both mrs <dig> and mrs <dig>  were effective at increasing functional recovery of isolated mouse hearts after  <dig> min ischemia followed by  <dig> min reperfusion. a statistically significant greater improvement in the left ventricular developed pressure  by mrs <dig> compared to mrs <dig> occurred when the hearts were observed throughout reperfusion. unliganded pamam dendrimer alone did not have any effect on functional recovery of isolated perfused mouse hearts.  <dig> nm mrs <dig> did not improve functional recovery after i/r in hearts from a3ar gene "knock-out"  mice compared to control, indicating the effects of mrs <dig> were a3ar-specific.


CONCLUSIONS
covalent conjugation to a versatile drug carrier enhanced the functional potency and selectivity at the mouse a3ar and maintained the cardioprotective properties. thus, this large molecular weight conjugate is not prevented from extravasation through the coronary microvasculature.
