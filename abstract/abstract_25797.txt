BACKGROUND
intensity values measured by affymetrix microarrays have to be both normalized, to be able to compare different microarrays by removing non-biological variation, and summarized, generating the final probe set expression values. various pre-processing techniques, such as dchip, gcrma, rma and mas have been developed for this purpose. this study assesses the effect of applying different pre-processing methods on the results of analyses of large affymetrix datasets. by focusing on practical applications of microarray-based research, this study provides insight into the relevance of pre-processing procedures to biology-oriented researchers.


RESULTS
using two publicly available datasets, i.e., gene-expression data of  <dig> patients with acute myeloid leukemia  and  <dig> samples of tumor tissue of the embryonal central nervous system , we tested the effect of the four pre-processing strategies mentioned above, on  expression level measurements,  detection of differential expression,  cluster analysis and  classification of samples. in most cases, the effect of pre-processing is relatively small compared to other choices made in an analysis for the aml dataset, but has a more profound effect on the outcome of the cns dataset. analyses on individual probe sets, such as testing for differential expression, are affected most; supervised, multivariate analyses such as classification are far less sensitive to pre-processing.


CONCLUSIONS
using two experimental datasets, we show that the choice of pre-processing method is of relatively minor influence on the final analysis outcome of large microarray studies whereas it can have important effects on the results of a smaller study. the data source  is potentially of bigger importance than the choice of pre-processing method.
