BACKGROUND
recovering the network topology and associated kinetic parameter values from time-series data are central topics in systems biology. nevertheless, methods that simultaneously do both are few and lack generality.


RESULTS
here, we present a rigorous approach for simultaneously estimating the parameters and regulatory topology of biochemical networks from time-series data. the parameter estimation task is formulated as a mixed-integer dynamic optimization problem with:  binary variables, used to model the existence of regulatory interactions and kinetic effects of metabolites in the network processes; and  continuous variables, denoting metabolites concentrations and kinetic parameters values. the approach simultaneously optimizes the akaike criterion, which captures the trade-off between complexity , and accuracy of the fitting. this simultaneous optimization mitigates a possible overfitting that could result from addition of spurious regulatory interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
the capabilities of our approach were tested in one benchmark problem. our algorithm is able to identify a set of plausible network topologies with their associated parameters.
