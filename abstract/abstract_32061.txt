BACKGROUND
the bovine spongiform encephalopathy  epidemic presented homogeneity of the phenotype. this classical bse  was probably due to the contamination of the food chain by a single prion strain. however, due to the active surveillance and better techniques, two rare variants of bse have been recently reported in different continents without a clear correlation to the bse epidemic. these emerging types behave as different strains of bse and were named h-type and l-type according to the high and low molecular mass of the unglycosylated fragment of their proteinase k resistant prion protein . in these types, the proportion of the un-, mono- and di-glycosylated fragments of prp  is also atypical and represents an effective diagnostic parameter. this study evaluated the presence of such types in bovine of  <dig> years and older in belgium.


RESULTS
the belgian bse archive contained  <dig> bovines of at least  <dig> years of age. the biochemical features of their prpres were analyzed by western blot with five antibodies recognising different regions of prpres, from n- to c-terminus: 12b <dig>  9a <dig>  sha <dig>  saf <dig> and 94b <dig>  all antibodies clearly detected prpres except 12b <dig> antibody, which is specific for n-terminal region 101- <dig>  a prp region that is only retained in h-types. the glycoprofiles did correspond to that of c-type . therefore, all cases have the features of c-type bse.


CONCLUSIONS
this study supports that, among the bse cases of  <dig> years and older identified in belgium, none was apparently of the h- or l- type. this is consistent with the very rare occurrence of atypical bse and the restricted dimension of belgium. these results shed some light on the worldwide prevalence of atypical bse.
