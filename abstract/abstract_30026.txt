BACKGROUND
the mitotic exit network  is a group of proteins that form a signaling cascade that is essential for cells to exit mitosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the men has also been implicated in playing a role in cytokinesis. two components of this signaling pathway are the protein kinase dbf <dig> and its binding partner essential for its kinase activity, mob <dig>  the components of men that act upstream of dbf2-mob <dig> have been characterized, but physiological substrates for dbf2-mob <dig> have yet to be identified.


RESULTS
using a combination of peptide library selection, phosphorylation of opitmal peptide variants, and screening of a phosphosite array, we found that dbf2-mob <dig> preferentially phosphorylated serine over threonine and required an arginine three residues upstream of the phosphorylated serine in its substrate. this requirement for arginine in peptide substrates could not be substituted with the similarly charged lysine. this specificity determined for peptide substrates was also evident in many of the proteins phosphorylated by dbf2-mob <dig> in a proteome chip analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
we have determined by peptide library selection and phosphosite array screening that the protein kinase dbf2-mob <dig> preferentially phosphorylated substrates that contain an rxxs motif. a subsequent proteome microarray screen revealed proteins that can be phosphorylated by dbf2-mob <dig> in vitro. these proteins are enriched for rxxs motifs, and may include substrates that mediate the function of dbf2-mob <dig> in mitotic exit and cytokinesis. the relatively low degree of sequence restriction at the site of phosphorylation suggests that dbf <dig> achieves specificity by docking its substrates at a site that is distinct from the phosphorylation site
