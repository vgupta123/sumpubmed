BACKGROUND
retrotransposition is an important evolutionary force for the creation of new and potentially functional intronless genes which are collectively called retrogenes. many retrogenes are expressed in the testis and the gene products have been shown to actively participate in spermatogenesis and other unique functions of the male germline. we have previously reported a cluster of retrogenes in the rat genome that encode putative traf- and poz-domain proteins. two of the genes, rtdpoz-t <dig> and -t <dig> , have further been shown to be expressed specifically in the rat testis.


RESULTS
we show here that the t <dig> and t <dig> genes are also expressed in the rat embryo up to days 16â€“ <dig> of development when the genes are silenced until being re-activated in the adult testis. on database interrogation, we find that some t1/t <dig> exons are chromosomally duplicated as cassettes of  <dig> or  <dig> exons consistent with retro-duplication. the embryonic t1/t <dig> transcripts, characterised by rt-pcr-cloning and rapid amplification of cdna ends, are further found to have acquired one or more noncoding exons in the 5'-untranslated region . most importantly, the t1/t <dig> locus is embedded within a dense field of relics of transposable element  derived mainly from line <dig> and erv sequences, and the te sequences are frequently exonised through alternative splicing to form the 5'-utr sequences of the t1/t <dig> transcripts. in a case of t <dig> transcript, the 3'-end is extended into and terminated within an l <dig> sequence. since the two genes share a common exon  <dig> and are, therefore, regulated by a single promoter, a t2-to-t <dig> co-transcription model is proposed. we further demonstrate that the exonised 5'-utr te sequences could lead to the creation of upstream open reading frames resulting in translational repression.


CONCLUSIONS
exonisation of te sequences is a frequent event in the transcription of retrogenes during embryonic development and in the testis and may contribute to post-transcriptional regulation of expression of retrogenes.
