BACKGROUND
currently, a licensed vaccine for dengue virus  is not yet available. virus-like particles  have shown considerable promise for use as vaccines and have many advantages compared to many other types of viral vaccines. vlps have been found to have high immunogenic potencies, providing protection against various pathogens.


RESULTS
in the current study, four denv-vlp serotypes were successfully expressed in pichia pastoris, based on co-expression of the prm and e proteins. the effects of a tetravalent vlp vaccine were also examined. immunization with purified, recombinant, tetravalent denv1- <dig> vlps induced specific antibodies against all denv1- <dig> antigens in mice. the antibody titers were higher after immunization with the tetravalent vlp vaccine compared to titers after immunization with any of the dengue serotype vlps alone. indirect immunofluorescence assay  results indicated that sera from vlp immunized mice recognized the native viral antigens. tnf-α and il- <dig> were significantly higher in mice immunized with tetravalent denv-vlp compared to those mice received pbs. the tetravalent vlp appeared to stimulate neutralizing antibodies against each viral serotype, as shown by prnt <dig> analysis . the highest titers with the tetravalent vlp vaccine were still a little lower than the monovalent vlp against the corresponding serotype. the protection rates of tetravalent denv-vlp immune sera against challenges with denv <dig> to  <dig> serotypes in suckling mice were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 100%, respectively, indicating greater protective efficacy compared with monovalent immune sera.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide an important basis for the development of the dengue vlp as a promising non-infectious candidate vaccine for dengue infection.
