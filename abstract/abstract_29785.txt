BACKGROUND
the import of most intraperoxisomal proteins is mediated by peroxisome targeting signals at their c-termini  or n-terminal regions . both signals have been integrated in subcellular location prediction programs. however their present performance, particularly of pts2-targeting did not seem fitting for large-scale screening of sequences.


RESULTS
we modified an earlier reported pts <dig> screening method to identify pts2-containing mouse candidates using a combination of computational and manual annotation. for rapid confirmation of five new pts2- and two previously identified pts1-containing candidates we developed the new cell line cho-perred which stably expresses the peroxisomal marker dsred-pts <dig>  using cho-perred we confirmed the peroxisomal localization of pts1-targeted candidate zadh <dig>  preliminary characterization of zadh <dig> expression suggested non-pparα mediated activation. notably, none of the pts <dig> candidates located to peroxisomes.


CONCLUSIONS
in a few cases the pts may oscillate from "silent" to "functional" depending on its surface accessibility indicating the potential for context-dependent conditional subcellular sorting. overall, pts2-targeting predictions are unlikely to improve without generation and integration of new experimental data from location proteomics, protein structures and quantitative pex <dig> pts <dig> peptide binding assays.
