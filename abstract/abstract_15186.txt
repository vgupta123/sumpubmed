BACKGROUND
microglia are resident mononuclear phagocytes of the brain that become activated in response to insults including neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease and prion disease. in the central nervous system the chemokine cx3cl <dig>  is expressed by neurons and its exclusive receptor cx3cr <dig> is expressed solely on microglia. cx3cl1/cx3cr <dig> signalling is thought to maintain microglia in their resting state and disrupting this equilibrium may allow microglia to become activated. in prion disease, microglial proliferation has been suggested to contribute to overall disease progression, however, in different mouse models of neurodegeneration, loss of cx3cr <dig> has been shown to either worsen or improve the phenotype depending on the paradigm.


RESULTS
to investigate the role of cx3cl1/cx3cr <dig> signalling in prion disease we infected cx3cr <dig> null mice with three different strains of prions. following challenge with chandler/rml, me <dig> and mrc <dig> prion strains, cx3cr <dig> knockout mice showed highly significant reductions in incubation time. no differences were seen in the pattern and localisation of activated microglia in the brain or in the mrna expression levels of chemokines/cytokines .


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest a protective role for cx3cl1/cx3cr <dig> cross-talk in prion disease.
