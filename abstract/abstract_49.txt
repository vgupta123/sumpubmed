BACKGROUND
salmonella is among the most significant pathogens causing food and feed safety concerns. this study examined the rapid detection of salmonella in various types of food and feed samples by coupling loop-mediated isothermal amplification  with a novel reporter, bioluminescent assay in real-time . performance of the lamp-bart assay was compared to a conventional lamp and the commercially available 3m molecular detection assay  salmonella.


RESULTS
the lamp-bart assay was 100 % specific among  <dig> strains  tested. the detection limits were  <dig> cells per reaction in pure culture and  <dig> to 106 cfu per 25 g in spiked food and feed samples without enrichment, which were comparable to those of the conventional lamp and 3m mda salmonella but 5–10 min faster. ground turkey showed a strong inhibition on 3m mda salmonella, requiring at least 108 cfu per 25 g for detection. the correlation between salmonella cell numbers and lamp-bart signals was high , suggesting good quantification capability. after 24 h enrichment, all three assays accurately detected  <dig> to 3 cfu per 25 g of salmonella among five types of food  and three types of feed  examined. however, 101 cfu per 25 g was required for cattle feed when tested by 3m mda salmonella.


CONCLUSIONS
the salmonella lamp-bart assay was rapid, specific, sensitive, quantitative, and robust. upon further validation, it may become a valuable tool for routine screening of salmonella in various types of food and feed samples.
