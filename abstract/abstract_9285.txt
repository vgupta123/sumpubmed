BACKGROUND
internalin a  facilitates the invasion of listeria monocytogenes into a host cell. some strains of listeria monocytogenes express truncated forms of inla, which reduces invasiveness. however, few virulence-related genes other than inla have been analyzed in inla-truncated strains. in the present study, we sequenced the draft genome of strain 36-25- <dig>  an inla-truncated strain, with pyrosequencing and compared  <dig> major virulence-related genes in this strain and a clinical wild-type strain.


RESULTS
strain 36-25- <dig> possessed all of the virulence-related genes analyzed. of the analyzed genes, only  <dig> genes  differed when the nucleotide sequences of strain 36-25- <dig> and the clinical wild-type strain were compared. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences found no mutations that significantly influenced virulence in genes other than inla.


CONCLUSIONS
the virulence-associated genes in strain 36-25- <dig> differ little from those of the clinical wild-type strain, indicating that a slight mutation in the nucleotide sequence determines the virulence of the inla-truncated strain. in addition, the results suggest that, aside from inla-mediated cell invasiveness, there is almost no difference between the virulence of strain 36-25- <dig> and that of the clinical wild-type strain.
