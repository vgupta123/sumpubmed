BACKGROUND
utilising next generation sequencing to interrogate saturated bacterial mutant libraries provides unprecedented information for the assignment of genome-wide gene essentiality. exposure of saturated mutant libraries to specific conditions and subsequent sequencing can be exploited to uncover gene essentiality relevant to the condition. here we present a barcoded transposon directed insertion-site sequencing  system to define an essential gene list for streptococcus equi subsp. equi, the causative agent of strangles in horses, for the first time. the gene essentiality data for this group c streptococcus was compared to that of group a and b streptococci.


RESULTS
six barcoded variants of pgh9:iss <dig> were designed and used to generate mutant libraries containing between  <dig> - <dig>  unique mutants. tradis was performed on dna extracted from each library and data were analysed separately and as a combined master pool. gene essentiality determined that  <dig> % of the s. equi genome was essential. gene essentialities were compared to those of group a and group b streptococci, identifying concordances of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively and an overall concordance of  <dig> % between the three species.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of barcoded pgh9:iss <dig> to generate mutant libraries provides a highly useful tool for the assignment of gene function in s. equi and other streptococci. the shared essential gene set of group a, b and c streptococci provides further evidence of the close genetic relationships between these important pathogenic bacteria. therefore, the abc of gene essentiality reported here provides a solid foundation towards reporting the functional genome of streptococci.
