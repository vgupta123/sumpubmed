BACKGROUND
transgenic constructs intended to be stably established at high frequencies in
wild populations have been demonstrated to “drive” from low
frequencies in experimental insect populations. linking such population
transformation constructs to genes which render them unable to transmit pathogens
could eventually be used to stop the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria
and dengue.


RESULTS
generally, population transformation constructs with only a single transgenic
drive mechanism have been envisioned. using a theoretical modelling approach we
describe the predicted properties of a construct combining autosomal medea and
underdominant population transformation systems. we show that when combined they
can exhibit synergistic properties which in broad circumstances surpass those of
the single systems.


CONCLUSIONS
with combined systems, intentional population transformation and its reversal can
be achieved readily. combined constructs also enhance the capacity to
geographically restrict transgenic constructs to targeted populations. it is
anticipated that these properties are likely to be of particular value in
attracting regulatory approval and public acceptance of this novel technology.
