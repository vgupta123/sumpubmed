BACKGROUND
two strains of the silver fox , with markedly different behavioral phenotypes, have been developed by long-term selection for behavior. foxes from the tame strain exhibit friendly behavior towards humans, paralleling the sociability of canine puppies, whereas foxes from the aggressive strain are defensive and exhibit aggression to humans. to understand the genetic differences underlying these behavioral phenotypes fox-specific genomic resources are needed.


RESULTS
cdna from mrna from pre-frontal cortex of a tame and an aggressive fox was sequenced using the roche  <dig> flx titanium platform . over 80% of the fox reads were assembled into contigs. mapping fox reads against the fox transcriptome assembly and the dog genome identified over  <dig>  high confidence fox-specific snps. fox transcripts for approximately  <dig>  genes were identified using swissprot and the dog refseq databases. an at least 2-fold expression difference between the two samples  was observed for  <dig> genes, fewer than 3% of the total number of genes identified in the fox transcriptome.


CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome sequencing significantly expanded genomic resources available for the fox, a species without a sequenced genome. in a very cost efficient manner this yielded a large number of fox-specific snp markers for genetic studies and provided significant insights into the gene expression profile of the fox pre-frontal cortex; expression differences between the two fox samples; and a catalogue of potentially important gene-specific sequence variants. this result demonstrates the utility of this approach for developing genomic resources in species with limited genomic information.
