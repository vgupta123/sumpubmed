BACKGROUND
cggbp <dig> is a cgg-triplet repeat binding protein, which affects transcription from cgg-triplet-rich promoters such as the fmr <dig> gene and the ribosomal rna gene clusters. earlier, we reported some previously unknown functions of cggbp <dig> in gene expression during heat shock stress response. recently we had found cggbp <dig> to be a cell cycle regulatory midbody protein required for normal cytokinetic abscission in normal human fibroblasts, which have all the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms intact.


RESULTS
in this study we explored the role of cggbp <dig> in the cell cycle in various cancer cell lines. cggbp <dig> depletion by rna interference in tumor-derived cells caused an increase in the cell population at g0/g <dig> phase and reduced the number of cells in the s phase. cggbp <dig> depletion also increased the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes cdkn1a and gas <dig>  associated with reductions in histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation in their promoters. by combining rna interference and genetic mutations, we found that the role of cggbp <dig> in cell cycle involves multiple mechanisms, as single deficiencies of cdkn1a, gas <dig> as well as tp <dig>  ink4a or arf failed to rescue the g0/g <dig> arrest caused by cggbp <dig> depletion.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that cggbp <dig> expression is important for cell cycle progression through multiple parallel mechanisms including the regulation of cdkn1a and gas <dig> levels.
