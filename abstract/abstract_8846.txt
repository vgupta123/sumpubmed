BACKGROUND
microrna are small noncoding rna molecules that are involved in the control of gene expression. to investigate the role of microrna in multiple sclerosis , we performed genome-wide expression analyses of mrna and microrna in t-cells from ms patients and controls.

methods
heparin-anticoagulated peripheral blood was collected from ms-patients and healthy controls followed by isolation of t-cells. microrna and rna from t-cells was prepared and hybridized to affymetrix mir  <dig>  array and affymetrix u133plus  <dig>  human genome array , respectively. verifications were performed with real-time polymerase chain reaction  and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .


RESULTS
we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes and  <dig> differentially expressed microrna between ms patients and controls. by kolmogorov-smirnov test,  <dig> of  <dig> differentially expressed microrna were shown to affect the expression of their target genes, many of which were involved in the immune system. tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member  <dig>  was a microrna target gene significantly decreased in ms. the differential expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and the predicted microrna target gene tnfsf <dig> was verified by real-time pcr and elisa.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that microrna may be important regulatory molecules in t-cells in ms.
