BACKGROUND
inorganic phosphate is an essential nutrient required by organisms for growth. during phosphate starvation, saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the phosphate signal transduction  pathway, leading to expression of the secreted acid phosphatase, pho <dig>  the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, regulates expression of the scpho <dig> homolog  via a non-orthologous pho pathway involving genetically identified positive  and negative  regulators. the genes induced by phosphate limitation and the molecular mechanism by which pho7+ and csk1+ function are unknown. here we use a combination of molecular biology, expression microarrays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing  to characterize the role of pho7+ and csk1+ in the pho response.


RESULTS
we define the set of genes that comprise the initial response to phosphate starvation in s. pombe. we identify a conserved pho response that contains the scpho <dig> , scpho <dig> , and scgit <dig>  orthologs. we identify members of the pho <dig> regulon and characterize pho <dig> binding in response to phosphate-limitation and csk <dig> activity. we demonstrate that activation of pho1+ requires pho <dig> binding to a uas in the pho1+ promoter and that csk <dig> repression does not regulate pho <dig> enrichment. further, we find that pho7-dependent activation is not limited to phosphate-starvation, as additional environmental stress response pathways require pho7+ for maximal induction.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide a global analysis of the transcriptional response to phosphate limitation in s. pombe. our results elucidate the conserved core regulon induced in response to phosphate starvation in this ascomycete distantly related to s. cerevisiae and provide a better understanding of flexibility in environmental stress response networks.
