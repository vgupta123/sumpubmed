BACKGROUND
krüppel-like factor  <dig>  is a zinc finger transcription factor that functions in neural cell differentiation, but little is known about its genomic targets or mechanism of action in neurons.


RESULTS
we used the mouse hippocampus-derived neuronal cell line ht <dig> to identify genes regulated by klf <dig>  and we validated our findings in mouse hippocampus. we engineered ht <dig> cells to express a klf <dig> transgene under control of the tetracycline repressor, and used rna sequencing to identify genes modulated by klf <dig>  we found  <dig> genes repressed and  <dig> induced by klf <dig>  we also engineered ht <dig> cells to co-express biotin ligase and a klf <dig> fusion protein containing an n-terminal biotin ligase recognition peptide. using chromatin-streptavidin precipitation  sequencing we identified  <dig>  genomic regions where klf <dig> associated. seventy-five percent of these were within 1 kb of transcription start sites, and klf <dig> associated in chromatin with 60% of the repressed genes. we analyzed the promoters of several repressed genes containing klf <dig> chsp peaks using transient transfection reporter assays and found that klf <dig> repressed promoter activity, which was abolished after mutation of sp/klf-like motifs. knockdown or knockout of klf <dig> in ht <dig> cells caused dysregulation of klf <dig> target genes. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that klf <dig> associated in chromatin from mouse hippocampus with genes identified by chsp sequencing on ht <dig> cells, and expression of klf <dig> target genes was dysregulated in the hippocampus of neonatal klf9-null mice. gene ontology analysis revealed that klf <dig> genomic targets include genes involved in cystokeletal remodeling, wnt signaling and inflammation.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified genomic targets of klf <dig> in hippocampal neurons and created a foundation for future studies on how it functions in chromatin, and regulates neuronal morphology and survival across the lifespan.
