BACKGROUND
designing small-molecule kinase inhibitors with desirable selectivity profiles is a major challenge in drug discovery. a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of a given kinase will typically yield many compounds that inhibit more than one kinase. a series of chemical modifications are usually required before a compound exhibits an acceptable selectivity profile. rationalizing the selectivity profile for a small-molecule inhibitor in terms of the specificity-determining kinase residues for that molecule can be an important step toward the goal of developing selective kinase inhibitors.


RESULTS
here we describe s-filter, a method that combines sequence and structural information to predict specificity-determining residues for a small molecule and its kinase selectivity profile. analysis was performed on seven selective kinase inhibitors where a structural basis for selectivity is known. s-filter correctly predicts specificity determinants that were described by independent groups. s-filter also predicts a number of novel specificity determinants that can often be justified by further structural comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
s-filter is a valuable tool for analyzing kinase selectivity profiles. the method identifies potential specificity determinants that are not readily apparent, and provokes further investigation at the structural level.
