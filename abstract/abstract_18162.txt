BACKGROUND
the pattern-forming bacterium paenibacillus vortex is notable for its advanced social behavior, which is reflected in development of colonies with highly intricate architectures. prior to this study, only two other paenibacillus species  have been sequenced. however, no genomic data is available on the paenibacillus species with pattern-forming and complex social motility. here we report the de novo genome sequence of this gram-positive, soil-dwelling, sporulating bacterium.


RESULTS
the complete p. vortex genome was sequenced by a hybrid approach using  <dig> life sciences and illumina, achieving a total of 289Ã— coverage, with  <dig> % sequence identity between the two methods. the sequencing results were validated using a custom designed agilent microarray expression chip which represented the coding and the non-coding regions. analysis of the p. vortex genome revealed  <dig>  open reading frames  and  <dig> non-coding rna genes. comparative genomic analysis with  <dig> complete bacterial genomes revealed exceptionally high number of two-component system  genes, transcription factors , transport and defense related genes. additionally, we have identified genes involved in the production of antimicrobial compounds and extracellular degrading enzymes.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that p. vortex has advanced faculties to perceive and react to a wide range of signaling molecules and environmental conditions, which could be associated with its ability to reconfigure and replicate complex colony architectures. additionally, p. vortex is likely to serve as a rich source of genes important for agricultural, medical and industrial applications and it has the potential to advance the study of social microbiology within gram-positive bacteria.
