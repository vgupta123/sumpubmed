BACKGROUND
high-throughput dna methylation arrays are likely to accelerate the pace of methylation biomarker discovery for a wide variety of diseases. a potential problem with a standard set of probes measuring the methylation status of cpg sites across the whole genome is that many sites may not show inter-individual methylation variation among the biosamples for the disease outcome being studied. inclusion of these so-called "non-variable sites" will increase the risk of false discoveries and reduce statistical power to detect biologically relevant methylation markers.


RESULTS
we propose a method to estimate the proportion of non-variable cpg sites and eliminate those sites from further analyses. our method is illustrated using data obtained by hybridizing dna extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of  <dig> samples to an array assaying  <dig> cpg sites. results showed that a large proportion of the cpg sites did not show inter-individual variation in methylation.


CONCLUSIONS
our method resulted in a substantial improvement in association signals between methylation sites and outcome variables while controlling the false discovery rate at the same level.
