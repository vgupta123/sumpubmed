BACKGROUND
like all tripartite motif  proteins, the retroviral restriction factor trim5α consists of ring, b-box  <dig> and coiled-coil domains, with a c-terminal b <dig>  domain. although structures have been determined for some individual trim domains, the structure of an intact trim protein is unknown.


RESULTS
here, we express and characterize a protease-resistant 29-kd core fragment containing the b-box  <dig>  coiled coil and adjacent linker  region of trim5α. this bccl <dig> protein formed dimers and higher-order oligomers in solution. approximately 40% of the bccl <dig> secondary structure consisted of alpha helices. partial loss of alpha-helical content and dissociation of dimers occurred at 42°c, with the residual alpha helices remaining stable up to 80°c.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the b-box  <dig>  coiled-coil and linker  <dig> regions of trim5α form a core dimerization motif that exhibits a high level of alpha-helical content.
