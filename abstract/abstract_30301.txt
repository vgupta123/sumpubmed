BACKGROUND
the protist plasmodiophora brassicae is a biotrophic soil-borne pathogen that causes clubroot on brassica crops worldwide. clubroot disease is a serious threat to the 8 m ha of canola  grown annually in western canada. while host resistance is the key to clubroot management, sources of resistance are limited.


RESULTS
to identify new sources of clubroot resistance , we fine mapped a cr gene  from b. rapa ssp. chinensis to the region between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on the linkage group a <dig>  with several closely linked markers identified. transcriptome analysis was conducted using rna sequencing on a segregating f <dig> population inoculated with p. brassicae, with  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  identified between plants carrying and not carrying rcr <dig>  functional annotation of these degs showed that several defense-related biological processes, including signaling and metabolism of jasmonate and ethylene, defensive deposition of callose and biosynthesis of indole-containing compounds, were up-regulated significantly in plants carrying rcr <dig> while genes involved in salicylic acid metabolic and signaling pathways were generally not elevated. several degs involved in metabolism potentially related to clubroot symptom development, including auxin biosynthesis and cell growth/development, showed significantly lower expression in plants carrying rcr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the cr gene rcr <dig> and closely linked markers will be highly useful for breeding new resistant canola cultivars. the identification of degs between inoculated plants carrying and not carrying rcr <dig> is an important step towards understanding of specific metabolic/signaling pathways in clubroot resistance mediated by rcr <dig>  this information may help judicious use of cr genes with complementary resistance mechanisms for durable clubroot resistance.
