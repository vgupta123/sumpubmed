BACKGROUND
transmitted by the whitefly bemisia tabaci, tomato yellow leaf curly virus  has posed serious threats to plant growth and development. plant innate immune systems against various threats involve wrky group iii transcription factors . this group participates as a major component of biological processes in plants.


RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> wrky group iii tfs  were identified, and these tfs responded to tylcv infection. subcellular localization analysis indicated that solywrky <dig> and solywrky <dig> were nuclear proteins in vivo. many elements, including w-box, were found in the promoter region of group iii tfs. interaction network analysis revealed that group iii tfs could interact with other proteins, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  and isochorismate synthase , to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. positive and negative expression patterns showed that wrky group iii genes could also respond to tylcv infection in tomato. the dna content of tylcv resistant lines after solywrky <dig> and solywrky <dig> were subjected to virus-induced gene silencing  was lower than that of the control lines.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present study,  <dig> wrky group iii tfs in tomato were identified to respond to tylcv infection. quantitative real-time–polymerase chain reaction  and vigs analyses demonstrated that group iii genes served as positive and negative regulators in tomato–tylcv interaction. wrky group iii tfs could interact with other proteins by binding to cis elements existing in the promoter regions of other genes to regulate pathogen-related gene expression.
