BACKGROUND
several common aspects of endothelial phenotype, such as the expression of cell adhesion molecules, are shared between metastasis and inflammation. here, we analyzed vcam- <dig> variants as biological markers of these two types of endothelial cell activation. with the combination of 2-de and western blot techniques and the aid of tunicamycin, we analyzed n-glycosylation variants of vcam- <dig> in primary human endothelial cells stimulated with either tnf or tumoral soluble factors  derived from the human breast cancer cell line zr <dig> .


RESULTS
treatments induced a pro-adhesive endothelial phenotype. 2d western blots analysis of cells subjected to both treatments revealed the expression of the two known vcam- <dig> isoforms and of previously unknown isoforms. in particular tsfzr <dig>  induced an isoform with a relative molecular mass  and isoelectric point  of 75- <dig> kda and  <dig> , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the unknown isoforms of vcam- <dig> that were found to be overexpressed after treatment with tsf's compared with tnf, could serve as biomarkers to discriminate between inflammation and metastasis. 2d western blots revealed three new vcam- <dig> isoforms expressed in primary human endothelial cells in response to tsf stimulation. each of these isoforms varies in mr and pi and could be the result of differential glycosylation states.
