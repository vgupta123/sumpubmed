BACKGROUND
dentin sialophosphoprotein  is a multidomain, secreted protein that is critical for the formation of tooth dentin. mutations in dspp cause inherited dentin defects categorized as dentin dysplasia type ii and dentinogenesis imperfecta type ii and type iii. dentin sialoprotein , the n-terminal domain of dentin sialophosphoprotein , is a highly glycosylated proteoglycan, but little is known about the number, character, and attachment sites of its carbohydrate moieties.


RESULTS
to identify its carbohydrate attachment sites we isolated dsp from developing porcine molars and digested it with endoproteinase glu-c or pronase, fractionated the digestion products, identified fractions containing glycosylated peptides using a phenol sulfuric acid assay, and characterized the glycopeptides by n-terminal sequencing, amino acid analyses, or lc/msms. to determine the average number of sialic acid attachments per n-glycosylation, we digested dsp with glycopeptidase a, labeled the released n-glycosylations with 2-aminobenzoic acid, and quantified the moles of released glycosylations by comparison to labeled standards of known concentration. sialic acid was released by sialidase digestion and quantified by measuring Î²-nadh reduction of pyruvic acid, which was generated stoichiometrically from sialic acid by aldolase. to determine its forms, sialic acid released by sialidase digestion was labeled with  <dig> -diamino- <dig> -methyleneoxybenzene  and compared to a dmb-labeled sialic acid reference panel by rp-hplc. to determine the composition of dsp glycosaminoglycan  attachments, we digested dsp with chondroitinase abc and compared the chromotagraphic profiles of the released disaccharides to commercial standards. n-glycosylations were identified at asn <dig>  asn <dig>  asn <dig>  asn <dig>  asn <dig>  and asn <dig>  dsp averages one sialic acid per n-glycosylation, which is always in the form of n-acetylneuraminic acid. o-glycosylations were tentatively assigned at thr <dig>  thr <dig> and thr <dig>  porcine dsp gag attachments were found at ser <dig> and ser <dig> and were comprised of chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate in a ratio of  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the distribution of porcine dsp posttranslational modifications indicate that porcine dsp has an n-terminal domain with at least six n-glycosylations and a c-terminal domain with two gag attachments and at least two o-glycosylations.
