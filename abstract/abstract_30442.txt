BACKGROUND
horizontal or lateral transfer of genetic material between distantly related prokaryotes has been shown to play a major role in the evolution of bacterial and archaeal genomes, but exchange of genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is not as well understood. in particular, gene flow from eukaryotes to prokaryotes is rarely documented with strong support, which is unusual since prokaryotic genomes appear to readily accept foreign genes.


RESULTS
here, we show that abundant marine cyanobacteria in the related genera synechococcus and prochlorococcus acquired a key calvin cycle/glycolytic enzyme from a eukaryote. two non-homologous forms of fructose bisphosphate aldolase  are characteristic of eukaryotes and prokaryotes respectively. however, a eukaryotic gene has been inserted immediately upstream of the ancestral prokaryotic gene in several strains  of synechococcus and prochlorococcus. in one lineage this new gene has replaced the ancestral gene altogether. the eukaryotic gene is most closely related to the plastid-targeted fba from red algae. this eukaryotic-type fba once replaced the plastid/cyanobacterial type in photosynthetic eukaryotes, hinting at a possible functional advantage in calvin cycle reactions. the strains that now possess this eukaryotic fba are scattered across the tree of synechococcus and prochlorococcus, perhaps because the gene has been transferred multiple times among cyanobacteria, or more likely because it has been selectively retained only in certain lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
a gene for plastid-targeted fba has been transferred from red algae to cyanobacteria, where it has inserted itself beside its non-homologous, functional analogue. its current distribution in prochlorococcus and synechococcus is punctate, suggesting a complex history since its introduction to this group.
