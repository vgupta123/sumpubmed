BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stromal cells  can be obtained from potentially any tissue from the human body, but cells purified from different sources are undoubtedly different, and for each medical application, the msc with the best regenerative potential should be chosen.


RESULTS
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells , adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells  and wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells  were isolated from human tissues and were cultured under differentiation media supplemented with fetal bovine serum. we quantified the expression of stem cell and adipocyte genetic markers using quantitative real time pcr, as well as the secretion of cytokines, extracellular matrix components and growth factors using luminex and elisa. all three msc differentiated into adipogenic cells. at-msc showed the highest shift in adipoq, cebpa and pparg mrna expression. bm-msc kept high expression levels of stem-cell markers sox <dig> and pou5f <dig>  wj-msc showed the lowest increase in mrna expression when cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes. regarding protein secretion, adipocyte-like cells generated from wj-msc secreted the highest chemokine levels. at-msc-derived adipocyte-like cells secreted the lowest cytokine amounts and the highest quantity of collagen types i and iii. adipocyte-like cells obtained from bm-msc secreted high amounts of most angiogenic factors, growth factors tgf-β <dig> and tgf-β <dig>  collagens type ii and iv, heparan sulfate, laminin and aggrecan.


CONCLUSIONS
mesenchymal stromal cells purified from different tissues have a different behavior when induced to differentiate into adipocyte-like cells.
