BACKGROUND
caseous lymphadenitis  is an infectious disease that affects small ruminants and is caused by corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. this disease is responsible for high economic losses due to condemnation and trim of infected carcasses, decreased leather and wool yield, loss of sales of breeding stock and deaths from internal involvement. treatment is costly and ineffective; the most cost-effective strategy is timely immunisation. various vaccine strategies have been tested, and recombinant vaccines are a promising alternative. thus, in this study, different vaccine formulations using a recombinant protein  and the cp <dig> live recombinant strain were evaluated. five groups of  <dig> mice each were immunised with saline , rcp <dig> , cp <dig> , a combination of cp <dig> and rcp <dig>  and a heterologous prime-boost strategy . mice received two immunisations within 15 days. on day  <dig> after primary immunisation, all groups were challenged with a c. pseudotuberculosis virulent strain. mice were monitored and mortality was recorded for 30 days after challenge.


RESULTS
the g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> groups showed high levels of igg <dig> and igg2a; g <dig> presented significant igg2a production after virulent challenge in the absence of igg <dig> and igg <dig> induction. thirty days after challenge, the mice survival rates were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 60% .


CONCLUSIONS
rcp <dig> is a promising target in the development of vaccines against caseous lymphadenitis.
