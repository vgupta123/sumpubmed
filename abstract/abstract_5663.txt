BACKGROUND
the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck in hiv sexual or mother-to-infant transmission has been well documented. this results in a majority of new infections being homogeneous, i.e., initiated by a single genetic strain. early after infection, prior to the onset of the host immune response, the viral population grows exponentially. in this simple setting, an approach for estimating evolutionary and demographic parameters based on comparison of diversity measures is a feasible alternative to the existing bayesian methods , which are instead based on the simulation of genealogies.


RESULTS
we have devised a web tool that analyzes genetic diversity in acutely infected hiv- <dig> patients by comparing it to a model of neutral growth. more specifically, we consider a homogeneous infection  prior to the onset of host-induced selection, where we can assume a random accumulation of mutations. previously, we have shown that such a model successfully describes about 80% of sexual hiv- <dig> transmissions provided the samples are drawn early enough in the infection. violation of the model is an indicator of either heterogeneous infections or the initiation of selection.


CONCLUSIONS
when the underlying assumptions of our model  are met, we are under a very particular scenario for which we can use a forward approach . this allows for more computationally efficient methods to derive the time since the most recent common ancestor. furthermore, the tool performs statistical tests on the hamming distance frequency distribution, and outputs summary statistics . the tool runs within minutes and can readily accommodate the tens of thousands of sequences generated through new ultradeep pyrosequencing technologies. the tool is available on the lanl website.
