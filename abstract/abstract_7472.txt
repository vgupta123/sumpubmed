BACKGROUND
bambusoideae  comprise three distinct and well-supported lineages: tropical woody bamboos , temperate woody bamboos  and herbaceous bamboos . phylogenetic studies using chloroplast markers have generally supported a sister relationship between bambuseae and olyreae. this suggests either at least two origins of the woody bamboo syndrome in this subfamily or its loss in olyreae.


RESULTS
here a full chloroplast genome  phylogenomic study is presented using the coding and noncoding regions of  <dig> complete plastomes from the bambuseae, eight from olyreae and  <dig> from arundinarieae. trees generated using full plastome sequences support the previously recovered monophyletic relationship between bambuseae and olyreae. in addition to these relationships, several unique plastome features are uncovered including the first mitogenome-to-plastome horizontal gene transfer observed in monocots.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenomic agreement with previous published phylogenies reinforces the validity of these studies. additionally, this study presents the first published plastomes from neotropical woody bamboos and the first full plastome phylogenomic study performed within the herbaceous bamboos. although the phylogenomic tree presented in this study is largely robust, additional studies using nuclear genes support monophyly in woody bamboos as well as hybridization among previous woody bamboo lineages. the evolutionary history of the bambusoideae could be further clarified using transcriptomic techniques to increase sampling among nuclear orthologues and investigate the molecular genetics underlying the development of woody and floral tissues.
