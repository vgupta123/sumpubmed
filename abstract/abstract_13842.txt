BACKGROUND
nci <dig> cell lines are derived from cancers of  <dig> tissue origins and have been invaluable in vitro models for cancer research and anti-cancer drug screen. although extensive studies have been carried out to assess the molecular features of nci <dig> cell lines related to cancer and their sensitivities to more than  <dig>  chemical compounds, it remains unclear if and how well these cell lines represent or model their tumor tissues of origin. identification and confirmation of correct origins of nci <dig> cell lines are critical to their usage as model systems and to translate in vitro studies into clinical potentials. here we report a direct comparison between nci <dig> cell lines and primary tumors by analyzing global gene expression profiles.


RESULTS
comparative analysis suggested that  <dig> of  <dig> cell lines we analyzed represent their presumed tumors of origin. taking advantage of available clinical information of primary tumor samples used to generate gene expression profiling data, we further classified those cell lines with the correct origins into different subtypes of cancer or different stages in cancer development. for example,  <dig> of  <dig> non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were classified as lung adenocarcinomas and all of them were classified into late stages in tumor progression.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we developed and applied a novel approach for systematic comparative analysis and integrative classification of nci <dig> cell lines and primary tumors. our results could provide guidance to the selection of appropriate cell lines for cancer research and pharmaceutical compound screenings. moreover, this gene expression profile based approach can be generally applied to evaluate experimental model systems such as cell lines and animal models for human diseases.
