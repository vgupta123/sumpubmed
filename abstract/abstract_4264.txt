BACKGROUND
cancer is a complex disease where molecular mechanism remains elusive. a systems approach is needed to integrate diverse biological information for the prognosis and therapy risk assessment using mechanistic approach to understand gene interactions in pathways and networks and functional attributes to unravel the biological behaviour of tumors.


RESULTS
we weighted the functional attributes based on various functional properties observed between cancerous and non-cancerous genes reported from literature. this weighing schema was then encoded in a boolean logic framework to rank differentially expressed genes. we have identified  <dig> genes to be differentially expressed from a total of  <dig>  genes, where ten genes are reported to be down-regulated via epigenetic inactivation and seven genes are up-regulated. here, we report that the overexpressed genes irak <dig>  chek <dig> and bub <dig> may play an important role in ovarian cancer. we also show that these  <dig> genes can be used to form an ovarian cancer signature, to distinguish normal from ovarian cancer subjects and that the set of three genes, chek <dig>  ar, and lyn, can be used to classify good and poor prognostic tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
we provided a workflow using a boolean logic schema for the identification of differentially expressed genes by integrating diverse biological information. this integrated approach resulted in the identification of genes as potential biomarkers in ovarian cancer.
