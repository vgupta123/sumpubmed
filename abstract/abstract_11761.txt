BACKGROUND
the cxcr <dig> receptor and its three interferon-inducible ligands  have been implicated as playing a central role in directing a th <dig> inflammatory response. recent studies strongly support that the cxcr <dig> receptor is a very attractive therapeutic target for treating autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, and to prevent transplant rejection. we describe here the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterizations of a novel and potent small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist, sch  <dig> 


RESULTS
in this study, we evaluated in vitro pharmacological properties of sch  <dig> by radioligand receptor binding and human activated t cell chemotaxis assays. in vivo efficacy of sch  <dig> was determined by mouse collagen-induced arthritis, rat and mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and rat cardiac transplantation models. we show that sch  <dig> binds to human cxcr <dig> with a high affinity of  <dig>  nm. in addition, sch  <dig> displaces radiolabeled cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> from human cxcr <dig> with ic <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm in a non-competitive manner. sch  <dig> potently and specifically inhibits cxcr3-mediated chemotaxis in human activated t cells with ic <dig> about  <dig> nm. sch  <dig> attenuates the disease development in mouse collagen-induced arthritis model. sch  <dig> also significantly reduces disease severity in rat and mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. furthermore, sch  <dig> alone achieves dose-dependent prolongation of rat cardiac allograft survival. most significantly, sch  <dig> in combination with csa supports permanent engraftment.


CONCLUSIONS
sch  <dig> is a novel, potent and non-competitive small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist. it is efficacious in multiple preclinical disease models. these results demonstrate that therapy with cxcr <dig> antagonists may serve as a new strategy for treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and to prevent transplant rejection.
