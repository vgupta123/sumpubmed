BACKGROUND
the lateral line system in zebrafish is composed of a series of organs called neuromasts, which are distributed over the body surface. neuromasts contain clusters of hair cells, surrounded by accessory cells.


RESULTS
in this report we describe zebrafish prox <dig> mrna expression in the migrating primordium and in the neuromasts of the posterior lateral line. furthermore, using an antibody against prox <dig> we characterize expression of the protein in different cell types within neuromasts, and we show distribution among the supporting cells and hair cells.


CONCLUSIONS
functional analysis using antisense morpholinos indicates that prox <dig> activity is crucial for the hair cells to differentiate properly and acquire functionality, while having no role in development of other cell types in neuromasts.
