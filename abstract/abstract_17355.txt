BACKGROUND
regulation of meiosis and sporulation in saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model for a highly regulated developmental process. meiosis middle phase transcriptional regulation is governed by two transcription factors: the activator ndt <dig> and the repressor sum <dig>  it has been suggested that the competition between ndt <dig> and sum <dig> determines the temporal expression of their targets during middle meiosis.


RESULTS
using a combination of chip-on-chip and expression profiling, we characterized a middle phase transcriptional network and studied the relationship between ndt <dig> and sum <dig> during middle and late meiosis. while finding a group of genes regulated by both factors in a feed forward loop regulatory motif, our data also revealed a large group of genes regulated solely by ndt <dig>  measuring the expression of all ndt <dig> target genes in various genetic backgrounds , allowed us to dissect the exact transcriptional network regulating each gene, which was frequently different than the one inferred from the binding data alone.


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlight the need to perform detailed genetic experiments to determine the relative contribution of interactions in transcriptional regulatory networks.
