BACKGROUND
alzheimerâ€™s disease has been known for more than  <dig> years and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. the identification of genes involved in the processes in alzheimer affected brain is an important step towards such an understanding. genes differentially expressed in diseased and healthy brains are promising candidates.


RESULTS
based on microarray data we identify potential biomarkers as well as biomarker combinations using three feature selection methods: information gain, mean decrease accuracy of random forest and a wrapper of genetic algorithm and support vector machine . information gain and random forest are two commonly used methods. we compare their output to the results obtained from ga/svm. ga/svm is rarely used for the analysis of microarray data, but it is able to identify genes capable of classifying tissues into different classes at least as well as the two reference methods.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to the other methods, ga/svm has the advantage of finding small, less redundant sets of genes that, in combination, show superior classification characteristics. the biological significance of the genes and gene pairs is discussed.
