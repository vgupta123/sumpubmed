BACKGROUND
this study focused on utilizing pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics  modeling to optimize therapeutic dosage regimens of sarafloxacin against avian pathogenic escherichia. coli o <dig> strain in muscovy ducks. the ex vivo pk/pd study of sarafloxacin was conducted in muscovy ducks after intravenous  and oral  administrations at a single dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight . the serum samples were analyzed by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography  using a fluorescence detection method. sarafloxacin pk data were analyzed by a non-compartmental method using winnonlin software.


RESULTS
calculations of the area under the concentration-time curves  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg · h/ml following i.v. and p.o. administration, respectively. elimination half-lives  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h for i.v. injection and p.o. administration, respectively. the mean in vitro plasma protein binding of sarafloxacin was  <dig> %. integration using the sigmoid e
max model, the mean values of auc0-24h/mic needed for bacteriostatic, bactericidal and bacterial eradication action were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  h, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
sarafloxacin administered at a 10 mg/kg dose may be insufficient for treatment of e. coli o <dig> infections with an mic equally to or over  <dig>  μg/ml. furthermore, higher doses of sarafloxacin are required to minimize antimicrobial resistance considering the mpc theory.
