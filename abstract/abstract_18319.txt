BACKGROUND
this study describes a large-scale manual re-annotation of data samples in the gene expression omnibus , using variables and values derived from the national cancer institute thesaurus. a framework is described for creating an annotation scheme for various diseases that is flexible, comprehensive, and scalable. the annotation structure is evaluated by measuring coverage and agreement between annotators.


RESULTS
there were  <dig>  samples annotated with approximately  <dig> variables, in each of six disease categories – breast cancer, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and type  <dig> diabetes mellitus . the annotators provided excellent variable coverage, with known values for over 98% of three critical variables: disease state, tissue, and sample type. there was 89% strict inter-annotator agreement and 92% agreement when using semantic and partial similarity measures.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that it is possible to perform manual re-annotation of a large repository in a reliable manner.
