BACKGROUND
new sequencing technologies are rapidly emerging. many laboratories are simultaneously working with the traditional sanger ests and experimenting with ests generated by the  <dig> life science sequencers. though sanger ests have been used to generate contigs for many years, no program takes full advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information, hence, many tentative transcripts are assembled into two separate contigs. the new  <dig> technology has the benefit of high-throughput expression profiling, but introduces time and space problems for assembling large contigs.


RESULTS
the pave  assembler takes advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information by requiring that the mate-pairs be assembled into the same contig and joined by n's if the two sub-contigs do not overlap. it handles the depth of  <dig> data sets by "burying" similar ests during assembly, which retains the expression level information while circumventing time and space problems. pave uses megablast for the clustering step and cap <dig> for assembly, however it assembles incrementally to enforce the mate-pair constraint, bury ests, and reduce incorrect joins and splits. the pave data management system uses a mysql database to store multiple libraries of ests along with their metadata; the management system allows multiple assemblies with variations on libraries and parameters. analysis routines provide standard annotation for the contigs including a measure of differentially expressed genes across the libraries. a java viewer program is provided for display and analysis of the results. our results clearly show the benefit of using the pave assembler to explicitly use mate-pair information and bury ests for large contigs.


CONCLUSIONS
the pave assembler provides a software package for assembling sanger and/or  <dig> ests. the assembly software, data management software, java viewer and user's guide are freely available.
