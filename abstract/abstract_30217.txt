BACKGROUND
interstitial lung disease  is frequently associated with collagen
diseases. the prognosis of acute-onset diffuse ild  occurring in
collagen disease patients is very poor. here, we investigated serum
biomarker profiles of aodild to find markers predicting outcome in patients
with collagen diseases.

methods
a solid-phase antibody array was used for screening  <dig> biomarkers in pooled
sera from collagen disease patients in the aodild state and in the stable
state. biomarkers in individual sera were detected without pooling by
bead-based immunoassay.


RESULTS
the serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase - <dig>  tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase - <dig>  osteopontin, interleukin - <dig> receptor α
, and il- <dig> receptor antagonist were significantly increased in
aodild, but timp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and eotaxin  <dig> levels were decreased. the mmp- <dig> to
mmp- <dig> ratio was reduced in aodild state. this tendency was also observed in
ra patients with aodild. moreover, serum il- <dig> level was significantly
increased in the aodild state in patients with acute exacerbation of ild
. serum timp- <dig> and il-2rα levels were significantly increased
in the aodild state in patients with drug-induced ild , whereas
timp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and eotaxin  <dig> levels were decreased. the mmp- <dig> to mmp- <dig> ratio
was reduced in aodild state in patients with di-ild. the serum timp- <dig> 
mmp- <dig>  osteopontin, il-2rα, mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig> levels were significantly
increased in the aodild state in patients who subsequently died, whereas
timp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> levels were decreased in those who survived. the mmp- <dig> to
mmp- <dig> ratio was reduced in aodild state in patients who died, but not in
those who survived.


CONCLUSIONS
serum biomarker profiles could represent prognosis markers for aodild in
collagen diseases.
