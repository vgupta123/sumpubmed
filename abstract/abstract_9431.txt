BACKGROUND
the gamma-gliadins are considered to be the oldest of the gliadin family of storage proteins in aegilops/triticum. however, the expansion of this multigene family has not been studied in an evolutionary perspective.


RESULTS
we have cloned  <dig> gamma-gliadin genes from aegilops and triticum species  representing eight different genomes: am, b/s, c, d, m, n, t and u. overall, 15% of the sequences contained internal stop codons resulting in pseudogenes, but this percentage was variable among genomes, up to over 50% in ae. umbellulata. the most common length of the deduced protein, including the signal peptide, was  <dig> amino acids, but the length varied from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, both obtained from ae. speltoides. most genes encoded proteins with eight cysteines. however, all aegilops species had genes that encoded a gamma-gliadin protein of  <dig> amino acids with an additional cysteine. these conserved nine-cysteine gamma-gliadins may perform a specific function, possibly as chain terminators in gluten network formation in protein bodies during endosperm development. a phylogenetic analysis of gamma-gliadins derived from aegilops and triticum species and the related genera lophopyrum, crithopsis, and dasypyrum showed six groups of genes. most aegilops species contained gamma-gliadin genes from several of these groups, which also included sequences from the genera lophopyrum, crithopsis, and dasypyrum. hordein and secalin sequences formed separate groups.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a model for the evolution of the gamma-gliadins from which we deduce that the most recent common ancestor  of aegilops/triticum-dasypyrum-lophopyrum-crithopsis already had four groups of gamma-gliadin sequences, presumably the result of two rounds of duplication of the locus.
