BACKGROUND
u <dig> snorna is a box c/d small nucleolar rna  involved in the processing events that liberate 18s rrna from the ribosomal rna precursor . although u <dig> snorna is present in all eukaryotic organisms, most investigations of it have focused on fungi , animals and plants. relatively little is known about u <dig> snorna and its gene in the phylogenetically broad assemblage of protists . in the euglenozoon euglena gracilis, a distant relative of the kinetoplastid protozoa, southern analysis had previously revealed at least  <dig> bands hybridizing with u <dig> snorna, suggesting the existence of multiple copies of u <dig> snorna genes.


RESULTS
through screening of a Î» genomic library and pcr amplification, we recovered  <dig> u <dig> snorna gene variants, defined by sequence heterogeneities that are mostly located in the u <dig> 3'-stem-loop domain. we identified three different genomic arrangements of euglena u <dig> snorna genes: i) stand-alone, ii) linked to trnaarg genes, and iii) linked to a u <dig> snrna gene. in arrangement ii), the u <dig> snorna gene is positioned upstream of two identical trnaarg genes that are convergently transcribed relative to the u <dig> gene. this scenario is reminiscent of a u <dig> snorna-trna gene linkage previously described in trypanosomatids. we document here twelve different u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene arrangements in euglena; in each case, the u <dig> gene is linked to a downstream and convergently oriented u <dig> gene, with the intergenic region differing in length and sequence among the variants.


CONCLUSIONS
the multiple u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages, which cluster into distinct families based on sequence similarities within the intergenic spacer, presumably arose by genome, chromosome, and/or locus duplications. we discuss possible reasons for the existence of the unusually large number of u <dig> snorna genes in the euglena genome. variability in the signal intensities of the multiple southern hybridization bands raises the possibility that euglena contains a naturally aneuploid chromosome complement.
