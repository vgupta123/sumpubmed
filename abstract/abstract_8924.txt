BACKGROUND
c- <dig>  produced by streptomyces globisporus c- <dig>  is one of the most potent antitumoral agents. the biosynthetic gene cluster of c- <dig>  previously cloned and sequenced, contains at least three putative regulatory genes, i.e. sgcr <dig>  sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig>  the predicted gene products of these genes share sequence similarities to strr, regulators of arac/xyls family and tylr. the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of sgcr <dig> in c- <dig> biosynthesis.


RESULTS
overexpression of sgcr <dig> in s. globisporus c- <dig> resulted in a 30â€“40% increase in c- <dig> production. consistent with this, disruption of sgcr <dig> abolished c- <dig> production. complementation of the sgcr3-disrupted strain r3ko with intact sgcr <dig> gene could restore c- <dig> production. the results from real time rt-pcr analysis in r3ko mutant and wild type strain indicated that not only transcripts of biosynthetic structural genes such as sgca <dig> and sgcc <dig>  but also putative regulatory genes, sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig>  were significantly decreased in r3ko mutant. the cross-complementation studies showed that sgcr1r <dig> could functionally complement sgcr <dig> disruption in trans. purified n-terminal his10-tagged sgcr <dig> showed specific dna-binding activity to the promoter region of sgcr1r <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the role of sgcr <dig> has been proved to be a positive regulator of c- <dig> biosynthesis in s. globisporus c- <dig>  sgcr <dig> occupies a higher level than sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> in the regulatory hierarchy that controls c- <dig> production and activates the transcription of sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> by binding directly to the promoter region of sgcr1r <dig>
