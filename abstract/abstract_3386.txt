BACKGROUND
archaeosomes , vesicles prepared from total polar lipids  extracted from selected genera and species from the archaea domain, elicit both antibody and cell-mediated immunity to the entrapped antigen, as well as efficient cross priming of exogenous antigens, evoking a profound memory response. screening for unexplored archaea genus as new sources of adjuvancy, here we report the presence of two new halorubrum tebenquichense strains isolated from grey crystals  and black mood  strata from a littoral argentinean patagonia salt flat. cytotoxicity, intracellular transit and immune response induced by two subcutaneous  administrations  with bsa entrapped in arc made of tpl either form bm  and from gc  at 2% w/w , to c3h/hen mice  and boosted on day  <dig> with  <dig> μg of bare bsa, were determined.


RESULTS
dna g+c content , 16s rdna sequentiation, dna-dna hybridization, arbitrarily primed fingerprint assay and biochemical data confirmed that bm and gc isolates were two non-previously described strains of h. tebenquichense. both multilamellar arc mean size were  <dig> ±  <dig> nm, with - <dig> mv zeta-potential, and were not cytotoxic on vero cells up to  <dig> mg/ml and up to  <dig>  mg/ml of lipids on j- <dig> macrophages . arc inner aqueous content remained inside the phago-lysosomal system of j- <dig> cells beyond the first incubation hour at 37°c, as revealed by pyranine loaded in arc. upon subcutaneous immunization of c3h/hen mice, bsa entrapped in arc-bm or arc-gc elicited a strong and sustained primary antibody response, as well as improved specific humoral immunity after boosting with the bare antigen. both igg <dig> and igg2a enhanced antibody titers could be demonstrated in long-term  recall suggesting induction of a mixed th1/th <dig> response.


CONCLUSIONS
we herein report the finding of new h. tebenquichense non alkaliphilic strains in argentinean patagonia together with the adjuvant properties of arc after sc administration in mice. our results indicate that archaeosomes prepared with tpl from these two strains could be successfully used as vaccine delivery vehicles.
