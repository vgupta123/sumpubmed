BACKGROUND
anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate reduction  prevents more than 90% of the oceanic methane emission to the atmosphere. in a previous study, we demonstrated that the high methane pressure  stimulated in vitro sr-aom activity. however, the information on the effect of high-pressure on the microbial community structure and architecture was still lacking.


RESULTS
in this study we analysed the long-term enrichment  of this microbial community, which was mediating sr-aom in a continuous high-pressure bioreactor.  <dig> % of the total biovolume represented cells in the form of small aggregates . an increase of the total biovolume was observed . after  <dig> days, the anme- <dig>  and srb  increased with a factor  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper reports a net biomass growth of communities involved in sr-aom, incubated at high-pressure.
