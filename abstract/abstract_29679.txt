BACKGROUND
outer membrane vesicles  are released from the outer membrane of many gram-negative bacteria. these extracellular compartments are known to transport compounds involved in cell-cell signalling as well as virulence associated proteins, e.g. the cytolysine from enterotoxic e. coli.


RESULTS
we have demonstrated that xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris  releases omvs into the culture supernatant during growth. a proteome study identified  <dig> different proteins that associate with the omv fraction of which half are virulence-associated. a comparison with the most abundant outer membrane  proteins revealed that some proteins are enriched in the omv fraction. this may be connected to differences in the lps composition between the omvs and the om. furthermore, a comparison of the omv proteomes from two different culture media indicated that the culture conditions have an impact on the protein composition. interestingly, the proteins that are common to both culture conditions are mainly involved in virulence.


CONCLUSIONS
outer membrane vesicles released from the om of xcc contain membrane- and virulence-associated proteins. future experiments will prove whether these structures can serve as "vehicles" for the transport of virulence factors into the host membrane.
