BACKGROUND
the composition and expression of vertebrate gene families is shaped by species specific gene loss in combination with a number of gene and genome duplication events  and depends on the ecological and evolutionary context. in this study we analyzed the evolutionary history of the solute carrier  <dig>  gene family. these genes are supposed to be under strong selective pressure  due to their important role in the timely removal of glutamate at the synapse.


RESULTS
in a genomic survey where we manually annotated and analyzing sequences from more than  <dig> slc <dig> genes , we found evidence for an interesting evolutionary history of this gene family. while human and mouse genomes contain  <dig> slc <dig> genes, in prototheria, sauropsida, and amphibia genomes up to  <dig> and in actinopterygii up to  <dig> slc <dig> genes are present. while some of the additional slc <dig> genes in ray-finned fishes originated from r <dig>  the increased number of slc <dig> genes in prototheria, sauropsida, and amphibia genomes originates from specific genes retained in these lineages.

phylogenetic comparison and microsynteny analyses of the slc <dig> genes indicate, that theria genomes evidently lost several slc <dig> genes still present in the other lineage. the genes lost in theria group into two new subfamilies of the slc <dig> gene family which we named slc1a8/eaat <dig> and slc1a9/eaat <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the phylogeny of the slc1/eaat gene family demonstrates how multiple genome reorganization and duplication events can influence the number of active genes. inactivation and preservation of specific slc <dig> genes led to the complete loss of two subfamilies in extant theria, while other vertebrates have retained at least one member of two newly identified slc <dig> subfamilies.
