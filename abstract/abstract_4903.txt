BACKGROUND
among the three functions of dna, mammalian replication and transcription can be subject to epigenetic imprinting specified by the parental origin of chromosomes, and although there is suggestive indication that this is also true for meiotic recombination, no definitive evidence has yet been reported.


RESULTS
we have now obtained such evidence on mouse chromosome  <dig> by assaying meiotic recombination as it occurs in reciprocal f <dig> mice. a  <dig> kb region near the kcnq <dig> transcriptionally imprinted domain showed significantly higher recombination activity in the cast√ób <dig> parental direction . characterizing hotspots within this domain revealed a cluster of three hotspots lying within a  <dig> kb span, among these hotspots, slc22a <dig> showed a definitive parent of origin effect on recombination frequency . comparing recombination activity in the mouse kcnq <dig> and neighboring h19-igf <dig> imprinted domains with their human counterparts, we found that elevated recombination activity in these domains is a consequence of their chromosomal position relative to the telomere and not an intrinsic characteristic of transcriptionally imprinted domains as has been previously suggested.


CONCLUSIONS
similar to replication and transcription, we demonstrate that meiotic recombination can be subjected to epigenetic imprinting and hotspot activity can be influenced by the parental origin of chromosomes. furthermore, transcriptionally imprinted regions exhibiting elevated recombination activity are likely a consequence of their chromosomal location rather than their transcriptional characteristic.
