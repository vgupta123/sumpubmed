BACKGROUND
doubled haploid production is a key technology in triticale research and breeding. a critical component of this method depends on chromosome doubling, which is traditionally achieved by in vivo treatment of seedlings with colchicine.


RESULTS
in this study we investigated the applicability of an in vitro approach for chromosome doubling based on microspore culture. our results show a pronounced increase in the proportion of doubled haploid triticale plants compared to the spontaneous doubling rate, but also compared to the doubling obtained by the standard in vivo approach. in addition, the frequency of plants surviving from culture medium to maturity is also much higher for the in vitro approach. colchicine concentrations of 1 mm for 24 h or  <dig>  mm applied for  <dig> or 72 h during the first hours of microspore culture performed best.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that for triticale, in vitro chromosome doubling is a promising alternative to the in vivo approach.
