BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing technologies allow to obtain at low cost the genomic sequence information that currently lacks for most economically and ecologically important organisms. for the mallard duck genomic data is limited. the mallard is, besides a species of large agricultural and societal importance, also the focal species when it comes to long distance dispersal of avian influenza. for large scale identification of snps we performed illumina sequencing of wild mallard dna and compared our data with ongoing genome and est sequencing of domesticated conspecifics. this is the first study of its kind for waterfowl.


RESULTS
more than one billion base pairs of sequence information were generated resulting in a 16Ã— coverage of a reduced representation library of the mallard genome. sequence reads were aligned to a draft domesticated duck reference genome and allowed for the detection of over  <dig>  snps within our mallard sequence dataset. in addition, almost  <dig>  nucleotide positions on the domesticated duck reference showed a different nucleotide compared to wild mallard. approximately  <dig>  snps identified within our data were shared with snps identified in the sequenced domestic duck or in est sequencing projects. the shared snps were considered to be highly reliable and were used to benchmark non-shared snps for quality. genotyping of a representative sample of  <dig> snps resulted in a snp conversion rate of  <dig> %. the correlation of the minor allele count and observed minor allele frequency in the snp discovery pool was  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we identified almost  <dig>  snps in wild mallards that will likely yield good results in genotyping. of these, ~ <dig>  snps were detected within our wild mallard sequences and ~ <dig>  were detected between wild and domesticated duck data. in the ~ <dig>  snps we found a subset of ~ <dig>  snps shared between wild mallards and the sequenced domesticated duck suggesting a low genetic divergence. comparison of quality metrics between the total snp set  and the validated subset shows similar characteristics for both sets. this indicates that we have detected a large amount  of accurately inferred mallard snps, which will benefit bird evolutionary studies, ecological studies  and industrial breeding programs.
