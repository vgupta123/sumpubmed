BACKGROUND
worldwide, but especially in developing countries, coenurosis of sheep and other livestock is caused by taenia multiceps larvae, and zoonotic infections occur in humans. infections frequently lead to host death, resulting in huge socioeconomic losses. micrornas  have important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of a large number of animal genes by imperfectly binding target mrnas. to date, there have been no reports of mirnas in t. multiceps.


RESULTS
in this study, we obtained  <dig>  million high quality raw reads from adult t. multiceps small rna library using illumina sequencing technology. a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families  from  <dig>  unique mirnas were characterized using mirbase . here, we selected three conserved mirna/mirna*  duplexes at random and amplified their corresponding precursors using a pcr-based method. furthermore,  <dig> candidate novel mirna precursors were verified by genomic pcr. among these, six corresponding t. multiceps mirnas are considered specific for taeniidae because no homologs were found in other species annotated in mirbase. in addition,  <dig>  target sites within t. multiceps transcriptome were predicted for  <dig> candidate newly mirnas.


CONCLUSIONS
our large-scale investigation of mirnas in adult t. multiceps provides a substantial platform for improving our understanding of the molecular regulation of t. multiceps and other cestodes development.
