BACKGROUND
formins are multidomain proteins defined by a conserved fh <dig>  domain with actin nucleation activity preceded by a proline-rich fh <dig>  domain. formins act as profilin-modulated processive actin nucleators conserved throughout a wide range of eukaryotes.


RESULTS
we present a detailed sequence analysis of the  <dig> formins  identified in the genome of the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum. with the exception of fori and forc all other formins conform to the domain structure gbd/fh3-fh1-fh2-dad, where dad is the diaphanous autoinhibition domain and gbd/fh <dig> is the rho gtpase-binding domain/formin homology  <dig> domain that we propose to represent a single domain. forc lacks a fh <dig> domain, fori lacks recognizable gbd/fh <dig> and dad domains and fora, e and j have additional unique domains. to establish the relationship between formins of dictyostelium and other organisms we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of fh <dig> domains. real-time pcr was used to study the expression pattern of formin genes. expression of forc, d, i and j increased during transition to multi-cellular stages, while the rest of genes displayed less marked developmental variations. during sexual development, expression of forh and fori displayed a significant increase in fusion competent cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis allows some preliminary insight into the functionality of dictyostelium formins: all isoforms might display actin nucleation activity and, with the exception of fori, might also be susceptible to autoinhibition and to regulation by rho gtpases. the architecture gbd/fh3-fh1-fh2-dad appears common to almost all dictyostelium, fungal and metazoan formins, for which we propose the denomination of conventional formins, and implies a common regulatory mechanism.
