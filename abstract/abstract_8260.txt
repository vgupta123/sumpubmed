BACKGROUND
the parvulin-type peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase par <dig> is highly conserved in all metazoans. the recently identified parvulin par <dig> contains an additional n-terminal domain whose occurrence and function was the focus of the present study.


RESULTS
based on the observation that the human genome encodes par <dig>  but bovine and rodent genomes do not, par <dig> exon sequences from  <dig> different primate species were cloned and sequenced. par <dig> is encoded in the genomes of hominidae species including humans, but is absent from other mammalian species. in contrast to par <dig>  endogenous par <dig> was found in mitochondrial and membrane fractions of human cell lysates. fluorescence of egfp fusions of par <dig>  but not par <dig>  co-localized with mitochondrial staining. par <dig> and par <dig> associated with isolated human, rat and yeast mitochondria at low salt concentrations, but only the par <dig> mitochondrial association was resistant to higher salt concentrations. par <dig> was imported into mitochondria in a time and membrane potential-dependent manner, where it reached the mitochondrial matrix. moreover, par <dig> was shown to bind to double-stranded dna under physiological salt conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the dna binding parvulin par <dig> is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by the most recently evolved mitochondrial prepeptide known to date, thus adding a novel protein constituent to the mitochondrial proteome of hominidae.
