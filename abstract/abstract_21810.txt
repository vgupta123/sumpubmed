BACKGROUND
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  have emerged as pathogens that can cause food-borne infections and severe and potentially fatal illnesses in humans, such as haemorrhagic colitis  and haemolytic uraemic syndrome . in spain, like in many other countries, stec strains have been frequently isolated from ruminants, and represent a significant cause of sporadic cases of human infection. in view of the lack of data on stec isolated from food in spain, the objectives of this study were to determine the level of microbiological contamination and the prevalence of stec o157:h <dig> and non-o <dig> in a large sampling of minced beef collected from  <dig> local stores in lugo city between  <dig> and  <dig>  also to establish if those stec isolated from food possessed the same virulence profiles as stec strains causing human infections.


RESULTS
stec were detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> minced beef samples tested. stec o157:h <dig> was isolated from eight  samples and non-o <dig> stec from  <dig>  samples. ninety-six stec isolates were further characterized by pcr and serotyping. pcr showed that  <dig>  isolates carried stx <dig> genes,  <dig>  possessed stx <dig> genes, and  <dig>  both stx <dig> and stx <dig>  enterohemolysin  and intimin  virulence genes were detected in  <dig>  and in  <dig>  of the isolates, respectively. typing of the eae variants detected four types: γ <dig> , β <dig> , ε <dig> , and θ . the majority  of stec isolates belonged to serotypes previously detected in human stec and 38% to serotypes associated with stec isolated from patients with hus. ten new serotypes not previously described in raw beef products were also detected. the highly virulent seropathotypes o26:h <dig> stx <dig> eae-β <dig>  o157:h <dig> stx1stx <dig> eae-γ <dig> and o157:h <dig> stx2eae-γ <dig>  which are the most frequently observed among stec causing human infections in spain, were detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> stec isolates. furthermore, phage typing of stec o157:h <dig> isolates showed that the majority  belonged to the main phage types previously detected in stec o157:h <dig> strains associated with severe human illnesses.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study do not differ greatly from those reported in other countries with regard to prevalence of o <dig> and non-o <dig> stec in minced beef. as we suspected, serotypes different from o157:h <dig> also play an important role in food contamination in spain, including the highly virulent seropathotype o26:h <dig> stx <dig> eae-β <dig>  thus, our data confirm minced beef in the city of lugo as vehicles of highly pathogenic stec. this requires that control measures to be introduced and implemented to increase the safety of minced beef.
