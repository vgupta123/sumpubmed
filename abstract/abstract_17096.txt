BACKGROUND
the human papillomavirus  e <dig> protein is a multifunctional dna-binding protein. the transcriptional activity of hpv e <dig> is mediated by binding to its specific binding sites in the upstream regulatory region of the hpv genomes. previously we reported a hpv- <dig> variant from a verrucae vulgaris patient with huge extensive clustered cutaneous, which have five point mutations in its e <dig> orf, l118s, s235p, y287h, s293r and a338v. under the control of hpv- <dig> lcr, co-expression of the mutated hpv e <dig> induced an increased activity on the viral early promoter. in the present study, a series of mammalian expression plasmids encoding e <dig> proteins with one to five amino acid  substitutions for these mutations were constructed and transfected into hela, c33a and siha cells.


RESULTS
cat expression assays indicated that the enhanced promoter activity was due to the co-expressions of the e <dig> constructs containing a338v mutation within the dna-binding domain. western blots analysis demonstrated that the transiently transfected e <dig> expressing plasmids, regardless of prototype or the a338v mutant, were continuously expressed in the cells. to study the effect of e <dig> mutations on its dna-binding activity, a serial of recombinant e <dig> proteins with various lengths were expressed and purified. electrophoresis mobility shift assays  showed that the binding affinity of e <dig> protein with a338v mutation to both an artificial probe with two e <dig> binding sites or hpv- <dig> and hpv- <dig> promoter-proximal lcr sequences were significantly stronger than that of the hpv- <dig> prototype e <dig>  furthermore, co-expression of the construct containing a338v mutant exhibited increased activities on heterologous hpv- <dig> early promoter p <dig> than that of prototype e <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the mutation from ala to val at aa  <dig> is critical for e <dig> dna-binding and its transcriptional regulation.
