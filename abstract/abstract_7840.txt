BACKGROUND
diverse mechanisms  have been reported for staphylococcus aureus strains with intermediate vancomycin susceptibility . this study was conducted to identify common mechanisms responsible for decreased vancomycin susceptibility in a visa strain pair.


RESULTS
transcriptional profiling of the clinical heterogeneous visa isolate sa137/93a and its spontaneous homogeneous mutant strain sa137/93g pointed to an increased capsule production in the strain pair compared to a susceptible control. furthermore, transcript quantification of the gene cap5e, which is essential for capsule biosynthesis, revealed elevated levels in the visa strains sa137/93a, sa137/93g and mu <dig> in comparison with susceptible strains reynolds, newman and sa1450/ <dig>  the increased expression was observed in bacteria from exponential as well as stationary growth phase. however, suppression of type  <dig> capsule formation by expression of antisense rna did not increase vancomycin susceptibility in the visa strain sa137/93g. likewise, construction of inducible mutants of s. aureus newman or repair of capsule biosynthesis of s. aureus hg <dig> and s. aureus 1450/ <dig> did not influence resistance to vancomycin. furthermore, purified type  <dig> polysaccharide did not protect indicator strains from the action of vancomycin.


CONCLUSIONS
the visa strain tested in this study displayed an increased production of type  <dig> capsular polysaccharide. however, the production of capsule material did not protect strain sa137/93g and three vancomycin sensitive strains in the presence of vancomycin and thus is not part of the resistance mechanism; however it may represent a by-product of visa life style that is often characterized by a high sigma factor b activity.
