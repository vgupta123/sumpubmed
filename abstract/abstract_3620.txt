BACKGROUND
the human homologue of the drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein, hdlg, is a multi-domain cytoplasmic protein that localizes to the membrane at intercellular junction sites. at both synaptic junctions and epithelia cell-cell junctions, hdlg is known to recruit several signaling proteins into macromolecular complexes. hdlg is also found at the midbody, a small microtubule-rich structure bridging the two daughter cells during cytokinesis, but its function at this site is not clear.


RESULTS
here we describe the interaction of hdlg with the activated form of mek <dig> of the canonical raf/mek/erk pathway, a protein that is found at the midbody during cytokinesis. we show that both proteins localize to a sub-structure of the midbody, the midbody ring, and that the interaction between the pdz domains of hdlg and the c-terminal portion of mek <dig> is dependent on the phosphorylation of mek <dig>  finally, we found that e-cadherin also localizes to the midbody and that its expression is required for the isoform-specific recruitment of hdlg, but not activated mek <dig>  to that structure.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that like at other cell-cell junction sites, hdlg is part of a macromolecular complex of structural and signaling proteins at the midbody.
