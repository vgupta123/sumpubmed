BACKGROUND
in a previous study, we conducted a large-scale similarity-free function prediction of mitochondrion-encoded hypothetical proteins, by which the hypothetical gene murf <dig>  was assigned as nad <dig>  encoding subunit  <dig> of nadh dehydrogenase . this hypothetical gene occurs in the mitochondrial genome of kinetoplastids, a group of unicellular eukaryotes including the causative agents of african sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis. in the present study, we test this assignment by using bioinformatics methods that are highly sensitive in identifying remote homologs and confront the prediction with available biological knowledge.


RESULTS
comparison of murf <dig> profile hidden markov model  against function-known profile hmms in pfam, panther and tigr shows that murf <dig> is a complex i protein, but without specifying the exact subunit. therefore, we constructed profile hmms for each individual subunit, using all available sequences clustered at various identity thresholds. hmm-hmm comparison of these individual nadh subunits against murf <dig> clearly identifies this hypothetical protein as nad <dig>  further, we collected the relevant experimental information about kinetoplastids, which provides additional evidence in support of this prediction.


CONCLUSIONS
our in silico analyses provide convincing evidence for murf <dig> being a highly divergent member of nad <dig>
