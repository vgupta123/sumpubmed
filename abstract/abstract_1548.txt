BACKGROUND
oxidative stress  is an important factor in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. certain neurons in different brain regions exhibit selective vulnerability to os. currently little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this selective neuronal vulnerability. the purpose of this study was to identify endogenous factors that predispose vulnerable neurons to os by employing genomic and biochemical approaches.


RESULTS
in this report, using in vitro neuronal cultures, ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures and acute brain slice preparations, we established that cerebellar granule  and hippocampal ca <dig> neurons were significantly more sensitive to os  than cerebral cortical and hippocampal ca <dig> neurons. to probe for intrinsic differences between in vivo vulnerable  and resistant  neurons under basal conditions, these neurons were collected by laser capture microdissection from freshly excised brain sections , and then subjected to oligonucleotide microarray analysis. genechip-based transcriptomic analyses revealed that vulnerable neurons had higher expression of genes related to stress and immune response, and lower expression of energy generation and signal transduction genes in comparison with resistant neurons. subsequent targeted biochemical analyses confirmed the lower energy levels  in primary cbg neurons compared with cortical neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
low energy reserves and high intrinsic stress levels are two underlying factors for neuronal selective vulnerability to os. these mechanisms can be targeted in the future for the protection of vulnerable neurons.
