BACKGROUND
genetically encoded sensors developed on the basis of green fluorescent protein -like proteins are becoming more and more popular instruments for monitoring cellular analytes and enzyme activities in living cells and transgenic organisms. in particular, a number of ca2+ sensors have been developed, either based on fret  changes between two gfp-mutants or on the change in fluorescence intensity of a single circularly permuted fluorescent protein .


RESULTS
here we report significant progress on the development of the latter type of ca2+ sensors. derived from the knowledge of previously reported cpfp-based sensors, we generated a set of cpfp-based indicators with different spectral properties and fluorescent responses to changes in ca2+ concentration. two variants, named case <dig> and case <dig>  were characterized by particular high brightness and superior dynamic range, up to 12-fold and  <dig> -fold increase in green fluorescence between ca2+-free and ca2+-saturated forms. we demonstrated the high potential of these sensors on various examples, including monitoring of ca2+ response to a prolonged glutamate treatment in cortical neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
we believe that expanded dynamic range, high brightness and relatively high ph-stability should make case <dig> and case <dig> popular research tools both in scientific studies and high throughput screening assays.
