BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  is a primary mechanism of functional regulation in the human genome, with 60% to 80% of human genes being alternatively spliced. as part of the bovine genome annotation team, we have analysed  <dig> bovine as genes, compared to  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse as genes, along with gene ontology  analysis. we also analysed the two most important events, cassette exons and intron retention in  <dig> human disease genes and mapped them to the bovine orthologous genes. of the  <dig> human inherited disease genes, a protein domain analysis was carried out for the transcript sequences of  <dig> human genes that have orthologous genes and have been characterised in cow.


RESULTS
of the  <dig>  bovine genes,  <dig>  genes  are alternatively spliced, compared to  <dig>   in human and  <dig>   in mouse. gene-level analysis of the orthologous set suggested that bovine genes show fewer as events compared to human and mouse genes. a detailed examination of cassette exons across human and cow for  <dig> human disease genes, suggested that a majority of cassette exons in human were present and constitutive in bovine as opposed to intron retention which exhibited 50% of the exons as present and 50% as absent in cow. we observed that as plays a major role in disease implications in human through manipulations of essential/functional protein domains. it was also evident that majority of these  <dig> genes had conservation of all essential domains in their bovine orthologous counterpart, for these human diseases.


CONCLUSIONS
while alternative splicing has the potential to create many mrna isoforms from a single gene, in cow the majority of genes generate two to three isoforms, compared to six in human and four in mouse. our analyses demonstrated that a smaller number of bovine genes show greater transcript diversity. go definitions for bovine as genes provided 38% more functional information than currently available in the sequence database. our protein domain analysis helped us verify the suitability of using bovine as a model for human diseases and also recognize the contribution of as towards the disease phenotypes.
