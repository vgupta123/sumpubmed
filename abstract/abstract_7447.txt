BACKGROUND
disabled- <dig>  is an adaptor protein that is essential for the intracellular transduction of reelin signaling, which regulates the migration and differentiation of postmitotic neurons during brain development in vertebrates. dab <dig> function depends on its tyrosine phosphorylation by src family kinases, especially fyn.


RESULTS
we have isolated alternatively spliced forms of porcine dab <dig> from brain  and liver  and fyn from brain  and spleen . radiation hybrid mapping localized porcine dab <dig>  and fyn  to chromosomes 6q31- <dig> and 1p <dig>  respectively. real-time quantitative rt-pcr  demonstrated that different isoforms of dab <dig> and fyn have tissue-specific expression patterns, and sdab <dig> and sfyn-b display similar temporal expression characteristics in the developing porcine cerebral cortex and cerebellum. both sdab <dig> isoforms function as nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. it was further shown that sfyn phosphorylates sdab <dig> at tyrosyl residues   <dig>  198/ <dig> and  <dig>  whereas sdab1-li was phosphorylated at tyr  <dig> and tyr  <dig>  in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
alternative splicing generates natural sdab1-li that only carries y <dig> and y <dig>  sites, which can be phosphorylated by fyn in vitro. sdab1-li is an isoform that is highly expressed in peripheral organs. both isoforms are suggested to be nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. our results imply that the short splice form sdab1-li might regulate cellular responses to different cell signals by acting as a dominant negative form against the full length sdab <dig> variant and that both isoforms might serve different signaling functions in different tissues.
