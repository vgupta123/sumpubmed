BACKGROUND
stress acclimation is an effective mechanism that plants acquired for adaption to dynamic environment. even though generally considered to be sensitive to low temperature, cassava, a major tropical crop, can be tolerant to much lower temperature after chilling acclimation. improvement to chilling resistance could be beneficial to breeding. however, the underlying mechanism and the effects of chilling acclimation on chilling tolerance remain largely unexplored.


RESULTS
in order to understand the mechanism of chilling acclimation, we profiled and analyzed the transcriptome and micrornaome of cassava, using high-throughput deep sequencing, across the normal condition, a moderate chilling stress , a harsh stress  after chilling acclimation , and a chilling shock from 24°c to 4°c. the results revealed that moderate stress and chilling shock triggered comparable degrees of transcriptional perturbation, and more importantly, about two thirds of differentially expressed genes reversed their expression from up-regulation to down-regulation or vice versa in response to hash stress after experiencing moderate stress. in addition, micrornas played important roles in the process of this massive genetic circuitry rewiring. furthermore, function analysis revealed that chilling acclimation helped the plant develop immunity to further harsh stress by exclusively inducing genes with function for nutrient reservation therefore providing protection, whereas chilling shock induced genes with function for viral reproduction therefore causing damage.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed, for the first time, the molecular basis of chilling acclimation, and showed potential regulation role of microrna in chilling response and acclimation in euphorbia.
