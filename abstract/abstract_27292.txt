BACKGROUND
regulatory t cells  are required for proper maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. folate receptor  <dig>  is expressed at high levels in transforming growth factor-beta -induced tregs and natural tregs. moreover, antibody-mediated targeting of fr <dig> is sufficient to mediate treg depletion.


RESULTS
in this study, we describe a novel fr <dig> transcript variant, fr4d <dig>  in which exon  <dig> is deleted. the mrna of fr4d <dig> encodes a fr <dig> variant truncated by  <dig> bp. fr4d <dig> was found to be predominantly expressed in cd4+cd25+ treg cells. overexpression of fr4d <dig> in cd4+cd25+ treg cells in vitro stimulated proliferation, which may modulate the ability of these cells to bind and incorporate folic acid.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggested that high levels of fr4d <dig> may be critical to support the substantial proliferative capacity of treg cells.
