BACKGROUND
the incapacity of articular cartilage  for self-repair after damage ultimately leads to the development of osteoarthritis. stem cell-based therapy has been proposed for the treatment of osteoarthritis  and induced pluripotent stem cells  are becoming a promising stem cell source.


RESULTS
three steps were developed to differentiate human ipscs into chondrocytes which were transplanted into rat oa models induced by monosodium iodoacetate . after 6 days embryonic body  formation and 2 weeks differentiation, the gene and protein expression of col2a <dig>  gag and sox <dig> has significantly increased compare to undifferentiated hipscs. after 15 weeks transplantation, no immune responses were observed, micro-ct showed gradual engraftment and the improvement of subchondrol plate integrity, and histological examinations demonstrated articular cartilage matrix production.


CONCLUSIONS
hipsc could be an efficient and clinically translatable approach for cartilage tissue regeneration in oa cartilages.
