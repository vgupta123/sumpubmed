BACKGROUND
manchurochelys manchoukuoensis is an emblematic turtle from the cretaceous yixian formation of liaoning, china, a geological rock unit that is famous for yielding perfectly preserved skeletons of fossil vertebrates, including that of feathered dinosaurs. manchurochelys manchoukuoensis was one of the first vertebrates described from this fauna, also known as the jehol biota. the holotype was lost during world war ii and only one additional specimen has been described since. manchurochelys manchoukuoensis is a critical taxon for unraveling the phylogenetic relationships of cretaceous pancryptodires from asia, a group that is considered to be of key importance for the origin of crown-group hidden-neck turtles .


RESULTS
a new specimen of manchurochelys manchoukuoensis is described here from the jiufotang formation of qilinshan, chifeng, inner mongolia, china. this is the third specimen described and expands the range of this taxon from the yixian formation of the fuxin-yixian basin in liaoning to the jiufotang formation of the chifeng-yuanbaoshan basin. a possible temporal extension of the range is less certain. the new finding adds to our understanding of the morphology of this taxon and invites a thorough revision of the phylogeny of macrobaenidae, sinemydidae, and closely allied forms.


CONCLUSIONS
our comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of cretaceous asian pancryptodires yielded two main competing hypotheses: in the first these taxa form a paraphyletic grade, whereas in the second they form a monophyletic clade. the inclusion of problematic tree changing taxa, such as panpleurodires  has a major influence on the phylogenetic relationships of sinemydidae and closely allied forms. manchurochelys manchoukuoensis nests within sinemydidae together with sinemys spp. and dracochelys bicuspis in the majority of our analyses.
