BACKGROUND
bordetella bronchiseptica is a bacterial respiratory pathogen that infects a broad range of mammals, causing chronic and often subclinical infections. gene expression in bordetella is regulated by a two-component sensory transduction system, bvgas, which controls the expression of a spectrum of phenotypic phases transitioning between a virulent  phase and a non-virulent  phase.


RESULTS
based on the genomic sequence and using the freely available software arrayoligoselector, a long oligonucleotide b. bronchiseptica microarray was designed and assembled. this long-oligonucleotide microarray was subsequently tested and validated by comparing changes in the global expression profiles between b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> and its bvg- phase-locked derivative, rb <dig>  data from this microarray analysis revealed  <dig>  bvg-regulated genes, which greatly expands the bvgas regulon defined in previous reports. for previously reported bvg-regulated transcripts, the gene expression data presented here is congruent with prior findings. additionally, quantitative real-time pcr data provided an independent verification of the microarray expression values.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here provide a comprehensive, genome-wide portrait of transcripts encompassing the bvgas regulon, while also providing data validating the long-oligonucleotide microarray described here for studying gene expression in bordetella bronchiseptica.
