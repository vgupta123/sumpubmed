BACKGROUND
in the composition of an event the verb's argument structure defines the number of participants and their relationships. previous studies indicated distinct brain responses depending on how many obligatory arguments a verb takes. the present functional magnetic resonance imaging  study served to verify the neural structures involved in the processing of german verbs with one  or three  argument structure. within a silent reading design, verbs were presented either in isolation or with a minimal syntactic context .


RESULTS
reading of isolated one-argument verbs  produced stronger bold responses than three-argument verbs  in the inferior temporal fusiform gyrus  of the left hemisphere, validating previous magnetoencephalographic findings. when presented in context one-argument verbs  induced more pronounced activity in the inferior frontal gyrus  of the left hemisphere than three-argument verbs .


CONCLUSIONS
in line with previous studies our results corroborate the left temporal lobe as site of representation and the ifg as site of processing of verbs' argument structure.
