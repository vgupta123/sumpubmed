BACKGROUND
interactions between mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  and free-living protozoa in water are likely to occur in nature. the potential impact of ingestion of map by two naturally occurring acanthamoeba spp. on this pathogen's survival and chlorine resistance was investigated.


RESULTS
between  <dig>  and  <dig> % of spiked populations of three map strains , which had been added at a multiplicity of infection of 10: <dig>  were ingested by acanthamoeba castellanii ccap 1501/1b and a. polyphaga ccap 1501/3b during co-culture for  <dig> h at 25°c. map cells were observed to be present within the vacuoles of the amoebae by acid-fast staining. during extended co-culture of map nctc  <dig> at 25°c for  <dig> d with both a. castellanii and a. polyphaga map numbers did not change significantly during the first  <dig> days of incubation, however a 1– <dig>  log <dig> increase in map numbers was observed between days  <dig> and  <dig> within both acanthamoeba spp. ingested map cells were shown to be more resistant to chlorine inactivation than free map. exposure to  <dig> μg/ml chlorine for  <dig> min resulted in a log <dig> reduction of  <dig>  in ingested map but a log <dig> reduction of  <dig>  in free map .


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that ingestion of map by and survival and multiplication of map within acanthamoeba spp. is possible, and that map cells ingested by amoebae are more resistant to inactivation by chlorine than free map cells. these findings have implications with respect to the efficacy of chlorination applied to map infected surface waters.
