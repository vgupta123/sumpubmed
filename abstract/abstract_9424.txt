BACKGROUND
the expression of metallothionein  is involved in acquiring resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis; it is also a negative regulator of the immune response. nasal polyps are typified by a resistance to immune-mediated apoptosis as well as by excessive immune cell infiltration. rcas <dig>  is a membrane protein capable of inducing the apoptosis of ctls and nk cells. the aim of the present study has been to explore the expression of metallothionein with respect to immune cell presence and immune cell activity. in our study, we identified immune cells using cd <dig> and cd <dig> antigen expression and evaluated their activity using cd <dig> antigen expression. we then analyzed metallothionein, rcas <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> in a sampling of  <dig> nasal polyps using the immunohistochemistry method. we were able to divide the nasal polyps into three main groups according to their predominant immune cell infiltration: eosinophilic nasal polyps , lymphocytic nasal polyps , and neutrophilic nasal polyps .


RESULTS
in the present study, statistically significant differences between the mt expression in the epithelium and that in the stroma of the nasal polyps along with the accompanying alterations in activation markers on immune cells were found and the number of macrophages in both the eosinophilic and the lymphocytic nasal polyps was assessed. rcas1-expressing macrophages were found only in the eosinophilic nasal polyps.


CONCLUSIONS
mt expression seems to favor the survival of nasal polyp epithelial cells in the adjacent area of increasingly cytotoxic immune activity. rcas1-expressing macrophages seem to participate in creating the immune suppressive microenvironment and so help to sustain local inflammation.
