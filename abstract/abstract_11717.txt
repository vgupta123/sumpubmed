BACKGROUND
sec18p/n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  is a conserved eukaryotic atpase, which primarily functions in vesicle membrane fusion from yeast to human. however, the function of the ossec <dig> gene, a homologue of nsf in rice, remains unknown.


RESULTS
in the present study, we investigated the function of ossec <dig> in rice and found that ossec <dig> complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype and interferes with vacuolar morphogenesis in yeast. overexpression of ossec <dig> in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight and altered the morphology of the protein bodies. further examination revealed that ossec <dig> presented as a 290-kda complex in rice endosperm cells. moreover, os60sp <dig> was identified a component of this complex, demonstrating that the ossec <dig> complex contains another complex of p <dig> in rice endosperm cells. furthermore, we determined that the n-terminus of ossec <dig> can interact with the n- and c-termini of os60sp <dig>  whereas the c-terminus of ossec <dig> can only interact with the c-terminus of os60sp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed that the ossec <dig> regulates vacuolar morphology in both yeast and rice endosperm cell and the ossec <dig> interacts with p <dig> complex in rice endosperm cell.
