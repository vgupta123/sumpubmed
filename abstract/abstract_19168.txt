BACKGROUND
dystroglycan  is a transmembrane protein that is a part of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex  which connects the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. the c-terminal end of dg contains a number of putative sh <dig>  sh <dig> and ww domain binding sites. the most c-terminal ppxy motif has been established as a binding site for dystrophin  ww-domain. however, our previous studies indicate that both dystroglycan ppxy motives, wwbsi and wwbsii can bind dystrophin protein in vitro.


RESULTS
we now find that both ww binding sites are important for maintaining full dg function in the establishment of oocyte polarity in drosophila. if either ww binding site is mutated, the dg protein can still be active. however, simultaneous mutations in both ww binding sites abolish the dg activities in both overexpression and loss-of-function oocyte polarity assays in vivo. additionally, sequence comparisons of ww binding sites in  <dig> species of drosophila, as well as in humans, reveal a high level of conservation. this preservation throughout evolution supports the idea that both ww binding sites are functionally required.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the obtained results we propose that the presence of the two ww binding sites in dystroglycan secures the essential interaction between dg and dys and might further provide additional regulation for the cytoskeletal interactions of this complex.
