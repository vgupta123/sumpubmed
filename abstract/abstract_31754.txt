BACKGROUND
insect metamorphosis relies on temporal and spatial cues that are precisely controlled. previous studies in drosophila have shown that untimely activation of genes that are essential to metamorphosis results in growth defects, developmental delay and death. multiple factors exist that safeguard these genes against dysregulated expression. the list of identified negative regulators that play such a role in drosophila development continues to expand.


RESULTS
by using rnai transgene-induced gene silencing coupled to spatio/temporal assessment, we have unraveled an important role for the drosophila dopamine 1-like receptor, dop1r <dig>  in development. we show that dop1r <dig> knockdown leads to pre-adult lethality. in adults that escape death, abnormal wing expansion and/or melanization defects occur. furthermore we show that salivary gland expression of this gpcr during the late larval/prepupal stage is essential for the flies to survive through adulthood. in addition to rnai-induced effects, treatment of larvae with the high affinity d1-like receptor antagonist flupenthixol, also results in developmental arrest, and in morphological defects comparable to those seen in dop1r <dig> rnai flies. to examine the basis for pupal lethality in dop1r <dig> rnai flies, we carried out transcriptome analysis. these studies revealed up-regulation of genes that respond to ecdysone, regulate morphogenesis and/or modulate defense/immunity.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together our findings suggest a role for dop1r <dig> in the repression of genes that coordinate metamorphosis. premature release of this inhibition is not tolerated by the developing fly.
