BACKGROUND
the hawaiian honeycreepers  are one of the best-known examples of an adaptive radiation, but their persistence today is threatened by the introduction of exotic pathogens and their vector, the mosquito culex quinquefasciatus. historically, species such as the amakihi , the apapane , and the iiwi  were found from the coastal lowlands to the high elevation forests, but by the late 1800's they had become extremely rare in habitats below  <dig> m. recently, however, populations of amakihi and apapane have been observed in low elevation habitats. we used twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate patterns of genetic structure, and to infer responses of these species to introduced avian malaria along an elevational gradient on the eastern flanks of mauna loa and kilauea volcanoes on the island of hawaii.


RESULTS
our results indicate that amakihi have genetically distinct, spatially structured populations that correspond with altitude. we detected very few apapane and no iiwi in low-elevation habitats, and genetic results reveal only minimal differentiation between populations at different altitudes in either of these species.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that amakihi populations in low elevation habitats have not been recolonized by individuals from mid or high elevation refuges. after generations of strong selection for pathogen resistance, these populations have rebounded and amakihi have become common in regions in which they were previously rare or absent.
