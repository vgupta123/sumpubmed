BACKGROUND
regulating synthesis of the fragile x gene  product, fmrp alters neural plasticity potentially through its role in the microrna pathway. cap-dependent translation of the fmr <dig> mrna, a process requiring ribosomal scanning through the 5' leader, is likely impeded by the extensive secondary structure generated by the high guanosine/cytosine nucleotide content including the cgg triplet nucleotide repeats in the 5' leader. an alternative mechanism to initiate translation â€“ internal initiation often utilizes secondary structure to recruit the translational machinery. consequently, studies were undertaken to confirm and extend a previous observation that the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains an internal ribosomal entry site .


RESULTS
cellular transfection of a dicistronic dna construct containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader inserted into the intercistronic region yielded significant translation of the second cistron, but the fmr <dig> 5' leader was also found to contain a cryptic promoter possibly confounding interpretation of these results. however, transfection of dicistronic and monocistronic rna ex vivo or in vitro confirmed that the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains an ires. moreover, inhibiting cap-dependent translation ex vivo did not affect the expression level of endogenous fmrp indicating a role for ires-dependent translation of fmr <dig> mrna. analysis of the fmr <dig> 5' leader revealed that the cgg repeats and the 5' end of the leader were vital for internal initiation. functionally, exposure to potassium chloride or intracellular acidification and addition of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid as mimics of neural activity and double stranded rna, respectively, differentially affected fmr <dig> ires activity.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that multiple stimuli influence ires-dependent translation of the fmr <dig> mrna and suggest a functional role for the cgg nucleotide repeats.
