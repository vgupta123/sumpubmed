BACKGROUND
micrornas  are expressed by a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, and function in diverse biological processes. numerous mirnas have been identified in bombyx mori, but the temporal expression profiles of mirnas corresponding to each stage transition over the entire life cycle of the silkworm remain to be established. to obtain a comprehensive overview of the correlation between mirna expression and stage transitions, we performed a whole-life test and subsequent stage-by-stage examinations on nearly one hundred mirnas in the silkworm.


RESULTS
our results show that mirnas display a wide variety of expression profiles over the whole life of the silkworm, including continuous expression from embryo to adult , up-regulation over the entire life cycle , down-regulation over the entire life cycle , expression associated with embryogenesis , up-regulation from early 3rd instar to pupa , and complementary pulses in expression between mir-34b and mir- <dig>  stage-by-stage examinations revealed further expression patterns, such as emergence at specific time-points during embryogenesis and up-regulation of mirna groups in late embryos , expression associated with stage transition between instar and molt larval stages , expression associated with silk gland growth and spinning activity , continuous high expression from the spinning larval to pupal and adult stages , a coordinate expression trough in day  <dig> pupae of both sexes , up-regulation in pupal metamorphosis of both sexes , and down-regulation in pupal metamorphosis of both sexes .


CONCLUSIONS
we present the full-scale expression profiles of mirnas throughout the life cycle of bombyx mori. the whole-life expression profile was further investigated via stage-by-stage analysis. our data provide an important resource for more detailed functional analysis of mirnas in this animal.
