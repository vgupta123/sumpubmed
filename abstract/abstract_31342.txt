RESULTS
non-infected mice immunized with rv2190c dna or ag85a dna showed higher levels of interferon-gamma  in stimulated spleen lymphocyte culture supernatants, and had more th <dig> cells and an elevatory ratio of th1/th <dig> immune cells in whole blood, indicating that th1-type immune response was predominant. compared with the saline group, ag85a dna group and rv2190c dna group in the infected mice decreased the lung colony-forming units  by  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig>  and spleen cfus by  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> respectively, and pathological lesion.
