BACKGROUND
although transposable element  derived dna accounts for more than half of mammalian genomes and initiates a significant proportion of rna transcripts, high throughput methods are rarely leveraged specifically to detect expression from interspersed repeats.


RESULTS
to characterize the contribution of transposons to mammalian transcriptomes, we developed a custom microarray platform with probes covering known human and mouse transposons in both sense and antisense orientations. we termed this platform the “te-array” and profiled te repeat expression in a panel of normal mouse tissues. validation with nanostring® and rnaseq technologies demonstrated that te-array is an effective method. our data show that te transcription occurs preferentially from the sense strand and is regulated in highly tissue-specific patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transposon rnas frequently originate within genomic te units and do not primarily accumulate as a consequence of random ‘read-through’ from gene promoters. moreover, we find te expression is highly dependent on the tissue context. this suggests that te expression may be related to tissue-specific chromatin states or cellular phenotypes. we anticipate that te-array will provide a scalable method to characterize transposable element rnas.
