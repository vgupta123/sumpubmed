BACKGROUND
sperm adhesion molecule  <dig>  is the major mammalian testicular hyaluronidase and is expressed at high levels in sperm cells. spam <dig> protein is important for penetration of the cumulus cell layer surrounding the ovum, and is also involved in zona pellucida binding and sperm intracellular signalling. a previous study had identified spam <dig> as one of the many human genes that initiate within a transposable element.


RESULTS
examination of the human, mouse and rat spam <dig> loci revealed that transcripts initiate within the pol gene of an endogenous retrovirus  element. this is highly unusual, as all previously identified erv-initiated cellular gene transcripts initiate within the viral long terminal repeat promoter. the spam <dig> locus therefore represents an example of the evolution of a promoter from protein-coding sequence. we have identified novel alternative promoter and splicing variants of human and murine spam <dig>  we show that all transcript variants are expressed primarily in the testis and are predicted to encode identical proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
the testis-specific promoters of the human and mouse spam <dig> genes are derived from sequence that was originally part of an erv pol gene. this represents the first known example of an erv-derived promoter acting in a gender-specific manner.
