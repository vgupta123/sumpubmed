BACKGROUND
heat shock proteins  are ubiquitously synthesised in virtually all species and it is hypothesised that they might have beneficial health effects. recent studies have identified circulating hsp as an important mediator in inflammation - the effects of low-grade inflammation in the aging process are overwhelming. while much is known about intracellular hsp <dig>  scant data exist on circulating hsp <dig> in the aging context. therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of age and disease on circulating hsp <dig> and, in particular, to evaluate the association between circulating hsp <dig> and inflammatory parameters.


RESULTS
serum hsp <dig>  interleukin  - <dig>  il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor  alpha concentrations were determined in  <dig> hospitalised geriatric patients  and in  <dig> community-dwelling control subjects . in the community-dwelling elderly, serum hsp <dig> and il- <dig> concentrations were significantly lower and il- <dig> was significantly higher when compared to healthy young control subjects. elderly patients presenting inflammation  showed significantly  higher hsp <dig> values; and hsp <dig> correlated positively  with il- <dig> and crp, but not with tnf-alpha or il- <dig>  a significant association was also noted between hsp <dig> levels and the degree of dependency and cognitive decline in geriatric patients.


CONCLUSIONS
the present data provide new evidence that serum concentration of hsp <dig> decreases with age in a normal population. our study also shows that higher levels of hsp <dig> are associated with inflammation and frailty in elderly patients.
