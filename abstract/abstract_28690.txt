BACKGROUND
meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes provides natural combinations of genetic variations and is a main driving force of evolution. it is initiated via programmed dna double-strand breaks  and involves a specific axial chromosomal structure. so far, recombination regions have been mainly determined by experiments, both expensive and time-consuming.


RESULTS
spore is a mathematical model that describes the non-uniform localisation of dsb and axis proteins sites, and distinguishes high versus low protein density. it is based on a combination of genomic signals, based on what is known from wet-lab experiments, whose contribution is precisely quantified. it models axis proteins accumulation at gene 5’-ends with a discrete approximation of their diffusion and convection along genes. it models dsb accumulation at approximated gene promoter positions with intergenic region length and gc-content. spore can be used for prediction and it is parameterised in an obvious way that makes it easy to understand from a biological viewpoint.


CONCLUSIONS
when compared to saccharomyces cerevisiae experimental data, spore predicts axis protein and dsb positions with high sensitivity and precision, axis protein density with an average local correlation r= <dig>  and dsb density with an average local correlation r= <dig> . spore outbreaks previous dsb predictors, which are based on nucleotide patterning, and it reaches 85% of success rate in dsb prediction compared to 54% obtained by available tools on a benchmarked dataset.
