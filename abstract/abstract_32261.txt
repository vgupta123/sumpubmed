BACKGROUND
the incidence of reported cases of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy  caused by infection with neuropathogenic strains of equine herpesvirus  <dig>  has markedly increased over the last decade in many western countries. the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of the neuropathogenic  and non-neuropathogenic  variants of ehv- <dig> among isolates associated with abortions in polish stud farms.


RESULTS
the results of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism  and sequencing were consistent, and showed that two out of  <dig> abortions  were induced by the neuropathogenic genotype g <dig>  all remaining  <dig> ehv- <dig> positive abortion cases  were caused by the non-neuropathogenic genotype a <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
most of the abortions in mares in poland from  <dig> to  <dig> were associated with non-neuropathogenic strains of ehv- <dig>  however, the presented data indicate that the neuropathogenic genotype of the virus is also present in polish stud farms. such a presence suggests that the future emergence of ehm in poland is probable.
