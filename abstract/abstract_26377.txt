BACKGROUND
one of the major tasks of the post-genomic era is "reading" genomic sequences in order to extract all the biological information contained in them. although a wide variety of techniques is used to solve the gene finding problem and a number of prokaryotic gene-finding software are available, gene recognition in bacteria is far from being always straightforward.


RESULTS
this study reported a thorough search for new cds in the two published xcc genomes. in the first, putative cdss encoded in the two genomes were re-predicted using three gene finders, resulting in the identification of  <dig> putative new cdss. in the second, similarity searching was conducted and  <dig> cdss were found to have homologs in other bacterial species. in the third, oligonucleotide microarray and rt-pcr analysis identified  <dig> cdss with detectable mrna transcripts. finally, in-frame deletion and subsequent phenotype analysis of confirmed that xcc_cds <dig> encoding a novel sir2-like domain protein is involved in virulence and xcc_cds <dig> encoding a arsr family transcription factor is involved in arsenate resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
despite sophisticated approaches available for genome annotation, many cellular transcripts have remained unidentified so far in xcc genomes. through a combined strategy involving bioinformatic, postgenomic and genetic approaches, a reliable list of  <dig> new cdss was identified and a more thorough understanding of some cellular processes was gained.
