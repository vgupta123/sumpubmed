BACKGROUND
epilepsy is genetically complex neurological disorder affecting millions of people of different age groups varying in its type and severity. copy number variants  are key players in the genetic etiology of numerous neurodevelopmental disorders and prior findings also revealed that chromosomal aberrations are more susceptible against the pathogenesis of epilepsy. novel technologies, such as array comparative genomic hybridization , may help to uncover the pathogenic cnvs in patients with epilepsy.


RESULTS
this study was carried out by high density whole genome array-cgh analysis with blood dna samples from a cohort of  <dig> epilepsy patients to search for cnvs associated with epilepsy. pathogenic rearrangements which include 6p <dig>  microduplications in  <dig> patients covering a total region of  <dig> kb and 7q <dig>  microdeletions in  <dig> patients covering a total region of  <dig> kb were detected. two genes bmp <dig> and podxl were located in the predicted duplicated and deleted regions respectively. furthermore, these cnv findings were confirmed by qpcr.


CONCLUSIONS
we have described, for the first time, several novel cnvs/genes implicated in epilepsy in the saudi population. these findings enable us to better describe the genetic variations in epilepsy, and could provide a foundation for understanding the critical regions of the genome which might be involved in the development of epilepsy.
