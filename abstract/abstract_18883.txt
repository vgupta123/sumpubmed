BACKGROUND
a two-year longitudinal study composed of morphometric mri measures and cognitive behavioral evaluation was performed on a transgenic huntingtonâ€™s disease  monkey. rhd <dig>  a transgenic hd monkey expressing exon  <dig> of the human gene encoding huntingtin  with  <dig> cag repeats regulated by a human polyubiquitin c promoter was used together with four age-matched wild-type control monkeys. this is the first study on a primate model of human hd based on longitudinal clinical measurements.


RESULTS
changes in striatal and hippocampal volumes in rhd <dig> were observed with progressive impairment in motor functions and cognitive decline, including deficits in learning stimulus-reward associations, recognition memory and spatial memory. the results demonstrate a progressive cognitive decline and morphometric changes in the striatum and hippocampus in a transgenic hd monkey.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study on a primate model of human hd based on longitudinal clinical measurements. while this study is based a single hd monkey, an ongoing longitudinal study with additional hd monkeys will be important for the confirmation of our findings. a nonhuman primate model of hd could complement other animal models of hd to better understand the pathogenesis of hd and future development of diagnostics and therapeutics through longitudinal assessment.
