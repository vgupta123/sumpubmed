BACKGROUND
hainan island is located around the conjunction of east asia and southeast asia, and during the last glacial maximum  was connected with the mainland. this provided an opportunity for the colonization of hainan island by modern human in the upper pleistocene. whether the ancient dispersal left any footprints in the contemporary gene pool of hainan islanders is debatable.


RESULTS
we collected samples from  <dig> li individuals and analyzed mitochondrial dna  variations of hypervariable sequence i and ii , as well as partial coding regions. by incorporating previously reported data, the phylogeny of hainan islanders was reconstructed. we found that hainan islanders showed a close relationship with the populations in mainland southern china, especially from guangxi. haplotype sharing analyses suggested that the recent gene flow from the mainland might play important roles in shaping the maternal pool of hainan islanders. more importantly, haplogroups m <dig>  m7e, and m7c1* might represent the genetic relics of the ancient population that populated this region; thus,  <dig> representative complete mtdna genomes were further sequenced.


CONCLUSIONS
the detailed phylogeographic analyses of haplogroups m <dig>  m7e, and m7c1* indicated that the early peopling of hainan island by modern human could be traced back to the early holocene and/or even the late upper pleistocene, around  <dig> -  <dig> kya. these results correspond to both y-chromosome and archaeological studies.
