BACKGROUND
a population of satellite cells exists in skeletal muscle. these cells are thought to be primarily responsible for postnatal muscle growth and injury-induced muscle regeneration. the janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription  signaling cascade has a crucial role in regulating myogenesis. in rodent skeletal muscle, stat <dig> is essential for satellite cell migration and myogenic differentiation, regulating the expression of myogenic factors. the aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the expression profile of jak/stat family members, using cultured primary human skeletal muscle cells.


RESULTS
near confluent proliferating myoblasts were induced to differentiate for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days. during these developmental stages, members of the jak/stat family were examined, along with factors known to regulate myogenesis. we demonstrate the phosphorylation of jak <dig> and stat <dig> only during myoblast proliferation, while jak <dig> and stat <dig> phosphorylation increases during differentiation. these increases were correlated with the upregulation of genes associated with muscle maturation and hypertrophy.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results provide insight into jak/stat signaling in human skeletal muscle development, and confirm recent observations in rodents.
