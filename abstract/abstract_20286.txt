BACKGROUND
co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus- <dig>  and hepatitis c virus  is associated with faster progression of liver disease and an increase in hcv persistence. however, the mechanism by which hiv- <dig> accelerates the progression of hcv liver disease remains unknown.


RESULTS
hiv-1/hcv co-infection is associated with increased expression of interferon gamma-induced protein- <dig>  mrna in peripheral blood mononuclear cells . hcv rna levels were higher in pbmcs of patients with hiv-1/hcv co-infection than in patients with hcv mono-infection. hiv- <dig> tat and ip- <dig> activated hcv replication in a time-dependent manner, and hiv- <dig> tat induced ip- <dig> production. in addition, the effect of hiv- <dig> tat on hcv replication was blocked by anti-ip- <dig> monoclonal antibody, demonstrating that the effect of hiv- <dig> tat on hcv replication depends on ip- <dig>  taken together, these results suggest that hiv- <dig> tat protein activates hcv replication by upregulating ip- <dig> production.


CONCLUSIONS
hiv-1/hcv co-infection is associated with increased expression of ip- <dig> mrna and replication of hcv rna. furthermore, both hiv- <dig> tat and ip- <dig> activate hcv replication. hiv- <dig> tat activates hcv replication by upregulating ip- <dig> production. these results expand our understanding of hiv- <dig> in hcv replication and the mechanism involved in the regulation of hcv replication mediated by hiv- <dig> during co-infection.
