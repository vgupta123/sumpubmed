BACKGROUND
p <dig>  a p <dig> family member is a transcription factor that plays a role in cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. p <dig> is regulated through post translational modifications and protein interactions. c-abl is the only known tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and activates p <dig>  here we have analyzed the role of src family kinases, which are involved in diverse signaling pathways, in regulating p <dig> 


RESULTS
exogenously expressed as well as cellular hck and p <dig> interact in vivo. in vitro binding assays show that sh <dig> domain of hck interacts with p <dig>  co-expression of p <dig> with hck or c-src in mammalian cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p <dig>  using site directed mutational analysis, we determined that tyr- <dig> was the major site of phosphorylation by hck and c-src, unlike c-abl which phosphorylates tyr- <dig>  in a kinase dependent manner, hck co-expression resulted in stabilization of p <dig> protein in the cytoplasm. activation of hck in hl- <dig> cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous p <dig>  both exogenous and endogenous hck localize to the nuclear as well as cytoplasmic compartment, just as does p <dig>  ectopically expressed hck repressed the transcriptional activity of p <dig> as determined by promoter assays and semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of the p <dig> target, ipaf and mdm <dig>  sh <dig> domain- dependent function of hck was required for its effect on p <dig> activity, which was also reflected in its ability to inhibit p73-mediated apoptosis. we also show that hck interacts with yes associated protein , a transcriptional co-activator of p <dig>  and shrna mediated knockdown of yap protein reduces p <dig> induced ipaf promoter activation.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified p <dig> as a novel substrate and interacting partner of hck and show that it regulates p <dig> through mechanisms that are dependent on either catalytic activity or protein interaction domains. hck-sh <dig> domain-mediated interactions play an important role in the inhibition of p73-dependent transcriptional activation of a target gene, ipaf, as well as apoptosis.
