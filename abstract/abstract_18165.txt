BACKGROUND
high-density linkage maps facilitate the mapping of target genes and the construction of partial linkage maps around target loci to develop markers for marker-assisted selection . mas is quite challenging in conifers because of their large, complex, and poorly-characterized genomes. our goal was to construct a high-density linkage map to facilitate the identification of markers that are tightly linked to a major recessive male-sterile gene  for mas in c. japonica, a species that is important in japanese afforestation but which causes serious social pollinosis problems.


RESULTS
we constructed a high-density saturated genetic linkage map for c. japonica using expressed sequence-derived co-dominant single nucleotide polymorphism  markers, most of which were genotyped using the goldengate genotyping assay. a total of  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> linkage groups with an observed map length of  <dig>  cm and a mean distance between two adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm; the number of linkage groups matched the basic chromosome number in c. japonica. using this map, we located ms <dig> on the 9th linkage group and constructed a partial linkage map around the ms <dig> locus. this enabled us to identify a marker  that is closely linked to the ms <dig> gene, being separated from it by only  <dig>  cm.


CONCLUSIONS
using the high-density map, we located the ms <dig> gene on the 9th linkage group and constructed a partial linkage map around the ms <dig> locus. the map distance between the ms <dig> gene and the tightly linked marker was only  <dig>  cm. the identification of markers that are tightly linked to the ms <dig> gene will facilitate the early selection of male-sterile trees, which should expedite c. japonica breeding programs aimed at alleviating pollinosis problems without harming productivity.
