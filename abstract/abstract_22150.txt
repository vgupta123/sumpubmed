BACKGROUND
research in the field of systems biology requires software for a variety of purposes. software must be used to store, retrieve, analyze, and sometimes even to collect the data obtained from system-level  experiments. software must also be used to implement mathematical models and algorithms required for simulation and theoretical predictions on the system-level.


RESULTS
we introduce a free, easy-to-use, open-source, integrated software platform called the systems biology research tool  to facilitate the computational aspects of systems biology. the sbrt currently performs  <dig> methods for analyzing stoichiometric networks and  <dig> methods from fields such as graph theory, geometry, algebra, and combinatorics. new computational techniques can be added to the sbrt via process plug-ins, providing a high degree of evolvability and a unifying framework for software development in systems biology.


CONCLUSIONS
the systems biology research tool represents a technological advance for systems biology. this software can be used to make sophisticated computational techniques accessible to everyone , to facilitate cooperation among researchers, and to expedite progress in the field of systems biology.
