BACKGROUND
a key step in the analysis of microarray expression profiling data is the identification of genes that display statistically significant changes in expression signals between two biological conditions.


RESULTS
we describe a new method, rank difference analysis of microarrays , which estimates the total number of truly varying genes and assigns a p-value to each signal variation. information on a group of differentially expressed genes includes the sensitivity and the false discovery rate. we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach by applying it to a large synthetic expression data set and to a biological data set obtained by comparing vegetatively-growing wild type and tor2-mutant yeast strains. in both cases we observed a significant improvement of the power of analysis when our method is compared to another popular nonparametric method.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provided a valuable new statistical method to analyze microarray data. we conclude that the good quality of the results obtained by rdam is mainly due to the quasi-perfect equalization of variation distribution, which is related to the standardization procedure used and to the measurement of variation by rank difference.
