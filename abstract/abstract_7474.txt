BACKGROUND
biochemical models predict that photosynthesis in c <dig> plants is most frequently limited by the slower of two processes, the maximum capacity of the enzyme rubisco to carboxylate rubp , or the regeneration of rubp via electron transport . at current atmospheric  levels rubisco is not saturated; consequently, elevating  increases the velocity of carboxylation and inhibits the competing oxygenation reaction which is also catalyzed by rubisco. in the future, leaf photosynthesis  should be increasingly limited by rubp regeneration, as  is predicted to exceed  <dig> ppm by  <dig>  the c <dig> cycle enzyme sedoheptulose- <dig>  bisphosphatase  has been shown to exert strong metabolic control over rubp regeneration at light saturation.


RESULTS
we tested the hypothesis that tobacco transformed to overexpressing sbpase will exhibit greater stimulation of a than wild type  tobacco when grown under field conditions at elevated   under fully open air fumigation. growth under elevated  stimulated instantaneous a and the diurnal photosynthetic integral  more in transformants than wt. there was evidence of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated  via downregulation of vc,max in both wt and transformants. nevertheless, greater carbon assimilation and electron transport rates  for transformants led to greater yield increases than wt at elevated  compared to ambient grown plants.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide proof of concept that increasing content and activity of a single photosynthesis enzyme can enhance carbon assimilation and yield of c <dig> crops grown at  expected by the middle of the 21st century.
