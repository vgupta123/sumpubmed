BACKGROUND
in general, sugar porters function by proton-coupled symport or facilitative transport modes. symporters, coupled to electrochemical energy, transport nutrients against a substrate gradient. facilitative carriers transport sugars along a concentration gradient, thus transport is dependent upon extracellular nutrient levels. across bacteria, fungi, unicellular non-vertebrates and plants, proton-coupled hexose symport is a crucial process supplying energy under conditions of nutrient flux. in mammals it has been assumed that evolution of whole body regulatory mechanisms would eliminate this need. to determine whether any isoforms bearing this function might be conserved in mammals, we investigated the relationship between the transporters of animals and the proton-coupled hexose symporters found in other species.


RESULTS
we took a comparative genomic approach and have performed the first comprehensive and statistically supported phylogenetic analysis of all mammalian glucose transporter  isoforms. our data reveals the mammalian glut proteins segregate into five distinct classes. this evolutionary ancestry gives insight to structure, function and transport mechanisms within the groups. combined with biological assays, we present novel evidence that, in response to changing nutrient availability and environmental ph, proton-coupled, active glucose symport function is maintained in mammalian cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the analyses show the ancestry, evolutionary conservation and biological importance of the glut classes. these findings significantly extend our understanding of the evolution of mammalian glucose transport systems. they also reveal that mammals may have conserved an adaptive response to nutrient demand that would have important physiological implications to cell survival and growth.
