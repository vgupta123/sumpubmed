BACKGROUND
glycosphingolipids  are integral components of mammalian cell membranes that are involved in cell adhesion and cell signaling processes. gsl are subdivided into structural series, like ganglio-, lacto/neolacto-, globo- and isoglo-series, which are defined by distinct trisaccharide cores. the β <dig>  n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-v  enzyme catalyzes the formation of the lc <dig> structure, which is the core of lactoseries derived gsl.


RESULTS
the biological significance of the glycoconjugates produced by the b3gnt <dig> enzyme was investigated by inactivating the b3gnt <dig> gene in the mouse germline. the disruption of the b3gnt <dig> protein-coding region in mouse embryonic stem cells resulted in reduced lc3-synthase activity, supporting its specific contribution to lactoseries derived gsl synthesis. breeding of heterozygous mutant mice failed to produce any viable progeny homozygous for the b3gnt5-null allele. the genotypic examination of embryos from heterozygous crosses showed that the disruption of the b3gnt <dig> gene leads to pre-implantation lethality. this finding was compatible with the expression pattern of the b3gnt <dig> gene in the pre-implantation embryo as shown by in situ hybridization. the analysis of gsl profiles in embryonic stem cells heterozygous for the b3gnt5-null allele confirmed the reduced levels of lactoseries derived gsl levels and of other gsl species.


CONCLUSIONS
the disruption of the b3gnt <dig> gene in mice affected the expression of lactoseries derived gls and possibly of protein-bound β3glcnac-linked glycans, thereby demonstrating an essential contribution of these glycoconjugates in early embryonic development, and supporting the importance of these glycoconjugates in cell differentiation and adhesion processes.
