BACKGROUND
previous work showed that weaning stress causes gut barrier dysfunction partly by triggering the release of corticotropin releasing factor  and thereby inducing the degranulation of intestinal mast cell . this study investigated the hypothesis that attenuating the weaning-induced activation of the crf-mc axis via administration of a mc stabilizing agent  may improve gut permeability and piglet performance after weaning.


RESULTS
to test the hypothesis twenty piglets were weaned  and injected intraperitoneally with saline  or 20 mg/kg bw of sodium cromolyn  at –  <dig> ,  <dig> and 16 h relative to weaning. piglets were housed individually and fed ad libitum a pre-starter diet from one to  <dig> d post-weaning followed by a starter diet until the end of the study on d  <dig>  cromolyn improved intestinal permeability as indicated by the reduced recovery of cobalt and mannitol in plasma samples. cromolyn treated pigs consumed more feed , gained more bw , and grew more efficiently  than their control counterparts. as a result, cromolyn treated pigs were  <dig>  kg heavier than those in the control group by d  <dig> after weaning .


CONCLUSIONS
in agreement with our hypothesis, present data indicate that the cromolyn-mediated improvement of intestinal permeability is associated with enhanced pig performance after weaning.
