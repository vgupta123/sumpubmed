BACKGROUND
female fertility is important for the maintenance of the production in a dairy cattle herd. two qtl regions on bta <dig> and on bta <dig> previously detected in nordic holstein  and validated in the danish jersey  and nordic red  were investigated further in the present study to further refine the qtl locations. refined qtl regions were imputed to the full sequence data. the genes in the regions were then studied to ascertain their possible effect on fertility traits.


RESULTS
bta <dig> was screened for number of inseminations , 56-day non-return rate , days from first to last insemination , and the interval from calving to first insemination  in the range of  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> bp, whereas bta <dig> was screened for icf only in the range from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> with the hd bovine snp array for nh, dj and nr. no markers in the dj and nr breeds reached significance. by analyzing imputed sequence data the qtl position on bta <dig> was narrowed down to two regions in the nh. in these two regions a total of  <dig> genes were identified. bta <dig> was analyzed using sequence data for the nh breed. the highest –log <dig> was  <dig>  at  <dig> , <dig> bp. two regions were identified: region 1:  <dig> ,143- <dig> , <dig> bp and region 2:  <dig> ,815- <dig> , <dig> bp. snps within and between these two regions were annotated as intergenic.


CONCLUSIONS
screening bta <dig> and bta <dig> for female fertility traits in nh, nr and dj suggested that the qtl for female fertility were specific for nh. a missense mutation in cd <dig> showed the strongest association with fertility traits on bta <dig>  the annotated snps on bta <dig> were all intergenic variants. it is possible that bta <dig> at this stage is poorly annotated such that the associated polymorphisms are located in as-yet undiscovered genes. fertility traits are complex traits as many different biological and physiological factors determine whether a cow is fertile. therefore it is not expected that there is a simple explanation with an obvious candidate gene but it is more likely a network of genes and intragenic variants that explain the variation of these traits.
