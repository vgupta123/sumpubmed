BACKGROUND
the orderly progression through mitosis is regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex , a large multiprotein e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that targets key cell-cycle regulators for destruction by the  <dig> s proteasome. the apc is composed of at least  <dig> subunits and associates with additional regulatory activators during mitosis and interphase cycles. despite extensive research on apc and activator functions in the cell cycle, only a few components have been functionally characterized in plants.


RESULTS
here, we describe an in-depth search for apc subunits and activator genes in the arabidopsis, rice and poplar genomes. also, searches in other genomes that are not completely sequenced were performed. phylogenetic analyses indicate that some apc subunits and activator genes have experienced gene duplication events in plants, in contrast to animals. expression patterns of paralog subunits and activators in rice could indicate that this duplication, rather than complete redundancy, could reflect initial specialization steps. the absence of subunit apc <dig> from the genome of some green algae species and as well as from early metazoan lineages, could mean that apc <dig> is not required for apc function in unicellular organisms and it may be a result of duplication of another tetratricopeptide  subunit. analyses of tpr evolution suggest that duplications of subunits started from the central domains.


CONCLUSIONS
the increased complexity of the apc gene structure, tied to the diversification of expression paths, suggests that land plants developed sophisticated mechanisms of apc regulation to cope with the sedentary life style and its associated environmental exposures.
