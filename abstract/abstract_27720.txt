BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and zoonotic agent that mainly causes septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis. it has recently been suggested that proteinases produced by s. suis  are potential virulence determinants. in the present study, we screened a s. suis mutant library created by the insertion of tn <dig> transposon in order to isolate a mutant deficient in a cell surface proteinase. we characterized the gene and assessed the proteinase for its potential as a virulence factor.


RESULTS
two mutants  possessing a single tn <dig> insertion were isolated. the affected gene coded for a protein  that shared a high degree of identity with streptococccus thermophilus prts  and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus agalactiae cspa , which are cell surface serine proteinases. the ssu <dig> protein had a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and contained the catalytic triad characteristic of subtilisin family proteinases: motif i , motif ii , and motif iii . ssu <dig> also had the gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif  at the carboxy-terminus, which was followed by a hydrophobic domain. all the s. suis isolates tested, which belonged to different serotypes, possessed the gene encoding the ssu <dig> protein. the two mutants devoid of subtilisin-like proteinase activity had longer generation times and were more susceptible to killing by whole blood than the wild-type parent strain p1/ <dig>  the virulence of the g6g and m3g mutants was compared to the wild-type strain in the cd <dig> mouse model. significant differences in mortality rates were noted between the p1/ <dig> group and the m3g and g6g groups .


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified a gene coding for a cell surface subtilisin-like serine proteinase that is widely distributed in s. suis. evidences were brought for the involvement of this proteinase in s. suis virulence.
