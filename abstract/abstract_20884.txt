BACKGROUND
preconception allergen immunization prevents neonatal allergen sensitization in mice by a complex interaction between regulatory cells/factors and antibodies. the present study assessed the influence of maternal immunization with ovalbumin  on the immune response of  <dig> day-old and  <dig> week-old offspring immunized or non-immunized with ova and evaluated the effect of igg treatment during fetal development or neonatal period.


RESULTS
maternal immunization with ova showed increased levels of fcγriib expression in splenic b cells of neonates, which were maintained for up to  <dig> weeks and not affected by additional postnatal ova immunization. maternal immunization also exerted a down-modulatory effect on both il- <dig> and ifn-γ-secreting t cells and il- <dig> and il-12- secreting b cells. furthermore, immunized neonates from immunized mothers showed a marked inhibition of antigen-specifc ige ab production and lowered th2/th <dig> cytokine levels, whereas displaying enhanced fcγriib expression on b cells. these offspring also showed reduced antigen-specific proliferative response and lowered b cell responsiveness. moreover, in vitro evaluation revealed an impairment of b cell activation upon engagement of b cell antigen receptor by igg from ova-immunized mice. finally, in vivo igg transference during pregnancy or breastfeeding revealed that maternal ab transference was able to increase regulatory cytokines, such as il- <dig>  in the prenatal stage; yet only the postnatal treatment prevented neonatal sensitization. none of the igg treatments induced immunological changes in the offspring, as it was observed for those from ova-immunized mothers.


CONCLUSIONS
maternal immunization upregulates the inhibitory fcγriib expression on offspring b cells, avoiding skewed th <dig> response and development of allergy. these findings contribute to the advancement of prophylactic strategies to prevent allergic diseases in early life.
