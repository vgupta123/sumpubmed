BACKGROUND
corynebacterium ulcerans can cause a diphtheria-like illness, especially when the bacterium is lysogenized with a tox gene-carrying bacteriophage that produces diphtheria toxin. acquisition of toxigenicity upon phage lysogenization is a common feature of c. ulcerans and c. diphtheriae. however, because of a lack of c. ulcerans genome information, a detailed comparison of prophages has not been possible between these two clinically important and closely related bacterial species.


RESULTS
we determined the whole genome sequence of the toxigenic c. ulcerans  <dig> isolated in japan. the genomic sequence showed a striking similarity with that of corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and, to a lesser extent, with that of c. diphtheriae. the  <dig> genome contained three distinct prophages. one of these, Î¦culc0102-i, was a tox-positive prophage containing genes in the same structural order as for tox-positive c. diphtheriae prophages. however, the primary structures of the individual genes involved in the phage machinery showed little homology between the two counterparts.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results suggest that the tox-positive prophage in this strain of c. ulcerans has a distinct origin from that of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>
