BACKGROUND
biomarkers for the early prediction of canine acute kidney injury  are clinically important. recently, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin  was found to be a sensitive biomarker for the prediction of human aki at a very early stage and the development of aki after surgery. however, ngal has not yet been studied with respect to dog kidney diseases. the application of ngal canine aki was investigated in this study.


RESULTS
the canine ngal gene was successfully cloned and expressed. polyclonal antibodies against canine ngal were generated and used to develop an elisa for measuring ngal protein in serum and urine samples that were collected from  <dig> dogs at different time points after surgery.

aki was defined by the standard method, namely a serum creatinine increase of greater than or equal to  <dig>  Î¼mol/l from baseline within  <dig> h. at  <dig> h after surgery, compared to the group without aki , the ngal level in the urine of seven dogs with aki was significantly increased , and this difference was sustained to  <dig> h.


CONCLUSIONS
as the increase in ngal occurred much earlier than the increase in serum creatinine, urine ngal seems to be able to serve as a sensitive and specific biomarker for the prediction of aki in dogs.
