BACKGROUND
to explore the potential value of high-throughput genotyping assays in the analysis of large and complex genomes, we designed two highly multiplexed illumina bead arrays using the goldengate snp assay for gene mapping in white spruce  and black spruce .


RESULTS
each array included  <dig> snps, identified by resequencing genomic dna from parents of each mapping population. for white spruce and black spruce, respectively,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of genotyped snps had valid goldengate assay scores and segregated in the mapping populations. for each of these successful snps, on average, valid genotyping scores were obtained for over 99% of progeny. snp data were integrated to pre-existing alfp, estp, and ssr markers to construct two individual linkage maps and a composite map for white spruce and black spruce genomes. the white spruce composite map contained  <dig> markers including  <dig> gene loci. also,  <dig> markers including  <dig> gene loci were positioned on the black spruce composite map. in total,  <dig> anchor markers  were shared between the two species. considering lineage divergence at least  <dig> myr ago between the two spruces, interspecific comparison of homoeologous linkage groups revealed remarkable synteny and marker colinearity.


CONCLUSIONS
the design of customized highly multiplexed illumina snp arrays appears as an efficient procedure to enhance the mapping of expressed genes and make linkage maps more informative and powerful in such species with poorly known genomes. this genotyping approach will open new avenues for co-localizing candidate genes and qtls, partial genome sequencing, and comparative mapping across conifers.
