BACKGROUND
hermansky-pudlak syndrome  is a disorder of lysosome-related organelle biogenesis characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and prolonged bleeding. these clinical findings reflect defects in the formation of melanosomes in melanocytes and dense bodies in platelets. hps type- <dig>  results from mutations in the hps <dig> gene, which encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein of unknown function that contains a predicted clathrin-binding motif  at residues 172– <dig> 


RESULTS
clathrin was co-immunoprecipitated by hps <dig> antibodies from normal but not hps <dig> null melanocytes. normal melanocytes expressing a gfp-hps <dig> fusion protein demonstrated partial co-localization of gfp-hps <dig> with clathrin following a 20°c temperature block. gfp-hps <dig> in which the predicted clathrin-binding domain of hps <dig> was mutated  did not co-localize with clathrin under the same conditions. immunoelectron microscopy of normal melanocytes expressing gfp-hps <dig> showed co-localization of gfp-hps <dig> with clathrin, predominantly on small vesicles in the perinuclear region. in contrast, gfp-hps3-delcbd did not co-localize with clathrin and exhibited a largely cytoplasmic distribution.


CONCLUSIONS
hps <dig> associates with clathrin, predominantly on small clathrin-containing vesicles in the perinuclear region. this association most likely occurs directly via a functional clathrin-binding domain in hps <dig>  these results suggest a role for hps <dig> and its protein complex, bloc- <dig>  in vesicle formation and trafficking.
