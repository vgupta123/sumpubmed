BACKGROUND
newborn granule neurons are generated from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells and integrated into mature synaptic networks in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. since light/dark variations of the mitotic index and dna synthesis occur in many tissues, we wanted to unravel the role of the clock-controlled period <dig> gene  in timing cell cycle kinetics and neurogenesis in the adult dg.


RESULTS
in contrast to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, we observed a non-rhythmic constitutive expression of mper <dig> in the dentate gyrus. we provide evidence that mper <dig> is expressed in proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells  and persists in early post-mitotic and mature newborn neurons from the adult dg. in vitro and in vivo analysis of a mouse line mutant in the mper <dig> gene , revealed a higher density of dividing npcs together with an increased number of immature newborn neurons populating the dg. however, we showed that the lack of mper <dig> does not change the total amount of mature adult-generated hippocampal neurons, because of a compensatory increase in neuronal cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data demonstrated a functional link between the constitutive expression of mper <dig> and the intrinsic control of neural stem/progenitor cells proliferation, cell death and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult mice.
