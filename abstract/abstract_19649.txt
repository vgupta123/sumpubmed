BACKGROUND
swi/snf chromatin remodeling enzymes play a critical role in the development of t helper lymphocytes, including th <dig> cells, and directly program chromatin structure at th <dig> cytokine genes. different versions of swi/snf complexes, including baf and pbaf, have been described based on unique subunit composition. however, the relative role of baf and pbaf in th cell function and cytokine expression has not been reported.


RESULTS
here we examine the role of the pbaf swi/snf complex in th cell development and gene expression using mice deficient for a pbaf-specific component, baf <dig>  we find that t cell development in the thymus and lymphoid periphery is largely normal when the baf <dig> gene is deleted late in thymic development. however, baf180-deficient th <dig> cells express high levels of the immunoregulatory cytokine il- <dig>  baf <dig> binds directly to regulatory elements in the il- <dig> locus but is replaced by baf <dig> baf complexes in the absence of baf <dig>  resulting in increased histone acetylation and cbp recruitment to the il- <dig> locus.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that baf <dig> is a repressor of il- <dig> transcription in th <dig> cells and suggest that the differential recruitment of different swi/snf subtypes can have direct consequences on chromatin structure and gene transcription.
