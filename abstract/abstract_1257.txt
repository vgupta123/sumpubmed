BACKGROUND
the inhibition of the activity of Î²-secretase  is a potentially important approach for the treatment of alzheimer disease. to explore the mechanism of inhibition, we describe the use of  <dig> x-ray crystallographic bace-1/inhibitor complexes to derive quantitative structure-activity relationship  models. the inhibitors were aligned by superimposing  <dig> x-ray crystallographic bace-1/inhibitor complexes, and gcombine software was used to perform comparative binding energy  analysis on these  <dig> minimized bace-1/inhibitor complexes. the major advantage of the combine analysis is that it can quantitatively extract key residues involved in binding the ligand and identify the nature of the interactions between the ligand and receptor.


RESULTS
by considering the contributions of the protein residues to the electrostatic and van der waals intermolecular interaction energies, two predictive and robust combine models were developed:  the 3-pc distance-dependent dielectric constant model  with a q <dig> value of  <dig>  and an sdec value of  <dig> ; and  the 5-pc sigmoidal electrostatic model  with a q <dig> value of  <dig>  and an sdec value of  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
these qsar models and the information describing the inhibition provide useful insights into the design of novel inhibitors via the optimization of the interactions between ligands and those key residues of bace- <dig>
