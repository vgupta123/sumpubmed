BACKGROUND
recently identified porcine circovirus-like virus p <dig> has the smallest dna viral genome. in this study, we identified the viral genes and their corresponding mrna transcripts.


RESULTS
the rnas of p <dig>  synthesized in porcine kidney cells, were examined with northern blotting and pcr analyses.

eight virus-specific rnas were detected. four mrnas   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 5) are encoded by the viral  strand and four  are encoded by the viral  strand. all proteins encoded by the orfs of the p <dig> virus are less than  <dig> amino acids in length, except that encoded by orf <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we show a very complex viral transcription pattern in p1-infected cells.
