BACKGROUND
autophagy is an essential process in the control of cellular homeostasis. it enables cells under certain stress conditions to survive by removing toxic cellular components, and may protect cells from apoptosis. in the present study, the signaling pathways involved in arv s <dig> regulated switch from autophagy to apoptosis were investigated.


RESULTS
arv s <dig> infection caused autophagy in the early to middle infectious stages in vero and df <dig> cells, and apoptosis in the middle to late stages. conversion of the autophagy marker lc3-i to lc3-ii occurred earlier than cleavage of the apoptotic marker caspase- <dig>  arv s <dig> also activated the beclin- <dig> promoter in the early to middle stages of infection. levels of rhoa-gtp and rock <dig> activity were elevated upon arv s <dig> infection, while inhibition of rhoa and rock <dig> reduced autophagy and subsequent apoptosis. conversely, inhibition of caspase- <dig> did not affect the level of autophagy. beclin- <dig> knockdown and treatment with autophagy inhibitors, 3-ma and bafilomycin a <dig>  suppressed arv s1133-induced autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously, suggesting the shift from autophagy to apoptosis. a co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the formation of a rhoa, rock <dig> and beclin- <dig> complex coincided with the induction of autophagy.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that rhoa/rock <dig> signaling play critical roles in the transition of cell activity from autophagy to apoptosis in arv s1133-infected cells.
