BACKGROUND
ubiquitylation plays an important role in regulating protein functions. recently, experimental methods were developed toward effective identification of ubiquitylation sites. to efficiently explore more undiscovered ubiquitylation sites, this study aims to develop an accurate sequence-based prediction method to identify promising ubiquitylation sites.


RESULTS
we established an ubiquitylation dataset consisting of  <dig> ubiquitylation sites and  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites extracted from  <dig> proteins in the ubiprot database. this study first evaluates promising sequence-based features and classifiers for the prediction of ubiquitylation sites by assessing three kinds of features  and three classifiers . results show that the set of used  <dig> physicochemical properties and support vector machine  are the best kind of features and classifier respectively that their combination has a prediction accuracy of  <dig> % using leave-one-out cross-validation.

consequently, an informative physicochemical property mining algorithm  is proposed to select an informative subset of  <dig> physicochemical properties. a prediction system ubipred was implemented by using an svm with the feature set of  <dig> informative physicochemical properties selected by ipma, which can improve the accuracy from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. to further analyze the informative physicochemical properties, a decision tree method c <dig>  was used to acquire if-then rule-based knowledge of predicting ubiquitylation sites. ubipred can screen promising ubiquitylation sites from putative non-ubiquitylation sites using prediction scores. by applying ubipred,  <dig> promising ubiquitylation sites were identified from an independent dataset of  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites, which were also validated by using the obtained prediction rules.


CONCLUSIONS
we have proposed an algorithm ipma for mining informative physicochemical properties from protein sequences to build an svm-based prediction system ubipred. ubipred can predict ubiquitylation sites accompanied with a prediction score each to help biologists in identifying promising sites for experimental verification. ubipred has been implemented as a web server and is available at .
