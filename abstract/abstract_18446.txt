BACKGROUND
normal cell cycle progression requires the precise activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases , which consist of a cdk and a cyclin subunit. a novel cell cycle regulator called speedy/ringo shows no sequence similarity to cyclins, yet can directly bind to and activate cdks. speedy/ringo proteins, which bind to and activate cdc <dig> and cdk <dig> in vitro, are required for the g <dig> to m transition during xenopus oocyte maturation and for normal s-phase entry in cultured human cells.


RESULTS
we have characterized the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of human cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> in order to gain insights into the possible functions of this complex. in contrast to cdk2-cyclin a, which has a well-defined consensus target site px) that strongly favors substrates containing a lysine at the + <dig> position of substrates, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> displayed a broad substrate specificity at this position. consequently, cdk2-ringo/speedy a <dig> phosphorylated optimal cdk <dig> substrates such as histone h <dig> and a ksprk peptide poorly, only ~ <dig> % as well as cdk2-cyclin a, but non-canonical cdk <dig> substrates such as a kspry peptide relatively well, with an efficiency of ~80% compared to cdk2-cyclin a. cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> also phosphorylated authentic cdk <dig> substrates, such as cdc <dig> proteins, which contain non-canonical cdk phosphorylation sites, nearly as well as cdk2-cyclin a. phosphopeptide mapping indicated that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-cyclin a phosphorylate distinct subsets of sites on cdc <dig> proteins. thus, the low activity that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> displays when assayed on conventional cdk <dig> substrates may significantly underestimate the potential physiological importance of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> in phosphorylating key subsets of cdk <dig> substrates. unlike cdk2-cyclin a, whose activity depends strongly on activating phosphorylation of cdk <dig> on thr- <dig>  neither the overall catalytic activity nor the substrate recognition by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> was significantly affected by this phosphorylation. furthermore, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> was not a suitable substrate for metazoan cak , supporting the notion that speedy/ringo a <dig> activates cdk <dig> in a cak-independent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
there are major differences in substrate preferences between cdk-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-cyclin complexes. these differences may accommodate the cak-independent activation of cdk <dig> by speedy/ringo a <dig> and they raise the possibility that cdk-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes could phosphorylate and regulate a subset of non-canonical cdk substrates, such as cdc <dig> protein phosphatases, to control cell cycle progression.
