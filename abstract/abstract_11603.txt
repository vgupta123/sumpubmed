BACKGROUND
vascular homeostasis and response to injury are dependent on the coordinated activity of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-a . vegf signaling is mediated by vegf receptors  <dig>  and  <dig> . vegf also binds to extracellular matrix  and neuropilin , a cell surface glycoprotein that enhances vegf binding to vegfr <dig> while inhibiting vegf-vegfr <dig> interactions. proteases such as neutrophil elastase release vegf bound to ecm; however, this results in proteolytic processing of vegf to a smaller species termed vegf fragment . we hypothesized that the generation and presence of vegff would have significant effects on the binding distribution of vegf.


RESULTS
we show that vegff, unlike vegf, does not bind ecm, fibronectin, or np- <dig>  using computational simulations, we find that excess vegff can lead to increased binding of vegf to vegfr <dig> through vegff binding to vegfr <dig> and subsequent liberation of np- <dig>  we show experimentally that vegf-induced migration has a biphasic response to conversion of vegf to vegff. simulations suggest that a simple change in vegfr <dig> or vegfr <dig> complexes are unlikely to be responsible and that a more complex integration of signals is more likely involved.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that proteolytic damage at sites of tissue injury and inflammation has the potential to modulate the vegf system through a complex process and highlight the need for quantitative analysis to reveal mechanisms of growth factor control.
