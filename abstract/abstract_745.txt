BACKGROUND
soybean  cyst nematode  is a major pest of soybean worldwide. the most effective strategy to control this pest involves the use of resistant cultivars. the aim of the present study was to investigate the genome-wide genetic architecture of resistance to scn hg type  <dig> . <dig>  in landrace and elite cultivated soybeans.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> diverse soybean accessions were screened for resistance to scn hg type  <dig> . <dig> and genotyped through sequencing using the specific locus amplified fragment sequencing  approach with a  <dig> -fold average sequencing depth. a total of  <dig>  snps were identified with minor allele frequencies  over 4%, covering 97% of all the genotypes. genome-wide association mapping  revealed thirteen snps associated with resistance to scn hg type  <dig> . <dig>  these snps were distributed on five chromosomes , including chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  four snps were novel resistance loci and nine snps were located near known qtl. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as candidate genes underlying scn resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
a total of sixteen novel soybean accessions were identified with significant resistance to hg type  <dig> . <dig>  the beneficial alleles and candidate genes identified by gwas might be valuable for improving marker-assisted breeding efficiency and exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying scn resistance.
