BACKGROUND
skipper butterflies  are a relatively well-studied family of lepidoptera. however, a combination of dna barcodes, morphology, and natural history data has revealed several cryptic species complexes within them. here, we investigate three dna barcode lineages of what has been identified as urbanus belli  in Área de conservación guanacaste , northwestern costa rica.


RESULTS
although no morphological traits appear to distinguish among the three, congruent nuclear and mitochondrial lineage patterns show that “urbanus belli” in acg is a complex of three sympatric species. a single strain of wolbachia present in two of the three cryptic species indicates that urbanus segnestami burns , urbanus bernikerni burns , and urbanus ehakernae burns  may be biologically separated by wolbachia, as well as by their genetics. use of parallel sequencing through 454-pyrosequencing improved the utility of its <dig> as a phylogenetic marker and permitted examination of the intra- and interlineage relationships of its <dig> variants within the species complex. interlineage, intralineage and intragenomic compensatory base pair changes were discovered in the secondary structure of its <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these findings corroborate the existence of three cryptic species. our confirmation of a novel cryptic species complex, initially suggested by dna barcode lineages, argues for using a multi-marker approach coupled with next-generation sequencing for exploration of other suspected species complexes.
