BACKGROUND
amino acid sequence diversity is introduced into a phage-displayed peptide library by randomizing library oligonucleotide dna. we recently evaluated the diversity of peptide libraries displayed on t <dig> lytic phage and m <dig> filamentous phage and showed that t <dig> phage can display a more diverse amino acid sequence repertoire due to differing processes of viral morphogenesis.

methods
in this study, we evaluated and compared the diversity of a 12-mer t <dig> phage-displayed peptide library randomized using codon-corrected trinucleotide cassettes with a t <dig> and an m <dig> 12-mer phage-displayed peptide library constructed using the degenerate codon randomization method.


RESULTS
we herein demonstrate that the combination of trinucleotide cassette amino acid codon randomization and t <dig> phage display construction methods resulted in a significant enhancement to the functional diversity of a 12-mer peptide library. this novel library exhibited superior amino acid uniformity and order-of-magnitude increases in amino acid sequence diversity as compared to degenerate codon randomized peptide libraries. comparative analyses of the biophysical characteristics of the 12-mer peptide libraries revealed the trinucleotide cassette-randomized library to be a unique resource.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of t <dig> phage display and trinucleotide cassette randomization resulted in a novel resource for the potential isolation of binding peptides for new and previously studied molecular targets.
