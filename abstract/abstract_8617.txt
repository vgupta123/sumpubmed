BACKGROUND
the unfolded protein response  is an evolutionary conserved adaptive reaction for increasing cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum  stress conditions. x-box-binding protein- <dig>  is a key transcription factor of upr that activates genes involved in protein folding, secretion, and degradation to restore er function. the upr induced by er stress was extensively studied in diseases linked to protein misfolding and aggregations. however, in the porcine system, genes in the upr pathway were not investigated. in this study, we isolated and characterized the porcine xbp <dig>  gene in er stress using porcine embryonic fibroblast  cells and porcine organs. er stress was induced by the treatment of tunicamycin and cell viability was investigated by the mtt assay. for cloning and analyzing the expression pattern of pxbp <dig>  rt-pcr analysis and western blot were used. knock-down of pxbp <dig> was performed by the sirna-mediated gene silencing.


RESULTS
we found that the pxbp <dig> mrna was the subject of the ire1Î±-mediated unconventional splicing by er stress. knock-down of pxbp <dig> enhanced er stress-mediated cell death in pef cells. in adult organs, pxbp <dig> mrna and protein were expressed and the spliced forms were detected.


CONCLUSIONS
it was first found that the upr mechanisms and the function of pxbp <dig> in the porcine system. these results indicate that pxbp <dig> plays an important role during the er stress response like other animal systems and open a new opportunity for examining the upr pathway in the porcine model system.
