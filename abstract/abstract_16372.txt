BACKGROUND
cd <dig> is a membrane receptor containing a lectin domain and a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif  that is able to inhibit cytokine production. cd <dig> is expressed by monocytes, and reduced expression of cd <dig> correlates with augmented production of inflammatory cytokines, such as il-1β, tnf-α, and il- <dig>  however, the role of cd <dig> in the inflammation associated with hyperglycemia and diabetes is unknown. therefore, we studied cd <dig> expression and inflammatory cytokine secretion in freshly isolated monocytes from patients with type  <dig> diabetes. to evaluate the effects of hyperglycemia, monocytes from healthy donors were cultured with different glucose concentrations , and cd <dig> expression and inflammatory cytokine production were assessed. the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling protein- <dig>  and the generation of reactive oxygen species  were also evaluated to address the cellular mechanisms involved in the down-regulation of cd <dig> 


RESULTS
cd <dig> expression was significantly decreased in monocytes from patients with type  <dig> diabetes, and higher levels of tnf-α, il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> were detected in the plasma of patients compared to healthy donors. under high glucose conditions, cd <dig> protein and mrna expression was significantly decreased, whereas spontaneous tnf-α secretion and socs- <dig> mrna expression were increased in monocytes from healthy donors. furthermore, the down-regulation of cd <dig> and increase in tnf-α production were prevented when monocytes were treated with the antioxidant α-tocopherol and cultured under high glucose conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that hyperglycemia down-regulates cd <dig> expression and triggers the spontaneous secretion of tnf-α by peripheral monocytes. this phenomenon involves the generation of ros and the up-regulation of socs- <dig>  these observations support the importance of blood glucose control for maintaining innate immune function and suggest the participation of cd <dig> in the inflammatory profile associated with type  <dig> diabetes.
