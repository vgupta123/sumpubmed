BACKGROUND
currently available vaccines against leptospirosis are of low efficacy, have an unacceptable side-effect profile, do not induce long-term protection, and provide no cross-protection against the different serovars of pathogenic leptospira. the current major focus in leptospirosis research is to discover conserved protective antigens that may elicit longer-term protection against a broad range of leptospira. there is a need to screen vaccine candidate genes in the genome of leptospira interrogans.


RESULTS
bioinformatics, comparative genomic hybridization  analysis and transcriptional analysis were used to identify vaccine candidates in the genome of l. interrogans serovar lai strain # <dig>  of a total of  <dig> open reading frames ,  <dig> genes were predicted to encode surface-exposed proteins by p-classifier combined with signal peptide prediction, α-helix transmembrane topology prediction, integral β-barrel outer membrane protein and lipoprotein prediction, as well as by retaining the genes shared by the two sequenced l. interrogans genomes and by subtracting genes with human homologues. a dna microarray of l. interrogans strain # <dig> was constructed for cgh analysis and transcriptome analysis in vitro. three hundred and seven differential genes were identified in ten pathogenic serovars by cgh;  <dig> genes had high transcriptional levels . there were  <dig> genes in the intersection between the set encoding surface-exposed proteins and the set of  <dig> differential genes. the number of genes in the intersection between this set of  <dig> and the set of  <dig> highly transcriptionally active genes was  <dig>  these  <dig> genes were thus identified as putative vaccine candidates. the proteins encoded by these genes are not only potentially surface-exposed in the bacterium, but also conserved in two sequenced l. interrogans. moreover, these genes are conserved among ten epidemic serovars in china and have high transcriptional levels in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
of the  <dig> orfs in the genome of l. interrogans,  <dig> genes were identified as vaccine candidates by bioinformatics, cgh and transcriptional analysis on the basis of the theory of reverse vaccinology. the proteins encoded by these genes might be useful as vaccine candidates as well as for diagnosis of leptospirosis.
