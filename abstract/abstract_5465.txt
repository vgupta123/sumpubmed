BACKGROUND
the increasing number of genomic sequences of bacteria makes it possible to select unique snps of a particular strain/species at the whole genome level and thus design specific primers based on the snps. the high similarity of genomic sequences among phylogenetically-related bacteria requires the identification of the few loci in the genome that can serve as unique markers for strain differentiation. primersnp attempts to identify reliable strain-specific markers, on which specific primers are designed for pathogen detection purpose.


RESULTS
primersnp is an online tool to design primers based on strain specific snps for multiple strains/species of microorganisms at the whole genome level. the allele-specific primers could distinguish query sequences of one strain from other homologous sequences by standard pcr reaction. additionally, primersnp provides a feature for designing common primers that can amplify all the homologous sequences of multiple strains/species of microorganisms. primersnp is freely available at .


CONCLUSIONS
primersnp is a high-throughput specific primer generation tool for the differentiation of phylogenetically-related strains/species. experimental validation showed that this software had a successful prediction rate of  <dig>  â€“ 100% for strain specific primer design.
