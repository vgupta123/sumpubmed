BACKGROUND
chrysanthemum is one of the most important ornamental crops in the world and drought stress seriously limits its production and distribution. in order to generate a functional genomics resource and obtain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms regarding chrysanthemum responses to dehydration stress, we performed large-scale transcriptome sequencing of chrysanthemum plants under dehydration stress using the illumina sequencing technology.


RESULTS
two cdna libraries constructed from mrnas of control and dehydration-treated seedlings were sequenced by illumina technology. a total of more than  <dig> million reads were generated and de novo assembled into  <dig>  unique transcripts which were further extensively annotated by comparing their sequencing to different protein databases. biochemical pathways were predicted from these transcript sequences. furthermore, we performed gene expression profiling analysis upon dehydration treatment in chrysanthemum and identified  <dig>  dehydration-responsive unique transcripts, including  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> protein kinases and many well-known stress responsive genes. gene ontology  term enrichment and biochemical pathway analyses showed that dehydration stress caused changes in hormone response, secondary and amino acid metabolism, and light and photoperiod response. these findings suggest that drought tolerance of chrysanthemum plants may be related to the regulation of hormone biosynthesis and signaling, reduction of oxidative damage, stabilization of cell proteins and structures, and maintenance of energy and carbon supply.


CONCLUSIONS
our transcriptome sequences can provide a valuable resource for chrysanthemum breeding and research and novel insights into chrysanthemum responses to dehydration stress and offer candidate genes or markers that can be used to guide future studies attempting to breed drought tolerant chrysanthemum cultivars.
