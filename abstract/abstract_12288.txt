BACKGROUND
shigella flexneri is the major pathogen causing bacillary dysentery. fifteen serotypes have been recognized up to now. the genesis of new s. flexneri serotypes is commonly mediated by serotype-converting bacteriophages. untypeable or novel serotypes from natural infections had been reported worldwide but have not been generated in laboratory.


RESULTS
a new s. flexneri serotype-serotype  <dig> d was generated when a s. flexneri serotype y strain  was sequentially infected with  <dig> serotype-converting bacteriophages, sfx first and then sfi. the new serotype  <dig> d strain agglutinated with both serotype x-specific anti-7; <dig> grouping serum and serotype 1a-specific anti- i typing serum, and differed from subserotypes 1a, 1b and 1c. twenty four s. flexneri clinical isolates of serotype x were all converted to serotype  <dig> d by infection with phage sfi. pcr and sequencing revealed that sfi and sfx were integrated in tandem into the proa-yaic region of the host chromosome.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest a new s. flexneri serotype could be created in nature. such a conversion may be constrained by susceptibility of a strain to infection by a given serotype-converting bacteriophage. this finding has significant implications in the emergence of new s. flexneri serotypes in nature.
