BACKGROUND
histone acetyltransferases  play critical roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> hat genes, but the biological functions of many of them are still unknown. in this work, we studied the evolutionary relationship and cellular functions of the two arabidopsis hat genes homologous to the myst family members.


RESULTS
an extensive phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> myst proteins revealed that they can be divided into  <dig> classes, each of which contains a specific combination of protein modules. the two arabidopsis myst proteins, ham <dig> and ham <dig>  belong to a "green clade", clearly separated from other families of hats. using a reverse genetic approach, we show that ham <dig> and ham <dig> are a functionally redundant pair of genes, as single arabidopsis ham <dig> and ham <dig> mutants displayed a wild-type phenotype, while no double mutant seedling could be recovered. genetic analysis and cytological study revealed that ham1ham <dig> double mutation induced severe defects in the formation of male and female gametophyte, resulting in an arrest of mitotic cell cycle at early stages of gametogenesis. rt-pcr experiments and the analysis of transgenic plants expressing the gus reporter gene under the ham <dig> or the ham <dig> promoter showed that both genes displayed an overlapping expression pattern, mainly in growing organs such as shoots and flower buds.


CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here reveals novel properties for myst hats in arabidopsis. in addition to providing an evolutionary relationship of this large protein family, we show the evidence of a link between myst and gamete formation as previously suggested in mammalian cells. a possible function of the arabidopsis myst protein-mediated histone acetylation during cell division is suggested.
