BACKGROUND
accumulating evidence demonstrates that non-coding rnas  are indispensable components of many organisms and play important roles in cellular events, regulation, and development.


RESULTS
here, we analysed the small non-coding rna  transcriptome of trichophyton rubrum by constructing and sequencing a cdna library from conidia and mycelia. we identified  <dig> ncrnas and their corresponding genomic loci. these ncrna candidates included  <dig> entirely novel ncrnas and  <dig> known ncrnas classified as snrnas, snornas and other known ncrnas. further bioinformatic analysis detected  <dig> snornas, including  <dig> snornas that had been annotated in other organisms and  <dig> novel snornas. all snornas belonged to two major classes—c/d box snornas and h/aca snornas—and their potential target sites in rrnas and snrnas were predicted. to analyse the evolutionary conservation of the ncrnas in t. rubrum, we aligned all  <dig> ncrnas to the genomes of six dermatophytes and to the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide database . the results showed that most of the identified snrnas were conserved in dermatophytes. of the  <dig> ncrnas,  <dig> also had genomic loci in other dermatophytes, and  <dig> were dermatophyte-specific.


CONCLUSIONS
our systematic analysis may provide important clues to the function and evolution of ncrnas in t. rubrum. these results also provide important information to complement the current annotation of the t. rubrum genome, which primarily comprises protein-coding genes.
