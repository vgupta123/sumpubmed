BACKGROUND
spartin protein is involved in degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor and turnover of lipid droplets and a lack of expression of this protein is responsible for hereditary spastic paraplegia type  <dig> . spartin is a multifunctional protein that associates with many cellular organelles, including lipid droplets. recent studies showed that spartin interacts with e <dig> ubiquitin ligases that belong to the neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated gene  family, including atrophin-1-interacting protein  <dig> . however, the biological importance of the spartin-aip <dig> interaction remains unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, we show that spartin is not a substrate for aip <dig> activity and that spartin's binding to aip <dig> significantly increases self-ubiquitination of this e <dig> ligase, indicating that spartin disrupts the aip <dig> autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction. correspondingly, spartin has a seven times higher binding affinity to the ww region of aip <dig> than the binding of the ww region has to the catalytic homologues of the e6-associated protein c-terminus  domain, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. we also show that spartin recruits aip <dig> to lipid droplets and promotes ubiquitination of lipid droplet-associated protein, adipophilin, which regulates turnover of lipid droplets.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that spartin acts as an adaptor protein that activates and recruits aip <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase to lipid droplets and by this means regulates the level of ubiquitination of adipophilin and potentially other lipid-associated proteins. we propose that this is one of the mechanisms by which spartin regulates lipid droplet turnover and might contribute to the pathology of spg <dig>
