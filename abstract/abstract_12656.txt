BACKGROUND
the olfactory ensheathing cells  derived from olfactory bulb  may improve motor function after transplantation in injured spinal cord. however, the effects of oec transplantation on sensory function have not been reported yet. the purpose of this study is to investigate whether oec transplantation could affect the sensory function and to analyze the underlying mechanism.


RESULTS
oec transplantation into the hemisected spinal cords can result in hyperalgesia, indicated by radiant and mechanical stimuli towards the plantar surface in rats. this could be associated with upregulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor , indicated by rt-pcr. immunofluorecent staining showed that bdnf was mainly located in the neurons of the laminas i and ii of the dorsal horn. moreover, a notable upregulation on the level of p-erk , the downstream molecule of bdnf, was detected by using western blot. these findings indicate that the increased bdnf level associated with the p-erk was possibly involved in neuropathic pain in hemisected spinal cord subjected to oec transplantation.


CONCLUSIONS
the transplantation of oecs may induce the noticeable pain hypersensitivity in rats after hemisected spinal cord injury, and the possible mechanism may be associated with the phosphorylation of erk and the activated bdnf overexpression.
