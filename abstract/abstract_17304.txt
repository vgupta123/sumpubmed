BACKGROUND
sirt <dig> is a mammalian homologue of nad+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin family. it regulates longevity in several model organisms and is involved with cell survival, differentiation, metabolism among other processes in mammalian cells. sirt <dig> modulates functions of various key targets via deacetylation. recent studies have revealed sirt <dig> protects neurons from axonal degeneration or neurodegeneration. further, sirt <dig> null mice exhibit growth retardation and developmental defects, suggesting its critical roles in neurons and development.


RESULTS
to identify novel binding partners for sirt <dig> in the central nervous system, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening on human fetal brain cdna library and found that zyxin is a possible binding partner. sirt <dig> and zyxin transcript were both preferentially expressed in developmental mouse brain. zyxin accumulates in the nucleus where it is co-localized with sirt <dig> after treatment with leptomycin b in cos- <dig> cells. furthermore, sirt <dig> deacetylates zyxin, suggesting sirt <dig> could interact with nuclear-accumulated zyxin and modulate its function through deacetylation.


CONCLUSIONS
zyxin could be a novel interacting partner of sirt <dig>  zyxin is an adaptor protein at focal adhesion plaque, regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction to convey signal from the ecm  to the nucleus. our results raise the possibility that sirt <dig> regulates signal transmission from ecm to the nucleus by modulating the functions of zyxin via deacetylation.
