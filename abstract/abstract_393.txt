BACKGROUND
leukocyte function antigen- <dig>  is a primary adhesion molecule that plays important roles in t cell activation, leukocyte recirculation, and trans-endothelial migration. by applying a multivariate intracellular phospho-proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that lfa- <dig> differentially activates signaling molecules.


RESULTS
signal intensity was dependent on both icam ligand and lfa- <dig> concentration. in the presence of cd <dig> and cd <dig> stimulation, icam- <dig> and icam- <dig> decreased tgfβ <dig> production more than icam- <dig>  in long-term differentiation experiments, stimulation with icam- <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> generated ifnγ producing cd4+cd45ro+cd62l-cd11abrightcd27- cells that had increased expression of intracellular bcl <dig>  displayed distinct chemokine receptor profiles, and exhibited distinct migratory characteristics. only cd3/cd <dig> with icam- <dig> generated cd4+cd45ro+cd62l-cd11abrightcd27- cells that were functionally responsive to chemotaxis and exhibited higher frequencies of cells that signaled to jnk and erk1/ <dig> upon stimulation with mip3α. furthermore, these reports identify that the lfa- <dig> receptor, when presented with multiple ligands, can result in distinct t cell differentiation states and suggest that the combinatorial integration of icam ligand interactions with lfa- <dig> have functional consequences for t cell biology.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, the icam ligands, differentially modulate lfa- <dig> signaling in t cells and potentiate the development of memory human t cells in vitro. these findings are of importance in a mechanistic understanding of memory cell differentiation and ex vivo generation of memory cell subsets for therapeutic applications.
