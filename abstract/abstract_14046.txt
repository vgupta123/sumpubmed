BACKGROUND
the current investigation was undertaken to determine key steps differentiating g:t and g:a repair at the h-ras oncogenic hot spot within the nuclear environment because of the large difference in repair efficiency of these two mismatches.


RESULTS
electrophoretic mobility shift  experiments demonstrate that dna containing mismatched bases are recognized and bound equally efficiently by hmutsα in both mmr proficient and mmr deficient  nuclear extracts. competition experiments demonstrate that while hmutsα predictably binds the g:t mismatch to a much greater extent than g:a, hmutsα demonstrates a surprisingly equal ratio of competitive inhibition for both g:t and g:a mismatch binding reactions at the h-ras hot spot of mutation. further, mismatch repair assays reveal almost 2-fold higher efficiency of overall g:a repair , as compared to g:t overall repair. conversely, correct mmr of g:t → g:c is significantly higher  than that of g:a → g:c .


CONCLUSIONS
combined, these results suggest that initiation of correct mmr requires the contribution of two separate steps; initial recognition by hmutsα followed by subsequent binding. the 'avidity' of the binding step determines the extent of mmr pathway activation, or the activation of a different cellular pathway. thus, initial recognition by hmutsα in combination with subsequent decreased binding to the g:a mismatch  may contribute to the observed increased frequency of incorrect repair of g:a, resulting in the predominant ggc → gtc  ras-activating mutation found in a high percentage of human tumors.
