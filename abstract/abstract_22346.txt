BACKGROUND
baculoviruses are widely used for the production of recombinant proteins, biopesticides and as gene delivery systems. one of the viral forms called polyhedra has been recently exploited as a scaffold system to incorporate or encapsulate foreign proteins or peptide fragments. however, an efficient strategy for foreign protein incorporation has not been thoroughly studied.


RESULTS
based on the crystal structure of polyhedrin, we conducted an in silico analysis of the baculovirus autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus  polyhedrin protein to select the minimum fragments of polyhedrin that could be incorporated into polyhedra. using confocal and transmission electron microscopy we analyzed the expression and cellular localization of the different polyhedrin fragments fused to the green fluorescent protein  used as reporter. the amino fragment 1– <dig> contains two repeats formed each of two β sheets followed by a α helix  that are important for the formation and stability of polyhedra. these fragments 1– <dig>  58– <dig> and 1– <dig> could be incorporated into polyhedra. however, only fragments 1– <dig> and 58– <dig> can self-aggregate.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that 58– <dig> is the minimum fragment that contributes to the assembly of the recombinant polyhedra via self-aggregation. this is the minimum sequence that can be used to efficiently incorporate foreign proteins into polyhedra.
