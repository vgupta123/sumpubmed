BACKGROUND

in highly complex social settings, an animal’s motivational drive to pursue an object depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the object, but also on whether the decision-making animal perceives an object as being the most desirable among others. mimetic desire refers to a subject’s preference for objects already possessed by another subject. to date, there are no appropriate animal models for studying whether mimetic desire is at play in guiding the decision-making process. furthermore, the neuropharmacological bases of decision-making processes are not well understood. in this study, we used an animal model  to investigate a novel food-foraging paradigm for decision-making, with or without a mimetic desire paradigm.


RESULTS
faced with the choice of foraging in a competitive environment, rats preferred foraging for the desirable object, indicating the rats’ ability for decision-making. notably, treatment with the non-competitive n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist mk- <dig>  but not with the dopamine d <dig> or d <dig> receptor antagonists, sch <dig> and haloperidol, respectively, suppressed the food foraging preference when there was a competing resident rat in the cage. none of these three antagonists affected the food-foraging preference for palatable food. moreover, mk- <dig> and sch <dig>  but not haloperidol, were able to abolish the desirable environment effect on standard food-foraging activities in complex social settings.


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlight the concept that mimetic desire exerts a powerful influence on food-foraging decision-making in rats and, further, illustrate the various roles of the glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems in mediating these processes.
