BACKGROUND
control of the host transcriptome represents a key battleground in the interaction of plants and pathogens. specifically, plants have evolved complex defense systems that induce profound transcriptional changes in response to pathogen attack while pathogens have evolved mechanisms to subvert or disable these defenses. several nac transcription factors such as ataf <dig> have been linked to plant defense responses, including those targeting viruses. the replication protein of tobacco mosaic virus  has been shown to interact with and target the degradation of ataf <dig>  these findings suggest that the transcriptional targets of ataf <dig> are involved in defense against tmv.


RESULTS
to detect potential ataf <dig> transcriptional targets, a genomic pull-down assay was utilized to identify ataf <dig> promoter binding sequences. subsequent mobility shift and dna footprinting assays identified a 30-bp ataf <dig> binding sequence. an in vivo gus reporter system confirmed the function of the identified 30-bp binding sequence as an ataf <dig> specific transcriptional activator in planta. gel filtration studies of purified ataf <dig> protein and mutagenesis studies of the 30-bp binding sequence indicate ataf <dig> functions as a dimer. computational analysis of interacting promoter sequences identified a corresponding 25-bp a/t-rich consensus sequence with repeating aaa motifs. upon ataf <dig> induction real-time qrt-pcr studies confirmed the accumulation of select gene transcripts whose promoters contain this consensus sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
we report the identification of a cis-regulatory binding sequence for ataf <dig>  different from other known nac protein binding sequences, the a/t-rich ataf <dig> binding motif represents a novel binding sequence for nac family proteins. combined this information represents a unique tool for the identification of ataf <dig> target genes.
