BACKGROUND
nearly half of the west eurasian assemblage of human mitochondrial dna  is fractioned into numerous sub-lineages of the predominant haplogroup  r <dig>  several hypotheses have been proposed on the origin and the expansion times of some r <dig> sub-lineages, which were partially inconsistent with each other. here we describe the phylogenetic structure and genetic variety of hg r <dig> in five european populations and one population from the middle east.


RESULTS
our analysis of  <dig>  mtdna haplotypes belonging to r <dig>  including entire control region sequences and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms from the coding region, revealed significant differences in the distribution of different sub-hgs even between geographically closely located regions. estimates of coalescence times that were derived using diverse algorithmic approaches consistently affirmed that the major expansions of the different r <dig> hgs occurred in the terminal pleistocene and early holocene.


CONCLUSIONS
given an estimated coalescence time of the distinct lineages of  <dig> â€“  <dig> kya, the differences in the distributions could hint to either limited maternal gene flow after the last glacial maximum due to the alpine nature of the regions involved or to a stochastic loss of diversity due to environmental events and/or disease episodes occurred at different times and in distinctive regions. our comparison of two different ways of obtaining the timing of the most recent common ancestor confirms that the time of a sudden expansion can be adequately recovered from control region data with valid confidence intervals. for reliable estimates, both procedures should be applied in order to cross-check the results for validity and soundness.
