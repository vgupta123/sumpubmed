BACKGROUND
the emergence of bacterial drug resistance encourages the re-evaluation of the potential of existing antimicrobials. lantibiotics are post-translationally modified, ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides with a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. here, we focussed on expanding the potential of lacticin  <dig>  one of the most studied lantibiotics and one which possesses potent activity against a wide range of gram positive species including many nosocomial pathogens. more specifically, our aim was to investigate if lacticin  <dig> activity could be enhanced when combined with a range of different clinical antibiotics.


RESULTS
initial screening revealed that polymyxin b and polymyxin e  exhibited synergistic activity with lacticin  <dig>  checkerboard assays were performed against a number of strains, including both gram positive and gram negative species. the resultant fractional inhibitory concentration  index values established that, while partial synergy was detected against gram positive targets, synergy was obvious against gram negative species, including cronobacter and e. coli.


CONCLUSIONS
combining lacticin  <dig> with low levels of a polymyxin could provide a means of broadening target specificity of the lantibiotic, while also reducing polymyxin use due to the lower concentrations required as a result of synergy.
