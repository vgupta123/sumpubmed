BACKGROUND
this study compared the transduction efficiencies of an adeno-associated viral  vector, which was pseudotyped with an aav <dig> capsid and encoded the green fluorescent protein , with a lentiviral  vector, which was pseudotyped with a vsv-g envelop and encoded the discosoma red fluorescent protein , to investigate which viral vector transduced the lateral hypothalamus or the amygdala more efficiently. the lv-dsred and aav1-gfp vector were mixed and injected into the lateral hypothalamus or into the amygdala of adult rats. the titers that were injected were  <dig> ×  <dig> or  <dig> ×  <dig> genomic copies of aav1-gfp and  <dig> ×  <dig> transducing units of lv-dsred.


RESULTS
immunostaining for gfp and dsred showed that aav1-gfp transduced significantly more cells than lv-dsred in both the lateral hypothalamus and the amygdala. in addition, the number of lv particles that were injected can not easily be increased, while the number of aav <dig> particles can be increased easily with a factor  <dig> to  <dig>  both viral vectors appear to predominantly transduce neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that aav <dig> vectors are better tools to overexpress or knockdown genes in the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala of adult rats, since more cells can be transduced with aav <dig> than with lv vectors and the titer of aav <dig> vectors can easily be increased to transduce the area of interest.
