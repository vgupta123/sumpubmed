BACKGROUND
quinine is a natural molecule commonly used as a flavouring agent in tonic water. diet supplementation with quinine leads to decreased body weight and food intake in rats. quinine is an in vitro inhibitor of trpm <dig>  a cation channel expressed in taste bud cells, the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. the objective of this work is to determine the effect of diet supplementation with quinine on body weight and body composition in male mice, to investigate its mechanism of action, and whether the effect is mediated through trpm <dig> 


RESULTS
compared with mice consuming ain, a regular balanced diet, mice consuming ain diet supplemented with  <dig> % quinine gained less weight  and less fat mass  after 13â€‰weeks of diet, and had lower blood glucose and plasma triglycerides. there was no difference in food intake between the mice consuming quinine supplemented diet and those consuming control diet. trpm <dig> knockout mice gained less fat mass than wild-type mice. there was a trend for a diet-genotype interaction for body weight and body weight gain, with the effect of quinine less pronounced in the trpm <dig> ko than in the wt background. faecal weight, energy and lipid contents were higher in quinine fed mice compared to regular ain fed mice and in trpm <dig> ko mice compared to wild type mice.


CONCLUSIONS
quinine contributes to weight control in male c57bl <dig> mice without affecting food intake. a partial contribution of trpm <dig> to quinine dependent body weight control is suggested.
