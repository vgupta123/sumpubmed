BACKGROUND
daphnia pulex  is the first fully sequenced crustacean genome. the crustaceans and insects have diverged from a common ancestor. it is a model organism for studying the molecular makeup for coping with the environmental challenges. in the complete proteome, there are  <dig>  putative proteins. however, about  <dig>  of them have no known homologues. currently, the uniprotokb reports on 95% of the daphnia's proteins as putative and uncharacterized proteins.


RESULTS
we have applied protonet, an unsupervised hierarchical protein clustering method that covers about  <dig> million sequences, for automatic annotation of the daphnia's proteome.  <dig> %  of the daphnia full-length proteins were successfully mapped to  <dig>  protonet stable clusters, and only  <dig> % remained unmapped. we compared the properties of the daphnia's protein families with those of the mouse and the fruitfly proteomes. functional annotations were successfully assigned for 86% of the proteins. most proteins  were mapped to only  <dig> clusters that contain daphnia's duplicated genes. we focused on the functionality of maximally amplified paralogs. cuticle structure components and a variety of ion channels protein families were associated with a maximal level of gene amplification. we focused on gene amplification as a leading strategy of the daphnia in coping with environmental toxicity.


CONCLUSIONS
automatic inference is achieved through mapping of sequences to the protein family tree of protonet  <dig> . applying a careful inference protocol resulted in functional assignments for over 86% of the complete proteome. we conclude that the scaffold of protonet can be used as an alignment-free protocol for large-scale annotation task of uncharacterized proteomes.
