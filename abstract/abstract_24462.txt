BACKGROUND
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor  is a hematopoietic growth factor involved in the generation of granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells. we have recently demonstrated that gm-csf has anti-apoptotic functions on neurons, and is neuroprotective in animal stroke models.


RESULTS
the gm-csf receptor Î± is expressed on adult neural stem cells in the rodent brain, and in culture. addition of gm-csf to nscs in vitro increased neuronal differentiation in a dose-dependent manner as determined by quantitative pcr, reporter gene assays, and facs analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
similar to the hematopoietic factor granulocyte-colony stimulating factor , gm-csf stimulates neuronal differentiation of adult nscs. these data highlight the astonishingly similar functions of major hematopoietic factors in the brain, and raise the clinical attractiveness of gm-csf as a novel drug for neurological disorders.
