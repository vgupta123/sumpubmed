BACKGROUND
we reported previously that root elongation in arabidopsis is promoted by exogenous proline, raising the possibility that this amino acid may modulate root growth.


RESULTS
to evaluate this hypothesis we used a combination of genetic, pharmacological and molecular analyses, and showed that proline specifically affects root growth by modulating the size of the root meristem. the effects of proline on meristem size are parallel to, and independent from, hormonal pathways, and do not involve the expression of genes controlling cell differentiation at the transition zone. on the contrary, proline appears to control cell division in early stages of postembryonic root development, as shown by the expression of the g2/m-specific cyclinb1; <dig>  gene.


CONCLUSIONS
the overall data suggest that proline can modulate the size of root meristematic zone in arabidopsis likely controlling cell division and, in turn, the ratio between cell division and cell differentiation.
