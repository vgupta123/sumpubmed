BACKGROUND
the rapid growth of protein-protein interaction  data has led to the emergence of ppi network analysis. despite advances in high-throughput techniques, the interactomes of several model organisms are still far from complete. therefore, it is desirable to expand these interactomes with ortholog-based and other methods.


RESULTS
orthologous pairs of  <dig> eukaryotic species were expanded and merged with experimental ppi datasets. the contributions of interologs from each species were evaluated. the expanded orthologous pairs enable the inference of interologs for various species. for example, more than  <dig>  human interactions can be predicted. the same dataset has also been applied to the prediction of host-pathogen interactions. ppis between p. falciparum calmodulin and several h. sapiens proteins are predicted, and these interactions may contribute to the maintenance of host cell ca2+ concentration. using comparisons with bayesian and structure-based approaches, interactions between putative hsp <dig> homologs of p. falciparum and the h. sapiens tnf receptor associated factor family are revealed, suggesting a role for these interactions in the interference of the human immune response to p. falciparum.


CONCLUSIONS
the ppi datasets are available from point  and poinet . further development of methods to predict host-pathogen interactions should incorporate multiple approaches in order to improve sensitivity, and should facilitate the identification of targets for drug discovery and design.
