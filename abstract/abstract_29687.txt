BACKGROUND
predisposing factors of pyogenic odontogenic infection include dental caries, pericoronitis, periodontitis, trauma to the dentition and the supporting structures or complications of dental procedures. the infections are usually polymicrobial involving normal endogenous flora. we characterised pyogenic odontogenic infection in patients attending mulago hospital, uganda.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> patients,  <dig>  were female. the most frequently involved fascial spaces were: the buccal,  <dig> ; submasseteric,  <dig>  and the submandibular space,  <dig> . dental caries was the most prevalent predisposing factor, particularly of the lower third molar teeth. viridans streptococci group and staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent bacterial isolates:  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. all viridans streptococci isolates were resistant to penicillin g, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim , ampicillin and tetracycline, but susceptible to vancomycin. all staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to cotrimoxazole and ampicillin while retaining susceptibility to vancomycin, cefotaxime, linezolid, moxifloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. thirty five  patients were hiv infected and the hiv status did not significantly influence the pattern of odontogenic infection.


CONCLUSIONS
dental caries was the most prevalent predisposing factor for pyogenic odontogenic infection. high prevalence of bacterial resistance to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole suggests the need for regular antibiotic susceptibility tests of isolates and rational use of antibiotics in the management of these infections. prevention requires strengthening of oral health in the community.
