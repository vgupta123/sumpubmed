BACKGROUND
degenerative lumbosacral stenosis is a common problem in large breed dogs. for severe degenerative lumbosacral stenosis, conservative treatment is often not effective and surgical intervention remains as the last treatment option. the objective of this retrospective study was to assess the middle to long term outcome of treatment of severe degenerative lumbosacral stenosis with pedicle screw-rod fixation with or without evidence of radiological discospondylitis.


RESULTS
twelve client-owned dogs with severe degenerative lumbosacral stenosis underwent pedicle screw-rod fixation of the lumbosacral junction. during long term follow-up, dogs were monitored by clinical evaluation, diagnostic imaging, force plate analysis, and by using questionnaires to owners.

clinical evaluation, force plate data, and responses to questionnaires completed by the owners showed resolution  or improvement  of clinical signs after pedicle screw-rod fixation in  <dig> dogs. there were no implant failures, however, no interbody vertebral bone fusion of the lumbosacral junction was observed in the follow-up period. four dogs developed mild recurrent low back pain that could easily be controlled by pain medication and an altered exercise regime.


CONCLUSIONS
pedicle screw-rod fixation offers a surgical treatment option for large breed dogs with severe degenerative lumbosacral stenosis with or without evidence of radiological discospondylitis in which no other treatment is available. pedicle screw-rod fixation alone does not result in interbody vertebral bone fusion between l <dig> and s <dig>
