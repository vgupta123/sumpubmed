BACKGROUND
insulin stimulates exocytosis of glut <dig> from an intracellular store to the cell surface of fat and muscle cells. fusion of glut4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane requires the snare proteins syntaxin  <dig>  vamp <dig> and the regulatory sec1/munc <dig> protein, munc18c. syntaxin  <dig> and munc18c form a complex that is disrupted upon insulin treatment of adipocytes. munc18c is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin in these cells. here, we directly test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c is responsible for the observed insulin-dependent abrogation of binding between munc18c and syntaxin  <dig> 


RESULTS
we show that munc18c is directly phosphorylated by recombinant insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in vitro. using pull-down assays, we show that phosphorylation abrogates binding of munc18c to both syntaxin  <dig> and the v-snare vamp <dig>  as does the introduction of a phosphomimetic mutation into munc18c .


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c impairs the ability of munc18c to bind its cognate snare proteins, and may therefore represent a regulatory step in glut <dig> traffic.
