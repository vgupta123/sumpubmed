BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are an attractive source of adult stem cells for therapeutic application in clinical study. genetic modification of mscs with beneficial genes makes them more effective for therapeutic use. however, it is difficult to transduce genes into mscs by common transfection methods, especially nonviral methods. in this study, we applied microporation technology as a novel electroporation technique to introduce enhanced green fluorescent protein  and brain-derived neurotropfic factor  plasmid dna into human umbilical cord blood-derived mscs  with significant efficiency, and investigated the stem cell potentiality of engineered mscs through their phenotypes, proliferative capacity, ability to differentiate into multiple lineages, and migration ability towards malignant glioma cells.


RESULTS
using microporation with egfp as a reporter gene, hucb-mscs were transfected with higher efficiency  and only minimal cell damage than when conventional liposome-based reagent  or established electroporation methods were used . more importantly, microporation did not affect the immunophenotype of hucb-mscs, their proliferation activity, ability to differentiate into mesodermal and ectodermal lineages, or migration ability towards cancer cells. in addition, the bdnf gene could be successfully transfected into hucb-mscs, and bdnf expression remained fairly constant for the first  <dig> weeks in vitro and in vivo. moreover, microporation of bdnf gene into hucb-mscs promoted their in vitro differentiation into neural cells.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the present data demonstrates the value of microporation as an efficient means of transfection of mscs without changing their multiple properties. gene delivery by microporation may enhance the feasibility of transgenic stem cell therapy.
