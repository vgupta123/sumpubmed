BACKGROUND
long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  is associated with a reduced incidence of alzheimer's disease . we and others have shown that certain nsaids reduce secretion of aβ <dig> in cell culture and animal models, and that the effect of nsaids on aβ <dig> is independent of the inhibition of cyclooxygenase by these compounds. since aβ <dig> is hypothesized to be the initiating pathologic molecule in ad, the ability of these compounds to lower aβ <dig> selectively may be associated with their protective effect. we have previously identified r-flurbiprofen  as a selective aβ <dig> lowering agent with greatly reduced cyclooxygenase activity that shows promise for testing this hypothesis. in this study we report the effect of chronic r-flurbiprofen treatment on cognition and aβ loads in tg <dig> app mice.


RESULTS
a four-month preventative treatment regimen with r-flurbiprofen  was administered to young tg <dig> mice prior to robust plaque or aβ pathology. this treatment regimen improved spatial learning as assessed by the morris water maze, indicated by an increased spatial bias during the third probe trial and an increased utilization of a place strategy to solve the water maze. these results are consistent with an improvement in hippocampal- and medial temporal lobe-dependent memory function. a modest, though not statistically significant, reduction in formic acid-soluble levels of aβ was also observed. to determine if r-flurbiprofen could reverse cognitive deficits in tg <dig> mice where plaque pathology was already robust, a two-week therapeutic treatment was given to older tg <dig> mice with the same dose of r-flurbiprofen. this approach resulted in a significant decrease in aβ plaque burden but no significant improvement in spatial learning.


CONCLUSIONS
we have found that chronic administration of r-flurbiprofen is able to attenuate spatial learning deficits if given prior to plaque deposition in tg <dig> mice. given its ability to selectively target aβ <dig> production and improve cognitive impairments in transgenic app mice, as well as promising data from a phase  <dig> human clinical trial, future studies are needed to investigate the utility of r-flurbiprofen as an ad therapeutic and its possible mechanisms of action.
