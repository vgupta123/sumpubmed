BACKGROUND
to understand and reduce the concomitant effects of trapping and handling procedures in wildlife species, it is essential to measure their physiological impact. here, we examined individual variation in stress levels in non-anesthetized european roe deer , which were captured in box traps and physically restrained for tagging, biometrics and bio-sampling. in winter  <dig>  we collected venous blood samples from  <dig> individuals during  <dig> capture events and evaluated standard measurements for stress . additionally, we assessed stress using the immunological tool, leukocyte coping capacity , a real-time proxy for stress measuring oxygen radical production by leukocytes. finally, the behavioral response to handling was recorded using a scoring system.


RESULTS
lcc and therefore stress levels were negatively influenced by the time animals spent in the box trap with human presence at the capture site prior to handling. in contrast, none of the classical stress measures, including total cortisol, nor the behavioral assessment, were correlated with the stressor tested  and thus did not provide a clear depiction regarding the extent of the animals short-term stress response.


CONCLUSIONS
overall our study verifies the lcc as a strong method to quantify short-term stress reactions in wildlife. moreover, our results clearly show that human presence at the trapping site prior to handling should be kept to an absolute minimum in order to reduce stress levels.
