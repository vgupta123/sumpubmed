BACKGROUND
phyloinformatic analyses involve large amounts of data and metadata of complex structure. collecting, processing, analyzing, visualizing and summarizing these data and metadata should be done in steps that can be automated and reproduced. this requires flexible, modular toolkits that can represent, manipulate and persist phylogenetic data and metadata as objects with programmable interfaces.


RESULTS
this paper presents bio::phylo, a perl <dig> toolkit for phyloinformatic analysis. it implements classes and methods that are compatible with the well-known bioperl toolkit, but is independent from it  and features a richer api and a data model that is better able to manage the complex relationships between different fundamental data and metadata objects in phylogenetics. it supports commonly used file formats for phylogenetic data including the novel nexml standard, which allows rich annotations of phylogenetic data to be stored and shared. bio::phylo can interact with bioperl, thereby giving access to the file formats that bioperl supports. many methods for data simulation, transformation and manipulation, the analysis of tree shape, and tree visualization are provided.


CONCLUSIONS
bio::phylo is composed of  <dig> richly documented perl <dig> modules. it has been deployed successfully on a variety of computer architectures . it is available as open source  software from http://search.cpan.org/dist/bio-phylo
