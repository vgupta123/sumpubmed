BACKGROUND
the nuclear orphan receptor nur <dig>  has been shown to modulate the inflammatory response of macrophages. to further elucidate the role of nur <dig> in macrophage physiology, we compared the transcriptome of bone marrow-derived macrophages  from wild-type  and nur77-knockout  mice.


RESULTS
in line with previous observations, sdf-1α  was among the most upregulated genes in nur77-deficient bmm and we demonstrated that nur <dig> binds directly to the sdf-1α promoter, resulting in inhibition of sdf-1α expression. the cytokine receptor cx3cr <dig> was strongly downregulated in nur77-ko bmm, implying involvement of nur <dig> in macrophage tolerance. ingenuity pathway analyses  to identify canonical pathways regulation and gene set enrichment analyses  revealed a potential role for nur <dig> in extracellular matrix homeostasis. nur77-deficiency increased the collagen content of macrophage extracellular matrix through enhanced expression of several collagen subtypes and diminished matrix metalloproteinase - <dig> activity. ipa upstream regulator analyses discerned the small gtpase rac <dig> as a novel regulator of nur77-mediated gene expression. we identified an inhibitory feedback loop with increased rac <dig> activity in nur77-ko bmm, which may explain the augmented phagocytic activity of these cells. finally, we predict multiple chronic inflammatory diseases to be influenced by macrophage nur <dig> expression. gsea and ipa associated nur <dig> to osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and allergic airway inflammatory diseases.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether these data identify nur <dig> as a modulator of macrophage function and an interesting target to treat chronic inflammatory disease.
