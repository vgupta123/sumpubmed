BACKGROUND
the asian origin of native americans is largely accepted. however uncertainties persist regarding the source population within asia, the divergence and arrival time of the founder groups, the number of expansion events, and migration routes into the new world. mtdna data, presented over the past two decades, have been used to suggest a single-migration model for which the beringian land mass plays an important role.


RESULTS
in our analysis of  <dig> mitochondrial genomes, the coalescent age estimates of shared roots between native american and siberian-asian lineages, calculated using two different mutation rates, are a <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and d4e <dig> . the coalescent age estimates of pan-american haplogroups calculated using the same two mutation rates  and estimates of population expansions within america , support the pre-clovis occupation of the new world. the phylogeography of sublineages within american haplogroups a <dig>  b <dig>  d <dig> and the c1b, c1c andc1d subhaplogroups of c <dig> are complex and largely specific to geographical north, central and south america. however some sub-branches  already existed in american founder haplogroups before expansion into the america.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that native american founders diverged from their siberian-asian progenitors sometime during the last glacial maximum  and expanded into america soon after the lgm peak . the phylogeography of haplogroup c <dig> suggest that this american founder haplogroup differentiated in siberia-asia. the situation is less clear for haplogroup b <dig>  however haplogroups a <dig> and d <dig> may have differentiated soon after the native american founders divergence. a moderate population bottle neck in american founder populations just before the expansion most plausibly resulted in few founder types in america. the similar estimates of the diversity indices and bayesian skyline analysis in north america, central america and south america suggest almost simultaneous  colonization of these geographical regions with rapid population expansion differentiating into more or less regional branches across the pan-american haplogroups.
