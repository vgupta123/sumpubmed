BACKGROUND
top-down mass spectrometry plays an important role in intact protein identification and characterization. top-down mass spectra are more complex than bottom-up mass spectra because they often contain many isotopomer envelopes from highly charged ions, which may overlap with one another. as a result, spectral deconvolution, which converts a complex top-down mass spectrum into a monoisotopic mass list, is a key step in top-down spectral interpretation.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a new scoring function, l-score, for evaluating isotopomer envelopes. by combining l-score with ms-deconv, a new software tool, ms-deconv+, was developed for top-down spectral deconvolution. experimental results showed that ms-deconv+ outperformed existing software tools in top-down spectral deconvolution.


CONCLUSIONS
l-score shows high discriminative ability in identification of isotopomer envelopes. using l-score, ms-deconv+ reports many correct monoisotopic masses missed by other software tools, which are valuable for proteoform identification and characterization.
