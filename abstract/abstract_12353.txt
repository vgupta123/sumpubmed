BACKGROUND
‘candidatus liberibacter solanacearum’  is a phloem-limited alphaproteobacterium associated with the devastating zebra chip disease of potato . like other members of liberibacter, lso-zc <dig> encodes a flagellin domain-containing protein  with a conserved  <dig> amino-acid peptide . to understand the innate immune responses triggered by this unculturable intracellular bacterium, we studied the pathogen-associated molecular patterns  that triggered immunity in nicotiana benthamiana, using the flg22lso peptide and the full length flalso gene.


RESULTS
our results showed that the expression of flalso via agrobacterium-mediated transient expression induced a slow necrotic cell death in the inoculated leaves of n. benthamiana, which was coupled with a burst of reactive oxygen species  production. moreover, the expression of several representative genes involved in innate immunity was transiently up-regulated by the flg22lso in n. benthamiana. the flalso, however, induced stronger up-regulation of these representative genes compared to the flg22lso, especially that of flagellin receptor flagellin sensing <dig>  and respiratory burst oxidase  in n. benthamiana. although neither cell death nor ros were induced by the synthetic flg22lso, a weak callose deposition was observed in infiltrated leaves of tobacco, tomato, and potato plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the flagellin of lso and its functional domain, flg22lso share characteristics of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and trigger unique innate immune responses in n. benthamiana. slow and weak activation of the innate immune response in host plants by the flagellin of lso may reflect the nature of its intracellular life cycle. our findings provide new insights into the role of the lso flagellin in the development of potato zebra chip disease and potential application in breeding for resistance.
