BACKGROUND
brisken et al  showed that wnt <dig> null mammary glands were deficient in early lobuloalveolar mammary outgrowth during pregnancy, and implicated wnt <dig> as an effector for the progesterone-induced mammary growth program. though ectopic wnt <dig> signaling is known to be mitogenic and oncogenic, no endogenously expressed wnt ligands have ever been directly implicated in mammary growth and morphogenesis. therefore, we generated conditional transgenic mice to test whether wnt <dig> can stimulate mammary epithelial cell growth.


RESULTS
we found that despite pregnancy-associated expression levels of wnt <dig>  mammary glands did not display the side-branching typical of early pregnancy. control experiments designed to test the wnt <dig> construct in zebrafish reproduced other studies that demonstrated wnt4-specific phenotypes distinct from wnt1-induced phenotypes. indeed, using qpcr-based array analyses, we found that a specific transcriptional target of wnt <dig>  namely wnt <dig>  was induced in wnt4-expressing transgenic glands, to levels equivalent to that of early pregnant glands.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we propose that wnt <dig> is necessary, but not sufficient, to induce side-branch development.
