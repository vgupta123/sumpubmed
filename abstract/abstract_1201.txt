BACKGROUND
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  is an important cause of bloody diarrhoea , non-bloody diarrhoea  and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome . in argentina and new zealand, the most prevalent stec serotype is o157:h <dig>  which is responsible for the majority of hus cases. in australia, on the other hand, stec o157:h <dig> is associated with a minority of hus cases. the main aims of this study were to compare the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of stec o <dig> strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from humans in argentina, australia and new zealand, and to establish their clonal relatedness.


RESULTS
seventy-three o <dig> stec strains, isolated from hus , bd , nbd , or unspecified conditions  in argentina, australia and new zealand, were analysed. the strains were confirmed to be e. coli o <dig> by biochemical tests and serotyping. a multiplex polymerase chain reaction  was used to amplify the stx <dig>  stx <dig> and rfbo <dig> genes and a genotyping method based on pcr-rflp was used to determine stx <dig> and stx <dig> variants. this analysis revealed that the most frequent stx genotypes were stx2/stx2c   in argentina, stx <dig>  in new zealand, and stx1/stx <dig>  in australia. no stx1-postive strains were identified in argentina or new zealand. all strains harboured the eae gene and  <dig> strains produced enterohaemolysin . the clonal relatedness of strains was investigated by phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . the most frequent phage types  identified in argentinian, australian, and new zealand strains were pt <dig> , pt <dig> , and pt <dig> , respectively. forty-six different patterns were obtained by xbai-pfge;  <dig> strains were grouped in  <dig> clusters and  <dig> strains showed unique patterns. most clusters could be further subdivided by blni-pfge.


CONCLUSIONS
stec o <dig> strains isolated in argentina, australia, and new zealand differed from each other in terms of stx-genotype and phage type. additionally, no common pfge patterns were found in strains isolated in the three countries. international collaborative studies of the type reported here are needed to detect and monitor potentially hypervirulent stec clones.
