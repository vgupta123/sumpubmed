BACKGROUND
promyelocytic leukemia protein  is a tumor suppressor that is highly expressed in endothelial cells nonetheless its role in endothelial cell biology remains elusive. tumor necrosis factor alpha  is an important cytokine associated with many inflammation-related diseases. we have previously demonstrated that tnfα induces pml protein accumulation. we hypothesized that pml may play a role in tnfα signaling pathway. to identify potential pml target genes and investigate the putative crosstalk between pml’s function and tnfα signaling in endothelial cells, we carried out a microarray analysis in human primary umbilical endothelial cells .


RESULTS
we found that pml and tnfα regulate common and distinct genes involved in a similar spectrum of biological processes, pathways and human diseases. more importantly, we found that pml is required for fine-tuning of tnfα-mediated immune and inflammatory responses. furthermore, our data suggest that pml and tnfα synergistically regulate cell adhesion by engaging multiple molecular mechanisms. our biological functional assays exemplified that adhesion of u <dig> human leukocytes to huvecs is co-regulated by pml and tnfα signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our study identified pml as an essential regulator of tnfα signaling by revealing the crosstalk between pml knockdown-mediated effects and tnfα-elicited signaling, thereby providing novel insights into tnfα signaling in endothelial cells.
