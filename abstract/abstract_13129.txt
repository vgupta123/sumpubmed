BACKGROUND
the runx <dig> transcription factor gene is frequently mutated in sporadic myeloid and lymphoid leukemia through translocation, point mutation or amplification. it is also responsible for a familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia . the disruption of the largely unknown biological pathways controlled by runx <dig> is likely to be responsible for the development of leukemia. we have used multiple microarray platforms and bioinformatic techniques to help identify these biological pathways to aid in the understanding of why runx <dig> mutations lead to leukemia.


RESULTS
here we report genes regulated either directly or indirectly by runx <dig> based on the study of gene expression profiles generated from  <dig> different human and mouse platforms. the platforms used were global gene expression profiling of: 1) cell lines with runx <dig> mutations from fpd-aml patients, 2) over-expression of runx <dig> and cbfβ, and 3) runx <dig> knockout mouse embryos using either cdna or affymetrix microarrays. we observe that our datasets  significantly correlate with published microarray data from sporadic aml patients with mutations in either runx <dig> or its cofactor, cbfβ. a number of biological processes were identified among the differentially expressed genes and functional assays suggest that heterozygous runx <dig> point mutations in patients with fpd-aml impair cell proliferation, microtubule dynamics and possibly genetic stability. in addition, analysis of the regulatory regions of the differentially expressed genes has for the first time systematically identified numerous potential novel runx <dig> target genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this work is the first large-scale study attempting to identify the genetic networks regulated by runx <dig>  a master regulator in the development of the hematopoietic system and leukemia. the biological pathways and target genes controlled by runx <dig> will have considerable importance in disease progression in both familial and sporadic leukemia as well as therapeutic implications.
