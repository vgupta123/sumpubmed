BACKGROUND
parthenocarpy is an important trait for yield and quality in many plants. but due to its complex interactions with genetic and physiological factors, it has not been adequately understood and applied to breeding and production. finding novel and effective quantitative trait loci  is a critical step towards understanding its genetic mechanism. cucumber  is a typical parthenocarpic plant but the qtls controlling parthenocarpy in cucumber were not mapped on chromosomes, and the linked markers were neither user-friendly nor confirmed by previous studies. hence, we conducted a two-season qtl study of parthenocarpy based on the cucumber genome with 145 f2: <dig> families derived from a cross between ec <dig>  and 8419 s- <dig>  in order to map novel qtls. whole genome re-sequencing was also performed both to develop effective linked markers and to predict candidate genes.


RESULTS
a genetic linkage map, employing  <dig> simple sequence repeats  markers and nine insertion/deletion  markers spanning  <dig>  cm on seven chromosomes, was constructed from an f <dig> population. seven novel qtls were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  parthenocarpy  <dig>  , a qtl on chromosome  <dig>  was a major-effect qtl with a logarithm of odds  score of  <dig>  and phenotypic variance explained  of  <dig>  % in the spring season and with a lod score of  <dig>  and pve of  <dig>  % in the fall season. we confirmed this qtl using a residual heterozygous line97- <dig> . effectiveness of linked markers of the parth <dig>  was validated in f3: <dig> population and in  <dig> inbred lines. within this region, there were  <dig> genes with nonsynonymous snps/indels in the coding sequence. based on further combined analysis with transcriptome data between two parents, csarf <dig>  cswd <dig>  csein <dig>  csppr, cshexo <dig>  csmdl, csdjc <dig> and cssmax <dig> were predicted as potential candidate genes controlling parthenocarpy.


CONCLUSIONS
a major-effect qtl parth <dig>  and six minor-effect qtls mainly contribute to the genetic architecture of parthenocarpy in cucumber. ssr <dig> and indel-t- <dig> can be used in marker-assisted selection  of cucumber breeding. whole genome re-sequencing enhances the efficiency of polymorphic marker development and prediction of candidate genes.
