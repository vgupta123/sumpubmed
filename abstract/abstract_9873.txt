BACKGROUND
although several attempts have been made to control enzootic bovine leukosis  at the local level, a nationwide control program has not been implemented in japan, except for passive surveillance. effective control of ebl requires that the transmission routes of bovine leukemia virus  infection should be identified and intercepted based on scientific evidence. in this cross-sectional study, we examined the risk factors associated with within-herd transmission of blv on infected dairy farms in japan. blood samples taken from  <dig> randomly selected adult cows at each of  <dig> dairy farms were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . information on herd management was collected using a structured questionnaire.


RESULTS
infected farms were defined as those with more than one elisa-positive animal and accounted for  <dig>  of the  <dig> farms in the study. completed questionnaires obtained from  <dig> of these  <dig> farms were used for statistical analysis. seroprevalence, which was defined as the proportions of animals that tested positive out of all animals tested on the farm, was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively. a mixed logistic regression analysis implicated a loose housing system, dehorning, and a large number of horseflies in summer as risk factors  and feeding of colostrum to newborn calves from their dams as a protective factor  against within-farm transmission of blv on infected farms.


CONCLUSIONS
control of ebl in infected dairy farms in japan will be improved by focusing particularly on these risk and protective factors.
