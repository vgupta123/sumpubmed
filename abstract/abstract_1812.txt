BACKGROUND
the degree of postcopulatory sexual selection, comprising variable degrees of sperm competition and cryptic female choice, is an important evolutionary force to influence sperm form and function. here we investigated the effects of mating system and spawning location on the evolution of sperm morphology in  <dig> species of chinese anurans. we also examined how relative testes size as an indicator of the level of sperm competition affected variation in sperm morphology across a subset of  <dig> species.


RESULTS
we found a significant association of mating system and spawning location with sperm morphology. however, when removing the effects of body mass or absolute testes mass for species for which such data were available, this effect became non-significant. consistent with predictions from sperm competition theory, we found a positive correlation between sperm morphology and relative testes size after taking phylogeny into account.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that sexual selection in chinese anurans favors longer sperm when the level of sperm competition is high. pre-copulatory male-male competition and spawning location, on the other hand, do not affect the evolution of sperm morphology after taking body mass and absolute testes mass into account.
