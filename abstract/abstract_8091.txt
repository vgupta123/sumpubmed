BACKGROUND
neph <dig>  is expressed in the glomerular podocytes where it localizes at the specialized cell adhesion structures of the foot processes called slit diaphragms which form the outermost layer of the glomerular filtration barrier. neph <dig> protein shows homology and structural similarity to neph <dig>  neph <dig> and nephrin, which all are crucial for maintaining the normal glomerular ultrafiltration function. the exact function of neph <dig> in the kidney is not known but we have previously shown that the level of neph <dig> mrna is decreased in proteinuric diseases. this suggests that neph <dig> may play a role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage, and emphasizes the need to analyze the regulatory mechanisms of neph <dig> gene. in this study we investigated the transcriptional regulation of neph <dig> gene by identifying transcription factors that control neph <dig> expression.


RESULTS
we cloned and characterized approximately  <dig> kb fragment upstream of the neph <dig> gene. neph <dig> proximal promoter near the transcription start site was found to be devoid of tata and caat boxes, but to contain a highly gc-rich area. using promoter reporter gene constructs, we localized the main activating regulatory region of neph <dig> gene in its proximal promoter region from - <dig> to - <dig>  within this region, putative transcription factor binding sites for nf-κb and sp <dig> were found by computational analysis. mutational screening indicated that nf-κb and sp <dig> response elements are essential for the basal transcriptional activity of the neph <dig> promoter. co-transfection studies further showed that nf-κb and sp <dig> regulate neph <dig> promoter activity. in addition, overexpression of nf-κb increased endogenous neph <dig> gene expression. chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using cultured human podocytes demonstrated that both nf-κb and sp <dig> interact with the neph <dig> promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that nf-κb and sp <dig> are key regulators of neph <dig> expression at the basal level in podocytes, therefore providing new insight into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the expression of neph <dig> gene.
