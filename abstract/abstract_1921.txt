BACKGROUND
hemojuvelin  is one of essential components for expression of hepcidin, a hormone which regulates iron transport. hjv is mainly expressed in muscle and liver, and processing of hjv in both tissues is similar. however, hepcidin is expressed in liver but not in muscle and the role of the muscle hjv is yet to be established. our preliminary analyses of mouse tissue hjv showed that the apparent molecular masses of hjv peptides are different in liver  and in muscle . one possible explanation is glycosylation which could lead to difference in molecular mass.


RESULTS
we investigated glycosylation of hjv in both liver and muscle tissue from mice. pngase f treatment revealed that the hjv large fragments of liver and muscle were digested to peptides with similar masses,  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively, and the liver  <dig> kda small fragment of heterodimer was digested to  <dig> kda, while the  <dig> kda liver and  <dig> kda muscle monomers were reduced to  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively. endo h treatment produced distinct digestion profiles of the large fragment: a small fraction of the  <dig> kda peptide was reduced to  <dig> kda in liver, while the majority of the  <dig> kda peptide was digested to  <dig> kda and a very small fraction to  <dig> kda in muscle. in addition, liver hjv was found to be neuraminidase-sensitive but its muscle counterpart was neuraminidase-resistant.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that different oligosaccharides are attached to liver and muscle hjv peptides, which may contribute to different functions of hjv in the two tissues.
