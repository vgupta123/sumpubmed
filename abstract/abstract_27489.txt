BACKGROUND
availability of the draft nuclear genome sequences of small-seeded desi-type legume crop cicer arietinum has provided an opportunity for investigating unique chickpea genomic features and evaluation of their biological significance. the increasing number of legume genome sequences also presents a challenge for developing reliable and information-driven bioinformatics applications suitable for comparative exploration of this important class of crop plants.


RESULTS
the chickpea genomic web resource  is an implementation of a suite of web-based applications dedicated to chickpea genome visualization and comparative analysis, based on next generation sequencing and assembly of cicer arietinum desi-type genotype icc <dig>  cgwr has been designed and configured for mapping, scanning and browsing the significant chickpea genomic features in view of the important existing and potential roles played by the various legume genome projects in mutant mapping and cloning. it also enables comparative informatics of icc <dig> dna sequence analysis with other wild and cultivated genotypes of chickpea, various other leguminous species as well as several non-leguminous model plants, to enable investigations into evolutionary processes that shape legume genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
cgwr is an online database offering a comprehensive visual and functional genomic analysis of the chickpea genome, along with customized maps and gene-clustering options. it is also the only plant based web resource supporting display and analysis of nucleosome positioning patterns in the genome. the usefulness of cgwr has been demonstrated with discoveries of biological significance made using this server. the cgwr is compatible with all available operating systems and browsers, and is available freely under the open source license at http://www.nipgr.res.in/cgwr/home.php.
