BACKGROUND
melon  fruits exhibit phenotypic diversity in several key quality determinants such as taste, color and aroma. sucrose, carotenoids and volatiles are recognized as the key compounds shaping the above corresponding traits yet the full network of biochemical events underlying their synthesis have not been comprehensively described. to delineate the cellular processes shaping fruit quality phenotypes, a population of recombinant inbred lines  was used as a source of phenotypic and genotypic variations. in parallel, ripe fruits were analyzed for both the quantified level of  <dig> metabolic traits directly associated with fruit quality and for rna-seq based expression profiles generated for  <dig>  unigenes. first, we explored inter-metabolite association patterns; then, we described metabolites versus gene association patterns; finally, we used the correlation-based associations for predicting uncharacterized synthesis pathways.


RESULTS
based on metabolite versus metabolite and metabolite versus gene association patterns, we divided metabolites into two key groups: a group including ethylene and aroma determining volatiles whose accumulation patterns are correlated with the expression of genes involved in the glycolysis and tca cycle pathways; and a group including sucrose and color determining carotenoids whose accumulation levels are correlated with the expression of genes associated with plastid formation.


CONCLUSIONS
the study integrates multiple processes into a genome scale perspective of cellular activity. this lays a foundation for deciphering the role of gene markers associated with the determination of fruit quality traits.
