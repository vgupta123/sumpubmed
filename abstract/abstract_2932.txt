BACKGROUND
recent developments of high-density snp chips across a number of species require accurate genetic maps. despite rapid advances in genome sequence assembly and availability of a number of tools for creating genetic maps, the exact genome location for a number of snps from these snp chips still remains unknown. we have developed a locus ordering procedure based on linkage disequilibrium  which provides estimation of the chromosomal positions of unaligned snps and scaffolds. it also provides an alternative means for verification of genetic maps. we exemplified lode in cattle.


RESULTS
the utility of the lode procedure was demonstrated using data from  <dig>  bulls genotyped for  <dig>  snps across three different snp chips. first, the utility of the procedure was tested by analysing the masked positions of  <dig>  randomly-chosen snps with known locations , representing three classes of minor allele frequencies , namely > <dig> ,  <dig> <maf ≤  <dig>  and  <dig> <maf ≤  <dig> . the efficiency  was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %; with an accuracy  of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the three classes of maf, respectively. the average precision for placement of the snps was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. secondly,  <dig>  of  <dig>  snps unpositioned in the btau <dig>  assembly were positioned using the lode procedure. based on these results, the positions of  <dig> unordered scaffolds were determined. the procedure was also used to validate the genome positions of  <dig>  snps placed on btau <dig>  bovine assembly, resulting in identification of problem areas in the assembly. finally, the accuracy of the lode procedure was independently validated by comparative mapping on the hg <dig> human assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
the lode procedure described in this study is an efficient and accurate method for positioning snps , for validating and checking the quality of a genome assembly, and offers a means for positioning of unordered scaffolds containing snps. the lode procedure will be helpful in refining genome sequence assemblies, especially those being created from next-generation sequencing where high-throughput snp discovery and genotyping platforms are integrated components of genome analysis.
