BACKGROUND
rational design of aav capsids is a simple method for enhancing aav transduction efficiency. aav-dj is a highly recombinogenic hybrid vector created from dna shuffling of eight aav serotypes, which mediates efficient gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. aav <dig> and aav <dig> are the closest parental vectors of aav-dj and it has been reported that mutations on the 137/251/ <dig> ubiquitination or phosphorylation sites of the aav <dig> or aav <dig> capsid lead to dramatic enhancement of gene delivery. here, we aimed to find out whether the same point mutations on the aav-dj capsid could lead to significant improvement for gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
we constructed three single point mutants  of aav-dj and the transduction efficiency of these mutants and aav-dj were investigated using two reporter gene systems including green fluorescent protein  and dual-luciferase . data indicated that single point mutations t251a/s503a lead to significant improvement of dual-luciferase expression in vivo after tail vein  injection in mice respectively, despite limited enhancement of gfp expression in 293 t, hela and hepg <dig> cells in vitro. moreover, in vivo bioluminescence image and viral genome dna copy number in tissue analysis showed that these mutants reserved the liver tropism characteristics, consistent with aav-dj.


CONCLUSIONS
single point mutations on the 251/ <dig> sites of aav-dj capsid can lead to a significant improvement for in vivo gene expression. these enhanced aav vectors have great potential in gene therapy applications.
