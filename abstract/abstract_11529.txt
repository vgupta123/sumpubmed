BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen worldwide that causes meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and endocarditis. using animal models, a surface-associated subtilisin-like protease  has recently been shown to be an important virulence factor for s. suis. in this study, we hypothesized that the s. suis sspa subtilisin-like protease may modulate cytokine secretion by macrophages thus contributing to the pathogenic process of meningitis.


RESULTS
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated u <dig> macrophages were stimulated with recombinant sspa prior to monitor cytokine secretion by elisa. our results indicated that the recombinant sspa was able to dose-dependently induce il-1β, il- <dig>  tnf-α, cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> secretion in macrophages. the heat-inactivated protease was still able to induce cytokine secretion suggesting a non-proteolytic mechanism of macrophage activation. using specific kinase inhibitors, evidence were bought that cytokine secretion by macrophages stimulated with the recombinant sspa involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. while stimulation of macrophages with low concentrations of recombinant sspa was associated to secretion of high amounts of ccl <dig>  the use of recombinant sspa at a high concentration resulted in low amounts of ccl <dig> detected in the conditioned medium. this was found to be associated with a proteolytic degradation of ccl <dig> by sspa. the ability of sspa to induce cytokine secretion in macrophages was confirmed using a mutant of s. suis deficient in sspa expression.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study identified a new mechanism by which the s. suis sspa may promote central nervous system inflammation associated with meningitis.
