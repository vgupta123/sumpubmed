BACKGROUND
iron deficiency induces in strategy i plants physiological, biochemical and molecular modifications capable to increase iron uptake from the rhizosphere. this effort needs a reorganization of metabolic pathways to efficiently sustain activities linked to the acquisition of iron; in fact, carbohydrates and the energetic metabolism has been shown to be involved in these responses. the aim of this work was to find both a confirmation of the already expected change in the enzyme concentrations induced in cucumber root tissue in response to iron deficiency as well as to find new insights on the involvement of other pathways.


RESULTS
the proteome pattern of soluble cytosolic proteins extracted from roots was obtained by 2-de. of about two thousand spots found, only those showing at least a two-fold increase or decrease in the concentration were considered for subsequent identification by mass spectrometry. fifty-seven proteins showed significant changes, and  <dig> of them were identified. twenty-one of them were increased in quantity, whereas  <dig> were decreased in quantity. most of the increased proteins belong to glycolysis and nitrogen metabolism in agreement with the biochemical evidence. on the other hand, the proteins being decreased belong to the metabolism of sucrose and complex structural carbohydrates and to structural proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
the new available techniques allow to cast new light on the mechanisms involved in the changes occurring in plants under iron deficiency. the data obtained from this proteomic study confirm the metabolic changes occurring in cucumber as a response to fe deficiency. two main conclusions may be drawn. the first one is the confirmation of the increase in the glycolytic flux and in the anaerobic metabolism to sustain the energetic effort the fe-deficient plants must undertake. the second conclusion is, on one hand, the decrease in the amount of enzymes linked to the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates of the cell wall, and, on the other hand, the increase in enzymes linked to the turnover of proteins.
