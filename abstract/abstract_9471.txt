BACKGROUND
heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans are diverse components of certain proteoglycans and are known to interact with growth factors as a co-receptor necessary to induce signalling and growth factor activity. in this report we characterize heterogeneously glycosylated recombinant human perlecan domain  <dig>  synthesized in either hek  <dig> cells or huvecs by transient gene delivery using either adenoviral or expression plasmid technology.


RESULTS
by sds-page analysis following anion exchange chromatography, the recombinant proteoglycans appeared to possess glycosaminoglycan chains ranging, in total, from  <dig> kda to > <dig> kda per recombinant. immunoblot analysis of enzyme-digested high mr rhpln.d <dig> demonstrated that the rhpln.d <dig> was synthesized as either a chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in an approximately 2: <dig> ratio, with negligible hybrids. secondary structure analysis suggested helices and sheets in both recombinant species. rhpln.d <dig> demonstrated binding to rhfgf- <dig> with an apparent kd of  <dig> Â±  <dig>  nm with almost complete susceptibility to digestion by heparinase iii in ligand blot analysis but not to chondroitinase digestion. additionally, we demonstrate hs-mediated binding of both rhpln.d <dig> species to several other gfs. finally, we corroborate the augmentation of fgf-mediated cell activation by rhpln.d <dig> and demonstrate mitogenic signalling through the fgfr1c receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
with importance especially to the emerging field of dna-based therapeutics, we have shown here that proteoglycan synthesis, in different cell lines where gag profiles typically differ, can be directed by recombinant technology to produce populations of bioactive recombinants with highly similar gag profiles.
