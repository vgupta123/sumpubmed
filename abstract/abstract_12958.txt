BACKGROUND
during june-july  <dig>  six imipenem-resistant escherichia coli isolates were isolated from two patients hospitalized in a ward of one large tertiary-care hospital in genoa, italy. genetic features associated with blandm- <dig> gene were investigated.


RESULTS
the isolates exhibited the same pfge profile and a multidrug-resistant  phenotype to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and Î²-lactams. the strains produced the ndm- <dig> carbapenemase and the blandm- <dig> gene was part of the variable region of a class  <dig> integron. mlst analysis revealed that all isolates belonged to sequence type  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on the emergence of an mdr strain of e.coli producing the ndm- <dig> mbl in italy.
