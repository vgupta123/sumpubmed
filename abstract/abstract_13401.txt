BACKGROUND
the transcription factor e2f <dig> controls proliferation of normal and cancerous intestinal epithelial cells. e2f <dig> localization in normal human intestinal epithelial cells  is cell cycle-dependent, being cytoplasmic in quiescent differentiated cells but nuclear in proliferative cells. however, the intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating such e2f <dig> localization remain unknown.


RESULTS
treatment of quiescent hiec with serum induced erk1/ <dig> activation, e2f <dig> phosphorylation, e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition while inhibition of mek/erk signaling by u <dig> prevented these events. stimulation of hiec with epidermal growth factor  also led to the activation of erk1/ <dig> but, in contrast to serum or lysophosphatidic acid , egf failed to induce e2f <dig> phosphorylation, e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition. furthermore, akt and gsk3β phosphorylation levels were markedly enhanced in serum- or lpa-stimulated hiec but not by egf. importantly, e2f <dig> phosphorylation, e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition were all observed in response to egf when gsk <dig> activity was concomitantly inhibited by sb <dig>  finally, e2f <dig> was found to be overexpressed, phosphorylated and nuclear localized in epithelial cells from human colorectal adenomas exhibiting mutations in apc and kras or braf genes, known to deregulate gsk3/β-catenin and mek/erk signaling, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results indicate that mek/erk activation and gsk <dig> inhibition are both required for e2f <dig> phosphorylation as well as its nuclear translocation and s phase entry in hiec. this finding suggests that dysregulated e2f <dig> nuclear localization may be an instigating event leading to hyperproliferation and hence, of tumor initiation and promotion in the colon and rectum.
