BACKGROUND
the classification of the musaceae  family species and their phylogenetic inter-relationships remain controversial, in part due to limited nucleotide information to complement the morphological and physiological characters. in this work the evolutionary relationships within the musaceae family were studied using  <dig> species and dna sequences obtained from a set of  <dig> unlinked nuclear genes.


RESULTS
the  <dig> gene sequences represented a sample of ~ <dig> kb of genome sequence . the sequence data were also used to obtain estimates for the divergence times of the musaceae genera and musa sections. nucleotide variation within the sample confirmed the close relationship of australimusa and callimusa sections and showed that eumusa and rhodochlamys sections are not reciprocally monophyletic, which supports the previous claims for the merger between the two latter sections. divergence time analysis supported the previous dating of the musaceae crown age to the cretaceous/tertiary boundary , and the evolution of musa to ~ <dig> mya. the first estimates for the divergence times of the four musa sections were also obtained.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene sequence-based phylogeny presented here provides a substantial insight into the course of speciation within the musaceae. an understanding of the main phylogenetic relationships between banana species will help to fine-tune the taxonomy of musaceae.
