BACKGROUND
two mammary lymphatic cannulation models in sheep have been described with minimal use in the past 50 years. the purpose of this study was to investigate a new surgical technique to allow long term monitoring of mammary lymph flow and composition from the mammary glands, with rapid ewe recovery and minimal complications post-surgery.


RESULTS
we developed a modified methodology for cannulating the efferent mammary lymphatic from the mammary lymph node with minimum tissue damage. compared to the previous models, our method required only a small incision on the aponeurosis of the external abdominal oblique muscles and thus reduced the difficulties in suturing the aponeurosis. it allowed for lymph collection and assessment for at least one week post-surgery with concurrent milk collection.


CONCLUSIONS
this method allows for good ewe recovery post-surgery and in vivo sampling of efferent mammary lymph from the mammary lymph nodes in real-time and comparison with milk parameters.
