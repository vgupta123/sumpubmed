BACKGROUND
mutations in the human polycystic kidney disease- <dig>  gene result in ~85% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the most frequent human monogenic disease. pkd <dig> proteins are large multidomain proteins involved in a variety of signal transduction mechanisms. obtaining more information about members of the pkd <dig> family will help to clarify their functions. humans have five hpkd <dig> proteins, whereas sea urchins have  <dig>  the pkd <dig> proteins of the sea urchin, strongylocentrotus purpuratus, are referred to as the receptor for egg jelly, or sprej proteins. the sprej proteins form a subfamily within the pkd <dig> family. they frequently contain c-type lectin domains, pkd repeats, a rej domain, a gps domain, a plat/lh <dig> domain, 1â€“ <dig> transmembrane segments and a c-terminal coiled-coil domain.


RESULTS
the  <dig> full-length sprej cdna sequences were determined. the secondary structures of their deduced proteins were predicted and compared to the five human hpkd <dig> proteins. the genomic structures of the  <dig> sprejs show low similarity to each other. all  <dig> sprejs are transcribed in either embryos or adult tissues. sprejs show distinct patterns of expression during embryogenesis. adult tissues show tissue-specific patterns of sprej expression.


CONCLUSIONS
possession of a rej domain of about  <dig> residues defines this family. except for sprej <dig> and  <dig>  that are thought to be associated with the sperm acrosome reaction, the functions of the other sprej proteins remain unknown. the sea urchin genome is one-fourth the size of the human genome, but sea urchins have  <dig> sprej proteins, whereas humans have five. determination of the tissue specific function of each of these proteins will be of interest to those studying echinoderm development. sea urchins are basal deuterostomes, the line of evolution leading to the vertebrates. the study of individual pkd <dig> proteins will increase our knowledge of the importance of this gene family.
