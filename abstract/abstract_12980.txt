BACKGROUND
huntingtin-associated protein  <dig>  is expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, and is critical for postnatal survival in mice. hap <dig> shares a conserved “hap1_n” domain with trafficking kinesin proteins trak <dig> and trak <dig> , milton  and t27a <dig>  . hap <dig>  trak <dig> and trak <dig> have a degree of common function, particularly regarding intracellular receptor trafficking. however, trak <dig>  trak <dig> and milton  differ in function to hap <dig> in that they are mitochondrial transport proteins, while hap <dig> has emerging roles in starvation response. we have investigated hap <dig> function by examining its evolution, and upstream gene promoter sequences. we performed phylogenetic analyses of the hap1_n domain family of proteins, incorporating hap <dig> orthologues  from  <dig> vertebrate classes, and also searched the dictyostelium proteome for a common ancestor. computational analyses of mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters were performed to identify phylogenetically conserved regulatory motifs.


RESULTS
we found that as recently as marsupials, hap <dig> contained a milt/trak domain and was more similar to trak <dig> and trak <dig> than to eutherian hap <dig>  the milt/trak domain likely arose post multicellularity, as it was absent in the dictyostelium proteome. it was lost from hap <dig> in the eutherian lineage, and also from t27a <dig>  in c. elegans. the hap <dig> promoter from human, mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, dog, tasmanian devil and opossum contained common sites for transcription factors involved in cell cycle, growth, differentiation, and stress response. a conserved arrangement of regulatory elements was identified, including sites for caudal-related homeobox transcription factors , and myc-associated factor x  in the region of the tata box. cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> are intestine-enriched factors, prompting investigation of hap <dig> protein expression in the human duodenum. hap <dig> was localized to singly dispersed mucosal cells, including a subset of serotonin-positive enterochromaffin cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified eutherian hap <dig> as an evolutionarily recent adaptation of a vertebrate trak protein-like ancestor, and found conserved cdx1/cdx <dig> and max transcription factor binding sites near the tata box in mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters. we also demonstrated that hap <dig> is expressed in endocrine cells of the human gut.
