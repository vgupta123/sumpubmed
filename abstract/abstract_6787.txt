BACKGROUND
hairy and enhancer of split  <dig> , a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor, is a downstream target of notch signaling. notch signaling and hes <dig> expression have been linked to growth and survival in a variety of human cancer types and have been associated with increased metastasis and invasiveness in human osteosarcoma cell lines. osteosarcoma  is an aggressive cancer demonstrating both high metastatic rate and chemotherapeutic resistance. the current study examined expression of notch signaling mediators in primary canine osa tumors and canine and human osteosarcoma cell lines to assess their role in osa development and progression.


RESULTS
reverse transcriptase - quantitative pcr  was utilized to quantify hes <dig>  hey <dig>  notch <dig> and notch <dig> gene expression in matched tumor and normal metaphyseal bone samples taken from dogs treated for appendicular osa at the colorado state university veterinary teaching hospital. gene expression was also assessed in tumors from dogs with a disease free interval  of <100 days compared to those with a dfi > 300 days following treatment with surgical amputation followed by standard chemotherapy. immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm expression of hes <dig>  data from rt-qpcr and immunohistochemical  experiments were analyzed using rest <dig> software and survival analysis based on ihc expression employed the kaplan-meier method and log rank analysis. unbiased clustered images were generated from gene array analysis data for notch/hes <dig> associated genes.

gene array analysis of notch/hes <dig> associated genes suggested alterations in the notch signaling pathway may contribute to the development of canine osa. hes <dig> mrna expression was elevated in tumor samples relative to normal bone, but decreased in tumor samples from dogs with a dfi < 100 days relative to those with a dfi > 300 days. notch <dig> and hey <dig> mrna expression was also elevated in tumors relative to normal bone, but was not differentially expressed between the dfi tumor groups. survival analysis confirmed an association between decreased hes <dig> immunosignal and shorter dfi.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that activation of notch signaling occurs and may contribute to the development of canine osa. however, association of low hes <dig> expression and shorter dfi suggests that mechanisms that do not alter hes <dig> expression may drive the most aggressive tumors.
