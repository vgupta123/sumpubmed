BACKGROUND
the evolution of land plants is characterized by whole genome duplications , which drove species diversification and evolutionary novelties. detecting these events is especially difficult if they date back to the origin of the plant kingdom. established methods for reconstructing wgds include intra- and inter-genome comparisons, ks age distribution analyses, and phylogenetic tree constructions.


RESULTS
by analysing  <dig> completely sequenced plant genomes  <dig> myosins were identified and manually assembled. phylogenetic trees of the myosin motor domains revealed orthologous and paralogous relationships and were consistent with recent species trees. based on the myosin inventories and the phylogenetic trees, we have identified duplications of the entire myosin motor protein family at timings consistent with  <dig> wgds, that had been reported before. we also predict  <dig> wgds based on further protein family duplications. notably, the myosin data support the two recently reported wgds in the common ancestor of all extant angiosperms. we predict single wgds in the manihot esculenta and nicotiana benthamiana lineages, two wgds for linum usitatissimum and phoenix dactylifera, and a triplication or two wgds for gossypium raimondii. our data show another myosin duplication in the ancestor of the angiosperms that could be either the result of a single gene duplication or a remnant of a wgd.


CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the myosin inventories in angiosperms retain evidence of numerous wgds that happened throughout plant evolution. in contrast to other protein families, many myosins are still present in extant species. they are closely related and have similar domain architectures, and their phylogenetic grouping follows the genome duplications. because of its broad taxonomic sampling the dataset provides the basis for reliable future identification of further whole genome duplications.
