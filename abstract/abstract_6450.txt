BACKGROUND
dogs are the most common pet animals worldwide. they may harbour a wide range of parasites with zoonotic potential, thus causing a health risk to humans. in nigeria, epidemiological knowledge on these parasites is limited.

methods
in a community-based study, we examined  <dig> dogs in urban and rural areas of ilorin  for ectoparasites and intestinal helminths. in addition, a questionnaire regarding knowledge and practices was applied to pet owners.


RESULTS
nine ectoparasite species belonging to four taxa and six intestinal helminth species were identified: fleas , mites , ticks , and lice ; and toxocara canis, ancylostoma sp., trichuris vulpis, dipylidium caninum, taenidae and strongyloides sp. overall prevalence of ectoparasites was  <dig> % and of intestinal helminths  <dig> %. the occurrence of c. canis, r. sanguineus, t. canis, ancylostoma sp. and t. vulpis was most common . prevalence patterns in helminths were age-dependent, with t. canis showing a decreasing prevalence with age of host, and a reverse trend in other parasite species. knowledge regarding zoonoses was very limited and the diseases not considered a major health problem. treatment with antiparasitic drugs was more frequent in urban areas.


CONCLUSIONS
parasites of importance for human health were highly prevalent in nigerian dogs. interventions should include health education provided to dog owners and the establishment of a program focusing on zoonotic diseases.
