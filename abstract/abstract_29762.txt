BACKGROUND
constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks are widely used to simulate the properties of genome-scale metabolic networks. publicly available implementations tend to be slow, impeding large scale analyses such as the genome-wide computation of pairwise gene knock-outs, or the automated search for model improvements. furthermore, available implementations cannot easily be extended or adapted by users.


RESULTS
here, we present sybil, an open source software library for constraint-based analyses in r; r is a free, platform-independent environment for statistical computing and graphics that is widely used in bioinformatics. among other functions, sybil currently provides efficient methods for flux-balance analysis , moma, and room that are about ten times faster than previous implementations when calculating the effect of whole-genome single gene deletions in silico on a complete e. coli metabolic model.


CONCLUSIONS
due to the object-oriented architecture of sybil, users can easily build analysis pipelines in r or even implement their own constraint-based algorithms. based on its highly efficient communication with different mathematical optimisation programs, sybil facilitates the exploration of high-dimensional optimisation problems on small time scales. sybil and all its dependencies are open source. sybil and its documentation are available for download from the comprehensive r archive network .
