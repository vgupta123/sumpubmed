BACKGROUND
previously we reported extensive gene expression reprogramming during epithelial to mesenchymal transition  of primary prostate cells. here we investigated the hypothesis that specific histone and dna methylations are involved in coordination of gene expression during emt.


RESULTS
genome-wide profiling of histone methylations  and dna methylation  was applied to three cell lines at different stages of a stepwise prostate cell model involving emt and subsequent accumulation of malignant features. integrated analyses of epigenetic promoter modifications and gene expression changes revealed strong correlations between the dynamic changes of histone methylations and gene expression. dna methylation was weaker associated with global gene repression, but strongly correlated to gene silencing when genes co-modified by h3k4me <dig> were excluded. for genes labeled with multiple epigenetic marks in their promoters, the level of transcription was associated with the net signal intensity of the activating mark h3k4me <dig> minus the repressive marks h3k27me <dig> or dname, indicating that the effect on gene expression of bivalent marks  depends on relative modification intensities. sets of genes, including epithelial cell junction and emt associated fibroblast growth factor receptor genes, showed corresponding changes concerning epigenetic modifications and gene expression during emt.


CONCLUSIONS
this work presents the first blueprint of epigenetic modifications in an epithelial cell line and the progeny that underwent emt and shows that specific histone methylations are extensively involved in gene expression reprogramming during emt and subsequent accumulation of malignant features. the observation that transcription activity of bivalently marked genes depends on the relative labeling intensity of individual marks provides a new view of quantitative regulation of epigenetic modification.
