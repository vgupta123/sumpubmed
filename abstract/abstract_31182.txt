BACKGROUND
orthologous proteins of the crp/fnr family have been previously implicated in controlling expression and/or activity of the nifa transcriptional activator in some diazotrophs. this study aimed to address the role of three fnr-like proteins from h. seropedicae smr <dig> in controlling nifa activity and consequent nifa-mediated transcription activation.


RESULTS
the activity of nifa-dependent transcriptional fusions  was analysed in a series of h. seropedicae fnr deletion mutant backgrounds. we found that combined deletions in both the fnr <dig> and fnr <dig> genes lead to higher expression of both the nifa and nifb genes and also an increased level of nifh transcripts. expression profiles of nifb under different oxygen concentrations, together with oxygen consumption measurements suggest that the triple fnr mutant has higher respiratory activity when compared to the wild type, which we believe to be responsible for greater stability of the oxygen sensitive nifa protein. this conclusion was further substantiated by measuring the levels of nifa protein and its activity in fnr deletion strains in comparison with the wild-type.


CONCLUSIONS
fnr proteins are indirectly involved in controlling the activity of nifa in h. seropedicae, probably as a consequence of their influence on respiratory activity in relation to oxygen availability. additionally we can suggest that there is some redundancy in the physiological function of the three fnr paralogs in this organism, since altered respiration and effects on nifa activity are only observed in deletion strains lacking both fnr <dig> and fnr <dig>
