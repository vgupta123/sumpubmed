BACKGROUND
polyploidisation is one of the most important mechanisms in the evolution of angiosperms. as in many other genera, formation of polyploids has significantly contributed to diversification and radiation of knautia . comprehensive studies of fine- and broad-scale patterns of ploidy and genome size  variation are, however, still limited to relatively few genera and little is known about the geographic distribution of ploidy levels within these genera. here, we explore ploidy and gs variation in knautia based on a near-complete taxonomic and comprehensive geographic sampling.


RESULTS
genome size is a reliable indicator of ploidy level in knautia, even if monoploid genome downsizing is observed in the polyploid cytotypes. twenty-four species studied are diploid,  <dig> tetraploid and two hexaploid, whereas ten species possess two, and two species possess three ploidy levels. di- and tetraploids are distributed across most of the distribution area of knautia, while hexaploids were sampled in the balkan and iberian peninsulas and the alps.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that the frequency of polyploidisation is unevenly distributed in knautia both in a geographic and phylogenetic context. monoploid gs varies considerably among three evolutionary lineages  of knautia, but also within sections trichera and tricheroides, as well as within some of the species. although the exact causes of this variation remain elusive, we demonstrate that monoploid gs increases significantly towards the limits of the genus’ distribution.
