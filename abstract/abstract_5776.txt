BACKGROUND
bacterial drug resistance is one of the most significant challenges to human health today. in particular, effective antibacterial agents against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  are urgently needed. a causal relationship between nasal commensal s. aureus and infection has been reported. accordingly, elimination of nasal s. aureus reduces the risk of infection. enzymes that degrade bacterial cell walls show promise as antibacterial agents. bacteriophage-encoded bacterial cell wall-degrading enzymes exhibit intrinsic bactericidal activity. p <dig> is a chimeric protein that combines the lethal activity of the phage tail-associated muralytic enzyme of phage k and the staphylococcal cell wall targeting-domain  of lysostaphin.

here we report results of in vitro studies evaluating the susceptibility of staphylococcal strains to this novel protein.


RESULTS
using the broth microdilution method adapted for lysostaphin, we found that p <dig> is effective against s. aureus clinical strains including mrsa, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus , and a mupirocin-resistant s. aureus. minimum bactericidal concentrations and minimum inhibitory concentrations of p <dig>  were similar across the  <dig> s. aureus strains tested, demonstrating its bactericidal nature.

in time-kill assays, p <dig> reduced colony-forming units by  <dig> % within  <dig> h and inhibited growth up to  <dig> h.

in an assay simulating topical application of p <dig> to skin or other biological surfaces, p <dig> hydrogel was efficacious when layered on cells seeded on solid media. p <dig> hydrogel was lethal to staphylococci recovered from nares of healthy people and treated without any processing or culturing steps, indicating its in situ efficacy. this methodology used for in vitro assessment of p <dig> as an agent for eradicating nasal carriage is unique.


CONCLUSIONS
the novel chimeric protein p <dig> is a staphylococcal cell wall-degrading enzyme under development for clearance of s. aureus nasal colonization and mrsa infection. the protein is active against globally prevalent antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates and other clinically significant staphylococcal species including s. epidermidis. the p <dig> hydrogel formulation was bactericidal against staphylococci including s. aureus recovered from the nares of  <dig> healthy people, demonstrating its in situ efficacy.
