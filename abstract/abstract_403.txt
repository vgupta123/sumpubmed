BACKGROUND
gene expression is achieved by the coordinated action of multiple factors to ensure a perfect synchrony from chromatin epigenetic regulation through to mrna export. sus <dig> is a conserved mrna export/transcription factor and is a key player in coupling transcription initiation, elongation and mrna export. in the nucleus, sus <dig> is associated to the transcriptional co-activator saga and to the npc associated complex termed trex2/thsc. through these associations, sus <dig> mediates the nuclear dynamics of different gene loci and facilitate the export of the new transcripts.


RESULTS
in this study, we have investigated whether the yeast sus <dig> protein is linked to factors involved in mrna degradation pathways. we provide evidence for genetic interactions between sus <dig> and genes coding for components of p-bodies such as pat <dig>  lsm <dig>  lsm <dig> and dhh <dig>  we demonstrate that sus <dig> deletion is synthetic lethal with 5'â†’3' decay machinery components lsm <dig> and pat <dig> and has a strong genetic interaction with lsm <dig> and dhh <dig>  interestingly, sus <dig> overexpression led to an accumulation of sus <dig> in cytoplasmic granules, which can co-localise with components of p-bodies and stress granules. in addition, we have identified novel physical interactions between sus <dig> and factors associated to p-bodies/stress granules. finally, absence of lsm <dig> and pat <dig> slightly promotes the sus1-trex <dig> association.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we found genetic and biochemical association between sus <dig> and components responsible for cytoplasmic mrna metabolism. moreover, sus <dig> accumulates in discrete cytoplasmic granules, which partially co-localise with p-bodies and stress granules under specific conditions. these interactions suggest a role for sus <dig> in gene expression during cytoplasmic mrna metabolism in addition to its nuclear function.
