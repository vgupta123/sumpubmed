BACKGROUND
the guanine nucleotide binding protein -coupled receptors  regulate cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. g proteins are also implicated in erythroid differentiation, and some of them are expressed principally in hematopoietic cells. gpcrs-linked no/cgmp and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways already demonstrated potency for globin gene stimulation. by analyzing erythroid progenitors, derived from hematopoietic cells through in vitro ontogeny, our study intends to determine early markers and signaling pathways of globin gene regulation and their relation to gpcr expression.


RESULTS
human hematopoietic cd34+ progenitors are isolated from fetal liver , cord blood , adult bone marrow , peripheral blood  and g-csf stimulated mobilized pb , and then differentiated in vitro into erythroid progenitors. we find that growth capacity is most abundant in fl- and cb-derived erythroid cells. the erythroid progenitor cells are sorted as 100% cd71+, but we did not find statistical significance in the variations of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and glya antigens and that confirms similarity in maturation of studied ontogenic periods. during ontogeny, beta-globin gene expression reaches maximum levels in cells of adult blood origin , while gamma-globin gene expression is consistently up-regulated in cb-derived cells . during gamma-globin induction by hydroxycarbamide, we identify stimulated gpcrs  and gpcrs-coupled genes known to be activated via the camp/pka , mapk pathway  and no/cgmp  signaling pathways. during ontogeny, gpr <dig> and arrdc <dig> genes have the most prominent expression in fl-derived erythroid progenitor cells, gnl <dig> and grp <dig> genes in cb-derived cells , gpr <dig> and gng <dig> in bm-derived cells, gpr89c and gpr172a in pb-derived cells, and gpr <dig> and gnaq genes in mpb-derived cells .


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate the concomitant activity of gpcr-coupled genes and related signaling pathways during erythropoietic stimulation of globin genes. in accordance with previous reports, the stimulation of gpcrs supports the postulated connection between camp/pka and no/cgmp pathways in activation of Î³-globin expression, via jun and p <dig> mapk signaling.
