BACKGROUND
the tic complex  mediates the translocation of nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins across the inner envelope membrane. tic <dig> forms one prominent protein translocation channel. additionally, tic <dig>  another subunit of the complex, was proposed to form a protein import channel - either together with or independent of tic <dig>  however, no experimental evidence for tic <dig> channel activity has been provided so far.


RESULTS
we performed a comprehensive biochemical and electrophysiological study to characterize tic <dig> in more detail and to gain a deeper insight into its potential role in protein import into chloroplasts. firstly, we compared transcript and protein levels of tic <dig> and tic <dig> in both pisum sativum and arabidopsis thaliana. we found the tic <dig> protein to be generally less abundant, which was particularly pronounced in arabidopsis. secondly, we demonstrated that tic <dig> forms a complex larger than  <dig> kilodalton in the inner envelope membrane, which is clearly separate from tic <dig>  migrating as a dimer at about  <dig> kilodalton. thirdly, we defined the topology of tic <dig> in the inner envelope, and found its n- and c-termini to be oriented towards the stromal side. finally, we successfully reconstituted overexpressed and purified full-length tic <dig> into liposomes. using these tic20-proteoliposomes, we could demonstrate for the first time that tic <dig> can independently form a cation selective channel in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented data provide first biochemical evidence to the notion that tic <dig> can act as a channel protein within the chloroplast import translocon complex. however, the very low abundance of tic <dig> in the inner envelope membranes indicates that it cannot form a major protein translocation channel. furthermore, the independent complex formation of tic <dig> and tic <dig> argues against a joint channel formation. thus, based on the observed channel activity of tic <dig> in proteoliposomes, we speculate that the chloroplast inner envelope contains multiple  translocation channels: tic <dig> as the general translocation pore, whereas tic <dig> could be responsible for translocation of a special subset of proteins.
