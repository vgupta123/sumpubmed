BACKGROUND
in the c. albicans retrotransposon tca <dig>  the gag and pol orfs are separated by a uga stop codon, 3' of which is a potential rna pseudoknot. it is unclear how the tca <dig> gag uga codon is bypassed to allow pol expression. however, in other retroelements, translational readthrough of the gag stop codon can be directed by its flanking sequence, including a 3' pseudoknot.


RESULTS
the hypothesis was tested that in tca <dig>  gag stop codon flanking sequences direct translational readthrough and synthesis of a gag-pol fusion protein. sequence from the tca <dig> gag-uga-pol junction  was inserted between fused lacz and luciferase  genes in a saccharomyces cerevisiae dual reporter construct. although downstream of uga, luc was expressed, but its expression was unaffected by inserting additional stop codons at the 3' end of lacz. luc expression was instead being driven by a previously unknown minor promoter activity within the gag-pol junction region. evidence together indicated that junction sequence alone cannot direct uga readthrough. using reporter genes in c. albicans, the activities of this gag-pol junction promoter and the tca <dig> long terminal repeat  promoter were compared. of the two promoters, only the ltr promoter was induced by heat-shock, which also triggers retrotransposition. tca <dig> pol protein, epitope-tagged in c. albicans to allow detection, was also heat-shock induced, indicating that pol proteins were expressed from a gag-uga-pol rna.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first demonstration that the ltr promoter directs tca <dig> pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol rna, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. however, in contrast to most other retroelement and viral readthrough signals, immediate gag uga-flanking sequences were insufficient to direct stop readthrough in s. cerevisiae, indicating non-canonical mechanisms direct gag uga bypass in tca <dig>
