BACKGROUND
francisellosis, caused by the bacterium francisella noatunensis subsp. noatunensis, remains a serious threat to atlantic cod  farming in norway and potentially in other countries. as outbreak strains appear clonal in population structure, access to highly discriminatory typing tools is critical for understanding the epidemiology of francisellosis infections in aquaculture. in this study, a simplified multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeat analysis  targeting five highly polymorphic variable number of tandem repeat  loci in a single multiplex pcr was developed to rapidly discriminate between outbreak strains.


RESULTS
the assay resulted in identification of at least  <dig> different allelic profiles or subpopulations among 91â€‰f. noatunensis isolates from farmed cod in norway. the vntr loci appear relatively stable, with isolates originating from individual outbreaks showing identical mlva profiles following repeated passage. mlva displayed greater discriminatory power than pulse-field gel electrophoresis . both mlva and pfge show good epidemiological concordance by their abilities to separate outbreak strains from epidemiologically unrelated isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
the mlva method presented here is robust, easy to perform and provides a good alternative to other typing systems for f. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis and epidemiological study of francisellosis in cod.
