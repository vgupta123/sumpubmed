BACKGROUND
while the ultimate causes of most species extinctions are environmental, environmental constraints have various secondary consequences on evolutionary and ecological processes. the roles of demographic, genetic mechanisms and their interactions in limiting the viabilities of species or populations have stirred much debate and remain difficult to evaluate in the absence of demography-genetics conceptual and technical framework. here, i computed projected times to metapopulation extinction using  a model focusing on the effects of species properties, habitat quality, quantity and temporal variability on the time to demographic extinction;  a genetic model focusing on the dynamics of the drift and inbreeding loads under the same species and habitat constraints;  a demo-genetic model accounting for demographic-genetic processes and feedbacks.


RESULTS
results indicate that a given population may have a high demographic, but low genetic viability or vice versa; and whether genetic or demographic aspects will be the most limiting to overall viability depends on the constraints faced by the species . as a consequence, depending on metapopulation or species characteristics, incorporating genetic considerations to demographically-based viability assessments may either moderately or severely reduce the persistence time. on the other hand, purely genetically-based estimates of species viability may either underestimate  or overestimate  true viability.


CONCLUSIONS
unbiased assessments of the viabilities of species may only be obtained by identifying and considering the most limiting processes , or, preferentially, by integrating them.
