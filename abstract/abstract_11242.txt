BACKGROUND
this paper presents multilevel data glyphs optimized for the interactive knowledge
discovery and visualization of large biomedical data sets. data glyphs are three-
dimensional objects defined by multiple levels of geometric descriptions  combined with a mapping of data attributes to graphical elements and
methods, which specify their spatial position.

methods
in the data mapping phase, which is done by a biomedical expert, meta information
about the data attributes  are compared with the
visual capabilities of the graphical elements in order to give a feedback to the
user about the correctness of the variable mapping. the spatial arrangement of
glyphs is done in a dimetric view, which leads to high data density, a simplified
3d navigation and avoids perspective distortion.


RESULTS
we show the usage of data glyphs in the disease analyser a visual
analytics application for personalized medicine and provide an outlook to a
biomedical web visualization scenario.


CONCLUSIONS
data glyphs can be successfully applied in the disease analyser for the
analysis of big medical data sets. especially the automatic validation of the data
mapping, selection of subgroups within histograms and the visual comparison of the
value distributions were seen by experts as an important functionality.
