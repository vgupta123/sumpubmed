BACKGROUND
many studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction, complex i inhibition in particular, is involved in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease . rotenone, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial complex i, has been shown to produce neurodegeneration in rats as well as in many cellular models that closely resemble pd. however, the mechanisms through which complex i dysfunction might produce neurotoxicity are as yet unknown. a comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial protein expression profile affected by rotenone can provide important insight into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in pd.


RESULTS
here, we present our findings using a recently developed proteomic technology called silac  combined with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to compare the mitochondrial protein profiles of mes cells  exposed to rotenone versus control. we identified  <dig> proteins,  <dig> of which are already designated as mitochondrial proteins based on database search. among these  <dig> mitochondrial proteins,  <dig> displayed significant changes in relative abundance after rotenone treatment. five of these selected proteins were further validated for their cellular location and/or treatment effect of rotenone. among them, two were confirmed by confocal microscopy for mitochondrial localization and three were confirmed by western blotting  for their regulation by rotenone.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings represent the first report of these mitochondrial proteins affected by rotenone; further characterization of these proteins may shed more light on pd pathogenesis.
