BACKGROUND
expressed sequences  are a strong source of evidence to improve gene structures and predict reliable alternative splicing events. when a genome assembly is available, ests are suitable to generate gene-oriented clusters through the well-established easycluster software. nowadays, est-like sequences can be massively produced using next generation sequencing  technologies. in order to handle genome-scale transcriptome data, we present here easycluster <dig>  a reimplementation of easycluster able to speed up the creation of gene-oriented clusters and facilitate downstream analyses as the assembly of full-length transcripts and the detection of splicing isoforms.


RESULTS
easycluster <dig> has been developed to facilitate the genome-based clustering of est-like sequences generated through the ngs  <dig> technology. reads mapped onto the reference genome can be uploaded using the standard gff <dig> file format. alignment parsing is initially performed to produce a first collection of pseudo-clusters by grouping reads according to the overlap of their genomic coordinates on the same strand. easycluster <dig> then refines read grouping by including in each cluster only reads sharing at least one splice site and optionally performs a smith-waterman alignment in the region surrounding splice sites in order to correct for potential alignment errors. in addition, easycluster <dig> can include unspliced reads, which generally account for >50% of  <dig> datasets, and collapses overlapping clusters. finally, easycluster <dig> can assemble full-length transcripts using a directed-acyclic-graph-based strategy, simplifying the identification of alternative splicing isoforms, thanks also to the implementation of the widespread astalavista methodology. accuracy and performances have been tested on real as well as simulated datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
easycluster <dig> represents a unique tool to cluster and assemble transcriptome reads produced with  <dig> technology, as well as ests and full-length transcripts. the clustering procedure is enhanced with the employment of genome annotations and unspliced reads. overall, easycluster <dig> is able to perform an effective detection of splicing isoforms, since it can refine exon-exon junctions and explore alternative splicing without known reference transcripts. results in gff <dig> format can be browsed in the ucsc genome browser. therefore, easycluster <dig> is a powerful tool to generate reliable clusters for gene expression studies, facilitating the analysis also to researchers not skilled in bioinformatics.
