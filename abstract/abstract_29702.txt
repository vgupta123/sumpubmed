BACKGROUND
meiotic double-strand breaks occur at relatively high frequencies in some genomic regions  and relatively low frequencies in others . hotspots and coldspots are receiving increasing attention in research into the mechanism of meiotic recombination. however, predicting hotspots and coldspots from dna sequence information is still a challenging task.


RESULTS
we present a novel method for classification of hot and cold orfs located in hotspots and coldspots respectively in saccharomyces cerevisiae, using support vector machine , which relies on codon composition differences. this method has achieved a high classification accuracy of  <dig> %. since codon composition is a fusion of codon usage bias and amino acid composition signals, the ability of these two kinds of sequence attributes to discriminate hot orfs from cold orfs was also investigated separately. our results indicate that neither codon usage bias nor amino acid composition taken separately performed as well as codon composition. moreover, our svm based method was applied to the full genome: we predicted the hot/cold orfs from the yeast genome by using cutoffs of recombination rate. we found that the performance of our method for predicting cold orfs is not as good as that for predicting hot orfs. besides, we also observed a considerable correlation between meiotic recombination rate and amino acid composition of certain residues, which probably reflects the structural and functional dissimilarity between the hot and cold groups.


CONCLUSIONS
we have introduced a svm-based novel method to discriminate hot orfs from cold ones. applying codon composition as sequence attributes, we have achieved a high classification accuracy, which suggests that codon composition has strong potential to be used as sequence attributes in the prediction of hot and cold orfs.
