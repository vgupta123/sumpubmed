BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer , the non-genealogical transfer of genetic material between different organisms, is considered a potentially important mechanism of genome evolution in eukaryotes. using phylogenomic analyses of expressed sequence tag  data generated from a clonal cell line of a free living dinoflagellate alga karenia brevis, we investigated the impact of hgt on genome evolution in unicellular chromalveolate protists.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> proteins that have originated in chromalveolates through ancient hgts before the divergence of the genera karenia and karlodinium and one protein that was derived through a more recent hgt. detailed analysis of the phylogeny and distribution of identified proteins demonstrates that eight have resulted from independent hgts in several eukaryotic lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
recurring intra- and interdomain gene exchange provides an important source of genetic novelty not only in parasitic taxa as previously demonstrated but as we show here, also in free-living protists. investigating the tempo and mode of evolution of horizontally transferred genes in protists will therefore advance our understanding of mechanisms of adaptation in eukaryotes.
