BACKGROUND
breathing in humans is dually controlled for metabolic  and behavioral purposes  with reciprocal modulation through spinal integration. whereas the ventilatory response to chemical stimuli arises from the brainstem, the compensation of mechanical loads in awake humans is thought to involve suprapontine mechanisms. the aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by examining the effects of inspiratory resistive loading on the response of the diaphragm to transcranial magnetic stimulation.


RESULTS
six healthy volunteers breathed room air without load  and then against inspiratory resistances . ventilatory variables were recorded. transcranial magnetic stimulation  was performed during early inspiration  or late expiration , giving rise to motor evoked potentials  in the diaphragm  and abductor pollicis brevis . breathing frequency significantly decreased during r <dig> without any other change. resistive breathing had no effect on the amplitude of di meps, but shortened their latency  when tms was superimposed on inspiration. there was no change in apb meps.


CONCLUSIONS
inspiratory resistive breathing facilitates the diaphragm response to tms while it does not increase the automatic drive to breathe. we interpret these findings as a neurophysiological substratum of the suprapontine nature of inspiratory load compensation in awake humans.
