BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor-β  regulates key biological processes during development and in adult tissues and has been implicated in many diseases. to study the biological functions of tgf-β, sensitive, specific, and convenient bioassays are necessary. here we describe a new cell-based bioassay that fulfills these requirements.


RESULTS
embryonic fibroblasts from tgfb1-/- mice were stably transfected with a reporter plasmid consisting of tgf-β responsive smad-binding elements coupled to a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene . clone mfb-f <dig> showed more than 1000-fold induction after stimulation with  <dig> ng/ml tgf-β <dig>  and detected as little as  <dig> pg/ml tgf-β <dig>  mfb-f <dig> cells were highly induced by tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig> and tgf-β <dig>  but did not show induction with related family members activin, nodal, bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> or with trophic factors bfgf and bdnf. mfb-f <dig> cells can detect and quantify tgf-β in biological samples without prior enrichment of tgf-βs, and can detect biologically activated tgf-β in a cell co-culture system.


CONCLUSIONS
mfb-f <dig> cells can be used to rapidly and specifically measure tgf-β with high sensitivity.
