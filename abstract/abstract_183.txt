BACKGROUND
metal tolerance in bacteria has been related to polyp in a model in which heavy metals stimulate the polymer hydrolysis, forming metal-phosphate complexes that are exported. as previously described in our laboratory, escherichia coli cells grown in media containing a phosphate concentration >37 mm maintained an unusually high polyphosphate  level in stationary phase. the aim of the present work was to evaluate the influence of polyp levels as the involvement of low-affinity inorganic phosphate transport  system in e. coli copper tolerance.


RESULTS
polyp levels were modulated by the media phosphate concentration and/or using mutants in polyp metabolism. stationary phase wild-type cells grown in high phosphate medium were significantly more tolerant to copper than those grown in sufficient phosphate medium. copper addition to tolerant cells induced polyp degradation by ppx , phosphate efflux and membrane polarization. ppk−ppx− , ppx−  and pit system mutants were highly sensitive to metal even in high phosphate media. in exponential phase, copa and polyp-pit system would act simultaneously to detoxify the metal or one could be sufficient to safeguard the absence of the other.


CONCLUSIONS
our results support a mechanism for copper detoxification in exponential and stationary phases of e. coli, involving pit system and degradation of polyp. data reflect the importance of the environmental phosphate concentration in the regulation of the microbial physiological state.
