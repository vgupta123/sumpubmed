BACKGROUND
anticancer bisdioxopiperazines, including icrf- <dig>  razoxane  and icrf- <dig>  are a family of anticancer agents developed in the uk, especially targeting metastases of neoplasms. two other bisdioxopiperazine derivatives, probimane  and mst- <dig>  were synthesized at the shanghai institute of materia medica, chinese academy of sciences, shanghai, china. cytotoxic activities and mechanisms of raz -steroisomer , pro and mst- <dig> against tumor cells were evaluated by mtt colorimetry, flow cytometry and karyotyping.


RESULTS
pro was cytotoxic to human tumor cell lines in vitro . four human tumor cell lines  were susceptible to pro at low inhibitory concentrations . although the ic <dig> against hela cell line of vincristine , doxorubicin  and 5-fluoruouracil  are lower than pro , icrf- <dig>  and mst- <dig> , vcr, dox and 5-fu shows a low dose-related – high cytotoxic activity. time-response studies showed that the cytotoxic effects of pro are increased for  <dig> days in human tumor cells, whereas vcr, dox and 5-fu showed decreased cytotoxic action after  <dig> h. cell cycle g2/m phase arrest and chromosome segregation blocking by pro and mst- <dig> were noted. although there was similar effects of pro and mst- <dig> on chromosome segregation blocking action and cell cycle g2/m phase arrest at 1-  <dig> μm, cytotoxicity of pro against tumor cells was higher than that of mst- <dig> in vitro by a factor of 3-  <dig> folds. our data show that pro may be more effective against lung cancer and leukemia while icrf- <dig> and mst- <dig> shows similar ic <dig> values only against leukemia.


CONCLUSIONS
it suggests that pro has a wider spectrum of cytotoxic effects against human tumor cells than other bisdioxopiperazines, especially against solid tumors, and with a single cytotoxic pathway of pro and mst- <dig> affecting chromosome segregation and leading also to cell g2/ m phase arrests, which finally reduces cell division rates. pro may be more potent than mst- <dig> in cytotoxicity. high dose- and time- responses of pro, when compared with vcr, 5-fu and dox, were seen that suggest a selectivity of pro against tumor growth. compounds of bisdioxopiperazines family may keep up their cytotoxic effects longer than many other anticancer drugs.
