BACKGROUND
multidrug resistance  is a clinically, highly relevant phenomenon. under chemotherapy many tumors show an increasing resistance towards the applied substance and to a certain extent also towards other agents. an important molecular cause of this phenomenon is an increased expression of transporter proteins. the functional relationship between high expression levels and chemotherapy resistance makes these mdr and mrp  proteins to interesting therapeutic targets. we here wanted to systematically analyze, whether these proteins are tumor specific antigens which could be targeted immunologically.


RESULTS
using the reverse immunology approach,  <dig> hla-a <dig>  restricted mdr and mrp derived peptides  were selected. stimulated t cell lines grew well and mainly contained activated cd8+ cells. peptide specificity and hla-a <dig>  restriction were proven in ifn-Î³-elispot analyses and in cytotoxicity tests against mdp loaded target cells for a total of twelve peptides derived from mdr- <dig>  mdr- <dig>  mrp- <dig>  mrp- <dig>  mrp- <dig> and mrp- <dig>  of note, two of these epitopes are shared between mdr- <dig> and mdr- <dig> as well as mrp- <dig> and mrp- <dig>  however, comparably weak cytotoxic activities were additionally observed against hla-a <dig> + tumor cells even after upregulation of mdr protein expression by in vitro chemotherapy.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data demonstrate that human t cells can be sensitised towards mdps and hence, there is no absolute immunological tolerance. however, our data also hint towards rather low endogenous tumor cell processing and presentation of mdps in the context of hla-a <dig>  molecules. consequently, we conclude that mdr and mrp proteins must be considered as weak tumor specific antigens-at least for colorectal carcinoma. their direct contribution to therapy-failure implies however, that it is worth to further pursue this approach.
