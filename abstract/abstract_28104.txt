BACKGROUND
the canonical mitogen activated protein kinase  signaling pathway plays a vital role in carrying out the normal growth and development of the plant. the pathway, connecting the upstreams signal with the downstream target is considered to be linear, mostly starting with a mapkkk and ending in a mapk.


RESULTS
here we report a novel interaction between two rice mapks, osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> suggesting the complex nature of the pathway rather than a linear one at individual steps. the interaction between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> found by yeast two-hybrid analysis was confirmed in planta by co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer  assays. the interaction is specific and is phosphorylation independent. the results suggest a role of the interaction between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> in basic plant defense.


CONCLUSIONS
the current novel work showing the physical interaction between two plant mapks, osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> is the diversion from the dogma of a typical mapk cascade thereby opening a new dimension to the mapk signal transduction.
