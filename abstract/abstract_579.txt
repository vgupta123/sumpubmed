BACKGROUND
the australian sheep blowfly lucilia cuprina   is a destructive pest of the sheep, a model organism for insecticide resistance research, and a valuable tool for medical and forensic professionals. however, genomic information on l. cuprina is still sparse.


RESULTS
we report here the construction of an embryonic and  <dig> larval cdna libraries for l. cuprina. a total of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  were obtained and assembled into  <dig>  unique clusters. the sequence collection captures a great diversity of genes, including those related to insecticide resistance . compared to drosophila melanogaster, codon preference is different in  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acids encoded by redundant codons, reflecting the lower overall gc content in l. cuprina. in addition, we demonstrated that the ests could be converted into informative gene markers by capitalizing on the known gene structures in the model organism d. melanogaster. we successfully assigned  <dig> genes to their respective chromosomes in l. cuprina. the relative locations of these loci revealed high but incomplete chromosomal synteny between l. cuprina and d. melanogaster.


CONCLUSIONS
our results represent the first major transcriptomic undertaking in l. cuprina. these new genetic resources could be useful for the blowfly and insect research community.
