BACKGROUND
genotyping-by-sequencing  is a high-throughput genotyping approach that is starting to be used in several crop species, including bread wheat. anchoring gbs tags on chromosomes is an important step towards utilizing them for wheat genetic improvement. here we use genetic linkage mapping to construct a consensus map containing  <dig> gbs markers.


RESULTS
three ril populations, pbw343 × kingbird, pbw343 × kenya swara and pbw343 × muu, which share a common parent, were used to minimize the impact of potential structural genomic variation on consensus-map quality. the consensus map comprised  <dig> unique positions, and the average marker distance was  <dig>  cm, obtained by calculating the average distance between two adjacent unique positions. significant variation of segregation distortion was observed across the three populations. the consensus map was validated by comparing positions of known rust resistance genes, and comparing them to wheat reference genome sequences recently published by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium, rye and ae. tauschii genomes. three well-characterized rust resistance genes  and  <dig> published qtls for wheat rusts were validated with high resolution. fifty-two per cent of gbs tags on the consensus map were successfully aligned through blast to the right chromosomes on the wheat reference genome sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
the consensus map should provide a useful basis for analyzing genome-wide variation of complex traits. the identified genes can then be explored as genetic markers to be used in genomic applications in wheat breeding.
