BACKGROUND
detecting new coding sequences  in viral genomes can be difficult for several reasons. the typically compact genomes often contain a number of overlapping coding and non-coding functional elements, which can result in unusual patterns of codon usage; conservation between related sequences can be difficult to interpret – especially within overlapping genes; and viruses often employ non-canonical translational mechanisms – e.g. frameshifting, stop codon read-through, leaky-scanning and internal ribosome entry sites – which can conceal potentially coding open reading frames .


RESULTS
in a previous paper we introduced a new statistic – mlogd  – for detecting and analysing overlapping cdss. here we present  an improved mlogd statistic,  a greatly extended suite of software using mlogd,  a database of results for  <dig> virus sequence alignments, and  a web-interface to the software and database. tests show that, from an alignment with just  <dig> mutations, mlogd can discriminate non-overlapping cdss from non-coding orfs with a typical accuracy of up to 98%, and can detect cdss overlapping known cdss with a typical accuracy of 90%. in addition, the software produces a variety of statistics and graphics, useful for analysing an input multiple sequence alignment.


CONCLUSIONS
mlogd is an easy-to-use tool for virus genome annotation, detecting new cdss – in particular overlapping or short cdss – and for analysing overlapping cdss following frameshift sites. the software, web-server, database and supplementary material are available at .
