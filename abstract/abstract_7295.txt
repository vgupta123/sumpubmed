BACKGROUND
the re-replication inhibitor geminin binds to several transcription factors including homeodomain proteins, and to members of the polycomb and the swi/snf complexes.


RESULTS
here we describe the tata-binding protein-like factor-interacting protein  isoform  <dig>  as a strong binding partner of geminin. tipt <dig> is widely expressed in mouse embryonic and adult tissues, residing both in cyto- and nucleoplasma, and enriched in the nucleolus. like geminin, also tipt <dig> interacts with several polycomb factors, with the general transcription factor tbp , and with the related protein tbpl <dig> . tipt <dig> synergizes with geminin and tbp in the activation of tata box-containing promoters, and with tbpl <dig> and geminin in the activation of the tata-less nf <dig> promoter. geminin and tipt <dig> were detected in the chromatin near tbp/tbpl <dig> binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our study introduces a novel transcriptional regulator and its function in cooperation with chromatin associated factors and the basal transcription machinery.
