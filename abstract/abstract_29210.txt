BACKGROUND
the taxis signaling system of the extreme halophilic archaeon halobacterium  salinarum differs in several aspects from its model bacterial counterparts escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. we studied the protein interactions in the hbt. salinarum taxis signaling system to gain an understanding of its structure, to gain knowledge about its known components and to search for new members.


RESULTS
the interaction analysis revealed that the core signaling proteins are involved in different protein complexes and our data provide evidence for dynamic interchanges between them. fifteen of the eighteen taxis receptors  can be assigned to four different groups depending on their interactions with the core signaling proteins. only one of these groups, which contains six of the eight htrs with known signals, shows the composition expected for signaling complexes . from the two hbt. salinarum chew proteins, only chew <dig> is engaged in signaling complexes with htrs and chea, whereas chew <dig> interacts with htrs but not with chea. chey connects the core signaling structure to a subnetwork consisting of the two chef proteins , ched , two chec complexes and the receptor methylesterase cheb.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our findings, we propose two hypotheses. first, hbt. salinarum might have the capability to dynamically adjust the impact of certain htrs or htr clusters depending on its current needs or environmental conditions. secondly, we propose a hypothetical feedback loop from the response regulator to htr methylation made from the chec proteins, ched and cheb, which might contribute to adaptation analogous to the chec/ched system of b. subtilis.
