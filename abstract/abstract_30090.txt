BACKGROUND
intron-derived long noncoding rnas with snorna ends  are highly expressed from the imprinted prader-willi syndrome  region on human chromosome  <dig>  however, sno-lncrnas from other regions of the human genome or from other genomes have not yet been documented.


RESULTS
by exploring non-polyadenylated transcriptomes from human, rhesus and mouse, we have systematically annotated sno-lncrnas expressed in all three species. in total, using available data from a limited set of cell lines,  <dig> sno-lncrnas have been identified with tissue- and species-specific expression patterns. although primary sequence analysis revealed that snornas themselves are conserved from human to mouse, sno-lncrnas are not. pws region sno-lncrnas are highly expressed in human and rhesus monkey, but are undetectable in mouse. importantly, the absence of pws region sno-lncrnas in mouse suggested a possible reason why current mouse models fail to fully recapitulate pathological features of human pws. in addition, a rpl13a region sno-lncrna was specifically revealed in mouse embryonic stem cells, and its snorna ends were reported to influence lipid metabolism. interestingly, the rpl13a region sno-lncrna is barely detectable in human. we further demonstrated that the formation of sno-lncrnas is often associated with alternative splicing of exons within their parent genes, and species-specific alternative splicing leads to unique expression pattern of sno-lncrnas in different animals.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative transcriptomes of non-polyadenylated rnas among human, rhesus and mouse revealed that the expression of sno-lncrnas is species-specific and that their processing is closely linked to alternative splicing of their parent genes. this study thus further demonstrates a complex regulatory network of coding and noncoding parts of the mammalian genome.
