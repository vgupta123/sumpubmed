BACKGROUND
the development of chronic periodontitis was due to not only periodontal pathogens, but also the interaction between periodontal pathogens and host. the aim of this study is to investigate the alterations in gene expression in porphyromonas gingivalis  w <dig> after inoculation in rat oral cavity.


RESULTS
p.gingivalis w <dig> inoculation in rat oral cavity caused inflammatory responses in gingival tissues and destroyed host alveolar bone. microarray analysis revealed that  <dig> genes were upregulated, and  <dig> genes were downregulated in the detected  <dig> genes in the inoculated p.gingivalis w <dig>  real-time quantitative pcr detection confirmed the expression alterations in some selected genes. products of these upregulated and downregulated genes are mainly related to transposon functions, cell transmembrane transportation, protein and nucleic acid metabolism, energy metabolism, cell division and bacterial pathogenicity.


CONCLUSIONS
p.gingivalis w <dig> has a pathogenic effect on host oral cavity. meanwhile, inflammatory oral environment alters p.gingivalis w <dig> gene expression profile. these changes in gene expression may limit the proliferation and weaken the pathogenicity of p.gingivalis w <dig>  and favor themselves to adapt local environment for survival.
