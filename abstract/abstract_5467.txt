BACKGROUND
in plants, calcium-dependent protein kinases  are involved in tolerance to abiotic stresses and in plant seed development. however, the functions of only a few rice cdpks have been clarified. at present, it is unclear whether cdpks also play a role in regulating spikelet fertility.


RESULTS
we cloned and characterized the rice cdpk gene, oscpk <dig>  oscpk <dig> transcription was induced by abscisic acid , peg <dig>  and nacl treatments. the results of oscpk <dig> overexpression  and oscpk <dig> rna interference  analyses revealed that oscpk <dig> plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance and spikelet fertility. physiological analyses revealed that oscpk <dig> improves drought stress tolerance by enhancing stomatal closure and by improving the osmotic adjustment ability of the plant. it also improves pollen viability, thereby increasing spikelet fertility. in oscpk9-ox plants, shoot and root elongation showed enhanced sensitivity to aba, compared with that of wild-type. overexpression and rna interference of oscpk <dig> affected the transcript levels of aba- and stress-responsive genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated that oscpk <dig> is a positive regulator of abiotic stress tolerance, spikelet fertility, and aba sensitivity.
