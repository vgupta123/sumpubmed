BACKGROUND
transcript profiling of closely related species provides a means for identifying genes potentially important in species diversification. however, the predictive value of transcript profiling for inferring downstream-physiological processes has been unclear. in the present study we use shotgun proteomics to validate inferences from microarray studies regarding physiological differences in three pachycladon species. we compare transcript and protein profiling and evaluate their predictive value for inferring glucosinolate chemotypes characteristic of these species.


RESULTS
evidence from heterologous microarrays and shotgun proteomics revealed differential expression of genes involved in glucosinolate hydrolysis  and biosynthesis , the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate , water use efficiency  and others . differences in glucosinolate hydrolysis products were directly confirmed. overall, prediction of protein abundances from transcript profiles was stronger than prediction of transcript abundance from protein profiles. protein profiles also proved to be more accurate predictors of glucosinolate profiles than transcript profiles. the similarity of species profiles for both transcripts and proteins reflected previously inferred phylogenetic relationships while glucosinolate chemotypes did not.


CONCLUSIONS
we have used transcript and protein profiling to predict physiological processes that evolved differently during diversification of three pachycladon species. this approach has also identified candidate genes potentially important in adaptation, which are now the focus of ongoing study. our results indicate that protein profiling provides a valuable tool for validating transcript profiles in studies of adaptive divergence.
