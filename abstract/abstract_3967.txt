BACKGROUND
the cerebrospinal fluid  levels of total tau  and aβ1– <dig> are potential early diagnostic markers for probable alzheimer’s disease . the influence of genetic variation on these csf biomarkers has been investigated in candidate or genome-wide association studies . however, the investigation of statistically modest associations in gwas in the context of biological networks is still an under-explored topic in ad studies. the main objective of this study is to gain further biological insights via the integration of statistical gene associations in ad with physical protein interaction networks.


RESULTS
the csf and genotyping data of  <dig> study subjects  from the alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative  were analyzed. plink was used to perform gwas on the t-tau/aβ1– <dig> ratio using quality controlled genotype data, including  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms , with age, sex and diagnosis as covariates. gene-level p-values were obtained by vegas <dig>  genes with p-value ≤  <dig>  were mapped on to a protein-protein interaction  network . we integrated a consensus model strategy into the ipinbpa network analysis framework, and named it as cm-ipinbpa. four consensus modules  were discovered by cm-ipinbpa, and were functionally annotated using the pathway analysis tool enrichr. the intersection of four cms forms a common subnetwork of  <dig> genes, including those related to tau phosphorylation , amyloid beta production , and ad .


CONCLUSIONS
this study coupled a consensus module  strategy with the ipinbpa network analysis framework, and applied it to the gwas of csf t-tau/aβ1- <dig> ratio in an ad study. the genome-wide network analysis yielded  <dig> enriched cms that share not only genes related to tau phosphorylation or amyloid beta production but also multiple genes enriching several kegg pathways such as alzheimer’s disease, colorectal cancer, gliomas, renal cell carcinoma, huntington’s disease, and others. this study demonstrated that integration of gene-level associations with cms could yield statistically significant findings to offer valuable biological insights  and suggest high confidence candidates for subsequent analyses.
