BACKGROUND
betulinic acid  is a lupane-type triterpene which has been considered as a promising agent to cure melanoma with no side effects. considering that ba is naturally produced in small quantities in plants, we previously reported the success in engineering its production in yeast. in the present study, we attempted to improve ba biosynthesis in yeast by the use of different strategies.


RESULTS
we first isolated a gene encoding a lupeol c- <dig> oxidase  from betula platyphylla . bplo showed a higher activity in ba biosynthesis compared to the previously reported los. in addition, two yeast platforms were compared for engineering the production of ba, which demonstrated that the wat <dig> strain was better to host ba pathway than the cen.pk strain. based on the wat11-chassiss, the gal80p mutant was further constructed. the mutant produced  <dig>  mg/l/od <dig> of ba, which was  <dig>  fold of that produced by the wild type strain .


CONCLUSIONS
this study reported our efforts to improve ba production in yeast employing multiple strategies, which included the identification of a novel lo enzyme with a higher activity in ba biosynthesis, the evaluation of two yeast strains for hosting the ba pathway, and the up-regulation of the expression of the ba pathway genes by managing yeast gal gene regulon circuit.
