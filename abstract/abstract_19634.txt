BACKGROUND
cochlear hair cells are high-frequency sensory receptors. at the onset of hearing, hair cells acquire fast, calcium-activated potassium  currents, turning immature spiking cells into functional receptors. in non-mammalian vertebrates, the number and kinetics of bk channels are varied systematically along the frequency-axis of the cochlea giving rise to an intrinsic electrical tuning mechanism. the processes that control the appearance and heterogeneity of hair cell bk currents remain unclear.


RESULTS
quantitative pcr results showed a non-monotonic increase in bk α subunit expression throughout embryonic development of the chick auditory organ . expression peaked near embryonic day   <dig> with six times the transcript level of e <dig> sensory epithelia. the steady increase in gene expression from e <dig> to e <dig> could not explain the sudden acquisition of currents at e18- <dig>  implicating post-transcriptional mechanisms. protein expression also preceded function but progressed in a sequence from diffuse cytoplasmic staining at early ages to punctate membrane-bound clusters at e <dig>  electrophysiology data confirmed a continued refinement of bk trafficking from e <dig> to e <dig>  indicating a translocation of bk clusters from supranuclear to subnuclear domains over this critical developmental age.


CONCLUSIONS
gene products encoding bk α subunits are detected up to  <dig> days before the acquisition of anti-bk clusters and functional bk currents. therefore, post-transcriptional mechanisms seem to play a key role in the delayed emergence of calcium-sensitive currents. we suggest that regulation of translation and trafficking of functional α subunits, near voltage-gated calcium channels, leads to functional bk currents at the onset of hearing.
