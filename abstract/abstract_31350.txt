BACKGROUND
cell-permeant cre dna site-specific recombinases provide an easily controlled means to regulate gene structure and function in living cells. since recombination provides a stable and unambiguous record of protein uptake, the enzyme may also be used for quantitative studies of cis- and trans-acting factors that influence the delivery of proteins into cells.


RESULTS
in the present study,  <dig> recombinant fusion proteins were analyzed to characterize sequences and conditions that affect protein uptake and/or activity and to develop more active cell-permeant enzymes. we report that the native enzyme has a low, but intrinsic ability to enter cells. the most active cre proteins tested contained either an n-terminal 6xhis tag and a nuclear localization sequence from sv <dig> large t antigen  or the hiv tat transduction sequence and a c-terminal 6xhis tag . the nls and 6xhis elements separately enhanced the delivery of the hnc protein into cells; moreover, transduction sequences from fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  hiv tat or consisting of the 3k sequence were not required for efficient protein transduction and adversely affected enzyme solubility. transduction of the hnc protein required  <dig> to  <dig> min for half-maximum uptake, was greatly decreased at 4Â°c and was inhibited by serum. efficient recombination was observed in all cell types tested , and did not require localization of the enzyme to the nucleus.


CONCLUSIONS
the effects of different sequences on the delivery and/or activity of cre in cultured cells could not be predicted in advance. consequently, the process of developing more active cell-permeant recombinases was largely empirical. the hnc protein, with an excellent combination of activity, solubility and yield, will enhance the use of cell-permeant cre proteins to regulate gene structure and function in living cells.
