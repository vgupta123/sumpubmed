BACKGROUND
we had previously shown that the blzip domain-containing transcription factor, zhangfei/crebzf inhibits the growth and the unfolded protein response  in cells of the d– <dig> canine osteosarcoma  line and that the effects of zhangfei are mediated by it stabilizing the tumour suppressor protein p <dig>  to determine if our observations with d- <dig> cells applied more universally to canine os, we examined three other independently isolated canine os cell lines—abrams, mckinley and gracie.


RESULTS
like d– <dig>  the three cell lines expressed p <dig> proteins that were capable of activating promoters with p <dig> response elements on their own, and synergistically with zhangfei. furthermore, as with d– <dig> cells, zhangfei suppressed the growth and upr-related transcripts in the os cell lines. zhangfei also induced the activation of osteocalcin expression, a marker of osteoblast differentiation and triggered programmed cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
osteosarcomas are common malignancies in large breeds of dogs. although there has been dramatic progress in their treatment, these therapies often fail, leading to recurrence of the tumour and metastatic spread. our results indicate that induction of the expression of zhangfei in os, where p <dig> is functional, may be an effective modality for the treatment of os.
