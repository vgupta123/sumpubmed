BACKGROUND
semantic role labeling  is an important text analysis technique. in srl, sentences are represented by one or more predicate-argument structures . each pas is composed of a predicate  and several arguments  with different semantic roles, including main arguments  as well as adjunct arguments . propbank is the most widely used pas corpus and annotation format in the newswire domain. in the biomedical field, however, more detailed and restrictive pas annotation formats such as pasbio are popular. unfortunately, due to the lack of an annotated pasbio corpus, no publicly available machine-learning  based srl systems based on pasbio have been developed. in previous work, we constructed a biomedical corpus based on the propbank standard called bioprop, on which we developed an ml-based srl system, biosmile. in this paper, we aim to build a system to convert biosmile's bioprop annotation output to pasbio annotation. our system consists of biosmile in combination with a bioprop-pasbio rule-based converter, and an additional semi-automatic rule generator.


RESULTS
our first experiment evaluated our rule-based converter's performance independently from biosmile performance. the converter achieved an f-score of  <dig> %. the second experiment evaluated combined system . the system achieved an f-score of  <dig> % for pasbio's  <dig> verbs.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach allows pas conversion between bioprop and pasbio annotation using biosmile alongside our newly developed semi-automatic rule generator and rule-based converter. our system can match the performance of other state-of-the-art domain-specific ml-based srl systems and can be easily customized for pasbio application development.
