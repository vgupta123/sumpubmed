BACKGROUND
oxygen availability in aquatic habitats is a major environmental factor influencing the ecology, behaviour, and physiology of fishes. this study evaluates the contribution of source population and hypoxic acclimatization of the african fish, barbus neumayeri, in determining growth and tissue metabolic enzyme activities. individuals were collected from two sites differing dramatically in concentration of dissolved oxygen , rwembaita swamp  and inlet stream west  in kibale national park, uganda, and reciprocally transplanted using a cage experiment in the field, allowing us to maintain individuals under natural conditions of oxygen, food availability, and flow. fish were maintained under these conditions for four weeks and sampled for growth rate and the activities of phosphofructokinase , lactate dehydrogenase , citrate synthase , and cytochrome c oxidase  in four tissues, liver, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle.


RESULTS
acclimatization to the low do site resulted in lower growth rates, lower activities of the aerobic enzyme cco in heart, and higher activities of the glycolytic enzyme pfk in heart and skeletal muscle. the activity of ldh in liver tissue was correlated with site of origin, being higher in fish collected from a hypoxic habitat, regardless of acclimatization treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the influence of site of origin and hypoxic acclimatization in determining enzyme activity differs among enzymes and tissues, but both factors contribute to higher glycolytic capacity and lower aerobic capacity in b. neumayeri under naturally-occurring conditions of oxygen limitation.
