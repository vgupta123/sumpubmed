BACKGROUND
homer is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that links various synaptic signaling proteins, including the type i metabotropic glutamate receptor subunits 1α and  <dig>  the inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor, shank and cdc <dig> small gtpase. overexpression of homer induces changes in dendritic spine morphology in cultured hippocampal neurons. however, the molecular basis underpinning homer-mediated spine morphogenesis remains unclear. in this study, we aimed to elucidate the structural and functional properties of the interaction between cupidin/homer <dig> and two actin-cytoskeletal regulators, cdc <dig> small gtpase and drebrin.


RESULTS
cupidin/homer <dig> interacted with activated cdc <dig> small gtpase via the cdc42-binding domain that resides around amino acid residues 191– <dig>  within the c-terminal coiled-coil domain. we generated a cupidin deletion mutant lacking amino acids 191– <dig> , which showed decrease cdc42-binding ability but maintained self-multimerization ability. cupidin suppressed cdc42-induced filopodia-like protrusion formation in hela cells, whereas cpdΔ191– <dig> failed to do so. in cultured hippocampal neurons, cupidin was targeted to dendritic spines, whereas cpdΔ191– <dig> was distributed in dendritic shafts as well as spines. overexpression of cpdΔ191– <dig> decreased the number of synapses and reduced the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal neurons. cupidin interacted with a dendritic spine f-actin-binding protein, drebrin, which possesses two homer ligand motifs, via the n-terminal evh- <dig> domain. cpdΔ191– <dig> overexpression decreased drebrin clustering in the dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that cupidin/homer <dig> interacts with the dendritic spine actin regulators cdc <dig> and drebrin via its c-terminal and n-terminal domains, respectively, and that it may be involved in spine morphology and synaptic properties.
