BACKGROUND
in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in ssbs because they find numerous applications in diverse molecular biology and analytical methods.


RESULTS
we report the characterization of single-stranded dna binding proteins  from the thermophilic bacteria thermotoga maritima  and thermotoga neapolitana . they are the smallest known bacterial ssb proteins, consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the similarity between amino acid sequences of these proteins is very high: 90% identity and 95% similarity. surprisingly, both tmassb and tnessb possess a quite low sequence similarity to escherichia coli ssb . they are functional as homotetramers containing one single-stranded dna binding domain  in each monomer. agarose mobility assays indicated that the ssdna-binding site for both proteins is salt independent, and fluorescence spectroscopy resulted in a size of  <dig> ±  <dig> nucleotides. the half-lives of tmassb and tnessb were  <dig> h and  <dig> h at 100°c, respectively. when analysed by differential scanning microcalorimetry  the melting temperature  was  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c for tmassb and tnessb, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results showed that tmassb and tnessb are the most thermostable ssb proteins identified to date, offering an attractive alternative to taqssb and tthssb in molecular biology applications, especially with using high temperature e. g. polymerase chain reaction .
