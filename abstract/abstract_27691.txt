BACKGROUND
s. aureus is one of the main pathogens responsible for the intra-mammary infection in dairy ruminants. although much work has been carried out to understand the complex physiological and cellular events that occur in the mammary gland in response to s. aureus, the protective mechanisms are still poorly understood. the objectives of the present study were to investigate gene expression during the early response of the goat mammary gland to an experimental challenge with s. aureus, in order to better understand the local and systemic response and to compare them in two divergent lines of goat selected for high and low milk somatic cell scores.


RESULTS
no differences in gene expression were found between high and low scs  selection lines. analysing the two groups together, an expression of  <dig> genes were found to change from t <dig> before infection, and t <dig> at  <dig> hours and t <dig> at  <dig> hours following challenge. in blood derived white blood cells  <dig> genes showed increased expression between t <dig> and t <dig> and  <dig> gene has reduced expression. the genes showing the greatest increase in expression following challenge  play an important role in  immune and inflammatory response ;  the regulation of innate resistance to pathogens ; and  the regulation of cell metabolism . the genes with reduced expression  included genes involved in  lipid metabolism ,  chemokine, cytokine and intracellular signalling , and  cell cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix .


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of genes with differential expression following infection showed an inverse relationship between immune response and lipid metabolism in the early response of the mammary gland to the s. aureus challenge. ptx <dig> showed a large change in expression in both milk and blood, and is therefore a candidate for further studies on immune response associated with mastitis.
