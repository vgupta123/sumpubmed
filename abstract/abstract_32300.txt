BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor -β is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine necessary for cancer growth. animal and human studies have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of tgf-β slows the growth rate of established tumors and occasionally eradicates them altogether. we observed, paradoxically, that inhibiting tgf-β before exposing animals to tumor cells increases tumor growth kinetics. we hypothesized that tgf-β is necessary for the anti-tumor effects of cytotoxic cd8+ t lymphocytes  during the early stages of tumor initiation.

methods
balb/c mice were pretreated with a blocking soluble tgf-β receptor  or igg2a  before tumor inoculation. tumor size was followed for  <dig> weeks. in vivo lymphocyte assays and depletion experiments were then performed to investigate the immunological basis of our results. lastly, animals were pretreated with either stgf-βr  or igg2a  prior to immunization with an adenoviral vector encoding the human papillomavirus e <dig> gene . one week later, flow cytometry was utilized to measure the number of splenic e7-specific cd8+ t cells.


RESULTS
inhibition of tgf-β before the injection of tumor cells resulted in significantly larger average tumor volumes on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post tumor-inoculation . this effect was due to the inhibition of ctls, as it was not present in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency  or those depleted of cd8+ t cells. furthermore, pretreatment with stgf-βr inhibited tumor-specific ctl activity in a winn assay. tumors grew to a much larger size when mixed with cd8+ t cells from mice pretreated with stgf-βr than when mixed with cd8+ t cells from mice in the control group:  <dig> mm <dig> vs.  <dig>  mm <dig>  respectively . in addition, fewer cd8+ t cells were generated in ad.e7-immunized mice pretreated with stgf-βr than in mice from the control group:  <dig> % total cd8+ t cells vs.  <dig> %, respectively .


CONCLUSIONS
these studies provide the first in vivo evidence that tgf-β may be necessary for anti-tumor immune responses in certain cancers. this finding has important implications for our understanding of anti-tumor immune responses, the role of tgf-β in the immune system, and the future development of tgf-β inhibiting drugs.
