BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  and is an economically important disease in swine-producing areas. the objective of this study was to screen for effective antisense oligonucleotides  which could inhibit prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells and in pulmonary alveolar macrophages .


RESULTS
nine short as-on sequences against the well-conserved regions of prrsv  were selected. when marc- <dig> cells or pam were infected with prrsv followed by transfection with as-ons, four as-on sequences targeting 5′-utr, orf <dig> or nsp <dig> were found to be the most effective oligonucleotides in decreasing the cytopathic effect  induced by prrsv infection. quantitative pcr and indirect immunofluorescence staining confirmed that orf <dig> levels were significantly reduced both at rna and protein levels. the prrsv titration data furthermore indicated that transfection with as-on yn <dig> could reduce the prrsv titer by 1000-fold compared with controls.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here indicate that dna-based antisense oligonucleotides can effectively inhibit prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells and in pam. furthermore, comparing with the reported hit rates , we achieved a higher success rate . the strategy we took to design the antisense sequences might be applied to select as-ons that more efficiently reduce the expression of target genes.
