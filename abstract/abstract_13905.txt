BACKGROUND
ontological concepts are useful for many different biomedical tasks. concepts are difficult to recognize in text due to a disconnect between what is captured in an ontology and how the concepts are expressed in text. there are many recognizers for specific ontologies, but a general approach for concept recognition is an open problem.


RESULTS
three dictionary-based systems  are evaluated on eight biomedical ontologies in the colorado richly annotated full-text  corpus. over  <dig>  parameter combinations are examined, and best-performing parameters for each system-ontology pair are presented.


CONCLUSIONS
baselines for concept recognition by three systems on eight biomedical ontologies are established . out of the three systems we tested, conceptmapper is generally the best-performing system; it produces the highest f-measure of seven out of eight ontologies. default parameters are not ideal for most systems on most ontologies; by changing parameters f-measure can be increased by up to  <dig> . not only are best performing parameters presented, but suggestions for choosing the best parameters based on ontology characteristics are presented.
