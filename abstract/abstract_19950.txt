BACKGROUND
focal adhesion kinase  is recently reported to regulate insulin resistance by regulating glucose uptake in c2c <dig> skeletal muscle cells. however, the underlying mechanism for fak-mediated glucose transporter- <dig> translocation , responsible for glucose uptake, remains unknown. recently actin remodeling was reported to be essential for glut- <dig> translocation. therefore, we investigated whether fak contributes to insulin-induced actin remodeling and harbor glut- <dig> for glucose transport and whether downregulation of fak affects the remodeling and causes insulin resistance.


RESULTS
to address the issue we employed two approaches: gain of function by overexpressing fak and loss of function by sirna-mediated silencing of fak. we observed that overexpression of fak induces actin remodeling in skeletal muscle cells in presence of insulin. concomitant to this glut- <dig> molecules were also observed to be present in the vicinity of remodeled actin, as indicated by the colocalization studies. fak-mediated actin remodeling resulted into subsequent glucose uptake via pi3k-dependent pathway. on the other hand fak silencing reduced actin remodeling affecting glut- <dig> translocation resulting into insulin resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
the data confirms that fak regulates glucose uptake through actin reorganization in skeletal muscle. fak overexpression supports actin remodeling and subsequent glucose uptake in a pi3k dependent manner. inhibition of fak prevents insulin-stimulated remodeling of actin filaments resulting into decreased glut- <dig> translocation and glucose uptake generating insulin resistance. to our knowledge this is the first study relating fak, actin remodeling, glut- <dig> translocation and glucose uptake and their interrelationship in generating insulin resistance.
