BACKGROUND
the superior temporal gyrus , which encompasses the primary auditory cortex, is believed to be a major anatomical substrate for speech, language and communication. the stg connects to the limbic system , the thalamus and neocortical association areas in the prefrontal cortex, all of which have been implicated in schizophrenia.


RESULTS
to identify altered mrna expression in the superior temporal gyrus  in schizophrenia, oligonucleotide microarrays were used with rna from postmortem stg tissue from  <dig> individuals with schizophrenia and  <dig> matched non-psychiatric controls. overall, there was a trend towards down-regulation in gene expression, and altered expression of genes involved in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, and presynaptic function was identified. to confirm altered expression identified by microarray analysis, the mrna expression levels of four genes, ipla2Î³, pik31r <dig>  lin-7b and atbf <dig>  were semi-quantitatively measured using relative real-time pcr. a number of genes with altered expression in the stg were also shown to have similar changes in expression as shown in our previous study of peripheral blood lymphocytes in schizophrenia.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified altered expression of genes in the stg involved in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment, and to a lesser extent presynaptic function, which further support the notion of these functions playing an integral role in the development of schizophrenia.
