BACKGROUND
h-ns regulates the acid stress resistance. the present study aimed to characterize the h-ns-dependent cascade governing the acid stress resistance pathways and to define the interplay between the different regulators.


RESULTS
we combined mutational, phenotypic and gene expression analyses, to unravel the regulatory hierarchy in acid resistance involving h-ns, rcsb-p/gade complex, hdfr, cadc, adiy regulators, and dna-binding assays to separate direct effects from indirect ones. rcsb-p/gade regulatory complex, the general direct regulator of glutamate-, arginine- and lysine-dependent acid resistance pathways plays a central role in the regulatory cascade. however, h-ns also directly controls specific regulators of these pathways  and genes involved in general stress resistance . finally, we found that in addition to h-ns and rcsb, a third regulator, hdfr, inversely controls glutamate-dependent acid resistance pathway and motility.


CONCLUSIONS
h-ns lies near the top of the hierarchy orchestrating acid response centred on rcsb-p/gade regulatory complex, the general direct regulator of glutamate-, arginine- and lysine-dependent acid resistance pathways.
