BACKGROUND
spindle frap curves depend on the kinetic parameters of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization. the empirical frap curve proposed earlier permits determination of only one such dynamic parameter, commonly called the "tubulin turnover". the aim of our study was to build a frap curve based on an already known kinetic model of microtubule growth.


RESULTS
a numerical expression that describes the distribution of polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubule ends as a function of four kinetic parameters is presented. in addition, a theoretical frap curve for the metaphase spindle is constructed using previously published dynamic parameters.


CONCLUSIONS
the numerical expression we elaborated can replace the empirical frap curve described earlier for a spindle comprising fluorescently marked microtubules. the curve we generated fits well the experimental data.
