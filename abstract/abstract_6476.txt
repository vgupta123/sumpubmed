BACKGROUND
grasspea , a member of the family leguminosae, holds great agronomic potential as grain and forage legume crop in the arid areas for its superb resilience to abiotic stresses such as drought, flood and salinity. the crop could not make much progress through conventional breeding in the past, and there are hardly any detailed molecular biology studies due to paucity of reliable molecular markers representative of the entire genome.


RESULTS
using the  <dig> flx titanium pyrosequencing technique,  <dig>  simple sequence repeat  loci were identified and  <dig>  nonredundant primer pairs were successfully designed, of which  <dig> were randomly selected for validation among 23 l. sativus and one l. cicera accessions of diverse provenance.  <dig> were polymorphic,  <dig> monomorphic, and  <dig> with no pcr product. the number of observed alleles ranged from two to five, the observed heterozygosity from  <dig> to  <dig> , and shannon’s information index ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively. the dendrogram constructed by using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  based on nei's genetic distance, showed obvious distinctions and understandable relationships among the  <dig> accessions.


CONCLUSIONS
the large number of ssr primer pairs developed in this study would make a significant contribution to genomics enabled improvement of grasspea.
