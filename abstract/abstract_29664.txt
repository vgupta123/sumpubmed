BACKGROUND
karns and knight   <cit>  demonstrated by using erp and gamma band oscillatory responses that intermodal attention modulates visual processing at the latency of the early phase of the c <dig> response  thought to be generated in the primary visual cortex. however, the timing of attentional modulation of visual cortex during object-based attention remains a controversial issue.


RESULTS
in this study, eeg recording and loreta source reconstruction were performed. a large number of subjects  and of trial repetitions were used . eeg was recorded from  <dig> scalp sites at a sampling rate of  <dig> hz. four square-wave gratings  were randomly presented in the  <dig> quadrants of the visual field. participants were instructed to pay conjoined attention to a given stimulus quadrant and spatial frequency. the c <dig> and p <dig> sensory-evoked components of erps were quantified by measuring their mean amplitudes across time within  <dig> latency ranges 40- <dig>  60- <dig>  80- <dig>  100- <dig> and 120- <dig> ms.


CONCLUSIONS
early attention effects were found in the form of an enhanced c <dig> response  to frequency-relevant gratings. loreta, within its spatial resolution limits, identified the neural generators of this effect in the striate cortex , among other areas.
