BACKGROUND
glanders is a contagious and fatal zoonotic disease of solipeds caused by the gram-negative bacterium burkholderia  mallei. although regulations call for culling of diseased animals, certain situations e.g. wild life conservation, highly valuable breeding stock, could benefit from effective treatment schemes and post-exposure prophylaxis.


RESULTS
twenty three culture positive glanderous horses were successfully treated during a confined outbreak by applying a treatment protocol of  <dig> weeks duration based on the parenteral administration of enrofloxacin and trimethoprim plus sulfadiazine, followed by the oral administration of doxycycline. induction of immunosupression in six randomly chosen horses after completion of treatment did not lead to recrudescence of disease.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that long term treatment of glanderous horses with a combination of various antibiotics seems to eliminate the agent from the organism. however, more studies are needed to test the effectiveness of this treatment regime on b. mallei strains from different endemic regions. due to its cost and duration, this treatment can only be an option in certain situations and should not replace the current “testing and culling” policy, in conjunction with adequate compensation to prevent spreading of disease.
