BACKGROUND
cytomegaloviruses belong to a large, ancient, genus of dna viruses comprised of a wide array of species-specific strains that occur in diverse array of hosts.

methods
in this study we sequenced the ~ <dig> kb genome of a cytomegalovirus isolated from a mauritius cynomolgus macaque, cycmv mauritius, and compared it to previously sequenced cytomegaloviruses from a cynomolgus macaque of filipino origin  and two from indian rhesus macaques .


RESULTS
though more closely related to cycmv ottawa, cycmv mauritius is less genetically distant from both rhcmv strains than is cycmv ottawa. several individual genes, including homologues of cmv genes rl11b, ul <dig>  ul83b, ul <dig> and a homologue of mammalian cox- <dig>  show a closer relationship between homologues of cycmv mauritius and the rhcmvs than between homologues of cycmv mauritius and cycmv ottawa. a broader phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> cmv strains from eight species recovers evolutionary relationships among viral strains that mirror those amongst the host species, further demonstrating co-evolution of host and virus.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analyses of rhesus and cynomolgus macaque cmv genome sequences demonstrate co-speciation of the virus and host.
