BACKGROUND
acyl-coa binding proteins  bind long chain acyl-coa esters with very high affinity. their possible involvement in fatty acid transportation from the plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum, prior to the formation of triacylglycerol has been suggested. four classes of acbps were identified in arabidopsis thaliana: the small acbps, the large acbps, the ankyrin repeats containing acbps and the kelch motif containing acbps. they differed in structure and in size, and showed multiple important functions. in the present study, brassica napus acbps were identified and characterized.


RESULTS
eight copies of kelch motif acbps were cloned, it showed that b. napus acbps shared high amino acid sequence identity with a. thaliana, brassica rapa and brassica oleracea. furthermore, phylogeny based on domain structure and comparison map showed the relationship and the evolution of acbps within brassicaceae family: acbps evolved into four separate classes with different structure. chromosome locations comparison showed conserved syntenic blocks.


CONCLUSIONS
acbps were highly conserved in brassicaceae. they evolved from a common ancestor, but domain duplication and rearrangement might separate them into four distinct classes, with different structure and functions. otherwise, b. napus inherited kelch motif acbps from ancestor conserving chromosomal location, emphasizing preserved synteny block region. this study provided a first insight for exploring acbps in b. napus, which supplies a valuable tool for crop improvement in agriculture.
