BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis is the foremost oral pathogen of adult periodontitis in humans. however, the mechanisms of bacterial invasion and the resultant destruction of the gingival tissue remain largely undefined.


RESULTS
we report host-p. gingivalis interactions in primary human gingival fibroblast  cells. quantitative immunostaining revealed the need for a high multiplicity of infection for optimal infection. early in infection , p. gingivalis activated the proinflammatory transcription factor nf-kappa b, partly via the pi <dig> kinase/akt pathway. this was accompanied by the induction of cellular anti-apoptotic genes, including bfl- <dig>  boo, bcl-xl, bcl <dig>  mcl- <dig>  bcl-w and survivin. late in infection  the anti-apoptotic genes largely shut down and the pro-apoptotic genes, including nip <dig>  hrk, bak, bik, bok, bax, bad, bim and moap- <dig>  were activated. apoptosis was characterized by nuclear dna degradation and activation of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. use of inhibitors revealed an anti-apoptotic function of nf-kappa b and pi <dig> kinase in p. gingivalis-infected hgf cells. use of a triple protease mutant p. gingivalis lacking three major gingipains  suggested a role of some or all these proteases in myriad aspects of bacteria-gingival interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
the pathology of the gingival fibroblast in p. gingivalis infection is affected by a temporal shift from cellular survival response to apoptosis, regulated by a number of anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules. the gingipain group of proteases affects bacteria-host interactions and may directly promote apoptosis by intracellular proteolytic activation of caspase- <dig>
