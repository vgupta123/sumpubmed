BACKGROUND
one segment of a rna sequence might be paired with another segment of the same rna sequence due to the force of hydrogen bonds. this two-dimensional structure is called the rna sequence's secondary structure. several algorithms have been proposed to predict an rna sequence's secondary structure. these algorithms are referred to as rna folding algorithms.


RESULTS
we develop cache efficient, multicore, and gpu algorithms for rna folding using nussinov's algorithm.


CONCLUSIONS
our cache efficient algorithm provides a speedup between  <dig>  and  <dig>  relative to a naive straightforward single core code. the multicore version of the cache efficient single core algorithm provides a speedup, relative to the naive single core algorithm, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  on a  <dig> core hyperthreaded cpu. our gpu algorithm for the nvidia c <dig> is up to  <dig> times as fast as the naive single core algorithm and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  times as fast as the fastest previously known gpu algorithm for nussinov rna folding.
