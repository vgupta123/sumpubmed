BACKGROUND
caseinolytic proteases  are barrel-shaped self-compartmentalized peptidases involved in eliminating damaged or short-lived regulatory proteins. the mycobacterium tuberculosis  genome contains two genes coding for putative clpps, clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> respectively, that are likely to play a role in the virulence of the bacterium.


RESULTS
we report the first biochemical characterization of clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> peptidases from mtb. both proteins were produced and purified in escherichia coli. use of fluorogenic model peptides of diverse specificities failed to show peptidase activity with recombinant mycobacterial clpp <dig> or clpp <dig>  however, we found that clpp <dig> had a proteolytic activity responsible for its own cleavage after the arg <dig> residue and cleavage of clpp <dig> after the ala <dig> residue. in addition, we showed that the absence of any peptidase activity toward model peptides was not due to an obstruction of the entry pore by the n-terminal flexible extremity of the proteins, nor to an absolute requirement for the clpx or clpc atpase complex. finally, we also found that removing the putative propeptides of clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> did not result in cleavage of model peptides.

we have also shown that recombinant clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> do not assemble in the conventional functional tetradecameric form but in lower order oligomeric species ranging from monomers to heptamers. the concomitant presence of both clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> did not result in tetradecameric assembly. deleting the amino-terminal extremity of clpp <dig> and clpp <dig>  promoted the assembly in higher order oligomeric species, suggesting that the flexible n-terminal extremity of mycobacterial clpps participated in the destabilization of interaction between heptamers.


CONCLUSIONS
despite the conservation of a ser protease catalytic triad in their primary sequences, mycobacterial clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> do not have conventional peptidase activity toward peptide models and display an unusual mechanism of self-assembly. therefore, the mechanism underlying their peptidase and proteolytic activities might differ from that of other clpp proteolytic complexes.
