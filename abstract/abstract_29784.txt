BACKGROUND
the effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood. this study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting.


RESULTS
pedv rna was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected  and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . virus shedding in inf pigs peaked at 1 day post infection  and viral rna levels remained elevated through  <dig> dpi. sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group  became pedv positive after the first movement of study personnel from the inf group. however, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity  and high biosecurity  groups were negative during the  <dig> consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement  when the first trial was terminated.

viral rna was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment  of lb personnel. in addition, at 1 dpm,  <dig> hair/face swabs from mb personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. all swabs of fomite from the hb study personnel were negative.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that indirect pedv transmission through contaminated ppe occurs rapidly  under modeled conditions. biosecurity procedures such as changing ppe, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of pedv transmission between groups of pigs.
