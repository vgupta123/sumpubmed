BACKGROUND
gibbons  are the most diverse group of living apes. they exist as geographically-contiguous species which diverged more rapidly than did their close relatives, the great apes . of the four extant gibbon genera, the evolutionary histories of two polyspecific genera, hylobates and nomascus, have been the particular focus of research but the dna sequence data used was largely derived from the maternally inherited mitochondrial dna  locus.


RESULTS
to investigate the evolutionary relationships and divergence processes of gibbon species, particularly those of the hylobates genus, we produced and analyzed a total of  <dig> â€‰kb dna of sequence at  <dig> biparentally inherited autosomal loci. we find that on average gibbon genera have a high average sequence diversity but a lower degree of genetic differentiation as compared to great ape genera. our multilocus species tree features h. pileatus in a basal position and a grouping of the four sundaic island species . we conducted pairwise comparisons based on an isolation-with-migration  model and detect signals of asymmetric gene flow between h. lar and h. moloch, between h. agilis and h. muelleri, and between n. leucogenys and n. siki.


CONCLUSIONS
our multilocus analyses provide inferences of gibbon evolutionary histories complementary to those based on single gene data. the results of im analyses suggest that the divergence processes of gibbons may be accompanied by gene flow. future studies using analyses of multi-population model with samples of known provenance for hylobates and nomascus species would expand the understanding of histories of gene flow during divergences for these two gibbon genera.
