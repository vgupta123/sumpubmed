BACKGROUND
production of human monoclonal antibodies that exhibit broadly neutralizing activity is needed for preventing hiv- <dig> infection, however only a few such antibodies have been generated till date. isolation of antibodies by the hybridoma technology is a cumbersome process with fewer yields. further, the loss of unstable or slowly growing clones which may have unique binding specificities often occurs during cloning and propagation and the strongly positive clones are often lost. this has been avoided by the process described in this paper, wherein, by combining the strategy of ebv transformation and recombinant dna technology, we constructed human single chain variable fragments  against the third variable region  of the clade c hiv- <dig> envelope.


RESULTS
an antigen specific phage library of  <dig> clones was constructed from the enriched v3- positive antibody secreting ebv transformed cells. by ligation of the digested scfv dna into phagemid vector and bio panning against the hiv- <dig> consensus c and b v <dig> peptides followed by random selection of  <dig> clones, we identified  <dig> clones that showed v <dig> reactivity in phage elisa. dna fingerprinting analysis and sequencing showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> clones were distinct. expression of the positive clones was tested by sds-page and western blot. all the  <dig> anti-v <dig> scfvs showed cross-reactivity against both the clade c and b v <dig> peptides and did not show any reactivity against other unrelated peptides in elisa. preliminary neutralization assays indicated varying degrees of neutralization of clade c and b viruses. ebv transformation, followed by antigen selection of lines to identify specific binders, enabled the selection of phage from un-cloned lines for scfv generation, thus avoiding the problems of hybridoma technology. moreover, as the clones were pretested for antigen binding, a comparatively small library sufficed for the selection of a considerable number of unique antigen binding phage. after selection, the phage clones were propagated in a clonal manner.


CONCLUSIONS
this strategy can be efficiently used and is cost effective for the generation of diverse recombinant antibodies. this is the first study to generate anti-v <dig> scfvs against hiv- <dig> clade c.
