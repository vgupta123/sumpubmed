BACKGROUND
oxygen transport in the hemolymph of many arthropod species is facilitated by large copper-proteins referred to as hemocyanins. arthropod hemocyanins are hexamers or oligomers of hexamers, which are characterized by a high o <dig> transport capacity and a high cooperativity, thereby enhancing o <dig> supply. hemocyanin subunit sequences had been available from horseshoe crabs  and various spiders , but not from any other chelicerate taxon. to trace the evolution of hemocyanins and the emergence of the large hemocyanin oligomers, hemocyanin cdna sequences were obtained from representatives of selected chelicerate classes.


RESULTS
hemocyanin subunits from a sea spider, a scorpion, a whip scorpion and a whip spider were sequenced. hemocyanin has been lost in opiliones, pseudoscorpiones, solifugae and acari, which may be explained by the evolution of trachea . bayesian phylogenetic analysis was used to reconstruct the evolution of hemocyanin subunits and a relaxed molecular clock approach was applied to date the major events. while the sea spider has a simple hexameric hemocyanin, four distinct subunit types evolved before xiphosura and arachnida diverged around  <dig> ma ago, suggesting the existence of a  <dig> × 6mer at that time. subsequently, independent gene duplication events gave rise to the other distinct subunits in each of the  <dig> × 6mer hemocyanin of xiphosura and the  <dig> × 6mer of arachnida. the hemocyanin sequences were used to infer the evolutionary history of chelicerates. the phylogenetic trees support a basal position of pycnogonida, a sister group relationship of xiphosura and arachnida, and a sister group relationship of the whip scorpions and the whip spiders.


CONCLUSIONS
formation of a complex hemocyanin oligomer commenced early in the evolution of euchelicerates. a  <dig> × 6mer hemocyanin consisting of seven subunit types is conserved in most arachnids since more than  <dig> ma, although some entelegyne spiders display selective subunit loss and independent oligomerization. hemocyanins also turned out to be a good marker to trace chelicerate evolution, which is, however, limited by the loss of hemocyanin in some taxa. the molecular clock calculations were in excellent agreement with the fossil record, also demonstrating the applicability of hemocyanins for such approach.
