BACKGROUND
a sensitive, high-throughput method for monitoring pre-mrna splicing on a genomic scale is needed to understand the spectrum of alternatively spliced mrna in human cells.


RESULTS
we adapted molecular inversion probes , a padlock-probe based technology, for the multiplexed capture and quantitation of individual splice events in human tissues. individual mip capture probes can be quantified using either dna microarrays or high-throughput sequencing, which permits independent assessment of each spliced junction. using our methodology we successfully identified 100% of our positive controls and showed that there is a strong correlation between the data from our alternative splicing mip  assay and quantitative pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
the asmip assay provides a sensitive, accurate and multiplexed means for measuring pre-mrna splicing. fully optimized, we estimate that the assay could accommodate a throughput of greater than  <dig>  splice junctions in a single reaction. this would represent a significant improvement over existing technologies.
