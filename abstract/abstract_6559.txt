BACKGROUND
previous studies have linked neurotrophin receptor-interacting mage protein to the bone morphogenic protein signaling pathway and its effect on p <dig> mediated apoptosis of neural progenitor cells via the xiap-tak1-tab <dig> complex. its effect on nf-κb has yet to be explored.


RESULTS
herein we report that nrage, via the same xiap-tak1-tab <dig> complex, is required for the phosphorylation of ikk -α/β and subsequent transcriptional activation of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb. ablation of endogenous nrage by sirna inhibited nf-κb pathway activation, while ablation of tak <dig> and tab <dig> by morpholino inhibited overexpression of nrage from activating nf-κb. finally, cytokine profiling of an nrage over-expressing stable line revealed the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor.


CONCLUSIONS
modulation of nrage expression revealed novel roles in regulating nf-κb activity in the non-canonical bone morphogenic protein signaling pathway. the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor by bone morphogenic protein - <dig> reveals novel crosstalk between an immune cytokine and a developmental pathway.
