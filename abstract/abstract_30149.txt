BACKGROUND
identification of the causative genes of retinitis pigmentosa  is important for the clinical care of patients with rp. however, a comprehensive genetic study has not been performed in korean rp patients. moreover, the genetic heterogeneity found in sensorineural genetic disorders makes identification of pathogenic mutations challenging. therefore, high throughput genetic testing using massively parallel sequencing is needed.


RESULTS
sixty-two korean patients with nonsyndromic rp  who consented to molecular genetic testing were recruited in this study and targeted exome sequencing was applied on  <dig> rp-related genes. causal variants were characterised by selecting exonic and splicing variants, selecting variants with low allele frequency , and discarding the remaining variants with quality below  <dig>  the variants were additionally confirmed by an inheritance pattern and cosegregation test of the families, and the rest of the variants were prioritised using in-silico prediction tools. finally, causal variants were detected from  <dig> of  <dig> familial cases  and  <dig> of  <dig> simplex cases  in total. novel variants were detected in  <dig> of  <dig>  candidate variants. compound heterozygous variants were found in four of  <dig> simplex cases.


CONCLUSIONS
panel-based targeted re-sequencing can be used as an effective molecular diagnostic tool for rp.
