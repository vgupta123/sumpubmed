BACKGROUND
to date, over  <dig> genetically modified  crops are widely cultivated. to comply with regulations developed for genetically modified organisms , including labeling policies, many detection methods for gmo identification and quantification have been developed.


RESULTS
to detect the entrance and exit of unauthorized gm crop events in china, we developed a novel quadruplex real-time pcr method for simultaneous detection and quantification of gm cotton events ghb <dig> and t304- <dig> in cotton-derived products  and the insect-resistance gene cry2ae. the limit of detection was  <dig> copies for ghb <dig> and cry2ae and  <dig> copies for t304- <dig>  the limit of quantification was  <dig> copies for ghb <dig> and cry2ae and  <dig> copies for t304- <dig>  moreover, low bias and acceptable standard deviation and relative standard deviation values were obtained in quantification analysis of six blind samples containing different ghb <dig> and t304- <dig> ingredients.


CONCLUSIONS
the developed quadruplex quantitative method could be used for quantitative detection of two gm cotton events  and cry2ae gene ingredient in cotton derived products.
