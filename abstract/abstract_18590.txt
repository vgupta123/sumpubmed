BACKGROUND
plant roots are the primary site of perception and injury for saline-alkaline stress. the current knowledge of saline-alkaline stress transcriptome is mostly focused on saline  stress and only limited information on alkaline  stress is available.


RESULTS
using affymetrix® soybean genechip®, we conducted transcriptional profiling on glycine soja roots subjected to  <dig> mmol/l nahco <dig> treatment. in a total of  <dig> probe sets,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated at various time points. the number of significantly stress regulated genes increased dramatically after  <dig> h stress treatment and peaked at  <dig> h. go enrichment test revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes were involved in signal transduction, energy, transcription, secondary metabolism, transporter, disease and defence response. we also detected  <dig> micrornas regulated by nahco <dig> stress.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comprehensive wild soybean root transcriptome analysis under alkaline stress. these analyses have identified an inventory of genes with altered expression regulated by alkaline stress. the data extend the current understanding of wild soybean alkali stress response by providing a set of robustly selected, differentially expressed genes for further investigation.
