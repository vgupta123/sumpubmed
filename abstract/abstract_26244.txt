BACKGROUND
multi-drug efflux pumps have been increasingly recognized as a major component of resistance in p. aeruginosa. we have investigated the expression level of efflux systems among clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, regardless of their antimicrobial susceptibility profile.


RESULTS
aztreonam exhibited the highest in vitro activity against the p. aeruginosa isolates studied , whereas susceptibility rates of imipenem and meropenem were both  <dig> %. the mexxy-oprm and mexab-oprm efflux systems were overexpressed in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of isolates studied, respectively. overexpression of the mexef-oprn and mexcd-oprj systems was not observed. ampc β-lactamase was overexpressed in  <dig> % of p. aeruginosa isolates. in addition, decreased oprd expression was also observed in  <dig> % of the whole collection, and in  <dig> % of the imipenem non-susceptible p. aeruginosa clinical isolates. the mbl-encoding genes blaspm- <dig> and blaimp- <dig> were detected in  <dig> % and  <dig> % p. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. the blages- <dig> was detected in  <dig> % of the isolates, while blages- <dig> and blactx-m- <dig> were observed in  <dig> % of the isolates evaluated. in the present study, we have observed that efflux systems represent an adjuvant mechanism for antimicrobial resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
efflux systems in association of distinct mechanisms such as the porin down-regulation, ampc overproduction and secondary β-lactamases play also an important role in the multi-drug resistance phenotype among p. aeruginosa clinical isolates.
