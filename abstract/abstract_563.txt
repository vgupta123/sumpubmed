BACKGROUND
sox <dig> is a developmental transcription factor that is required for differentiation and proliferation in multiple tissues. sox <dig> is overexpressed in many human malignancies, but the precise role of sox <dig> in cancer progression is still not well understood. thus, the identification of additional sox <dig> binding partners is essential for elucidating the mechanism of sox4-mediated effects in cancer progression.


RESULTS
here, we have adapted a one-step affinity purification method that enables rapid purification of sox <dig> complexes via intracellular biotinylation of the amino-terminus of sox <dig> to perform large-scale proteomics analysis. we have discovered that junction plakoglobin  interacts with sox <dig> in both the cytosol and the nucleus and the interaction between sox <dig> and plakoglobin is significantly increased when prostate and breast cancer cells are stimulated with wnt3a. interactions between sox <dig> and plakoglobin were further enhanced by the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin b , suggesting that plakoglobin promotes nuclear export of sox <dig>  the sox4-plakoglobin complex affected the expression of wnt pathway target genes and sox <dig> downstream targets, such as axin <dig>  dicer <dig>  and dhx <dig>  in addition, sox <dig> dna binding activity to the promoters of dicer <dig>  axin <dig>  dhx <dig> and sox <dig> itself was reduced by conditions that promote sox4-plakoglobin complex formation. conditions that enhanced sox4-plakoglobin interactions resulted in reduced transcriptional activity of Î²-catenin luciferase reporters.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that this newly identified interaction between sox <dig> and plakoglobin is inhibitory and provides new insights into the role of sox <dig> in key pathways in cell proliferation, development, and cancer progression.
