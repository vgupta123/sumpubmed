BACKGROUND
all1-fused from chromosome 1q , originally considered as an oncogenic factor, has been implicated in neuronal development; however, its upstream regulatory mechanisms in neural system remained elusive.


RESULTS
our study showed that rest , a key transcription factor in neurodevelopment, could down-regulate the gene expression of af1q. the promoter assay identified a neuron-restrictive silencer element at − <dig> to −363 bp of human af1q promoter. electrophoretic mobility shift assay  and chromatin immunoprecipitation  confirmed the binding of rest to the nrse in af1q gene promoter. additionally, the negative correlation between the expression levels of af1q and rest in mice neurodevelopment supported the negative regulation of af1q by rest and the potential functions of af1q in neurodevelopment.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that rest regulates af1q gene transcription through directly binding to a nrse at − <dig> to −363 bp of af1q promoter.
