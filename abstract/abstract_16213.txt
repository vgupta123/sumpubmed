BACKGROUND
culture of m. bovis from diagnostic specimens is the gold standard for bovine tuberculosis diagnostics in the usa. detection of m. bovis by pcr in tissue homogenates may provide a simple rapid method to complement bacterial culture. a significant impediment to pcr based assays on tissue homogenates is specificity since mycobacteria other than m. bovis may be associated with the tissues.


RESULTS
previously published is <dig> based pcr diagnostic assays, along with one developed in house, were tested against environmental mycobacteria commonly isolated from diagnostic tissues submitted to the national veterinary services laboratory. a real-time pcr assay was developed  that had increased specificity over other is <dig> based assays. of the  <dig> non-tuberculous mycobacteria tested with is6110_t only m. wolinskyi was positive. thirty m. bovis infected tissue homogenates and  <dig> control tissues were used to evaluate the potential for the assay as a diagnostic test. in this small sample, is6110_t detected 20/ <dig> samples from m. bovis infected animals and 0/ <dig> control tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
the is6110_t assay provides a pcr based assay system that is compatible with current diagnostic protocols for the detection of m. bovis in the usa and compliments current testing strategies.
