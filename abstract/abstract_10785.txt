BACKGROUND
dynamic visual exploration of detailed pathway information can help researchers digest and interpret complex mechanisms and genomic datasets.


RESULTS
chibe is a free, open-source software tool for visualizing, querying, and analyzing human biological pathways in biopax format. the recently released version  <dig> can search for neighborhoods, paths between molecules, and common regulators/targets of molecules, on large integrated cellular networks in the pathway commons database as well as in local biopax models. resulting networks can be automatically laid out for visualization using a graphically rich, process-centric notation. profiling data from the cbioportal for cancer genomics and expression data from the gene expression omnibus can be overlaid on these networks.


CONCLUSIONS
chibe’s new capabilities are organized around a genomics-oriented workflow and offer a unique comprehensive pathway analysis solution for genomics researchers. the software is freely available at
http://code.google.com/p/chibe.
