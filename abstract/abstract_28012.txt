BACKGROUND
naturally occurring gastrointestinal disease is an important cause of acute hypoproteinemia in adult horses and hydroxyethyl starch colloid fluid treatment is a component of supportive care in these cases to improve plasma volume and maintain colloid osmotic pressure . the objectives of the present study were to compare  <dig> formulations of high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch and their relative effect on cop, acid-base status, and survival of horses with acute hypoproteinemia secondary to gastrointestinal disease.

methods
twenty adult horses, â‰¥  <dig> year of age, were prospectively enrolled, with informed client consent, if they developed acute hypoproteinemia, defined as a plasma total protein < <dig>  g/dl or albumin < <dig>  g/dl during hospitalization while undergoing treatment for gastrointestinal disease. horses were randomly assigned to receive a rapid infusion of either 6% hydroxyethyl starch in  <dig> % saline or 6% hydroxyethyl starch in lactated ringers solution at a dose of 10ml/kg. venous blood gas analysis, cop, and pcv were evaluated before and after colloid administration.


RESULTS
for both groups, average cop prior to treatment was  <dig>  mmhg  and post colloid treatment was  <dig>  mmhg  . cop was significantly increased with colloid treatment  but this increase was not significantly different between treatment groups. venous ph did not change significantly with treatment. twelve horses survived to hospital discharge and survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups.


CONCLUSIONS
post-treatment cop improved approximately 20% regardless of the formulation used, however, values did not reach the normal range of cop observed in healthy horses. acid-base parameters were not significantly impacted by either treatment. further study is needed to determine how these two products compare with regards to other outcome measures. evaluation of the relative effects of colloid formulation in horses with clinical disease is a future area of interest.
