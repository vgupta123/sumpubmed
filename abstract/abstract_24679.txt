BACKGROUND
previous screening of the substrate repertoires and substrate specificity profiles of granzymes resulted in long substrate lists highly likely containing bystander substrates. here, a recently developed degradomics technology that allows distinguishing efficiently from less efficiently cleaved substrates was applied to study the degradome of mouse granzyme b .


RESULTS
in vitro kinetic degradome analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> mgrb cleavage events,  <dig> of which could be assigned as efficiently targeted ones. previously, cleavage at the iead <dig> tetrapeptide motif of bid was shown to be efficiently and exclusively targeted by human granzyme b  and thus not by mgrb. strikingly, and despite holding an identical p4-p <dig> human bid  cleavage motif, mgrb was shown to efficiently cleave the bcl2/adenovirus e1b 19 kda protein-interacting protein  <dig> or bnip- <dig> at iead <dig>  like bid, bnip- <dig> represents a pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> protein family member and a potential regulator of grb induced cell death. next, in vitro analyses demonstrated the increased efficiency of human and mouse bnip- <dig> cleavage by mgrb as compared to hgrb indicative for differing bid/bnip- <dig> substrate traits beyond the p4-p <dig> iead cleavage motif influencing cleavage efficiency. murinisation of differential primed site residues in hbnip- <dig> revealed that, although all contributing, a single mutation at the p3′ position was found to significantly increase the mgrb/hgrb cleavage ratio, whereas mutating the p1′ position from i29 > t yielded a 4-fold increase in mgrb cleavage efficiency. finally, mutagenesis analyses revealed the composite bnip- <dig> precursor patterns to be the result of alternative translation initiation at near-cognate start sites within the 5′ leader sequence  of bnip- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
despite their high sequence similarity, and previously explained by their distinct tetrapeptide specificities observed, the substrate repertoires of mouse and human granzymes b only partially overlap. here, we show that the substrate sequence context beyond the p4-p <dig> positions can influence orthologous granzyme b cleavage efficiencies to an unmatched extent. more specifically, in bnip- <dig>  the identical and hgrb optimal iead tetrapeptide substrate motif is targeted highly efficiently by mgrb, while this tetrapeptide motif is refractory towards mgrb cleavage in bid.
