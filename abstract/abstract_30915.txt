BACKGROUND
the transmembrane presenilin  proteins, psen <dig> and psen <dig>  have been proposed to be the catalytic components of the Î³-secretase protein complex, which is an intramembranous multimeric protease involved in development, cell regulatory processes, and neurodegeneration in alzheimer's disease. here we describe the sequencing, chromosomal mapping, and polymorphism analysis of psen <dig> and psen <dig> in the domestic pig .


RESULTS
the porcine presenilin proteins showed a high degree of homology over their entire sequences to the psens from mouse, bovine, and human. psen <dig> and psen <dig> transcription was examined during prenatal development of the brain stem, hippocampus, cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum at embryonic days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which revealed distinct temporal- and tissue-specific expression profiles. furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of psen <dig> and psen <dig> showed similar localization of the proteins predominantly in neuronal cells in all examined brain areas.


CONCLUSIONS
the data provide evidence for structural and functional conservation of psens in mammalian lineages, and may suggest that the high sequence similarity and colocalization of psen <dig> and psen <dig> in brain tissue reflect a certain degree of functional redundancy. the data show that pigs may provide a new animal model for detailed analysis of the developmental functions of the psens.
