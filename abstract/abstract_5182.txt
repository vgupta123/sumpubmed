BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis  causes death of 2â€“ <dig> million people every year. the persistence of the pathogenic mycobacteria inside the macrophage occurs through modulation of host cell signaling which allows them, unlike the other non-pathogenic species, to survive inside the host. the secretory proteins of m. tuberculosis have gained attention in recent years both as vaccine candidates and diagnostic tools; they target the immune system and trigger a putatively protective response; however, they may also be involved in the clinical symptoms of the disease.


RESULTS
our studies showed that rd-1-encoded secretory protein esat- <dig> is involved in modulation of the mitogen-activated protein  kinase-signaling pathway inside the macrophage. esat- <dig> induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/ <dig>  in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus, which normally is the case for map kinases. esat- <dig> also antagonized lps-induced erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in the nucleus. stimulation of cells by esat- <dig> along with sodium orthovanadate  restored phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus, suggesting active dephosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> by some putative phosphatase in the nucleus. further, esat- <dig> was found to down regulate the expression of lps-inducible gene c-myc in an erk1/2-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed the effect of secretory proteins of m. tuberculosis in the modulation of macrophage signaling pathways particularly erk1/ <dig> map kinase pathway. this modulation appears to be achieved by limiting the erk1/ <dig> activation in the nucleus which ultimately affects the macrophage gene expression. this could be a mechanism by which secretory proteins of mtb might modulate gene expression inside the macrophages.
