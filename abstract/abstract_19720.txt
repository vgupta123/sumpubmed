BACKGROUND
the tec-family kinase itk plays an important role during t-cell activation and function, and controls also conventional versus innate-like t-cell development. we have characterized the transcriptome of itk-deficient cd3+ t-cells, including cd4+ and cd8+ subsets, using affymetrix microarrays.


RESULTS
the largest difference between itk-/- and wt cd3+ t-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. compared to anti-cd3-stimulation, anti-cd3/cd <dig> significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the cd <dig> co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of itk. the signatures of cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total cd3+ cells. cyclosporin a -treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of tcr-mediated calcineurin/nfat-activation is dependent on itk. bioinformatic analysis of nfat-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by itk-deficiency and csa-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed nfatc1-binding to the bub <dig>  il7r, ctla2a, ctla2b, and schlafen <dig> genes. finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of itk-deficient t-cells with that of btk-deficient b-cells and a common set of transcripts was found.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our study provides a general overview about the global transcriptional changes in the absence of itk.
