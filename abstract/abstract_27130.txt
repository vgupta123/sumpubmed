BACKGROUND
apart from single nucleotide polymorphism , copy number variation  is another important type of genetic variation, which may affect growth traits and play key roles for the production of beef cattle. to date, no genome-wide association study  for cnv and body traits in beef cattle has been reported, so the present study aimed to investigate this type of association in one of the most important cattle subspecies: bos indicus .


RESULTS
we have used intensity data from over  <dig>  snp probes across the bovine genome to detect common cnvs in a sample of  <dig> nellore cattle, and performed gwas between the detected cnvs and nine growth traits. after filtering for frequency and length, a total of  <dig> cnvs ranging from 894 bp to  <dig> ,088 bp were kept and tested as predictors for each growth trait using linear regression analysis with principal components correction. there were  <dig> significant associations identified among  <dig> cnvs and seven body traits after false discovery rate correction . among the  <dig> cnvs, three were significant or marginally significant for all the traits. we have compared the locations of associated cnvs with quantitative trait locus and the refgene database, and found two sets of  <dig> cnvs overlapping with either known qtls or genes, respectively. the gene overlapping with cnv <dig>  kcnj <dig>  is a functional candidate for muscle development and plays critical roles in muscling traits.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first cnv-based gwas of growth traits using high density snp microarray data in cattle. we detected  <dig> cnvs significantly associated with seven growth traits and one of them  may be involved in growth traits through kcnj <dig>
