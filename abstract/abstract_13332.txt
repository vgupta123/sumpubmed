BACKGROUND
the clinical use of autologous platelet concentrates  on the field of regenerative therapy, in the last decade has been the subject of several studies especially in equine medicine and surgery. the objectives of this study was: 1) to describe and compare the cellular population in whole blood, lower fraction  and upper fraction  of platelet concentrates, 2) to measure and compare the transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  concentration in plasma and both platelet concentrates after be activated with calcium gluconate or batroxobin plus calcium gluconate and, 3) to determine correlations between cell counts in platelet concentrates and concentrations of tgf-β <dig>  blood samples were taken from  <dig> dogs for complete blood count, plasma collection and platelet concentrates preparation. the platelet concentrates  were arbitrarily divided into two fractions, specifically, pc-a  and pc-b . the platelet concentrates were analyzed by hemogram. after activated with calcium gluconate or batroxobin plus calcium gluconate, tgf-β <dig> concentration was determined in supernatants of platelet concentrates and plasma.


RESULTS
there were differences statistically significant  for the platelet count and leukocyte count and tgf-β <dig> concentration between whole blood, plasma and both platelet concentrates. a significant correlation was found between the number of platelets in both platelet concentrates and tgf-β <dig> concentration. platelet collection efficiency was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for pc-a and pc-b, respectively. tgf-β <dig> concentration efficiency for pc activated with calcium gluconate was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, for pc-a and pc-b, respectively. pc activated with batroxobin plus cg showed  <dig> % and  <dig> % for pc-a and pc-b, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the methodology used in this study allows the concentration of a number of platelets and tgf-β <dig> that might be acceptable for a biological effect for clinical or experimental use as a regenerative therapy in dogs.
