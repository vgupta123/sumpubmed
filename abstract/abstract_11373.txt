BACKGROUND
the tetracycline-inducible gene regulation system is a powerful tool that allows temporal and dose-dependent regulation of target transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. several tetracycline-inducible transgenic mouse models have been described with ubiquitous or tissue-specific expression of tetracycline-transactivator , reverse tetracycline-transactivator  or tet repressor . here we describe a tet-on transgenic rat that ubiquitously expresses rtta-m <dig> driven by the murine rosa  <dig> promoter.


RESULTS
the homozygous rat line  generated by lentiviral vector injection, has a single integration site and was derived from the offspring of a genetic mosaic founder with multiple transgene integrations. the rtta-m <dig> transgene integrated into an intron of a putative gene on chromosome  <dig> and does not appear to affect the tissue-specificity or expression of that gene. fibroblasts from the rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats were transduced with a teto7/cmv-egfp lentivirus and exhibited doxycycline dose-dependent expression of the egfp reporter transgene, in vitro. in addition, doxycycline-inducible egfp expression was observed, in vivo, when the teto7/cmv-egfp lentivirus was injected into testis, kidney and muscle tissues of rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats.


CONCLUSIONS
this conditional expression rat model may have application for transgenic overexpression or knockdown studies of gene function in development, disease and gene therapy.
