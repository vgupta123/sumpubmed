BACKGROUND
a complete and hardened endocarp is a typical trait of drupe fruits. however, the ‘liehe’  apricot cultivar has a thin, soft, cleavable endocarp that represents  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the thickness and lignin content, respectively, of the ‘jinxihong’  apricot . to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the le apricot phenotype, comparative transcriptomes of prunus armeniaca l. were sequenced using illumina hiseq™  <dig> 


RESULTS
in this study, we identified  <dig>  unigenes including  <dig>  genes >1000 bp and  <dig>  genes with gene function annotation. pathway enrichment and expression patterns were used to characterize differentially expression genes. the degs encoding key enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were significantly down-regulated in le apricot. for example, cad gene expression levels, encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, were only  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in le apricot compared with jg cultivar at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  49 days after full bloom . furthermore, transcription factors regulating secondary wall and lignin biosynthesis were identified. especially for secondary wall thickening promoting factor  <dig> , its expression levels in le apricot were merely  <dig> % and  <dig> % compared with jg cultivar at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our comparative transcriptome analysis was used to understand the molecular mechanisms underlie the endocarp-cleaving phenotype in le apricot. this new apricot genomic resource and the candidate genes provide a useful reference for further investigating the lignification during development of apricot endocarp. transcription factors such as nst <dig> may regulate genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway and affect development and lignification of the endocarp.
