BACKGROUND
prevalence of fibroproliferative diseases, including chronic kidney disease is rapidly increasing and has become a major public health problem worldwide. fibroproliferative diseases are characterized by increased expression of α smooth muscle actin  that belongs to the family of the six conserved actin isoforms showing high degree homology. the aim of the present study was to develop real-time pcrs that clearly discriminate α-sma and ß-actin from other actin isoforms.


RESULTS
real-time pcrs using self-designed mouse, human and rat specific α-sma or ß-actin primer pairs resulted in the specific amplification of the artificial dna templates corresponding to mouse, human or rat α-sma or ß-actin, however ß-actin showed cross-reaction with the housekeeping γ-cyto-actin. we have shown that the use of improperly designed literary primer pairs significantly affects the results of pcrs measuring mrna expression of α-sma or ß-actin in the kidney of mice underwent uuo.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed a set of carefully designed primer pairs and pcr conditions to selectively determine the expression of mouse, human or rat α-sma and ß-actin isoforms. we demonstrated the importance of primer specificity in experiments where the results are normalized to the expression of ß-actin especially when fibrosis and thus increased expression of α-sma is occur.
