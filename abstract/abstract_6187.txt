BACKGROUND
tetraspanins are small membrane proteins that belong to a superfamily encompassing  <dig> members in human and mouse. these proteins act as organizers of membrane-signalling complexes. so far only two tetraspanin families have been identified in fungi. these are pls <dig>  which is required for pathogenicity of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes, magnaporthe grisea, botrytis cinerea and colletotrichum lindemuthianum, and tsp <dig>  whose function is unknown. in this report, we describe a third family of tetraspanins  and a new family of tetraspanin-like proteins  in fungi. we also describe expression of some of these genes in m. grisea and a basidiomycete, laccaria bicolor, and also their functional analysis in m. grisea.


RESULTS
the exhaustive search for tetraspanins in fungal genomes reveals that higher fungi  contain three families of tetraspanins  with different distribution amongst phyla. pls <dig> is found in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, whereas tsp <dig> is restricted to basidiomycetes and tsp <dig> to ascomycetes. a unique copy of each of pls <dig> and tsp <dig> was found in ascomycetes in contrast to tsp <dig>  which has several paralogs in the basidiomycetes, coprinus cinereus and laccaria bicolor. a tetraspanin-like family  was also identified in ascomycetes. transcriptional analyses in various tissues of l. bicolor and m. grisea showed that pls <dig> and tsp <dig> are expressed in all tissues in l. bicolor and that tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> are overexpressed in the sexual fruiting bodies  and mycelia of m. grisea, suggesting that these genes are not pseudogenes. phenotypic analysis of gene replacementmutants Δtsp <dig> and Δtpl <dig> of m. grisea revealed a reduction of the pathogenicity only on rice, in contrast to Δpls <dig> mutants, which are completely non-pathogenic on barley and rice.


CONCLUSIONS
a new tetraspanin family  and a tetraspanin-like protein family  have been identified in fungi. functional analysis by gene replacement showed that these proteins, as well as pls <dig>  are involved in the infection process of the plant pathogenic fungus m. grisea. the next challenge will be to decipher the role of tetraspanins in a range of symbiotic, saprophytic and human pathogenic fungi.
