BACKGROUND
compared with other populus species, populus euphratica oliv. exhibits better tolerance to abiotic stress, especially those involving extreme temperatures. however, little is known about gene regulation and signaling pathways involved in low temperature stress responses in this species. recent development of illumina/solexa-based deep-sequencing technologies has accelerated the study of global transcription profiling under specific conditions. to understand the gene network controlling low temperature perception in p. euphratica, we performed transcriptome sequencing using solexa sequence analysis to generate a leaf transcriptome at a depth of  <dig> gigabases for each sample.


RESULTS
using the trinity method,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality trimmed reads were assembled into a non-redundant set and  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp were generated. after performing functional annotations by aligning all-unigenes with public protein databases,  <dig>  unigenes were annotated. differentially expressed genes were investigated using the fpkm method by applying the benjamini and hochberg corrections. overall,  <dig>  transcripts were identified as differentially expressed unigenes in at least two samples and  <dig> were assigned as unigenes expressed differently in all three samples. in 4°c-treated sample and -4°c-treated sample,  <dig>  and  <dig> differently expressed unigenes were detected at an estimated absolute log2-fold change of >  <dig>  respectively. among them, the respective number of up-regulated unigenes in c <dig> and f <dig> sample was  <dig>  and  <dig>  while the respective number of down-regulated ungenes is  <dig> and  <dig>  to increase our understanding of these differentially expressed genes, we performed gene ontology enrichment and metabolic pathway enrichment analyses. a large number of early cold -responsive genes were identified, suggesting that a multitude of transcriptional cascades function in cold perception. analyses of multiple cold-responsive genes, transcription factors, and some key transduction components involved in aba and calcium signaling revealed their potential function in low temperature responses in p. euphratica.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a global transcriptome picture of p. euphratica under low temperature stress. the potential cold stress related transcripts identified in this study provide valuable information for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of low temperature perception in p. euphratica.
