BACKGROUND
mirnas are known to play important regulatory roles throughout plant development. until recently, nearly all the mirnas in maize were identified by comparative analysis to mirnas sequences of other plant species, such as rice and arabidopsis.


RESULTS
to find new mirna in this important crop, small rnas from mixed tissues were sequenced, resulting in over  <dig> million unique sequences. our sequencing effort validated  <dig> of the  <dig> known maize mirna families, including  <dig> unique mirnas. using a newly established criterion, based on the precision of mirna processing from precursors, we identified  <dig> novel mirnas in maize. these mirnas can be grouped into  <dig> families,  <dig> of which have not been identified in any other species. five new mirnas were validated by northern blot. moreover, we found targets for  <dig> of the  <dig> new mirnas. the targets of two of these newly identified mirnas were confirmed by 5'race.


CONCLUSIONS
we have implemented a novel method of identifying mirna by measuring the precision of mirna processing from precursors. using this method,  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> potential mirnas have been identified in maize.
