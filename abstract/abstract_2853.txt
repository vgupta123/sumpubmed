BACKGROUND
latent tuberculosis infection  relies on a homeostasis of macrophages and mycobacterium tuberculosis . the small heat shock protein, mtb hsp <dig>  , plays an important role in mtb persistence within macrophages. however, the mechanism of ltbi remains elusive. the aim of this study was to delineate ltbi-related mirna expression in u <dig> macrophages expressing mtb hsp <dig>  protein. u <dig> macrophages were infected with an integrase-deficient lentivirus vector to transiently express mtb hsp <dig> , and green fluorescent protein  as a control. we used a microrna  microarray chip containing more than  <dig> probes to identify the significant differentially expressed mirnas in the infected u <dig> cells, and employed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  for validation. furthermore, we confirmed these candidate ltbi-related mirnas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with ltbi and in healthy control individuals. functional annotation prediction of mirna target genes and pathway enrichment analyses were used to explore the putative links between these mirnas and ltbi.


RESULTS
analysis of the mirna expression profile identified  <dig> mirnas that were differentially expressed in u <dig> macrophages expressing mtb hsp <dig>  compared with the control expressing gfp. the expression level of seven mirnas  were validated by qrt-pcr. the expression level of four mirnas  in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples from ltbi and healthy participants reflected the altered patterns observed in the microarray profile. the bioinformatic analyses suggest that the mirnas may regulate mtb latent infection by affecting the development of macrophage cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that mirna expression may play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of ltbi, and this would increase our understanding of the molecular basis of hsp <dig> -facilitated mtb survival in macrophages.
