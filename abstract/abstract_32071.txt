BACKGROUND
polysaccharopeptide , isolated from coriolus versicolor cov- <dig> strain, is a protein-bound polysaccharide widely used as immunoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy. although the immunomodulatory activity of psp has been well established, the precise molecule mechanisms of its biological activity have yet to be fully elucidated.

methods
in the present study, we first investigated the immunomodulatory activity of psp in peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/10j  and c57bl/10sccr  mice carrying a defective toll-like receptor- <dig>  gene and then evaluated psp for its effect on tumor inhibition rates and the immune organ index in above two different strains of mice. in addition, psp were also evaluated for its activation of tlr <dig>  tlr4-downstream molecules  in spleens of tumor-bearing c57bl/10j  and c57bl/10sccr  mice.


RESULTS
the results showed that psp had adjuvant activities in stimulating expressions of cytokines as well as tlr <dig>  traf <dig>  phosphorylation of nf-κb p <dig> transcription factors and phosphorylation of c-jun  in peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/10j  mice but not from c57bl/10sccr  mice. in vivo psp as well as adriamycin  decreased the mean weights of tumors compared with normal saline and psp increased thymus index and spleen index relative to adm in tumor-bearing c57bl/10j  mice but not in c57bl/10sccr  mice.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that psp activates peritoneal macrophages in vitro via tlr <dig> signaling pathway and psp functions its immunoregulatory effect in vivo also via tlr <dig> signaling pathway. these data strongly suggest tlr <dig> signaling pathway is involved in psp-mediated immunomodulatory activities.
