BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins  belong to the tgf-β superfamily and are secreted proteins with pleiotropic roles in many different cell types. a potential role of bmp- <dig> in the immune system has been implied by various studies of malignant and rheumatoid diseases. in the present study, we explored the role of bmp- <dig> in normal human peripheral blood b cells.


RESULTS
the b cells were found to express bmp type i and type ii receptors and bmp- <dig> rapidly induced phosphorylation of smad1/5/ <dig>  furthermore, smad-phosphorylation was followed by upregulation of id <dig> mrna and id <dig> protein, whereas id <dig> and id <dig> expression was not affected. furthermore, we found that bmp- <dig> had an antiproliferative effect both in naïve  and memory b cells  stimulated with anti-igm alone or the combined action of anti-igm and cd40l. additionally, bmp- <dig> induced cell death in activated memory b cells. importantly, the antiproliferative effect of bmp- <dig> in b-cells was completely neutralized by the natural antagonist, noggin. furthermore, b cells were demonstrated to upregulate bmp- <dig> mrna upon stimulation with anti-igm.


CONCLUSIONS
in mature human b cells, bmp- <dig> inhibited cell growth, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of smad1/5/ <dig> followed by an upregulation of id <dig>
