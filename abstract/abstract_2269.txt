BACKGROUND
one of the fundamental measures of molecular genetic variation is the watterson’s estimator , which is based on the number of segregating sites. the estimation of θ is unbiased only under neutrality and constant population growth. it is well known that the estimation of θ is biased when these assumptions are violated. however, the effects of sample size in modulating the bias was not well appreciated.


RESULTS
we examined this issue in detail based on large-scale exome data and robust simulations. our investigation revealed that sample size appreciably influences θ estimation and this effect was much higher for constrained genomic regions than that of neutral regions. for instance, θ estimated for synonymous sites using  <dig> human exomes was  <dig>  times higher than that obtained using  <dig> exomes. however, this difference was  <dig>  times for the nonsynonymous sites of the same data. we observed a positive correlation between the rate of increase in θ estimates  and the magnitude of selection pressure. for example, θ estimated for the nonsynonymous sites of highly constrained genes  using  <dig> exomes was  <dig>  times higher than that estimated using  <dig> exomes. in contrast this difference was only  <dig> times for the less constrained genes .


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study reveal the extent of underestimation owing to small sample sizes and thus emphasize the importance of sample size in estimating a number of population genomic parameters. our results have serious implications for neutrality tests such as tajima d, fu-li d and those based on the mcdonald and kreitman test: neutrality index and the fraction of adaptive substitutions. for instance, use of  <dig> exomes produced  <dig>  times higher proportion of adaptive substitutions compared to that obtained using  <dig> exomes .
