BACKGROUND
several cases of legionellosis have been diagnosed in the same french thermal spa in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  l. pneumophila serogroup  <dig>  strains have been isolated from several patients, but the source of contamination was not identified despite the presence of different lp <dig> in water samples of the three natural springs feeding the spa at this period.


RESULTS
our strategy was to investigate l. pneumophila  strains from natural biofilms developed in a sulphur-rich warm spring of this contaminated site. biofilm analysis revealed the presence of three lp serogroups . surprisingly, lp <dig> and lp <dig> were not reported in the previous described studies from water samples. besides, the new seven lp <dig> we isolated exhibit a high molecular diversity and have been differentiated in five classes according to their dna genome patterns obtained by pfge and mip sequences. it must be noted that these dna patterns are original and unknown in databases. interestingly, the  <dig> lp environmental strains we isolated display a higher cytotoxicity and virulence towards the amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii than those of known lp <dig> epidemic strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the characteristics of legionella pneumophila lp <dig> strains isolated from the warm spring are in agreement with their presence in biofilms and their probable long-term persistence in this ecosystem.
