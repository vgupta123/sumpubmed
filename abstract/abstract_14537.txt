BACKGROUND
flower opening is an important process in the life cycle of flowering plants and is influenced by various endogenous and environmental factors. our previous work demonstrated that rose  flowers are highly sensitive to dehydration during flower opening and the water recovery process after dehydration induced ethylene production rapidly in flower gynoecia. in addition, this temporal- and spatial-specific ethylene production is attributed to a transient but robust activation of the rose map kinase6-acc synthase <dig>  cascade in gynoecia. however, the upstream component of rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> is unknown, although rhmkk <dig> , a rose homologue of arabidopsis mkk <dig>  could activate rhmpk <dig> in vitro. in this study, we monitored rhmkk2/4/5/ <dig> expression, the potential upstream kinase to rhmpk <dig>  in rose gynoecia during dehydration and rehydration.


RESULTS
we found only rhmkk <dig> was rapidly and strongly induced by rehydration. silencing of rhmkk <dig> significantly decreased rehydration-triggered ethylene production. consistently, the expression of several ethylene-responsive genes was down regulated in the petals of rhmkk9-silenced flowers. moreover, we detected the dna methylation level in the promoter and gene body of rhmkk <dig> by chop-pcr. the results showed that rehydration specifically elevated the dna methylation level on the rhmkk <dig> gene body, whereas it resulted in hypomethylation in its promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that rhmkk <dig> possibly acts as the upstream component of the rhmkk9-rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> cascade and is responsible for water recovery-triggered ethylene production in rose gynoecia, and epigenetic dna methylation is involved in the regulation of rhmkk <dig> expression by rehydration.
