BACKGROUND
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput dna sequencing  offers high resolution, genome-wide analysis of dna-protein interactions. however, current standard methods require abundant starting material in the range of 1â€“ <dig> million cells per immunoprecipitation, and remain a bottleneck to the acquisition of biologically relevant epigenetic data. using a chip-seq protocol optimised for low cell numbers , we examined the performance of the chip-seq technique on a series of decreasing cell numbers.


RESULTS
we present an enhanced native chip-seq method tailored to low cell numbers that represents a 200-fold reduction in input requirements over existing protocols. the protocol was tested over a range of starting cell numbers covering three orders of magnitude, enabling determination of the lower limit of the technique. at low input cell numbers, increased levels of unmapped and duplicate reads reduce the number of unique reads generated, and can drive up sequencing costs and affect sensitivity if chip is attempted from too few cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the optimised method presented here considerably reduces the input requirements for performing native chip-seq. it extends the applicability of the technique to isolated primary cells and rare cell populations , and in many cases will alleviate the need for cell culture and any associated alteration of epigenetic marks. however, this study highlights a challenge inherent to chip-seq from low cell numbers: as cell input numbers fall, levels of unmapped sequence reads and pcr-generated duplicate reads rise. we discuss a number of solutions to overcome the effects of reducing cell number that may aid further improvements to chip performance.
