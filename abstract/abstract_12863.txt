BACKGROUND
the strenuous procurement of cultured human hepatocytes and their short lives have constrained the cell culture model of cytochrome p <dig>  induction, xenobiotic biotransformation, and hepatotoxicity. the development of continuous non-tumorous cell line steadily containing hepatocyte phenotypes would substitute the primary hepatocytes for these studies.


RESULTS
the hepatocyte-like cells have been developed from htert plus bmi-1-immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells to substitute the primary hepatocytes. the hepatocyte-like cells had polygonal morphology and steadily produced albumin, glycogen, urea and ugt1a <dig> beyond  <dig> months while maintaining proliferative capacity. although these hepatocyte-like cells had low basal expression of cyp <dig> isotypes, their expressions could be extensively up regulated to  <dig> folds upon the exposure to enzyme inducers. their inducibility outperformed the classical hepg <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the hepatocyte-like cells contained the markers of hepatocytes including cyp <dig> isotypes. the high inducibility of cyp <dig> transcripts could serve as a sensitive model for profiling xenobiotic-induced expression of cyp <dig>
