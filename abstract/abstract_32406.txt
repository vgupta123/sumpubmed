BACKGROUND
cre-mediated site-specific integrative recombination in mouse embryonic stem  cells is a useful tool for genome engineering, allowing precise and repeated site-specific integration. to promote the integrative reaction, a left element/right element  mutant strategy using a pair of lox sites with mutations in the le or re of the lox sequence has previously been developed. recombination between le and re mutant lox produces a wild-type loxp site as well as an le+re double mutant lox site, which has mutations in both sides and less affinity to cre, resulting in stable integration. we previously demonstrated successful integrative recombination using lox <dig>  and lox <dig>  in es cells. recently, other le/re mutant lox sites showing higher recombination efficiency in escherichia coli have been reported. however, their recombination efficiency in mammalian cells remains to be analyzed.


RESULTS
using es cells, we compared six re mutant lox sites, focusing on their recombination efficiency with lox <dig>  all of the re mutant lox sites showed similar recombination efficiency. we then analyzed the stability of the recombined product, i.e., the le+re double mutant lox site, under continuous and strong cre activity in es cells. two re mutants, loxjtz <dig> and loxkr <dig>  produced more stable le+re double mutant lox than did the lox66/ <dig> double mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
the two mutant re lox sites, loxjtz <dig> and loxkr <dig>  are more suitable than lox <dig> for cre-mediated integration or inversion in es cells.
