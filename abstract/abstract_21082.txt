BACKGROUND
echinocandins are nonribosomal lipopeptides produced by ascommycete fungi. due to their strong inhibitory effect on fungal cell wall biosynthesis and lack of human toxicity, they have been developed to an important class of antifungal drugs. since  <dig>  the biosynthetic gene clusters of most of the main echinocandin variants have been characterized. especially the comparison of the clusters allows a deeper insight for the biosynthesis of these complex structures.


RESULTS
in the genome of the echinocandin b producer aspergillus nidulans nrrl  <dig> we have identified a gene cluster  that encodes echinocandin biosynthesis. sequence analyses showed that ani is clearly delimited from the genomic context and forms a monophyletic lineage with the other echinocandin gene clusters. importantly, we found that the disjunct genomic location of the echinocandin b gene cluster in a. pachycristatus nrrl  <dig> on two separate subclusters, ecd and hty, at two loci was likely an artifact of genome misassembly in the absence of a reference sequence. we show that both sequences can be aligned resulting a single cluster with a gene arrangement collinear compared to other clusters of aspergillus section nidulantes. the reassembled gene cluster  is identical to a putative gene cluster  that was previously deposited at the ncbi as a sequence from a. delacroxii nrrl  <dig>  pcr amplification of a part of the gene cluster resulted a sequence that was very similar , but not identical to that of ae.


CONCLUSIONS
the echinocandin b biosynthetic cluster from a. nidulans nrrl  <dig>  is particularly similar to that of a. pachycristatus nrrl  <dig> . ecd/hty was originally reported as two disjunct sub-clusters ecd and hty, but is in fact a continuous sequence with the same gene order as in ani. according to sequences of pcr products amplified from genomic dna, the echinocandin b producer a. delacroxii nrrl  <dig> is closely related to a. pachycristatus nrrl  <dig>  a pcr-product from the gene cluster was very similar, but clearly distinct from the sequence published for a. delacroxii nrrl  <dig> at the ncbi . as the ncbi entry is virtually identical with the re-assembled ecd/hty cluster, it is likely that it originates from a. pachycristatus nrrl  <dig> rather than a. delacroxii nrrl  <dig>
