BACKGROUND
bacteria of the genus sulfobacillus are found worldwide as members of microbial communities that accelerate sulfide mineral dissolution in acid mine drainage environments , acid-rock drainage environments , as well as in industrial bioleaching operations. despite their frequent identification in these environments, their role in biogeochemical cycling is poorly understood.


RESULTS
here we report draft genomes of five species of the sulfobacillus genus  reconstructed by cultivation-independent sequencing of biofilms sampled from the richmond mine . three of these species  have no cultured representatives while amdsba <dig> is a strain of s. benefaciens, and amdsba <dig> a strain of s. thermosulfidooxidans. we analyzed the diversity of energy conservation and central carbon metabolisms for these genomes and previously published sulfobacillus genomes. pathways of sulfur oxidation vary considerably across the genus, including the number and type of subunits of putative heterodisulfide reductase complexes likely involved in sulfur oxidation. the number and type of nickel-iron hydrogenase proteins varied across the genus, as does the presence of different central carbon pathways. only the amdsba <dig> genome encodes a dissimilatory nitrate reducatase and only the amdsba <dig> and s. thermosulfidooxidans genomes encode assimilatory nitrate reductases. within the genus, amdsba <dig> is unusual in that its electron transport chain includes a cytochrome bc type complex, a unique cytochrome c oxidase, and two distinct succinate dehydrogenase complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, the results significantly expand our understanding of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen metabolism within the sulfobacillus genus.
