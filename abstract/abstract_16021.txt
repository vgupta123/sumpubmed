BACKGROUND
the novel antidepressant agomelatine, a melatonergic mt1/mt <dig> agonist combined with 5-ht2c serotonin antagonist properties, showed antidepressant action in preclinical and clinical studies. there is a general agreement that the therapeutic action of antidepressants needs the activation of slow-onset adaptations in downstream signalling pathways finally regulating neuroplasticity. in the last several years, particular attention was given to camp-responsive element binding protein -related pathways, since it was shown that chronic antidepressants increase creb phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, through the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent  and mitogen activated protein kinase cascades .

aim of this work was to analyse possible effects of chronic agomelatine on time-dependent changes of different intracellular signalling pathways in hippocampus and prefrontal/frontal cortex of male rats. to this end, measurements were performed 1 h or 16 h after the last agomelatine or vehicle injection.


RESULTS
we have found that in naïve rats chronic agomelatine, contrary to traditional antidepressants, did not increase creb phosphorylation, but modulates the time-dependent regulation of mapk/erk1/ <dig> and akt/glycogen synthase kinase- <dig>  pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the intracellular molecular mechanisms modulated by chronic agomelatine may be partly different from those of traditional antidepressants and involve the time-dependent regulation of mapk/erk1/ <dig> and akt/gsk- <dig> signalling pathways. this could exert a role in the antidepressant efficacy of the drug.
