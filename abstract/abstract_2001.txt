BACKGROUND
the gene content of a diverse group of  <dig> unique escherichia coli and shigella isolates was determined using the affymetrix genechipÂ® e. coli genome  <dig>  array, originally designed for transcriptome analysis, as a genotyping tool. the probe set design utilized by this array provided the opportunity to determine the gene content of each strain very accurately and reliably. this array constitutes  <dig>  independent genes representing four individual e. coli genomes, therefore providing the ability to survey genes of several different pathogen types. the entire ecor collection,  <dig> ehec-like isolates, and a diverse set of isolates from our fda strain repository were included in our analysis.


RESULTS
from this study we were able to define sets of genes that correspond to, and therefore define, the ehec pathogen type. furthermore, our sampling of  <dig> unique strains of o157:h <dig> showed the ability of this array to discriminate between closely related strains. we found that individual strains of o157:h <dig> differed, on average, by  <dig> probe sets. finally, we describe an analysis method that utilizes the power of the probe sets to determine accurately the presence/absence of each gene represented on this array.


CONCLUSIONS
these elements provide insights into understanding the microbial diversity that exists within extant e. coli populations. moreover, these data demonstrate that this novel microarray-based analysis is a powerful tool in the field of molecular epidemiology and the newly emerging field of microbial forensics.
