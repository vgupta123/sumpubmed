BACKGROUND
γ-lactamase is used for the resolution of γ-lactam which is utilized in the synthesizing of abacavir and peramivir. in some cases, enzymatic method is the most utilized method because of its high efficiency and productivity. the cellulose binding domain  of cellulose is often used as the bio-specific affinity matrix for enzyme immobilization. cellulose is cheap and it has excellent chemical and physical properties. meanwhile, binding between cellulose and cbd is tight and the desorption rarely happened.


RESULTS
we prepared two fusion constructs of the γ-lactamase gene gla, which was from sulfolobus solfataricus p <dig>  these two constructs had cbd  fused at amino or carboxyl terminus of the γ-lactamase. these two constructs were heterogeneously expressed in e. coli rosetta  as two fusion proteins. both of them were immobilized well on avicel . the apparent kinetic parameters revealed that carboxyl terminus fused protein  was a better catalyst. the vmax and kcat value of avicel immobilized gla-linker-cbd were  <dig> u mg- <dig> and  <dig>  × 105 s- <dig> respectively. and the values of the free gla-linker-cbd were  <dig> u mg- <dig> and  <dig>  × 105 s- <dig> respectively. these data indicated that the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme was upgraded after immobilization. the immobilized gla-linker-cbd had a 10-degree temperature optimum dropping from 80°c to 70°c but it was stable when incubated at 60°c for 48 h. it remained stable in catalyzing 20-batch reactions. after optimization, the immobilized enzyme concentration in transformation was set as 200 mg/ml. we found out that there was inhibition that occurred to the immobilized enzyme when substrate concentration exceeded 60 mm. finally a 10 ml-volume transformation was conducted, in which  <dig>  m substrate was hydrolyzed and the resolution was completed within 9 h with a  <dig> % ee value.


CONCLUSIONS
cellulose is the most abundant and renewable material on the earth. the absorption between cbd domain and cellulose is a bio-green process. the cellulose immobilized fusion gla exhibited good catalytic characters, therefore we think the cellulose immobilized gla is a promising catalyst for the industrial preparation of  - γ-lactam.
