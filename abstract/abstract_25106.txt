BACKGROUND
analysis of dna copy number alterations and gene expression changes in human samples have been used to find potential target genes in complex diseases. recent studies have combined these two types of data using different strategies, but focusing on finding gene-based relationships. however, it has been proposed that these data can be used to identify key genomic regions, which may enclose causal genes under the assumption that disease-associated gene expression changes are caused by genomic alterations.


RESULTS
following this proposal, we undertake a new integrative analysis of genome-wide expression and copy number datasets. the analysis is based on the combined location of both types of signals along the genome. our approach takes into account the genomic location in the copy number  analysis and also in the gene expression  analysis. to achieve this we apply a segmentation algorithm to both types of data using paired samples. then, we perform a correlation analysis and a frequency analysis of the gene loci in the segmented cn regions and the segmented ge regions; selecting in both cases the statistically significant loci. in this way, we find cn alterations that show strong correspondence with ge changes. we applied our method to a human dataset of  <dig> glioblastoma multiforme samples finding key loci and hotspots that correspond to major alterations previously described for this type of tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
identification of key altered genomic loci constitutes a first step to find the genes that drive the alteration in a malignant state. these driver genes can be found in regions that show high correlation in copy number alterations and expression changes.
