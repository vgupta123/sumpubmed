BACKGROUND
alkaline/neutral invertase , an enzyme that hydrolyzes sucrose irreversibly into glucose and fructose, is essential for normal plant growth,development, and stress tolerance. however, the physiological and/or molecular mechanism underpinning the role of a/n-inv in abiotic stress tolerance is poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this report, an a/n-inv gene  was isolated from poncirus trifoliata, a cold-hardy relative of citrus, and functionally characterized. ptra/ninv expression levels were induced by cold, salt, dehydration, sucrose, and aba, but decreased by glucose. ptra/ninv was found to localize in both chloroplasts and mitochondria. overexpression of ptra/ninv conferred enhanced tolerance to multiple stresses, including cold, high salinity, and drought, as supported by lower levels of reactive oxygen species , reduced oxidative damages, decreased water loss rate, and increased photosynthesis efficiency, relative to wild-type . the transgenic plants exhibited higher a/n-inv activity and greater reducing sugar content under normal and stress conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
ptra/ninv is an important gene implicated in sucrose decomposition, and plays a positive role in abiotic stress tolerance by promoting osmotic adjustment, ros detoxification and photosynthesis efficiency. thus, ptra/ninv has great potential to be used in transgenic breeding for improvement of stress tolerance.
