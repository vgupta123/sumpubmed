BACKGROUND
worldwide, hepatitis e virus  genotype  <dig> is observed in pigs and transmission to humans is implied. to be able to estimate public health risks from e.g. contact with pigs or consumption of pork products, the transmission routes and dynamics of infection should be identified. hence, the course of hev-infection in naturally infected pigs should be studied.


RESULTS
to resemble natural transmission,  <dig> hev-susceptible pigs were infected either by one-to-one exposure to intravenously inoculated pigs , by one-to-one exposure to contact-infected pigs  or due to an unknown non-intravenous infection route . the course of hev-infection for contact-infected pigs was characterized by: faecal hev rna excretion that started at day  <dig>  postexposure and lasted  <dig>  days; viremia that started after  <dig>  days of faecal hev rna excretion and lasted  <dig>  days; antibody development that was detected after  <dig>  days of faecal hev rna excretion. the time until onset of faecal hev rna excretion and onset of viremia was significantly shorter for iv-pigs compared to contact-infected pigs, whereas the duration of faecal hev rna excretion was significantly longer. at  <dig> days postinfection hev rna was detected less frequently in organs of contact-infected pigs compared to iv-pigs. for contact-infected pigs, hev rna was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> muscle samples that were proxies for pork at retail and in  <dig> of  <dig> urine samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the course of infection differed between infection routes, suggesting that contact-infection could be a better model for natural transmission than iv inoculation. urine and meat were identified as possible hev-sources for pig-to-pig and pig-to-human hev transmission.
