BACKGROUND
protein-dna interactions are involved in many biological processes essential for cellular function. to understand the molecular mechanism of protein-dna recognition, it is necessary to identify the dna-binding residues in dna-binding proteins. however, structural data are available for only a few hundreds of protein-dna complexes. with the rapid accumulation of sequence data, it becomes an important but challenging task to accurately predict dna-binding residues directly from amino acid sequence data.


RESULTS
a new machine learning approach has been developed in this study for predicting dna-binding residues from amino acid sequence data. the approach used both the labelled data instances collected from the available structures of protein-dna complexes and the abundant unlabeled data found in protein sequence databases. the evolutionary information contained in the unlabeled sequence data was represented as position-specific scoring matrices  and several new descriptors. the sequence-derived features were then used to train random forests , which could handle a large number of input variables and avoid model overfitting. the use of evolutionary information was found to significantly improve classifier performance. the rf classifier was further evaluated using a separate test dataset, and the predicted dna-binding residues were examined in the context of three-dimensional structures.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that the rf-based approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of dna-binding residues than previous studies. a new web server called bindn-rf  has thus been developed to make the rf classifier accessible to the biological research community.
