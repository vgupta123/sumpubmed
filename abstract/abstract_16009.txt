BACKGROUND
we investigated several adjuvants for their effects on the humoral immune response in both mice and cattle using the central domain of congopain , the major cysteine protease of trypanosoma congolense, as a model for developing a vaccine against animal trypanosomosis. the magnitude and sustainability of the immune response against c <dig> and the occurrence of a booster effect of infection, an indirect measure of the presence of memory cells, were determined by elisa, while spectrofluorometry was used to determine and measure the presence of enzyme-inhibiting antibodies.


RESULTS
mice immunized with recombinant c <dig> in titermax™, adjuphos™, purified saponin quil a™ or gerbu™ showed the best response according to the evaluation criteria and the latter three were chosen for the cattle vaccination study. the cattle were challenged with t. congolense four and a half months after the last booster. cattle immunized with recombinant c <dig> in purified saponin quil a™ showed the best antibody response according to the measured parameters.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified purified saponin quil a™ as a good adjuvant for immunizations with c <dig>  the results from this study will be useful in future attempts to develop an effective anti-disease vaccine against african trypanosomosis.
