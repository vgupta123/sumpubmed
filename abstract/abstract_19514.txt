BACKGROUND
the industrial chicory, cichorium intybus, is a member of the asteraceae family that accumulates fructan of the inulin type in its root. inulin is a low calories sweetener, a texture agent and a health promoting ingredient due to its prebiotic properties. average inulin chain length is a critical parameter that is genotype and temperature dependent. in the context of the study of carbohydrate metabolism and to get insight into the transcriptome of chicory root and to visualize temporal changes of gene expression during the growing season, we obtained and characterized  <dig> cdna libraries from chicory roots regularly sampled in field during a growing season. a leaf and a nodule libraries were also obtained for comparison.


RESULTS
approximately  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  were obtained from each of twelve cdna libraries resulting in a  <dig>  est dataset. clustering of these ests returned  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets for a total of  <dig>  putative unigenes. all ests were compared to public sequence databases and functionally classified. data were specifically searched for sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism. season wide evolution of functional classes was evaluated by comparing libraries at the level of functional categories and unigenes distribution.


CONCLUSIONS
this chicory est dataset provides a season wide outlook of the genes expressed in the root and to a minor extent in leaves and nodules. the dataset contains more than  <dig> sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism and  <dig>  new ests when compared to other recently released chicory est datasets, probably because of the season wide coverage of the root samples. we believe that these sequences will contribute to accelerate research and breeding of the industrial chicory as well as of closely related species.
