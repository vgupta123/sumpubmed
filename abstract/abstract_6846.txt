BACKGROUND
we previously identified a set of genes called ecats  that are expressed at high levels in mouse es cells. here, we examine the expression and dna methylation of ecats in somatic cells and germ cells.


RESULTS
in all ecats examined, the promoter region had low methylation levels in es cells, but higher levels in somatic cells. in contrast, in spite of their lack of pluripotency, male germline stem  cells expressed most ecats and exhibited hypomethylation of ecat promoter regions. we observed a similar hypomethylation of ecat loci in adult testis and isolated sperm. some ecats were even less methylated in male germ cells than in es cells. however, a few ecats were not expressed in gs cells, and most of them targets of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  the octamer/sox regulatory elements were hypermethylated in these genes. in addition, we found that gs cells express little sox <dig> protein and low oct3/ <dig> protein despite abundant expression of their transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that dna hypermethylation and transcriptional repression of a small set of ecats, together with post-transcriptional repression of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  contribute to the loss of pluripotency in male germ cells.
