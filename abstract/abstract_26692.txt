BACKGROUND
culture-independent methods based on the 16s ribosomal rna molecule are nowadays widely used for assessment of the composition of the intestinal microbiota, in relation to host health or probiotic efficacy. because bifidobacterium thermophilum was only recently isolated from human faeces until now, no specific real-time pcr  assay has been developed for detection of this species as component of the bifidobacterial community of the human intestinal flora.


RESULTS
design of specific primers and probe was achieved based on comparison of  <dig> published bifidobacterial 16s rdna sequences with the recently published sequence of the human faecal isolate b. thermophilum rbl <dig>  specificity of the primer was tested in silico by similarity search against the sequence database and confirmed experimentally by pcr amplification on  <dig> bifidobacterium strains, representing  <dig> different species, and two lactobacillus strains. the qpcr assay developed was linear for b. thermophilum rbl <dig> dna quantities ranging from  <dig>  ng/μl to  <dig> ng/μl and showed a detection limit of  <dig> cells per gram faeces. the application of this new qpcr assay allowed to detect the presence of b. thermophilum in one sample from a 6-month old breast-fed baby among  <dig> human faecal samples tested. additionally, the specific qpcr primers in combination with selective plating experiments led to the isolation of f9k <dig>  a faecal isolate from a 4-month old breast-fed baby. the 16s rdna sequence of this isolate is  <dig> % similar to that of b. thermophilum rbl <dig> and confirmed the applicability of the new qpcr assay in faecal samples.


CONCLUSIONS
a new b. thermophilum-specific qpcr assay was developed based on species-specific target nucleotides in the 16s rdna. it can be used to further characterize the composition of the bifidobacterial community in the human gastrointestinal tract. until recently, b. thermophilum was considered as a species of animal origin, but here we confirm with the application of this new pcr assay the presence of b. thermophilum strains in the human gut.
