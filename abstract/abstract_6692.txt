BACKGROUND
previous studies have indicated that enhancement of autophagy lysosome pathway may be beneficial for parkinson’s disease , in which aberrant accumulation of aggregated/misfolded proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction are considered as crucial pathogenesis. recently, a number of studies have suggested the neuroprotective effects of lithium in models of several neurodegenerative diseases including pd. however, the exact mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection remain unclear. in our study, rotenone-exposed sh-sy5y cells were used as an in vitro parkinsonian model to assess the autophagy-enhancing effect of lithium and the underlying mechanisms were further investigated.


RESULTS
similar to the common used autophagy enhancer rapamycin , lithium  significantly recovered the shrinkage of sh-sy5y cells, and alleviated rotenone-induced cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction and reactive oxygen species accumulation. furthermore, the protective effects induced by licl were partially blocked by the co-treatment of autophagy inhibitors such as 3-methyladenine  or chloroquine . moreover, 3-ma or chl suppressed licl-induced autophagy in the immunoblot assay. in addition, the co-localization of lc <dig> and mitochondria and the preservation of mitochondrial function within licl-treated cells were observed, confirming that the damaged mitochondria were cleared through autophagy .


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggested that lithium exerted neuroprotection against rotenone-induced injuries partially through the autophagy pathway. pharmacologically induction of autophagy by lithium may represent a novel therapeutic strategy as a disease-modifier in pd.
