BACKGROUND
genome-wide expression patterns in physiological cardiac hypertrophy. co-expression patterns in physiological cardiac hypertrophy


RESULTS
in this study, the first large-scale analysis of publicly available genome-wide expression data of several in vivo murine models of physiological lvh was carried out using network analysis. on evaluating  <dig> million gene co-expression patterns across  <dig> relevant microarray experiments, it was found that physiological adaptation is an evolutionarily conserved processes involving preservation of the function of cytochrome c oxidase, induction of autophagy compatible with cell survival, and coordinated regulation of angiogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis not only identifies known biological pathways involved in physiological lvh, but also offers novel insights into the molecular basis of this phenotype by identifying key networks of co-expressed genes, as well as their topological and functional properties, using relevant high-quality microarray experiments and network inference.
