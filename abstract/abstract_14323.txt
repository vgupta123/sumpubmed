BACKGROUND
the molecular mechanisms that determine the organism's response to a variety of doses and modalities of stress factors are not well understood.


RESULTS
we studied effects of ionizing radiation , entomopathogenic fungus , starvation , and cold shock  on an organism's viability indicators  and transcriptome changes in the drosophila melanogaster model. all stress factors but cold shock resulted in a decrease of lifespan proportional to the dose of treatment. however, stress-factors affected locomotor activity without correlation with lifespan. our data revealed both significant similarities and differences in differential gene expression and the activity of biological processes under the influence of stress factors.


CONCLUSIONS
studied doses of stress treatments deleteriously affect the organism's viability and lead to different changes of both general and specific cellular stress response mechanisms.
