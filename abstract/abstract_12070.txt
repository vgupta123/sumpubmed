BACKGROUND
it has been suggested that the ectopic expression of pdx <dig>  a dominant pancreatic transcription factor, plays a critical role in the developmental programming of the pancreas even from cells of unrelated tissues such as keratinocytes and amniotic fluid stem cells. in this study we have chosen to drive pancreatic development in human amnion epithelial cells by inducing endogenous pdx <dig> expression. further, we have investigated the role of epidermal growth factor  and poly-l-ornithine  on this differentiation process.


RESULTS
human amnion epithelial cells expressed high levels of endogenous pdx <dig> upon transduction with an adenoviral vector expressing murine pdx <dig>  other markers of various stages of pancreatic differentiation such as nkx <dig> , sox <dig>  rfx <dig>  foxa <dig>  cftr, neurod <dig>  pax <dig> and ppy were also expressed upon pdx <dig> transduction.

although initial expression of pancreatic progenitor markers was higher in culture conditions lacking egf, for a sustained and increased expression egf was required. culture on plo further increased the positive impact of egf.


CONCLUSIONS
pancreatic marker expression subsequent to mpdx <dig> transduction suggests that this approach may facilitate the in vitro differentiation of haecs into cells of the endocrine pancreas. this result may have important implications in diabetes therapy.
