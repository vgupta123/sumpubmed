BACKGROUND
a number of epidemiological studies have established a link between insulin resistance and the prevalence of depression. the occurrence of depression was found to precede the onset of diabetes and was hypothesized to be associated with inherited inter-related insufficiency of the peripheral and central insulin receptors. recently, dicholine succinate, a sensitizer of the neuronal insulin receptor, was shown to stimulate insulin-dependent h2o <dig> production of the mitochondrial respiratory chain leading to an enhancement of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons. as such, this mechanism can be a novel target for the elevation of insulin signaling.


RESULTS
administration of ds  in cd <dig> mice for  <dig> days prior to the onset of stress procedure, diminished manifestations of anhedonia defined in a sucrose test and behavioral despair in the forced swim test. treatment with dicholine succinate reduced the anxiety scores of stressed mice in the dark/light box paradigm, precluded stress-induced decreases of long-term contextual memory in the step-down avoidance test and hippocampal gene expression of igf <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that dicholine succinate has an antidepressant-like effect, which might be mediated via the up-regulation of hippocampal expression of igf <dig>  and implicate the neuronal insulin receptor in the pathogenesis of stress-induced depressive syndrome.
