BACKGROUND
scant genomic information from non-avian reptile sex chromosomes is available, and for only a few lizards, several snakes and one turtle species, and it represents only a small fraction of the total sex chromosome sequences in these species.


RESULTS
we report a 352Â kb of contiguous sequence from the sex chromosome of a squamate reptile, pogona vitticeps, with a zz/zw sex microchromosome system. this contig contains five protein coding genes , and major families of repetitive sequences with a high number of copies of ltr and non-ltr retrotransposons, including the cr <dig> and bov-b lines. the two genes, oprd <dig> and rcc <dig> are part of a homologous syntenic block, which is conserved among amniotes. while oprd <dig> and rcc <dig> have no known function in sex determination or differentiation in amniotes, this homologous syntenic block in mammals and chicken also contains r-spondin  <dig> , the ovarian differentiating gene in mammals. in order to explore the probability that rspo <dig> is sex determining in dragon lizards, genomic bac and cdna clones were mapped using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. their location on an autosomal microchromosome pair, not on the zw sex microchromosomes, eliminates rspo <dig> as a candidate sex determining gene in p. vitticeps.


CONCLUSIONS
our study has characterized the largest contiguous stretch of physically mapped sex chromosome sequence  from a zz/zw lizard species. although this region represents only a small fraction of the sex chromosomes of p. vitticeps, it has revealed several features typically associated with sex chromosomes including the accumulation of large blocks of repetitive sequences.
