BACKGROUND
a small group of f-box proteins consisting of a conserved f-box domain linked to a domain homologous to the glycan-binding protein has been identified within the genome of arabidopsis thaliana. previously, the so-called f-box-nictaba protein, encoded by the gene at2g <dig>  was shown to be a functional lectin which binds n-acetyllactosamine structures. here, we present a detailed qrt-pcr expression analysis of f-box-nictaba in arabidopsis plants upon different stresses and hormone treatments.


RESULTS
expression of the f-box-nictaba gene was enhanced after plant treatment with salicylic acid and after plant infection with the virulent pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig> . β-glucuronidase histochemical staining of transgenic arabidopsis plants displayed preferential activity of the at2g <dig> promoter in trichomes present on young rosette leaves. qrt-pcr analyses confirmed high expression of f-box-nictaba in leaf trichomes. a. thaliana plants overexpressing the gene showed less disease symptoms after pst dc <dig> infection with reduced bacterial colonization compared to infected wild type and f-box-nictaba knock-out plants.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the arabidopsis f-box-nictaba gene is a stress-inducible gene responsive to sa, bacterial infection and heat stress, and is involved in salicylic acid related plant defense responses. this knowledge enriched our understanding of the physiological importance of f-box-nictaba, and can be used to create plants with better performance in changing environmental conditions.
