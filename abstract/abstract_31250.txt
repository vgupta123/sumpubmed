BACKGROUND
the caenorhabditis elegans genome is known to code for at least  <dig> g protein-coupled receptors , but the gpcr critical to the regulation of reproduction in this nematode are not yet known. this study examined whether gpcrs orthologous to human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor  exist in c. elegans.


RESULTS
our sequence analyses indicated the presence of two proteins in c. elegans, one of  <dig> amino acids  and another of  <dig> amino acids  with  <dig> % and  <dig> % nucleotide similarity to human gnrhr <dig> and gnrhr <dig>  respectively. like human gnrhr <dig>  structural analysis of the c. elegans gnrhr <dig> orthologue  predicted a rhodopsin family member with  <dig> transmembrane domains, g protein coupling sites and phosphorylation sites for protein kinase c. of the functionally important amino acids in human gnrhr <dig>  56% were conserved in the c. elegans orthologue. ce-gnrhr was actively transcribed in adult worms and immunoanalyses using antibodies generated against both human and c. elegans gnrhr indicated the presence of a 46-kda protein, the calculated molecular mass of the immature ce-gnrhr. ce-gnrhr staining was specifically localized to the germline, intestine and pharynx. in the germline and intestine, ce-gnrhr was localized specifically to nuclei as revealed by colocalization with a dna nuclear stain. however in the pharynx, ce-gnrhr was localized to the myofilament lattice of the pharyngeal musculature, suggesting a functional role for ce-gnrhr signaling in the coupling of food intake with reproduction. phylogenetic analyses support an early evolutionary origin of gnrh-like receptors, as evidenced by the hypothesized grouping of ce-gnrhr, vertebrate gnrhrs, a molluscan gnrhr, and the adipokinetic hormone receptors  and corazonin receptors of arthropods.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of a gnrhr orthologue in c. elegans, which shares significant similarity with insect akhrs. in vertebrates, gnrhrs are central components of the reproductive endocrine system, and the identification of a gnrhr orthologue in c. elegans suggests the potential use of c. elegans as a model system to study reproductive endocrinology.
