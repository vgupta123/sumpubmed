BACKGROUND
leukotriene b <dig>  is a potent inflammatory mediator that also stimulates the immune response. in addition, it promotes polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis, chemotaxis, chemokinesis and modulates cytokines release. regarding chemical instability of the leukotriene molecule, in the present study we assessed the immunomodulatory activities conferred by ltb <dig> released from microspheres . a previous oil-in-water emulsion solvent extraction-evaporation method was chosen to prepare ltb4-loaded ms.


RESULTS
in the mice cremasteric microcirculation, intraescrotal injection of  <dig>  ml of ltb4-loaded ms provoked significant increases in leukocyte rolling flux, adhesion and emigration besides significant decreases in the leukocyte rolling velocity. ltb4-loaded ms also increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î±  expression by murine peritoneal macrophages and stimulate them to generate nitrite levels. monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig>  and nitric oxide  productions were also increased when human umbilical vein and artery endothelial cells  were stimulated with ltb4-loaded ms.


CONCLUSIONS
ltb4-loaded ms preserve the biological activity of the encapsulated mediator indicating their use as a new strategy to modulate cell activation, especially in the innate immune response.
