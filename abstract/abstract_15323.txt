BACKGROUND
melioidosis, a lethal tropical infection that is endemic in southeast asia and northern australia, is caused by the saprophytic gram-negative bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei. overall mortality approaches 40% yet little is known about mechanisms of host defense. toll-like receptors  are host transmembrane receptors that recognize conserved pathogen molecular patterns and induce an inflammatory response. the lipopolysaccharide  of gram-negative bacteria is a potent inducer of the host innate immune system. tlr <dig>  in association with md- <dig>  is the archetype receptor for lps although b. pseudomallei lps has been previously identified as a tlr <dig> agonist. we examined tlr signaling induced by b. pseudomallei, b. pseudomallei lps, and b. pseudomallei lipid a using gain-of-function transfection assays of nf-κb activation and studies of tlr-deficient macrophages.


RESULTS
in hek <dig> cells transfected with murine or human tlrs, cd <dig>  and md- <dig>  heat-killed b. pseudomallei activated tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  b. pseudomallei lps and lipid a activated tlr <dig> and this tlr4-mediated signaling required md- <dig>  in tlr2-/- macrophages, stimulation with heat-killed b. pseudomallei augmented tnf-α and mip- <dig> production whereas in tlr4-/- cells, tnf-α, mip- <dig>  and il- <dig> production was reduced. cytokine production by macrophages stimulated with b. pseudomallei lps or lipid a was entirely dependent on tlr <dig> but was increased in the absence of tlr <dig>  tlr adaptor molecule myd <dig> strongly regulated tnf-α production in response to heat-killed b. pseudomallei.


CONCLUSIONS
b. pseudomallei activates tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  in the presence of md- <dig>  b. pseudomallei lps and lipid a are tlr <dig> ligands. although the macrophage cytokine response to b. pseudomallei lps or lipid a is completely dependent on tlr <dig>  in tlr2-/- macrophages stimulated with b. pseudomallei, b. pseudomallei lps or lipid a, cytokine production is augmented. other myd88-dependent signaling pathways may also be important in the host response to b. pseudomallei infection. these findings provide new insights into critical mechanisms of host defense in melioidosis.
