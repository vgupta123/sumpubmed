BACKGROUND
erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is the causative agent of animal erysipelas and, to a fewer occurrences, human erysipeloid. it is ubiquitous in nature and commensal in diverse species of animals, wild or domestic, from mammals and birds to reptiles and fish. mechanisms of its virulence and pathogenicity are poorly understood.


RESULTS
making use of the complete genome sequencing of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> and comparative genome analysis between the three highly pathogenic strains , the genomic structure and putative functional elements, such as pathogenicity island -like regions, potential virulence factors and horizontal transferring genes of the bacteria are identified. strain sy <dig> genome is  <dig> , <dig> base pairs long, just  <dig> kilobases smaller than strain fujisawa, with the same gc level of  <dig> %. it contains  <dig>  open reading frames  predicted by glimmer  <dig> , of which  <dig>  were annotated by pgaap,  <dig>   were annotated by ncbi nr blast,  <dig>  by cog database and  <dig>  by kegg database.  <dig> potential virulence factors were annotated in strain sy <dig> by vfdb, while  <dig>  of them are common in the  <dig> strains,  <dig> of which are potentially related to antibiotic resistance and highly conserved ) amongst the three strains of e. rhusiopathiae and modestly homologous to other gastrointestinal tract-inhabiting firmicutes , e.g. clostridium spp., enterococcus spp. genomic island- and pathogenicity island-like regions were also predicted, in which some showed association with trna and potential virulence factors.


CONCLUSIONS
complete genome sequencing of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, the causative agent of animal erysipelas, was performed. molecular identification of various genomic elements pave the way to the better understanding of mechanisms underlying metabolic capabilities, pathogenicity of swine erysipelas and prospective vaccine targets besides the widely used spaa antigens.
