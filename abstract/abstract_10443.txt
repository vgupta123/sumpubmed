BACKGROUND
micrornas , a class of small non-coding endogenous rnas that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, play multiple key roles in plant growth and development and in biotic and abiotic stress response. knowledge and roles of mirnas in pomegranate fruit development have not been explored.


RESULTS
pomegranate, which accumulates a large amount of anthocyanins in skin and arils, is valuable to human health, mainly because of its antioxidant properties. in this study, we developed a small rna library from pooled rna samples from young seedlings to mature fruits and identified both conserved and pomegranate-specific mirna from  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads. for the pool of 15- to 30-nt small rnas, ~50 % were 24 nt. the mir <dig> family was the most abundant, followed by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  with variants within each family. the base bias at the first position from the 5’ end had a strong preference for u for most 18- to 26-nt srnas but a preference for a for 18-nt srnas. in addition, for all 24-nt srnas, the nucleotide u was preferred  in the first position. stem-loop rt-qpcr was used to validate the expression of the predominant mirnas and novel mirnas in leaves, male and female flowers, and multiple fruit developmental stages; mir <dig>  mir156a, mir159a, mir159b, and mir319b were upregulated during the later stages of fruit development. higher expression of mir <dig> in later fruit developmental may positively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis by reducing spl transcription factor. novel mirnas showed variation in expression among different tissues. these novel mirnas targeted different transcription factors and hormone related regulators. gene ontology and kegg pathway analyses revealed predominant metabolic processes and catalytic activities, important for fruit development. in addition, kegg pathway analyses revealed the involvement of mirnas in ascorbate and linolenic acid, starch and sucrose metabolism; rna transport; plant hormone signaling pathways; and circadian clock.


CONCLUSIONS
our first and preliminary report of mirnas will provide information on the synthesis of biochemical compounds of pomegranate for future research. the functions of the targets of the novel mirnas need further investigation.
