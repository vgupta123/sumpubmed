BACKGROUND
the human foxi <dig> gene codes for a transcription factor involved in the physiology of the inner ear, testis, and kidney. using three interspecies comparisons, it has been suggested that this may be a gene under human-specific selection. we sought to confirm this finding by using an extended set of orthologous sequences. additionally, we explored for signals of natural selection within humans by sequencing the gene in  <dig> europeans,  <dig> east asians and  <dig> yorubas and by analysing snp variation in a  <dig> mb region centered on foxi <dig> in  <dig> worldwide human populations from the hgdp-ceph diversity panel.


RESULTS
the genome sequences recently available from other primate and non-primate species showed that foxi <dig> divergence patterns are compatible with neutral evolution. sequence-based neutrality tests were not significant in europeans, east asians or yorubas. however, the long range haplotype  test, as well as the ihs and xp-rsb statistics revealed significantly extended tracks of homozygosity around foxi <dig> in africa, suggesting a recent episode of positive selection acting on this gene. a functionally relevant snp, as well as several snps either on the putatively selected core haplotypes or with significant ihs or xp-rsb values, displayed allele frequencies strongly correlated with the absolute geographical latitude of the populations sampled.


CONCLUSIONS
we present evidence for recent positive selection in the foxi <dig> gene region in africa. climate might be related to this recent adaptive event in humans. of the multiple functions of foxi <dig>  its role in kidney-mediated water-electrolyte homeostasis is the most obvious candidate for explaining a climate-related adaptation.
