BACKGROUND
one of the strategies for protein function annotation is to search particular structural motifs that are known to be shared by proteins with a given function.


RESULTS
here, we present a systematic extraction of structural motifs of seven residues from protein loops and we explore their correspondence with functional sites. our approach is based on the structural alphabet hmm-sa , which allows simplification of protein structures into uni-dimensional sequences, and advanced pattern statistics adapted to short sequences. structural motifs of interest are selected by looking for structural motifs significantly over-represented in scop superfamilies in protein loops. we discovered two types of structural motifs significantly over-represented in scop superfamilies:  ubiquitous motifs, shared by several superfamilies and  superfamily-specific motifs, over-represented in few superfamilies. a comparison of ubiquitous words with known small structural motifs shows that they contain well-described motifs as turn, niche or nest motifs. a comparison between superfamily-specific motifs and biological annotations of swiss-prot reveals that some of them actually correspond to functional sites involved in the binding sites of small ligands, such as atp/gtp, nad and sah/sam.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that statistical over-representation in scop superfamilies is linked to functional features. the detection of over-represented motifs within structures simplified by hmm-sa is therefore a promising approach for prediction of functional sites and annotation of uncharacterized proteins.
