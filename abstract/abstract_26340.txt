BACKGROUND
soybean  production is significantly hampered by frequent droughts in many regions of the world including the united states. identifying microrna -controlled posttranscriptional gene regulation under drought will enhance our understanding of molecular basis of drought tolerance in this important cash crop. indeed, mirna profiles in soybean exposed to drought were studied but not from the primary root tips, which is not only a main zone of water uptake but also critical for water stress sensing and signaling.

methods
here we report mirna profiles specifically from well-watered and water-stressed primary root tips  of soybean. small rna sequencing confirmed the expression of vastly diverse mirna  population, and, importantly several conserved mirnas were abundantly expressed in primary root tips.


RESULTS
notably,  <dig> highly conserved mirna families were differentially regulated in response to water-deficit; six were upregulated while six others were downregulated at least by one fold  change. differentially regulated soybean mirnas are targeting genes include auxin response factors, cu/zn superoxide dismutases, laccases and plantacyanin and several others.


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlighted the importance of mirnas in primary root tips both under control and water-deficit conditions; under control conditions, mirnas could be important for cell division, cell elongation and maintenance of the root apical meristem activity including quiescent centre whereas under water stress differentially regulated mirnas could decrease auxin signaling and oxidative stress as well as other metabolic processes that save energy and water.
