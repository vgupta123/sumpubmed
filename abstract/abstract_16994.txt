BACKGROUND
the reduced cost and improved efficiency of whole genome sequencing  is drastically improving the development of cats as biomedical models. persian cats are models for leber’s congenital amaurosis , the most severe and earliest onset form of visual impairment in humans. cats with innocuous breed-defining traits, such as a bobbed tail, can also be models for somite segmentation and vertebral column development.

methods
the first wgs in cats was conducted on a trio segregating for lca and the bobbed tail abnormality. variants were identified using freebayes and effects predicted using snpeff. variants within a known haplotype block for cat lca and specific candidate genes for both phenotypes were prioritized by the predicted variant effect on the proteins and concordant segregation within the trio. the efficiency of wgs of a single trio of domestic cats was evaluated.


RESULTS
a stop gain was identified at position c.577c > t in cat aipl <dig>  a predicted p.arg193*. a c.5a > g variant causing a p.v2a was identified in hes <dig>  the variants segregated concordantly in a persian – japanese bobtail pedigree. over  <dig> cats from  <dig> different breeds and populations were genotyped for the aipl <dig> variant, defining an allelic frequency in only persian –related breeds of  <dig>  %. a sub-set of cats was genotyped for the hes <dig> variant, supporting the variant as private to the japanese bobtail breed. approximately  <dig> million snps were identified for application in cat research. the cat aipl <dig> variant would have been considered a high priority variant for evaluation, regardless of a priori knowledge from previous genetic studies.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first effort of the  <dig> lives cat genome sequencing initiative to identify disease - causing variants in the domestic cat using wgs. the current cat reference assembly is efficient for gene and variant identification. however, as the feline variant database improves, development of cats as biomedical models for human disease will be more efficient, providing an alternative, large animal model for drug and gene therapy trials. undiagnosed human patients with early-onset blindness should be screened for this aipl <dig> variant. the hes <dig> variant should further calibrate the somite segmentation clock.
