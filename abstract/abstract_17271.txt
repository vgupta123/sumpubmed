BACKGROUND
members of the genus nocardia are ubiquitous environmental saprophytes capable to cause human pulmonary, disseminated and cutaneous nocardiosis or bovine mastitis. innate immunity appears to play an important role in early defense against nocardia species. to elucidate the contribution of antimicrobial peptides  in innate defense against nocardia, the activity of human α-defensins human neutrophil peptides  1- <dig>  human β-defensin - <dig> and cathelicidin ll- <dig> as well as bovine β-defensins lingual and tracheal antimicrobial peptides  and bovine neutrophil-derived indolicidin against four important nocardia species was investigated.


RESULTS
whereas n. farcinica atcc  <dig> and n. nova atcc  <dig> were found to be susceptible to all investigated human and bovine amps, n. asteroides atcc  <dig> was killed exclusively by neutrophil-derived human α-defensins hnp 1- <dig> and bovine indolicidin. n. brasiliensis atcc  <dig> was found to exhibit complete resistance to investigated human amps and to be susceptible only to bovine indolicidin.


CONCLUSIONS
selected amps are capable to contribute to the first line of defense against nocardia, yet, susceptibility appears to vary across different nocardia species. obtained results of neutrophil-derived amps to possess the broadest antinocardial spectrum are remarkable, since nocardiosis is characterized by a neutrophil-rich infiltrate in vivo.
