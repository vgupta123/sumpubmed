BACKGROUND
serotonin induces fluid secretion from calliphora salivary glands by the parallel activation of the insp3/ca2+ and camp signaling pathways. we investigated whether camp affects 5-ht-induced ca2+ signaling and insp3-induced ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum .


RESULTS
increasing intracellular camp level by bath application of forskolin, ibmx or camp in the continuous presence of threshold 5-ht concentrations converted oscillatory i changes into a sustained increase. intraluminal ca2+ measurements in the er of Î²-escin-permeabilized glands with mag-fura- <dig> revealed that camp augmented insp3-induced ca2+ release in a concentration-dependent manner. this indicated that camp sensitized the insp <dig> receptor ca2+ channel for insp <dig>  by using camp analogs that activated either protein kinase a  or epac and the application of pka-inhibitors, we found that camp-induced augmentation of insp3-induced ca2+ release was mediated by pka not by epac. recordings of the transepithelial potential of the glands suggested that camp sensitized the insp3/ca2+ signaling pathway for 5-ht, because ibmx potentiated ca2+-dependent cl- transport activated by a threshold 5-ht concentration.


CONCLUSIONS
this report shows, for the first time for an insect system, that camp can potentiate insp3-induced ca2+ release from the er in a pka-dependent manner, and that this crosstalk between camp and insp3/ca2+ signaling pathways enhances transepithelial electrolyte transport.
