BACKGROUND
soil salinity adversely affects plant growth and development and disturbs intracellular ion homeostasis resulting cellular toxicity. the salt overly sensitive  <dig>  gene encodes a plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter that plays an important role in imparting salt stress tolerance to plants. here, we report the cloning and characterisation of the sbsos <dig> gene from salicornia brachiata, an extreme halophyte.


RESULTS
the sbsos <dig> gene is  <dig> bp long and encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids. sbsos <dig> exhibited a greater level of constitutive expression in roots than in shoots and was further increased by salt stress. overexpressing the s. brachiata sbsos <dig> gene in tobacco conferred high salt tolerance, promoted seed germination and increased root length, shoot length, leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, relative water content , chlorophyll, k+/na+ ratio, membrane stability index, soluble sugar, proline and amino acid content relative to wild type  plants. transgenic plants exhibited reductions in electrolyte leakage, reactive oxygen species  and mda content in response to salt stress, which probably occurred because of reduced cytosolic na+ content and oxidative damage. at higher salt stress, transgenic tobacco plants exhibited reduced na+ content in root and leaf and higher concentrations in stem and xylem sap relative to wt, which suggests a role of sbsos <dig> in na+ loading to xylem from root and leaf tissues. transgenic lines also showed increased k+ and ca2+ content in root tissue compared to wt, which reflect that sbsos <dig> indirectly affects the other transporters activity.


CONCLUSIONS
overexpression of sbsos <dig> in tobacco conferred a high degree of salt tolerance, enhanced plant growth and altered physiological and biochemical parameters in response to salt stress. in addition to na+ efflux outside the plasma membrane, sbsos <dig> also helps to maintain variable na+ content in different organs and also affect the other transporters activity indirectly. these results broaden the role of sbsos <dig> in planta and suggest that this gene could be used to develop salt-tolerant transgenic crops.
