BACKGROUND
image registration is an important research topic in the field of image processing. applying image registration to vascular image allows multiple images to be strengthened and fused, which has practical value in disease detection, clinical assisted therapy, etc. however, it is hard to register vascular structures with high noise and large difference in an efficient and effective method.


RESULTS
different from common image registration methods based on area or features, which were sensitive to distortion and uncertainty in vascular structure, we proposed a novel registration method based on network structure and circuit simulation. vessel images were transformed to graph networks and segmented to branches to reduce the calculation complexity. weighted graph networks were then converted to circuits, in which node voltages of the circuit reflecting the vessel structures were used for node registration. the experiments in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulation and clinical image sets showed the success of our proposed method in registration.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed vascular image registration method based on network structure and circuit simulation is stable, fault tolerant and efficient, which is a useful complement to the current mainstream image registration methods.
