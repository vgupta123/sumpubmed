BACKGROUND
plants trigger and tailor defense responses after perception of the oral secretions  of attacking specialist lepidopteran larvae. fatty acid-amino acid conjugates  in the os of the manduca sexta larvae are necessary and sufficient to elicit the herbivory-specific responses in nicotiana attenuata, an annual wild tobacco species. how facs are perceived and activate signal transduction mechanisms is unknown.


RESULTS
we used supersage combined with  <dig> sequencing to quantify the early transcriptional changes elicited by the fac n-linolenoyl-glutamic acid  and virus induced gene silencing  to examine the function of candidate genes in the m. sexta-n. attenuata interaction. the analysis targeted mrnas encoding regulatory components: rare transcripts with very rapid fac-elicited kinetics . from  <dig>  unique tag sequences identified ,  <dig> and  <dig> were significantly up- and down-regulated â‰¥  <dig> -fold, respectively, after 18:3-glu elicitation compared to wounding. based on gene ontology classification, more than 25% of the annotated unitags corresponded to putative regulatory components, including  <dig> transcriptional regulators and  <dig> protein kinases. quantitative pcr analysis was used to analyze the fac-dependent regulation of a subset of  <dig> of these unitags and for most of them a rapid and transient induction was confirmed. six fac-regulated genes were functionally characterized by vigs and two, a putative lipid phosphate phosphatase  and a protein of unknown function, were identified as important mediators of the m. sexta-n. attenuata interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the early changes in the transcriptome of n. attenuata after fac elicitation using supersage/ <dig> has identified regulatory genes involved in insect-specific mediated responses in plants. moreover, it has provided a foundation for the identification of additional novel regulators associated with this process.
