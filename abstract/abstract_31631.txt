BACKGROUND
protein kinase c interacting protein  is a small protein belonging to the histidine triad  family proteins. its brain immunoreactivity is located in neurons and neuronal processes. pkci/hint <dig> gene knockout  mice display hyper-locomotion in response to d-amphetamine which is considered a positive symptom of schizophrenia in animal models. postmortem studies identified pkci/hint <dig> as a candidate molecule for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. we investigated the hypothesis that the pkci/hint <dig> gene may play an important role in regulating mood function in the cns. we submitted pkci/hint <dig> ko mice and their wild type  littermates to behavioral tests used to study anti-depressant, anxiety like behaviors, and goal-oriented behavior. additionally, as many mood disorders coincide with modifications of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis function, we assessed the hpa activity through measurement of plasma corticosterone levels.


RESULTS
compared to the wt controls, ko mice exhibited less immobility in the forced swim  and the tail suspension  tests. activity in the tst tended to be attenuated by acute treatment with valproate at  <dig> mg/kg in ko mice. the pkci/hint <dig> ko mice presented less thigmotaxis in the morris water maze and spent progressively more time in the lit compartment in the light/dark test. in a place navigation task, ko mice exhibited enhanced acquisition and retention. furthermore, the afternoon basal plasma corticosterone level in pkci/hint <dig> ko mice was significantly higher than in the wt.


CONCLUSIONS
pkci/hint <dig> ko mice displayed a phenotype of behavioral and endocrine features which indicate changes of mood function, including anxiolytic-like and anti-depressant like behaviors, in conjunction with an elevated corticosterone level in plasma. these results suggest that the pkci/hint  <dig> gene could be important for the mood regulation function in the cns.
