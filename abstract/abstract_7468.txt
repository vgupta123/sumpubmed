BACKGROUND
paenibacillus larvae is a firmicute bacterium that causes american foulbrood, a lethal disease in honeybees and is a major source of global agricultural losses. although p. larvae phages were isolated prior to  <dig>  no full genome sequences of p. larvae bacteriophages were published or analyzed. this report includes an in-depth analysis of the structure, genomes, and relatedness of p. larvae myoviruses abouo, davis, emery, jimmer <dig>  jimmer <dig>  and siphovirus phiibb_pl <dig> to each other and to other known phages.


RESULTS
p. larvae phages abouo, davies, emery, jimmer <dig>  and jimmer <dig> are myoviruses with ~ <dig> kbp genomes. the six p. larvae phages form three distinct groups by dotplot analysis. an annotated linear genome map of these six phages displays important identifiable genes and demonstrates the relationship between phages. sixty phage assembly or structural protein genes and  <dig> regulatory or other non-structural protein genes were identifiable among the six p. larvae phages. jimmer <dig>  jimmer <dig>  and davies formed stable lysogens resistant to superinfection by genetically similar phages. the correlation between tape measure protein gene length and phage tail length allowed identification of co-isolated phages emery and abouo in electron micrographs. a phamerator database was assembled with the p. larvae phage genomes and  <dig> genomes of firmicute-infecting phages, including  <dig> bacillus phages. phamerator identified conserved domains in  <dig>  of  <dig>  phamilies  encoded by genes in the database and revealed that p. larvae phage genomes shared at least one phamily with  <dig> of the  <dig> other phages. the phamily relationship of large terminase proteins was used to indicate putative dna packaging strategies. analyses from coregenes, phamerator, and electron micrograph measurements indicated jimmer <dig>  jimmer <dig>  abouo and davies were related to phages phic <dig>  ej- <dig>  kc5a, and aq <dig>  which are small-genome myoviruses that infect streptococcus, lactobacillus, and clostridium, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper represents the first comparison of phage genomes in the paenibacillus genus and the first organization of p. larvae phages based on sequence and structure. this analysis provides an important contribution to the field of bacteriophage genomics by serving as a foundation on which to build an understanding of the natural predators of p. larvae.
