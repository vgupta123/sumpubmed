BACKGROUND
haemophili are representative microbiota of the upper respiratory tract. the aim of this study was to assess the effects of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis and/or postoperative treatment on haemophilus parainfluenzae prevalence, and antimicrobial sensitivity in short-term hospitalized patients with lung cancer who underwent surgery.


RESULTS
samples were collected from  <dig> short-term hospitalized patients with lung cancer and from  <dig> healthy people. the nasal and throat specimens were taken twice from each patient: before , on the fourth/fifth day  after surgery, and once from healthy people. the isolates identification and antimicrobial susceptibility were detected by routine diagnostic methods. h. parainfluenzae was found in throat specimens of 42/ <dig>  healthy people, while in 19/ <dig>  lung cancer patients in ei  and in 13/ <dig>  ones in eii . neither the disease itself nor short-term hospitalization with perioperative prophylaxis alone affected h. parainfluenzae prevalence in eii, while perioperative prophylaxis with postoperative treatment significantly decreased its colonization in eii. the differences in the number of patients colonized by candida spp. in ei and in eii were observed .totally, 23/ <dig>  of h. parainfluenzae isolates were resistant mainly to beta-lactams; among  <dig> ampicillin-resistant isolates only  <dig> were beta-lactamase positive.


CONCLUSIONS
the antimicrobial perioperative prophylaxis together with postoperative treatment may disturb the composition of the airways microbiota represented by h. parainfluenzae, in addition to selecting the resistant strains of bacteria and promoting yeasts colonization in lung cancer patients undergoing surgery.
