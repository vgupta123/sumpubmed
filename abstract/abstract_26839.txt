BACKGROUND
the mycobacteriophage large serine recombinase bxb <dig> catalyzes site-specific recombination between its corresponding attp and attb recognition sites. previously, we and others have shown that bxb <dig> has catalytic activity in various eukaryotic species including nicotiana tabacum, schizosaccharomyces pombe, insects and mammalian cells.


RESULTS
in this work, the bxb <dig> recombinase gene was transformed and constitutively expressed in arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring a chromosomally integrated attp and attb-flanked target sequence. the bxb <dig> recombinase successfully excised the target sequence in a conservative manner and the resulting recombination event was heritably transmitted to subsequent generations in the absence of the recombinase transgene. in addition, we also show that bxb <dig> recombinase expressing plants can be manually crossed with att-flanked target transgenic plants to generate excised progeny.


CONCLUSIONS
the bxb <dig> large serine recombinase performs site-specific recombination in arabidopsis thaliana germinal tissue, producing stable lines free of unwanted dna. the precise site-specific deletion produced by bxb <dig> in planta demonstrates that this enzyme can be a useful tool for the genetic engineering of plants without selectable marker transgenes or other undesirable exogenous sequences.
