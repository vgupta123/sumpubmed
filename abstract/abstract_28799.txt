BACKGROUND
plants respond to abiotic stress on physiological, biochemical and molecular levels. this includes a global change in their cellular proteome achieved by changes in the pattern of their protein synthesis and degradation. the ubiquitin-proteasome system  is a key player in protein degradation in eukaryotes. proteins are marked for degradation by the proteasome by coupling short chains of ubiquitin polypeptides in a three-step pathway. the last and regulatory stage is catalyzed by a member of a large family of substrate-specific ubiquitin ligases.


RESULTS
we have identified atpub <dig> and atpub48—two paralogous genes that encode ubiquitin ligases —to have a role in the plant environmental response. the atpub <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> appear as tandem gene copies on chromosome  <dig>  and we present a phylogenetic analysis that traces their evolution from an ancestral pub-arm gene. single homozygous t-dna insertion mutants of atpub <dig> and atpub <dig> displayed hypersensitivity to water stress; this was not observed for similar mutants of atpub <dig>  although the three genes show a similar spatial expression pattern, the steady state levels of their transcripts are differentially affected by abiotic stresses and plant hormones.


CONCLUSIONS

atpub <dig> and atpub <dig> encode plant u-box e3s and are involved in the response to water stress. our data suggest that despite encoding highly homologous proteins, atpub <dig> and atpub <dig> biological activity does not fully overlap.
