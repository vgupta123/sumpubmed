BACKGROUND
association mapping approaches are dependent upon discovery and validation of single nucleotide polymorphisms . to further association studies in anopheles gambiae we conducted a major resequencing programme, primarily targeting regions within or close to candidate genes for insecticide resistance.


RESULTS
using two pools of mosquito template dna we sequenced over  <dig> kbp across  <dig> distinct amplicons of the an. gambiae genome. comparison of snps identified from pooled templates with those from individual sequences revealed a very low false positive rate. false negative rates were much higher and mostly resulted from snps with a low minor allele frequency. pooled-template sequencing also provided good estimates of snp allele frequencies. allele frequency estimation success, along with false positive and negative call rates, improved significantly when using a qualitative measure of snp call quality. we identified a total of  <dig> polymorphic features comprising  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels, with, on average, a snp every  <dig> bp; a high rate of polymorphism that is comparable to other studies of mosquitoes. snps were significantly more frequent in members of the cytochrome p <dig> mono-oxygenases and carboxy/cholinesterase gene-families than in glutathione-s-transferases, other detoxification genes, and control genomic regions. polymorphic sites showed a significantly clustered distribution, but the degree of snp clustering  did not vary among gene families, suggesting that clustering of polymorphisms is a general property of the an. gambiae genome.


CONCLUSIONS
the high frequency and clustering of snps has important ramifications for the design of high-throughput genotyping assays based on allele specific primer extension or probe hybridisation. we illustrate these issues in the context of the design of illumina goldengate assays.
