BACKGROUND
in quantitative proteomics, peptide mapping is a valuable approach to combine positional quantitative information with topographical and domain information of proteins. quantitative proteomic analysis of cell surface shedding is an exemplary application area of this approach.


RESULTS
we developed improviser  for fully automated peptide mapping of quantitative proteomics data in the protxml data. the tool generates sortable and graphically annotated output, which can be easily shared with further users. as an exemplary application, we show its usage in the proteomic analysis of regulated intramembrane proteolysis.


CONCLUSIONS
improviser is the first tool to enable automated peptide mapping of the widely-used protxml format.
