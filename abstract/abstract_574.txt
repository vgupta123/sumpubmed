BACKGROUND
immortalized neuronal cell lines can be induced to differentiate into more mature neurons by adding specific compounds or growth factors to the culture medium. this property makes neuronal cell lines attractive as in vitro cell models to study neuronal functions and neurotoxicity. the clonal human neuroblastoma be-m <dig> cell line is known to differentiate into a more prominent neuronal cell type by treatment with trans-retinoic acid. however, there is a lack of information on the morphological and functional aspects of these differentiated cells.


RESULTS
we studied the effects of trans-retinoic acid treatment on  some differentiation marker proteins,  types of voltage-gated calcium  channels and  ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter  release in cultured be-m <dig> cells. cells treated with  <dig> μm trans-retinoic acid  for  <dig> hrs exhibited marked changes in morphology to include neurite extensions; presence of p/q, n and t-type voltage-gated ca2+ channels; and expression of neuron specific enolase , synaptosomal-associated protein  <dig> , nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α <dig>  and other neuronal markers. moreover, retinoic acid treated cells had a significant increase in evoked ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release capacity. in toxicity studies of the toxic gas, phosgene , that differentiation of m <dig> cells with ra was required to see the changes in intracellular free ca2+ concentrations following exposure to cg.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, retinoic acid treated cells had improved morphological features as well as neuronal characteristics and functions; thus, these retinoic acid differentiated be-m <dig> cells may serve as a better neuronal model to study neurobiology and/or neurotoxicity.
