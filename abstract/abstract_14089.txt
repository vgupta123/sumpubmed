BACKGROUND
spring viraemia of carp virus  has been identified as the causative agent of spring viraemia of carp  and it has caused significant losses in the cultured common carp  industry. the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of the disease remain poorly understood. in this study, deep rna sequencing was used to analyse the transcriptome and gene expression profile of epc cells at progressive times after svcv infection. this study addressed the complexity of virus–cell interactions and added knowledge that may help to understand svcv.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean data from  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads, with a mean read length  <dig> bp, were obtained. these raw data were assembled into  <dig>  contigs. of these contigs,  <dig>  and  <dig>  had significant hits to the nr and uniprot databases where they matched  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique protein accessions, respectively. at  <dig> h post svcv infection , a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in epc cells compared to non-infected cells, including  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes. these regulated genes were primarily involved in pathways of apoptosis, oxidative stress and the interferon system, all of which may be involved in viral pathogenesis. in addition,  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were validated by quantitative pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate previously unrecognised changes in gene transcription that are associated with svcv infection in vitro, and many potential cascades identified in the study clearly warrant further experimental investigation. our data provide new clues to the mechanism of viral susceptibility in epc cells.
