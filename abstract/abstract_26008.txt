BACKGROUND
although dna sequence analysis is becoming a powerful tool for identifying species, it is not easy to assess whether the observed genetic disparity corresponds to reproductive isolation. here, we compared the efficiency of biological species identification between nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast dna sequences, focusing on an asian endemic perennial lineage of mitella . we performed artificial cross experiments for  <dig> pairs of ten taxonomic species, and examined their f <dig> hybrid pollen fertility in vitro as a quantitative measure of postzygotic reproductive isolation.


RESULTS
a nonlinear, multiple regression analysis indicated that the nuclear ribosomal dna distances are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of f <dig> hybrid pollen fertility, and supplementation with chloroplast dna distance data does not improve the explanatory power. overall, with the exception of a recently diverged species complex with more than three biological species, nuclear ribosomal dna sequences successfully circumscribed ten distinct biological species, of which two have not been described  to date.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that nuclear ribosomal dna sequences contribute to reliable identification of reproductively isolated and cryptic species of mitella. more comparable studies for other plant groups are needed to generalize our findings to flowering plants.
