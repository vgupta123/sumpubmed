BACKGROUND
neuropathic pain evoked by nerve injury is frequently accompanied by deterioration of emotional behaviors, but the underlying signaling mechanisms remain elusive. glutamate  is the major mediator of excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the brain, and abnormal activity of the glutamatergic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of pain and associated emotional comorbidities. in this study we used the partial sciatic nerve ligation  model of neuropathic pain in rats to characterize the development of anxiety-like behavior, the expression of glutamatergic receptors, and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase  in the hippocampus, the region that encodes memories related to emotions.


RESULTS
we found that the mechanical withdrawal threshold was significantly reduced and an anxiety-like behavior was increased as determined via open field tests and elevated plus-maze tests at 28 days after injury. no significant differences were found in the ratio of sucrose preference and immobility time detected by sucrose preference tests and forced swimming tests respectively, possibly due to the timing factor. the expression of n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor subtypes nr <dig> and nr2b, but not nr2a, glur <dig>  or glur <dig>  in the hippocampus of injured rats was significantly reduced. moreover, psnl resulted in decreased phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in the hippocampus. intriguingly, treatment with d-serine  reduced the anxiety-like behavior but not the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by psnl.


CONCLUSIONS
psnl can induce significant anxiety-like but not depression-like behavior, and trigger down-regulation of nmda but not ampa receptors in the hippocampus at 28 days after injury.
