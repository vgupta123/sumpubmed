BACKGROUND
cart  peptide and cholecystokinin  are neuromodulators involved in feeding behavior. this study is based on previously found synergistic effect of leptin and cck on food intake and our hypothesis on a co-operation of the cart peptide and cck in food intake regulation and fos activation in their common targets, the nucleus tractus solitarii of the brainstem , the paraventricular nucleus , and the dorsomedial nucleus  of the hypothalamus.


RESULTS
in fasted c57bl/ <dig> mice, the anorexigenic effect of cart in the doses of  <dig>  or  <dig>  μg/mouse was significantly enhanced by low doses of cck- <dig> of  <dig>  or  <dig> μg/kg, while  <dig> mg/kg dose of cck-a receptor antagonist devazepide blocked the effect of cart on food intake. after simultaneous administration of  <dig>  μg/mouse cart and of  <dig> μg/kg of cck- <dig>  the number of fos-positive neurons in nts, pvn, and dmh was significantly higher than after administration of each particular peptide. besides, cart and cck- <dig> showed an additive effect on inhibition of the locomotor activity of mice in an open field test.


CONCLUSIONS
the synergistic and long-lasting effect of the cart peptide and cck on food intake and their additive effect on fos immunoreactivity in their common targets suggest a co-operative action of cart peptide and cck which could be related to synergistic effect of leptin on cck satiety.
