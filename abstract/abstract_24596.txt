BACKGROUND
synthetic genetic transistors are vital for signal amplification and switching in genetic circuits. however, it is still problematic to efficiently select the adequate promoters, ribosome binding sides  and inducer concentrations to construct a genetic transistor with the desired linear amplification or switching in the input/output  characteristics for practical applications.


RESULTS
three kinds of promoter-rbs libraries, i.e., a constitutive promoter-rbs library, a repressor-regulated promoter-rbs library and an activator-regulated promoter-rbs library, are constructed for systematic genetic circuit design using the identified kinetic strengths of their promoter-rbs components.

according to the dynamic model of genetic transistors, a design methodology for genetic transistors via a genetic algorithm -based searching algorithm is developed to search for a set of promoter-rbs components and adequate concentrations of inducers to achieve the prescribed i/o characteristics of a genetic transistor. furthermore, according to design specifications for different types of genetic transistors, a look-up table is built for genetic transistor design, from which we could easily select an adequate set of promoter-rbs components and adequate concentrations of external inducers for a specific genetic transistor.


CONCLUSIONS
this systematic design method will reduce the time spent using trial-and-error methods in the experimental procedure for a genetic transistor with a desired i/o characteristic. we demonstrate the applicability of our design methodology to genetic transistors that have desirable linear amplification or switching by employing promoter-rbs library searching.
