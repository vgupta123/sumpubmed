BACKGROUND
a number of gene expression studies have investigated changes induced by drug exposure, but few reports describe changes that persist following relapse. in this study, genome-wide analysis of gene expression was conducted following an extinction session  in rats that expressed behavioral incubation of heroin-seeking and goal-directed behavior. as an important modulator of goal-directed behavior, the medial prefrontal cortex  was the target of genomic analysis. rats were trained to self-administer heroin during  <dig> h daily sessions for  <dig> d. following the self-administration period, rats were reintroduced to the self-administration chambers for a 90-minute extinction session in which they could seek heroin, but received none. extinction sessions were conducted on groups after either  <dig> d or  <dig> d of drug-free enforced abstinence to demonstrate behavioral incubation.


RESULTS
behavioral data demonstrated incubation  of heroin-seeking and goal-directed behavior after the  <dig> d abstinent period. that is, following  <dig> d of enforced abstinence, animals displayed heightened drug-seeking behavior when returned to the environment where they had previously received heroin. this increased drug-seeking took place despite the fact that they received no drug during this extinction session. whole genome gene expression analysis was performed and results were confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr . microarrays identified  <dig> genes whose expression was identified as changed by at least  <dig>  fold  following  <dig> d of abstinence and the 90-minute extinction session compared to the saline treated controls. orthogonal confirmation by rt-qpcr demonstrated significant alterations in bdnf, calb <dig>  dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  egr <dig>  npy, rgs <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
ontological analysis indicates that several of the genes confirmed to be changed are important for neuroplasticity, and through that role may impact learning and behavior. the importance of drug-seeking behavior and memory of previous drug-taking sessions suggest that such genes may be important for relapse. the global gene expression analysis adds to the knowledge of heroin-induced changes and further highlights similarities between heroin and other drugs of abuse.
