BACKGROUND
tata-box-binding protein  <dig>  is a vertebrate-specific paralog of tbp that shares with tbp a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain and the ability to bind the tata box. tbp <dig> is highly expressed in oocytes whereas tbp is more abundant in embryos.


RESULTS
we find that tbp <dig> is proteolytically degraded upon meiotic maturation; after germinal vesicle breakdown relatively low levels of tbp <dig> expression persist. furthermore, tbp <dig> localizes to the transcriptionally active loops of lampbrush chromosomes and is recruited to a number of injected promoters in oocyte nuclei. using an altered binding specificity mutant reporter system we show that tbp <dig> promotes rna polymerase ii transcription in vivo. intriguingly, tbp, which in oocytes is undetectable at the protein level, can functionally replace tbp <dig> when ectopically expressed in oocytes, showing that switching of initiation factors can be driven by changes in their expression. proteolytic degradation of tbp <dig> is not required for repression of transcription during meiotic maturation, suggesting a redundant role in this repression or a role in initiation factor switching between oocytes and embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
the expression and transcriptional activity of tbp <dig> in oocytes show that tbp <dig> is the predominant initiation factor in oocytes, which is substituted by tbp on a subset of promoters in embryos as a result of proteolytic degradation of tbp <dig> during meiotic maturation.
