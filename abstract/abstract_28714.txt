BACKGROUND
nkx <dig>  and arx represent key transcription factors implicated in the specification of islet cell subtypes during pancreas development. mice deficient for arx do not develop any alpha-cells whereas beta- and delta-cells are found in considerably higher numbers. in nkx <dig>  mutant animals, alpha- and beta-cell development is severely impaired whereas a ghrelin-expressing cell population is found augmented.

notably, arx transcription is clearly enhanced in nkx <dig> -deficient pancreata. hence in order to precise the functional link between both factors we performed a comparative analysis of nkx <dig> /arx single- and double-mutants but also of pax6-deficient animals.


RESULTS
we show that most of the ghrelin+ cells emerging in pancreata of nkx <dig> - and pax6-deficient mice, express the alpha-cell specifier arx, but also additional beta-cell related genes. in nkx <dig> -deficient mice, arx directly co-localizes with iapp, pc1/ <dig> and pdx <dig> suggesting an nkx <dig> -dependent control of arx in committed beta-cells. the combined loss of nkx <dig>  and arx likewise results in the formation of a hyperplastic ghrelin+ cell population at the expense of mature alpha- and beta-cells. surprisingly, such nkx <dig> -/-arx- ghrelin+ cells also express the somatostatin hormone.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that nkx <dig>  acts by reinforcing the transcriptional networks initiated by pax <dig> and arx in early committed beta- and alpha-cell, respectively. our analysis also suggests that one of the coupled functions of nkx <dig>  and pax <dig> is to counteract arx gene activity in early committed beta-cells.
