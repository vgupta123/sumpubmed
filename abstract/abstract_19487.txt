BACKGROUND
myostatin  encodes a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass that might have applications for promoting muscle growth in livestock. in this study, we aimed to test whether targeted mstn editing, mediated by transcription activator-like effector nucleases , is a viable approach to create myostatin-modified goats .


RESULTS
we obtained a pair of talens  that could recognize and cut the targeted mstn site in the goat genome. fibroblasts from pedigreed goats were co-transfected with mtal- <dig>  and  <dig> monoclonal cell strains were confirmed to have mono- or bi-allelic mutations in mstn. ten cell strains with different genotypes were used as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer, which produced three cloned kids .


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that the mtal- <dig> could disrupt mstn efficiently in the goat genome. the mutated somatic cells could be used to produce mstn-site mutated goats without developmental disruption. thus, talens is an effective method for accurate genome editing to produce site-modified goats.
