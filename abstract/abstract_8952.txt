BACKGROUND
with the advent of high throughput genomic tools, it is now possible to undertake detailed molecular studies of individual species outside traditional model organisms. combined with a good understanding of physiological processes, these tools allow researchers to explore natural diversity, giving a better understanding of biological mechanisms. here a detailed study of fruit development from anthesis through to fruit senescence is presented for a non-model organism, kiwifruit, actinidia chinensis .


RESULTS
consistent with previous studies, it was found that many aspects of fruit morphology, growth and development are similar to those of the model fruit tomato, except for a striking difference in fruit ripening progression. the early stages of fruit ripening occur as the fruit is still growing, and many ripening events are not associated with autocatalytic ethylene production . autocatalytic ethylene is produced late in the ripening process as the fruit begins to senesce.


CONCLUSIONS
by aligning a. chinensis fruit development to a phenological scale, this study provides a reference framework for subsequent physiological and genomic studies, and will allow cross comparison across fruit species, leading to a greater understanding of the diversity of fruits found across the plant kingdom.
