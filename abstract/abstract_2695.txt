BACKGROUND
to examine which language function depends on early experience, the present study compared deaf native signers, deaf non-native signers and hearing german native speakers while processing german sentences. the participants watched simple written sentences while event-related potentials  were recorded. at the end of each sentence they were asked to judge whether the sentence was correct or not. two types of violations were introduced in the middle of the sentence: a semantically implausible noun or a violation of subject-verb number agreement.


RESULTS
the results showed a similar erp pattern after semantic violations  in all three groups. after syntactic violations, native german speakers and native signers of german sign language  with german as second language  showed a left anterior negativity  followed by a p <dig>  whereas no lan but a negativity over the right hemisphere instead was found in deaf participants with a delayed onset of first language  acquisition. the p <dig> of this group had a smaller amplitude and a different scalp distribution as compared to german native speakers.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study suggest that language deprivation in early childhood alters the cerebral organization of syntactic language processing mechanisms for l <dig>  semantic language processing instead was unaffected.
