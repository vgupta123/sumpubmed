BACKGROUND
by mapping the dynamics of brain reorganization, functional magnetic resonance imaging mri  has allowed for significant progress in understanding cerebral plasticity phenomena after a stroke. however, cerebro-vascular diseases can affect blood oxygen level dependent  signal. cerebral autoregulation is a primary function of cerebral hemodynamics, which allows to maintain a relatively constant blood flow despite changes in arterial blood pressure and perfusion pressure. cerebral autoregulation is reported to become less effective in the early phases post-stroke.

this study investigated whether any impairment of cerebral hemodynamics that occurs during the acute and the subacute phases of ischemic stroke is related to changes in bold response.

we enrolled six aphasic patients affected by acute stroke. all patients underwent a transcranial doppler to assess cerebral autoregulation  and fmri to evaluate the amplitude and the peak latency  of bold response in the acute  and the subacute  stroke phases.


RESULTS
as patients advanced from the acute to subacute stroke phase, the affected hemisphere presented a bold ttp increase  and a deterioration of cerebral autoregulation . a similar but not significant trend was observed also in the unaffected hemisphere. when the two hemispheres were grouped together, bold ttp delay was significantly related to worsening cerebral autoregulation  .


CONCLUSIONS
the hemodynamic response function subtending bold signal may present a delay in peak latency that arises as patients advance from the acute to the subacute stroke phase. this delay is related to the deterioration of cerebral hemodynamics. these findings suggest that remodeling the fmri hemodynamic response function in the different phases of stroke may optimize the detection of bold signal changes.
