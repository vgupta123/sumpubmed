BACKGROUND
the maize kernel row number  is a key component that contributes to grain yield and has high broad-sense heritability . quantitative trait locus/loci  mapping using a high-density genetic map is a powerful approach to detecting loci that are responsible for traits of interest. bulked segregant ribonucleic acid  sequencing  is another rapid and cost-effective strategy to identify qtl. combining qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map and bsr-seq may dissect comprehensively the genetic architecture underlying the maize krn.


RESULTS
a panel of 300 f <dig> individuals derived from inbred lines abe <dig> and b <dig> were genotyped using the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing  method. a total of  <dig>  high-quality polymorphic slaf markers were obtained and used to construct a high-density genetic map with a total length of  <dig>  centimorgan  and an average distance between adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm. combining the genetic map and krn of f <dig> individuals, four qtl  were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the physical intervals of these four qtl ranged from  <dig>  mb for qkrn8- <dig> to  <dig>  mb for qkrn <dig> with an average value of  <dig>  mb. based on high-throughput sequencing of two rna pools bulked from leaves of plants with extremely high and low krns, two qtl were detected on chromosome  <dig> in the 10–25 mb  and 60–150 mb  intervals. according to the physical positions of these qtl, qkrn8- <dig> was included by bsr_qtl <dig>  in addition, qkrn8- <dig> was validated using qtl mapping with a recombinant inbred lines population that was derived from inbred lines abe <dig> and b <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proved that combining qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map and bsr-seq is a powerful and cost-effective approach to comprehensively revealing genetic architecture underlying traits of interest. the qtl for the krn detected in this study, especially qkrn8- <dig>  can be used for performing fine mapping experiments and marker-assisted selection in maize breeding.
