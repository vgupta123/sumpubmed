BACKGROUND
rsf <dig> is a well-studied broad-host-range plasmid able to be mobilized to different bacteria and plants. rsf1010-derived plasmid vectors are widely used in both basic research and industrial applications. in the latter case, exploiting of mobilizable plasmids or even the plasmids possessing negligible mobilization frequency, but containing dna fragments that could promote conjugal transfer, is undesirable because of biosafety considerations. previously, several mutations significantly decreasing efficiency of rsf <dig> mobilization have been selected. nevertheless, construction of the rsf <dig> derivative lacking all known loci involved in the conjugal transfer has not been reported yet.


RESULTS
novel non-mobilizable derivatives of rsf <dig> lacking all known dna sequences involved in the mobilization process have been obtained due to the exploiting of λred-driven recombination between the plasmid and a constructed in vitro linear dna fragment. to provide auto-regulated transcription of the essential replication gene, repb, the plasmid loci orit, mobc and moba were substituted by the dna fragment containing placuv5→laci. mobilization of the obtained rsfmob plasmid was not detected in standard tests. the derivative of rsfmob with increased copy number has been obtained after laci elimination. high stability of both constructed plasmids has been demonstrated in escherichia coli and pantoea ananatis. design of rsfmob allows easy substitution of placuv <dig> by any desirable promoter for construction of novel derivatives with changed copy number or host range.


CONCLUSIONS
novel non-mobilizable derivatives of rsf <dig> lacking all known dna sequences involved in the mobilization process and stably maintained at least in e. coli and p. ananatis have been constructed. the obtained plasmids became the progenitors of new cloning vectors answering all biosafety requirements of genetically modified organisms used in scale-up production.
