BACKGROUND
metalloproteinase inhibitors can protect mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , an animal model for multiple sclerosis . matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  has been implicated, but it is not clear if other mmps are also involved, including matrilysin/mmp- <dig> – an enzyme capable of cleaving proteins that are essential for blood brain barrier integrity and immune suppression.


RESULTS
here we report that mmp-7-deficient  mice on the c57bl/ <dig> background are resistant to eae induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein . brain sections from mog-primed mmp7-/-mice did not show signs of immune cell infiltration of the cns, but mog-primed wild-type mice showed extensive vascular cuffing and mononuclear cell infiltration  <dig> days after vaccination. at the peak of eae wild-type mice had mmp- <dig> immuno-reactive cells in vascular cuffs that also expressed the macrophage markers iba- <dig> and gr- <dig>  as well as tomato lectin. mog-specific proliferation of splenocytes, lymphocytes, cd4+ and cd8+ cells were reduced in cells isolated from mog-primed mmp7-/- mice, compared with mog-primed wild-type mice. however, the adoptive transfer of splenocytes and lymphocytes from mog-primed mmp7-/- mice induced eae in naïve wild-type recipients, but not naïve mmp7-/- recipients. finally, we found that recombinant mmp- <dig> increased permeability between endothelial cells in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that mmp- <dig> may facilitate immune cell access or re-stimulation in perivascular areas, which are critical events in eae and multiple sclerosis, and provide a new therapeutic target to treat this disorder.
