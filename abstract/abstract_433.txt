BACKGROUND
hepatitis c virus  core protein and nonstructural protein 4b  are potentially oncogenic. aberrant activation of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is closely associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. we investigated the effects of hcv type 1b core protein and ns4b on wnt/β-catenin signaling in various liver cells, and explored the molecular mechanism underlying hcv-related hepatocarcinogenesis.


RESULTS
compared with the empty vector control, hcv core protein and ns4b demonstrated the following characteristics in the huh <dig> cells: significantly enhanced β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity ; increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin ; upregulated nuclear β-catenin, cytoplasmic β-catenin, wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclin d <dig> protein expression ; and promoted proliferation of huh <dig> cells . neither protein enhanced β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity in the lo <dig> cells , but they did significantly enhance wnt3a-induced β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity , and promoted the nuclear translocation of β-catenin  and the wnt3a-induced proliferation of lo <dig> cells . moreover, activation of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was greater with the core protein than with ns4b .


CONCLUSIONS
hcv core protein and ns4b directly activate the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in huh <dig> cells and lo <dig> cells induced by wnt3a. these data suggest that hcv core protein and ns4b contribute to hcv-associated hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
