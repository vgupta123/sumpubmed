BACKGROUND
multi-drug resistant klebsiella pneumoniae strains are a common cause of health care associated infections worldwide. clonal spread of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates carrying plasmid mediated ctx-m- <dig> have been commonly reported. limited data is available regarding dissemination of chromosomally encoded ctx-m- <dig> in klebsiella pneumoniae worldwide.


RESULTS
we examined  <dig> non-repetitive esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from clinical specimens over a period of 4 months in a german university hospital. all isolates were characterized to determine their genetic relatedness using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multi locus sequence typing . pfge revealed three clusters  with a sub-cluster  comprising of  <dig> isolates with an identical pfge pattern. all strains of the cluster b <dig> with similar pfge patterns were typed as st <dig>  indicating an outbreak situation. the esbl allele blactx-m- <dig> was identified in  <dig>  of all isolates, including all of the outbreak strains. within the a <dig> sub-cluster, the ctx-m- <dig> allele could not be transferred by conjugation. dna hybridization studies suggested a chromosomal location of blactx-m- <dig>  whole genome sequencing located ctx-m- <dig> within a complete isecp- <dig> transposition unit inserted into an orf encoding for a putative membrane protein. pcr-based analysis of the flanking regions demonstrated that insertion into this region is unique and present in all outbreak isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first characterization of a chromosomal insertion of blactx-m- <dig> in klebsiella pneumonia st <dig>  a finding suggesting that in enterobacteriaceae, chromosomal locations may also act as reservoirs for the spread of blactx-m- <dig> encoding transposition units.
