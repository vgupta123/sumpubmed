BACKGROUND
lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide  remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children. the damage to membrane phospholipids leads to the collapse of the bronchial alveolar epithelial barrier during acute lung injury /acute respiratory distress syndrome . phospholipase a <dig> , a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, plays an important traumatic role in pulmonary inflammation, and clara cell secretory protein  is an endogenous inhibitor of pla <dig>  our previous study showed that polydatin , a monocrystalline extracted from a traditional chinese medicinal herb , reduced pla <dig> activity and spla2-iia mrna expression and mitigated lps-induced lung injury. however, the potential mechanism for these effects has not been well defined. we have continued to investigate the effect of pd on lps-induced expression of ccsp mrna and protein in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
our results suggested that the ccsp mrna level was consistent with its protein expression. ccsp expression was decreased in lung after lps challenge. in contrast, pd markedly increased ccsp expression in a concentration-dependent manner. in particular, ccsp expression in pd-pretreated rat lung was higher than in rats receiving only pd treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicated that up-regulation of ccsp expression causing inhibition of pla <dig> activation may be one of the crucial protective mechanisms of pd in lps-induced lung injury.
