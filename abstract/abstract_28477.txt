BACKGROUND
bir family proteins are evolutionarily conserved anti-apoptotic molecules. one member of xenopus bir family proteins, xeiap/xlx, is a weak apoptosis inhibitor and rapidly degraded in a cell-free apoptotic execution system derived from interphase egg extracts. however, unfertilized eggs are naturally arrested at the metaphase of meiosis ii by the concerted activities of mos-mek-p42mapk-p90rsk kinase cascade  and many mitotic kinases. previous studies suggest that cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts are more resistant to spontaneous apoptosis than interphase egg extracts in a p42mapk-dependent manner. we tested whether xeiap/xlx might be phosphorylated in cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts, and also examined whether xeiap/xlx could be functionally regulated by phosphorylation.


RESULTS
we found that p42mapk was the major kinase phosphorylating xeiap/xlx in cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts, and three ser residues  were identified as p42mapk-mediated phosphorylation sites. we characterized the behaviors of various xeiap/xlx mutants that could not be phosphorylated by p42mapk. however, neither protein stability nor anti-apoptotic ability of xeiap/xlx was significantly altered by the substitution of ser with either ala or asp at these three sites.


CONCLUSIONS
xeiap/xlx is physiologically phosphorylated by p42mapk in xenopus unfertilized eggs. however, this protein may not serve as an essential mediator of p42mapk-dependent anti-apoptotic activity.
