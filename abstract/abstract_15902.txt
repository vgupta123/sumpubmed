BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis  must adapt to various stress conditions during host infection. the two-component regulatory system  senx3-regx <dig> is required for mtb virulence. we showed recently that the senx3-regx <dig> intergenic region contains promoter activity, driving senx3-independent regx <dig> expression. in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that regx <dig> has a senx3-independent role in mtb virulence. the gene expression patterns, growth, and survival of mutants containing transposon insertions in senx <dig>  and regx <dig>  were compared to those of their respective complemented strains and the isogenic wild-type parent strain during axenic growth in nutrient-rich broth, phosphate depletion, nutrient starvation, and in the lungs of balb/c mice.


RESULTS
regx <dig> expression was reduced in senx3::tn during phosphate depletion and nutrient starvation, and expression of the phosphate-specific transport gene pstc <dig> was reduced similarly in senx3::tn and regx3::tn during phosphate depletion. although senx <dig> and regx <dig> were each dispensable for mtb growth in nutrient-rich broth, disruption of senx <dig> or regx <dig> caused a similar growth defect during phosphate depletion. interestingly, senx3::tn, in which monocistronic regx <dig> expression is preserved, showed significantly higher survival relative to regx3::tn after 7 days of nutrient starvation , and in mouse lungs at day  <dig> , day  <dig> , and day  <dig>  after aerosol infection.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate the specificity of the senx3-regx <dig> 2crs for sensing and responding to low ambient phosphate, but also raise the possibility that regx <dig> may function independently of its cognate sensor histidine kinase.
