BACKGROUND
the mongolian gerbils are a good model to mimic the helicobacter pylori-associated pathogenesis of the human stomach. in the current study the gerbil-adapted strain b <dig> was completely sequenced, annotated and compared to previous genomes, including the  <dig> supercontigs of the parental strain b <dig> 


RESULTS
the complete genome of h. pylori b <dig> was manually curated gene by gene, to assign as much function as possible. it consists of a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp and of a small plasmid of  <dig>  bp carrying nine putative genes. the chromosome contains  <dig>  coding sequences,  <dig> of which are strain-specific, coding mainly for hypothetical proteins, and a large plasticity zone containing a putative type-iv-secretion system and coding sequences with unknown function. the cag-pathogenicity island is rearranged such that the caga-gene is located  <dig>  bp downstream of the inverted gene cluster cagb-cag <dig>  directly adjacent to the caga-gene, there are four hypothetical genes and one variable gene with a different codon usage compared to the rest of the h. pylori b8-genome. this indicates that these coding sequences might be acquired via horizontal gene transfer.

the genome comparison of strain b <dig> to its parental strain b <dig> delivers  <dig> unique b8-proteins. due to the fact that strain b <dig> was not fully sequenced and only automatically annotated, only  <dig> of these proteins are definitive singletons that might have been acquired during the gerbil-adaptation process of strain b <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our sequence data and its analysis provide new insight into the high genetic diversity of h. pylori-strains. we have shown that the gerbil-adapted strain b <dig> has the potential to build, possibly by a high rate of mutation and recombination, a dynamic pool of genetic variants  required for the adaptation-processes. we hypothesize that these variants are essential for the colonization and persistence of strain b <dig> in the gerbil stomach during in ammation.
