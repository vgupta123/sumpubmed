BACKGROUND
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases  are cytoplasmic glycolytic enzymes, which although lacking identifiable secretion signals, have also been found localized to the surface of several bacteria ; where in some cases they have been shown to contribute to the colonization and invasion of host tissues. neisseria meningitidis is an obligate human nasopharyngeal commensal which can cause life-threatening infections including septicaemia and meningitis. n. meningitidis has two genes, gapa- <dig> and gapa- <dig>  encoding gapdh enzymes. gapa- <dig> has previously been shown to be up-regulated on bacterial contact with host epithelial cells and is accessible to antibodies on the surface of capsule-permeabilized meningococcal cells. the aims of this study were: 1) to determine whether gapa- <dig> was expressed across different strains of n. meningitidis; 2) to determine whether gapa- <dig> surface accessibility to antibodies was dependant on the presence of capsule; 3) to determine whether gapa- <dig> can influence the interaction of meningococci and host cells, particularly in the key stages of adhesion and invasion.


RESULTS
in this study, expression of gapa- <dig> was shown to be well conserved across diverse isolates of neisseria species. flow cytometry confirmed that gapa- <dig> could be detected on the cell surface, but only in a siad-knockout  background, suggesting that gapa- <dig> is inaccessible to antibody in in vitro-grown encapsulated meningococci. the role of gapa- <dig> in meningococcal pathogenesis was addressed by mutational analysis and functional complementation. loss of gapa- <dig> did not affect the growth of the bacterium in vitro. however, a gapa- <dig> deficient mutant showed a significant reduction in adhesion to human epithelial and endothelial cells compared to the wild-type and complemented mutant. a similar reduction in adhesion levels was also apparent between a siad-deficient meningococcal strain and an isogenic siad gapa- <dig> double mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrates that meningococcal gapa- <dig> is a constitutively-expressed, highly-conserved surface-exposed protein which is antibody-accessible only in the absence of capsule. mutation of gapa- <dig> does not affect the in vitro growth rate of n. meningitidis, but significantly affects the ability of the organism to adhere to human epithelial and endothelial cells in a capsule-independent process suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of meningococcal infection.
