BACKGROUND
cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases play key roles in the metabolism of a wide variety of substrates and they are closely associated with endocellular physiological processes or detoxification metabolism under environmental exposure. to date, however, none has been systematically characterized in the phylum ciliophora. t. thermophila possess many advantages as a eukaryotic model organism and it exhibits rapid and sensitive responses to xenobiotics, making it an ideal model system to study the evolutionary and functional diversity of the p <dig> monooxygenase gene family.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> putative functional cytochrome p <dig> genes were identified and could be classified into  <dig> families and  <dig> sub-families according to standard nomenclature. the characteristics of both the conserved intron-exon organization and scaffold localization of tandem repeats within each p <dig> family clade suggested that the enlargement of t. thermophila p <dig> families probably resulted from recent separate small duplication events. gene expression patterns of all t. thermophila p450s during three important cell physiological stages  were analyzed based on est and microarray data, and three main categories of expression patterns were postulated. evolutionary analysis including codon usage preference, site-specific selection and gene-expression evolution patterns were investigated and the results indicated remarkable divergences among the t. thermophila p <dig> genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the characterization, expression and evolutionary analysis of t. thermophila p <dig> monooxygenase genes in the current study provides useful information for understanding the characteristics and diversities of the p <dig> genes in the ciliophora, and provides the baseline for functional analyses of individual p <dig> isoforms in this model ciliate species.
