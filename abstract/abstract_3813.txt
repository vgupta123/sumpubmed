BACKGROUND
lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase  encoded by a multigene family is a rate-limiting enzyme in the kennedy pathway in higher plants. cotton is the most important natural fiber crop and one of the most important oilseed crops. however, little is known on genes coding for lpaats involved in oil biosynthesis with regard to its genome organization, diversity, expression, natural genetic variation, and association with fiber development and oil content in cotton.


RESULTS
in this study, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis in four gossypium species with genome sequences, i.e., tetraploid g. hirsutum- ad1 and g. barbadense- ad <dig> and its possible ancestral diploids g. raimondii- d <dig> and g. arboreum- a <dig>  identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> lpaat genes, respectively, that were divided into four subfamilies. rna-seq analyses of the lpaat genes in the widely grown g. hirsutum suggest their differential expression at the transcriptional level in developing cottonseeds and fibers. although  <dig> lpaat genes were co-localised with quantitative trait loci  for cottonseed oil or protein content within a 25-cm region, only one single strand conformation polymorphic  marker developed from a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism  of the at-gh13lpaat <dig> gene was significantly correlated with cottonseed oil and protein contents in one of the three field tests. moreover, transformed yeasts using the at-gh13lpaat <dig> gene with the two sequences for the snp led to similar results, i.e., a 25–31% increase in palmitic acid and oleic acid, and a 16–29% increase in total triacylglycerol .


CONCLUSIONS
the results in this study demonstrated that the natural variation in the lpaat genes to improving cottonseed oil content and fiber quality is limited; therefore, traditional cross breeding should not expect much progress in improving cottonseed oil content or fiber quality through a marker-assisted selection for the lpaat genes. however, enhancing the expression of one of the lpaat genes such as at-gh13lpaat <dig> can significantly increase the production of total tag and other fatty acids, providing an incentive for further studies into the use of lpaat genes to increase cottonseed oil content through biotechnology.
