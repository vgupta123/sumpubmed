BACKGROUND
the significance of a unique inhibitory fc receptor for igg, fcγriib , in the prevention of spontaneous production of autoantibodies remains controversial, due mainly to the fact that the riib locus is adjacent to the autoimmune-related slam locus harboring the genes coding for signaling lymphocyte activation molecules, making it difficult to isolate the effect of riib deletion from that of slam in gene-targeted mice. our objective was to determine the influence of riib deletion on the spontaneous development of autoimmune diseases and to compare it with that of potentially pathogenic slam.


RESULTS
we established two congenic c57bl/ <dig>  strains, one with the riib deletion and the other with slam, by backcrossing 129/svj-based riib-deficient mice into the b <dig> genetic background extensively. the riib deficiency indeed led to the production and/or accumulation of a small amount of anti-nuclear autoantibodies  and to weak igg immune-complex deposition in glomeruli without any obvious manifestation of lupus nephritis. in contrast, pathogenic slam in the b <dig> genetic background induced anas but no igg immune-complex deposition in the kidneys. naïve slam mice but not riib-deficient mice exhibited hyperplasia of splenic germinal centers.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results clarify the roles of riib in preventing production and/or accumulation of a small amount of anas, and development of glomerulonephritis. the combined effects of riib deletion and pathogenic slam can lead to severe lupus nephritis in the b <dig> genetic background.
