BACKGROUND
dnaa is an essential protein in the regulation and initiation of dna replication in many bacteria. it forms a protein-dna complex at oric to which dnac loads dnab. dna replication forks initiated at oric by dnaa can collapse on route to the terminus for a variety of reasons. pria, prib, pric, dnat, rep and dnac form multiple pathways to restart repaired replication forks. dnac <dig> and dnac <dig>  are suppressors of pria2::kan mutant phenotypes. the former requires pric and rep while the latter is independent of them. rnha339::cat mutations allow dnaa-independent initiation of dna replication.


RESULTS
it is shown herein that a pric303::kan mutation is synthetically lethal with either a dnaa <dig> or dnaa <dig> temperature sensitive mutation at the permissive temperature of 30°c. the pric-dnaa lethality is specific for the dnaa allele. the pric303::kan mutant was viable when placed in combination with either dnaa <dig>  dnaa <dig>  dnaa <dig> or dnaa <dig>  the pric-dnaa <dig> and pric-dnaa <dig> lethality could be suppressed by rnha339::cat. the pric-dnaa <dig> lethality could be suppressed by a dnac <dig>  mutation, but not dnac <dig>  neither of the dnac mutations could suppress the pric-dnaa <dig> lethality.


CONCLUSIONS
a hitherto unknown function for either dnaa in replication restart or pric in initiation of dna replication that occurs in certain dnaa temperature sensitive mutant strains at the permissive temperature of 30°c has been documented. models considering roles for pric during initiation of dna replication and roles for dnaa in replication restart were tested and found not to decisively explain the data. other roles of dnaa in transcription and nucleoid structure are additionally considered.
