BACKGROUND
the regeneration of peripheral nerve is associated with a change in the alternative splicing of the fibronectin primary gene transcript to re-express embryonic isoforms containing a binding site for α4β <dig> integrins that promote neurite outgrowth. here we use pc <dig> cells to examine the role of the interaction between paxillin and the α <dig> integrin cytoplasmic domain in neurite outgrowth.


RESULTS
expression of α <dig> with mutations in the paxillin-binding domain reduced neurite outgrowth on recombinant embryonic fibronectin fragments relative to wild type α <dig>  over-expression of paxillin promoted neurite outgrowth while a mutant isoform lacking the ld <dig> domain implicated in the regulation of arf and rac gtpases was less effective. optimal α4-mediated migration in leucocytes requires spatial regulation of α <dig> phosphorylation at ser <dig>  a post-translational modification that blocks paxillin binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain. in keeping with this α <dig>  which mimics phosphorylated α <dig>  did not promote neurite outgrowth. however, α <dig> was not phosphorylated in the pc <dig> cells, and a non-phosphorylatable α <dig> mutant promoted neurite outgrowth indistinguishably from the wild type integrin.


CONCLUSIONS
we establish the importance of the α <dig> integrin-paxillin interaction in a model of axonal regeneration and highlight differing dependence on phosphorylation of α <dig> for extension of neuronal growth cones and migration of non-neural cells.
