BACKGROUND
serious infections are common in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation  mainly because of the effects of immunosuppression. the innate immune system plays an important role in the defense against different infections. mannose binding lectin  is a central molecule of the innate immune system. there are several promoter polymorphisms and structural variants of the mbl <dig> gene that encodes for this protein. these variants produce low levels of mbl and have been associated with an increased risk for infections.

methods
prospective cohort study. the incidence, severity of infections and mortality in  <dig> consecutive patients with hematologic diseases who underwent asct between february  <dig> and june  <dig> in a tertiary referral center were analyzed according to their mbl <dig> genotype. inno-lipa mbl <dig> was used for mbl <dig> gene amplification and genotyping. relative risks   as measure of association were calculated. multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression.


RESULTS
a statistically significant higher number of fungal infections was found in patients with mbl <dig> variants causing low mbl levels . in this mbl <dig> variant group infection was more frequently the cause of mortality than in the mbl <dig> wild-type group . although not statistically significant, there was a higher incidence of major infections in the mbl <dig> variant group as well as a higher number of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
low-producer mbl <dig> genotypes were associated with an increased number of fungal infections in asct patients, which would suggest that mbl has a protective role against such infections. asct patients with mbl <dig> variant genotypes are more likely to die as a result of an infection.
