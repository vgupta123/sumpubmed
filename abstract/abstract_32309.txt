BACKGROUND
the green crab carcinus maenas is known for its high acclimation potential to varying environmental abiotic conditions. a high ability for ion and acid-base regulation is mainly based on an efficient regulation apparatus located in gill epithelia. however, at present it is neither known which ion transport proteins play a key role in the acid-base compensation response nor how gill epithelia respond to elevated seawater pco <dig> as predicted for the future. in order to promote our understanding of the responses of green crab acid-base regulatory epithelia to high pco <dig>  baltic sea green crabs were exposed to a pco <dig> of  <dig> pa. gills were screened for differentially expressed gene transcripts using a  <dig> -feature microarray and quantitative real-time pcr.


RESULTS
crabs responded mainly through fine scale adjustment of gene expression to elevated pco <dig>  however, 2% of all investigated transcripts were significantly regulated  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold upon one-week exposure to co <dig> stress. most of the genes known to code for proteins involved in osmo- and acid-base regulation, as well as cellular stress response, were were not impacted by elevated pco <dig>  however, after one week of exposure, significant changes were detected in a calcium-activated chloride channel, a hyperpolarization activated nucleotide-gated potassium channel, a tetraspanin, and an integrin. furthermore, a putative syntaxin-binding protein, a protein of the transmembrane  <dig> superfamily, and a cl-/hco3- exchanger of the slc  <dig> family were differentially regulated. these genes were also affected in a previously published hypoosmotic acclimation response study.


CONCLUSIONS
the moderate, but specific response of c. maenas gill gene expression indicates that  seawater acidification does not act as a strong stressor on the cellular level in gill epithelia;  the response to hypercapnia is to some degree comparable to a hypoosmotic acclimation response;  the specialization of each of the posterior gill arches might go beyond what has been demonstrated up to date; and  a re-configuration of gill epithelia might occur in response to hypercapnia.
