BACKGROUND
peste des petits ruminants is an endemic disease of sheep and goats in nigeria and vaccination has been the method of control but sporadic outbreaks have been reported. this study was carried out to characterize ppr viruses from outbreaks in  <dig> and  <dig> from kaduna and plateau states.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> clinical samples analysed,  <dig> %  were positive for f protein gene primers . all the samples had a sequence similarity of 98-100% among them and 92-97% with the reference vaccine  strain. the deduced amino acid homology ranges between  <dig> - <dig> %. phylogenetically all the nigerian sequences cluster with nig 75/ <dig> and nig 76/ <dig> in lineage  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
ppr is still a problem in kaduna and plateau states of nigeria. the strains involved were genetically closely related to the vaccine strain  used in the country. based on this study, the continued outbreaks in the country is not due to the efficacy of the vaccine. therefore, to achieve effective control and possibly eradication of ppr in nigeria, the current control strategies should be revisited.
