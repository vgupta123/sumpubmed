BACKGROUND
the emerging concept is that micrornas  play a central role in controlling stem cell self-renewal and fate determination by regulating the expression of stem cell regulators. mir-125b, one of neuronal mirnas, recently was found to be necessary for neural differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells . however, the other specific biological role of mir-125b in ns/pcs is little known. we used rat ns/pcs as a model system to study the role of mir-125b in governing the behavior of ns/pcs.


RESULTS
we report here the transfection of exogenous mir-125b inhibited proliferation of ns/pcs but promoted differentiation and migration. whereas anti-mir-125b had the opposite effect. similar results were observed when nestin was knocked down by sirna. subsequently, we demonstrated that nestin was a direct functional target of mir-125b. mir-125b downregulates the expression of luciferase through nestin 3â€™untranslated region , and the regulation was abolished by mutations in the mir-125b binding site. mir-125b targeted the 3'-utr of nestin and reduced the abundance of nestin at both mrna and protein levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the results provided new insight into the function by which mir-125b modulates ns/pcs proliferation, differentiation and migration. the data also indicated the regulatory role of mir-125b in ns/pcs might through the suppression of nestin expression.
