BACKGROUND
during osteoclastogenesis, the maturation of osteoclast  progenitors is stimulated by the receptor activator of nuclear factor-Îºb ligand . excess oc production plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bone disorders. conversely, the inhibition of abnormal oc proliferation reduces inflammation-induced bone loss. low concentrations of carbon monoxide  are known to decrease inflammation and oc-mediated bone erosion but the molecular mechanism is unknown.


RESULTS
to obtain insight into the biological function of co, cultured rankl-treated raw  <dig>  cells were used in an in vitro experimental model of osteoclastogenesis. the results showed that co inhibited: 1) tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase -positive cell formation; 2) f-actin ring production; 3) c-fos pathway activation; 4) the expression of cathepsin k, trap, calcitonin receptor, and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> mrnas; 5) the expression of nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent  <dig> in translation. protein-protein interaction analysis predicted mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase  <dig> as the controlling hub.


CONCLUSIONS
low-concentrations of co  may inhibit osteoclastogenesis. data from string- and ipa-based interactome analyses suggested that the expression of proteins with the functions of signal transduction, enzymes, and epigenetic regulation are significantly altered by co during rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis. our study provides the first interactome analysis of osteoclastogenesis, the results of which supported the negative regulation of oc differentiation by co.
