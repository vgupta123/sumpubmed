BACKGROUND
in many applications, ordinary differential equation  models are subject to uncertainty or variability in initial conditions and parameters. both, uncertainty and variability can be quantified in terms of a probability density function on the state and parameter space.


RESULTS
the partial differential equation that describes the evolution of this probability density function has a form that is particularly amenable to application of the well-known method of characteristics. the value of the density at some point in time is directly accessible by the solution of the original ode extended by a single extra dimension . this leads to simple methods for studying uncertainty, variability and likelihood, with significant advantages over more traditional monte carlo and related approaches especially when studying regions with low probability.


CONCLUSIONS
while such approaches based on the method of characteristics are common practice in other disciplines, their advantages for the study of biological systems have so far remained unrecognized. several examples illustrate performance and accuracy of the approach and its limitations.
