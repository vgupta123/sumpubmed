BACKGROUND
filamentous fungi produce small cysteine rich surface active amphiphilic hydrophobins on the outer surface of cell walls that mediate interactions between the fungus and the environment. the role of hydrophobins in surface hydrophobicity, sporulation, fruit body formation, recognition and adhesion to host surface and virulence have been reported. the aim of the present study was to characterize the biological function of hydrophobins in the fungal biocontrol agent clonostachys rosea in order to understand their potential roles in biocontrol mechanisms.


RESULTS
based on the presence of hydrophobin domains, cysteine spacing patterns and hydropathy plots, we identified three class ii hydrophobin genes in c. rosea. gene expression analysis showed basal expression of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> in all conditions tested with the exception of induced hyd <dig> expression in conidiating mycelium. interestingly, up-regulation of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> was found during c. rosea self interaction compared to interactions with the fungal plant pathogens botrytis cinerea or fusarium graminearum in dual culture assays. phenotypic analysis of c. rosea deletion and complementation strains showed that hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> are jointly required for conidial hydrophobicity, although no difference in mycelia hydrophobicity was found between wild type  and mutant strains. interestingly, mutant strains showed increased growth rates, conidiation and enhanced tolerances of conidia to abiotic stresses. antagonism tests using in vitro dual culture and detached leaf assays showed that the mutant strains were more aggressive towards b. cinerea, f. graminearum or rhizoctonia solani, and that aggression was partly related to earlier conidial germination and enhanced tolerance of mutant strains to secreted fungal metabolites. furthermore, in vitro arabidopsis thaliana root colonization assays revealed reduced root colonization ability of the Δhyd <dig> strain, but not for the Δhyd <dig> strain. furthermore, enhanced root colonization ability for the Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> strain was found in comparison to wt.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show a role for hydrophobins in conidial hydrophobicity, control of conidial germination under stress conditions, and in root colonization in c. rosea. however, functional studies of hyd <dig> remains to be performed in order to fully assess the role of hydrophobins in c. rosea.
