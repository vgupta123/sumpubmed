BACKGROUND
genetic markers are pivotal to modern genomics research; however, discovery and genotyping of molecular markers in oat has been hindered by the size and complexity of the genome, and by a scarcity of sequence data. the purpose of this study was to generate oat expressed sequence tag  information, develop a bioinformatics pipeline for snp discovery, and establish a method for rapid, cost-effective, and straightforward genotyping of snp markers in complex polyploid genomes such as oat.


RESULTS
based on cdna libraries of four cultivated oat genotypes, approximately  <dig>  contigs were assembled from approximately one million roche  <dig> sequence reads. contigs were filtered through a novel bioinformatics pipeline to eliminate ambiguous polymorphism caused by subgenome homology, and  <dig> in silico snps were selected from  <dig>  candidate loci for validation using high-resolution melting  analysis. of these,  <dig>  were polymorphic between parents of the ogle <dig> Ã— tam o- <dig>  mapping population, with  <dig> segregating as single mendelian loci, and  <dig> being placed on the existing ot linkage map. ogle and tam amplicons from  <dig> primers were sequenced for snp validation, revealing complex polymorphism in seven amplicons but general sequence conservation within snp loci. whole-amplicon interrogation with hrm revealed insertions, deletions, and heterozygotes in secondary oat germplasm pools, generating multiple alleles at some primer targets. to validate marker utility,  <dig> snp assays were used to evaluate the genetic diversity of  <dig> diverse oat genotypes. dendrogram clusters corresponded generally to known genome composition and genetic ancestry.


CONCLUSIONS
the high-throughput snp discovery pipeline presented here is a rapid and effective method for identification of polymorphic snp alleles in the oat genome. the current-generation hrm system is a simple and highly-informative platform for snp genotyping. these techniques provide a model for snp discovery and genotyping in other species with complex and poorly-characterized genomes.
