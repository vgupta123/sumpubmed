BACKGROUND
gene duplication has been a fundamental process in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. after duplication one copy  can undergo divergence in sequence, expression pattern, and function. two divergent copies of the ribosomal protein s <dig> gene  of chloroplast origin are found in the nucleus of the rosids arabidopsis, gossypium, and glycine. one encodes chloroplast-imported rps <dig> , while the other encodes mitochondria-imported rps <dig> . the rps <dig> gene has been lost from mitochondrial dna  of many rosids.


RESULTS
we studied sequence evolution of numit rps <dig> in comparison with nucp rps <dig> in seven rosid genera. ka/ks analysis and likelihood ratio tests showed considerably higher ka values and ka/ks ratios in numit rps <dig> than in nucp rps <dig>  indicating increased amino acid sequence divergence in numit rps <dig>  two positively selected codons were detected in numit rps <dig> in regions that are inferred to interact with the 16s rrna. several amino acids in numit rps <dig> have changed from the one present in nucp rps <dig> to the one present in mt rps <dig>  showing that numit rps <dig> is becoming more like mt rps <dig>  comparison of expression patterns and levels of numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> in arabidopsis using microarray data indicated divergence in gene expression. we discovered that in addition to numit rps <dig>  malus  contains a transcribed mt rps <dig> gene. to determine if partitioning of expression takes place between numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig>  expression of both copies and rna editing of mt rps <dig> were examined by rt-pcr, qrt-pcr, and sequencing from  <dig> different organ types plus seedlings subjected to five different abiotic stresses. co-expression of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> was observed in all the organs and various stress treatments. we determined that purifying selection is acting on both numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in malus.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide evidence that numit rps <dig> genes in rosids have experienced adaptive sequence evolution and convergent evolution with mt rps <dig>  co-expression of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> and purifying selection on both genes in malus suggest that both are functional. the three organellar rps <dig> genes in rosids provide a distinctive case of gene duplication involving the co-evolution of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes.
