BACKGROUND
human herpesvirus  <dig> , the causative agent of kaposi’s sarcoma, induces an intense modification of lipid metabolism and enhances the angiogenic process in endothelial cells. in the present study, neutral lipid  metabolism and angiogenesis were investigated in hhv8-infected huvec cells. the viral replication phases were verified by rtpcr and also by k <dig>  and lana immunostaining.


RESULTS
lipid droplets  were higher in all phases and nl staining  combined with viral-antigen detection  demonstrated a nl content increase in infected cells. in particular, triglyceride synthesis increases in the lytic phase, whereas cholesteryl ester synthesis rises in the latent one. moreover, the inhibition of cholesterol esterification reduces neo-tubule formation mainly in latently infected cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that a reprogramming of cholesteryl ester metabolism is involved in regulating neo-angiogenesis in hhv8-infected cells and plays a likely role in the high metastatic potential of derived-tumours.
