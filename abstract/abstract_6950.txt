BACKGROUND
β-fructofuranosidases  catalyse the commercially-important biotransformation of sucrose into short-chain fructooligosaccharides with wide-scale application as a prebiotic in the functional foods and pharmaceutical industries.


RESULTS
we identified a β-fructofuranosidase gene  from a ceratocystis moniliformis genome sequence using protein homology and phylogenetic analysis. the predicted  <dig> amino acid protein, cminv, grouped with an existing clade within the glycoside hydrolase  family  <dig> and showed typical conserved motifs of this enzyme family. heterologous expression of the cminv gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae by4742∆suc <dig> provided further evidence that cminv indeed functions as a β-fructofuranosidase. firstly, expression of the cminv gene complemented the inability of the ∆suc <dig> deletion mutant strain of s. cerevisiae to grow on sucrose as sole carbohydrate source. secondly, the recombinant protein was capable of producing short-chain fructooligosaccharides  when incubated in the presence of 10% sucrose. purified deglycosylated cminv protein showed a molecular weight of ca. 66 kda and a km and vmax on sucrose of  <dig>  mm and 986 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively. its optimal ph and temperature conditions were determined to be  <dig>  and  <dig> °c, respectively. the addition of 50 mm licl led to a 186% increase in cminv activity. another striking feature was the relatively high volumetric production of this protein in s. cerevisiae as one ml of supernatant was calculated to contain 197 ±  <dig> international units of enzyme.


CONCLUSIONS
the properties of the cminv enzyme make it an attractive alternative to other invertases being used in industry.
