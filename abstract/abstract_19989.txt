BACKGROUND
as the indispensable part of plant, leaf blade mainly functions as the production workshops where organic substance is produced by photosynthesis. leaf colour mutation is a genetic phenomenon that has a high frequency and is easily identified. the mutations always exhibit negative impact on the development of plants in any of the different stages of growth. up to now, numerous genes involved in leaf colour mutations have been cloned.


RESULTS
in this study, a yellow-green leaf mutant, yellow-green leaf  <dig> , with stable genetic phenotype, has been screened out in the progeny of an excellent indica restorer line jinhui  <dig> with seeds treated by ems. the levels of chl a, chl b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in ygl <dig> than those in the wt throughout the whole growth period, while no clear change was noted in the chl a/b ratio. transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the lamellae were clearly intumescent and intricately stacked in ygl <dig>  furthermore, compared with those of the wt, the stomatal conductance, intercellular co <dig> concentration, photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of ylg <dig> were all significantly lower. map-based cloning results showed that loc_os01g <dig>  encoding a chloroplast-targeted ump kinase, corresponded to ygl <dig> and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice . complementation of ygl <dig> with the wt dna sequence of loc_os01g <dig> led to restoration of the normal phenotype, and transgenic rna interference plants showed a yellow-green colour. analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of ygl <dig> indicated that it was highly expressed in leaf blades and weakly expressed in other tissues. qrt-pcr also showed that the expression levels of the major photosystem i core subunits plastome-encoded psaa, psab and psbc were significantly reduced in ygl <dig>  the expression levels of nuclear-encoded gene involved in chl biosynthesis hemc, heme, and pora were also decreased when compared with the wild-type.


CONCLUSIONS
independent of chl biosynthesis and photosystem, ygl <dig> may affect the structure and function of chloroplasts grana lamellae by regulating plastid genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive gene expression and indirectly influences chl biosynthesis.
