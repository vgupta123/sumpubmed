BACKGROUND
systems biology and functional genomics require genome-wide datasets and resources. complete sets of cloned open reading frames  have been made for about a dozen bacterial species and allow researchers to express and study complete proteomes in a high-throughput fashion.


RESULTS
we have constructed an open reading frame  collection of  <dig> or 94% of the known escherichia coli k- <dig> orfs in gatewayÂ® entry vector pentr/zeo. the collection has been used for protein expression and protein interaction studies. for example, we have compared interactions among ygjd, yjee and yeaz proteins in e. coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. we also compare this orfeome with other gateway-compatible bacterial orfeomes and show its utility for comparative functional genomics.


CONCLUSIONS
the e. coli orfeome provides a useful resource for functional genomics and other areas of protein research in a highly flexible format. our comparison with other orfeomes makes comparative analyses straighforward and facilitates direct comparisons of many proteins across many genomes.
