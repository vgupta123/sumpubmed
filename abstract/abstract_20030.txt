BACKGROUND

auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  family genes encode short-lived nuclear proteins that mediate the responses of auxin-related genes and are involved in several plant developmental and growth processes. however, how aux/iaa genes function in the fruit development and ripening of papaya  is largely unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, a comprehensive identification and a distinctive expression analysis of  <dig> c. papaya aux/iaa  genes were performed using newly updated papaya reference genome data. the aux/iaa gene family in papaya is slightly smaller than that in arabidopsis, but all of the phylogenetic subfamilies are represented. most of the cpiaa genes are responsive to various phytohormones and expressed in a tissues-specific manner. to understand the putative biological functions of the cpiaa genes involved in fruit development and ripening, quantitative real-time pcr was used to test the expression profiling of cpiaa genes at different stages. furthermore, an iaa treatment significantly delayed the ripening process in papaya fruit at the early stages. the expression changes of cpiaa genes in acc and 1-mcp treatments suggested a crosstalk between auxin and ethylene during the fruit ripening process of papaya.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provided comprehensive information on the aux/iaa family in papaya, including gene structures, phylogenetic relationships and expression profiles. the involvement of cpiaa gene expression changes in fruit development and ripening gives us an opportunity to understand the roles of auxin signaling in the maturation of papaya reproductive organs.
