BACKGROUND
the genome of the gram-positive, metal-reducing, dehalorespiring desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb- <dig> was sequenced in order to gain insights into its metabolic capacities, adaptive physiology, and regulatory machineries, and to compare with that of desulfitobacterium hafniense y <dig>  the phylogenetically closest strain among the species with a sequenced genome.


RESULTS
the genome of desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb- <dig> is composed of a  <dig> ,134-bp circular chromosome with  <dig>  predicted genes. genome content and parallel physiological studies support the cell's ability to fix n <dig> and co <dig>  form spores and biofilms, reduce metals, and use a variety of electron acceptors in respiration, including halogenated organic compounds. the genome contained seven reductive dehalogenase genes and four nitrogenase gene homologs but lacked the nar respiratory nitrate reductase system. the d. hafniense dcb- <dig> genome contained genes for  <dig> rna polymerase sigma factors including  <dig> sigma- <dig> subunits,  <dig> two-component signal transduction systems, and about  <dig> transporter proteins. in addition, it contained genes for  <dig> molybdopterin-binding oxidoreductases,  <dig> flavoprotein paralogs of the fumarate reductase, and many other fad/fmn-binding oxidoreductases, proving the cell's versatility in both adaptive and reductive capacities. together with the ability to form spores, the presence of the co2-fixing wood-ljungdahl pathway and the genes associated with oxygen tolerance add flexibility to the cell's options for survival under stress.


CONCLUSIONS
d. hafniense dcb-2's genome contains genes consistent with its abilities for dehalogenation, metal reduction, n <dig> and co <dig> fixation, anaerobic respiration, oxygen tolerance, spore formation, and biofilm formation which make this organism a potential candidate for bioremediation at contaminated sites.
