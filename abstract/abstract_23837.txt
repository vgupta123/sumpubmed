BACKGROUND
the goal of information integration in systems biology is to combine information from a number of databases and data sets, which are obtained from both high and low throughput experiments, under one data management scheme such that the cumulative information provides greater biological insight than is possible with individual information sources considered separately.


RESULTS
here we present pathsys, a graph-based system for creating a combined database of networks of interaction for generating integrated view of biological mechanisms. we used pathsys to integrate over  <dig> curated and publicly contributed data sources for the budding yeast  and gene ontology. a number of exploratory questions were formulated as a combination of relational and graph-based queries to the integrated database. thus, pathsys is a general-purpose, scalable, graph-data warehouse of biological information, complete with a graph manipulation and a query language, a storage mechanism and a generic data-importing mechanism through schema-mapping.


CONCLUSIONS
results from several test studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in retrieving biologically interesting relations between genes and proteins, the networks connecting them, and of the utility of pathsys as a scalable graph-based warehouse for interaction-network integration and a hypothesis generator system. the pathsys's client software, named biologicalnetworks, developed for navigation and analyses of molecular networks, is available as a java web start application at .
