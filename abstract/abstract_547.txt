BACKGROUND
the ferm domain containing protein mosaic eyes  interacts with crumbs proteins, which are important regulators of apical identity and size. in zebrafish, loss-of-function mutations in moe result in defects in brain ventricle formation, retinal pigmented epithelium and neural retinal development, pericardial edema, and tail curvature. in humans and mice, there are two major alternately spliced isoforms of the moe orthologue, erythrocyte protein band  <dig> -like  <dig> , which we have named epb <dig> l5long and epb <dig> l5short, that differ after the ferm domain. interestingly, moe and both epb <dig> l <dig> isoforms have a putative c' terminal type-i pdz-binding domain . we previously showed that the n' terminal ferm domain in moe directly mediates interactions with crumbs proteins and nagie oko  in zebrafish, but the function of the c'terminal half of moe/epb <dig> l <dig> has not yet been examined.


RESULTS
to define functionally important domains in zebrafish moe and murine epb <dig> l <dig>  we tested whether injection of mrnas encoding these proteins could rescue defects in zebrafish moe- embryos. injection of either moe or epb <dig> l5long mrna, but not epb <dig> l5short mrna, could rescue moe- embryonic defects. we also tested whether mrna encoding c' terminal truncations of epb <dig> l5long or chimeric constructs with reciprocal swaps of the isoform-specific pbds could rescue moe- defects. we found that injection of the epb <dig> l5short chimera , containing the pbd from epb <dig> l5long, could rescue retinal and rpe defects in moe- mutants, but not brain ventricle formation. injection of the epb <dig> l5long chimera , containing the pbd from epb <dig> l5short, rescued retinal defects, and to a large extent rescued rpe integrity. the only construct that caused a dominant phenotype in wild-type embryos, was epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd, which caused brain ventricle defects and edema that were similar to those observed in moe- mutants. lastly, the morphology of rod photoreceptors in moe- mutants where embryonic defects were rescued by moe or epb <dig> l5long mrna injection is abnormal and their outer segments are larger than normal.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the data reveal tissue specificity for the function of the pbd in epb <dig> l5long, and suggest that additional c' terminal sequences are important for zebrafish retinal development. additionally, our data provide further evidence that moe is a negative regulator of rod outer segment size.
