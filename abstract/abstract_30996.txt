BACKGROUND
recently, hen <dig> protein from arabidopsis thaliana was discovered as an essential enzyme in plant microrna  biogenesis. hen <dig> transfers a methyl group from s-adenosylmethionine to the 2'-oh or 3'-oh group of the last nucleotide of mirna/mirna* duplexes produced by the nuclease dicer. previously it was found that hen <dig> possesses a rossmann-fold methyltransferase  domain and a long n-terminal extension including a putative double-stranded rna-binding motif . however, little is known about the details of the structure and the mechanism of action of this enzyme, and about its phylogenetic origin.


RESULTS
extensive database searches were carried out to identify orthologs and close paralogs of hen <dig>  based on the multiple sequence alignment a phylogenetic tree of the hen <dig> family was constructed. the fold-recognition approach was used to identify related methyltransferases with experimentally solved structures and to guide the homology modeling of the hen <dig> catalytic domain. additionally, we identified a la-like predicted rna binding domain located c-terminally to the dsrm domain and a domain with a peptide prolyl cis/trans isomerase  fold, but without the conserved ppiase active site, located n-terminally to the catalytic domain.


CONCLUSIONS
the bioinformatics analysis revealed that the catalytic domain of hen <dig> is not closely related to any known rna:2'-oh methyltransferases , but rather to small-molecule methyltransferases. the structural model was used as a platform to identify the putative active site and substrate-binding residues of hen and to propose its mechanism of action.
