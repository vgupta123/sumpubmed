BACKGROUND
ubcm <dig> is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with roles in the turnover of damaged and misfolded proteins, cell cycle progression, development, and regulation of the antioxidant transcription factor, nrf <dig>  recent screens have identified binding partners of the enzyme that are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, and our previous studies have shown that ubcm <dig> is enriched in retina and brain.


RESULTS
in the current study, we characterized ubcm <dig> protein expression in various structures and cell types in the murine brain. immunofluorescence analysis of paraffin-embedded brain sections revealed that ubcm <dig> is ubiquitously expressed throughout the brain, is enriched in hindbrain and cortex, and is robustly expressed in neurons. in contrast, the enzyme is undetectable in most astrocytes and microglia. as dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system  has been linked to many age-related neurological diseases, we compared ubcm <dig> expression levels in young versus aged wild-type mice and found a global decrease in expression in aged brains, with reductions of 10 % or greater in five substructures .


CONCLUSIONS
these studies represent the first protein expression profiling of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the brain and support the notion that deficits in protein degradation and proteostasis associated with neurodegenerative diseases may be, in part, attributable to age-dependent reductions in the enzymatic machinery of the ups.
