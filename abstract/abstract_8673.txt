BACKGROUND
a large-scale, highly accurate, machine-understandable drug-disease treatment relationship knowledge base is important for computational approaches to drug repurposing. the large body of published biomedical research articles and clinical case reports available on medline is a rich source of fda-approved drug-disease indication as well as drug-repurposing knowledge that is crucial for applying fda-approved drugs for new diseases. however, much of this information is buried in free text and not captured in any existing databases. the goal of this study is to extract a large number of accurate drug-disease treatment pairs from published literature.


RESULTS
in this study, we developed a simple but highly accurate pattern-learning approach to extract treatment-specific drug-disease pairs from  <dig> million biomedical abstracts available on medline. we extracted a total of  <dig>  unique drug-disease treatment pairs, the majority of which are not included in existing structured databases. our algorithm achieved a precision of  <dig>  and a recall of  <dig>  in extracting all pairs, and a precision of  <dig>  and a recall of  <dig>  in extracting frequent pairs. in addition, we have shown that the extracted pairs strongly correlate with both drug target genes and therapeutic classes, therefore may have high potential in drug discovery.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that our simple pattern-learning relationship extraction algorithm is able to accurately extract many drug-disease pairs from the free text of biomedical literature that are not captured in structured databases. the large-scale, accurate, machine-understandable drug-disease treatment knowledge base that is resultant of our study, in combination with pairs from structured databases, will have high potential in computational drug repurposing tasks.
