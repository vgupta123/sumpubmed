BACKGROUND
the pro-apoptotic protein cc3/tip <dig> has an unusual cellular function as an inhibitor of nucleocytoplasmic transport. this function is likely to be activated under conditions of stress. a number of studies support the notion that cc <dig> acts as a tumor and metastasis suppressor in various types of cancer. the yeast homolog of cc <dig> is likely to be involved in responses to dna damage. here we examined the potential role of cc <dig> in regulation of cellular responses to genotoxic stress.


RESULTS
we found that forced expression of cc <dig> in cc3-negative cells strongly delays the repair of uv-induced dna damage. exogenously introduced cc <dig> negatively affects expression levels of ddb2/xpe and p21cip <dig>  and inhibits induction of c-fos after uv exposure. in addition, exogenous cc <dig> prevents the nuclear accumulation of p21cip in response to uv. these changes in the levels/localization of relevant proteins resulting from the enforced expression of cc <dig> are likely to contribute to the observed delay in dna damage repair. silencing of cc <dig> in cc3-positive cells has a modest delaying effect on repair of the uv induced damage, but has a much more significant negative affect on the translesion dna synthesis after uv exposure. this could be related to the higher expression levels and increased nuclear localization of p21cip <dig> in cells where expression of cc <dig> is silenced. expression of cc <dig> also inhibits repair of oxidative dna damage and leads to a decrease in levels of nucleoredoxin, that could contribute to the reduced viability of cc <dig> expressing cells after oxidative insult.


CONCLUSIONS
manipulation of the cellular levels of cc <dig> alters expression levels and/or subcellular localization of proteins that exhibit nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. this results in altered responses to genotoxic stress and adversely affects dna damage repair by affecting the recruitment of adequate amounts of required proteins to proper cellular compartments. excess of cellular cc <dig> has a significant negative effect on dna repair after uv and oxidant exposure, while silencing of endogenous cc <dig> slightly delays repair of uv-induced damage.
