BACKGROUND
the pistillody mutant wheat  plant hts- <dig> exhibits homeotic transformation of stamens into pistils or pistil-like structures. unlike common wheat varieties, hts- <dig> produces three to six pistils per floret, potentially increasing the yield. thus, hts- <dig> is highly valuable in the study of floral development in wheat. in this study, we conducted rna sequencing of the transcriptomes of the pistillody stamen  and the pistil  from hts- <dig> plants, and the stamen  from the non-pistillody control variety chinese spring tp to gain insights into pistil and stamen development in wheat.


RESULTS
approximately  <dig> gb of processed reads were obtained from ps, p, and s. de novo assembly yielded  <dig>  putative unigenes, with a mean length of 695 bp. among these high-quality unigenes,  <dig>   had at least one significant match with an existing gene model. a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified in ps vs. p, ps vs. s, and p vs. s, respectively, with differences in expression greater than five-fold. among the differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were highly correlated with stamen and pistil development. these genes include wm27b, dl, yab <dig>  yabby <dig>  wm  <dig>  cer  <dig>  and wblh <dig>  which have been implicated in flower development. the expression patterns of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were confirmed through quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of this transcriptome resource enabled us to characterize gene expression profiles, examine differential gene expression, and produce a candidate gene list related to wheat stamen and pistil development. this work is significant for the development of genomic resources for wheat, and provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms of wheat stamen and pistil development.
