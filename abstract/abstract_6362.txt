BACKGROUND
understanding the epidemiology of foot-and-mouth disease , including roles played by different hosts, is essential for improving disease control. the african buffalo  is a reservoir for the sat serotypes of fmd virus . large buffalo populations commonly intermingle with livestock in kenya, yet earlier studies have focused on fmd in the domestic livestock, hence the contribution of buffalo to disease in livestock is largely unknown. this study analysed  <dig> epithelia collected from fmd outbreaks in kenyan cattle between  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> probang and serum samples collected from buffalo in three different kenyan ecosystems; maasai-mara  , tsavo  , and meru  .


RESULTS
antibodies against fmdv non-structural proteins were found in  <dig> of  <dig>  sera from buffalo with 44/ <dig> and 53/ <dig> also having neutralising antibodies directed against fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  respectively. fmdv rna was detected in 42% of the buffalo probang samples by rt-qpcr  ≤32). two buffalo probang samples were positive by vi and were identified as fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> by ag-elisa, while the latter assay detected serotypes o , a , sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  in the  <dig> cattle epithelia. vp <dig> coding sequences were generated for two buffalo and  <dig> cattle samples. phylogenetic analyses revealed sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> virus lineages within buffalo that were distinct from those detected in cattle.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that fmdv serotypes o, a, sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> were circulating among cattle in kenya and cause disease, but only sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> viruses were successfully isolated from clinically normal buffalo. the buffalo isolates were genetically distinct from isolates obtained from cattle. control efforts should focus primarily on reducing fmdv circulation among livestock and limiting interaction with buffalo. comprehensive studies incorporating additional buffalo viruses are recommended.
