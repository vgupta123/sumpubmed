BACKGROUND
aeromonas salmonicida has been isolated from numerous fish species and shows wide variation in virulence and pathogenicity. as part of a larger research program to identify virulence genes and candidates for vaccine development, a dna microarray was constructed using a subset of  <dig> genes from the draft genome sequence of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strain a <dig>  the microarray included genes encoding known virulence-associated factors in a. salmonicida and homologs of virulence genes of other pathogens. we used microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations  to compare selected a. salmonicida sub-species and other aeromonas species from different hosts and geographic locations.


RESULTS
results showed variable carriage of virulence-associated genes and generally increased variation in gene content across sub-species and species boundaries. the greatest variation was observed among genes associated with plasmids and transposons. there was little correlation between geographic region and degree of variation for all isolates tested.


CONCLUSIONS
we have used the m-cgh technique to identify subsets of conserved genes from amongst this set of a. salmonicida virulence genes for further investigation as potential vaccine candidates. unlike other bacterial characterization methods that use a small number of gene or dna-based functions, m-cgh examines thousands of genes and/or whole genomes and thus is a more comprehensive analytical tool for veterinary or even human health research.
