BACKGROUND
the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea remains a public health concern for becoming resistant to drug treatments available. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry  to identify and cluster neisseria gonorrhoeae.

from a current monitoring in italy, as part of the european gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance programme ,  <dig> gonococci collected from  <dig> to  <dig> susceptible  and resistant  to cefixime were selected. minimum inhibitory concentration  values for cefixime was assessed by etest carried out in agreement with the manufacturer’s instructions and interpreted referring to european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing  clinical breakpoints criteria. data obtained by n. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing  and the dendrogram based on the concatenation of porb and tbpb genes were evaluated. maldi-tof ms, to reconfirm gonorrhea identification, analyzed single colonies from freshly grown isolates and applied directly on a ground-steel maldi target plate. for the maldi-tof dendrogram cluster analysis, msps  from each isolate were created acquiring  <dig> shots from  <dig> technical replicates obtained from bacteria extraction.


RESULTS
molecular typing by ng-mast showed  <dig> sequence types ; g <dig> was the predominant accounting for  <dig> gonococci. all the  <dig> gonococci, except one, were correctly identified at species level by maldi-tof ms and g <dig> isolates were divided into two clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
maldi-tof ms for a real-time detection and cluster analysis of gonorrhea is a promising tool for surveillance purposes. moreover, additional studies are required to collect more data on the performance of maldi-tof ms for gonococci.
