BACKGROUND
many in vitro studies have shown that adenosine  can induce vascular endothelial growth factor  mrna and protein expression and stimulate endothelial proliferation. in the present study, we seek to determine whether ado can increase circulating levels of vegf protein in the intact human.

methods
five outpatients  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years of age and weighing  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg were selected. they were given a  <dig> min intravenous infusion of ado  in conjunction with sestamibi myocardial perfusion scans. mean blood pressure  and heart rate  were determined before ado infusion and every  <dig> min for the next  <dig> min. plasma vegf concentrations  were determined immediately before ado infusion and  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after the infusion.


RESULTS
plasma vegf concentration averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg ml- <dig> prior to ado infusion, and increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg ml- <dig> at  <dig> h post- infusion . vegf plasma concentration returned to basal levels  <dig> h after infusion . mbp averaged  <dig> ±  <dig> mmhg and heart rate averaged  <dig> ±  <dig> prior to ado infusion. mbp decreased by a maximum of ~22% and hr increased by a maximum of ~17% during the infusion.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude from these preliminary findings that intravenous infusion of adenosine can increase plasma levels of vegf in humans.
