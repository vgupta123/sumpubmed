BACKGROUND
chick definitive endoderm is an important source of signals that pattern the early embryo forming a central structure around which the body plan is constructed. although the origin of definitive endoderm has been mapped in the chick, arising principally from rostral streak at elongating streak stages, it is not known when this layer first becomes fully committed to its germ layer fate, an important issue to resolve in light of its critical role in subsequent patterning of the early embryo.


RESULTS
through gene expression screening of chick gastrula, we identified molecular markers of definitive endoderm restricted to rostral  and caudal  regions, suggesting that at least two subpopulations of definitive endodermal cells exist during ingression. we show  that presumptive mesoderm cells migrate to the middle layer and remain mesenchymal when transplanted to rostral primitive streak, and prospective endoderm cells enter the lower layer and become epithelial when transplanted to caudal primitive streak; and  that presumptive endoderm cells and mesoderm cells lose normal gene expression  when transplanted outside of their normal position of origin. moreover, when rostral or caudal primitive streak segments are transplanted into rostral blastoderm isolates , both types of transplants express sox <dig> 4– <dig> hours later–consistent with their new position, regardless of their presumptive germ layer origin–and prospective mesoderm transplants, which normally express wnt8c, turn off expression, suggesting that signals within the rostral blastoderm induce endoderm gene expression, and repress mesoderm gene expression, during gastrulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that germ layer identity is fixed at the time populations of endoderm and mesoderm cells ingress through the primitive streak, whereas their gene expression patterns remain labile. in addition, our results show that inductive and repressive signals are present, and that these signals regulate gene expression of both ingressed endoderm and mesoderm cells. thus, gastrula cells display elements of both pre-patterning and plasticity, with endoderm the first germ layer becoming committed to its fate during early gastrulation stages.
