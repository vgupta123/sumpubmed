BACKGROUND
the early events underlying alzheimer's disease  remain uncertain, although environmental factors may be involved. work in this laboratory has shown that the combination of herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  in brain and carriage of the apoe-ε <dig> allele of the apoe gene strongly increases the risk of developing ad. the development of ad is thought to involve abnormal aggregation or deposition of a 39– <dig> amino acid protein – β amyloid  – within the brain. this is cleaved from the much larger transmembranal protein 'amyloid precursor protein' . any agent able to interfere directly with aβ or app metabolism may therefore have the capacity to contribute towards ad. one recent report showed that certain hsv <dig> glycoprotein peptides may aggregate like aβ; a second study described a role for app in transport of virus in squid axons. however to date the effects of acute herpesvirus infection on metabolism of app in human neuronal-type cells have not been investigated. in order to find if hsv <dig> directly affects app and its degradation, we have examined this protein from human neuroblastoma cells  infected with the virus, using western blotting.


RESULTS
we have found that acute hsv <dig>  infection rapidly reduces full length app levels – as might be expected – yet surprisingly markedly increases levels of a novel c-terminal fragment of app of about  <dig> kda. this band was not increased in cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide


CONCLUSIONS
herpes virus infection leads to rapid loss of full length app from cells, yet also causes increased levels of a novel  <dig> kda c-terminal app fragment. these data suggest that infection can directly alter the processing of a transmembranal protein intimately linked to the aetiology of ad.
