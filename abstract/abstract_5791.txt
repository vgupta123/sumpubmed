BACKGROUND
the development of teeth is the result of interactions between competent mesenchyme and epithelium, both of which undergo extensive morphogenesis. the importance of cell adhesion molecules in morphogenesis has long been acknowledged but remarkably few studies have focused on the distribution and function of these molecules in tooth development.


RESULTS
we analyzed the expression pattern of an important epithelial cadherin, e-cadherin, during the formation of first-generation teeth as well as replacement teeth in the zebrafish, using in situ hybridization and whole mount immunostaining to reveal mrna expression and protein distribution. e-cadherin was detected in every layer of the enamel organ during the different stages of tooth development, but there were slight differences between first-generation and replacement teeth in the strength and distribution of the signal. the dental papilla, which is derived from the mesenchyme, did not show any expression. remarkably, the crypts surrounding the functional teeth showed an uneven distribution of e-cadherin throughout the pharyngeal region.


CONCLUSIONS
the slight differences between e-cadherin expression in zebrafish teeth and developing mouse and human teeth are discussed in the light of fundamental differences in structural and developmental features of the dentition between zebrafish and mammals. importantly, the uninterrupted expression of e-cadherin indicates that down-regulation of e-cadherin is not required for formation of an epithelial tooth bud. further research is needed to understand the role of other cell adhesion systems during the development of teeth and the formation of replacement teeth.
