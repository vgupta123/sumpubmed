BACKGROUND
on a single strand of genomic dna the number of as is usually about equal to the number of ts , but deviations have been noted for transcribed regions and origins of replication.


RESULTS
the mouse genome is shown to have a segmented structure defined by strand bias. transcription is known to cause a strand bias and numerous analyses are presented to show that the strand bias in question is not caused by transcription. however, these strand bias segments influence the position of genes and their unspliced length. the position of genes within the strand bias structure affects the probability that a gene is switched on and its expression level. transcription has a highly directional flow within this structure and the peak volume of transcription is around  <dig> kb from the a-rich/t-rich segment boundary on the t-rich side, directed away from the boundary. the a-rich/t-rich boundaries are satb <dig> binding regions, whereas the t-rich/a-rich boundary regions are not.


CONCLUSIONS
the direct cause of the strand bias structure may be dna replication. the strand bias segments represent a further biological feature, the chromatin structure, which in turn influences the ease of transcription.
