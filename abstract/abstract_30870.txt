BACKGROUND
the phytohormone ethylene  is a key signaling molecule for inducing the biosynthesis of shikonin and its derivatives, which are secondary metabolites in lithospermum erythrorhizon. although ethylene insensitive <dig> /ein3-like proteins  are crucial transcription factors in et signal transduction pathway, the possible function of ein3/eil <dig> in shikonin biosynthesis remains unknown. in this study, by targeting leeil- <dig>  at the expression level, we revealed the positive regulatory effect of leeil- <dig> on shikonin formation.


RESULTS
the mrna level of leeil- <dig> was significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in the leeil-1-overexpressing hairy root lines and leeil-1-rnai hairy root lines, respectively. specifically, leeil- <dig> overexpression resulted in increased transcript levels of the downstream gene of et signal transduction pathway  and a subset of genes for shikonin formation, excretion and/or transportation , which was consistent with the enhanced shikonin contents in the leeil-1-overexpressing hairy root lines. conversely, leeil-1-rnai dramatically repressed the expression of the above genes and significantly reduced shikonin production.


CONCLUSIONS
the results revealed that leeil- <dig> is a positive regulator of the biosynthesis of shikonin and its derivatives in l. erythrorhizon hairy roots. our findings gave new insights into the molecular regulatory mechanism of et in shikonin biosynthesis. leeil- <dig> could be a crucial target gene for the genetic engineering of shikonin biosynthesis.
