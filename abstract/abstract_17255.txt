BACKGROUND
in neutralophilic bacteria, monovalent metal cation/h+ antiporters play a key role in ph homeostasis. in escherichia coli, only four antiporters  are identified to function in maintenance of a stable cytoplasmic ph under conditions of alkaline stress. we hypothesised that the multidrug resistance protein mdtm, a recently characterised homologue of mdfa and a member of the major facilitator superfamily, also functions in alkaline ph homeostasis.


RESULTS
assays that compared the growth of an e. coli Î”mdtm deletion mutant transformed with a plasmid encoding wild-type mdtm or the dysfunctional mdtm d22a mutant at different external alkaline ph values  revealed a potential contribution by mdtm to alkaline ph tolerance, but only when millimolar concentrations of sodium or potassium was present in the growth medium. fluorescence-based activity assays using inverted vesicles generated from transformants of antiporter-deficient  e. coli to <dig> cells defined mdtm as a low-affinity antiporter that catalysed electrogenic exchange of na+, k+, rb+ or li+ for h+. the k+/h+ antiport reaction had a ph optimum at  <dig> , whereas the na+/h+ exchange activity was optimum at ph  <dig> . measurement of internal cellular ph confirmed mdtm as contributing to maintenance of a stable cytoplasmic ph, acid relative to the external ph, under conditions of alkaline stress.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the results support a role for mdtm in alkaline ph tolerance. mdtm can therefore be added to the currently limited list of antiporters known to function in ph homeostasis in the model organism e. coli.
