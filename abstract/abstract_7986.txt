BACKGROUND
cyclopropane fatty acids  have been found in certain gymnosperms, malvales, litchi and other sapindales. the presence of their unique strained ring structures confers physical and chemical properties characteristic of unsaturated fatty acids with the oxidative stability displayed by saturated fatty acids making them of considerable industrial interest. while cyclopropenoid fatty acids  are well-known inhibitors of fatty acid desaturation in animals, cpe can also inhibit the stearoyl-coa desaturase and interfere with the maturation and reproduction of some insect species suggesting that in addition to their traditional role as storage lipids, cpe can contribute to the protection of plants from herbivory.


RESULTS
three genes encoding cyclopropane synthase homologues ghcps <dig>  ghcps <dig> and ghcps <dig> were identified in cotton. determination of gene transcript abundance revealed differences among the expression of ghcps <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showing high, intermediate and low levels, respectively, of transcripts in roots and stems; whereas ghcps <dig> and  <dig> are both expressed at low levels in seeds. analyses of fatty acid composition in different tissues indicate that the expression patterns of ghcps <dig> and  <dig> correlate with cyclic fatty acid  distribution. deletion of the n-terminal oxidase domain lowered ghcps's ability to produce cyclopropane fatty acid by approximately 70%. ghcps <dig> and  <dig>  but not  <dig> resulted in the production of cyclopropane fatty acids upon heterologous expression in yeast, tobacco by <dig> cell and arabidopsis seed.


CONCLUSIONS
in cotton ghcps <dig> and  <dig> gene expression correlates with the total cfa content in roots, stems and seeds. that ghcps <dig> and  <dig> are expressed at a similar level in seed suggests both of them can be considered potential targets for gene silencing to reduce undesirable seed cpe accumulation. because ghcps <dig> is more active in yeast than the published sterculia cps and shows similar activity when expressed in model plant systems, it represents a strong candidate gene for cfa accumulation via heterologous expression in production plants.
