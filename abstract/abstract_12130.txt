BACKGROUND
the grooved carpet shell clam ruditapes decussatus is the autochthonous european clam and the most appreciated from a gastronomic and economic point of view. the production is in decline due to several factors such as perkinsiosis and habitat invasion and competition by the introduced exotic species, the manila clam ruditapes philippinarum. after we sequenced r. decussatus transcriptome we have designed an oligo microarray capable of contributing to provide some clues on molecular response of the clam to perkinsiosis.


RESULTS
a database consisting of  <dig>  unique transcripts was constructed, of which  <dig>   were annotated by similarity. an oligo-dna microarray platform was then designed and applied to profile gene expression in r. decussatus heavily infected by perkinsus olseni. functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between those two conditionswas performed by gene set enrichment analysis. as expected, microarrays unveil genes related with stress/infectious agents such as hydrolases, proteases and others. the extensive role of innate immune system was also analyzed and effect of parasitosis upon expression of important molecules such as lectins reviewed.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents a first attempt to characterize ruditapes decussatus transcriptome, an important marine resource for the european aquaculture. the trancriptome sequencing and consequent annotation will increase the available tools and resources for this specie, introducing the possibility of high throughput experiments such as microarrays analysis. in this specific case microarray approach was used to unveil some important aspects of host-parasite interaction between the carpet shell clam and perkinsus, two non-model species, highlighting some genes associated with this interaction. ample information was obtained to identify biological processes significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes in perkinsus infected versus non-infected gills. an overview on the genes related with the immune system on r. decussatus transcriptome is also reported.
