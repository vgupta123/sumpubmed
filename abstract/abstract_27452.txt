BACKGROUND
eukaryotic elongation factor  <dig> alpha  is one of the four subunits composing eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig>  it catalyzes the binding of aminoacyl-trna to the a-site of the ribosome in a gtp-dependent manner during protein synthesis, although it also seems to play a role in other non-translational processes. currently, little information is still available about its expression profile and regulation during flatfish metamorphosis. with regard to this, senegalese sole  is a commercially important flatfish in which eef1a gene remains to be characterized.


RESULTS
the development of large-scale genomics of senegalese sole has facilitated the identification of five different eef1a genes, referred to as sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  and sse42sp <dig>  main characteristics and sequence identities with other fish and mammalian eef1as are described. phylogenetic and tissue expression analyses allowed for the identification of sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> as the senegalese sole counterparts of mammalian eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig>  respectively, and of sse42sp <dig> as the ortholog of xenopus laevis and teleost 42sp <dig> gene. the other two elongation factors, sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig>  represent novel genes that are mainly expressed in gills and skin. the expression profile of the five genes was also studied during larval development, revealing different behaviours. to study the possible regulation of sseef1a gene expressions by thyroid hormones , larvae were exposed to the goitrogen thiourea . tu-treated larvae exhibited lower sseef1a <dig> mrna levels than untreated controls at both  <dig> and  <dig> days after treatment, whereas transcripts of the other four genes remained relatively unchanged. moreover, addition of exogenous t <dig> hormone to tu-treated larvae increased significantly the steady-state levels of sseef1a <dig> with respect to untreated controls, demonstrating that its expression is up-regulated by ths.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified five different eef1a genes in the senegalese sole, referred to as sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  and sse42sp <dig>  the five genes exhibit different expression patterns in tissues and during larval development. tu and t <dig> treatments demonstrate that sseef1a <dig> is up-regulated by ths, suggesting a role in the translational regulation of the factors involved in the dramatic changes that occurs during senegalese sole metamorphosis.
