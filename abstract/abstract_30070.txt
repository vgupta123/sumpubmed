BACKGROUND
although more than one thousand complete mitochondrial dna  sequences have been determined in teleostean fishes, only a few gene rearrangements have been observed, and genome-scale rearrangements are even rarer. however, flatfishes  have been identified as having diverse types of mitochondrial gene rearrangements. it has been reported that tongue soles and the blue flounder mitogenomes exhibit different types of large-scale gene rearrangements.


RESULTS
in the present study, the complete mitochondrial genome of another flatfish, samariscus latus, was sequenced, and genome-scale rearrangements were observed. the genomic features of this flounder are different from those of any other studied vertebrates, including flatfish species too. the mitogenome of s. latus is characterized by the duplication and translocation of the control region . the genes located between the two crs are divided into two clusters in which their relative orders are maintained.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a “double replications and random loss” model to explain the rearrangement events in s. latus mitogenome. this model consists of the following steps. first, the cr was duplicated and translocated. subsequently, double replications of the mitogenome were successively initiated from the two crs, leading to the duplication of the genes between the two crs. finally, one of each pair of duplicated genes was lost in a random event.
