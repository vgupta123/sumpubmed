BACKGROUND
growth/differentiation factor  <dig>  and gdf <dig> are two highly similar members of the transforming growth factor β  family. while gdf <dig> has been recognized as a negative regulator of muscle growth and differentiation, there are conflicting studies on the function of gdf <dig> and whether gdf <dig> has beneficial effects on age-related dysfunction. to address whether gdf <dig> and gdf <dig> are functionally identical, we compared their signaling and structural properties.


RESULTS
here we show that, despite their high similarity, gdf <dig> is a more potent activator of smad2/ <dig> and signals more effectively through the type i activin-like receptor kinase receptors alk4/5/ <dig> than gdf <dig>  resolution of the gdf11:fs <dig> complex, apo-gdf <dig>  and apo-gdf <dig> crystal structures reveals unique properties of both ligands, specifically in the type i receptor binding site. lastly, substitution of gdf <dig> residues into gdf <dig> confers enhanced activity to gdf <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these studies identify distinctive structural features of gdf <dig> that enhance its potency, relative to gdf8; however, the biological consequences of these differences remain to be determined.
