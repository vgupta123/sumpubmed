BACKGROUND
recent theoretical and empirical work has identified redundancy as one of the benefits of the reticulate form in the evolution of leaf vein networks. however, we know little about the costs of redundancy or how those costs depend on vein network geometry or topology. here, we examined both costs and benefits to redundancy in  <dig> individual reticulate leaf networks comprising over  <dig>  million vein segments. we compared levels of costs and benefits within reticulate networks to those within analogous networks without loops known as maximum spanning trees .


RESULTS
we show that network robustness to varying degrees of simulated damage is positively correlated with structural indices of redundancy. we further show that leaf vein networks are topologically, geometrically and functionally more redundant than are msts. however, increased redundancy comes with minor costs in terms of increases in material allocation or decreases in conductance. we also show that full networks do not markedly decrease the distance to non-vein tissue in comparison to msts.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest the evolutionary transition to the reticulate type of networks found in modern angiosperm flora involved a relatively minor increase in material and conductance costs with significant benefits in terms of network redundancy.
