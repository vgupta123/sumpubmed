BACKGROUND
coevolution between pairs of different kind of entities, such as providers and users of information, involves reciprocal selection pressures between them as a consequence of their ecological interaction. pied flycatchers  have been shown to derive fitness benefits  when nesting in proximity to great tits , presumably because they this way discover and obtain information about nesting sites. tits suffer from the resulting association . an arms race between the tits  and the flycatchers  could thus result. great tits often cover eggs with nesting material before, but not during incubation. we hypothesized that one function of egg-covering could be a counter-adaptation to reduce information parasitism by pied flycatchers. we predicted that tits should bring more new hair to cover their exposed eggs when a pied flycatcher is present near to tit nest than when a neutral  species is present. we conducted decoy and playback experiment in oulu and turku, finland. first, we removed and collected all the hair covering the tit eggs. then, we measured how the perceived presence of flycatcher or waxwing  affects tits' egg-covering by collecting and weighing the hair brought on the eggs and photographing the nest 24Â h after the playback.


RESULTS
tits brought more hair into the nest and covered the eggs more carefully after flycatcher treatment, compared to waxwing treatment. we also found that the tits in oulu  had more hair on the top of their eggs in general.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these results suggest that the counter-adaptation function of egg-covering against information parasites may be an extension of original function to protect eggs from low temperatures.
