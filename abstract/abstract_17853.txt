BACKGROUND
huanglongbing  is a highly destructive disease of citrus production worldwide. 'candidatus liberibacter asiaticus', an unculturable alpha proteobacterium, is a putative pathogen of hlb. information about the biology and strain diversity of 'ca. l. asiaticus' is currently limited, inhibiting the scope of hlb research and control.


RESULTS
a genomic region  of 'ca. l. asiaticus' showing hyper-sequence variation or locus mosaicism was identified and investigated using  <dig> bacterial strains . based on the characteristic electrophoretic profiles of pcr amplicons generated by a specific primer set, eight electrophoretic types  were identified, six e-types  in china and four e-types  in florida. the 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from china consisted predominately of e-type a  and e-type b . in contrast, the 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from florida was predominated by e-type g . diversity of 'ca. l. asiaticus' in china was also evidenced. strains from the high altitude yunnan province consisted of five e-types with e-type b being the majority , whereas strains from the low altitude coastal guangdong province consisted of only two e-types with e-type a as the majority . sequence analyses revealed that variation of dna amplicons was due to insertion/deletion events at clibasia_ <dig> and the downstream intergenic region.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated the genomic mosaicism of 'ca. l. asiaticus' resulted from active dna insertion/deletion activities. analyses of strain variation depicted the significant inter- and intra-continent diversity of 'ca. l. asiaticus'.
