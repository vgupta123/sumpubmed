BACKGROUND
dna capture technologies combined with high-throughput sequencing now enable cost-effective, deep-coverage, targeted sequencing of complete exomes. this is well suited for snp discovery and genotyping. however there has been little attention devoted to copy number variation  detection from exome capture datasets despite the potentially high impact of cnvs in exonic regions on protein function.


RESULTS
as members of the  <dig> genomes project analysis effort, we investigated  <dig> samples in which  <dig> genes were targeted and sampled with  <dig> or illumina paired-end sequencing. we developed a rigorous bayesian method to detect cnvs in the genes, based on read depth within target regions. despite substantial variability in read coverage across samples and targeted exons, we were able to identify  <dig> heterozygous deletions in the dataset. the experimentally determined false discovery rate  of the cleanest dataset from the wellcome trust sanger institute is  <dig> %. we were able to substantially improve the fdr in a subset of gene deletion candidates that were adjacent to another gene deletion call . the estimated sensitivity of our call-set was 45%.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that exonic sequencing datasets, collected both in population based and medical sequencing projects, will be a useful substrate for detecting genic cnv events, particularly deletions. based on the number of events we found and the sensitivity of the methods in the present dataset, we estimate on average  <dig> genic heterozygous deletions per individual genome. our power analysis informs ongoing and future projects about sequencing depth and uniformity of read coverage required for efficient detection.
