BACKGROUND
the recently sequenced genome of lactobacillus helveticus dpc <dig>  <cit>  revealed a dairy organism with significant homology  to a probiotic bacteria lb. acidophilus ncfm  <cit> . this led us to hypothesise that a group of genes could be determined which could define an organism's niche.


RESULTS
taking  <dig> fully sequenced lactic acid bacteria  as our target, , we demonstrated that the presence or absence of certain genes involved in sugar metabolism, the proteolytic system, and restriction modification enzymes were pivotal in suggesting the niche of a strain. we identified  <dig> niche specific genes, of which  <dig> are dairy specific and  <dig> are gut specific. the dairy specific genes identified in lactobacillus helveticus dpc <dig> were lhv_ <dig> and lhv_ <dig>  encoding components of the proteolytic system, lhv_ <dig> lhv_ <dig>  lhv_ <dig> and lhv_ <dig> encoding restriction endonuclease genes, while bile salt hydrolase genes lba_ <dig> and lba_ <dig>  and the sugar metabolism gene lba_ <dig> from lb. acidophilus ncfm were identified as gut specific genes.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis revealed that if an organism had homologs to the dairy specific geneset, it probably came from a dairy environment, whilst if it had homologs to gut specific genes, it was highly likely to be of intestinal origin.

we propose that this "barcode" of  <dig> genes will be a useful initial guide to researchers in the lab field to indicate an organism's ability to occupy a specific niche.
