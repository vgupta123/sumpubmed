BACKGROUND
oil palm  is the most important source of edible oil. the improvement of oil yield is currently slow in conventional breeding programs due to long generation intervals. marker-assisted selection  has the potential to accelerate genetic improvement. to identify dna markers associated with oil content traits for mas, we performed quantitative trait loci  mapping using genotyping by sequencing  in a breeding population derived from a cross between deli dura and ghana pisifera, containing 153 f <dig> trees.


RESULTS
we constructed a high-density linkage map containing  <dig> snps and  <dig> microsatellites. the  <dig> linkage groups  spanned 1527 cm, with an average marker space of  <dig>  cm. one significant and three suggestive qtl for oil to bunch  and oil to dry mesocarp  were mapped on lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg <dig> in a f <dig> breeding population, respectively. these qtl explained  <dig> – <dig> % of phenotypic variance. dna markers associated with oil content in these qtl were identified. trees with beneficial genotypes at two qtl for o/b showed an average o/b of  <dig> %, significantly  higher than that of trees without any beneficial qtl genotypes . qtl combinations showed that the higher the number of qtl with beneficial genotypes, the higher the resulting average o/b in the breeding population.


CONCLUSIONS
a linkage map with  <dig> dna markers was constructed and used to identify qtl for oil content traits. pyramiding the identified qtl with beneficial genotypes associated with oil content traits using dna markers has the potential to accelerate genetic improvement for oil yield in the breeding population of oil palm.
