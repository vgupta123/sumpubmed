BACKGROUND
novel immune-type receptor  genes are members of diversified multigene families that are found in bony fish and encode type i transmembrane proteins containing one or two extracellular immunoglobulin  domains. the majority of nitrs can be classified as inhibitory receptors that possess cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs . a much smaller number of nitrs can be classified as activating receptors by the lack of cytoplasmic itims and presence of a positively charged residue within their transmembrane domain, which permits partnering with an activating adaptor protein.


RESULTS
forty-four nitr genes in medaka  are located in three gene clusters on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and can be organized into  <dig> families including inhibitory and activating forms. the particularly large dataset acquired in medaka makes direct comparison possible to another complete dataset acquired in zebrafish in which nitrs are localized in two clusters on different chromosomes. the two largest medaka nitr gene clusters share conserved synteny with the two zebrafish nitr gene clusters. shared synteny between nitrs and cd8a/cd8b is limited but consistent with a potential common ancestry.


CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive phylogenetic analyses between the complete datasets of nitrs from medaka and zebrafish indicate multiple species-specific expansions of different families of nitrs. the patterns of sequence variation among gene family members are consistent with recent birth-and-death events. similar effects have been observed with mammalian immunoglobulin , t cell antigen receptor  and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor  genes. nitrs likely diverged along an independent pathway from that of the somatically rearranging antigen binding receptors but have undergone parallel evolution of v family diversity.
