BACKGROUND
wine aroma results from the combination of numerous volatile compounds, some produced by yeast and others produced in the grapes and further metabolized by yeast. however, little is known about the consequences of the genetic variation of yeast on the production of these volatile metabolites, or on the metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism of grape compounds. as a tool to decipher how wine aroma develops, we analyzed, under two experimental conditions, the production of  <dig> compounds by a population of  <dig> segregants from a cross between a laboratory strain and an industrial strain genotyped at high density.


RESULTS
we detected eight genomic regions explaining the diversity concerning  <dig> compounds, some produced de novo by yeast, such as nerolidol, ethyl esters and phenyl ethanol, and others derived from grape compounds such as citronellol, and cis-rose oxide. in three of these eight regions, we identified genes involved in the phenotype. hemizygote comparison allowed the attribution of differences in the production of nerolidol and 2-phenyl ethanol to the pdr <dig> and abz <dig> genes, respectively. deletion of a plb <dig> gene confirmed its involvement in the production of ethyl esters. a comparison of allelic variants of pdr <dig> and abz <dig> in a set of available sequences revealed that both genes present a higher than expected number of non-synonymous mutations indicating possible balancing selection.


CONCLUSIONS
this study illustrates the value of qtl analysis for the analysis of metabolic traits, and in particular the production of wine aromas. it also identifies the particular role of the pdr <dig> gene in the production of farnesyldiphosphate derivatives, of abz <dig> in the production of numerous compounds and of plb <dig> in ethyl ester synthesis. this work also provides a basis for elucidating the metabolism of various grape compounds, such as citronellol and cis-rose oxide.
