BACKGROUND
rna metabolism, through 'combinatorial splicing', can generate enormous structural diversity in the proteome. alternative domains may interact, however, with unpredictable phenotypic consequences, necessitating integrated rna-level regulation of molecular composition. splicing correlations within transcripts of single genes provide valuable clues to functional relationships among molecular domains as well as genomic targets for higher-order splicing regulation.


RESULTS
we present tools to visualize complex splicing patterns in full-length cdna libraries. developmental changes in pair-wise correlations are presented vectorially in 'clock plots' and linkage grids. higher-order correlations are assessed statistically through monte carlo analysis of a log-linear model with an empirical-bayes estimate of the true probabilities of observed and unobserved splice forms. log-linear coefficients are visualized in a 'spliceprint,' a signature of splice correlations in the transcriptome. we present two novel metrics: the linkage change index, which measures the directional change in pair-wise correlation with tissue differentiation, and the accuracy index, a very simple goodness-of-fit metric that is more sensitive than the integrated squared error when applied to sparsely populated tables, and unlike chi-square, does not diverge at low variance. considerable attention is given to sparse contingency tables, which are inherent to single-gene libraries.


CONCLUSIONS
patterns of splicing correlations are revealed, which span a broad range of interaction order and change in development. the methods have a broad scope of applicability, beyond the single gene â€“ including, for example, multiple gene interactions in the complete transcriptome.
