BACKGROUND
late blight is the most serious potato disease world-wide. the most effective and environmentally sound way for controlling late blight is to incorporate natural resistance into potato cultivars. several late blight resistance genes have been cloned recently. however, there is almost no information available about the resistance pathways mediated by any of those genes.


RESULTS
we previously cloned a late blight resistance gene, rb, from a diploid wild potato species solanum bulbocastanum. transgenic potato lines containing a single rb gene showed a rate-limiting resistance against all known races of phytophthora infestans, the late blight pathogen. to better understand the rb-mediated resistance we silenced the potato rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes that have been implicated in mediating disease resistance responses against various plant pathogens and pests. the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes of a rb-containing potato clone were silenced using a rna interference -based approach. all of the silenced potato plants displayed phenotypically normal growth. the late blight resistance of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> silenced lines were evaluated by a traditional greenhouse inoculation method and quantified using a gfp-tagged p. infestans strain. the resistance of the rar1-silenced plants was not affected. however, silencing of the sgt <dig> gene abolished the rb-mediated resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that silencing of the sgt <dig> gene in potato does not result in lethality. however, the sgt <dig> gene is essential for the rb-mediated late blight resistance. in contrast, the rar <dig> gene is not required for rb-mediated resistance. these results provide additional evidence for the universal role of the sgt <dig> gene in various r gene-mediated plant defense responses.
