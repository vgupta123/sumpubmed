BACKGROUND
the reindeer  industry in alaska began with animals imported from siberia  in the 1890's. cervid herpes virus  <dig>  is endemic in reindeer in scandinavia. we sought to determine if the same virus, or similar herpesviruses, were circulating in alaskan reindeer and caribou . serum samples from  <dig> reindeer were collected during annual reindeer handlings  near nome, alaska. in  <dig>  swab samples were collected from  <dig> calves from this herd, near nome, alaska. in  <dig>  ocular and nasal swab samples were collected from  <dig> apparently healthy reindeer calves near wales, alaska. samples of plasma and white blood cells were collected from three alaskan caribou herds, mulchatna , teshekpuk  and the western arctic  in  <dig> 


RESULTS
of  <dig> reindeer samples tested by elisa for antibodies against alphaherpesvirus , seroprevalence was 47%  and adult reindeer had higher seroprevalence than yearlings. the overall seroprevalence for caribou was 60% , with no significant differences among caribou herds. a virus neutralization test of  <dig> samples from both reindeer and caribou showed that elisa positive samples always neutralized cvhv <dig> to a greater extent than bohv <dig> or elk herpesvirus , indicating that cvhv <dig> is the most likely virus circulating. pcr of nasal and ocular swabs sampled from  <dig> reindeer calves in wales, alaska  yielded four cvhv <dig> positive samples. pcr amplicons of the expected size  were obtained from  <dig> of the  <dig> buffy coats samples from caribou, and the amplicon sequences were consistent with cvhv <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that alaskan reindeer and caribou are infected with an alphaherpesvirus. based on sequence similarity, cvhv- <dig> is the most likely virus. further studies should be conducted to determine the impact of this infection on the health of these animals.
