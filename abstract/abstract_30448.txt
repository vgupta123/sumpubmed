BACKGROUND
the two variants of the α-form of the catalytic  subunit of protein kinase a , designated cα <dig> and cα <dig>  are encoded by the prkaca gene. whereas cα <dig> is ubiquitous, cα <dig> expression is restricted to the sperm cell. cα <dig> and cα <dig> are encoded with different n-terminal domains. in cα <dig> but not cα <dig> the n-terminal end introduces three sites for posttranslational modifications which include myristylation at gly <dig>  asp-specific deamidation at asn <dig> and autophosphorylation at ser <dig>  previous reports have implicated specific biological features correlating with these modifications on cα <dig>  since cα <dig> is not modified in the same way as cα <dig> we tested if they have distinct biochemical activities that may be reflected in different biological properties.


RESULTS
we show that cα <dig> interacts with the two major forms of the regulatory subunit  of pka, ri and rii, to form camp-sensitive pkai and pkaii holoenzymes both in vitro and in vivo as is also the case with cα <dig>  moreover, using surface plasmon resonance , we show that the interaction patterns of the physiological inhibitors ri, rii and pki were comparable for cα <dig> and cα <dig>  this is also the case for their potency to inhibit catalytic activities of cα <dig> and cα <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the regulatory complexes formed with either cα <dig> or cα <dig>  respectively, are indistinguishable.
