BACKGROUND
considerable attention has been paid to actinomycetes, especially the secondary metabolites obtained from streptomyces species, as the best alternatives to chemicals as biological control agents for polyphagous pests such as helicoverpa armigera and spodoptera litura. on the basis of their novel biocontrol attributes, novel polyketide metabolite isolated from marine streptomyces sp. ap- <dig> exhibited significant antifeedant, larvicidal and growth inhibitory activities against polyphagous pests.


RESULTS
leaf disc no-choice method was used for the insect bioassay. the polyketide metabolite presented significant antifeedant activities against h. armigera  and s. litura  at  <dig> ppm concentration. the metabolite also exhibited high larvicidal activities against h. armigera  and s. litura  and the lc <dig> values were  <dig>  ppm for h. armigera and  <dig>  ppm for s. litura. the metabolite also prolonged the larvalâ€“pupal duration of the insects at all the tested concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
the activities of the polyketide metabolite were concentration dependent for both the insects therefore it could be used as an agent to prepare new pesticidal formulations.
