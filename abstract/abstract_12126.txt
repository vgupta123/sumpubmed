BACKGROUND
arsenic is toxic to plants and a common environmental pollutant. there is a strong chemical similarity between arsenate  and phosphate . whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays were employed to investigate the transcriptional responses of arabidopsis thaliana plants to as  stress.


RESULTS
antioxidant-related genes  play prominent roles in response to arsenate. the microarray experiment revealed induction of chloroplast cu/zn superoxide dismutase  , cu/zn sod , as well as an sod copper chaperone . on the other hand, fe sods were strongly repressed in response to as  stress. non-parametric rank product statistics were used to detect differentially expressed genes. arsenate stress resulted in the repression of numerous genes known to be induced by phosphate starvation. these observations were confirmed with qrt-pcr and sod activity assays.


CONCLUSIONS
microarray data suggest that as  induces genes involved in response to oxidative stress and represses transcription of genes induced by phosphate starvation. this study implicates as  as a phosphate mimic in the cell by repressing genes normally induced when available phosphate is scarce. most importantly, these data reveal that arsenate stress affects the expression of several genes with little or unknown biological functions, thereby providing new putative gene targets for future research.
