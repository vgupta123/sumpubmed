BACKGROUND
meta-analysis methods exist for combining multiple microarray datasets. however, there are a wide range of issues associated with microarray meta-analysis and a limited ability to compare the performance of different meta-analysis methods.


RESULTS
we compare eight meta-analysis methods, five existing methods, two naive methods and a novel approach . comparisons are performed using simulated data and two biological case studies with varying degrees of meta-analysis complexity. the performance of meta-analysis methods is assessed via roc curves and prediction accuracy where applicable.


CONCLUSIONS
existing meta-analysis methods vary in their ability to perform successful meta-analysis. this success is very dependent on the complexity of the data and type of analysis. our proposed method, mdeds, performs competitively as a meta-analysis tool even as complexity increases. because of the varying abilities of compared meta-analysis methods, care should be taken when considering the meta-analysis method used for particular research.
