BACKGROUND
meiotic maps are a key tool for comparative genomics and association mapping studies. next-generation sequencing and genotyping by sequencing are speeding the processes of snp discovery and the development of new genetic tools, including meiotic maps for numerous species. currently there are limited genetic resources for sockeye salmon, oncorhynchus nerka. we develop the first dense meiotic map for sockeye salmon using a combination of novel snps found in restriction site associated dna  and snps available from existing expressed sequence tag  based assays.


RESULTS
we discovered and genotyped putative snps in  <dig>  rad tags. we removed paralogous sequence variants leaving  <dig>  snps; these were combined with  <dig> est-based snp genotypes for linkage mapping. the map contained  <dig> male and female linkage groups, consistent with the haploid chromosome number expected for sockeye salmon. the female map contains  <dig>  loci spanning  <dig>  cm, and the male map contains  <dig>  loci spanning  <dig>  cm. regions of conservation with rainbow trout and synteny between the rad based rainbow trout map and the sockeye salmon map were established.


CONCLUSIONS
using rad sequencing and est-based snp assays we successfully generated the first high density linkage map for sockeye salmon.
