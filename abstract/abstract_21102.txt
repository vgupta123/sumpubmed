BACKGROUND
detection of tandem duplication within coding exons, referred to as internal tandem duplication , remains challenging due to inefficiencies in alignment of itd-containing reads to the reference genome. there is a critical need to develop efficient methods to recover these important mutational events.


RESULTS
in this paper we introduce itd assembler, a novel approach that rapidly evaluates all unmapped and partially mapped reads from whole exome ngs data using a de bruijn graphs approach to select reads that harbor cycles of appropriate length, followed by assembly using overlap-layout-consensus. we tested itd assembler on the cancer genome atlas aml dataset as a truth set. itd assembler identified the highest percentage of reported flt3-itds when compared to other itd detection algorithms, and discovered additional itds in flt <dig>  kit, cebpa, wt <dig> and other genes. evidence of polymorphic itds in  <dig> genes were also found. novel itds were validated by analyzing the corresponding rna sequencing data.


CONCLUSIONS
itd assembler is a very sensitive tool which can detect partial, large and complex tandem duplications. this study highlights the need to more effectively look for itd’s in other cancers and mendelian diseases.
