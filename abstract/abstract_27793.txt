BACKGROUND
good statistical models for analyzing and simulating multilocus recombination data exist but are not accessible to many biologists because their use requires reasonably sophisticated mathematical and computational implementation. while some labs have direct access to statisticians or programmers competent to carry out such analyses, many labs do not. we have created a platform independent application with an easy-to-use graphical user interface that will carry out such analyses including the simulations needed to bootstrap confidence intervals for the parameters of interest. this software should make multi-locus techniques accessible to labs that previously relied on less powerful and potentially statistically confounded single interval or double interval techniques.


RESULTS
we introduce interferenceanalyzer, an implementation with a user-friendly graphical interface incorporating previously developed algorithms for the analysis and simulation of multilocus recombination data. we demonstrate the use and features of the program with an example of multilocus tetrad data from the mustard plant, arabidopsis thaliana, and the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae.


CONCLUSIONS
interferenceanalyzer provides easy access to the powerful and appropriate statistical tools for the multi-locus analysis of genetic data.
