BACKGROUND
in mammalian cells protein-lipid interactions at the trans-golgi network  determine the formation of vesicles, which transfer secretory proteins to the cellular membrane. this process is regulated by a complex molecular network including protein kinase d , which is directly involved in the fission of transport vesicles, and its interaction with the ceramide transfer protein cert that transports ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the tgn.


RESULTS
here we present a novel quantitative kinetic model for the interactions of the key players pkd, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase iii beta  and cert at the tgn membranes. we use sampling-based bayesian analysis and perturbation experiments for model calibration and validation.


CONCLUSIONS
our quantitative predictions of absolute molecular concentrations and reaction fluxes have major biological implications: model comparison provides evidence that pkd and cert interact in a cooperative manner to regulate ceramide transfer. furthermore, we identify active pkd to be the dominant regulator of the network, especially of cert-mediated ceramide transfer.
