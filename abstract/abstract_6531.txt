BACKGROUND
alternative splicing and polyadenylation are important mechanisms for creating the proteomic diversity necessary for the nervous system to fulfill its specialized functions. the contribution of alternative splicing to proteomic diversity in the nervous system has been well documented, whereas the role of alternative polyadenylation in this process is less well understood. since the cstf- <dig> polyadenylation protein is known to be an important regulator of tissue-specific polyadenylation, we examined its expression in brain and other organs.


RESULTS
we discovered several closely related splice variants of cstf- <dig> – collectively called βcstf- <dig> – that could potentially contribute to proteomic diversity in the nervous system. the βcstf- <dig> splice variants are found predominantly in the brains of several vertebrate species including mice and humans. the major βcstf- <dig> variant mrna is generated by inclusion of two alternate exons  found between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the cstf- <dig> gene, and contains an additional  <dig> nucleotides, encoding  <dig> additional amino acids. some variants of βcstf- <dig> contain only the first alternate exon  while other variants contain both alternate exons . in mice, the predominant form of βcstf- <dig> also contains a deletion of  <dig> nucleotides from exon  <dig>  although that variant is not seen in any other species examined, including rats. immunoblot and 2d-page analyses of mouse nuclear extracts indicate that a protein corresponding to βcstf- <dig> is expressed in brain at approximately equal levels to cstf- <dig>  since βcstf- <dig> splice variant family members were found in the brains of all vertebrate species examined , this suggests that βcstf- <dig> has an evolutionarily conserved function in these animals. βcstf- <dig> was present in both pre- and post-natal mice and in different regions of the nervous system, suggesting an important role for βcstf- <dig> in neural gene expression throughout development. finally, experiments in representative cell lines suggest that βcstf- <dig> is expressed in neurons but not glia.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of a family of splice variants encoding a key polyadenylation protein that is expressed in a nervous system-specific manner. we propose that βcstf- <dig> contributes to proteomic diversity by regulating alternative polyadenylation of neural mrnas.
