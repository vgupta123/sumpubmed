BACKGROUND
micrornas  are recently discovered short non-protein-coding rna molecules. mirnas are increasingly implicated in tissue-specific transcriptional control and particularly in development. because there is mounting evidence for the localized component of transcriptional control, we investigated if there is a distance-dependent effect of mirna.


RESULTS
we analyzed gene expression levels around the  <dig> of  <dig> know mirnas for which there are nearby gene that were measured in the data in two independent c. elegans expression data sets. the expression levels are lower for genes in the vicinity of  <dig> of  <dig>  mirnas as compared to genes far from such mirnas. analysis of the genes with lower expression in proximity to the mirnas reveals increased frequency matching of the  <dig> nucleotide "seed"s of these mirnas.


CONCLUSIONS
we found decreased messenger rna  abundance, localized within a  <dig> kb of chromosomal distance of some mirnas, in c. elegans germline. the increased frequency of seed matching near mirna can explain, in part, the localized effects.
