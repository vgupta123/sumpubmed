BACKGROUND
the osteocyte is a type of cell that appears to be one of the key endocrine regulators of bone metabolism and a key responder to initiate bone formation and remodeling. identifying the regulatory networks in osteocytes may lead to new therapies for osteoporosis and loss of bone.


RESULTS
using microarray, we identified  <dig> genes over-expressed in osteocyte, many of which have known functions in bone and muscle differentiation and contractility. we determined the evolutionarily conserved and enriched tf binding sites in the  <dig> kb promoter regions of these genes. using this data, a transcriptional regulatory network was constructed and subsequently partitioned to identify cis-regulatory modules.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that many osteocyte-specific genes, including two well-known osteocyte markers dmp <dig> and sost, have highly conserved clustering of muscle-related cis-regulatory modules, thus supporting the concept that a muscle-related gene network is important in osteocyte biology and may play a role in contractility and dynamic movements of the osteocyte.
