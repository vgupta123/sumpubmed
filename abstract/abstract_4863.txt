BACKGROUND
in highly copy number variable  regions such as the human defensin gene locus, comprehensive assessment of sequence variations is challenging. pcr approaches are practically restricted to tiny fractions, and next-generation sequencing  approaches of whole individual genomes e.g. by the  <dig> genomes project is confined by an affordable sequence depth. combining target enrichment with ngs may represent a feasible approach.


RESULTS
as a proof of principle, we enriched a ~ <dig> kb section comprising the cnv defensin gene cluster defb, the invariable defa part and  <dig> control regions from two genomes by sequence capture and sequenced it by  <dig> technology.  <dig>  differences to the human reference genome were found. comparison to hapmap genotypes revealed sensitivities and specificities in the range of 94% to 99% for the identification of variations.

using error probabilities for rigorous filtering revealed  <dig>  unique single nucleotide variations  including  <dig> putative novel ones. defb cn determinations by haplotype ratios were in agreement with alternative methods.


CONCLUSIONS
although currently labor extensive and having high costs, target enriched ngs provides a powerful tool for the comprehensive assessment of snvs in highly polymorphic cnv regions of individual genomes. furthermore, it reveals considerable amounts of putative novel variations and simultaneously allows cn estimation.
