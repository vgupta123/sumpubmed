BACKGROUND
yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family includes a group of conserved translocases that are essential for protein insertion into inner membranes of bacteria and mitochondria, and thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. because mitochondria and chloroplasts are of bacterial origin, oxa and alb <dig>  like many other mitochondrial/chloroplastic proteins, are hypothetically derived from the pre-existing protein  of bacterial endosymbionts. here, we test this hypothesis and investigate the evolutionary history of the whole yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family in the three domains of life.


RESULTS
our comprehensive analyses of the phylogenetic distribution and phylogeny of the yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family lead to the following findings: 1) in archaea, yidc homologs are only sporadically distributed in euryarchaeota; 2) most bacteria contain only one yidc gene copy; some species in a few taxa  have two gene copies; 3) eukaryotic oxa and alb <dig> have two separate prokaryotic origins, but they might not arise directly from the yidc of proteobacteria and cyanobacteria through the endosymbiosis origins of mitochondrium and chloroplast, respectively; 4) an ancient duplication occurred on both oxa and alb <dig> immediately after their origins, and thus most eukaryotes generally bear two oxa and two alb <dig>  however, secondary loss, duplication or acquisition of new domain also occurred on the two genes in some lineages, especially in protists, resulting in a rich diversity or adaptive differentiation of the two translocases in these lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
yidc is distributed in bacteria and some euryarchaeota. although mitochondrial oxa and chloroplastic alb <dig> are derived from the prokaryotic yidc, their origin might be not related to the endosymbiosis events of the two organelles. in some eukaryotic lineages, especially in protists, oxa and alb <dig> have diverse evolutionary histories. finally, a model for the evolutionary history of the entire yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family in the three domains of life is proposed.
