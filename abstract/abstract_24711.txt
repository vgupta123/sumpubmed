BACKGROUND
strigolactones are a class of plant hormones whose biosynthesis is activated in response to phosphate starvation. this involves several enzymes, including the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  <dig>  and ccd <dig> and the carotenoid isomerase dwarf <dig> . d <dig> expression is known to be responsive to phosphate starvation. in medicago truncatula and rice  this transcriptional response requires the gras-type proteins nsp <dig> and nsp2; both proteins are essential for rhizobium induced root nodule formation in legumes. in line with this, we questioned whether mtnsp1-mtnsp <dig> dependent mtd <dig> regulation is co-opted in rhizobium symbiosis.


RESULTS
we provide evidence that mtd <dig> is involved in strigolactone biosynthesis in m. truncatula roots upon phosphate stress. spatiotemporal expression studies revealed that this gene is also highly expressed in nodule primordia and subsequently becomes restricted to the meristem and distal infection zone of a mature nodules. a similar expression pattern was found for mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig>  rhizobium lipo-chitooligosaccharide  application experiments revealed that of these genes mtd <dig> is most responsive in an mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig> dependent manner. symbiotic expression of mtd <dig> requires components of the symbiosis signaling pathway; including mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi3/mtccamk and in part mtern <dig>  this in contrast to mtd <dig> expression upon phosphate starvation, which only requires mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the phosphate-starvation responsive strigolactone biosynthesis gene mtd <dig> is also rapidly induced by rhizobium lco signals in an mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp2-dependent manner. additionally, we show that mtd <dig> is co-expressed with mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in nodule primordia and in the infection zone of mature nodules.
