BACKGROUND
down-regulation of plasma membrane receptors via the endocytic pathway involves their monoubiquitylation, transport to endosomal membranes and eventual sorting into multi vesicular bodies  destined for lysosomal degradation. successive assemblies of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport  largely mediate sorting of plasma membrane receptors at endosomal membranes, the formation of multivesicular bodies and their release into the endosomal lumen. in addition, the human escrt-ii has been shown to form a complex with rna polymerase ii elongation factor ell in order to exert transcriptional control activity.


RESULTS
here we report the crystal structure of vps <dig> at  <dig>  Ã… resolution. vps <dig> crystallizes in a dimeric form and each monomer is composed of two winged helix domains arranged in tandem. structural comparisons detect no conformational changes between unliganded vps <dig> and vps <dig> within the escrt-ii complex composed of two vps <dig> copies and one copy each of vps <dig> and vps <dig>  <cit> .


CONCLUSIONS
our structural analyses present a framework for studying vps <dig> interactions with escrt-i and escrt-iii partners. winged helix domain containing proteins have been implicated in nucleic acid binding and it remains to be determined whether vps <dig> has a similar activity which might play a role in the proposed transcriptional control exerted by vps <dig> and/or the whole escrt-ii complex.
