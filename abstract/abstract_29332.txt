BACKGROUND
the number of genes characterized in liver development is steadily increasing, but the origin of liver precursor cells and the molecular control of liver formation remain poorly understood. existing theories about formation of zebrafish visceral organs emphasize either their budding from the endodermal rod or formation of independent anlage followed by their later fusion, but none of these is completely satisfactory in explaining liver organogenesis in zebrafish.


RESULTS
expression of a gene encoding the retinol binding protein  <dig>  was analyzed in zebrafish. rbp <dig>  which is expressed mainly in the liver in adults, was shown to be expressed in the yolk syncytial layer  during early embryogenesis. at 12â€“ <dig> hpf rbp <dig> expression was restricted to the ventro-lateral ysl and later expanded to cover the posterior ysl. we demonstrated that rbp <dig> expression was negatively regulated by nodal and hedgehog  signalling and positively controlled by retinoic acid . knockdown of rbp <dig> in the ysl resulted in shortened yolk extension as well as the formation of two liver buds, which could be due to impaired migration of liver progenitor cells. rbp <dig> appears also to regulate the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin <dig>  specifically in the ventro-lateral yolk, indicating a role of fn <dig> in liver progenitor migration. since exocrine pancreas, endocrine pancreas, intestine and heart developed normally in rbp <dig> morphants, we suggest that rbp <dig> expression in the ysl is required only for liver development.


CONCLUSIONS
the characteristic expression pattern of rbp <dig> suggests that the ysl is patterned despite its syncytial nature. ysl-expressed rbp <dig> plays a role in formation of both yolk extension and liver bud, the latter may also require migration of liver progenitor cells.
