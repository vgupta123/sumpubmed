BACKGROUND
the orphan nuclear receptor tr <dig>  plays a pivotal role in a variety of biological and metabolic processes. with no known ligand and few known target genes, the mode of tr <dig> function was unclear.


RESULTS
we report the first genome-wide identification and characterization of tr <dig> in vivo binding. using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing , we identified tr <dig> binding sites in  <dig> different human cell types and found that the majority of target genes were shared among different cells. tr <dig> target genes are involved in fundamental biological processes such as rna metabolism and protein translation. in addition, we found that a subset of tr <dig> target genes exerts cell-type specific functions. analysis of the tr <dig> binding sites revealed that less than 30% of the peaks from any of the cell types contained the dr <dig> motif previously derived from in vitro studies, suggesting that tr <dig> may be recruited to the genome via interaction with other proteins. a bioinformatics analysis of the tr <dig> binding sites predicted a cis regulatory module involving tr <dig> and ets transcription factors. to test this prediction, we performed chip-seq for the ets factor elk <dig> and found that 30% of tr <dig> binding sites were also bound by elk <dig>  motif analysis of the sites bound by both factors revealed a lack of the dr <dig> element, suggesting that tr <dig> binding at a subset of sites is facilitated through the ets transcription factor elk <dig>  further studies will be required to investigate the functional interdependence of these two factors.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that tr <dig> plays a pivotal role in fundamental biological processes across different cell types. in addition, the identification of cell type specific tr <dig> binding sites enables future studies of the pathways underlying tr <dig> action and its possible role in metabolic diseases.
