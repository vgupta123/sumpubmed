BACKGROUND
the castor bean , a monotypic species in the spurge family , is an important non-edible oilseed crop widely cultivated in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate countries for its high economic value. because of the high level of ricinoleic acid  in its seed oil, the castor bean seed derivatives are often used in aviation oil, lubricants, nylon, dyes, inks, soaps, adhesive and biodiesel. due to lack of efficient molecular markers, little is known about the population genetic diversity and the genetic relationships among castor bean germplasm. efficient and robust molecular markers are increasingly needed for breeding and improving varieties in castor bean. the advent of modern genomics has produced large amounts of publicly available dna sequence data. in particular, expressed sequence tags  provide valuable resources to develop gene-associated ssr markers.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig>  publicly available non-redundant castor bean est sequences, representing approximately  <dig>  mb, were evaluated and  <dig> ssr sites in  <dig>  ests were identified by data mining. castor bean exhibited considerably high frequency of est-ssrs. we developed and characterized  <dig> polymorphic est-ssr markers from  <dig> primer pairs flanking repeats by screening  <dig> castor bean samples collected from different countries. a total of  <dig> alleles were identified from  <dig> polymorphic ssr loci, ranging from 2- <dig> per locus  with an average of  <dig> . the est-ssr markers developed displayed moderate gene diversity  with an average of  <dig> . genetic relationships among  <dig> germplasms were investigated using the genotypes of  <dig> alleles, showing geographic pattern of genotypes across genetic diversity centers of castor bean.


CONCLUSIONS
castor bean est sequences exhibited considerably high frequency of ssr sites, and were rich resources for developing est-ssr markers. these est-ssr markers would be particularly useful for both genetic mapping and population structure analysis, facilitating breeding and crop improvement of castor bean.
