BACKGROUND
cancer genomes display characteristic patterns of chromosomal imbalances, often with diagnostic and prognostic relevance. therefore assays for genome-wide copy number screening and simultaneous detection of copy number alterations in specific chromosomal regions are of increasing importance in the diagnostic work-up of tumors.


RESULTS
we tested the performance of multiplex amplicon quantification, a newly developed low-cost, closed-tube and high-throughput pcr-based technique for detection of copy number alterations in regions with prognostic relevance for neuroblastoma. comparison with array cgh and the established multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method on  <dig> neuroblastoma tumors showed that multiplex amplicon quantification can reliably detect the important genomic aberrations.


CONCLUSIONS
multiplex amplicon quantification is a low-cost and high-throughput pcr-based technique that can reliably detect copy number alterations in regions with prognostic relevance for neuroblastoma.
