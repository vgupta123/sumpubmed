BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing datasets are becoming more frequent, and their use in population studies is becoming widespread. for non-model species, without a reference genome, it is possible from a panel of individuals to identify a set of snps that can be used for further population genotyping. however the lack of a reference genome to which the sequenced data could be compared makes the finding of snps more troublesome. additionally when the data sources  are not identified , the problem of finding reliable variation in these datasets can become much more difficult due to the lack of specialized software for this specific task.


RESULTS
here we describe 4pipe <dig>  a  <dig> data analysis pipeline particularly focused on snp detection when no reference or strain information is available. it uses a command line interface to automatically call other programs, parse their outputs and summarize the results. the variation detection routine is built-in in the program itself. despite being optimized for snp mining in  <dig> est data, it is flexible enough to automate the analysis of genomic data or even data from other ngs technologies. 4pipe <dig> will output several html formatted reports with metrics on many of the most common assembly values, as well as on all the variation found. there is also a module available for finding putative ssrs in the analysed datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
this program can be especially useful for researchers that have  <dig> datasets of a panel of pooled individuals and want to discover and characterize snps for subsequent individual genotyping with customized genotyping arrays. in comparison with other snp detection approaches, 4pipe <dig> showed the best validation ratio, retrieving a smaller number of snps but with a considerably lower false positive rate than other methods.
