BACKGROUND
the function and significance of the widespread expression of natural antisense transcripts  is largely unknown. the ability to quantitatively assess changes in nat expression for many different transcripts in multiple samples would facilitate our understanding of this relatively new class of rna molecules.


RESULTS
here, we demonstrate that standard expression analysis affymetrix moe <dig> and hg-u <dig> genechips contain hundreds of probe sets that detect nats. probe sets carrying a "negative strand matching probes" annotation in netaffx were validated using ensembl by manual and automated approaches. more than  <dig> % of the  <dig>  probe sets with "negative strand matching probes" on the moe <dig>  <dig>  genechip were confirmed as detecting nats. expression of selected antisense transcripts as indicated by affymetrix data was confirmed using strand-specific rt-pcr. thus, affymetrix datasets can be mined to reveal information about the regulated expression of a considerable number of nats. in a correlation analysis of  <dig> sense-antisense  probe set pairs using publicly available data from  <dig> moe <dig>  <dig>  genechips a significant number of sas transcript pairs were found to be positively correlated.


CONCLUSIONS
standard expression analysis affymetrix genechips can be used to measure many different nats. the large amount of samples deposited in microarray databases represents a valuable resource for a quantitative analysis of nat expression and regulation in different cells, tissues and biological conditions.
