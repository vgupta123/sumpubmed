BACKGROUND
the aberrant pyramidal tract  refers to the collateral pathway of the pyramidal tract  through the medial lemniscus in the midbrain and pons. using diffusion tensor tractography , we investigated the characteristics of the apt in comparison with the pt in the normal human brain.


RESULTS
in thirty-four  of the  <dig> hemispheres, the apts separated from the pt at the upper midbrain level, descended through the medial lemniscus from the midbrain to the pons, and then rejoined with the pt at the upper medulla. nine  of the  <dig> apts were found to originate from the primary somatosensory cortex without a primary motor cortex origin. values of fractional anisotropy  and tract volume of the apt were lower than those of the pt ; however, no difference in mean diffusivity  value was observed .


CONCLUSIONS
we found that the apt has different characteristics, including less directionality, fewer neural fibers, and less origin from the primary motor cortex than the pt.
