BACKGROUND
young genes and genes under positive selection commonly contribute to adaptive phenotypic evolution. early developmental stages are very important for establishing phenotypes, which might be helpful for studying the evolutionary patterns of these rapidly evolving genes.


RESULTS
here, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify modules of co-expressed genes at different stages of drosophila melanogaster development. we found that young genes, including duplicated, orphan, and young lncrna genes, are significantly enriched among modules associated with specific developmental stages. in addition, genes undergoing rapid amino acid sequence evolution driven by positive selection showed a similar proportion of essentiality with other genes, and enrichment in modules for specific developmental stages.


CONCLUSIONS
our integrative analysis revealed important roles for the origin of new genes and rapid amino acid sequence evolution in development that may account for specific phenotype evolution in drosophila melanogaster.
