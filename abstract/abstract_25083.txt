BACKGROUND
in structural genomics, an important goal is the detection and classification of protein–protein interactions, given the structures of the interacting partners. we have developed empirical energy functions to identify native structures of protein–protein complexes among sets of decoy structures. to understand the role of amino acid diversity, we parameterized a series of functions, using a hierarchy of amino acid alphabets of increasing complexity, with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acid groups. compared to previous work, we used the simplest possible functional form, with residue–residue interactions and a stepwise distance-dependence. we used increased computational ressources, however, constructing  <dig>  decoys for  <dig> protein–protein complexes, with a realistic docking protocol where the protein partners are flexible and interact through a molecular mechanics energy function. the energy parameters were optimized to correctly assign as many native complexes as possible. to resolve the multiple minimum problem in parameter space, over  <dig> starting parameter guesses were tried for each energy function. the optimized functions were tested by cross validation on subsets of our native and decoy structures, by blind tests on series of native and decoy structures available on the web, and on models for  <dig> complexes submitted to the capri structure prediction experiment.


RESULTS
performance is similar to several other statistical potentials of the same complexity. for example, the capri target structure is correctly ranked ahead of 90% of its decoys in  <dig> cases out of  <dig>  the hierarchy of amino acid alphabets leads to a coherent hierarchy of energy functions, with qualitatively similar parameters for similar amino acid types at all levels. most remarkably, the performance with six amino acid classes is equivalent to that of the most detailed, 20-class energy function.


CONCLUSIONS
this suggests that six carefully chosen amino acid classes are sufficient to encode specificity in protein–protein interactions, and provide a starting point to develop more complicated energy functions.
