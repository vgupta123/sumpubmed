BACKGROUND
polyunsaturated fatty acids  are necessary for the body's metabolism, growth and development. although pufas play an important role in the regulation of reproduction, their role in testis development in the rooster is unknown. the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of omega-3/omega- <dig>  ratios on reproductive performance in young breeder roosters. plasma levels of reproductive hormones, testis development, and reproductive hormone receptor and star mrna expression were also assessed.


RESULTS
although pufas  had no significant effect on the testis index , the spermatogonial development and germ cell layers were increased. moreover, serum levels of hormones  on day  <dig> were also significantly increased by pufas . to investigate whether pufas regulate the expression of hormone receptors and star, real time-pcr was used to measure gnrhr, fshr, lhr and star mrna levels. pufas significantly increased the mrna levels of all of these genes.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that pufas enhance the reproductive performance of young roosters by increasing hormone secretion and function, the latter by up-regulating receptor expression. these findings provide a sound basis for a balanced n-3/n- <dig> pufa ratio being beneficial to young rooster reproduction.
