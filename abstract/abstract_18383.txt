BACKGROUND
bone physiology is increasingly appreciated as an important contributor to metabolic disorders such as type  <dig> diabetes. however, progress in understanding the role of bone in determining metabolic health is hampered by the well-described difficulty of obtaining high quality rna from bone for gene expression analysis using the currently available approaches.


RESULTS
we developed a simple approach to isolate bone rna that combines pulverizing the bone and the phenol-guanidinium based rna extraction in a single step while maintaining near-freezing temperatures. this single step method increases the yield of high quality rna by eight-fold, with rna integrity numbers ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
our streamlined approach substantially increases the yield of high-quality rna from bone tissue while facilitating safe and efficient processing of multiple samples using readily available platforms. the rna obtained from this method is suitable for use in gene expression analysis in real-time quantitative pcr, microarray, and next generation sequencing applications.
