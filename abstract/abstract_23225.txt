BACKGROUND
obesity, excess fat tissue in the body, can underlie a variety of medical complaints including heart disease, stroke and cancer. the pig is an excellent model organism for the study of various human disorders, including obesity, as well as being the foremost agricultural species. in order to identify genetic variants associated with fatness, we used a selective genomic approach sampling dna from animals at the extreme ends of the fat and lean spectrum using estimated breeding values derived from a total population size of over  <dig>  animals. dna from  <dig> breeds ) was used to interrogate the illumina porcine snp <dig> genotyping beadchip in order to identify significant associations in terms of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and copy number variants .


RESULTS
by sampling animals at each end of the fat/lean ebv  spectrum the whole population could be assessed using less than  <dig> animals, without losing statistical power. indeed, several significant snps  were discovered,  <dig> of these linked to genes with ontologies that had previously been correlated with fatness . quantitative analysis of the data identified putative cnv regions containing genes whose ontology suggested fatness related functions .


CONCLUSIONS
selective genotyping of ebvs at either end of the phenotypic spectrum proved to be a cost effective means of identifying snps and cnvs associated with fatness and with estimated major effects in a large population of animals.
