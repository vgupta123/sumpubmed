BACKGROUND
long non-coding rnas  have been shown to play crucially regulatory roles in diverse biological processes involving complex mechanisms. however, information regarding the number, sequences, characteristics and potential functions of lncrnas in plants is so far overly limited.


RESULTS
using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we identified a total of  <dig>  putative lncrnas from control, osmotic stress- and salt stress-treated leaf and root samples of medicago truncatula, a model legume species. out of these lncrnas,  <dig>  and  <dig>  lncrnas were identified from osmotic stress-treated leaf and root samples, respectively. while,  <dig>  and  <dig>  lncrnas were identified from salt stress-treated leaf and root samples, respectively. to reveal their potential functions, we analyzed gene ontology  terms of genes that overlap with or are neighbors of the stress-responsive lncrnas. enrichments in go terms in biological processes such as signal transduction, energy synthesis, molecule metabolism, detoxification, transcription and translation were found.


CONCLUSIONS
lncrnas are likely involved in regulating plant’s responses and adaptation to osmotic and salt stresses in complex regulatory networks with protein-coding genes. these findings are of importance for our understanding of the potential roles of lncrnas in responses of plants in general and m. truncatula in particular to abiotic stresses.
