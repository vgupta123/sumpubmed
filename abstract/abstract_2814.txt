BACKGROUND
stress involves alterations of brain functioning that may precipitate to mood disorders. the neurotrophin brain derived neurotrophic factor  has recently been involved in stress-induced adaptation. bdnf is a key regulator of neuronal plasticity and adaptive processes. regulation of bdnf is complex and may reflect not only stress-specific mechanisms but also hormonal and emotional responses. for this reason we used, as an animal model of stress, a fish whose brain organization is very similar to that of higher vertebrates, but is generally considered free of emotional reactions.


RESULTS
we provide a comprehensive characterization of bdnf gene in the dicentrarchus labrax and its transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation following acute stress. while total bdnf mrna levels are unchanged, bdnf transcripts 1c and 1d resulted down regulated after acute stress. acute stress induces also a significant increase in probdnf levels and reduction in mature bdnf suggesting altered regulation of probdnf proteolytic processing. notably, we provide here the first evidence that fishes possess a simplified proteolytic regulation of bdnf since the pro28kda form, generated by the ski- <dig> protease in mammals, is absent in fishes because the cleavage site has first emerged in reptilians. finally, we show that the probdnf/totbdnf ratio is a highly predictive novel quantitative biomarker to detect stress in fishes with sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 87%, and negative predictive value = 100%.


CONCLUSIONS
the high predictivity of probdnf/totbdnf ratio for stress in lower vertebrates indicates that processing of bdnf is a central mechanism in adaptation to stress and predicts that a similar regulation of pro/mature bdnf has likely been conserved throughout evolution of vertebrates from fish to man.
