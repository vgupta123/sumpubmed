BACKGROUND
currently, there is very limited knowledge about the genes involved in normal pigmentation variation in east asian populations. we carried out a genome-wide scan of signatures of positive selection using the  <dig> genomes phase i dataset, in order to identify pigmentation genes showing putative signatures of selective sweeps in east asia. we applied a broad range of methods to detect signatures of selection including: 1) tests designed to identify deviations of the site frequency spectrum  from neutral expectations , 2) tests focused on the identification of high-frequency haplotypes with extended linkage disequilibrium  and 3) tests based on genetic differentiation between populations . based on the results obtained from a genome wide analysis of  <dig> kb windows, we constructed an empirical distribution for each statistic across all windows, and identified pigmentation genes that are outliers in the distribution.


RESULTS
our tests identified twenty genes that are relevant for pigmentation biology. of these, eight genes  were extreme outliers  for at least one statistic, and twelve genes  and tyrp1) were in the top 1% of the empirical distribution for at least one statistic. additionally, eight of these genes  and tyrp1) have been associated with pigmentary traits in association studies.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a number of putative pigmentation genes showing extremely unusual patterns of genetic variation in east asia. most of these genes are outliers for different tests and/or different populations, and have already been described in previous scans for positive selection, providing strong support to the hypothesis that recent selective sweeps left a signature in these regions. however, it will be necessary to carry out association and functional studies to demonstrate the implication of these genes in normal pigmentation variation.
