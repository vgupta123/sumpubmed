BACKGROUND
to study the role of african buffalos  in the maintenance of foot-and-mouth disease in uganda, serum samples were collected from  <dig> african buffalos,  <dig> impalas ,  <dig> giraffe ,  <dig> common eland ,  <dig> hartebeests  and  <dig> waterbucks  from four major national parks in uganda between  <dig> and  <dig>  serum samples were screened to detect antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus  non-structural proteins  using the ceditestÂ® fmdv ns elisa. solid phase blocking elisas  were used to determine the serotype-specificity of antibodies against the seven serotypes of fmdv among the positive samples. virus isolation and sequencing were undertaken to identify circulating viruses and determine relatedness between them.


RESULTS
among the buffalo samples tested, 85%  were positive for antibodies against fmdv non-structural proteins while one hartebeest sample out of seven  was the only positive from  <dig> other wildlife samples from a variety of different species. in the buffalo, high serotype-specific antibody titres  were found against serotypes o , sat  <dig> , sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig> . among the samples titrated for antibodies against the four serotypes o, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  17/ <dig>  had high titres against at least two serotypes.

fmdv isolates of serotypes sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  were obtained from buffalo probang samples collected in queen elizabeth national park  in  <dig>  sequence analysis and comparison of vp <dig> coding sequences showed that the sat  <dig> isolate belonged to topotype iv while the sat  <dig> isolates belonged to different lineages within the east african topotype x.


CONCLUSIONS
consistent detection of high antibody titres in buffalos supports the view that african buffalos play an important role in the maintenance of fmdv infection within national parks in uganda. both sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> viruses were isolated, and serological data indicate that it is also likely that fmdv serotypes o and sat  <dig> may be present in the buffalo population. detailed studies should be undertaken to define further the role of wildlife in the epidemiology of fmdv in east africa.
