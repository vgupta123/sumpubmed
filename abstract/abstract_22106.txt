BACKGROUND
nucleostemin is a gtpase residing in the nucleolus that is considered to be an important cancer stem/progenitor cell marker protein due to its high expression levels in breast cancer stem cells and its role in tumor initiation of human mammary tumor cells. it has been proposed that nucleostemin may represent a valuable therapeutic target for breast cancer; however, to date evidence supporting the cellular mechanism has not been elucidated.


RESULTS
expression of exogenous her <dig>  a member of the egf receptor gene family, in the human mcf-10at preneoplastic mammary epithelial cell line, formed a new breast cancer cell line, 10at-her <dig>  which is highly enriched in cells with stem/progenitor cell-like character. 10at-her <dig> cells display a cd44+/cd24-/low phenotype with high levels of the cancer stem/progenitor cell marker proteins nucleostemin, and active aldehyde dehydrogenase- <dig> . the overall expression pattern of her <dig> protein and the stem/progenitor cell marker proteins in the 10at-her <dig> cell population is similar to that of the luminal her2+ skbr <dig> human breast cancer cell line, whereas both mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells display reduced levels of nucleostemin and no detectable expression of aldh- <dig>  importantly, in contrast to the other well-established human breast cancer cell lines, 10at-her <dig> cells efficiently form tumorspheres in suspension cultures and initiate tumor xenograft formation in athymic mice at low cell numbers. furthermore, 10at-her <dig> cells are highly sensitive to the anti-proliferative apoptotic effects of indole-3-carbinol , a natural anti-cancer indole carbinol from cruciferous vegetables of the brassica genus such as broccoli and cabbage. i3c promotes the interaction of nucleostemin with mdm <dig> , an inhibitor of the p <dig> tumor suppressor, and disrupts the mdm <dig> interaction with p <dig>  i3c also induced nucleostemin to sequester mdm <dig> in a nucleolus compartment, thereby freeing p <dig> to mediate its apoptotic activity. small interfering rna knockdown of nucleostemin functionally documented that nucleostemin is required for i3c to trigger its cellular anti-proliferative responses, inhibit tumorsphere formation, and disrupt mdm2–p <dig> protein–protein interactions. furthermore, expression of an i3c-resistant form of elastase, the only known target protein for i3c, prevented i3c anti-proliferative responses in cells and in tumor xenografts in vivo, as well as disrupting the i3c-stimulated nucleostemin–mdm <dig> interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide the first evidence that a natural anti-cancer compound mediates its cellular and in vivo tumor anti-proliferative responses by selectively stimulating cellular interactions of the stem/progenitor cell marker nucleostemin with mdm <dig>  which frees p <dig> to trigger its apoptotic response. furthermore, our study provides a new mechanistic template that can potentially be exploited for the development of therapeutic strategies targeted at cancer stem/progenitor cells.
