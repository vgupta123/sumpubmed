BACKGROUND
accurate, rapid, and economic on-line analysis of ethanol is very desirable. however, available biosensors achieve saturation at very low ethanol concentrations and thus demand the time and labour consuming procedure of sample dilution.


RESULTS
hansenula polymorpha  mutant strains resistant to allyl alcohol in methanol medium were selected. such strains possessed decreased affinity of alcohol oxidase  towards methanol: the km values for aox of wild type and mutant strains ca <dig> and ca <dig> are shown to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively, whereas vmax values are increased or remain unaffected. the mutant aox alleles from h. polymorpha mutants ca <dig> and ca <dig> were isolated and sequenced. several point mutations in the aox gene, mostly different between the two mutant alleles, have been identified. mutant aox forms were isolated and purified, and some of their biochemical properties were studied. an amperometric biosensor based on the mutated form of aox from the strain ca <dig> was constructed and revealed an extended linear response to the target analytes, ethanol and formaldehyde, as compared to the sensor based on the native aox.


CONCLUSIONS
the described selection methodology opens up the possibility of isolating modified forms of aox with further decreased affinity toward substrates without reduction of the maximal velocity of reaction. it can help in creation of improved ethanol biosensors with a prolonged linear response towards ethanol in real samples of wines, beers or fermentation liquids.
