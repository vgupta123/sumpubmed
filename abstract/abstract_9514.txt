BACKGROUND
although acetylsalicylic acid  is not frequently used as a therapeutic agent in horses, its metabolite sa is of special interest in equestrianism since it is a natural component of many plants used as horse feed. this led to the establishment of thresholds by horse sport organizations for sa in urine and plasma. the aim of this study was to investigate plasma and urine concentrations of salicylic acid  after oral administration of three different single dosages  of acetylsalicylic acid  to eight horses in a cross-over designed study.


RESULTS
in the  <dig>  mg/kg group, sa concentrations in urine peaked 2 h after oral administration ; plasma concentrations peaked at  <dig>  h . in the 25 mg/kg group, maximum concentrations were detected after 2 h  and  <dig>  h . in the 50 mg/kg group, maximum concentrations were observed after 5 h  and  <dig>  h . the plasma half-life calculated for sa varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  h. the urine concentration of sa fell below the threshold of 750 μg/ml  between  <dig> and 26 h after administration of  <dig>  and 25 mg/kg asa and between  <dig> and 36 h after administration of 50 mg/kg asa. for asa, ic <dig> were  <dig>  μg/ml  and  <dig>  μg/ml . for salicylic acid, it was not possible to calculate an ic <dig> for either cox due to insufficient inhibition of both cyclooxygenases.


CONCLUSIONS
the established sa thresholds of 750 μg//ml urine and  <dig>  μg/ml plasma appear too generous and are leaving space for misuse of the anti-inflammatory and analgetic compound asa in horses.
