BACKGROUND
prostate cancer is a known cause of mortality in men worldwide although the risk factor varies among different ethnic groups. loss of the y chromosome is a common chromosomal abnormality observed in the human prostate cancer.


RESULTS
we screened  <dig> standard sequence tagged sites  corresponding to a male-specific region of the y chromosome , sequenced the coding region of the sry gene and assessed the status of the dyz <dig> arrays in the human prostate cancer cell lines du <dig> and lncap. the msy was found to be intact and coding region of sry showed no sequence variation in both the cell lines. however, dyz <dig> arrays showed sequence and copy number variations. du <dig> and lncap cells were found to carry  <dig> and  <dig> copies of the dyz <dig>  respectively per  <dig>  pg of genomic dna. the dyz <dig> copies detected in these cell lines are much below the average of that reported in normal human males. similarly, the number of “ttcca” repeat and its derivatives within the dyz <dig> arrays showed variation compared to those of the normal males.


CONCLUSIONS
clearly, the dyz <dig> is maximally affected in both the cell lines. work on additional cell lines and biopsied samples would augment our understanding about the susceptibility of this region. based on the present work, we construe that copy number status of the dyz <dig> may be exploited as a supplementary prognostic tool to monitor the occurrence of prostate cancer using biopsied samples.
