BACKGROUND
axial osteitis of the proximal sesamoid bones and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament has been described in friesian horses as well as in other breeds. the objectives of this study were to review the outcome of clinical cases of this disease in friesian horses and analyse the pathology of the bone-ligament interface. case records of friesian horses diagnosed with axial osteitis of the proximal sesamoid bones and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament in the period 2002- <dig> were retrospectively evaluated. post-mortem examination was performed on horses that were euthanized  and included macroscopic necropsy , high-field  magnetic resonance imaging  and histopathology .


RESULTS
twelve horses were included, aged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years. the hindlimb was involved in all cases. lameness was acute in onset and severe, with a mean duration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  months. three horses were euthanized after diagnosis;  <dig> horses underwent treatment. two horses  became sound for light riding purposes,  <dig> horses  became pasture sound ,  <dig> horses  remained lame. in addition to bone resorption at the proximo-axial margin of the proximal sesamoid bones, magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology showed osteoporosis of the peripheral compact bone and spongious bone of the proximal sesamoid bones and chronic inflammation of the intersesamoidean ligament.


CONCLUSIONS
axial osteitis of the proximal sesamoid bones and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament in the hindlimb of friesian horses carries a poor prognosis. pathological characterization  may help in unravelling the aetiology of this disease.
