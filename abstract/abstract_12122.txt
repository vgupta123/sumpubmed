BACKGROUND
o-antigen  of the lipopolysaccharide is a highly variable cell component of the outer membrane in shigella flexneri. it defines the serospecificity and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of shigellosis. there are two distinct o-antigen forms for the  <dig> serotypes of s. flexneri: one for serotypes 1– <dig>  x, y,  <dig> , and the other for serotype  <dig>  although having different basal o-polysaccharide structures, the two forms share a common disaccharide fragment . in serotype  <dig> and some non- <dig> serotypes, rhaiii is o-acetylated at position either  <dig> or  <dig> , conferring to the hosts a novel antigenic determinant named o-factor  <dig>  an acyltransferase gene  responsible for this modification has been identified in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and y, but not in serotype  <dig> 


RESULTS
using genetic, serological, and chemical approaches, another acyltransferase gene named oacc was demonstrated to be responsible for the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii in the o-antigen of s. flexneri serotype  <dig>  inactivation of the oacc gene resulted in the loss of the 3/4-o-acetyltion, and the cloned oacc gene restored this modification upon transformation. in accordance with the similarity in the acceptor substrate structure and high sequence homology  between oacc and oacb, oacc has the interchangeable function with the oacb gene in mediation of the 3/4-o-acetylation. the oacc gene is located in a prophage on the chromosome and presented in all  <dig> serotype  <dig> strains tested.


CONCLUSIONS
identification and functional characterization of the o-acetyltransferase encoding gene, oacc, shows that it is involved in o-antigen modification by 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii specific to serotype  <dig>
