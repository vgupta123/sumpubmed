BACKGROUND
in arabidopsis, eto <dig>  is a negative regulator of ethylene evolution by interacting with atacs <dig>  an isoform of the rate-limiting enzyme, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases , in ethylene biosynthetic pathway. eto <dig> directly inhibits the enzymatic activity of atacs <dig>  in addition, a specific interaction between eto <dig> and atcul <dig>  a constituent of a new type of e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex, suggests the molecular mechanism in promoting atacs <dig> degradation by the proteasome-dependent pathway. because orthologous sequences to eto <dig> are found in many plant species including tomato, we transformed tomato with arabidopsis eto <dig> to evaluate its ability to suppress ethylene production in tomato fruits.


RESULTS
transgenic tomato lines that overexpress arabidopsis eto <dig>  did not show a significant delay of fruit ripening. so, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays to investigate potential heterologous interaction between eto <dig> and three isozymes of acc synthases from tomato. in the yeast two-hybrid system, eto <dig> interacts with le-acs <dig> as well as atacs <dig> but not with le-acs <dig> or le-acs <dig>  two major isozymes whose gene expression is induced markedly in ripening fruits. according to the classification of acc synthases, which is based on the c-terminal amino acid sequences, both le-acs <dig> and atacs <dig> are categorized as type  <dig> isozymes and possess a consensus c-terminal sequence. in contrast, le-acs <dig> and le-acs <dig> are type  <dig> and type  <dig> isozymes, respectively, both of which do not possess this specific c-terminal sequence. yeast two-hybrid analysis using chimeric constructs between le-acs <dig> and le-acs <dig> revealed that the type-2-acs-specific c-terminal tail is required for interaction with eto <dig>  when treated with auxin to induce le-acs <dig>  seedlings of eto1-oe produced less ethylene than the wild type, despite comparable expression of the le-acs <dig> gene in the wild type.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that eto <dig> family proteins specifically interact with and negatively regulate type  <dig> acc synthases. our data also show that arabidopsis eto <dig> can regulate type  <dig> acs in a heterologous plant, tomato.
