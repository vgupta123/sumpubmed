BACKGROUND
a population reference database of complete human mitochondrial genome  sequences is needed to enable the use of mitochondrial dna  coding region data in forensic casework applications. however, the development of entire mtgenome haplotypes to forensic data quality standards is difficult and laborious. a sanger-based amplification and sequencing strategy that is designed for automated processing, yet routinely produces high quality sequences, is needed to facilitate high-volume production of these mtgenome data sets.


RESULTS
we developed a robust 8-amplicon sanger sequencing strategy that regularly produces complete, forensic-quality mtgenome haplotypes in the first pass of data generation. the protocol works equally well on samples representing diverse mtdna haplogroups and dna input quantities ranging from  <dig> pg to  <dig> ng, and can be applied to specimens of varying dna quality. the complete workflow was specifically designed for implementation on robotic instrumentation, which increases throughput and reduces both the opportunities for error inherent to manual processing and the cost of generating full mtgenome sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
the described strategy will assist efforts to generate complete mtgenome haplotypes which meet the highest data quality expectations for forensic genetic and other applications. additionally, high-quality data produced using this protocol can be used to assess mtdna data developed using newer technologies and chemistries. further, the amplification strategy can be used to enrich for mtdna as a first step in sample preparation for targeted next-generation sequencing.
