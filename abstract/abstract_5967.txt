BACKGROUND
there is a large amount of microarray data accumulating in public databases, providing various data waiting to be analyzed jointly. powerful kernel-based methods are commonly used in microarray analyses with support vector machines  to approach a wide range of classification problems. however, the standard vectorial data kernel family  that takes vectorial data as input, often fails in prediction if the data come from different platforms or laboratories, due to the low gene overlaps or consistencies between the different datasets.


RESULTS
we introduce a new type of kernel called maximum entropy  kernel, which has no pre-defined function but is generated by kernel entropy maximization with sample distance matrices as constraints, into the field of svm classification of microarray data. we assessed the performance of the me kernel with three different data: heterogeneous kidney carcinoma, noise-introduced leukemia, and heterogeneous oral cavity carcinoma metastasis data. the results clearly show that the me kernel is very robust for heterogeneous data containing missing values and high-noise, and gives higher prediction accuracies than the standard kernels, namely, linear, polynomial and rbf.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate its utility in effectively analyzing promiscuous microarray data of rare specimens, e.g., minor diseases or species, that present difficulty in compiling homogeneous data in a single laboratory.
