BACKGROUND
bcl- <dig> family proteins are key regulators of mitochondrial integrity and comprise both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. bax a pro-apoptotic member localizes as monomers in the cytosol of healthy cells and accumulates as oligomers in mitochondria of apoptotic cells. the bcl- <dig> homology- <dig>  domain regulates interactions within the family, but regions other than bh <dig> are also critical for bax function. thus, the n-terminus has been variously implicated in targeting to mitochondria, interactions with bh3-only proteins as well as conformational changes linked to bax activation. the transmembrane  domains  in bax are implicated in localization to mitochondria and triggering cytotoxicity. here we have investigated n-terminus modulation of tm function in the context of regulation by the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl.


RESULTS
deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the bax n-terminus  caused constitutive accumulation at mitochondria and triggered high levels of cytotoxicity, not inhibited by bcl-xl. removal of the tm domains  abrogated mitochondrial localization but resulted in bcl-xl regulated activation of endogenous bax and bax-bak dependent apoptosis. inclusion of the α5-α <dig> helices/tmi domain  phenocopied bax 30– <dig> as it restored mitochondrial localization, bcl-xl independent cytotoxicity and was not dependent on endogenous bax-bak. inhibition of function and localization by bcl-xl was restored in bax 1– <dig>  which included the tm <dig> domain. regardless of regulation by bcl-xl, all n-terminal deleted constructs immunoprecipitated bcl-xland converged on caspase- <dig> dependent apoptosis consistent with mitochondrial involvement in the apoptotic cascade. sub-optimal sequence alignments of bax and bcl-xl indicated a sequence similarity between the α5–α <dig> helices of bax and bcl-xl. alanine substitutions of three residues  in the n-terminus  attenuated regulation by the serine-threonine kinase akt/pkb but not by bcl-xl indicative of distinct regulatory mechanisms.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the analysis of bax deletion constructs indicates that the n-terminus drives conformational changes facilitating inhibition of cytotoxicity by bcl-xl. we speculate that the tm <dig> helices may serve as 'structural antagonists' for bh3-bcl-xl interactions, with this function being regulated by the n-terminus in the intact protein.
