BACKGROUND
anticarsia gemmatalis is a pest in south america's soybean crops, which could be controlled by the multinucleopolyhedrovirus of a. gemmatalis . currently, its commercial production is based on infected larvae. however, the possibility of using modified baculoviruses in integrated pest management programs has stimulated an interest to develop alternative multiplication processes. this study evaluated the agmnpv production in ufl-ag- <dig> cells previously deprived fetal bovine serum.


RESULTS
culture media containing 1% fbs during the previous  <dig> hours achieved a synchronized condition where 90% of cells were found in g0/g <dig> stage, showing the presence of non-filamentous actin. all characteristics were estimated from cellular viability tests, cell actin detection trials and flow cytometer cell cycle analysis. agmnpv production was tested by transcript studies and budded viruses  and occlusion bodies  yield quantitation. results showed that the productivity in fbs deprived cells was  <dig>  times more in bvs and  <dig>  times more in obs with respect to non-treated cells.


CONCLUSIONS
ufl-ag- <dig> cells previously deprived in fbs shown to be a better host for agmnpv propagation, increasing the useful for both in vitro bioinsecticide production and applications such as recombinant protein expression or gene delivery.
