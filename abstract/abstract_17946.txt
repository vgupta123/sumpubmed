BACKGROUND
protein arginine methylation is a post-translational modification involved in important biological processes such as transcription and rna processing. this modification is catalyzed by both type i and ii protein arginine methyltransferases . one of the most conserved type i prmts is prmt <dig>  the homolog of which is hmt <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae. hmt <dig> has been shown to play a role in various gene expression steps, such as promoting the dynamics of messenger ribonucleoprotein particle  biogenesis, pre-mrna splicing, and silencing of chromatin. to determine the full extent of hmt1â€™s involvement during gene expression, we carried out a genome-wide location analysis for hmt <dig> 


RESULTS
a comprehensive genome-wide binding profile for hmt <dig> was obtained by chip-chip using nimblegen high-resolution tiling microarrays. of the approximately  <dig> hmt1-binding sites found, the majority fall within or proximal to an orf. different occupancy patterns of hmt <dig> across genes with different transcriptional rates were found. interestingly, hmt <dig> occupancy is found at a number of other genomic features such as trna and snorna genes, thereby implicating a regulatory role in the biogenesis of these non-coding rnas. rna hybridization analysis shows that hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants display higher steady-state trna abundance relative to the wild-type. co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that hmt <dig> interacts with the tfiiib component bdp <dig>  suggesting a mechanism for hmt <dig> in modulating rna pol iii transcription to regulate trna production.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome-wide binding profile of hmt <dig> reveals multiple potential new roles for hmt <dig> in the control of eukaryotic gene expression, especially in the realm of non-coding rnas. the data obtained here will provide an important blueprint for future mechanistic studies on the described occupancy relationship for genomic features bound by hmt <dig>
