BACKGROUND
endolysins produced by bacteriophages lyse bacteria, and are thus considered a novel type of antimicrobial agent. several endolysins from bacillus phages or prophages have previously been characterized and used to target bacillus strains that cause disease in animals and humans. b. thuringiensis phage btcs <dig> is a siphoviridae family phage and its genome has been sequenced and analyzed. in the btcs <dig> genome, orf <dig> was found to encode an endolysin protein .


RESULTS
bioinformatic analyses showed that endolysin plybt <dig> was composed of two functional domains, the n-terminal catalytic domain and the c-terminal cell wall binding domain. in this study, the entire endolysin plybt <dig>  and both the n- and c-termini,were expressed in escherichia coli and then purified. the lytic activities of plybt <dig> and its n-terminus were tested on bacteria. both regions exhibited lytic activity, although plybt <dig> showed a higher lytic activity than the n-terminus. plybt <dig> exhibited activity against all bacillus strains tested from five different species, but was not active against gram-negative bacteria. optimal conditions for plybt <dig> reactivity were ph  <dig>  and 50°c. plybt <dig> showed high thermostability, with 40% of initial activity remaining following  <dig> h of treatment at 60°c. the c-terminus of plybt <dig> bound to b. thuringiensis strain hd- <dig> and bacillus subtilis strain  <dig>  this cell wall binding domain might be novel, as its amino acid sequence showed little similarity to previously reported endolysins.


CONCLUSIONS
plybt <dig> showed potential as a novel antimicrobial agent at a relatively high temperature and had a broad lytic spectrum within the bacillus genus. the c-terminus of plybt <dig> might be a novel kind of cell wall binding domain.
