BACKGROUND
there have been an increasing number of infections in fish associated with different species of chryseobacterium, being considered potentially emerging pathogens. nevertheless the knowledge of the diversity of species associated with fish disease is partial due to the problems for a correct identification at the species level based exclusively on phenotypic laboratory methods.


RESULTS
chryseobacterium shigense was isolated from the liver, kidney and gills of diseased rainbow trout in different disease episodes that occurred in a fish farm between may  <dig> and june  <dig>  identity of the isolates was confirmed by 16â€‰s rrna gene sequencing and phenotypic characterization. isolates represented a single strain as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first description of the recovery of c. shigense from clinical specimens in trout, a very different habitat to fresh lactic acid beverage where it was initially isolated.
