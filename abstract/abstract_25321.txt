BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is one of the major public health concerns worldwide. the detection of the pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis complex  as early as possible has a great impact on the effective control of the spread of the disease. in our study, we evaluated the hyplex® tbc pcr test , a novel assay using a nucleic acid amplification technique  with reverse hybridisation and elisa read out for the rapid detection of m. tuberculosis directly in clinical samples.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> respiratory and non-respiratory specimens from our pneumological hospital and the national tb institute of uzbekistan were used for the evaluation of the pcr assay. of these,  <dig> were classified as tb samples and  <dig> as non-tb samples based on the results of the tb cultures as reference method. the pcr results were initially used to optimise the cut-off value of the hyplex® tbc test system by means of a roc analysis. the overall sensitivity of the assay was determined to be  <dig> %. in smear-positive tb samples, the sensitivity of the hyplex® tbc pcr test was estimated to  <dig> % versus  <dig> % in smear-negative samples. the specificity of the test was  <dig> %. of the two specimens  with false-positive pcr results, one yielded a culture positive for non-tuberculous mycobacteria. based on the assumption of a prevalence of 8% tb positives among the samples in our diagnostic tb laboratory, the positive and negative predictive values were estimated to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the hyplex® tbc pcr test is an accurate naat assay for a rapid and reliable detection of m. tuberculosis in various respiratory and non-respiratory specimens. compared to many other conventional naat assays, the hyplex® tbc pcr test is in a low price segment which makes it an attractive option for developing and emerging countries with high tb burdens.
