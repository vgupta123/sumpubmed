BACKGROUND
during natural trypanosoma brucei infections, the parasites differentiate spontaneously into a non-dividing “stumpy” form when a certain level of parasitaemia is attained. this form is metabolically adapted for rapid further differentiation into procyclic forms upon uptake by tsetse flies.


RESULTS
we describe here four central ugandan isolates of trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense that have undergone only three rodent passages since isolation from human patients. as expected, snp analysis shows that these isolates are more closely related to each other than to the commonly used strains lister  <dig>  antat <dig> , and treu <dig>  treu <dig> generally has smaller copy numbers of repeated genes than the other strains, while lister  <dig> trypanosomes with a 30-year history of in vitro culture and cloning have more histone genes than the other isolates. the recently isolated trypanosomes were grown in rats, and their transcriptomes characterised. in comparison with cultured procyclic and bloodstream forms, there were increases in mrnas encoding the stumpy-form markers esag <dig> and pip <dig>  with coordinated alterations in the levels of over  <dig> additional mrnas. numerous mrnas encoding proteins of no known function were either increased or decreased. the products of the mrnas that were increased in parallel with pip <dig> included not only enzymes of procyclic-form metabolism, but also components of the translational and rna control machineries. many of the mrnas that were decreased in cells with elevated pip <dig> reflected reduced cell division.


CONCLUSIONS
these transcriptomes suggest new avenues for research into the regulation of trypanosome differentiation.
