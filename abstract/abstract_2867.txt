BACKGROUND
adpa is a key transcriptional regulator involved in the complex growth cycle of streptomyces. streptomyces are gram-positive bacteria well-known for their production of secondary metabolites and antibiotics. most work on adpa has been in s. griseus, and little is known about the pathways it controls in other streptomyces spp. we recently discovered interplay between clpp peptidases and adpa in s. lividans. here, we report the identification of genes directly regulated by adpa in s. lividans.


RESULTS
microarray experiments revealed that the expression of hundreds of genes was affected in a s. lividans adpa mutant during early stationary phase cultures in yeme liquid medium. we studied the expression of the s. lividans adpa-regulated genes by quantitative real-time pcr analysis after various times of growth. in silico analysis revealed the presence of potential adpa-binding sites upstream from these genes; electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that adpa binds directly to their promoter regions. this work identifies new pathways directly controlled by adpa and that are involved in s. lividans development , and primary  or secondary  metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
we characterised six s. lividans adpa-dependent genes whose expression is directly activated by this pleiotropic regulator. several of these genes are orthologous to blda-dependent genes in s. coelicolor. furthermore, in silico analysis suggests that over hundred genes may be directly activated or repressed by s. lividans adpa, although few have been described as being part of any streptomyces adpa regulons. this study increases the number of known adpa-regulated pathways in streptomyces spp.
