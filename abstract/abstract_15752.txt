BACKGROUND
bacillus subtilis natto is closely related to the laboratory standard strain b. subtilis marburg  <dig>  and functions as a starter for the production of the traditional japanese food "natto" made from soybeans. although re-sequencing whole genomes of several laboratory domesticated b. subtilis  <dig> derivatives has already been attempted using short read sequencing data, the assembly of the whole genome sequence of a closely related strain, b. subtilis natto, from very short read data is more challenging, particularly with our aim to assemble one fully connected scaffold from short reads around  <dig> bp in length.


RESULTS
we applied a comparative genome assembly method, which combines de novo assembly and reference guided assembly, to one of the b. subtilis natto strains. we successfully assembled  <dig> scaffolds and managed to avoid substantial fragmentation. completion of the assembly through long pcr experiments resulted in one connected scaffold for b. subtilis natto. based on the assembled genome sequence, our orthologous gene analysis between natto best <dig> and marburg  <dig> revealed that  <dig> % of  <dig> predicted genes in best <dig> are one-to-one orthologous to genes in  <dig>  with two genes in-paralog,  <dig> % are deleted in  <dig>   <dig> % are inserted in best <dig>  and  <dig> % of genes present in  <dig> are deleted in best <dig>  the natto genome contains the same alleles in the promoter region of degq and the coding region of swraa as the wild strain, ro-ff- <dig> 

these are specific for Î³-pga production ability, which is related to natto production. further, the b. subtilis natto strain completely lacked a polyketide synthesis operon, disrupted the plipastatin production operon, and possesses previously unidentified transposases.


CONCLUSIONS
the determination of the whole genome sequence of bacillus subtilis natto provided detailed analyses of a set of genes related to natto production, demonstrating the number and locations of insertion sequences that b. subtilis natto harbors but b. subtilis  <dig> lacks. multiple genome-level comparisons among five closely related bacillus species were also carried out. the determined genome sequence of b. subtilis natto and gene annotations are available from the natto genome browser http://natto-genome.org/.
