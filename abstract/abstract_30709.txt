BACKGROUND
wolbachia is a genus of endosymbiotic Î±-proteobacteria infecting a wide range of arthropods and filarial nematodes. wolbachia is able to induce reproductive abnormalities such as cytoplasmic incompatibility , thelytokous parthenogenesis, feminization and male killing, thus affecting biology, ecology and evolution of its hosts. the bacterial group has prompted research regarding its potential for the control of agricultural and medical disease vectors, including glossina spp., which transmits african trypanosomes, the causative agents of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals.


RESULTS
in the present study, we employed a wolbachia specific 16s rrna pcr assay to investigate the presence of wolbachia in six different laboratory stocks as well as in natural populations of nine different glossina species originating from  <dig> african countries. wolbachia was prevalent in glossina morsitans morsitans, g. morsitans centralis and g. austeni populations. it was also detected in g. brevipalpis, and, for the first time, in g. pallidipes and g. palpalis gambiensis. on the other hand, wolbachia was not found in g. p. palpalis, g. fuscipes fuscipes and g. tachinoides. wolbachia infections of different laboratory and natural populations of glossina species were characterized using 16s rrna, the wsp  gene and mlst  gene markers. this analysis led to the detection of horizontal gene transfer events, in which wobachia genes were inserted into the tsetse flies fly nuclear genome.


CONCLUSIONS
wolbachia infections were detected in both laboratory and natural populations of several different glossina species. the characterization of these wolbachia strains promises to lead to a deeper insight in tsetse flies-wolbachia interactions, which is essential for the development and use of wolbachia-based biological control methods.
