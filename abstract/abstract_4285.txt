BACKGROUND
examination of late gestation developmental genes in vivo may be limited by early embryonic lethality and compensatory mechanisms. this problem is particularly apparent in evaluating the developmental role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  gene in the cystic fibrosis  phenotype. a previously described transient in utero knockout  technology was used to address the developmental role of cftr in the rat lung.


RESULTS
rat fetuses transiently treated with antisense cftr in utero developed pathology that replicated aspects of the human cf phenotype. the tiuko cf rat developed lung fibrosis, chronic inflammation, reactive airway disease, and the cf antigen , a marker for cf in human patients, was expressed.


CONCLUSIONS
the transient in utero antisense technology can be used to evaluate genes that exhibit either early lethality or compensating gene phenotypes. in the lung cftr is part of a developmental cascade for normal secretory cell differentiation. absence of cftr results in a constitutive inflammatory process that is involved in some aspects of cf pathophysiology.
