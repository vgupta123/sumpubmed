BACKGROUND
luciferase assay systems enable the real-time monitoring of gene expression in living cells. we have developed a dual-color luciferase assay system in which the expression of multiple genes can be tracked simultaneously using green- and red-emitting beetle luciferases. we have applied the system to monitoring independent gene expressions in two types of cocultured fibroblasts in real time.


RESULTS
two rat- <dig> cell lines were established that stably express either green- or red-emitting luciferases under the control of the mbmal <dig> promoter, a canonical clock gene. we cocultured these cell lines, and gene expression profiles in both were monitored simultaneously. the circadian rhythms of these cell lines are independent, oscillating following their intrinsic circadian phases, even when cocultured. furthermore, the independent rhythms were synchronized by medium change as an external stimulus.


CONCLUSIONS
using this system, we successfully monitored independent gene expression patterns in two lines of cocultured fibroblasts.
