BACKGROUND
biological nitrogen fixation in root nodules is a process of great importance to crops of soybean , as it may provide the bulk of the plant’s needs for nitrogen. legume nodulation involves several complex steps and, although studied for many decades, much remains to be understood.


RESULTS
this research aimed at analyzing the global expression of genes in soybean roots of a brazilian cultivar  inoculated with bradyrhizobium japonicum cpac  <dig>  a strain broadly used in commercial inoculants in brazil. to achieve this, we used the suppressive subtractive hybridization  technique combined with illumina sequencing. the subtractive library  of soybean roots resulted in  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts at 10 days after inoculation were studied. the data were grouped according to the ontologies of the molecular functions and biological processes. several classes of genes were confirmed as related to n <dig> fixation and others were reported for the first time.


CONCLUSIONS
during nodule formation, a higher percentage of genes were related to primary metabolism, cell-wall modifications and the antioxidant defense system. putative symbiotic functions were attributed to some of these genes for the first time.
