BACKGROUND
the proteasome is a multi-subunit protein machine that is the final destination for cellular proteins that have been marked for degradation via an ubiquitin  chain appendage. these ubiquitylated proteins either bind directly to the intrinsic proteasome ubiqutin chain receptors rpn <dig>  rpn <dig>  or rpt <dig>  or are shuttled to the proteasome by rad <dig>  dsk <dig>  or ddi <dig>  the latter proteins share an ub association domain  for binding poly-ub chains and an ub-like-domain  for binding to the proteasome. it has been proposed that shuttling receptors dock on the proteasome via rpn <dig>  but the precise nature of the docking site remains poorly defined.


RESULTS
to shed light on the recruitment of shuttling receptors to the proteasome, we performed both site-directed mutagenesis and genetic screening to identify mutations in rpn <dig> that disrupt its binding to uba-ubl proteins. here we demonstrate that delivery of ub conjugates and docking of ddi <dig>  to the proteasome are strongly impaired by an aspartic acid to alanine point mutation in the highly-conserved d <dig> residue of rpn <dig>  moreover, degradation of the ddi1-dependent proteasome substrate, ufo <dig>  is blocked in rpn1-d517a yeast cells. by contrast, rad <dig> recruitment to the proteasome is not affected by rpn1-d517a.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies provide insight into the mechanism by which the uba-ubl protein ddi <dig> is recruited to the proteasome to enable ub-dependent degradation of its ligands. our studies suggest that different uba-ubl proteins are recruited to the proteasome by distinct mechanisms.
