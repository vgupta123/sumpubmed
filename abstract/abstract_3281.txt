BACKGROUND
the neuroinflammatory response aimed at clearance of herpes simplex virus- <dig>  plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuroaxonal damage in herpetic encephalitis. leukocytes activated in an adaptive immune response access brain tissue by passing through the bloodâ€“brain barrier. the chemokine ccl5/rantes is involved in recruitment of these cells to the brain acting via the receptors ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and mainly ccr <dig>  here, we evaluated the role of ccr <dig> on traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature, cellular and cytokines profile in a severe form of herpetic encephalitis.


RESULTS
wild type and mice lacking ccr <dig>  were inoculated intracerebrally with  <dig> pfu of neurotropic hsv- <dig>  we evaluated the traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature using intravital microscopy and the profile of cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at  <dig> day post infection. flow cytometry and histopathological analyses were also carried out in brain tissue. absence of ccr <dig> leads to lower viral load and an increased leukocyte adhesion in brain microvasculature, predominantly of neutrophils . moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of mip-1/ccl <dig>  rantes/ccl <dig>  kc/cxcl <dig> and mig/cxcl <dig> in the brain of infected ccr5-/- mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the absence of ccr <dig> may boost the immune response with a high neutrophil recruitment which most likely helps in viral clearance. nonetheless, the elevated immune response may be detrimental to the host.
