BACKGROUND
endothelin- <dig>  is a potent vasoconstrictor, and astrocytic et- <dig> is reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic injury and cytotoxic edema. however, it is still unknown whether astrocytic et- <dig> also contributes to vasogenic edema and vasospasm during subarachnoid hemorrhage . in the present study, transgenic mice with astrocytic endothelin- <dig> over-expression  were used to investigate the pathophysiological role of et- <dig> in sah pathogenesis.


RESULTS
the get- <dig> mice experienced a higher mortality rate and significantly more severe neurological deficits, blood–brain barrier breakdown and vasogenic edema compared to the non-transgenic  mice following sah. oral administration of vasopressin v1a receptor antagonist, sr  <dig>  significantly reduced the cerebral water content in the get- <dig> mice. furthermore, the get- <dig> mice showed significantly more pronounced middle cerebral arterial  constriction after sah. immunocytochemical analysis showed that the calcium-activated potassium channels and the phospho-enos were significantly downregulated, whereas pkc-α expression was significantly upregulated in the mca of the get- <dig> mice when compared to ntg mice after sah. administration of abt- <dig>  significantly down-regulated pkc-α expression in the mca of the get- <dig> mice following sah.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study suggests that astrocytic et- <dig> involves in sah-induced cerebral injury, edema and vasospasm, through eta receptor and pkc-mediated potassium channel dysfunction. administration of abt- <dig>  and sr  <dig>  resulted in amelioration of edema and vasospasm in mice following sah. these data provide a strong rationale to investigate sr  <dig> and abt- <dig> as therapeutic drugs for the treatment of sah patients.
