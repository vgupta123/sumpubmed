BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenously expressed small rnas with a length of about  <dig> nt. mirnas silence their target genes at the post-transcriptional level. in plants, mirnas play various developmental and physiological roles by cleavaging mrnas predominantly. drought and high salinity are the most severe environmental abiotic stresses and cause crop losses all over the world.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified mir-169g and mir-169n  as high salinity-responsive mirnas in rice. mir-169n and mir169o were in a mirna cluster with a distance of  <dig> base pairs . the high degree of conservation and close phylogenic distance of pre-mir-169n and pre-mir-169o indicated that they were derived from a very recent tandem duplication evolutionary event. the existence of a cis-acting abscisic acid responsive element  in the upstream region of mir-169n  suggested that mir-169n  may be regulated by aba. in our previous study, we found that mir-169g was induced by the osmotic stress caused by drought via a dehydration-responsive element . thus, our data showed that there were both overlapping and distinct responses of the mir- <dig> family to drought and salt stresses. we also showed that these mir- <dig> members selectively cleaved one of the nf-ya genes, os03g <dig>  which is a ccaat-box binding transcription factor and participates in transcriptional regulation of large number genes. finally, we found one or more ath-mir- <dig> member that was also induced by high salinity.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified members of the mir- <dig> family as salt-induced mirnas and analyzed their evolution, gene organization, expression, transcriptional regulation motif and target gene. our data also indicated that the salt-induction of some mir- <dig> members was a general property in plants.
