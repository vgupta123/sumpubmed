BACKGROUND
streptomyces species are a major source of antibiotics. they usually grow slowly at their optimal temperature and fermentation of industrial strains in a large scale often takes a long time, consuming more energy and materials than some other bacterial industrial strains . most thermophilic streptomyces species grow fast, but no gene cloning systems have been developed in such strains.


RESULTS
we report here the isolation of  <dig> fast-growing , moderately thermophilic  streptomyces strains, detection of one linear and three circular plasmids in them, and sequencing of a 6996-bp plasmid, ptsc <dig>  from one of them. ptsc1-derived pcwh <dig> could replicate in both thermophilic and mesophilic streptomyces strains. on the other hand, several streptomyces replicons function in thermophilic streptomyces species. by examining ten well-sporulating strains, we found two promising cloning hosts, 2c and 4f. a gene cloning system was established by using the two strains. the actinorhodin and anthramycin biosynthetic gene clusters from mesophilic s. coelicolor a <dig> and thermophilic s. refuineus were heterologously expressed in one of the hosts.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a gene cloning and expression system in a fast-growing and moderately thermophilic streptomyces species. although just a few plasmids and one antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster from mesophilic streptomyces were successfully expressed in thermophilic streptomyces species, we expect that by utilizing thermophilic streptomyces-specific promoters, more genes and especially antibiotic genes clusters of mesophilic streptomyces should be heterologously expressed.
