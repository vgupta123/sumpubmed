BACKGROUND
the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster consists of three genes, dhrs <dig>  dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig>  among them, dhrs <dig> encodes nadp-dependent retinol dehydrogenase/reductase. in a previous study, we investigated the alternative splicing of dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig>  dhrs4l <dig> was added to the gene cluster recently, but little is known about its structure and expression. to reveal the regulatory mechanism of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster expression, we studied the structure and transcription of dhrs4l <dig> in the context of the transcriptional behaviors of the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster. based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, we propose a possible mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster.


RESULTS
the homologous comparison analysis suggests that dhrs <dig>  dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> are three homologous genes in human. dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> are paralogues of dhrs <dig>  and dhrs4l <dig> is the most recent member of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster. in the minus strand of the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster, a gene transcribed in an antisense direction was found containing a 5' sequence overlapping the region of exon  <dig> and promoter of dhrs <dig>  by cloning the full length of rna variants through 5'race and 3'race, we identified two transcription start sites, within exon a <dig> and exon  <dig>  of this newly named gene dhrs4l <dig> using neuroblastoma cell line be-m <dig>  analysis of exon composition in the transcripts of dhrs <dig> gene cluster revealed that exon  <dig> was absent in all the transcripts initiated from exon a <dig> of dhrs4l <dig> and exon a <dig> of dhrs4l <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
alternatively spliced rna variants are prevalent in the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster. based on the analysis of gene transcripts and bioinformatic prediction, we propose here that antisense transcription may be involved in the transcriptional initiation regulation of dhrs <dig> and in the posttranscriptional splicing of dhrs4l <dig> and drhs4l <dig> for the homologous identity of dhrs <dig> gene cluster. beside the alternative transcriptional start sites, the antisense rna is novel possible factor serving to remove exon  <dig> from the transcripts initiated from exon a <dig> and exon a <dig>
