BACKGROUND
in modern biotechnology, there is a need for pausing cell lines by cold storage to adapt large-scale cell cultures to the variable demand for their products. we compared various cell culture media/solutions for cold storage of vero-b <dig> kidney cells, a cell line widely used in biotechnology.


RESULTS
cold storage in rpmi  <dig> medium, a recommended cell culture medium for vero-b <dig> cells, surprisingly, strongly enhanced cold-induced cell injury in these cells in comparison to cold storage in krebs-henseleit buffer or other cell culture media . manufacturer, batch, medium supplements and the most likely components with concentrations outside the range of the other media/solutions  did not cause this aggravation of cold-induced injury in rpmi  <dig>  however, a modified krebs-henseleit buffer with a low calcium concentration , a high concentration of inorganic phosphate , and glucose  evoked a cell injury and loss of metabolic function corresponding to that observed in rpmi  <dig>  deferoxamine improved cell survival and preserved metabolic function in modified krebs-henseleit buffer as well as in rpmi  <dig>  similar ca2+ and phosphate concentrations did not increase cold-induced cell injury in the kidney cell line llc-pk <dig>  porcine aortic endothelial cells or rat hepatocytes. however, more extreme conditions  also increased cold-induced injury in rat hepatocytes and porcine aortic endothelial cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that the combination of low calcium and high phosphate concentrations in the presence of glucose enhances cold-induced, iron-dependent injury drastically in vero-b <dig> cells, and that a tendency for this pathomechanism also exists in other cell types.
