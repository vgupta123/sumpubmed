BACKGROUND
an important role in the evolution of intracellular trafficking machinery in eukaryotes played small gtpases belonging to the rab family known as pivotal regulators of vesicle docking, fusion and transport. the rab family is very diversified and divided into several specialized subfamilies. we focused on the vii functional group comprising rab <dig> and rab <dig>  two related subfamilies, and analysed  <dig> sequences of these proteins. rab <dig> regulates traffic from early to late endosomes and from late endosome to vacuole/lysosome, whereas rab <dig> participates in transport from late endosomes to the trans-golgi network.


RESULTS
although rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins are quite small and show heterogeneous rates of substitution in different lineages, we found a phylogenetic signal and inferred evolutionary relationships between them. rab <dig> proteins evolved before radiation of main eukaryotic supergroups while rab <dig> gtpases diverged from rab <dig> before split of choanoflagellates and metazoans. additional duplication of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins resulting in several isoforms occurred in the early evolution of vertebrates and next in teleost fishes and tetrapods. three rab <dig> lineages emerged before divergence of monocots and eudicots and subsequent duplications of rab <dig> genes occurred in particular angiosperm clades. interestingly, several rab <dig> copies were identified in some representatives of excavates, ciliates and amoebozoans. the presence of many rab copies is correlated with significant differences in their expression level. the diversification of analysed rab subfamilies is also manifested by non-conserved sequences and structural features, many of which are involved in the interaction with regulators and effectors. individual sites discriminating different subgroups of rab <dig> and rab <dig> gtpases have been identified.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic reconstructions of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins were performed by a variety of methods. these rab gtpases show diversification both at the phylogenetic, expression and structural levels. the presence of many rab <dig> and rab <dig> isoforms suggests their functional specialization and complexity of subcellular trafficking even in unicellular eukaryotes. the identified less conserved regions in analysed rab sequences may directly contribute to such a differentiation.
