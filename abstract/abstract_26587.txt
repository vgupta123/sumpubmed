BACKGROUND
polar overdominance at the ovine callipyge  locus involves the post-transcriptional trans-inhibition of dlk <dig> in skeletal muscle of clpg/clpg sheep. the abundant maternally expressed micrornas  mapping to the imprinted dlk1-gtl <dig> domain are prime candidate mediators of this trans-effect.


RESULTS
we have tested the affinity of  <dig> mirnas processed from this locus for dlk <dig> by co-transfecting cos <dig> cells with a vector expressing the full-length ovine dlk <dig> with corresponding mimic mirnas. none of the tested mirnas was able to down regulate dlk <dig> to the extent observed in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
this suggests that other factors, with or without these mirnas, are involved in mediating the observed trans-effect.
