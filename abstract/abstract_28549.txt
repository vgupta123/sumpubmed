BACKGROUND
the maternally expressed gene  family is a locally-duplicated gene family of maize which encodes cysteine-rich proteins . the founding member of the family, meg <dig>  is required for normal development of the basal endosperm transfer cell layer  and is involved in the allocation of maternal nutrients to growing seeds. despite the important roles of meg <dig> in maize seed development, the evolutionary history of the meg cluster and the activities of the duplicate genes are not understood.


RESULTS
in maize, the meg gene cluster resides in a  <dig>  mb-long genomic region that exhibits many features of non-centromeric heterochromatin. using phylogenetic reconstruction and syntenic alignments, we identified the pedigree of the meg family, in which  <dig> of its  <dig> members arose in maize after allotetraploidization ~ <dig>  mya. phylogenetic and population-genetic analyses identified possible signatures suggesting recent positive selection in meg homologs. structural analyses of the meg proteins indicated potentially adaptive changes in secondary structure from α-helix to β-strand during the expansion. transcriptomic analysis of the maize endosperm indicated that  <dig> meg genes are selectively activated in the betl, and younger meg genes are more active than older ones. in endosperms from b <dig> by mo <dig> reciprocal crosses, most meg genes did not display parent-specific expression patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
recently-duplicated meg genes have different protein secondary structures, and their expressions in the betl dominate over those of older members. together with the signs of positive selections in the young meg genes, these results suggest that the expansion of the meg family involves potentially adaptive transitions in which new members with novel functions prevailed over older members.
