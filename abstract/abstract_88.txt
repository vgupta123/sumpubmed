BACKGROUND
a substantial body of evidence indicates that reduced plasma adiponectin levels may be key in the development of insulin resistance, type  <dig> diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. glucocorticoids decrease the levels of adiponectin in animals and humans. cortisone is transformed to its active form cortisol, via 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  type  <dig>  this study sought to ascertain if inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> with a new selective inhibitor, bvt <dig>  affects the concentrations of circulating adiponectin with concomitant effects on glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice.


RESULTS
kkay mice were treated with bvt <dig> , rosiglitazone  or vehicle once daily for ten days. plasma adiponectin levels rose in mice treated with bvt <dig> and this was found to be both the hexameric and the high molecular weight multimeric forms of adiponectin. seven days of treatment with the 11β hsd1-inhibitor bvt <dig> decreased basal insulin levels but no changes in glucose tolerance were seen. after ten days of treatment, fasting blood glucose level was decreased by bvt <dig> comparable to the effects of rosiglitazone. another 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor, bvt <dig>  improved hba1c but had no effect on adiponectin.


CONCLUSIONS
inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> can be expected to be beneficial for treating the pathology of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus. the differences seen in adiponectin between bvt <dig> and bvt <dig> could be explained by different pharmacodynamics exerted by the compounds in different tissues in the body. increases in adiponectin concentrations may be an integral component in the mechanism of action of this new11β hsd <dig> inhibitor and may be a useful marker of efficacy during the clinical development of 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor compounds.
