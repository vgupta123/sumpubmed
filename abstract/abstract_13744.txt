BACKGROUND
pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci , which is the pathogen responsible for tobacco wildfire disease, has received considerable attention in recent years. the objective of this study was to clarify the responses of photosystem i  and photosystem ii  to pst infection in tobacco leaves.


RESULTS
the net photosynthetic rate  and carboxylation efficiency  were inhibited by pst infection. the normalized relative variable fluorescence at the k step  and the relative variable fluorescence at the j step  increased while the maximal quantum yield of psii  and the density of qa-reducing psii reaction centers per cross section  decreased, indicating that the reaction centers, and the donor and acceptor sides of psii were all severely damaged after pst infection. the psi activity decreased as the infection progressed. furthermore, we observed a considerable overall degradation of psbo, d <dig>  psaa proteins and an over-accumulation of reactive oxygen species .


CONCLUSIONS
photoinhibition and photoinhibition-like damage were observed under light and dark conditions, respectively, after pst infection of tobacco leaves. the damage was greater in the dark. ros over-accumulation was not the primary cause of the photoinhibition and photoinhibition-like damage. the psbo, d <dig> and psaa proteins appear to be the targets during pst infection under light and dark conditions.
