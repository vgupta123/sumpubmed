BACKGROUND
ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome  is an iatrogenic complication associated with fertility drugs. it is characterized by increased vascular permeability and substantial fluid shift with accumulation in the body cavity. the pathogenesis of ohss remains obscure, and no definitive treatments are currently available.


RESULTS
using western blot and short-circuit current  techniques, we investigate the potential coactions of analysis in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  and aquaporin  <dig>  on the hyper permeability of body cavity peritoneal epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of ohss. the rats develop ohss symptoms, with the up regulation of both cftr and aqp <dig> expression and enhanced cftr channel activity in peritoneal epithelial cells, can also be mimicked by administration of estrogen, alone in ovariectomized rats. administration of progesterone suppresses cftr activity, ohss symptoms as well as cftr and aqp <dig> expression. besides, aqp <dig> inhibitor, hgcl <dig>  can suppress cftr channel activity. therefore, antisera against cftr or aqp <dig> to ohss animals may result in alleviation of the symptom.


CONCLUSIONS
this study confirms the coactions of cftr and aqp <dig> play a critical role in the development and progression of increased peritoneal epithelial permeability in severe ohss. these findings may provide grounds for ameliorating assisted reproduction treatment strategy to reduce the risk of ohss in in vitro fertilization .
