BACKGROUND
growing compelling evidence from clinical and preclinical studies has demonstrated the primary role of alterations of glutamatergic transmission in cortical and limbic areas in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. chronic antidepressants have been shown to dampen endogenous glutamate release from rat hippocampal synaptic terminals and to prevent the marked increase of glutamate overflow induced by acute behavioral stress in frontal/prefrontal cortex. agomelatine, a new antidepressant endowed with mt1/mt <dig> agonist and 5-ht2c serotonergic antagonist properties, has shown efficacy at both preclinical and clinical levels.


RESULTS
chronic treatment with agomelatine, or with the reference drug venlafaxine, induced a marked decrease of depolarization-evoked endogenous glutamate release from purified hippocampal synaptic terminals in superfusion. no changes were observed in gaba release. this effect was accompanied by reduced accumulation of snare protein complexes, the key molecular effector of vesicle docking, priming and fusion at presynaptic membranes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that the novel antidepressant agomelatine share with other classes of antidepressants the ability to modulate glutamatergic transmission in hippocampus. its action seems to be mediated by molecular mechanisms located on the presynaptic membrane and related with the size of the vesicle pool ready for release.
