BACKGROUND
knowledge of the origins, distribution, and inheritance of variation in the malaria parasite  genome is crucial for understanding its evolution; however the 81%  genome poses challenges to high-throughput sequencing technologies. we explore the viability of the roche  <dig> genome sequencer flx  high throughput sequencing technology for both whole genome sequencing and fine-resolution characterization of genetic exchange in malaria parasites.


RESULTS
we present a scheme to survey recombination in the haploid stage genomes of two sibling parasite clones, using whole genome pyrosequencing that includes a sliding window approach to predict recombination breakpoints. whole genome shotgun  sequencing generated approximately  <dig> million reads, with an average read length of approximately  <dig> bp. de novo assembly using a combination of wgs and  <dig> kb paired end libraries resulted in contigs ≤  <dig> kb. more than  <dig>  of the  <dig>  snp markers identified between parents were genotyped in the progeny, resulting in a marker density of approximately  <dig> marker/ <dig>  kb and allowing for the detection of previously unrecognized crossovers  and many non crossover  gene conversions throughout the genome.


CONCLUSIONS
by sequencing the  <dig> mb genomes of two haploid progeny clones derived from a genetic cross at more than 30× coverage, we captured high resolution information on cos, ncos and genetic variation within the progeny genomes. this study is the first to resequence progeny clones to examine fine structure of cos and ncos in malaria parasites.
