BACKGROUND
id proteins are dominant negative inhibitors of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that have multiple functions during development and cellular differentiation. ectopic expression of id <dig> extends the lifespan of primary human epithelial cells. high expression levels of id <dig> have been detected in multiple human malignancies, and in some have been correlated with unfavorable clinical prognosis. id <dig> protein is localized at the centrosomes and forced expression of id <dig> results in errors during centrosome duplication.


RESULTS
here we analyzed the steady state expression levels of the four id-proteins in  <dig> tumor cell lines and assessed the number of centrosome abnormalities. while expression of id <dig>  id <dig>  and id <dig> was detected, we failed to detect protein expression of id <dig>  expression of id <dig> correlated with increased supernumerary centrosomes in most cell lines analyzed.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report that shows that not only ectopic expression in tissue culture but endogenous levels of id <dig> modulate centrosome numbers. thus, our findings support the hypothesis that id <dig> interferes with centrosome homeostasis, most likely contributing to genomic instability and associated tumor aggressiveness.
