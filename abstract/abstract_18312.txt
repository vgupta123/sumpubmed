BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle differentiation requires assembly of contractile proteins into organized myofibrils. the drosophila ladybird homeobox gene  functions in founder cells of the segmental border muscle to promote myoblast fusion and muscle shaping. tetrapods have two homologous genes . lbx <dig> functions in migration and/or proliferation of hypaxial myoblasts, whereas the function of lbx <dig> is poorly understood.


RESULTS
to elucidate the role of lbx in vertebrate myogenesis, we examined lbx function in zebrafish. zebrafish lbx <dig> transcripts appear in newly formed paraxial mesoderm and become restricted to adaxial cells, precursors of slow muscle. slow muscles lose lbx <dig> expression as they differentiate, while a subset of differentiating fast muscle cells transiently expresses lbx <dig>  fin and hyoid muscle express lbx <dig> later. in contrast, lbx1b expression first appears lateral to the somites at late segmentation stages and is later restricted to fin muscle. morpholino knockdown of lbx1b and lbx <dig> suppresses hypaxial muscle development. moreover, knockdown of lbx <dig> results in malformation of muscle fibers and reduced fusion of fast precursors, although no obvious effects on induction or specification are observed. expression of myofilament genes, including actin and myosin, requires the engrailed repressor domain of lbx <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results elucidate a new function of lbx <dig> as a regulator of myofibril formation.
