BACKGROUND
caseous lymphadenitis , caused by corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, is one of the most important diseases of sheep and goats, causing considerable economic losses for herd owners.


RESULTS
we assessed the seroprevalence of infection with c. pseudotuberculosis in  <dig> sheep from  <dig> sheep farms that supply slaughterhouses in the state of minas gerais; we also analyzed management practices that could be associated with cla occurrence, used on these and nearby farms that also supplied animals to the slaughterhouse . the serum samples for assaying cla infection were taken at the slaughterhouse. frequency of infection with c. pseudotuberculosis was estimated at  <dig> %, and farm frequency was estimated at 100%. management practices were analyzed through a questionnaire. all farmers  had extensive/semi-extensive rearing system;  <dig> %  identified sheep individually;  <dig> %  had periodical technical assistance;  <dig> %  disinfected the facilities;  <dig> %  used barbed wire fences and did not implement adequate cla control measures; only  <dig> %  of breeders reported vaccination against c. pseudotuberculosis;  <dig> %  took note of animals with clinical signs of cla;  <dig> %  opened and sanitized abscesses, and isolated the infected animals;  <dig> %  knew the zoonotic potential of this disease and  <dig> %  of the farmers culled animals in case of recurrence of abscesses.


CONCLUSIONS
it can be concluded that c. pseudotuberculosis infection is widely spread in sheep flocks in minas gerais state in brazil and that there is a lack of good management measures and vaccination, allowing transmission of this infectious agent throughout the production network.
