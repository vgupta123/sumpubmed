BACKGROUND
sterol glycosyltransferases  are ubiquitous but one of the most diverse group of enzymes of glycosyltransferases family. members of this family modulate physical and chemical properties of secondary plant products important for various physiological processes. the role of sgts has been demonstrated in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important molecules of medicinal plants like withania somnifera.


RESULTS
analysis suggested conserved behaviour and high similarity in active sites of wssgts with other plant gts. substrate specificity of wssgts were analysed through docking performance of wssgts with different substrates . best docking results of wssgtl <dig> in the form of stable enzyme-substrate complex having lowest binding energies were obtained with brassicasterol, transandrosteron and wssgtl <dig> with solasodine, stigmasterol and 24-methylene cholesterol.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals topological characters and conserved nature of two sgts from w. somnifera  i.e. wssgtl <dig> and wssgtl <dig>  however, besides being ubiquitous in nature and with broad substrate specificity, difference between wssgtl <dig> and wssgtl <dig> is briefly described by difference in stability  of enzyme-substrate complexes through comparative docking.
