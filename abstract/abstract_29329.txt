BACKGROUND
phase-locked gamma oscillations have so far mainly been described in relation to perceptual processes such as sensation, attention or memory matching. due to its very short latency  such oscillations are a plausible candidate for very rapid integration of sensory and motor processes.


RESULTS
we measured eeg in  <dig> healthy participants in a speeded reaction task. participants had to press a button as fast as possible whenever a visual stimulus was presented. the stimulus was always identical and did not have to be discriminated from other possible stimuli. in trials in which the participants showed a fast response, a slow negative potential over central electrodes starting approximately  <dig> ms before the response and highly phase-locked gamma oscillations over central and posterior electrodes between  <dig> and  <dig> ms after the stimulus were observed. in trials in which the participants showed a slow response, no slow negative potential was observed and phase-locked gamma oscillations were significantly reduced. furthermore, for slow response trials the phase-locked gamma oscillations were significantly delayed with respect to fast response trials.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate the relevance of phase-locked gamma oscillations for very fast  integration processes.
