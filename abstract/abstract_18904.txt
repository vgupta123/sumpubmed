BACKGROUND
in zambia, the presence of bovine tuberculosis in both wild and domestic animals has long been acknowledged and mutual transmission between them has been predicted without any direct evidence. elucidation of the circulating mycobacterium bovis strains at wild and domestic animals interphase area in zambia, where bovine tuberculosis was diagnosed in wildlife seemed to be important.


RESULTS
a pcr identified  <dig> and  <dig> m. bovis isolates from lechwe and cattle, respectively. spoligotype analysis revealed that m. bovis strains from lechwe and cattle in kafue basin clustered into a major node sb <dig>  where isolates outside the kafue basin clustered into different nodes of sb <dig> and sb <dig>  the comparatively higher variety of strains in cattle compared to lechwe elucidated by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unitsâ€“variable number tandem repeats analyses are consistent with cattle being the probable source of m. bovis in wild and domestic animals interphase area in zambia.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide strong evidence of m. bovis strains transfer between cattle and lechwe, with the latter having developed into a sylvatic reservoir host.
