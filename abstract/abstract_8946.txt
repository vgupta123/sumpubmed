BACKGROUND
molecular marker-assisted breeding provides an efficient tool to develop improved crop varieties. a major challenge for the broad application of markers in marker-assisted selection is that the marker phenotypes must match plant phenotypes in a wide range of breeding germplasm. in this study, we used the legume crop species lupinus angustifolius  to demonstrate the utility of whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing on the development of diagnostic markers for molecular plant breeding.


RESULTS
nine lupin cultivars released in australia from  <dig> to  <dig> were subjected to whole genome re-sequencing. the re-sequencing data together with the reference genome sequence data were used in marker development, which revealed  <dig>  to  <dig>  snp markers from pairwise comparisons among the cultivars. a total of  <dig>  markers were anchored on the lupin genetic linkage map. marker mining obtained an average of  <dig> snp markers and  <dig> indel markers for each of the  <dig> genome sequence assembly scaffolds bearing markers linked to  <dig> genes of agronomic interest. using the r gene phtjr conferring resistance to phomopsis stem blight disease as a test case, we discovered  <dig> candidate diagnostic markers by genotyping and selecting markers on a genetic linkage map. a further  <dig> candidate diagnostic markers were discovered by marker mining on a scaffold bearing non-diagnostic markers linked to the phtjr gene. nine out from the ten tested candidate diagnostic markers were confirmed as truly diagnostic on a broad range of commercial cultivars. markers developed using these strategies meet the requirements for broad application in molecular plant breeding.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that low-cost genome sequencing and re-sequencing data were sufficient and very effective in the development of diagnostic markers for marker-assisted selection. the strategies used in this study may be applied to any trait or plant species. whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing provides a powerful tool to overcome current limitations in molecular plant breeding, which will enable plant breeders to precisely pyramid favourable genes to develop super crop varieties to meet future food demands.
