BACKGROUND
as a result of successful pmtct programs, children born from hiv-infected mothers are now effectively protected from contracting the infection. however, it is not well known whether in utero exposure to the virus and the subsequent exposure to cotrimoxazole  prophylaxis affect the cell mediated immune system of the children. this observational prospective study was aimed at determining how cd4+ t, cd8+ t and b cell subsets varied in hiv-exposed but uninfected  children at different ages.

methods
we recruited heu and hiv-unexposed and uninfected  children from 6 months of age and followed them up until they were 18 months old. heu children received daily ctx prophylaxis beginning at 6 weeks of age until when 12 months of age. venous blood samples were collected  <dig> monthly and analysed for different subsets of cd8+ t, b cells and totalcd4+ t cells.


RESULTS
at 6 months of age, heu children had a lower percentage of total cd4+ t cells compared to huu children and a lower proportion of naïve cd8+ t cells but higher percentage of effector memory cd8+ t cells compared to huu children. heu and huu children had similar proportions of all b cell subsets at all ages.


CONCLUSIONS
the study showed that the subtle variations in cd4+ and cd8+ t cell subsets observed at 6 months do not last beyond 12 months of age, suggesting that heu children have a robust cell-mediated immune system during first year of life.
