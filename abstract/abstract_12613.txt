BACKGROUND
scientists routinely scan dna sequences for transcription factor  binding
sites . most of the available tools rely on position-specific scoring
matrices  constructed from aligned binding sites. because of the
resolutions of assays used to obtain tfbss, databases such as transfac,
oreganno and pazar store unaligned variable-length dna segments containing
binding sites of a tf. these dna segments need to be aligned to build a
pssm. while the transfac database provides scoring matrices for tfs, nearly
78% of the tfs in the public release do not have matrices available. as work
on tfbs alignment algorithms has been limited, it is highly desirable to
have an alignment algorithm tailored to tfbss.


RESULTS
we designed a novel algorithm named lasagna, which is aware of the lengths of
input tfbss and utilizes position dependence. results on  <dig> tfs of 5
species in the transfac database showed that our method significantly
outperformed clustalw <dig> and meme. we further compared a pssm method dependent
on lasagna to an alignment-free tfbs search method. results on  <dig> tfs whose
binding sites can be located in genomes showed that our method is
significantly more precise at fixed recall rates. finally, we described
lasagna-chip, a more sophisticated version for chip  experiments. under the one-per-sequence model, it
showed comparable performance with meme in discovering motifs in chip-seq
peak sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the lasagna algorithm is simple and effective in aligning
variable-length binding sites. it has been integrated into a user-friendly
webtool for tfbs search and visualization called lasagna-search. the tool
currently stores precomputed pssm models for  <dig> tfs and  <dig> tfs built from
tfbss in the transfac public database  and the oreganno
database , respectively. the webtool is available at
