BACKGROUND
in recent years, the damage caused by bacterial pathogens to major crops has been increasing worldwide. pseudomonas syringae is a widespread bacterial species that infects almost all major crops. different p. syringae strains use a wide range of biochemical mechanisms, including phytotoxins and effectors of the type iii and type iv secretion systems, which determine the specific nature of the pathogen virulence.


RESULTS
strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  were selected for sequencing because they specialize on different groups of plants. we compared virulence factors in these and other available genomes of phylogroup  <dig> to find genes responsible for the specialization of bacteria. we showed that strain  <dig> belongs to the clonal group that has been infecting monocots in russia and usa for a long time . strain  <dig> has relatively recently changed its host plant to dicots.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained by comparing the strain  <dig> genome with the genomes of bacteria infecting monocots can help to identify the genes that define specific nature of the virulence of p. syringae strains.
