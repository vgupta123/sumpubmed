BACKGROUND
fully isogenic lines in fish can be developed using “mitotic” gynogenesis . however, genome-wide verification of the steps in this process has seldom been applied. we used ddradseq to generate snp markers in a meiotic gynogenetic family of european seabass :  to verify the lack of paternal contribution in a meiotic gynogenetic family;  to generate a gene-centromere map from this family;  to identify telomeric markers that could distinguish mitotic gynogenetics from meiotic gynogenetics, which sometimes arise spontaneously in mitotic gynogenetic families.


RESULTS
from a single meiotic gynogenetic family consisting of  <dig> progeny,  <dig> million sequencing reads  resolved  <dig> unique rad-tags. the  <dig> male-informative snp markers that were identified confirmed the lack of paternal contribution. a gene-centromere map was constructed based on  <dig> female-informative snps in  <dig> linkage groups  with a total length of  <dig>  cm . chromosome arm structure could be clearly discerned from the pattern of heterozygosity in each linkage group in  <dig> out of  <dig> lgs: the other six showed anomalies that appeared to be related to issues in the genome assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide screening enabled substantive verification of the production of the gynogenetic family used in this study. the large number of telomeric and subtelomeric markers with high heterozygosity values in the meiotic gynogenetic family indicate that such markers could be used to clearly distinguish between meiotic and mitotic gynogenetics.
