BACKGROUND
y-chromosomal haplogroup  q is suggested to originate in asia and represent recent founder paternal native american radiation into the americas. this group is delineated into q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> subgroups defined by biallelic markers m <dig>  m25/m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively. recently, a novel subgroup q <dig> has been identified which is defined by bi-allelic marker m <dig>  representing hg q  in indian population. with scanty details of hg q in asia, especially india, it was pertinent to explore the status of the y-hg q in indian population to gather an insight to determine the extent of diversity within this region.


RESULTS
we observed 15/ <dig>  y-hg q individuals in india with an ancestral state at m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> markers, indicating an absence of already known q <dig>  q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> sub-haplogroups. interestingly, we further observed a novel  <dig> bp deletion/insertion polymorphism  at  <dig>  position of human arylsulfatase d pseudogene, defining a novel sub-lineage q <dig>  with distributions independent of the social, cultural, linguistic and geographical affiliations in india.


CONCLUSIONS
the study adds another sublineage q <dig> in the already existing arrangement of y-hg q in literature. it was quite interesting to observe an ancestral state q* and a novel sub-branch q <dig>  not reported elsewhere, in indian subcontinent, though in low frequency. a novel subgroup q <dig> was identified recently which is also restricted to indian subcontinent. the most plausible explanation for these observations could be an ancestral migration of individuals bearing ancestral lineage q* to indian subcontinent followed by an autochthonous differentiation to q <dig> and q <dig> sublineages later on. however, other explanations of, either the presence of both the sub haplogroups  in ancestral migrants or recent migrations from central asia, cannot be ruled out till the distribution and diversity of these subgroups is explored extensively in central asia and other regions.
