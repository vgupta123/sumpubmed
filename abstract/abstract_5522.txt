BACKGROUND

pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  <dig> was isolated from a hospital blood specimen in  <dig> and has been widely used as a model strain to survey antibiotics susceptibilities, biofilm development, and metabolic activities of pseudomonas spp.. although four draft genomes of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> have been sequenced, the complete genome of this strain is still lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its physiology and functional genome.


RESULTS
here we sequenced and assembled the complete genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> using the pacific biosciences smrt  technology and illumina sequencing platform. we found that accessory genes of atcc  <dig> including prophages and genomic islands  mainly contribute to the difference between p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and other p. aeruginosa strains. seven prophages were identified within the genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  of the predicted  <dig> gis, three contain genes that encode monoxoygenases, dioxygenases and hydrolases that could be involved in the metabolism of aromatic compounds. surveying virulence-related genes revealed that a series of genes that encode the b-band o-antigen of lps are lacking in atcc  <dig>  distinctive snps in genes of cellular adhesion proteins such as type iv pili and flagella biosynthesis were also observed in this strain. colony morphology analysis confirmed an enhanced biofilm formation capability of atcc  <dig> on solid agar surface compared to pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig>  we then performed transcriptome analysis of atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> using rna-seq and compared the expression of orthologous genes to understand the functional genome and the genomic details underlying the distinctive colony morphogenesis. these analyses revealed an increased expression of genes involved in cellular adhesion and biofilm maturation such as type iv pili, exopolysaccharide and electron transport chain components in atcc  <dig> compared with pao <dig>  in addition, distinctive expression profiles of the virulence genes leca, lasb, quorum sensing regulators lasi/r, and the type i, iii and vi secretion systems were observed in the two strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome sequence of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> reveals the comprehensive genetic background of the strain, and provides genetic basis for several interesting findings about the functions of surface associated proteins, prophages, and genomic islands. comparative transcriptome analysis of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> revealed several classes of differentially expressed genes in the two strains, underlying the genetic and molecular details of several known and yet to be explored morphological and physiological potentials of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>
