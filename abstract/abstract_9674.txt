BACKGROUND
while traditional models of alzheimer's disease focused on large fibrillar deposits of the aβ <dig> amyloid peptide in the brain, recent work suggests that the major pathogenic effects may be attributed to sds-stable oligomers of aβ <dig>  these aβ <dig> oligomers represent a rational target for therapeutic intervention, yet factors governing their assembly are poorly understood.


RESULTS
we describe a new yeast model system focused on the initial stages of aβ <dig> oligomerization. we show that the activity of a fusion of aβ <dig> to a reporter protein is compromised in yeast by the formation of sds-stable low-n oligomers. these oligomers are reminiscent of the low-n oligomers formed by the aβ <dig> peptide in vitro, in mammalian cell culture, and in the human brain. point mutations previously shown to inhibit aβ <dig> aggregation in vitro, were made in the aβ <dig> portion of the fusion protein. these mutations both inhibited oligomerization and restored activity to the fusion protein. using this model system, we found that oligomerization of the fusion protein is stimulated by millimolar concentrations of the yeast prion curing agent guanidine. surprisingly, deletion of the chaperone hsp <dig>  inhibited oligomerization of the fusion protein. furthermore, we demonstrate that hsp <dig> interacts with the aβ42-fusion protein and appears to protect it from disaggregation and degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
previous models of alzheimer's disease focused on unravelling compounds that inhibit fibrillization of aβ <dig>  i.e. the last step of aβ <dig> assembly. however, inhibition of fibrillization may lead to the accumulation of toxic oligomers of aβ <dig>  the model described here can be used to search for and test proteinacious or chemical compounds for their ability to interfere with the initial steps of aβ <dig> oligomerization. our findings suggest that yeast contain guanidine-sensitive factor that reduce the amount of low-n oligomers of aβ <dig>  as many yeast proteins have human homologs, identification of these factors may help to uncover homologous proteins that affect aβ <dig> oligomerization in mammals.
