BACKGROUND
vars/vara is one of the global factors regulating diverse aspects of the metabolism and virulence of bacteria including pathogenic vibrio spp. an experiment to identify the vars/vara-regulon in v. vulnificus revealed that a putative luxr-type transcriptional regulator was down-regulated in Δvara mutant. to investigate the roles of this regulatory cascade, the target gene regulated by a luxr-regulator was identified and its expression was characterized.


RESULTS
transcriptomic analysis of the mutant deficient in this luxr-type regulator showed that the acsa gene encoding acetyl-coa synthetase was down-regulated. thus, this regulator was named acsr for “regulator of acetyl-coa synthetase”. a putative histidine kinase gene, acss, was located five orfs downstream of the acsr gene. expression of an acsa::luxab transcriptional fusion was decreased in both Δacsr and Δacss mutants. similar to a Δacsa mutant, strains carrying deletions either in acsr or acss grew slowly than wild type in a minimal medium with acetate as a sole carbon source. growth defect of the Δacsr strain in acetate-minimal medium was restored by complementation. to investigate if acsr directly regulates acsa expression, in vitro-gel shift assays were performed using the recombinant acsr and the regulatory region of the acsa gene, showing that acsr specifically bound the upstream region of the acsa orf.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that the vars/vara system plays a role in v. vulnificus metabolism via regulating acsr, which in turn controls acetate metabolism by activating the transcription of the acetyl-coa synthetase gene.
