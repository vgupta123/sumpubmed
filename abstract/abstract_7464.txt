BACKGROUND
parkinson's disease  is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, clinically characterized by impaired motor function. since the etiology of pd is diverse and complex, many researchers have created pd-related research resources. however, resources for brain and pd studies are still lacking. therefore, we have constructed a database of pd-related gene and genetic variations using the substantia nigra  in pd and normal tissues. in addition, we integrated pd-related information from several resources.


RESULTS
we collected the  <dig>  sn expressed sequenced tags  from brain sn normal tissues and pd patients sn tissues using full-cdna library and normalized cdna library construction methods from our previous study. the sn ests were clustered in  <dig>  unigene clusters and assigned in  <dig>  genes. we then found up-regulated  <dig> genes and down-regulated  <dig> genes by comparing normal and pd sn ests frequencies with over  <dig>  cut-off probability of differential expression based on the audic and claverie method. in addition, we integrated disease-related information from public resources. to examine the characteristics of these pd-related genes, we analyzed alternative splicing events, single nucleotide polymorphism  markers located in the gene regions, repeat elements, gene regulation elements, and pathways and protein-protein interaction networks.


CONCLUSIONS
we constructed the pdbase database to capture the pd-related gene, genetic variation, and functional elements. this database contains  <dig>  pd-related genes through ests discovered from human normal and pd patients sn tissues, and through integrating several public resources. pdbase provides the mitochondrion proteins, microrna gene regulation elements, single nucleotide polymorphisms  markers within pd-related gene structures, repeat elements, and pathways and networks with protein-protein interaction information. the pdbase information can aid in understanding the causation of pd. it is available at http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr/pdbase/. supplementary data is available at http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr/pdbase/suppl.jsp
