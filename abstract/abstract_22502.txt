BACKGROUND
although being widespread in the hippocampus, the role tachykinins play in synaptic transmission is unclear. the effect of substance p on field potentials evoked by stimulation of the schaffer collateral-commissural fibres and recorded from the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampal slice were studied.


RESULTS
perfusion of substance p  had no effect on the fepsp or population spike. substance p did however cause a selective reduction in the paired pulse depression of population spikes evoked by paired stimulation at interpulse intervals of 20â€“ <dig> msec. a comparison of the actions of other tachykinin receptor agonists gave an order of potency of substance p > -neurokinin a  > senktide. the effect of substance p was reduced by the neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonist sr <dig>  but not by the neurokinin- <dig> or neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonists, mdl  <dig>  or -neurokinin a .


CONCLUSIONS
the order of potency of the agonists, and the effects of the antagonists, both indicate that the effect of substance p on paired pulse depression is mediated by neurokinin- <dig> receptors.
