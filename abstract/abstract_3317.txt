BACKGROUND
carnation italian ringspot virus  is a positive-strand rna virus that causes massive structural alterations of mitochondria in infected host cells, the most conspicuous being the formation of numerous internal vesicles/spherules that are derived from the mitochondrial outer membrane and serve as the sites for viral rna replication. while the membrane-bound components of the cirv replication complex, including a 36-kd rna-binding protein , are known to be essential for these changes in mitochondrial morphology and are relatively well characterized in terms of their roles in nascent viral rna synthesis, how these proteins are specifically targeted and inserted into mitochondria is poorly defined.


RESULTS
here we report on the molecular signal responsible for sorting p <dig> to the mitochondrial outer membrane. using a combination of gain-of-function assays with portions of p <dig> fused to reporter proteins and domain-swapping assays with p <dig> and another closely-related viral rna-binding protein, p <dig>  that sorts specifically to the peroxisomal boundary membrane, we show that the mitochondrial targeting information in p <dig> resides within its two transmembrane domains  and intervening hydrophilic loop sequence. comprehensive mutational analysis of these regions in p <dig> revealed that the primary targeting determinants are the moderate hydrophobicity of both tmds and the positively-charged face of an amphipathic helix within the intervening loop sequence. we show also using bimolecular fluorescence complementation  that p <dig> interacts with certain components of the translocase complex in the mitochondrial outer membrane , but not with the sorting and assembly machinery .


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide insight to how viruses, such as cirv, exploit specific host-cell protein sorting pathways to facilitate their replication. the characterization of the targeting and insertion of p <dig> into the mitochondrial outer membrane also sheds light on the mechanisms involved in sorting of host-cell membrane proteins to mitochondria, a process that has been largely unexplored in plants.
