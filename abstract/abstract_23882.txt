BACKGROUND
the amino acid composition of a low molecular weight chromium binding peptide , isolated from bovine liver, is reportedly e:g:c:d::4:2:2: <dig>  though its sequence has not been discovered. there is some controversy surrounding the exact biochemical forms and the action of cr in biological systems; the topic has been the subject of many experimental reports and continues to be investigated. clarification of cr-protein interactions will further understanding cr biochemistry and provide a basis for novel therapies based on metallocomplexes or small molecules.


RESULTS
a genomic search of the non-redundant database for all possible decapeptides of the reported composition yields three exact matches, edgeecdcge, dgeecdcgee and ceggceedde. the first two sequences are found in adam  <dig>  proteins in man and mouse; the last is found in a protein kinase in rice . a broader search for pentameric sequences  corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio e:d:g:c::2:1:1: <dig>  within the set of human proteins and the set of proteins in, or related to, the insulin signaling pathway, yields a match at an acidic region in the Î±-subunit of the insulin receptor . a synthetic peptide derived from this sequence binds chromium and forms a metal-peptide complex that has properties matching those reported for isolated lmwcr and cr-containing peptide fractions.


CONCLUSIONS
the search for an acidic decameric sequence indicates that lmwcr may not be a contiguous sequence. the identification of a distinct pentameric sequence in a significant insulin-signaling pathway protein suggests a possible identity for the lmwcr peptide. this identification clarifies directions for further investigation of lmwcr peptide fractions, chromium bio-coordination chemistry and a possible role in the insulin signaling pathway. implications for models of chromium action in the insulin-signaling pathway are discussed.
