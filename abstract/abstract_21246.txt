BACKGROUND
myosins are actin-activated atpases that use energy to generate force and move along actin filaments, dragging with their tails different cargos. plant myosins belong to the group of unconventional myosins and arabidopsis myosin viii gene family contains four members: atm <dig>  atm <dig>  myosin viiia and myosin viiib.


RESULTS
in transgenic plants expressing gfp fusions with atm <dig> , fluorescence was differentially distributed: while in epidermis cells at the root cap gfp-atm <dig> equally distributed all over the cell, in epidermal cells right above this region it accumulated in dots. further up, in cells of the elongation zone, gfp-atm <dig> was preferentially positioned at the sides of transversal cell walls. interestingly, the punctate pattern was insensitive to brefeldin a  while in some cells closer to the root cap, atm <dig> was found in bfa bodies. with the use of different markers and transient expression in nicotiana benthamiana leaves, it was found that myosin viii co-localized to the plasmodesmata and er, colocalized with internalized fm4- <dig>  and partially overlapped with the endosomal markers ara <dig>  and rarely with ara <dig> and fyve. motility of ara <dig> labeled organelles was inhibited whenever associated with truncated atm <dig> but motility of fyve labeled organelles was inhibited only when associated with large excess of atm <dig>  furthermore, gfp-atm <dig> and rfp-atm <dig>  co-localized to the same spots on the plasma membrane, indicating a specific composition at these sites for myosin binding.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data suggest that myosin viii functions differently in different root cells and can be involved in different steps of endocytosis, bfa-sensitive and insensitive pathways, er tethering and plasmodesmatal activity.
