BACKGROUND
macrolide resistant streptococcus pneumoniae has been on a gradual increase in germany for over a decade. the current study was undertaken against the background of the recent observation of declining macrolide resistance rates especially among german children. nationwide surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease has been conducted in germany since  <dig>  a population- and laboratory-based approach was used to collect data on invasive pneumococcal disease, and isolates sent to the national reference center for streptococci by diagnostic microbiological laboratories from  <dig> to  <dig> were included in this study.


RESULTS
from  <dig> to  <dig>  data on macrolide susceptibility were available for  <dig>  invasive isolates.  <dig>  isolates  were from adults , and  <dig>  isolates  from children . the overall nonsusceptibility rate of all isolates was  <dig> % . higher resistance rates were observed among children  than among adults . maximum nonsusceptibility rates during the period under study were observed in  <dig> , while nonsusceptibility rates in  <dig> were considerably lower, especially for children . the rate of resistance was higher among the vaccine serotypes  than among the non vaccine serotypes . serotype  <dig>  proved to be the most resistant serotype.


CONCLUSIONS
there has been a considerable and statistically significant decrease in macrolide nonsusceptibility in germany since  <dig>  especially among children.
