BACKGROUND
fusarium verticillioides causes an important seed disease on maize and produces the fumonisin group of mycotoxins, which are toxic to humans and livestock. a previous study discovered that a gene  in the pathogen affects fumonisin production and virulence. although the predicted amino acid sequence of fst <dig> is similar to hexose transporters, previous experimental evidence failed to prove function.


RESULTS
three new phenotypes were identified that are associated with the fst <dig> mutant of f. verticillioides , namely reduction in macroconidia production, increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and reduced mycelial hydrophobicity. a transcriptome comparison of the wild type and strain Δfst <dig> grown on autoclaved maize kernels for six days identified  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed. through gene ontology analysis,  <dig> genes were assigned to one of  <dig> molecular function categories. sets of down-regulated genes in strain Δfst <dig> were identified that could account for each of the mutant phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
the study provides evidence that disruption of fst <dig> causes several metabolic and developmental defects in f. verticillioides. fst <dig> appears to connect the expression of several gene networks, including those involved in secondary metabolism, cell wall structure, conidiogenesis, virulence, and resistance to reactive oxygen species. the results support our hypothesis that fst <dig> functions within the framework of environmental sensing.
