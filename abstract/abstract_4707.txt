BACKGROUND
plant defensins represent a major innate immune protein superfamily that displays strong inhibitory effects on filamentous fungi. the total number of plant defensins in a conifer species is unknown since there are no sequenced conifer genomes published, however the genomes of several angiosperm species provide an insight on the diversity of plant defensins. here we report the identification of five new defensin-encoding genes from the picea glauca genome and the characterization of two of their gene products, named pgd <dig> and endopiceasin.


RESULTS
screening of a p. glauca est database with sequences of known plant defensins identified four genes with homology to the known p. glauca defensin pgd <dig>  which were designated pgd2- <dig>  whereas in the mature pgd2- <dig> only 7â€“ <dig> amino acids differed from pgd <dig>  pgd <dig> had only 64% sequence identity. pgd <dig> was amplified from p. glauca genomic dna by pcr. it codes for a precursor of 77-amino acid that is fully conserved within the picea genus and has similarity to plant defensins. recombinant pgd <dig>  produced in escherichia coli, had a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, as determined by mass spectrometry. the pgd <dig> peptide exhibited strong antifungal activity against several phytopathogens without any effect on the morphology of the treated fungal hyphae, but strongly inhibited hyphal elongation. a sytox uptake assay suggested that the inhibitory activity of pgd <dig> could be associated with altering the permeability of the fungal membranes. another completely unrelated defensin gene was identified in the est library and named endopiceasin. its gene codes for a 6-cysteine peptide that shares high similarity with the fungal defensin plectasin.


CONCLUSIONS
screening of a p. glauca est database resulted in the identification of five new defensin-encoding genes. pgd <dig> codes for a plant defensin that displays non-morphogenic antifungal activity against the phytopathogens tested, probably by altering membrane permeability. pgd <dig> has potential for application in the plant biotechnology sector. endopiceasin appears to derive from an endo- or epiphytic fungal strain rather than from the plant itself.
