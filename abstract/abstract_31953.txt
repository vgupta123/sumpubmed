BACKGROUND
quantitative descriptions of amino acid similarity, expressed as probabilistic models of evolutionary interchangeability, are central to many mainstream bioinformatic procedures such as sequence alignment, homology searching, and protein structural prediction. here we present a web-based, user-friendly analysis tool that allows any researcher to quickly and easily visualize relationships between these bioinformatic metrics and to explore their relationships to underlying indices of amino acid molecular descriptors.


RESULTS
we demonstrate the three fundamental types of question that our software can address by taking as a specific example the connections between  <dig> measures of amino acid biophysical properties , a generalized model of amino acid substitution , and the mutational distance that separates amino acids within the standard genetic code . we show that our software allows a user to recapture the insights from several key publications on these topics in just a few minutes.


CONCLUSIONS
our software facilitates rapid, interactive exploration of three interconnected topics:  the multidimensional molecular descriptors of the twenty proteinaceous amino acids,  the correlation of these biophysical measurements with observed patterns of amino acid substitution, and  the causal basis for differences between any two observed patterns of amino acid substitution. this software acts as an intuitive bioinformatic exploration tool that can guide more comprehensive statistical analyses relating to a diverse array of specific research questions.
