BACKGROUND
hydroxycamptothecin  has been shown to have activity against a broad spectrum of cancers. in order to enhance its tissue-specific delivery and anticancer activity, we prepared hcpt-loaded nanoparticles made from poly-poly , and then studied their release characteristics, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and anticancer effects. peg-pblg nanoparticles incorporating hcpt were prepared by a dialysis method. scanning electron microscopy  was used to observe the shape and diameter of the nanoparticles. the hcpt release characteristics in vitro were evaluated by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. a high-performance liquid chromatography  detection method for determining hcpt in rabbit plasma was established. the pharmacokinetic parameters of hcpt/peg-pblg nanoparticles were compared with those of hcpt.


RESULTS
the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles had a core-shell spherical structure, with a core diameter of  <dig> nm and a shell thickness of  <dig> nm. drug-loading capacity and drug encapsulation were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. the hcpt release profile was biphasic, with an initial abrupt release, followed by sustained release. the terminal elimination half-lives  of hcpt and hcpt-loaded nanoparticles were  <dig>  and  <dig>  h, respectively. peak concentrations  of hcpt and hcpt-loaded nanoparticles were  <dig>  and  <dig>  Î¼g/l, respectively. the apparent volumes of distribution of the hcpt and hcpt-loaded nanoparticles were  <dig>  and  <dig>  l, respectively. compared with a blank control group, lovo cell xenografts or tca <dig> cell xenografts in hcpt or hcpt-loaded nanoparticle treated groups grew more slowly and the tumor doubling times were increased. the tumor inhibition effect in the hcpt-loaded nanosphere-treated group was significantly higher than that of the hcpt-treated group . tumor inhibition in the control group by peg-pblg nanoparticles was not observed .


CONCLUSIONS
compared to the hcpt- and control-treated groups, the hcpt-loaded nanoparticle-treated group showed a more sustained release, a longer circulation time, increased delivery to tissue, and an enhanced anticancer effect. hcpt-loaded nanoparticles appear to change the pharmacokinetic behavior of hcpt in vivo.
