BACKGROUND
high titers of lentiviral vectors are required for the efficient transduction of a gene of interest. during preparation of lentiviral the vectors, the protein of interest is inevitably expressed in the viral vector-producing cells. this expression may affect the production of the lentiviral vector.

methods
we prepared lentiviral vectors expressing inwardly rectifying potassium channel , its dominant-negative form , and other k+ channels, using the ubiquitously active β-actin and neuron-specific synapsin i promoters.


RESULTS
the titer of lv-kir-dn was higher than that of lv-kir <dig> , suggesting a negative effect of induced k+ currents on viral titer. we then blocked kir <dig>  currents with the selective blocker ba2+ during lv-kir <dig>  production, and obtained about a 5-fold increase in the titer. higher extracellular k+ concentrations increased the titer of lv-kir <dig>  about 9-fold. with a synapsin i promoter ba2+ increased the titer because of the moderate expression of kir <dig>  channel. channel blockade also increased the titers of the lentivirus expressing kv <dig>  and trek channels, but not herg. the increase in titer correlated with the k+ currents generated by the channels expressed.


CONCLUSIONS
in the production of lentivirus expressing k+ channels, titers are increased by blocking k+ currents in the virus-producing cells. this identifies a crucial issue in the production of viruses expressing membrane channels, and should facilitate basic and gene therapeutic research on channelopathies.
