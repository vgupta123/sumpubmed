BACKGROUND
the role of small non-coding micrornas  in several types of cancer has been evident. however, its expression studies have never been performed in gastric cancer  patients from saudi population. first time this study was conducted to identify mirnas that are differentially expressed in gc patients compared with normal controls.

methods
we investigated the role of mirnas in gc patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tissues of  <dig> samples from gc patients  and  <dig> from normal control. we have used mirna microarray analysis and validated the results by real-time quantitative pcr .


RESULTS
we obtained data of  <dig> expressed genes, from cancer tissues and noncancerous tissues . where  <dig> genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> genes  were down-regulated in  <dig> ffpe tissue samples. only  <dig> mirnas had significant expression in early and late-stage cancer tissues. after candidate mirnas were selected, rt-qpcr further confirmed that four mirnas  were significantly aberrant in gc tissues compared to the normal gastric tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we provide mirnas profile of gc where many mirnas showed aberrant expression from normal tissues, suggesting their involvement in the development and progression of gastric cancer. in early and late-stage mir-200c-3p showed significant down regulation as compare to control samples. many of mirnas reported in our study showing up-regulation are new and not reported before may be due to population difference. in conclusion, our results suggest that mir-200c-3p had potential to use as diagnostic biomarker for distinguishing gc patients from normal individuals and can be used for diagnosis of cancer at early stage.
