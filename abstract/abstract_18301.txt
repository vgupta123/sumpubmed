BACKGROUND
the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  on the apoptosis of granulosa cells  in rats.

bmscs and gcs were isolated from rats. gcs were separated into one of the following three groups: an untreated control group , a cisplatin  treatment group , and group co-cultured with bmscs and treated with cisplatin . gc apoptosis was analyzed by annexin v staining and real-time pcr analysis for apoptosis-related genes. the effect of bmscs was also determined in  <dig> to 10 month-old perimenopausal rats that were separated into the following groups: saline control, bmsc transplantation , and estrogen treatment  groups. a young group consisting of  <dig> to 4 month-old rats that were treated with saline was also evaluated as a control. after  <dig> and 3 months, gc apoptosis was evaluated by tunel analysis.


RESULTS
cisplatin increased gc apoptosis from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the control and cisplatin treatment groups, respectively, which was significantly reduced upon co-culture with bmscs to  <dig> %. cisplatin treatment increased p <dig> and bax and decreased c-myc mrna expression, which was reversed upon co-culture with bmscs. as compared to young rats, increased apoptosis was observed in the perimenopausal rats . after 3 months, the apoptosis rate in the bmsc group was significantly lower than that of the control group .


CONCLUSIONS
bmsc therapy may protect against gc apoptosis induced by cisplatin and perimenopause. further studies are necessary to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of bmscs.
