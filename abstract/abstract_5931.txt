BACKGROUND
isla <dig> is a truncated single domain protein derived from the inulosucrase isla, which is a multidomain fructosyltransferase produced by leuconostoc citreum. isla <dig> can synthesize high molecular weight inulin from sucrose, with a residual sucrose hydrolytic activity. isla <dig> has been reported to retain the product specificity of the multidomain enzyme.


RESULTS
screening experiments to evaluate the influence of the reactions conditions, especially the sucrose and enzyme concentrations, on isla <dig> product specificity revealed that high sucrose concentrations shifted the specificity of the reaction towards fructooligosaccharides  synthesis, which almost eliminated inulin synthesis and led to a considerable reduction in sucrose hydrolysis. reactions with low isla <dig> activity and a high sucrose activity allowed for high levels of fos synthesis, where 70% sucrose was used for transfer reactions, with 65% corresponding to transfructosylation for the synthesis of fos.


CONCLUSIONS
domain truncation together with the selection of the appropriate reaction conditions resulted in the synthesis of various fos, which were produced as the main transferase products of inulosucrase . these results therefore demonstrate that bacterial fructosyltransferase could be used for the synthesis of inulin-type fos.
