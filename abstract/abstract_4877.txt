BACKGROUND
the evolution of insecticide resistance and persistence of resistance phenotypes are influenced by the fitness of resistance alleles in the absence of insecticide pressure. experimental determination of fitness is difficult, but fitness can be inferred by measuring changes in allele frequencies in appropriate environments. we conducted allele competition experiments by crossing two highly related strains of culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. one strain  was permethrin resistant  and one was a susceptible strain. allele and genotype frequencies were examined for  <dig> generations under three environmental conditions: standard laboratory, temephos exposure  and cold temperature stress .


RESULTS
a fitness cost was inferred for the p <dig> mechanism in the standard laboratory environment. a greater cost was associated with the temephos exposed environment, suggesting the temephos placed an additional stress on the p <dig> resistant mosquitoes. no observed cost was associated with the p <dig> resistance locus in the cold temperature environment, but there was a significant heterozygote advantage. in all environments the fitness of the resistant homozygotes was the lowest.


CONCLUSIONS
the cytochrome p450-mediated permethrin detoxification resistance in cx. p. quinquefasciatus can have an associated fitness cost in the absence of permethrin, relative to a susceptible allele. the strength of the cost varies depending on the environmental conditions. p450-mediated resistance is expected to decrease over time if the permethrin application is relaxed and to decrease at an even faster rate if permethrin is replaced with temephos. additionally, these results indicate that a p <dig> resistance allele can persist  in colder temperatures and could potentially be carried into the culex pipiens hybrid zone.
