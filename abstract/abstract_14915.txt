BACKGROUND
streptomyces hygroscopicus  <dig> has been used for the production of the antifungal validamycin/jinggangmycin for more than 40 years. a high yield of validamycin is achieved by culturing the strain at 37°c, rather than at 30°c for normal growth and sporulation. the mechanism of its thermo-regulated biosynthesis was largely unknown.


RESULTS
the  <dig> ,684-bp genome of strain  <dig> was completely sequenced and composed of a linear chromosome, a  <dig> -kb linear plasmid, and a  <dig> -kb circular plasmid. compared with other streptomyces genomes, the chromosome of strain  <dig> has a smaller core region and shorter terminal inverted repeats, encodes more α/β hydrolases, major facilitator superfamily transporters, and mg2+/mn2+-dependent regulatory phosphatases. transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression of  <dig> % of coding sequences was increased at 37°c, including biosynthetic genes for validamycin and other three secondary metabolites. at 37°c, a glutamate dehydrogenase was transcriptionally up-regulated, and further proved its involvement in validamycin production by gene replacement. moreover, efficient synthesis and utilization of intracellular glutamate were noticed in strain  <dig> at 37°c, revealing glutamate as the nitrogen source for validamycin biosynthesis. furthermore, a sarp-family regulatory gene with enhanced transcription at 37°c was identified and confirmed to be positively involved in the thermo-regulation of validamycin production by gene inactivation and transcriptional analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
strain  <dig> seemed to have evolved with specific genomic components to facilitate the thermo-regulated validamycin biosynthesis. the data obtained here will facilitate future studies for validamycin yield improvement and industrial bioprocess optimization.
