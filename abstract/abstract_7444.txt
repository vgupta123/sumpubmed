BACKGROUND
datasets generated on deep-sequencing platforms have been deposited in various public repositories such as the gene expression omnibus , sequence read archive  hosted by the ncbi, or the dna data bank of japan . despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.


RESULTS
geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. it is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. the analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. the user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/mirna names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by geoseq. we applied geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mrna-seq datasets, b) identify mirnas  in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in mirnas and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated mirnas. the ease of using geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.
