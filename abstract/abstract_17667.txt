BACKGROUND
in recent years it has become clear that small non-coding rnas function as regulatory elements in bacterial virulence and bacterial stress responses. we tested for the presence of the small non-coding gcvb rnas in y. pestis as possible regulators of gene expression in this organism.


RESULTS
in this study, we report that the yersinia pestis kim <dig> gcvb gene encodes two small rnas. transcription of gcvb is activated by the gcva protein and repressed by the gcvr protein. the gcvb-encoded rnas are required for repression of the y. pestis dppa gene, encoding the periplasmic-binding protein component of the dipeptide transport system, showing that the gcvb rnas have regulatory activity. a deletion of the gcvb gene from the y. pestis kim <dig> chromosome results in a decrease in the generation time of the organism as well as a change in colony morphology.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study indicate that the y. pestis gcvb gene encodes two small non-coding regulatory rnas that repress dppa expression. a gcvb deletion is pleiotropic, suggesting that the srnas are likely involved in controlling genes in addition to dppa.
