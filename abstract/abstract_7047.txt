BACKGROUND
natural killer  cells in the cow have been elusive due to the lack of specific nk cell markers, and various criteria including a cd3-/cd2+ phenotype have been used to identify such cells. the recent characterization of the nk-specific nkp <dig> receptor has allowed a more precise definition of bovine nk cells. nk cells are known as a heterogeneous cell group, and we here report the first functional study of bovine nk cell subsets, based on the expression of cd <dig> 


RESULTS
bovine cd2- nk cells, a minor subset in blood, proliferated more rapidly in the presence of il- <dig>  dominating the cultures after a few days. grown separately with il- <dig>  cd2- and cd2+ nk cell subsets did not change cd <dig> expression for at least two weeks. in blood, cd2- nk cells showed a higher expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig>  consistent with a high activation status. a higher proportion of cd2- nk cells had intracellular interferon-gamma in the cytoplasm in response to il- <dig> and il- <dig> stimulation, and the cd2- subset secreted more interferon-gamma when cultured separately. cytotoxic capacity was similar in both subsets, and both carried transcripts for the nk cell receptors kir, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and klrj. ligation by one out of two tested anti-cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies could trigger interferon-gamma production from nk cells, but neither of them could alter cytotoxicity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide evidence that bovine cd2- as well as cd2+ cells of the nkp46+ phenotype are fully functional nk cells, the cd2- subset showing signs of being more activated in the circulation.
