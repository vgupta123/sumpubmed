BACKGROUND
protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania are causative agents of a diverse spectrum of human diseases collectively known as leishmaniasis. these eukaryotic pathogens that diverged early from the main eukaryotic lineage possess a number of unusual genomic, molecular and biochemical features. the completion of the genome projects for three leishmania species has generated invaluable information enabling a direct analysis of genome structure and organization.


RESULTS
by using dna macroarrays, made with leishmania infantum genomic clones and hybridized with total dna from the parasite, we identified a clone containing a repeated sequence. an analysis of the recently completed genome sequence of l. infantum, using this repeated sequence as bait, led to the identification of a new class of repeated elements that are interspersed along the different l. infantum chromosomes. these elements turned out to be homologues of sider <dig> sequences, which were recently identified in the leishmania major genome; thus, we adopted this nomenclature for the leishmania elements described herein. since sider <dig> elements are very heterogeneous in sequence, their precise identification is rather laborious. we have characterized  <dig> lisider <dig> elements in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> ones in chromosome  <dig>  the mean size for these elements is  <dig> bp and their sequence is g+c rich . on the basis of sequence similarity, these elements can be grouped in subfamilies that show a remarkable relationship of proximity, i.e. sider2s of a given subfamily locate close in a chromosomal region without intercalating elements. for comparative purposes, we have identified the sider <dig> elements existing in l. major and leishmania braziliensis chromosomes  <dig>  while sider <dig> elements are highly conserved both in number and location between l. infantum and l. major, no such conservation exists when comparing with sider2s in l. braziliensis chromosome  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
sider <dig> elements constitute a relevant piece in the leishmania genome organization. sequence characteristics, genomic distribution and evolutionarily conservation of sider2s are suggestive of relevant functions for these elements in leishmania. apart from a proved involvement in post-trancriptional mechanisms of gene regulation, sider <dig> elements could be involved in dna amplification processes and, perhaps, in chromosome segregation as centromeric sequences.
