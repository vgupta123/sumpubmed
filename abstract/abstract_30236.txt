BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes is among the most important foodborne bacterial pathogens due to the high mortality rate and severity of the infection. l. monocytogenes is a ubiquitous organism occasionally present in the intestinal tract of various animal species and faecal shedding by asymptomatically infected livestock poses a risk for contamination of farm environments and raw food at the pre-harvest stages. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and strain diversity of l. monocytogenes in healthy ruminants and swine herds.


RESULTS
faecal samples from  <dig> animals per herd were collected from  <dig> herds  in the basque country and screened in pools by an automated enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay  to estimate the prevalence of positive herds. positive samples were subcultured onto the selective and differential agar aloa and biochemically confirmed. l. monocytogenes was isolated from  <dig> % of dairy cattle,  <dig> % beef cattle and  <dig> % sheep herds, but not from swine. within-herd prevalence investigated by individually analysing  <dig> sheep and  <dig> cattle detected  <dig> % of faecal shedders in sheep and  <dig> % in cattle. serotyping of  <dig> isolates identified complex 4b as the most prevalent , followed by 1/2a , and pfge analysis of  <dig> isolates showed a highly diverse l. monocytogenes population in ruminant herds.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that cattle represent a potentially important reservoir for l. monocytogenes in the basque country, and highlighted the complexity of pathogen control at the farm level.
