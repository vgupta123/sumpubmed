BACKGROUND
among the winged insects  the odonata  are special for several reasons. they are strictly aerial predators showing remarkable flight abilities and their thorax morphology differs significantly from that of other pterygota in terms of the arrangement and number of muscles. even within one individual the musculature is significantly different between the nymphal and adult stage.


RESULTS
here we present a comparative morphological investigation of the thoracic musculature of dragonfly  nymphs. we investigated representatives of the libellulidae, aeshnidae and cordulegasteridae and found  <dig> muscles:  <dig> muscles in the prothorax,  <dig> in the mesothorax and  <dig> in the metathorax. nine of these muscles were previously unknown in odonata, and for seven muscles no homologous muscles could be identified in the neopteran thorax.


CONCLUSIONS
our results support and extend the homology hypotheses for the thoracic musculatures of odonata and neoptera, thus supplementing our understanding of the evolution of pterygota and providing additional characters for phylogenetic analyses comprising all subgroups of pterygota.
