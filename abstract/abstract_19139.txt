BACKGROUND
carnosine  is a putative neurotransmitter and has a possible role in neuron-glia cell interactions. previously, we reported that carnosine induced hyperactivity in chicks when intracerebroventricularly  administered. in the present study, we focused on other β-alanyl dipeptides to determine if they have novel functions.


RESULTS
in experiment  <dig>  i.c.v. injection of β-alanyl-l-leucine, but not β-alanyl-glycine, induced hyperactivity behavior as observed with carnosine. both carnosine and β-alanyl-l-leucine stimulated corticosterone release. thus, dipeptides of β-alanyl-branched chain amino acids were compared in experiment  <dig>  the i.c.v. injection of β-alanyl-l-isoleucine caused a similar response as β-alanyl-l-leucine, but β-alanyl-l-valine was somewhat less effective than the other two dipeptides. β-alanyl-l-leucine strongly stimulated, and the other two dipeptides tended to stimulate, corticosterone release.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that central β-alanyl-branched chain amino acid stimulates activity in chicks through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. we named β-alanyl-l-leucine, β-alanyl-l-isoleucine and β-alanyl-l-valine as excitin- <dig>  excitin- <dig> and excitin- <dig>  respectively.
