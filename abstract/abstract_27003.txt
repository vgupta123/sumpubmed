BACKGROUND
regression of established tumors can be induced by adoptive immunotherapy with tumor draining lymph node lymphocytes activated with bryostatin and ionomycin. we hypothesized that tumor regression is mediated by a subset of the transferred t lymphocytes, which selectively infiltrate the tumor draining lymph nodes and proliferate in vivo.


RESULTS
adoptive transfer of b/i activated tumor draining lymphocytes induces regression of advanced 4t <dig> tumors, and depletion of cd <dig>  but not cd <dig> t cells, abrogated tumor regression in mice. the predominant mediators of tumor regression are cd8+ and derived from cd62l- t cells. transferred lymphocytes reached their peak concentration  in the spleen  <dig> days after adoptive transfer and then rapidly declined. adoptively transferred cells preferentially migrated to and/or proliferated in the tumor draining lymph nodes, peaking at day  <dig>  and remained up to day  <dig>  cfse-stained cells were seen in tumors, also peaking at day  <dig> . bryostatin and ionomycin-activated cells proliferated vigorously in vivo, with  <dig> generations evident in the tumor draining lymph nodes on day  <dig>  cfse-stained cells found in the tumor draining lymph nodes on day  <dig> were 30% cd8+, 72% cd4+, 95% cd44+, and 39% cd69+. pre-treatment of recipient mice with cyclophosphamide dramatically increased the number of interferon-gamma producing cells.


CONCLUSIONS
adoptively transferred cd8+ cd62llow t cells are the principal mediators of tumor regression, and host t cells are not required. these cells infiltrate 4t <dig> tumors, track preferentially to tumor draining lymph nodes, have an activated phenotype, and proliferate in vivo. cyclophosphamide pre-treatment augments the anti-tumor effect by increasing the proliferation of interferon-gamma producing cells in the adoptive host.
