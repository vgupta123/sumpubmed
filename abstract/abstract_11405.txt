BACKGROUND
traumatic injuries can undermine neurological functions and act as risk factors for the development of irreversible and fatal neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . in this study, we have investigated how a mutation of the superoxide dismutase  <dig>  gene, linked to the development of als, modifies the acute response to a gentle mechanical compression of the spinal cord. in a 7-day post-injury time period, we have performed a comparative ontological analysis of the gene expression profiles of injured spinal cords obtained from pre-symptomatic rats over-expressing the g93a-sod <dig> gene mutation and from wild type  littermates.


RESULTS
the steady post-injury functional recovery observed in wt rats was accompanied by the early activation at the epicenter of injury of several growth-promoting signals and by the down-regulation of intermediate neurofilaments and of genes involved in the regulation of ion currents at the  <dig> day post-injury time point. the poor functional recovery observed in g93a-sod <dig> transgenic animals was accompanied by the induction of fewer pro-survival signals, by an early activation of inflammatory markers, of several pro-apoptotic genes involved in cytochrome-c release and by the persistent up-regulation of the heavy neurofilament subunits and of genes involved in membrane excitability. these molecular changes occurred along with a pronounced atrophy of spinal cord motor neurones in the g93a-sod <dig> rats compared to wt littermates after compression injury.


CONCLUSIONS
in an experimental paradigm of mild mechanical trauma which causes no major tissue damage, the g93a-sod <dig> gene mutation alters the balance between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival molecular signals in the spinal cord tissue from the pre-symptomatic rat, leading to a premature activation of molecular pathways implicated in the natural development of als.
