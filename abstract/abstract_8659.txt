BACKGROUND
mites are one of the most common and widely distributed ectoparasites of small ruminants in ethiopia, contributing to major hindrances in livestock productivity in the country. despite of this fact, specific study was not conducted on mites of small ruminants in ethiopia. therefore, the present study was performed from october  <dig> to may  <dig> to determine the prevalence and species composition of mites in three agroecological zones in north eastern ethiopia. in addition, a questionnaire survey on mites was conducted to assess the control practices and awareness of farmers in the study areas.


RESULTS
out of a total of  <dig> sheep and  <dig> goats examined,  <dig> of sheep and  <dig> goats were infested with one or more species of mites. in goats an overall prevalence of  <dig>  % sarcoptes,  <dig>  % demodex and  <dig>  % psoroptes were recorded whereas in sheep an overall prevalence of  <dig>  % sarcoptes,  <dig>  % demodex and  <dig>  % psoroptes were observed. sarcoptes  and demodex  were significantly more common in young than in adult sheep. demodectic mange was significantly higher in young  compared to adult  goats . significantly higher  overall prevalence of sarcoptic and demodectic mites in both sheep and goats with poor than with good body condition was recorded. results of the questionnaire survey supported results of our cross-sectional study.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates high prevalence of mange mites in sheep and goats of the study area. the study revealed that sarcoptes is the predominant mite in both sheep and goats. animal owners and veterinarians should consider mite control in small ruminants as part of the routine ectoparasite control in ethiopia.
