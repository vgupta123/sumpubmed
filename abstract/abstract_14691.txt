BACKGROUND
genome wide analysis of variation within a species can reveal the evolution of fundamental biological processes such as mutation, recombination, and natural selection. we compare genome wide sequence differences between two independent isolates of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  and the reference genome .


RESULTS
the base substitution pattern when comparing n <dig> against cb <dig> reveals a transition over transversion bias  that is not present in cb <dig>  in cb <dig>  there is a significant bias in the direction of base substitution. the frequency of a or t bases in n <dig> that are g or c bases in cb <dig> outnumber the opposite frequencies for transitions as well as transversions. these differences were not observed in the n2/cb <dig> comparison. similarly, we observed a strong bias for deletions over insertions in cb <dig>  that is not present in cb <dig>  in both cb <dig> and cb <dig>  there is a significant correlation between snp rate and recombination rate on the autosomes but not on the x chromosome. furthermore, we identified numerous significant hotspots of variation in the cb4856-n <dig> comparison.

in both cb <dig> and cb <dig>  based on a measure of the strength of selection , all the chromosomes are under negative selection and in cb <dig>  there is no difference in the strength of natural selection in either the autosomes versus x or between any of the chromosomes. by contrast, in cb <dig>  ka/ks values are smaller in the autosomes than in the x chromosome. in addition, in cb <dig>  ka/ks values differ between chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the clear bias of deletions over insertions in cb <dig> suggests that either the cb <dig> genome is becoming smaller or the n <dig> genome is getting larger. we hypothesize the hotspots found represent alleles that are shared between cb <dig> and cb <dig> but not n <dig>  because the ka/ks ratio in the x chromosome is higher than the autosomes on average in cb <dig>  purifying selection is reduced on the x chromosome.
