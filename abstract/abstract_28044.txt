BACKGROUND
mathematical modelling has become a standard technique to improve our understanding of complex biological systems. as models become larger and more complex, simulations and analyses require increasing amounts of computational power. clusters of computers in a high-throughput computing environment can help to provide the resources required for computationally expensive model analysis. however, exploiting such a system can be difficult for users without the necessary expertise.


RESULTS
we present condor-copasi, a server-based software tool that integrates copasi, a biological pathway simulation tool, with condor, a high-throughput computing environment. condor-copasi provides a web-based interface, which makes it extremely easy for a user to run a number of model simulation and analysis tasks in parallel. tasks are transparently split into smaller parts, and submitted for execution on a condor pool. result output is presented to the user in a number of formats, including tables and interactive graphical displays.


CONCLUSIONS
condor-copasi can effectively use a condor high-throughput computing environment to provide significant gains in performance for a number of model simulation and analysis tasks. condor-copasi is free, open source software, released under the artistic license  <dig> , and is suitable for use by any institution with access to a condor pool. source code is freely available for download at
