BACKGROUND
human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  vif hijacks an e <dig> ligase to suppress natural apobec <dig> restriction factors, and core binding factor β  is required for this process. although an extensive region of vif spanning most of its n-terminus is known to be critical for binding with cbf-β, involvement of the vif c-terminus in the interaction with cbf-β has not been fully investigated.


RESULTS
here, through immunoprecipitation analysis of vif c-terminal truncated mutants of various lengths, we identified that cbf-β binding requires not only certain amino acids  in the hcch region but also the hcch motif itself, which also affects the vif-mediated suppression of apobec3g/apobec3f . these mutants still maintained interactions with substrate a3g or a3f as well as other cellular factors elonginb/c , indicating that their structures were not functionally affected. moreover, by determining that the bc box also is necessary for cbf-β interaction in vivo, we speculate that binding to elob/c induces conformational changes in vif, facilitating its interaction with cbf-β and consequent interaction with cul <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide important information on the assembly of the vif-cul5-e <dig> ubiquitin ligase. identification of the new binding interface with cbf-β at the c-terminus of hiv- <dig> vif also provides novel targets for the development of hiv- <dig> inhibitors.
