BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common bacterial pathogen infecting the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis . the liverpool epidemic strain  is transmissible, capable of superseding other p. aeruginosa populations and is associated with increased morbidity. previously, multiple inducible prophages have been found to coexist in the les chromosome and to constitute a major component of the accessory genome not found in other sequenced p. aerugionosa strains. les phages confer a competitive advantage in a rat model of chronic lung infection and may, therefore underpin les prevalence. here the infective properties of three les phages were characterised.


RESULTS
this study focuses on three of the five active prophages  that are members of the siphoviridae. all were induced from lesb <dig> by norfloxacin. lytic production of lesφ <dig> was considerably higher than that of lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig>  each phage was capable of both lytic and lysogenic infection of the susceptible p. aeruginosa host, pao <dig>  producing phage-specific plaque morphologies. in the pao <dig> host background, the lesφ <dig> prophage conferred immunity against lesφ <dig> infection and reduced susceptibility to lesφ <dig> infection. each prophage was less stable in the pao <dig> chromosome with substantially higher rates of spontaneous phage production than when residing in the native lesb <dig> host. we show that les phages are capable of horizontal gene transfer by infecting p. aeruginosa strains from different sources and that type iv pili are required for infection by all three phages.


CONCLUSIONS
multiple inducible prophages with diverse infection properties have been maintained in the les genome. our data suggest that lesφ <dig> is more sensitive to induction into the lytic cycle or has a more efficient replicative cycle than the other les phages.
