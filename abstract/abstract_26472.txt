BACKGROUND
the rad <dig> cohesin plays, besides its well-recognised role in chromatid cohesion, a role in dna double strand break  repair. in arabidopsis there are three rad <dig> paralog genes , yet only atrad <dig>  has been shown to be required for dna dsb damage repair. further investigation of the role of cohesins in dna dsb repair was carried out and is here reported.


RESULTS
we show for the first time that not only atrad <dig>  but also atrad <dig>  play a role in somatic dna dsb repair. comet data shows that the lack of either cohesins induces a similar high basal level of dna dsb in the nuclei and a slower dna dsb repair kinetics in both cohesin mutants. the observed atrad <dig>  transcriptional response to dna dsb induction reinforces further the role of this cohesin in dna dsb repair. the importance of atrad <dig>  in dna dsb damage repair, after exposure to dna dsb damage inducing agents, is notorious and recognisably evident at the phenotypical level, particularly when the atrad <dig>  gene is also disrupted.

data on the kinetics of dna dsb damage repair and dna damage sensitivity assays, of single and double atrad <dig> mutants, as well as the transcription dynamics of the atrad <dig> cohesins over a period of 48 hours after the induction of dna dsb damage is also shown.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrates that both arabidopsis cohesin  play a role in somatic dna dsb repair. furthermore, the phenotypical data from the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant indicates that these two cohesins function synergistically in dna dsb repair. the implications of this data are discussed.
