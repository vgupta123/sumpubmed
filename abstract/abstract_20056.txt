BACKGROUND
mapping the intracellular fluxes for established mammalian cell lines becomes increasingly important for scientific and economic reasons. however, this is being hampered by the high complexity of metabolic networks, particularly concerning compartmentation.


RESULTS
intracellular fluxes of the cho-k <dig> cell line central carbon metabolism were successfully determined for a complex network using non-stationary 13c metabolic flux analysis. mass isotopomers of extracellular metabolites were determined using  glucose as labeled substrate. metabolic compartmentation and extracellular transport reversibility proved essential to successfully reproduce the dynamics of the labeling patterns. alanine and pyruvate reversibility changed dynamically even if their net production fluxes remained constant. cataplerotic fluxes of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and mitochondrial malic enzyme and pyruvate carboxylase were successfully determined. glycolytic pyruvate channeling to lactate was modeled by including a separate pyruvate pool. in the exponential growth phase, alanine, glycine and glutamate were excreted, and glutamine, aspartate, asparagine and serine were taken up; however, all these amino acids except asparagine were exchanged reversibly with the media. high fluxes were determined in the pentose phosphate pathway and the tca cycle. the latter was fueled mainly by glucose but also by amino acid catabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
the cho-k <dig> central metabolism in controlled batch culture proves to be robust. it has the main purpose to ensure fast growth on a mixture of substrates and also to mitigate oxidative stress. it achieves this by using compartmentation to control nadph and nadh availability and by simultaneous synthesis and catabolism of amino acids.
