BACKGROUND
copy number variations  have been shown important in both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility, and are increasingly accepted as another important source of genetic variation complementary to single nucleotide polymorphism . comprehensive identification and cataloging of pig cnvs would be of benefit to the functional analyses of genome variation.


RESULTS
in this study, we performed a genome-wide cnv detection based on the porcine snp <dig> genotyping data of  <dig> pigs from three pure breed populations  and one duroc × erhualian crossbred population. a total of  <dig> cnv regions  across genome were identified, which cover  <dig> mb of the pig genome and correspond to  <dig> % of the autosomal genome sequence. the length of these cnvrs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .7kb with an average of  <dig> kb, and the frequencies of them varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. these cnvrs contains  <dig> annotated genes, which possess a great variety of molecular functions, making them a promising resource for exploring the genetic basis of phenotypic variation within and among breeds. to confirmation of these findings,  <dig> cnvrs representing different predicted status and frequencies were chosen for validation via quantitative real time pcr . accordingly,  <dig>  of them was successfully confirmed.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated that currently available porcine snp <dig> beadchip can be used to capture cnvs efficiently. our study firstly provides a comprehensive map of copy number variation in the pig genome, which would be of help for understanding the pig genome and provide preliminary foundation for investigating the association between various phenotypes and cnvs.
