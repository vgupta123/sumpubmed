BACKGROUND
the complete arabidopsis transcript microarray  initiative combines the efforts of laboratories in eight european countries  <cit>  to deliver gene-specific sequence tags  for the arabidopsis research community. the catma initiative offers the power and flexibility to regularly update the gst collection according to evolving knowledge about the gene repertoire. these gst amplicons can easily be reamplified and shared, subsets can be picked at will to print dedicated arrays, and the gsts can be cloned and used for other functional studies. this ongoing initiative has already produced approximately  <dig>  gsts that have been made publicly available for spotted microarray printing and rna interference.


RESULTS
gsts from the catma version  <dig> repertoire  were mapped onto the gene models from two independent arabidopsis nuclear genome annotation efforts, tigr <dig> and psb-eugène, to consolidate a list of genes that were targeted by previously designed catma tags. a total of  <dig>  gene models were not tagged by any amplified catmav <dig> gst, and  <dig>  amplified gsts were no longer predicted to tag an updated gene model. to validate the efficacy of gst mapping criteria and design rules, the predicted and experimentally observed hybridization characteristics associated to gst features were correlated in transcript profiling datasets obtained with the catmav <dig> microarray, confirming the reliability of this platform. to complete the catma repertoire, all  <dig>  gene models for which no gst had yet been designed were processed with an adjusted version of the specific primer and amplicon design software . a total of  <dig>  novel gsts were designed and amplified by pcr from genomic dna. together with the pre-existing gst collection, this new addition constitutes the catmav <dig> repertoire. it comprises  <dig>  unique amplified sequences that tag  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein-encoding nuclear gene models in the tair <dig> and eugène genome annotations, respectively. to cover the remaining untagged genes, we identified  <dig> additional gsts using less stringent design criteria and designed  <dig> sequence tags matching multiple members of gene families  to cover any remaining untagged genes. these latter  <dig>  features constitute the catmav <dig> addition.


CONCLUSIONS
to update the catma gst repertoire, we designed  <dig>  additional sequence tags, bringing the total number of tagged tair6-annotated arabidopsis nuclear protein-coding genes to  <dig> . this resource is used both for the production of spotted microarrays and the large-scale cloning of hairpin rna silencing vectors. all information about the resulting updated catma repertoire is available through the catma database http://www.catma.org.
