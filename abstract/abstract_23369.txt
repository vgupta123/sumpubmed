BACKGROUND
spinocerebellar ataxia also referred to as hereditary ataxia comprises different forms of progressive neurodegenerative diseases. a complex mode of inheritance was most likely in parson russell terriers  and in jack russell terriers . recently, the missense mutation kcnj10:c.627c > g was shown to be associated with the spinocerebellar ataxia  in jrt and related russell group of terriers, whereas the missense mutation capn1:c.344g > a was associated with late onset ataxia  in prt.


RESULTS
we performed a genome-wide association study  in prt including  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls and found a statistically strong signal in the genomic region on dog chromosome  <dig>  where kcnj <dig> is located. we tested the capn1:c.344g > a and kcnj10:c.627c > g  mutations in a sample of  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt from germany as well as further  <dig> controls from  <dig> different dog breeds. all cases and controls genotyped carried the wild-type for the capn1:c.344g > a mutation. among the prt, 17/ <dig>  dogs were homozygous for the mutant kcnj <dig> allele and 22/ <dig>  dogs were heterozygous. three cases of prt had the homozygous kcnj <dig> wild-type. in jrt, 1/ <dig> cases did show the mutant kcnj <dig> allele homozygous. thus, we sequenced the kcnj <dig> exons with their adjacent regions from  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt including the animals with imperfect co-segregation of the c.627c > g mutation. we identified a total of  <dig> genetic variants within kcnj <dig>  the most likely variant explaining the cases appeared a 1-bp-insertion in a c-stretch within exon  <dig> . in silico analysis showed that this indel may influence the regulation of gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, 16/ <dig> cases of hereditary ataxia perfectly co-segregated with the kcnj10:c.627c > g mutation. the capn1:c.344g > a mutation could not be validated and seems to be a rare variant in the samples screened. screening kcnj <dig> for further mutations did result in a genetic variant explaining  <dig> jrt cases but further  <dig> cases with a non-mutant homozygous c.627c > g genotype could not be resolved. breeders have to be aware that dna-testing for hereditary ataxia in prt and jrt does not capture all cases of hereditary ataxia in these dog breeds. at least one further form of hereditary ataxia not yet resolved by a mutation may occur in prt and jrt.
