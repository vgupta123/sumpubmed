BACKGROUND
salinization causes negative effects on plant productivity and poses an increasingly serious threat to the sustainability of agriculture. wild soybean  can survive in highly saline conditions, therefore provides an ideal candidate plant system for salt tolerance gene mining.


RESULTS
as a first step towards the characterization of genes that contribute to combating salinity stress, we constructed a full-length cdna library of glycine soja  leaf treated with  <dig> mm nacl, using the smart technology. random expressed sequence tag  sequencing of  <dig>  clones produced  <dig>  cleaned ests for gene expression analysis. the average read length of cleaned ests was  <dig> bp, with an average gc content of 40%. these ests were assembled using the phrap program to generate  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets. the resulting unigenes were categorized according to the gene ontology  hierarchy. the potential roles of gene products associated with stress related ests were discussed. we compared the est sequences of glycine soja to that of glycine max by using the blastn algorithm. most expressed sequences from wild soybean exhibited similarity with soybean. all our est data are available on the internet .


CONCLUSIONS
the glycine soja ests will be used to mine salt tolerance gene, whose full-length cdnas will be obtained easily from the full-length cdna library. comparison of glycine soja ests with those of glycine max revealed the potential to investigate the wild soybean's expression profile using the soybean's gene chip. this will provide opportunities to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying stress response of plants.
