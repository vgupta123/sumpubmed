BACKGROUND
the inorganic  phosphate transporter  family comprises known and putative na+- or h+-dependent pi-transporting proteins with representatives from all kingdoms. the mammalian members are placed in the outer cell membranes and suggested to supply cells with pi to maintain house-keeping functions. alignment of protein sequences representing pit family members from all kingdoms reveals the presence of conserved amino acids and that bacterial phosphate permeases and putative phosphate permeases from archaea lack substantial parts of the protein sequence when compared to the mammalian pit family members. besides being na+-dependent pi  transporters, the mammalian pit paralogs, pit <dig> and pit <dig>  also are receptors for gamma-retroviruses. we have here exploited the dual-function of pit <dig> and pit <dig> to study the structure-function relationship of pit proteins.


RESULTS
we show that the human pit <dig> histidine, h <dig>  and the human pit <dig> glutamate, e <dig>  - both conserved in eukaryotic pit family members - are critical for pi transport function. noticeably, human pit <dig> h <dig> is located in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence, and human pit <dig> e <dig> is located in prodom domains characteristic for all pit family members.

a human pit <dig> truncation mutant, which consists of the predicted  <dig> transmembrane  domain backbone without a large intracellular domain , was found to be a fully functional pi transporter. further truncation of the human pit <dig> protein by additional removal of two predicted tm domains together with the large intracellular domain created a mutant that resembles a bacterial phosphate permease and an archaeal putative phosphate permease. this human pit <dig> truncation mutant  did also support pi transport albeit at very low levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that the overall structure of the pi-transporting unit of the pit family proteins has remained unchanged during evolution. moreover, in combination, our studies of the gene structure of the human pit <dig> and pit <dig> genes  and alignment of protein sequences of pit family members from all kingdoms, along with the studies of the dual functions of the human pit paralogs show that these proteins are excellent as models for studying the evolution of a protein's structure-function relationship.
