BACKGROUND
classical nuclear localization signal  dependent nuclear import is carried out by a heterodimer of importin α and importin β. nls cargo is recognized by importin α, which is bound by importin β. importin β mediates translocation of the complex through the central channel of the nuclear pore, and upon reaching the nucleus, rangtp binding to importin β triggers disassembly of the complex. to date, six importin α family members, encoded by separate genes, have been described in humans.


RESULTS
we sequenced and characterized a seventh member of the importin α family of transport factors, karyopherin α  <dig> , which is most closely related to kpna <dig>  the domain of kpna <dig> that binds importin β  is divergent, and shows stronger binding to importin β than the ibb domains from of other importin α family members. with regard to nls recognition, kpna <dig> binds to the retinoblastoma  nls to a similar degree as kpna <dig>  but it fails to bind the sv40-nls and the human nucleoplasmin  nls. kpna <dig> shows a predominantly nuclear distribution under steady state conditions, which contrasts with kpna <dig> which is primarily cytoplasmic.


CONCLUSIONS
kpna <dig> is a novel importin α family member in humans that belongs to the importin α <dig> subfamily. kpna <dig> shows different subcellular localization and nls binding characteristics compared to other members of the importin α family. these properties suggest that kpna <dig> could be specialized for interactions with select nls-containing proteins, potentially impacting developmental regulation.
