BACKGROUND
vascular branching morphogenesis is responsible for the extension of blood vessels into growing tissues, a process crucial for organogenesis. however, the genetic mechanism for vessel branching is largely unknown. zebrafish reg <dig> is a temperature-sensitive mutation exhibiting defects in blood vessel branching which results in the formation of swollen vessel lumina during capillary plexus formation.


RESULTS
we performed a screening for chemical suppressors of reg <dig> and identified skf <dig>  an inhibitor of histamine methyltransferase , that can rescue the reg <dig> vessel branching defects in a dose-dependent manner. inhibition of hmt by skf <dig> presumably blocks histamine degradation, thus causing histamine accumulation. consistent with this idea, we found that a high level of histamine also showed significant suppression of reg <dig> vessel phenotypes. interestingly, when reg <dig> adults that had already developed swollen vessel lumina in regenerating fins were treated with histamine or skf <dig>  either treatment significantly reduced the number of swollen vessels within  <dig> h, suggesting a rapid and constant influence of histamine on blood vessel branching. furthermore, the expression of hmt was significantly elevated in reg <dig> regenerating fins. conversely, lowering histamine by administering urocanic acid, a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, enhanced the reg <dig> phenotypes. finally, we identified that the transcription factor, egr- <dig> , was closely associated with the reg <dig> phenotype and chemical treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results suggest that blood vessel branching is influenced by histamine metabolism, possibly through regulating the expression of the egr- <dig> transcription factor.
