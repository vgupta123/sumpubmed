BACKGROUND
in high density arrays, the identification of relevant genes for disease classification is complicated by not only the curse of dimensionality but also the highly correlated nature of the array data. in this paper, we are interested in the question of how many and which genes should be selected for a disease class prediction. our work consists of a bayesian supervised statistical learning approach to refine gene signatures with a regularization which penalizes for the correlation between the variables selected.


RESULTS
our simulation results show that we can most often recover the correct subset of genes that predict the class as compared to other methods, even when accuracy and subset size remain the same. on real microarray datasets, we show that our approach can refine gene signatures to obtain either the same or better predictive performance than other existing methods with a smaller number of genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our novel bayesian approach includes a prior which penalizes highly correlated features in model selection and is able to extract key genes in the highly correlated context of microarray data. the methodology in the paper is described in the context of microarray data, but can be applied to any array data  as a first step towards predictive modeling of cancer pathways. a user-friendly software implementation of the method is available.
