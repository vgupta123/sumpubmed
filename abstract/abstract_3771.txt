BACKGROUND
dapfinder and dapview are novel brb-arraytools plug-ins to construct gene coexpression networks and identify significant differences in pairwise gene-gene coexpression between two phenotypes.


RESULTS
each significant difference in gene-gene association represents a differentially associated pair . our tools include several choices of filtering methods, gene-gene association metrics, statistical testing methods and multiple comparison adjustments. network results are easily displayed in cytoscape. analyses of glioma experiments and microarray simulations demonstrate the utility of these tools.


CONCLUSIONS
dapfinder is a new friendly-user tool for reconstruction and comparison of biological networks.
