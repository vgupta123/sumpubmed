BACKGROUND
this study examined the effects of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids  as different n-6: n- <dig> ratios on spatial learning and gene expression of peroxisome- proliferator-activated receptors  in the hippocampus of rats. thirty male sprague–dawley rats were randomly allotted into  <dig> groups of ten animals each and received experimental diets with different n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratios of either 65: <dig>  22: <dig> or  <dig> : <dig>  after 10 weeks, the spatial memory of the animals was assessed using the morris water maze test. the expression of pparα and pparγ genes were determined using real-time pcr.


RESULTS
decreasing dietary n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratios improved the cognitive performance of animals in the morris water maze test along with the upregulation of pparα and pparγ gene expression. the animals with the lowest dietary n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratio presented the highest spatial learning improvement and ppar gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
it can be concluded that modulation of n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratios in the diet may lead to increased hippocampal ppar gene expression and consequently improved spatial learning and memory in rats.
