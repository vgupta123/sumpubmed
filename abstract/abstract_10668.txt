BACKGROUND
the ankyrin repeat and suppressor of cytokine signalling  box proteins  are a large protein family implicated in diverse biological processes including regulation of proliferation and differentiation. the socs box of asb proteins is important in a ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis pathway. here, we aimed to evaluate expression and function of human asb- <dig> .


RESULTS
we found that a variant of asb <dig> that lacks the socs box  was naturally detected in human cell lines but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or normal hepatocytes. we also identified ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase  as a new target of asb <dig> in human embryonic kidney  <dig>  cells. the ankyrin repeat domains of asb <dig> can associate with the substrate binding site of umtck in a socs box-independent manner. the overexpression of asb <dig>  but not asb9Δsocs, induces ubiquitination of umtck. asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs can interact and colocalise with umtck in the mitochondria. however, only expression of asb <dig> induced abnormal mitochondrial structure and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. furthermore, the creatine kinase activities and cell growth were significantly reduced by asb <dig> but not by asb9Δsocs.


CONCLUSIONS
asb <dig> interacts with the creatine kinase system and negatively regulates cell growth. the differential expression and function of asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs may be a key factor in the growth of human cell lines and primary cells.
