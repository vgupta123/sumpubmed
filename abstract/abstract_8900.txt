BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa causes lung infections in patients suffering from the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis . once a chronic lung infection is established, p. aeruginosa cannot be eradicated by antibiotic treatment. phage therapy is an alternative to treat these chronic p. aeruginosa infections. however, little is known about the factors which influence phage infection of p. aeruginosa under infection conditions and suitable broad host range phages.


RESULTS
we isolated and characterized a phage, named jg <dig>  which infects a broad range of clinical and environmental p. aeruginosa strains. sequencing of the phage genome revealed that the phage jg <dig> is highly related to the ubiquitous and conserved pb1-like phages. the receptor of phage jg <dig> was determined as lipopolysaccharide. we used an artificial sputum medium to study phage infection under conditions similar to a chronic lung infection. alginate production was identified as a factor reducing phage infectivity.


CONCLUSIONS
phage jg <dig> is a suitable broad host range phage which could be used in phage therapy. phage infection experiments under simulated chronic lung infection conditions showed that alginate production reduces phage infection efficiency.
