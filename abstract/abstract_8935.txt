BACKGROUND
mirna profiling performed in myogenic cells and biopsies from skeletal muscles has previously identified mirnas involved in myogenesis.


RESULTS
here, we have performed mirna transcriptome profiling in human affinity-purified cd56+ myoblasts induced to differentiate in vitro. in total, we have identified  <dig> mirnas differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation. many were not known for being differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation. of these,  <dig>  were upregulated and  <dig>  were downregulated. mrna transcriptome profiling performed in parallel resulted in identification of  <dig>  genes differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
this simultaneous mirna/mrna transcriptome profiling allowed us to predict with high accuracy target genes of myogenesis-related micrornas and to deduce their functions.
