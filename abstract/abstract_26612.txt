BACKGROUND
the genus flavivirus encompasses more than  <dig> distinct species of arthropod-borne viruses, including several major human pathogens, such as west nile virus, yellow fever virus, japanese encephalitis virus and the four serotypes of dengue viruses . each year, flaviviruses cause more than  <dig> million infections worldwide, some of which lead to life-threatening conditions such as encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever. among the viral proteins, ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins constitute the major enzymatic components of the viral replication complex and are essential to the flavivirus life cycle.


RESULTS
we report here the results of a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the interactions between human host proteins and the flavivirus ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins. using our screen results and literature curation, we performed a global analysis of the ns <dig> and ns <dig> cellular targets based on functional annotation with the gene ontology features. we finally created the first flavivirus ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins interaction network and analysed the topological features of this network. our proteome mapping screen identified  <dig> human proteins interacting with ns <dig> or ns <dig> proteins or both. the global analysis of the cellular targets revealed the enrichment of host proteins involved in rna binding, transcription regulation, vesicular transport or innate immune response regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
we proposed that the selective disruption of these newly identified host/virus interactions could represent a novel and attractive therapeutic strategy in treating flavivirus infections. our virus-host interaction map provides a basis to unravel fundamental processes about flavivirus subversion of the host replication machinery and/or immune defence strategy.
