BACKGROUND
the importance of the wild boar as a reservoir of lawsonia intracellularis was assessed by investigating the seroprevalence of this pathogen among wild boars in the republic of korea. the extent of exposure to l. intracellularis among wild boars  was monitored by a country-wide serological survey using an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay.


RESULTS
in this study, antibodies to l. intracellularis were observed in  <dig> of  <dig> clinically healthy wild boars tested. the overall apparent prevalence calculated directly from the sample and the true prevalence calculated based on the accuracy of the test method were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. serologically positive animals were found in all the tested provinces.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm that l. intracellularis is present in the wild boar population worldwide, even in far east asia. despite the high seroprevalence shown in wild boars, further studies are warranted to evaluate their potential as a reservoir species because seroprevalence does not prove ongoing infection nor shedding of the bacteria in amounts sufficient to infect other animals. it should also be determined whether the wild boar, like the domestic pig, is a natural host of l. intracellularis.
