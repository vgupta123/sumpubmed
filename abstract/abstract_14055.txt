BACKGROUND
starch accumulation and degradation in chloroplasts is accomplished by a suite of over  <dig> enzymes. recent work has emphasized the importance of multi-protein complexes amongst the metabolic enzymes, and the action of associated non-enzymatic regulatory proteins. arabidopsis at5g <dig> encodes a protein of unknown function whose sequence was previously demonstrated to contain a putative carbohydrate-binding domain.


RESULTS
we here show that at5g <dig> is chloroplast-localized, and binds starch, with a preference for amylose. the protein persists in starch binding under conditions of ph, redox and mg+ <dig> concentrations characteristic of both the day and night chloroplast cycles. bioinformatic analysis demonstrates a diurnal pattern of gene expression, with an accumulation of transcript during the light cycle and decline during the dark cycle. a corresponding diurnal pattern of change in protein levels in leaves is also observed. sequence analysis shows that at5g <dig> has a strongly-predicted coiled-coil domain. similar analysis of the set of starch metabolic enzymes shows that several have strong to moderate coiled-coil potential. gene expression analysis shows strongly correlated patterns of co-expression between at5g <dig> and several starch metabolic enzymes.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that at5g <dig> is a regulatory scaffold protein, persistently binding the starch granule, where it is positioned to interact by its coiled-coil domain with several potential starch metabolic enzyme binding-partners.
