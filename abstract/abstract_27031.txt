BACKGROUND
in situ hybridization  is a powerful method for visualizing gene expression patterns at the organismal level with cellular resolution. when automated, it is capable of determining the expression of a large number of genes.


RESULTS
the expression patterns of  <dig> genes that encode enzymes were determined by ish in the mid-gestation mouse embryo, a stage that models the complexity of the adult organism. forty-five percent of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes  showed a regional expression pattern. a similar percentage was found for the  <dig> kinases that were also analyzed. many mrnas encoding glycolytic and tca cycle enzymes exhibited a characteristic expression pattern. the annotated expression patterns were deposited on the genepaint database and are retrievable by user-defined queries including gene name and sites of expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> expression patterns discussed here comprised gene products with activities associated with catalysis. preliminary analysis of these data revealed that a significant number of genes encoding housekeeping functions such as biosynthesis and catabolism were expressed regionally, so they could be used as tissue-specific gene markers. we found no difference in tissue specificity between mrnas encoding housekeeping functions and those encoding components of signal transduction pathways, as exemplified by the kinases.
