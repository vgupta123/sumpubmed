BACKGROUND
a key event in plant morphogenesis is the establishment of a division plane. a plant-specific microtubular preprophase band  accurately predicts the line of cell division, whereas the phragmoplast, another plant-specific array, executes cell division by maintaining this predicted line. although establishment of these specific arrays apparently involves intracellular repolarization events that focus cellular resources to a division site, it still remains unclear how microtubules position the cell division planes. here we study gfp-ateb <dig> decorated microtubule plus-ends to dissect events at the division plane.


RESULTS
early mitotic events included guided growth of endoplasmic microtubules  towards the ppb site and their coincident localization with endocytic vesicles. consequently, an endosomal belt lay in close proximity to the microtubular ppb at its maturation and was maintained during spindle formation. during cytokinesis, emts radiated from the former spindle poles in a geometrical conformation correlating with cell-plate navigation and tilt-correction. naphthylphtalamic acid , an inhibitor of polar auxin efflux, caused abnormal ppbs and shifted division planes.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations reveal a spatio-temporal link between microtubules and intracellular polarization essential for localized endocytosis and precise establishment of the division plane in plants. additionally, they implicate the growth regulator, auxin, in this important cellular event.
