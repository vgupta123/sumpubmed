BACKGROUND
mutation of amino acid sequences in a protein may have diverse effects on its structure and function. point mutations of even a single amino acid residue in the helices of the non-redundant database may lead to sequentially identical peptides which adopt different secondary structures in different proteins. however, various physico-chemical factors which govern the formation of these ambivalent helices generated by point mutations of a sequence are not clearly known.


RESULTS
sequences generated by point mutations of helices are mapped on to their non-helical counterparts in the scop database. the results show that short helices are prone to transform into non-helical conformations upon point mutations. mutation of amino acid residues by helix breakers preferentially yield non-helical conformations, while mutation with residues of intermediate helix propensity display least preferences for non-helical conformations. differences in the solvent accessibility of the mutating/mutated residues are found to be a major criteria for these sequences to conform to non-helical conformations. even with minimal differences in the amino acid distributions of the sequences flanking the helical and non-helical conformations, helix-flanking sequences are found be more solvent accessible.


CONCLUSIONS
all types of mutations from helical to non-helical conformations are investigated. the primary factors attributing such changes in conformation can be: i) type/propensity of the mutating and mutant residues ii) solvent accessibility of the residue at the mutation site iii) context/environment dependence of the flanking sequences. the results from the present study may be used to design de novo proteins via point mutations.
