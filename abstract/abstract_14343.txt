BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens sbw <dig> has been extensively studied because of its plant growth promoting properties and potential as a biocontrol agent. the genome of sbw <dig> has been sequenced, and among sequenced strains of pseudomonads, sbw <dig> appears to be most closely related to p. fluorescens wh <dig>  in the authorsâ€™ laboratories, wh <dig> was previously shown to produce and secrete 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine , a non-proteinogenic amino acid with selective herbicidal and antimicrobial activity. although sbw <dig> does not have the genetic capacity to produce fvg, we were interested in determining whether this pseudomonad might produce some other type of non-proteinogenic amino acid.


RESULTS
p. fluorescens sbw <dig> was found to produce and secrete a ninhydrin-reactive compound with selective antimicrobial properties. this compound was purified from sbw <dig> culture filtrate and identified as the non-proteinogenic amino acid l-furanomycin .


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of furanomycin as a secondary metabolite of sbw <dig> is the first report of the production of furanomycin by a pseudomonad. this compound was known previously only as a natural product produced by a strain of streptomyces. this report adds furanomycin to the small list of non-proteinogenic amino acids that have been identified as secondary products of pseudomonads. this study also extends the list of bacteria that are inhibited by furanomycin to include several plant pathogenic bacteria.
