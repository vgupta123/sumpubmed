BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is considered to be an important emerging pathogen associated with a number of different syndromes and diseases in pigs known as pcv2-associated diseases. it has been responsible for significant mortality among pigs and remains a serious economic problem to the swine industry worldwide leading to significant negative impacts on profitability of pork production.


RESULTS
in this study we have demonstrated that pcv <dig> capsid  protein based virus-like particles  were efficiently produced in yeast s. cerevisiae and induced production of monoclonal antibodies  reactive with virus-infected cells. moreover, pcv <dig> cap vlps served as a highly specific recombinant antigen for the development of an indirect igg pcv <dig> cap vlp-based elisa for the detection of virus-specific igg antibodies in swine sera. four hundred-nine serum samples collected from pigs in lithuania were tested for pcv2-specific igg to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed elisa in parallel using a commercial serelisa test as a gold standard. from  <dig> tested serum samples,  <dig> samples were positive by both assays. thirty-nine sera from  <dig> serum samples were determined as negative by serelisa but were found to be positive both in the newly developed indirect igg pcv <dig> cap vlp-based elisa and the pcr test.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that s. cerevisiae expression system is an alternative to insect/baculovirus expression system for production of homogenous in size and shape pcv <dig> cap protein-based vlps similar to native virions. yeast expression system tolerated native virus genes encoding pcv <dig> cap protein variants as well as the codon-optimized gene. moreover, yeast-derived pcv <dig> cap vlps were capable to induce the generation of pcv2-specific mabs that did not show any cross-reactivity with pcv1-infected cells. the high sensitivity and specificity of the indirect igg pcv <dig> cap vlp-based elisa clearly suggested that this assay is potentially useful diagnostic tool for screening pcv2–suspected samples.
