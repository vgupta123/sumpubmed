BACKGROUND
adam <dig> is a metalloprotease-disintegrin implicated in ectodomain shedding and cell adhesion. aberrant adam <dig> expression has been associated with human cancer and other disorders. we have previously shown that the alternative splicing of adam <dig> transcripts is mis-regulated in cancer cells. to gain a better understanding of adam <dig> regulation, its genomic organization and regulatory elements as well as the alternative exon use in human tissues were characterized.


RESULTS
human adam <dig>  flanked by the flj32785/dcst <dig> and ephrin-a <dig> genes, spans  <dig>  kb from the translation initiation codon to the polyadenylation signal, being the shortest multiple-exon adam gene. the gene contains  <dig> exons varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and  <dig> introns from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the gene appeared to have several transcription start sites and their location suggested the promoter location within a cpg island proximal to the translation start. reporter expression experiments confirmed the location of functional gc-rich, tataless and caatless promoter, with the most critical transcription-supporting elements located - <dig> to - <dig> bp relative to the translation start. normal human tissues showed different complex patterns of at least  <dig> different adam <dig> splice variants arising from the alternative use of the cytosolic-encoding exons  <dig>  20a/b, and 21a/b. the deduced adam <dig> protein isoforms have different combinations of cytosolic regulatory protein interaction motifs.


CONCLUSIONS
characterization of human adam <dig> gene and identification of elements involved in the regulation of transcription and alternative splicing provide important clues for elucidation of physiological and pathological roles of adam <dig>  the present results also show that the alternative exon use is a physiological post-transcriptional mechanism regulating adam <dig> expression in human tissues.
