BACKGROUND
transthyretin  amyloidosis is a hereditary disease with a complex genotype-phenotype correlation. we conducted a literature survey to define the clinical landscape of ttr amyloidosis across populations worldwide. then, we investigated whether the genetically determined ttr expression differs among human populations, contributing to the differences observed in patients. polygenic scores for genetically determined ttr expression in  <dig> clinically relevant tissues were constructed using data from the gtex  project and tested in the samples from the  <dig>  genomes project.


RESULTS
we observed differences among the ancestral groups and, to a lesser extent, among the investigated populations within the ancestry groups. scandinavian populations differed in their genetically determined ttr expression of skeletal muscle tissue with respect to southern europeans . this is in line with epidemiological data related to swedish and portuguese ttr val30met endemic areas. familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy  presents clinical variability among human populations, a finding that agrees with the among-ancestry diversity of genetically determined ttr expression in heart tissues .


CONCLUSIONS
genetically determined ttr expression varied across human populations. this might contribute to the genotype-phenotype correlation of ttr amyloidosis.
