BACKGROUND
commensal-derived probiotic bacteria inhibit enteric pathogens and regulate host immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract, but studies examining specific functions of beneficial microbes in the context of biofilms have been limited in scope.


RESULTS
lactobacillus reuteri formed biofilms that retained functions potentially advantageous to the host including modulation of cytokine output and the production of the antimicrobial agent, reuterin. immunomodulatory activities of biofilms were demonstrated by the abilities of specific l. reuteri strains to suppress human tnf production by lps-activated monocytoid cells. quantification of the antimicrobial glycerol derivative, reuterin, was assessed in order to document the antipathogenic potential of probiotic biofilms. l. reuteri biofilms differed in the quantities of reuterin secreted in this physiological state.


CONCLUSIONS
l. reuteri biofilms secreted factors that confer specific health benefits such as immunomodulation and pathogen inhibition. future probiotic selection strategies should consider a strain's ability to perform beneficial functions as a biofilm.
