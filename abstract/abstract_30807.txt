BACKGROUND
the restoration of adults from fragments of blood vessels in botryllid ascidians  represents an inimitable event in the chordates, which is poorly understood on the mechanistic level.


RESULTS
to elucidate mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, a subtracted est library for early wbr stages was previously assembled, revealing  <dig> putative genes belonging to major signaling pathways, including notch/delta, jak/stat, protein kinases, nuclear receptors, ras oncogene family members, g-protein coupled receptor  and transforming growth factor beta  signaling. rt-pcr on selected transcripts documented specific up-regulation in only regenerating fragments, pointing to a broad activation of these signaling pathways at onset of wbr. the followed-up expression pattern of seven representative transcripts from jak/stat signaling , the ras oncogene family , the protein kinase family , bl-cnot, bl-slit and bl-bax inhibitor, revealed systemic and site specific activations during wbr in a sub-population of circulatory cells.


CONCLUSIONS
wbr in the non-vertebrate chordate botrylloides leachi is a multifaceted phenomenon, presided by a complex array of cell signaling and transcription factors. above results, provide a first insight into the whole genome molecular machinery of this unique regeneration process, and reveal the broad participation of cell signaling and transcription factors in the process. while regeneration involves the participation of specific cell populations, wbr signals are systemically expressed at the organism level.
