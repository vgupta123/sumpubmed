BACKGROUND
the protist plasmodiophora brassicae is a soil-borne pathogen of cruciferous species and the causal agent of clubroot disease of brassicas including agriculturally important crops such as canola/rapeseed . p. brassicae has remained an enigmatic plant pathogen and is a rare example of an obligate biotroph that resides entirely inside the host plant cell. the pathogen is the cause of severe yield losses and can render infested fields unsuitable for brassica crop growth due to the persistence of resting spores in the soil for up to 20 years.


RESULTS
to provide insight into the biology of the pathogen and its interaction with its primary host b. napus, we produced a draft genome of p. brassicae pathotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  that differ in their host range. pb <dig> is highly virulent on b. napus  while pb <dig> infects only vegetable brassica crops. both the pb <dig> and pb <dig> genomes are highly compact, each with a total size of  <dig>  mb, and contain less than 2 % repetitive dna. clustering of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms  of pb <dig>  pb <dig> and three additional re-sequenced pathotypes  shows a high degree of correlation of cluster grouping with host range. the pb <dig> genome features significant reduction of intergenic space with multiple examples of overlapping untranslated regions . dependency on the host for essential nutrients is evident from the loss of genes for the biosynthesis of thiamine and some amino acids and the presence of a wide range of transport proteins, including some unique to p. brassicae. the annotated genes of pb <dig> include those with a potential role in the regulation of the plant growth hormones cytokinin and auxin. the expression profile of pb <dig> genes, including putative effectors, during infection and their potential role in manipulation of host defence is discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
the p. brassicae genome sequence reveals a compact genome, a dependency of the pathogen on its host for some essential nutrients and a potential role in the regulation of host plant cytokinin and auxin. genome annotation supported by rna sequencing reveals significant reduction in intergenic space which, in addition to low repeat content, has likely contributed to the p. brassicae compact genome.
