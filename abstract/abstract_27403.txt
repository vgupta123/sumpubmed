BACKGROUND
sequences homologous to the gypsy retroelement from drosophila melanogaster are widely distributed among drosophilids. the structure of gypsy includes an open reading frame resembling the retroviral gene env, which is responsible for the infectious properties of retroviruses.


RESULTS
in this study we report molecular and phylogeny analysis of the complete env gene from ten species of the obscura group of the genus drosophila and one species from the genus scaptomyza.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that in most cases env sequences could produce a functional env protein and therefore maintain the infectious capability of gypsy in these species.
