BACKGROUND
the vesicular b0at <dig> transporter , one of the members of the slc <dig> family, is a transporter for neutral amino acids and is exclusively expressed in brain. here we provide a comprehensive expression profile of b0at <dig> in mouse brain using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
we confirmed previous expression data from rat brain and used a novel custom made antibody to obtain detailed co-labelling with several cell type specific markers. b0at <dig> was highly expressed in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. the b0at <dig> expression was highly overlapping with those of vesicular glutamate transporter  <dig>  and vesicular glutamate transporter  <dig> . we also show here that slc6a17mrna is up-regulated in animals subjected to short term food deprivation as well as animals treated with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and the dopamine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor bupropion.


CONCLUSIONS
this suggests that the b0at <dig> transporter have a role in regulation of monoaminergic as well as glutamatergic synapses.
