BACKGROUND
the present study investigated the antibacterial activity and underlying mechanisms of ginkgolic acid  c15: <dig> monomer using green fluorescent protein -labeled bacteria strains.


RESULTS
ga presented significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria but generally did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria. the studies of the antibacterial mechanism indicated that large amounts of ga  could penetrate gfp-labeled bacillus amyloliquefaciens in a short period of time, and as a result, led to the quenching of gfp in bacteria. in vitro results demonstrated that ga  could inhibit the activity of multiple proteins including dna polymerase. in vivo results showed that ga  could significantly inhibit the biosynthesis of dna, rna and b. amyloliquefaciens proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
we speculated that ga  achieved its antibacterial effect through inhibiting the protein activity of b. amyloliquefaciens. ga  could not penetrate gram-negative bacteria in large amounts, and the lipid soluble components in the bacterial cell wall could intercept ga , which was one of the primary reasons that ga  did not have a significant antibacterial effect on gram-negative bacteria.
