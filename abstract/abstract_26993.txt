BACKGROUND
aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is an oral bacterium associated with aggressively progressing periodontitis. extracellular release of bacterial outer membrane proteins has been suggested to mainly occur via outer membrane vesicles. this study investigated the presence and conservation of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein  among a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, the immunostimulatory effect of aapal, and whether live cells release this structural outer membrane lipoprotein in free-soluble form independent of vesicles.


RESULTS
the pal locus and its gene product were confirmed in clinical a. actinomycetemcomitans strains by pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism and immunoblotting. culturing under different growth conditions revealed no apparent requirement for the aapal expression. inactivation of pal in a wild-type strain  and in its spontaneous laboratory variant  resulted in pleiotropic cellular effects. in a cell culture insert model , aapal was detected from filtrates when strains d7s and d7ss were incubated in serum or broth in the inserts. electron microscopy showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans vesicles  were larger than the filter pores and that there were no vesicles in the filtrates. the filtrates were immunoblot negative for a cytoplasmic marker, cyclic amp  receptor protein. an ex vivo model indicated cytokine production from human whole blood stimulated by aapal.


CONCLUSIONS
free-soluble aapal can be extracellularly released in a process independent of vesicles.
