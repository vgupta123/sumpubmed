BACKGROUND
acute pressure on the sciatic nerve has recently been reported to provide rapid short-term relief of pain in patients with various pathologies. wide dynamic range  neurons transmit nociceptive information from the dorsal horn to higher brain centers. in the present study, we examined the effect of a 2-min application of sciatic nerve pressure on wdr neuronal activity in anesthetized male sprague–dawley rats.


RESULTS
experiments were carried out on  <dig> male sprague–dawley albino rats weighing 160– <dig> grams. dorsal horn wdr neurons were identified on the basis of characteristic responses to mechanical stimuli applied to the cutaneous receptive field. acute pressure was applied for  <dig> min to the sciatic nerve using a small vascular clip. the responses of wdr neurons to three mechanical stimuli applied to the cutaneous receptive field were recorded before, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min after cessation of the 2-min pressure application on the sciatic nerve. two-min pressure applied to the sciatic nerve caused rapid attenuation of the wdr response to pinching, pressure and brushing stimuli applied to the cutaneous receptive field. maximal attenuation of the wdr response to pinching and pressure was noted  <dig> min after release of the 2-min pressure on the sciatic nerve. the mean firing rate decreased from  <dig> ± <dig>  hz to 13± <dig>  hz upon pinching , from  <dig> ± <dig>  hz to  <dig> ± <dig>  hz  when pressure was applied, and from  <dig> ± <dig>  hz to  <dig> ± <dig>  hz  upon brushing. thereafter, the mean firing rates gradually recovered.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that acute pressure applied to the sciatic nerve exerts a rapid inhibitory effect on the wdr response to both noxious and innocuous stimuli. our results may partially explain the rapid analgesic effect of acute sciatic nerve pressure noted in clinical studies, and also suggest a new model for the study of pain.
