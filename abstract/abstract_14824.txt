BACKGROUND
cotton is the dominant textile crop and also serves as an important oil crop. an estimated 15% economic loss associated with cotton production in china has been caused by diseases, and no resistance genes have been cloned in this crop. molecular markers developed from resistance gene homologues  might be tightly linked with target genes and could be used for marker-assisted selection  or gene cloning.


RESULTS
to genetically map expressed rghs,  <dig> potential pathogenesis-related proteins  and  <dig> resistance gene analogs  were identified in the cotton expressed sequence tag database, and  <dig> specific primers were developed. meanwhile,  <dig> cotton genome-derived rga markers and  <dig> resistance gene analog polymorphism  markers from published papers were included to view their genomic distribution. as a result,  <dig> est-derived and  <dig> genome-derived rgh markers were added to our interspecific genetic map. these  <dig> markers were distributed on  <dig> of the  <dig> cotton chromosomes, with  <dig> markers on  <dig> chromosomes . homologous rghs tended to be clustered; rgh clusters appeared on  <dig> chromosomes, with larger clusters on chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig>  which suggests that rgh clusters are widely distributed in the cotton genome. expression analysis showed that  <dig> rghs were significantly altered after inoculation with the v <dig> stain of verticillium dahliae. comparative mapping showed that four rgh markers were linked with mapped loci for verticillium wilt resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
the genetic mapping of rghs confirmed their clustering in cotton genome. expression analysis and comparative mapping suggest that est-derived rghs participate in cotton resistance. rgh markers are seemed to be useful tools to detected resistance loci and identify candidate resistance genes in cotton.
