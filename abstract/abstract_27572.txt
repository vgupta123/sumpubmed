BACKGROUND
rhesus monkeys  are widely-used as experimental animals in biomedical research and are closely related to other laboratory macaques, such as cynomolgus monkeys , and to humans, sharing a last common ancestor from about  <dig> million years ago. although rhesus monkeys have been studied extensively under field and laboratory conditions, research has been limited by the lack of genetic resources. the present study generated placenta full-length cdna libraries, characterized the resulting expressed sequence tags, and described their utility for comparative mapping with human refseq mrna transcripts.


RESULTS
from rhesus monkey placenta full-length cdna libraries,  <dig> full-length cdna sequences were determined and  <dig> rhesus placenta cdna sequences longer than  <dig> bp were collected. these sequences were annotated based on homology to human genes. homology search against human refseq mrnas revealed that our collection included the sequences of  <dig> putative rhesus monkey genes. moreover, we identified  <dig> genes containing exon alterations in the coding region and the untranslated region of rhesus monkey transcripts, despite the highly conserved structure of the coding regions. approximately 10%  of all full-length cdna sequences did not represent any public human refseq mrnas. intriguingly, two rhesus monkey specific exons derived from the transposable elements of aluyra <dig>  and mer11b  were also identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> rhesus monkey placenta full-length cdna sequences described here could expand genomic resources and information of rhesus monkeys. this increased genomic information will greatly contribute to the development of evolutionary biology and biomedical research.
