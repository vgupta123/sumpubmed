BACKGROUND
mycobacteria other than m. bovis may interfere with current bovine tuberculosis diagnostic tests resulting in false positive test results. as the prevalence of m. bovis decreases in the united states, interference from other mycobacteria play an increasingly important role in preventing the eradication of m. bovis. to identify mycobacteria other than m. bovis that may be interfering with current diagnostic tests, a retrospective study was performed to identify mycobacteria isolated from clinical tissues at the national veterinary services laboratories between  <dig> january  <dig> and  <dig> october  <dig> 


RESULTS
during the study period,  <dig>  mycobacteria other than m. bovis were isolated from samples submitted for clinical diagnosis of m. bovis. fifty-five mycobacterial species were isolated during this time period. in cattle, m. avium complex, m. fortuitum/fortuitum complex, m. smegmatis, m. kansasii, and m. terrae complex were the predominate species other than m. bovis isolated from tissues submitted for culture. mycobacteria other than m. bovis isolated from deer were predominantly m. avium complex, m. terrae/terrae complex, and m. fortuitum/fortuitum complex.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide information characterizing the species and relative prevalence of mycobacteria other than m. bovis that may interfere with current diagnostic tests.
