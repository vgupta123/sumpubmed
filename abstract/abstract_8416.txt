BACKGROUND
the  <dig> -dihydroxy phenyl l-alanine  is a drug of choice for parkinson's disease, controlling changes in energy metabolism enzymes of the myocardium following neurogenic injury. aspergillus oryzae is commonly used for l-dopa production; however, potential improvements in ease of handling, growth rate and environmental impact have led to an interest in exploiting alternative yeasts. the two important elements required for l-dopa production are intracellular tyrosinases  and l-ascorbate, which acts as a reducing agent.


RESULTS
pre-grown cells of yarrowia lipolytica nrrl- <dig> were used for the microbiological transformation of l-tyrosine to l-dopa. different diatomite concentrations  were added to the acidic  reaction mixture. maximum l-dopa biosynthesis  was obtained when  <dig>  mg/ml diatomite was added  <dig> min after the start of the reaction. after optimizing reaction time , and yeast cell concentration , an overall  <dig>  fold higher l-dopa production rate was observed when compared to the control. significant enhancements in yp/s, qs and qs over the control were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
diatomite  addition  <dig> min after reaction commencement improved microbiological transformation of l-tyrosine to l-dopa  by y. lipolytica nrrl- <dig>  a 35% higher substrate conversion rate was achieved when compared to the control.
