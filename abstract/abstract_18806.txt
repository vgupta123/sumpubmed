BACKGROUND
cassava mosaic disease is caused by several distinct geminivirus species, including south african cassava mosaic virus- . to date, there is limited gene regulation information on viral stress responses in cassava, and global transcriptome profiling in sacmv-infected cassava represents an important step towards understanding natural host responses to plant geminiviruses.


RESULTS
a rna-seq time course  study, monitoring gene expression in sacmv-challenged susceptible  and tolerant  cassava landraces, was performed using the applied biosystems  solid next-generation sequencing platform. the multiplexed paired end sequencing run produced a total of 523 mb and 693 mb of paired-end reads for sacmv-infected susceptible and tolerant cdna libraries, respectively. of these, approximately  <dig> % of the t <dig> reads and  <dig> % of tme <dig> reads mapped to the cassava reference genome available in phytozome. using a log <dig> fold cut-off , comparative analysis between the six normalized cdna libraries showed that  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts in total were differentially expressed in t <dig> and tme <dig>  respectively, across  <dig>   <dig> and 67 days post infection, compared to mock-inoculated. the number of responsive transcripts increased dramatically from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi in both cultivars, but in contrast, in t <dig> the levels did not change significantly at  <dig> dpi, while in tme <dig> they declined. goslim functional groups illustrated that differentially expressed genes in t <dig> and tme <dig> were overrepresented in the cellular component category for stress-related genes, plasma membrane and nucleus. alterations in the expression of other interesting genes such as transcription factors, resistance  genes, and histone/dna methylation-associated genes, were observed. kegg pathway analysis uncovered important altered metabolic pathways, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, sucrose and starch metabolism, and plant hormone signalling.


CONCLUSIONS
molecular mechanisms for tme <dig> tolerance are proposed, and differences in patterns and levels of transcriptome profiling between t <dig> and tme <dig> with susceptible and tolerant phenotypes, respectively, support the hypothesis that viruses rearrange their molecular interactions in adapting to hosts with different genetic backgrounds.
