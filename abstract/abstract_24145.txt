BACKGROUND
twelve populations of e. coli were serially propagated for  <dig>  generations in a glucose-supplemented minimal medium in order to study the dynamics of evolution. we sought to find and characterize one of the beneficial mutations responsible for the adaptation and other phenotypic changes, including increased cell size, in one of these populations.


RESULTS
we used transposon-tagging followed by p1-transduction into the ancestor, screening for increased cell size and fitness, co-transduction analysis, and dna sequencing. we identified a 1-bp insertion in the boxg <dig> region located upstream of glmus, an operon involved in cell-wall biosynthesis. when transduced into the ancestor, this mutation increased competitive fitness by about 5%. this mutation spread through its population of origin between  <dig> and  <dig> generations. mutations in this region were not found in the other  <dig> evolving populations, even after  <dig>  generations.


CONCLUSIONS
the 1-bp insertion in the boxg <dig> region near glmus was demonstrably beneficial in the environment in which it arose. the absence of similar mutations in the other evolved populations suggests that they substituted other mutations that rendered this particular mutation unimportant. these results show the unpredictability of adaptive evolution, whereas parallel substitutions at other loci in these same populations reveal the predictability.
