BACKGROUND
znf <dig> is a sequence-specific dna-binding protein that stimulates transcription of both small rna genes by rna polymerase ii or iii, or protein-coding genes by rna polymerase ii, using separable activating domains. we describe phenotypic effects following knockdown of this protein in developing danio rerio  embryos by injection of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides that target znf <dig> mrna.


RESULTS
the loss of function phenotype is pleiotropic and includes a broad array of abnormalities including defects in heart, blood, ear and midbrain hindbrain boundary. defects are rescued by coinjection of synthetic mrna encoding full-length znf <dig> protein, but not by protein lacking the amino-terminal activation domains. accordingly, expression of several marker genes is affected following knockdown, including gata-binding protein  <dig> , cardiac myosin light chain  <dig>  and paired box gene 2a . the zebrafish pax2a gene proximal promoter contains two binding sites for znf <dig>  and reporter gene transcription driven by this promoter in transfected cells is activated by this protein.


CONCLUSIONS
normal development of zebrafish embryos requires znf <dig>  furthermore, the pax2a gene is probably one example of many protein-coding gene targets of znf <dig> during zebrafish development.
