BACKGROUND
almost all foals develop transient diarrhoea within the first weeks of life. studies indicated different viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes, such as rotavirus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and cryptosporidium are discussed. but little is known about the development of intestinal microflora in foals. the present study investigated whether the supplementation with bacillus cereus var. toyoi would modify the developing intestinal microflora and consequently reduce diarrhoea in foals. from birth, the foals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo , low dosage  and high dosage . treatment groups were supplemented orally once a day for 58 days. faeces scoring and sampling were performed within the first 24 h after birth and on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> of the foal’s life and also on the first day of diarrhoea. culture-plate methods were used to analyse the bacterial microflora.


RESULTS
eighty-eight per cent of the foals developed diarrhoea  during the first 58 days of life. bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation had no effect on bacterial microflora. clostridium perfringens and enterobacteria were equally prevalent in foals with diarrhoea and those who were not afflicted.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the supplementation of b. cereus var. toyoi had no effect on the occurrence of diarrhoea and health status in the foals.
