BACKGROUND
drought stress tolerance for crop improvement is an important goal worldwide. drought is a complex trait, and it is vital to understand the complex physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance to ﻿tackle﻿ it effectively. osmotic adjustment, oxidative stress management , and cell membrane stability  are major components of cellular tolerance under drought stress. in the current study, we explored the molecular basis of osm in the drought tolerant rice variety, nagina  <dig> and compared it with the popular drought sensitive rice variety, ir  <dig>  under drought imposed at the reproductive stage, to understand how the parental polymorphisms correlate with the superiority of nagina  <dig> and tolerant bulk populations under drought.


RESULTS
we generated recombinant inbred lines  from contrasting parents nagina  <dig> and ir  <dig> and focussed on spikelet fertility , in terms of its correlation with osm, which is an important component of drought tolerance in nagina  <dig>  based on sf under drought stress and its correlations with other yield related traits, we used superoxide dismutase , glutathione reductase , and ascorbate peroxidase  activity assays to establish the relationship between sf and osm genes in the tolerant and sensitive lines. among the osm enzymes studied, gr had a significant and positive correlation with single plant yield  under drought stress. gr was also positively correlated with apx but negatively so with sod. interestingly, none of the enzyme-morphology correlations were significant under irrigated control . through genome-wide snp analysis of the  <dig> genes encoding for osm enzymes, we identified the functional polymorphisms between the parents and identified superior alleles. by using network analysis of osm genes in rice, we identified the genes that are central to the osm network.


CONCLUSIONS
from the biochemical and morphological data and the snp analysis, the superiority of nagina  <dig> in spikelet fertility under drought stress is because of its superior alleles for sod  and gr  rather than for apx, for which ir  <dig> had the superior allele . nagina  <dig> can bypass apx <dig> by directly interacting with soda. for nine of the  <dig> genes present in the central network, nagina  <dig> had the superior alleles. we propose that nagina  <dig> tolerance could mainly be because of soda which is a reactive oxygen scavenger in mitochondria which is directly associated with spikelet fertility.
