BACKGROUND
biological chemistry is very stereospecific. nonetheless, the diastereotopic oxygen atoms of diphosphate-containing molecules in the protein data bank  are often given names that do not uniquely distinguish them from each other due to the lack of standardization. this issue has largely not been addressed by the protein structure community.


RESULTS
of  <dig> diastereotopic atom pairs studied from the pdb,  <dig> were found to have names that are not uniquely assigned. among the molecules identified with these inconsistencies were many cofactors of enzymatic processes such as mononucleotides , dinucleotide cofactors , and coenzyme a. there were no overall trends in naming conventions, though ligand-specific trends were prominent.


CONCLUSIONS
the lack of standardized naming conventions for diastereotopic atoms of small molecules has left the ad hoc names assigned to many of these atoms non-unique, which may create problems in data-mining of the pdb. we suggest a naming convention to resolve this issue. the in-house software used in this study is available upon request.
