BACKGROUND
control of brucellosis in livestock, wildlife and humans depends on the reliability of the methods used for detection and identification of bacteria. in the present study, we describe the evaluation of the recently established real-time pcr assay based on the brucella-specific insertion sequence is <dig> with blood samples from  <dig> wild boars  and tissue samples from  <dig> wild boars  collected in switzerland. results from is <dig> real-time pcr were compared to those obtained by bacterial isolation, rose bengal test , competitive elisa  and indirect elisa .


RESULTS
in the first group of animals, is <dig> real-time pcr detected infection in  <dig> %  of wild boars that were serologically negative. serological tests showed different sensitivities  and only 2% of blood samples were positive with all three tests, which makes interpretation of the serological results very difficult. regarding the second group of animals, the is <dig> real-time pcr detected infection in 26% of animals, while brucella spp. could be isolated from tissues of only  <dig> % of the animals.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here indicate that is <dig> real-time pcr assay is a specific and sensitive tool for detection of brucella spp. infections in wild boars. for this reason, we propose the employment of is <dig> real-time pcr as a complementary tool in brucellosis screening programs and for confirmation of diagnosis in doubtful cases.
