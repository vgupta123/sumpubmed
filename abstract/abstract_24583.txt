BACKGROUND
salmonid fishes are among the most widely studied model fish species but reports on systematic evaluation of reference genes in qrt-pcr studies is lacking.


RESULTS
the stability of six potential reference genes was examined in eight tissues of atlantic salmon , to determine the most suitable genes to be used in quantitative real-time rt-pcr analyses. the relative transcription levels of genes encoding 18s rrna, s <dig> ribosomal protein, β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3p-dehydrogenase , and two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1a  were quantified in gills, liver, head kidney, spleen, thymus, brain, muscle, and posterior intestine in six untreated adult fish, in addition to a group of individuals that went through smoltification. based on calculations performed with the genorm vba applet, which determines the most stable genes from a set of tested genes in a given cdna sample, the ranking of the examined genes in adult atlantic salmon was ef1ab>ef1aa>β-actin>18s rrna>s20>gapdh. when the same calculations were done on a total of  <dig> individuals from four stages in the smoltification process , the gene ranking was ef1ab>ef1aa>s20>β-actin>18s rrna>gapdh.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, this work suggests that the ef1aa and ef1ab genes can be useful as reference genes in qrt-pcr examination of gene expression in the atlantic salmon.
