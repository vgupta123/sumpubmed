BACKGROUND
expansins form a large multi-gene family found in wheat and other cereal genomes that are involved in the expansion of cell walls as a tissue grows. the expansin family can be divided up into two main groups, namely, alpha-expansin  and beta-expansin proteins , with the expb group being of particular interest as group 1-pollen allergens.


RESULTS
in this study, three beta-expansin genes were identified and characterized from a newly sequenced region of the triticum aestivum cv. chinese spring chromosome 3b physical map at the sr <dig> locus . the analysis of a  <dig> kb sub-sequence of fpc contig ctg <dig> identified one beta-expansin genes to be taexpb <dig>  originally identified as a cdna from the wheat cv wyuna. through the analysis of intron sequences of the three wheat cv. chinese spring genes, we propose that two of these beta-expansin genes are duplications of the taexpb <dig> gene. comparative sequence analysis with two other wheat cultivars  and a triticum aestivum var. spelta line validated the identification of the chinese spring variant of taexpb <dig>  the expression in maternal and grain tissues was confirmed by examining est databases and carrying out rt-pcr experiments. detailed examination of the position of taexpb <dig> relative to the locus encoding sr <dig> disease resistance ruled out the possibility of this gene directly contributing to the resistance phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
through 3-d structural protein comparisons with zea mays expb <dig>  we proposed that variations within the coding sequence of taexpb <dig> in wheats may produce a functional change within features such as domain  <dig> related to possible involvement in cell wall structure and domain  <dig> defining the pollen allergen domain and binding to ige protein. the variation established in this gene suggests it is a clearly identifiable member of a gene family and reflects the dynamic features of the wheat genome as it adapted to a range of different environments and uses.
