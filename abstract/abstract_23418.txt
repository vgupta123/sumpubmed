BACKGROUND
nothofagus nervosa is one of the most emblematic native tree species of patagonian temperate forests. here, the shotgun rna-sequencing  of the transcriptome of n. nervosa, including de novo assembly, functional annotation, and in silico discovery of potential molecular markers to support population and associations genetic studies, are described.


RESULTS
pyrosequencing of a young leaf cdna library generated a total of  <dig>  high quality reads, with an average length of  <dig> bp. de novo assembly using newbler resulted into  <dig>  tentative isotigs . the non-assembled sequences  were clustered with cd-hit- <dig> to identify natural and artificial duplicates from pyrosequencing reads, leading to  <dig>  unique singletons.  <dig>  out of  <dig>  non-redundant sequences or unigenes, were successfully annotated against a plant protein database. a substantial number of simple sequence repeat markers  were discovered in the assembled and annotated sequences. more than 40% of the ssr sequences were inside orf sequences. to confirm the validity of these predicted markers, a subset of  <dig> ssrs selected through functional annotation evidences were successfully amplified from six seedlings dna samples, being  <dig> polymorphic.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper is the first report that shows a highly precise representation of the mrnas diversity present in young leaves of a native south american tree, n. nervosa, as well as its in silico deduced putative functionality. the reported nothofagus transcriptome sequences represent a unique resource for genetic studies and provide a tool to discover genes of interest and genetic markers that will greatly aid questions involving evolution, ecology, and conservation using genetic and genomic approaches in the genus.
