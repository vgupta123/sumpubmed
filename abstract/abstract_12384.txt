BACKGROUND
sleep disruptions are common in epilepsy patients. our previous study demonstrates that homeostatic factors and circadian rhythm may mediate epilepsy-induced sleep disturbances when epilepsy occurs at different zeitgeber hours. the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin- <dig> , is a somnogenic cytokine and may also be involved in epileptogenesis; however, few studies emphasize the effect of il- <dig> in epilepsy-induced sleep disruption. we herein hypothesized that il- <dig> receptor type  <dig>  mediates the pathogenesis of epilepsy and epilepsy-induced sleep disturbances. we determined the role of il-1r <dig> by using il-1r <dig> knockout  mice.


RESULTS
our results elucidated the decrease of non-rapid eye movement  sleep during the light period in il-1r −/− mice and confirmed the somnogenic role of il-1r <dig>  rapid electrical amygdala kindling was performed to induce epilepsy at the particular zeitgeber time  point, zt <dig>  our results demonstrated that seizure thresholds induced by kindling stimuli, such as the after-discharge threshold and successful kindling rates, were not altered in il-1r −/− mice when compared to those obtained from the wildtype mice . this result suggests that il-1r <dig> is not involved in kindling-induced epileptogenesis. during sleep, zt <dig> kindling stimulation significantly enhanced nrem sleep during the subsequent 6 h  in wildtype mice, and sleep returned to the baseline the following day. however, the kindling-induced sleep alteration was absent in the il-1r −/− ko mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the il- <dig> signal mediates epilepsy-induced sleep disturbance, but dose not participate in kindling-induced epileptogenesis.
