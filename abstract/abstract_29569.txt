BACKGROUND
the involvement of astrocyte water channel aquaporin- <dig>  in autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system has been suggested following the identification of aqp <dig> autoantibodies in neuromyelitis optica, an inflammatory demyelinating disease.


RESULTS
we investigated the involvement of aqp <dig> in disease severity in an established mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  produced by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein  peptide. eae was remarkably attenuated in aqp <dig> null mice compared to identically treated wildtype mice. whereas most wildtype mice developed progressive tail and hindlimb paralysis, clinical signs were virtually absent in aqp <dig> null mice. brain and spinal cords from aqp <dig> null mice showed greatly reduced mononuclear cell infiltration compared to wildtype mice, with relatively little myelin loss and axonal degeneration.


CONCLUSIONS
the reduced severity of autoimmune encephalomyelitis in aqp <dig> deficiency suggests aqp <dig> as a novel determinant in autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system and hence a potential drug target.
