BACKGROUND
downy mildew , caused by pathogen plasmopara viticola  is the single most damaging disease of grapes  worldwide. however, the mechanisms of the disease development in grapes are poorly understood. a method for estimating gene expression levels using solexa sequencing of type i restriction-endonuclease-generated cdna fragments was used for deep sequencing the transcriptomes resulting from pv infected leaves of vitis amurensis rupr. cv. zuoshan- <dig>  our goal is to identify genes that are involved in resistance to grape dm disease.


RESULTS
approximately  <dig>  million  21-nt cdna tags were sequenced in the cdna library derived from pv pathogen-infected leaves, and about  <dig>  m were sequenced from the cdna library constructed from the control leaves. when annotated, a total of  <dig>  putative genes were identified from the solexa sequencing tags for the infection  library and  <dig>  for the control  library. comparative analysis between these two cdna libraries showed about  <dig> % of the unique tags increased by at least five-fold, and about  <dig> % of the unique tags decreased more than five-fold in infected leaves, while  <dig> % of the unique tags showed less than five-fold difference between the two samples. the expression levels of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr and the trends observed agreed well with the solexa expression profiles, although the degree of change was lower in amplitude. after pathway enrichment analysis, a set of significantly enriched pathways were identified for the differentially expressed genes , which associated with ribosome structure, photosynthesis, amino acid and sugar metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presented a series of candidate genes and pathways that may contribute to dm resistance in grapes, and illustrated that the solexa-based tag-sequencing approach was a powerful tool for gene expression comparison between control and treated samples.
