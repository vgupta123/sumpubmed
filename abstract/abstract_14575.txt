BACKGROUND
to date, mitochondrial genomes of more than one hundred flatworms  have been sequenced. they show a high degree of similarity and a strong taxonomic bias towards parasitic lineages. the mitochondrial gene atp <dig> has not been confidently annotated in any flatworm sequenced to date. however, sampling of free-living flatworm lineages is incomplete. we addressed this by sequencing the mitochondrial genomes of the two small-bodied  free-living flatworms stenostomum sthenum and macrostomum lignano as the first representatives of the earliest branching flatworm taxa catenulida and macrostomorpha respectively.


RESULTS
we have used high-throughput dna and rna sequence data and pcr to establish the mitochondrial genome sequences and gene orders of s. sthenum and m. lignano. the mitochondrial genome of s. sthenum is  <dig>  bp long and includes a  <dig>  bp long inverted repeat region containing the complete sequences of nad <dig>  rrns, and nine trna genes. the model flatworm m. lignano has the smallest known mitochondrial genome among free-living flatworms, with a length of  <dig>  bp. the mitochondrial genome of m. lignano lacks duplicated genes, however, tandem repeats were detected in a non-coding region.

mitochondrial gene order is poorly conserved in flatworms, only a single pair of adjacent ribosomal or protein-coding genes – nad4l-nad <dig> – was found in s. sthenum and m. lignano that also occurs in other published flatworm mitochondrial genomes. unexpectedly, we unambiguously identified the full metazoan mitochondrial protein-coding gene complement including atp <dig> in s. sthenum and m. lignano. a subsequent search detected atp <dig> in all mitochondrial genomes of polyclad flatworms published to date, although the gene wasn’t previously annotated in these species.


CONCLUSIONS
manual, but not automated genome annotation revealed the presence of atp <dig> in basally branching free-living flatworms, signifying both the importance of manual data curation and of diverse taxon sampling. we conclude that the loss of atp <dig> within flatworms is restricted to the parasitic taxon neodermata.
