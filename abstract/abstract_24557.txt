BACKGROUND
phytoene synthase  <dig>  is the most important regulatory enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, whereas its function is hardly known in common wheat. the aims of the present study were to investigate psy <dig> function and genetic regulation using reverse genetics approaches.


RESULTS
transcript levels of psy <dig> in rnai transgenic lines were decreased by 54–76 % and yellow pigment content  was reduced by 26–35 % compared with controls, confirming the impact of psy <dig> on carotenoid accumulation. a series of candidate genes involved in secondary metabolic pathways and core metabolic processes responded to psy <dig> down-regulation. the aspartate rich domain  was important for psy <dig> function, and conserved nucleotides adjacent to the domain influenced ypc by regulating gene expression, enzyme activity or alternative splicing. compensatory responses analysis indicated that three psy <dig> homoeologs may be coordinately regulated under normal conditions, but separately regulated under stress. the period 14 days post anthesis  was found to be a key regulation node during grain development.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings define key aspects of flour color regulation in wheat and facilitate the genetic improvement of wheat quality targeting color/nutritional specifications required for specific end products.
