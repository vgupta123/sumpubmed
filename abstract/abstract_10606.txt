BACKGROUND
protein kinase c  is known to be involved in the pathophysiology of experimental cerebral ischemia. we have previously shown that after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, there is an upregulation of endothelin receptors in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. the present study aimed to examine the effect of the pkc inhibitor ro-32- <dig> on endothelin receptor upregulation, infarct volume and neurology outcome after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat.


RESULTS
at  <dig> hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion , the contractile endothelin b receptor mediated response and the endothelin b receptor protein expression were upregulated in the ipsilateral but not the contralateral middle cerebral artery. in ro-32- <dig> treated rats, the upregulated endothelin receptor response was attenuated. furthermore, ro-32- <dig> treatment decreased the ischemic brain damage significantly and improved neurological scores. immunohistochemistry showed fainter staining of endothelin b receptor protein in the smooth muscle cells of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of ro-32- <dig> treated rats compared to control.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that treatment with ro-32- <dig> in ischemic stroke decreases the ischemic infarction area, neurological symptoms and associated endothelin b receptor upregulation. this provides a new perspective on possible mechanisms of actions of pkc inhibition in cerebral ischemia.
