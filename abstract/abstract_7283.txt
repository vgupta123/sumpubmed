BACKGROUND
the origin, evolution and speciation of the lion, has been subject of interest, debate and study. the present surviving lions of the genus panthera comprise of eight sub-species inclusive of asiatic lion panthera leo persica of india's gir forest. except for the asiatic lion, the other seven subspecies are found in different parts of africa. there have been different opinions regarding the phylogenetic status of panthera leo, as well as classifying lions of different geographic regions into subspecies and races. in the present study, mitogenome sequence of p. leo persica deduced, using ion torrent pgm to assess phylogeny and evolution which may play an increasingly important role in conservation biology.


RESULTS
the mtdna sequence of p. leo persica is  <dig>  bp in length with  <dig> % gc content. annotation of mitogenome revealed total  <dig> genes, including  <dig> protein coding,  <dig> rrna and  <dig> trna. phylogenetic analysis based on whole mitogenome, suggests panthera pardus as a neighbouring species to p. leo with species divergence at ~ <dig>  mya.


CONCLUSIONS
this work presents first report on complete mitogenome of panthera leo persica. it sheds light on the phylogenetic and evolutionary status within and across felidae members. the result compared and evaluated with earlier reports of felidae shows alteration of phylogenetic status and species evolution. this study may provide information on genetic diversity and population stability.
