BACKGROUND
rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. we previously cloned the rice blast resistance gene pid <dig>  which encodes a transmembrane receptor-like kinase containing an extracellular b-lectin domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. however, little is known about pid2-mediated signaling.


RESULTS
here we report the functional characterization of the u-box/arm repeat protein ospub <dig> as one of the pid2-binding proteins. we found that ospub <dig> physically interacted with the kinase domain of pid <dig>  in vitro and in vivo and the arm repeat domain of ospub <dig> was essential for the interaction. in vitro biochemical assays indicated that pid2k possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate ospub <dig>  we also found that the phosphorylated form of ospub <dig> possessed e <dig> ligase activity. expression pattern analyses revealed that ospub <dig> was constitutively expressed and its encoded protein ospub <dig> was localized in cytosol. transgenic rice plants over-expressing ospub <dig> at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses, including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, up-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains. we also observed that, along with plant growth, the cell death lesions kept spreading over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in a seedling lethal phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
these results reveal that the e <dig> ligase ospub <dig> interacts directly with the receptor-like kinase pid <dig> and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance.
