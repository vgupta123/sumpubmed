BACKGROUND
the global ppgpp-mediated stringent response in pathogenic bacteria plays an important role in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections. in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium , several genes, including virulence genes, are regulated by ppgpp when bacteria are under the stringent response. to understand the control of virulence genes by ppgpp in s. typhimurium, agarose 2-dimensional electrophoresis  combined with mass spectrometry was used and a comprehensive 2-de reference map of amino acid-starved s. typhimurium strain sh <dig>  a derivative of atcc  <dig>  was established.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> examined spots,  <dig> proteins were successfully identified. the comparative analysis of the wild-type and ppgpp <dig> mutant strains revealed  <dig> proteins, the expression patterns of which were affected by ppgpp. using a mouse infection model, we further identified a novel virulence-associated factor, stm <dig>  from the ppgpp-regulated and salmonella-specific proteins. in addition, salmonella strains carrying mutations in the gene encoding stm <dig> showed growth defects and impaired growth within macrophage-like raw <dig>  cells. furthermore, we found that expression of stm <dig> was controlled by ppgpp and ssrb, a response regulator of the two-component system located on salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
a proteomic approach using a 2-de reference map can prove a powerful tool for analyzing virulence factors and the regulatory network involved in salmonella pathogenesis. our results also provide evidence of a global response mediated by ppgpp in s. enterica.
