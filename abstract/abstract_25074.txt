BACKGROUND
the interacting residues of protein and nucleic acid sequences are close to each other â€“ they are co-located. structure databases  contain all information about these co-locations; however it is not an easy task to penetrate this complex information. we developed a java tool, called seqx for this purpose.


RESULTS
seqx tool is useful to detect, analyze and visualize residue co-locations in protein and nucleic acid structures. the user

a. selects a structure from pdb;

b. chooses an atom that is commonly present in every residues of the nucleic acid and/or protein structure

c. defines a distance from these atoms . the seqx tool detects every residue that is located within the defined distances from the defined "backbone" atom; provides a dotplot-like visualization , and calculates the frequency of every possible residue pairs  in the observed structure. it is possible to exclude +/-  <dig> to  <dig> neighbor residues in the same polymeric chain from detection, which greatly improves the specificity of detections . results obtained on protein structures showed highly significant correlations with results obtained from literature . the co-location frequency of physico-chemically compatible amino acids is significantly higher than is calculated and expected in random protein sequences .


CONCLUSIONS
the tool is simple and easy to use and provides a quick and reliable visualization and analyses of residue co-locations in protein and nucleic acid structures.

availability and requirements
 seqx, java j2se runtime environment  <dig>   and at least a  <dig> ghz processor and with a minimum  <dig> mb ram. source codes are available from the authors.
