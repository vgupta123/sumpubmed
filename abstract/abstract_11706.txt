BACKGROUND
the cop9/signalosome  is a highly conserved eight subunit complex that, by deneddylating cullins in cullin-based e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, regulates protein degradation. although studied in model human cell lines such as hela, very little is known about the role of the csn in haemopoietic cells.


RESULTS
greater than 95% knockdown of the non-catalytic subunit csn <dig> and the deneddylating subunit csn <dig> of the csn was achieved in the human myeloid progenitor cell line k <dig>  csn <dig> knockdown led to a reduction of both csn <dig> protein and mrna whilst csn <dig> knockdown had little effect on csn <dig>  both knockdowns inhibited csn deneddylase function as demonstrated by accumulation of neddylated cul <dig>  furthermore, both knockdowns resulted in the sequential loss of skp <dig>  cdc <dig> and Î²-trcp f-box proteins. these proteins were rescued by the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig>  indicating the autocatalytic degradation of f-box proteins upon loss of csn <dig> or csn <dig>  interestingly, altered f-box protein gene expression was also observed in csn <dig> and csn <dig> knockdowns, suggesting a potential role of the csn in regulating f-box protein transcription.

loss of either csn subunit dramatically reduced cell growth but resulted in distinct patterns of cell death. csn <dig> knockdown caused mitotic defects, g2/m arrest and apoptotic cell death. csn <dig> knockdown resulted in non-apoptotic cell death associated with accumulation of both the autophagy marker lc3-ii and autophagic vacuoles. treatment of vector control k <dig> cells with the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin a <dig> recapitulated the growth kinetics, vacuolar morphology and lc3-ii accumulation of csn <dig> knockdown cells indicating that the cellular phenotype of csn <dig> cells arises from autophagy inhibition. finally, loss of csn <dig> was associated with the formation of a csn <dig> containing subcomplex.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that csn <dig> is required for csn integrity and the stability of individual csn subunits, and postulate that csn <dig> loss results in a phenotype distinct from that of cells lacking csn <dig> possibly as a consequence of altered csn <dig> activity within a resultant csn subcomplex. our data present the first evidence for the sequential loss of f-box proteins upon csn manipulation and are the first to identify a potential link between csn function and autophagy.
