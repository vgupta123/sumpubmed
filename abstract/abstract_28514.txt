BACKGROUND
the role of aspergillus fumigatus mycotoxins in the colonization of the respiratory tract by conidia has not been studied extensively, even though patients at risk from invasive aspergillosis frequently exhibit respiratory epithelium damage. in a previous study, we found that filtrates of a. fumigatus cultures can specifically alter the electrophysiological properties of human nasal epithelial cells  compared to those of non pathogenic moulds.


RESULTS
we fractionated the organic phase of filtrate from 3-day old a. fumigatus cultures using high-performance liquid chromatography. the different fractions were tested for their ability to modify the electrophysiological properties of hnec in an in vitro primary culture model.

the fraction collected between  <dig> and  <dig> min mimicked the effects of the whole filtrate, i.e. decrease of transepithelial resistance and increase of potential differences, and contained secondary metabolites such as helvolic acid, fumagillin, and verruculogen. only verruculogen  had effects similar to the whole filtrate. we verified that verruculogen was produced by a collection of  <dig> human, animal, plant and environmental a. fumigatus isolates. using ms-ms analysis, we found that verruculogen was associated with both mycelium and conidia extracts.


CONCLUSIONS
verruculogen is a secondary metabolite that modifies the electrophysiological properties of hnec. the role of these modifications in the colonization and invasion of the respiratory epithelium by a. fumigatus on first contact with the epithelium remains to be determined.
