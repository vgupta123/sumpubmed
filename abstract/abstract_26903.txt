BACKGROUND
soybean  is an important nitrogen-fixing crop that provides much of the world's protein and oil. however, the available tools for investigation of soybean gene function are limited. nevertheless, chemical mutagenesis can be applied to soybean followed by screening for mutations in a target of interest using a strategy known as targeting induced local lesions in genomes . we have applied tilling to four mutagenized soybean populations, three of which were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate  and one with n-nitroso-n-methylurea .


RESULTS
we screened seven targets in each population and discovered a total of  <dig> induced mutations. the nmu-treated population and one ems mutagenized population had similar mutation density , while another ems population had a mutation density of ~1/ <dig> kb. the remaining population had a mutation density of ~1/ <dig> kb. because of soybean's polyploid history, pcr amplification of multiple targets could impede mutation discovery. indeed, one set of primers tested in this study amplified more than a single target and produced low quality data. to address this problem, we removed an extraneous target by pretreating genomic dna with a restriction enzyme. digestion of the template eliminated amplification of the extraneous target and allowed the identification of four additional mutant alleles compared to untreated template.


CONCLUSIONS
the development of four independent populations with considerable mutation density, together with an additional method for screening closely related targets, indicates that soybean is a suitable organism for high-throughput mutation discovery even with its extensively duplicated genome.
