BACKGROUND
complete enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan to xylose requires the action of endoxylanase and β-xylosidase. β-xylosidases play an important part in hydrolyzing xylo-oligosaccharides to xylose. thermostable β-xylosidases have been a focus of attention as industrially important enzymes due to their long shelf life and role in the relief of end-product inhibition of xylanases caused by xylo-oligosaccharides. therefore, a highly thermostable β-xylosidase with high specific activity has significant potential in lignocellulose bioconversion.


RESULTS
a gene encoding a highly thermostable gh <dig> β-xylosidase was cloned from geobacillus sp. strain wsucf <dig> and expressed in escherichia coli. recombinant β-xylosidase was active over a wide range of temperatures and ph with optimum temperature of 70°c and ph  <dig> . it exhibited very high thermostability, retaining 50% activity at 70°c after 9 days. wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase is more thermostable than β-xylosidases reported from other thermophiles . specific activity was  <dig> u/mg when incubated with p-nitrophenyl xylopyranoside, with km and vmax values of  <dig>  mm and  <dig> u/mg, respectively. sds-page analysis indicated that the recombinant enzyme had a mass of 58 kda, but omitting heating prior to electrophoresis increased the apparent mass to 230 kda, suggesting the enzyme exists as a tetramer. enzyme exhibited high tolerance to xylose, retained approximately 70% of relative activity at 210 mm xylose concentration. thin layer chromatography showed that the enzyme had potential to convert xylo-oligomers  into fermentable xylose. wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase along with wsucf <dig> endo-xylanase synergistically converted the xylan into fermentable xylose with more than 90% conversion.


CONCLUSIONS
properties of the wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase i.e. high tolerance to elevated temperatures, high specific activity, conversion of xylo-oligomers to xylose, and resistance to inhibition from xylose, make this enzyme potentially suitable for various biotechnological applications.
