BACKGROUND
the diaphragm has sensory innervation from mechanoreceptors with myelinated axons entering the spinal cord via the phrenic nerve that project to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex. it was hypothesized that phrenic nerve afferent  projection to the central nervous system is via the spinal dorsal column pathway.


RESULTS
a single n <dig> peak of the cdp was found in the c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments. three peaks  were found in the c <dig> and c <dig> segments. no cdp was recorded at c <dig> dorsal spinal cord surface in cats.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate pna activation of neurons in the cervical spinal cord. three populations of myelinated pna  enter the cat's cervical spinal segments that supply the phrenic nerve
