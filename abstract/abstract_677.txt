BACKGROUND
micrornas are a class of small, non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression by binding target mrna, which leads to cleavage or translational inhibition. the nac proteins, which include nam, ataf, and cuc, are a plant-specific transcription factor family with diverse roles in development and stress regulation. it has been reported that mir <dig> negatively regulates nac <dig> expression, which in turn affects lateral root development in arabidopsis; however, little is known about the involvement of the maize nac family and mir <dig> in lateral root development.


RESULTS
we collected  <dig> maize transcripts with nac domains. of these,  <dig> zmnacs were putative targets for regulation by mir <dig>  we isolated one gene, called tc <dig>  from  <dig> maize inbred lines, 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  zmnac <dig> had a high expression level in roots and showed higher abundance  in zong <dig> relative to 87- <dig>  which had less lateral roots than zong <dig>  there was a significant correlation between the expression level of zmnac <dig> and the lateral root density in the recombinant inbred line  population. transgenic arabidopsis that overexpressed zmnac <dig> had increased lateral roots in comparison to the wild type. these findings suggest that zmnac <dig> played a significant role in lateral root development. an allelic expression assay showed that trans-regulatory elements were the dominant mediators of zmnac <dig> differential expression in 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  and further analysis revealed that mir <dig> was a trans-element that guided the cleavage of endogenous zmnac <dig> mrna. both mature mir <dig> and mir <dig> precursors had higher expression in 87- <dig> than zong <dig>  which was the opposite of the expression pattern of zmnac <dig>  additionally, the allelic assay showed that the cis-regulatory element most likely affected zm-mir164b's expression pattern. a Î²-glucuronidase  assay showed that the zm-mir164b promoter had higher gus activity in 87- <dig> than in zong <dig>  in addition, we detected mir164b expression in the ril population, and the results indicated that mir164b had a higher expression level in the rils containing 87- <dig> promoter than those containing zong <dig> promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate one possible pathway in maize by which differences in mir164b promoter activity resulted in a different expression pattern for mature mir <dig> which negatively regulates zmnac <dig> expression in 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  thereby contributing to a significantly different lateral root phenotype.
