BACKGROUND
rna polymerase iii  type  <dig> promoters such as u <dig> or 7sk are commonly used to express short-hairpin rna  effectors for rna interference . to extend the use of rnai for studies of development using the chicken as a model system, we have developed a system for expressing shrnas using the chicken 7sk  promoter.


RESULTS
we identified and characterised the ch7sk promoter sequence upstream of the full-length 7sk small nuclear rna  sequence in the chicken genome and used this to construct vectors to express shrnas targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein . we transfected chicken df- <dig> cells with these constructs and found that anti-egfp-shrnas  expressed from the ch7sk promoter could induce efficient knockdown of egfp expression. we further compared the efficiency of ch7sk-directed knockdown to that of chicken u <dig>  promoters and found that the efficiency of the ch7sk promoter was not greater than, but comparable to the efficiency of cu <dig> promoters.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have demonstrated that the ch7sk promoter can express shrnas capable of mediating efficient rnai in a chicken cell line. however, our finding that rnai driven by the ch7sk promoter is not more efficient than cu <dig> promoters contrasts previous comparisons of mammalian u <dig> and 7sk promoters. since the ch7sk promoter is the first non-mammalian vertebrate 7sk promoter to be characterised, this finding may be helpful in understanding the divergence of pol iii promoter activities between mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. this aside, our results clearly indicate that the ch7sk promoter is an efficient alternative to u6-based shrna expression systems for inducing efficient rnai activity in chicken cells.
