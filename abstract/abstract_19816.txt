BACKGROUND
growth factors and their receptors are mediators of organogenesis and must be tightly regulated in a temporal and spatial manner for proper tissue morphogenesis. intracellular regulators of growth factor signaling pathways provide an additional level of control. members of the sprouty family negatively regulate receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in several developmental contexts. to gain insight into the role of spry <dig> in neural crest development, we analyzed the developmental effects of conditional expression of spry <dig> in neural crest-derived tissues.


RESULTS
here we report that conditional expression of spry <dig> in neural crest cells causes defects in craniofacial and cardiac development in mice. spry1;wnt1-cre embryos die perinatally and exhibit facial clefting, cleft palate, cardiac and cranial nerve defects. these defects appear to be the result of decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of neural crest and neural crest-derived cell populations. in addition, the domains of expression of several key transcription factors important to normal craniofacial and cardiac development including ap <dig>  msx <dig>  dlx <dig>  and dlx <dig> were reduced in spry1;wnt1-cre transgenic embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these data suggest that spry <dig> is an important regulator of craniofacial and cardiac morphogenesis and perturbations in spry <dig> levels may contribute to congenital disorders involving tissues of neural crest origin.
