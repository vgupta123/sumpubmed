BACKGROUND
the ovine major histocompatibility complex  harbors genes involved in overall resistance/susceptibility of the host to infectious diseases. compared to human and mouse, the ovine mhc is interrupted by a large piece of autosome insertion via a hypothetical chromosome inversion that constitutes ~25% of ovine chromosome  <dig>  the evolutionary consequence of such an inversion and an insertion  in relation to mhc function remains unknown. we previously constructed a bac clone physical map for the ovine mhc exclusive of the insertion region. here we report the construction of a high-density physical map covering the autosome insertion in order to address the question of what the inversion/insertion had to do with ruminants during the mhc evolution.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> pairs of comparative bovine oligo primers were utilized to screen an ovine bac library for positive clones and the orders and overlapping relationships of the identified clones were determined by dna fingerprinting, bac-end sequencing, and sequence-specific pcr. a total of  <dig> positive bac clones were identified and  <dig> of the effective clones were ordered into an overlapping bac contig to cover the consensus region between ovine mhc class iia and iib. therefore, a continuous physical map covering the entire ovine autosome inversion/insertion region was successfully constructed. the map confirmed the bovine sequence assembly for the same homologous region. the dna sequences of  <dig> bac-ends have been deposited into ncbi database with the access numbers hr <dig> through hr <dig>  corresponding to dbgss id  <dig> through  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a high-density bac clone physical map for the ovine autosome inversion/insertion between the mhc class iia and iib. the entire ovine mhc region is now fully covered by a continuous bac clone contig. the physical map we generated will facilitate mhc functional studies in the ovine, as well as the comparative mhc evolution in ruminants.
