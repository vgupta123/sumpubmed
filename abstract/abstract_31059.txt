BACKGROUND
fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis snyd. & hans.  causes fusarium wilt, the most important infectious disease of melon . the four known races of this pathogen can be distinguished only by infection on appropriate cultivars. no molecular tools are available that can discriminate among the races, and the molecular basis of compatibility and disease progression are poorly understood. resistance to races  <dig> and  <dig> is controlled by a single dominant gene, whereas only partial polygenic resistance to race  <dig>  has been described. we carried out a large-scale cdna-aflp analysis to identify host genes potentially related to resistance and susceptibility as well as fungal genes associated with the infection process. at the same time, a systematic reisolation procedure on infected stems allowed us to monitor fungal colonization in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations.


RESULTS
melon plants , which are susceptible to race  <dig>  and resistant to race  <dig>  were artificially infected with a race  <dig> strain of fom or one of two race  <dig>  w strains. host colonization of stems was assessed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post inoculation , and the fungus was reisolated from infected plants. markedly different colonization patterns were observed in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations. five time points from the symptomless early stage  to obvious wilting symptoms  were considered for cdna-aflp analysis. after successful sequencing of  <dig> transcript-derived fragments  differentially expressed in infected plants, homology searching retrieved  <dig> melon transcripts,  <dig> fom transcripts expressed in planta and  <dig> orphan tdfs. rna samples from fom colonies of the three strains grown in vitro were also included in the analysis to facilitate the detection of in planta-specific transcripts and to identify tdfs differentially expressed among races/strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that resistance against fom in melon involves only limited transcriptional changes, and that wilting symptoms could derive, at least partially, from an active plant response.

we discuss the pathogen-derived transcripts expressed in planta during the infection process and potentially related to virulence functions, as well as transcripts that are differentially expressed between the two fom races grown in vitro. these transcripts provide candidate sequences that can be further tested for their ability to distinguish between races.
