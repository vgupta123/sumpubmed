BACKGROUND
to test the efficacy of the recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator  alteplase in horses, the thrombolytic effect was tested in in vitro generated equine thrombi. the extent of lysis was determined by measuring the decrease in thrombi weight over a period of 4 hours. in vivo pharmacokinetics of alteplase were determined in  <dig> healthy horses. a single dose  was applied via intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes coagulation-related variables, blood count and clinical parameters were taken before the treatment and until 48 h after treatment. in addition, plasma rt-pa concentration was measured until 300 min after commencing the infusion.


RESULTS
in vitro, a dose dependent decrease of thrombus weight ranging from a  <dig>  % decrease for  <dig>  μg/ml to  <dig>  % decrease for 5 μg/ml rt-pa was noted. the d-dimer concentration in the lysis medium correspondingly increased from  <dig>  up to  <dig>  mg/l.

in vivo, none of the horses showed an adverse reaction to the alteplase infusion. in some horses blood parameters were slightly altered. the 1 mg/kg dose yielded the following pharmacokinetic parameters: cmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml; cl =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ml/min/kg; dominant half life  =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  minutes; median elimination half life  = 171 min ; auc =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg · min /ml.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that a single dose of 1 mg/kg alteplase results in rt-pa plasma concentrations comparable to those in humans and might be sufficient for a thrombolytic therapy in horses. further studies must be performed to determine the alteplase effectiveness in horses with jugular vein thrombosis.
