BACKGROUND
cytokine-activated transcription factors from the stat  family control common and context-specific genetic programs. it is not clear to what extent cell-specific features determine the binding capacity of seven stat members and to what degree they share genetic targets. molecular insight into the biology of stats was gained from a meta-analysis of  <dig> available chip-seq data sets covering genome-wide occupancy of stats  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  5a, 5b and  <dig> in several cell types.


RESULTS
we determined that the genomic binding capacity of stats is primarily defined by the cell type and to a lesser extent by individual family members. for example, the overlap of shared binding sites between stats  <dig> and  <dig> in t cells is greater than that between stat <dig> in t cells and non-t cells. even for the top  <dig>  highly enriched stat binding sites, ~15% of stat <dig> binding sites in mouse female liver are shared by other stats in different cell types while in t cells ~90% of stat <dig> binding sites are co-occupied by stat <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig>  in addition, we identified  <dig> cis-regulatory modules , which are recognized by all stat members across cell types defining a common jak-stat signature. lastly, in liver stat <dig> binding significantly coincides with binding of the cell-specific transcription factors hnf4a, foxa <dig> and foxa <dig> and is associated with cell-type specific gene transcription.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that genomic binding of stats is primarily determined by the cell type and further specificity is achieved in part by juxtaposed binding of cell-specific transcription factors.
