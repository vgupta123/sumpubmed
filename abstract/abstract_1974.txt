BACKGROUND
we compared the relative precision and accuracy of expression measurements obtained from three different state-of-the-art commercial short and long-oligonucleotide microarray platforms . the design of the comparison was chosen to judge each platform in the context of a multi-project program.


RESULTS
all wet-lab experiments and raw data acquisitions were performed independently by each commercial platform. intra-platform reproducibility was assessed using measurements from all available targets. inter-platform comparisons of relative signal intensities were based on a common and non-redundant set of roughly  <dig>  targets chosen for their unique correspondence toward a single transcript. despite many examples of strong similarities we found several areas of discrepancy between the different platforms.


CONCLUSIONS
we found a higher level of reproducibility from one-color based microarrays  compared to the two-color arrays from agilent. overall, affymetrix data had a slightly higher level of concordance with sample-matched real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  data particularly for detecting small changes in gene expression levels.
