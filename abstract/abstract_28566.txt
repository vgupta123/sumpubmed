BACKGROUND
the y-chromosome  and testosterone  increase blood pressure and may also influence renal electrolyte excretion. therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if the yc combined with t manipulation could influence renal na and k excretion.

methods
to investigate the role of the yc and t, consomic borderline hypertensive  and normotensive wistar-kyoto  rat strains were used  in three t treatment groups: castrate, castrate with t implant and gonadally intact males. urine was collected  for na and k measurements by flame photometry. rt-pcr was used to demonstrate the presence of renal androgen receptor  transcripts. plasma t and aldosterone were measured by ria. in another experiment the androgen receptor was blocked using flutamide in the diet.


RESULTS
na and k excretion were decreased by t in shr/y and wky. ar transcripts were identified in shr/y and wky kidneys. plasma aldosterone was decreased in the presence of t. blockade of the ar resulted in a significant increase in na excretion but not in k excretion in both shr/y and wky males.


CONCLUSIONS
t influences electrolyte excretion through an androgen receptor dependent mechanism. there was not a differential yc involvement in electrolyte excretion between wky and shr/y males.
