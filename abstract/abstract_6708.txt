BACKGROUND
in recent years, the genus pestalotiopsis is receiving increasing attention, not only because of its economic impact as a plant pathogen but also as a commonly isolated endophyte which is an important source of bioactive natural products. pestalotiopsis fici steyaert w106-1/cgmcc <dig>  as an endophyte of tea produces numerous novel secondary metabolites, including chloropupukeananin, a derivative of chlorinated pupukeanane that is first discovered in fungi. some of them might be important as the drug leads for future pharmaceutics.


RESULTS
here, we report the genome sequence of the endophytic fungus of tea pestalotiopsis fici w106-1/cgmcc <dig> . the abundant carbohydrate-active enzymes especially significantly expanding pectinases allow the fungus to utilize the limited intercellular nutrients within the host plants, suggesting adaptation of the fungus to endophytic lifestyle. the p. fici genome encodes a rich set of secondary metabolite synthesis genes, including  <dig> polyketide synthases ,  <dig> non-ribosomal peptide synthases , five dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases, four putative pks-like enzymes,  <dig> putative nrps-like enzymes,  <dig> terpenoid synthases, seven terpenoid cyclases, seven fatty-acid synthases, and five hybrids of pks-nrps. the majority of these core enzymes distributed into  <dig> secondary metabolite clusters. the putative diels-alderase genes have undergone expansion.


CONCLUSIONS
the significant expansion of pectinase encoding genes provides essential insight in the life strategy of endophytes, and richness of gene clusters for secondary metabolites reveals high potential of natural products of endophytic fungi.
