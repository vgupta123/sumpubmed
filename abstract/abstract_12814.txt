BACKGROUND
short-term oe  treatment causes significant decreases in rat weight mainly due to adipose tissue loss. the aim of this work was to determine if oe treatment affects the expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism in white adipose tissue.


RESULTS
gene expression in adipose tissue from female treated rats  was analysed by hybridization to cdna arrays and levels of specific mrnas were determined by real-time pcr. treatment with oe decreased the expression of  <dig> genes and up-regulated  <dig> other genes in mesenteric white adipose tissue. the use of real-time pcr validate that, in mesenteric white adipose tissue, mrna levels for lipoprotein lipase  were decreased by 52%, those of fatty acid synthase  by 95%, those of hormone sensible lipase  by 32%, those of acetyl coa carboxylase  by 92%, those of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b  by 45%, and those of fatty acid transport protein  <dig>  and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein  by 52% and 49%, respectively. conversely, tumour necrosis factor  values showed overexpression .


CONCLUSIONS
short-term treatment with oe affects adipose tissue capacity to extract fatty acids from lipoproteins and to deal with fatty acid transport and metabolism.
