BACKGROUND
gap junction protein and extracellular matrix signalling systems act in concert to influence developmental specification of neural stem and progenitor cells. it is not known how these two signalling systems interact. here, we examined the role of ecm components in regulating connexin expression and function in postnatal hippocampal progenitor cells.


RESULTS
we found that cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig> mrna and protein but only cx <dig> and cx <dig> mrna are detected in distinct neural progenitor cell populations cultured in the absence of exogenous ecm. multipotential type  <dig> cells express cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig> protein. their type 2a progeny but not type 2b and  <dig> neuronally committed progenitor cells additionally express cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  cx <dig> and cx <dig> protein is detected in early oligodendrocyte progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes respectively. engagement with a laminin substrate markedly increases cx <dig> protein expression, decreases cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig> protein expression, and alters subcellular localization of cx <dig>  these changes are associated with decreased neurogenesis. further, laminin elicits the appearance of cx <dig> protein in early oligodendrocyte progenitors and cx <dig> protein in immature neurons. these changes impact upon functional connexin-mediated hemichannel activity but not gap junctional intercellular communication.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these findings demonstrate a new role for extracellular matrix-cell interaction, specifically laminin, in the regulation of intrinsic connexin expression and function in postnatal neural progenitor cells.
