BACKGROUND
hemophilia a is a bleeding disorder caused by deficiency in coagulation factor viii. recombinant factor viii  is an alternative to plasma-derived fviii for the treatment of hemophilia a. however, commercial manufacturing of rfviii products is inefficient and costly and is associated to high prices and product shortage, even in economically privileged countries. this situation may be solved by adopting more efficient production methods. here, we evaluated the potential of transient transfection in producing rfviii in serum-free suspension hek  <dig> cell cultures and investigated the effects of different dna concentration  and repeated transfections done at 34° and 37°c.


RESULTS
we observed a decrease in cell growth when high dna concentrations were used, but no significant differences in transfection efficiency and in the biological activity of the rfviii were noticed. the best condition for rfviii production was obtained with repeated transfections at 34°c using  <dig>  μg dna/ <dig> cells through which almost  <dig> iu of active rfviii was produced six days post-transfection.


CONCLUSIONS
serum-free suspension transient transfection is thus a viable option for high-yield-rfviii production. work is in progress to further optimize the process and validate its scalability.
