BACKGROUND
the goal of this study was to investigate the anti-angiogenic activity of a novel peptide h-rn, derived from the hepatocyte growth factor kringle  <dig> domain , in a mouse model of corneal neovascularization. the anti-angiogenic effect of h-rn on vascular endothelial growth factor -stimulated cell proliferation, cell migration and endothelial cell tube formation was assessed in vitro using human umbilical vein endothelial cells  and in vivo using a mouse cornea micropocket assay. apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were assessed by flow cytometry. a scrambled peptide was used as a negative control.


RESULTS
h-rn effectively inhibited vegf-stimulated huvec proliferation, migration and tube formation on matrigel, while a scrambled peptide exerted no effect. in the mouse model of corneal angiogenesis, vegf-stimulated angiogenesis was significantly inhibited by h-rn compared to a scrambled peptide that had no such activity. vegf protected huvecs from apoptosis, while h-rn inhibited this protective effect of vegf. vegf significantly increased the proportion of cells in the s phase compared to control treated cells . treatment with h-rn  induced the accumulation of cells in g0/g <dig> phase, while the proportion of cells in the s phase and g2/m phase decreased significantly compared to control group .


CONCLUSIONS
h-rn has anti-angiogenic activity in huvecs and in a mouse model of vegf-induced corneal neovascularization. the anti-angiogenic activity of h-rn was related to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, indicating a potential strategy for anti-angiogenic treatment in the cornea.
