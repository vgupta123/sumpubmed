BACKGROUND
the b cell antigen receptor  is a signaling complex that mediates the differentiation of stage-specific cell fate decisions in b lymphocytes. while several studies have shown differences in signal transduction components as being key to contrasting phenotypic outcomes, little is known about the differential bcr-triggered gene transcription downstream of the signaling cascades.


RESULTS
here we define the transcriptional changes that underlie bcr-induced apoptosis and proliferation of immature and mature b cells, respectively. comparative genome-wide expression profiling identified  <dig> genes that discriminated between the early responses of the two cell types to bcr stimulation. using mice with a conditional myc-deletion, we validated the microarray data by demonstrating that myc is critical to promoting bcr-triggered b-cell proliferation. we further investigated the myc-dependent molecular mechanisms and found that myc promotes a bcr-dependent clonal expansion of mature b cells by inducing proliferation and inhibiting differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the early transcriptional events that lead to either deletion or clonal expansion of b cells upon antigen recognition, and demonstrates that myc functions as the hub of a transcriptional network that control b-cell fate in the periphery.
