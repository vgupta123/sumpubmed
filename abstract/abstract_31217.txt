BACKGROUND
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is characterized by cyst formation throughout the kidney parenchyma. it is caused by mutations in either of two genes, pkd <dig> and pkd <dig>  mice that lack functional pkd <dig> , develop rapidly progressive cystic disease during embryogenesis, and serve as a model to study human adpkd. genome wide transcriptome reprogramming and the possible roles of micro-rnas  that affect the initiation and progression of cyst formation in the pkd1-/- have yet to be studied. mirnas are small, regulatory non-coding rnas, implicated in a wide spectrum of biological processes. their expression levels are altered in several diseases including kidney cancer, diabetic nephropathy and pkd.


RESULTS
we examined the molecular pathways that modulate renal cyst formation and growth in the pkd1-/- model by performing global gene-expression profiling in embryonic kidneys at days  <dig>  and  <dig> . gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis were used to identify overrepresented signaling pathways in pkd1-/- kidneys. we found dysregulation of developmental, metabolic, and signaling pathways  in pkd1-/- kidneys. using a comparative transcriptomics approach, we determined similarities and differences with human adpkd: ~50% overlap at the pathway level among the mis-regulated pathways was observed. by using computational approaches , we then predicted mirnas that were suggested to target the differentially expressed mrnas. differential expressions of  <dig> candidate mirnas, mirs-10a, -30a-5p, - <dig>  -126-5p, - <dig>  -200a, - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  and  <dig> genes were confirmed by qpcr. in addition,  <dig> candidate mirna:mrna reciprocal interactions were predicted. several of the highly regulated genes and pathways were predicted as targets of mirnas.


CONCLUSIONS
we have described global transcriptional reprogramming during the progression of pkd in the pkd1-/- model. we propose a model for the cascade of signaling events involved in cyst formation and growth. our results suggest that several mirnas may be involved in regulating signaling pathways in adpkd. we further describe novel putative mirna:mrna signatures in adpkd, which will provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of this common genetic disease in humans.
