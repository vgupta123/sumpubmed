BACKGROUND
odorant binding proteins  are believed to shuttle odorants from the environment to the underlying odorant receptors, for which they could potentially serve as odorant presenters. although several sequence based search methods have been exploited for protein family prediction, less effort has been devoted to the prediction of obps from sequence data and this area is more challenging due to poor sequence identity between these proteins.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a new algorithm that uses regularized least squares classifier  in conjunction with multiple physicochemical properties of amino acids to predict odorant-binding proteins. the algorithm was applied to the dataset derived from pfam and gendis database and we obtained overall prediction accuracy of  <dig> % .


CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that rlsc is potentially useful for predicting the odorant binding proteins from sequence-derived properties irrespective of sequence similarity. our method predicts  <dig> % of  <dig> odorant binding proteins non-homologous to any protein in the swissprot database and  <dig> % of the  <dig> independent dataset proteins, suggesting the usefulness of rlsc method for facilitating the prediction of odorant binding proteins from sequence information.
