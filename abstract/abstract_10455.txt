BACKGROUND
the dexd/h domain containing rna helicases such as retinoic acid-inducible gene i  and melanoma differentiation-associated gene  <dig>  are key cytosolic pattern recognition receptors  for detecting nucleotide pathogen associated molecular patterns  of invading viruses. the rig-i and mda <dig> proteins differentially recognise conserved pamps in double stranded or single stranded viral rna molecules, leading to activation of the interferon system in vertebrates. they share three core protein domains including a rna helicase domain near the c terminus , one or more caspase activation and recruitment domains  and an atp dependent dexd/h domain. the rig-i/mda <dig> directed interferon response is negatively regulated by laboratory of genetics and physiology  <dig>  and is believed to be controlled by the mitochondria antiviral signalling protein , a card containing protein associated with mitochondria.


RESULTS
the dexd/h containing rna helicases including rig-i, mda <dig> and lgp <dig> were analysed in silico in a wide spectrum of invertebrate and vertebrate genomes. the gene synteny of mda <dig> and lgp <dig> is well conserved among vertebrates whilst conservation of the gene synteny of rig-i is less apparent. invertebrate homologues had a closer phylogenetic relationship with the vertebrate rig-is than the mda5/lgp <dig> molecules, suggesting the rig-i homologues may have emerged earlier in evolution, possibly prior to the appearance of vertebrates. our data suggest that the rig-i like helicases possibly originated from three distinct genes coding for the core domains including the helicc, card and atp dependent dexd/h domains through gene fusion and gene/domain duplication. furthermore, presence of domains similar to a prokaryotic dna restriction enzyme iii domain , and a zinc finger domain of transcription factor  iis have been detected by bioinformatic analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the rig-i/mda <dig> viral surveillance system is conserved in vertebrates. the rig-i like helicase family appears to have evolved from a common ancestor that originated from genes encoding different core functional domains. diversification of core functional domains might be fundamental to their functional divergence in terms of recognition of different viral pamps.
