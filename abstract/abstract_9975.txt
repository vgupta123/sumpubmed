BACKGROUND
there is a critical need for proven drugs other than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of degenerative joint disease  pain in dogs. antibodies against nerve growth factor  are analgesic in rodent models and in humans with djd. this pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel caninised anti-ngf antibody  for the treatment of djd pain in dogs. in a randomized, parallel group, stratified, double masked, placebo controlled, proof of principle clinical pilot study design,  <dig> dogs with djd received nv- <dig>  or placebo on day  <dig> . in addition to objective accelerometry measures, owners completed clinical metrology instruments  on d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  cbpi subscales , csom and load scores were evaluated within and between groups for change over time. recognized success/failure criteria were applied and success compared between groups.


RESULTS
cbpi ps and pi scores significantly improved in the nv- <dig> group  but not in the placebo group. csom scores showed similar patterns with a significant difference between within-group changes at d <dig> and d <dig> , and significantly more successes at d <dig> . load scores significantly improved in the nv- <dig> group  but not in the placebo group. there were significant differences between the groups for change in load score at d <dig>  and d <dig> . no side effects were noted. activity in the nv- <dig> group increased over the study period compared to placebo  and the difference between the groups for change in activity over the time period 9am-5pm  was significant .


CONCLUSIONS
these pilot data demonstrate a positive analgesic effect of anti-ngf antibody in dogs suffering from chronic pain. the magnitude of the effect appeared identical to that expected with an nsaid.
