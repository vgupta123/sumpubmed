BACKGROUND
transposable elements  have the potential to produce broad changes in the genomes of their hosts, acting as a type of evolutionary toolbox and generating a collection of new regulatory and coding sequences. several te classes have been studied in neotropical cichlids; however, the information gained from these studies is restricted to the physical chromosome mapping, whereas the genetic diversity of the tes remains unknown. therefore, the genomic organization of the non-ltr retrotransposons rex <dig>  rex <dig>  and rex <dig> in five amazonian cichlid species was evaluated using physical chromosome mapping and dna sequencing to provide information about the role of tes in the evolution of cichlid genomes.


RESULTS
physical mapping revealed abundant te clusters dispersed throughout the chromosomes. furthermore, several species showed conspicuous clusters accumulation in the centromeric and terminal portions of the chromosomes. these te chromosomal sites are associated with both heterochromatic and euchromatic regions. a higher number of rex <dig> clusters were observed among the derived species. the rex <dig> and rex <dig> nucleotide sequences were more conserved in the basal species than in the derived species; however, this pattern was not observed in rex <dig>  in addition, it was possible to observe conserved blocks corresponding to the reverse transcriptase fragment of the rex <dig> and rex <dig> clones and to the endonuclease of rex <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data showed no congruence between the bayesian trees generated for rex <dig>  rex <dig> and rex <dig> of cichlid species and phylogenetic hypothesis described for the group. rex <dig> and rex <dig> nucleotide sequences were more conserved in the basal species whereas rex <dig> exhibited high substitution rates in both basal and derived species. the distribution of rex elements in cichlid genomes suggests that such elements are under the action of evolutionary mechanisms that lead to their accumulation in particular chromosome regions, mostly in heterochromatins.
