BACKGROUND
geminiviruses  are small single-stranded  dna viruses infecting plants. their virion morphology is unique in the known viral world â€“ two incomplete t =  <dig> icosahedra are joined together to form twinned particles. geminiviruses utilize a rolling-circle mode to replicate their genomes. a limited sequence similarity between the three conserved motifs of the rolling-circle replication initiation proteins  of geminiviruses and plasmids of gram-positive bacteria allowed koonin and ilyina to propose that geminiviruses descend from bacterial replicons.


RESULTS
phylogenetic and clustering analyses of various rcr reps suggest that rep proteins of geminiviruses share a most recent common ancestor with reps encoded on plasmids of phytoplasmas, parasitic wall-less bacteria replicating both in plant and insect cells and therefore occupying a common ecological niche with geminiviruses. capsid protein of satellite tobacco necrosis virus was found to be the best template for homology-based structural modeling of the geminiviral capsid protein. good stereochemical quality of the generated models indicates that the geminiviral capsid protein shares the same structural fold, the viral jelly-roll, with the vast majority of icosahedral plant-infecting ssrna viruses.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a plasmid-to-virus transition scenario, where a phytoplasmal plasmid acquired a capsid-coding gene from a plant rna virus to give rise to the ancestor of geminiviruses.
