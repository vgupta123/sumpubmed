BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug-resistant bacterium responsible for nosocomial infections in hospitals worldwide. study of mutant phenotypes is fundamental for understanding gene function. the methodologies developed to inactivate a. baumannii genes are complicated and time-consuming; sometimes result in unstable mutants, and do not enable construction of double  gene knockout mutant strains of a. baumannii.


RESULTS
we describe here a rapid and simple method of obtaining a. baumannii mutants by gene replacement via double crossover recombination, by use of a pcr product that carries an antibiotic resistance cassette flanked by regions homologous to the target locus. to demonstrate the reproducibility of the approach, we produced mutants of three different chromosomal genes  by this method. in addition, we disrupted one of these genes  by integration of a plasmid into the chromosome by single crossover recombination, the most widely used method of obtaining a. baumannii mutants. comparison of the different techniques revealed absolute stability when the gene was replaced by a double recombination event, whereas up to 40% of the population reverted to wild-type when the plasmid was disrupting the target gene after  <dig> passages in broth without selective pressure. moreover, we demonstrate that the combination of both gene disruption and gene replacement techniques is an easy and useful procedure for obtaining double gene knockout mutants in a. baumannii.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a rapid and simple method of obtaining stable mutants of a. baumannii free of foreign plasmidic dna, which does not require cloning steps, and enables construction of multiple gene knockout mutants.
