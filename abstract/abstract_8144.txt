BACKGROUND
salmonella is a widely distributed foodborne pathogen that causes tens of millions of salmonellosis cases globally every year. while the genomic diversity of salmonella is increasingly well studied, our knowledge of salmonella phage genomic diversity is still rather limited, despite the contributions of both lysogenic and lytic phages to salmonella virulence, diversity and ecology . to gain a better understanding of phage diversity in a specific ecological niche, we sequenced  <dig> salmonella phages isolated from a number of dairy farms from new york state  and analyzed them using a comparative genomics approach.


RESULTS
classification of the  <dig> phages according to the presence/absence of orthologous genes allowed for classification into  <dig> well supported clusters. in addition to two phage clusters that represent novel virulent salmonella phages, we also identified four phage clusters that each contained previously characterized phages from multiple continents. our analyses also identified two clusters of phages that carry putative virulence  and antimicrobial resistance  genes as well as virulent and temperate transducing phages. insights into phage evolution from our analyses include  identification of dna metabolism genes that may facilitate nucleotide synthesis in phages with a g+c % distinct from salmonella, and  evidence of salmonella phage tailspike and fiber diversity due to both single nucleotide polymorphisms and major re-arrangements, which may affect the host specificity of salmonella phages.


CONCLUSIONS
genomics-based characterization of  <dig> salmonella phages isolated from dairy farms allowed for identification of a number of novel salmonella phages. while the comparative genomics analyses of these phages provide a number of new insights in the evolution and diversity of salmonella phages, they only represent a first glimpse into the diversity of salmonella phages that is likely to be discovered when phages from different environments are characterized.
