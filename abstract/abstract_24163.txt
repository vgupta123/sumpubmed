BACKGROUND
lipoprotein lipase  hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins and makes fatty acids available for tissue metabolism. the activity of the enzyme is modulated in a tissue specific manner by interaction with other proteins. we have studied how feeding/fasting and some related perturbations affect the expression, in rat adipose tissue, of three such proteins, lmf <dig>  an er protein necessary for folding of lpl into its active dimeric form, the endogenous lpl inhibitor angptl <dig>  and gpihbp <dig>  that transfers lpl across the endothelium.


RESULTS
the system underwent moderate circadian oscillations, for lpl in phase with food intake, for angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> in the opposite direction. studies with cycloheximide showed that whereas lpl protein turns over rapidly, angptl <dig> protein turns over more slowly. studies with the transcription blocker actinomycin d showed that transcripts for angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig>  but not lmf <dig> or lpl, turn over rapidly. when food was withdrawn the expression of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> increased rapidly, and lpl activity decreased. on re-feeding and after injection of insulin the expression of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> decreased rapidly, and lpl activity increased. in angptl4−/− mice adipose tissue lpl activity did not show these responses. in old, obese rats that showed signs of insulin resistance, the responses of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna and of lpl activity were severely blunted  or almost abolished .


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates directly that angptl <dig> is necessary for rapid modulation of lpl activity in adipose tissue. angptl <dig> message levels responded very rapidly to changes in the nutritional state. lpl activity always changed in the opposite direction. this did not happen in angptl4−/− mice. gpihbp <dig> message levels also changed rapidly and in the same direction as angptl <dig>  i.e. increased on fasting when lpl activity decreased. this was unexpected because gpihbp <dig> is known to stabilize lpl. the plasticity of the lpl system is severely blunted or completely lost in insulin resistant rats.
