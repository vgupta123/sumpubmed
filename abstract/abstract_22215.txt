BACKGROUND
the comparative toxicogenomics database  is a publicly available resource that promotes understanding about the etiology of environmental diseases. it provides manually curated chemical-gene/protein interactions and chemical- and gene-disease relationships from the peer-reviewed, published literature. the goals of the research reported here were to establish a baseline analysis of current ctd curation, develop a text-mining prototype from readily available open source components, and evaluate its potential value in augmenting curation efficiency and increasing data coverage.


RESULTS
prototype text-mining applications were developed and evaluated using a ctd data set consisting of manually curated molecular interactions and relationships from  <dig>  documents. preliminary results indicated that the prototype found 80% of the gene, chemical, and disease terms appearing in curated interactions. these terms were used to re-rank documents for curation, resulting in increases in mean average precision , and in the correlation coefficient of rank vs. number of curatable interactions per document .


CONCLUSIONS
this text-mining project is unique in its integration of existing tools into a single workflow with direct application to ctd. we performed a baseline assessment of the inter-curator consistency and coverage in ctd, which allowed us to measure the potential of these integrated tools to improve prioritization of journal articles for manual curation. our study presents a feasible and cost-effective approach for developing a text mining solution to enhance manual curation throughput and efficiency.
