BACKGROUND
endogenous small  rnas  are important trans/cis-acting regulators involved in diverse cellular functions. in plants, the rna-dependent rna polymerases  are essential for smrna biogenesis. it has been established that rdr <dig> is involved in the 24 nt sirna-dependent rna-directed dna methylation  pathway. recent studies have suggested that rdr <dig> is involved in a second rddm pathway that relies mostly on 21 nt smrnas and functions to silence a subset of genomic loci that are usually refractory to the normal rddm pathway in arabidopsis. whether and to what extent the homologs of rdr <dig> may have similar functions in other plants remained unknown.


RESULTS
we characterized a loss-of-function mutant  of the osrdr <dig> gene in rice  derived from a retrotransposon tos <dig> insertion. microarray analysis identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  between osrdr <dig> and wt, of which  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in osrdr <dig>  smrna sequencing revealed regional alterations in smrna clusters across the rice genome. some of the regions with altered smrna clusters were associated with changes in dna methylation. in addition, altered expression of several mirnas was detected in osrdr <dig>  and at least some of which were associated with altered expression of predicted mirna target genes. despite these changes, no phenotypic difference was identified in osrdr <dig> relative to wt under normal condition; however, ephemeral phenotypic fluctuations occurred under some abiotic stress conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that osrdr <dig> plays a role in regulating a substantial number of endogenous genes with diverse functions in rice through smrna-mediated pathways involving dna methylation, and which participates in abiotic stress response.
