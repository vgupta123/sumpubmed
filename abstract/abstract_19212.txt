BACKGROUND
the burkholderia cepacia complex  is a versatile group of gram negative organisms that can be found throughout the environment in sources such as soil, water, and plants. while bcc bacteria can be involved in beneficial interactions with plants, they are also considered opportunistic pathogens, specifically in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease. these organisms also exhibit resistance to many antibiotics, making conventional treatment often unsuccessful. ks <dig> was isolated as a prophage of b. cenocepacia k56- <dig>  a clinically relevant strain of the bcc. our objective was to sequence the genome of this phage and also determine if this prophage encoded any virulence determinants.


RESULTS
ks <dig> is a  <dig>  base pairs  transposable phage of the opportunistic pathogen burkholderia cenocepacia. genome sequence analysis and annotation of this phage reveals that ks <dig> shows the closest sequence homology to mu and bcepmu. ks <dig> was found to be a prophage in three different strains of b. cenocepacia, including strains k56- <dig>  j <dig>  and c <dig>  and seven tested clinical isolates of b. cenocepacia, but no other bcc species. a survey of  <dig> strains and  <dig> clinical isolates of the bcc revealed that ks <dig> is able to form plaques on lawns of b. ambifaria lmg  <dig>  b. cenocepacia pc <dig>  and b. stabilis lmg  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
ks <dig> is a novel phage with a genomic organization that differs from most phages in that its capsid genes are not aligned into one module but rather separated by approximately  <dig> kb, giving evidence of one or more prior genetic rearrangements. there were no potential virulence factors identified in ks <dig>  though many hypothetical proteins were identified with no known function.
