BACKGROUND
approximately 20 % of obese dogs have metabolic disturbances similar to those observed in human metabolic syndrome, a condition known as obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. this condition is associated with insulin resistance and decreased circulating adiponectin concentrations, but clinical consequences have not been reported. in order to define better the metabolic changes associated with obesity-related metabolic dysfunction , we compared the plasma proteomes of obese dogs with and without ormd.

a proteomic analysis was conducted on plasma samples from  <dig> obese male dogs,  <dig> with ormd and  <dig> without ormd. the samples were first treated for the depletion of high-abundance proteins and subsequently analysed by using 2-de dige methodology.


RESULTS
using mass spectrometry,  <dig> proteins were identified: albumin, apoliprotein a-i, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c4bpa, a2m, uncharacterised protein  os = canis familiaris, fibrinogen, igj, itih <dig>  and glutathione peroxidase. in obese dogs with ormd, the relative amounts of ten proteins  os = canis familiaris, fibrinogen, and itih2) were increased and two proteins  were decreased, compared with obese dogs without ormd. specific assays were then used to confirm differences in serum albumin, apoliprotein a-i and glutathione peroxidase in a separate group of  <dig> overweight dogs,  <dig> with ormd and  <dig> without ormd.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study provides evidence that, in obese dogs with ormd, there are changes in expression of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, immune response, and antioxidant status. the clinical significance of these changes remains to be defined.
