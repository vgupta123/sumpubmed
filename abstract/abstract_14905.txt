BACKGROUND
the dwarfing gene sdw <dig> has been widely used throughout the world to develop commercial barley varieties. there are at least four different alleles at the sdw <dig> locus.


RESULTS
mutations in the gibberellin 20-oxidase gene  resulted in multiple alleles at the sdw <dig> locus. the sdw <dig> d allele from diamant is due to a 7-bp deletion in exon  <dig>  while the sdw <dig> c allele from abed denso has 1-bp deletion and a 4-bp insertion in the 5’ untranslated region. the sdw <dig> a allele from jotun resulted from a total deletion of the hvga20ox <dig> gene. the structural changes result in lower gene expression in sdw <dig> d and lack of expression in sdw <dig> a. there are three hvga20ox genes in the barley genome. the partial or total loss of function of the hvga20ox <dig> gene could be compensated by enhanced expression of its homolog hvga20ox1and hvga20ox <dig>  a diagnostic molecular marker was developed to differentiate between the wild-type, sdw <dig> d and sdw <dig> a alleles and another molecular marker for differentiation of sdw <dig> c and sdw <dig> a. the markers were further tested in  <dig> barley varieties, out of which  <dig> had the sdw <dig> d allele and two varieties the sdw <dig> a allele. to date, the sdw <dig> d and sdw <dig> a alleles have only been detected in the modern barley varieties and lines.


CONCLUSIONS
the results provided further proof that the gibberellin 20-oxidase gene  is the functional gene of the barley sdw <dig> mutants. different deletions resulted in different functional alleles for different breeding purposes. truncated protein could maintain partial function. partial or total loss of function of the hvga20ox <dig> gene could be compensated by enhanced expression of its homolog hvga20ox <dig> and hvga20ox <dig>
