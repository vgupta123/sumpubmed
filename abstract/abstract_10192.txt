BACKGROUND
the type iii secretion system  is an important virulence determinant of gram-negative bacterial pathogens. it enables the injection of effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. these effectors ultimately manipulate the cellular functions of the infected organism. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium encodes two virulence associated ttsss encoded by the salmonella pathogenicity islands   <dig> and  <dig> that are required for the intestinal and systemic phases of the infection, respectively. however, recent studies suggest that the roles of these ttsss are not restricted to these compartments. the regulation of ttsss in salmonella is very complex with several regulators operating to activate or to repress expression depending on the environmental conditions.


RESULTS
we performed a systematic analysis of the regulation of type iii effectors during growth in vitro. we have tested the ability of seven regulatory genes to regulate ten effector genes. each regulator was expressed in the absence of the other six to avoid cascade effects. our results confirm and extend the previously reported regulation of ttss <dig> and ttss <dig> effectors by invf-sica and ssrb respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the set of strains constructed for this study can be used to quickly and systematically study the regulation of newly identified effector genes of salmonella enterica. the approach we have used can also be applied to study complex regulatory cascades in other bacterial species.
