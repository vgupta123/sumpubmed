BACKGROUND
previous research indicates that the membrane ruffles and leading edge of lamellipodia of myogenic cells contain presumptive fusion sites. a micrometer-sized lipid raft  is organized at the presumptive fusion site of mouse myogenic cells in a cell-contact independent way and serves as a platform tethering adhesion proteins that are relevant to cell fusion. however, the mechanisms underlying recruitment of adhesion proteins to lipid rafts and microraft organization remain unknown.


RESULTS
here we show that small g-protein rac <dig> was required for microraft organization and subsequent cell fusion. however, rac <dig> activity was unnecessary for recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts. we found that p <dig> catenin  binds to m-cadherin exclusively in lipid rafts of differentiating myogenic cells. the src kinase inhibitor su <dig> prevented p <dig> binding to m-cadherin and their recruitment to lipid rafts, then suppressed microraft organization, membrane ruffling, and myogenic cell fusion. suppression of membrane ruffling in su6656-treated cells was partially restored by pretreatment with the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate. the present analyses using an antibody to tyrosine phosphorylated p <dig> suggest that src family kinases play a role in binding of p <dig> to m-cadherin and the recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts through phosphorylation of putative substrates other than p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the present study showed that the procedure establishing fusion-competent sites consists of two sequential events: recruitment of adhesion complexes to lipid rafts and organization of microrafts. the recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts depended on interaction with p <dig> catenin, whereas the organization of microrafts was controlled by a small g protein, rac <dig>
