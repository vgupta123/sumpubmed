BACKGROUND
differentiation of the brain during development leads to sexually dimorphic adult reproductive behavior and other neural sex dimorphisms. genetic mechanisms independent of steroid hormones produced by the gonads have recently been suggested to partly explain these dimorphisms.


RESULTS
using cdna microarrays and real-time pcr we found gene expression differences between the male and female embryonic brain  that may be independent of morphological differentiation of the gonads. genes located on the sex chromosomes  were common among the differentially expressed genes, several of which  have previously been implicated in avian sex determination. a majority of the identified genes were more highly expressed in males. three of these genes  encode subunits of the transcription factor iih complex, indicating a role for this complex in neuronal differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study provides novel insights into sexually dimorphic gene expression in the embryonic chicken brain and its possible involvement in sex differentiation of the nervous system in birds.
