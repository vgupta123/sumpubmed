BACKGROUND
granulocyte colony-stimulating  factor is a well-known hematopoietic growth factor stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitors. recently, we uncovered that g-csf acts also as a neuronal growth factor in the brain, which promotes adult neural precursor differentiation and enhances regeneration of the brain after insults. in adults, the receptor for g-csf is predominantly expressed in neurons in many brain areas. we also described expression in neurogenic regions of the adult brain, such as the subventricular zone and the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. in addition, we found close co-localization of the g-csf receptor and its ligand g-csf. here we have conducted a systematic expression analysis of g-csf receptor and its ligand in the developing embryo.


RESULTS
outside the central nervous system  we found g-csf receptor expression in blood vessels, muscles and their respective precursors and neurons. the expression of the g-csf receptor in the developing cns was most prominent in radial glia cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data imply that in addition to the function of g-csf and its receptor in adult neurogenesis, this system also has a role in embryonic neurogenesis and nervous system development.
