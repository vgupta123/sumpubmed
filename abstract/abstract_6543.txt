BACKGROUND
how to compare studies on the basis of their biological significance is a problem of central importance in high-throughput genomics. many methods for performing such comparisons are based on the information in databases of functional annotation, such as those that form the gene ontology . typically, they consist of analyzing gene annotation frequencies in some pre-specified go classes, in a class-by-class way, followed by p-value adjustment for multiple testing. enrichment analysis, where a list of genes is compared against a wider universe of genes, is the most common example.


RESULTS
a new global testing procedure and a method incorporating it are presented. instead of testing separately for each go class, a single global test for all classes under consideration is performed. the test is based on the distance between the functional profiles, defined as the joint frequencies of annotation in a given set of go classes. these classes may be chosen at one or more go levels. the new global test is more powerful and accurate with respect to type i errors than the usual class-by-class approach. when applied to some real datasets, the results suggest that the method may also provide useful information that complements the tests performed using a class-by-class approach if gene counts are sparse in some classes. an r library, goprofiles, implements these methods and is available from bioconductor, http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goprofiles.html.


CONCLUSIONS
the method provides an inferential basis for deciding whether two lists are functionally different. for global comparisons it is preferable to the global chi-square test of homogeneity. furthermore, it may provide additional information if used in conjunction with class-by-class methods.
