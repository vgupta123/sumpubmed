BACKGROUND
although many hyperthermophilic endoglucanases have been reported from archaea and bacteria, a complete survey and classification of all sequences in these species from disparate evolutionary groups, and the relationship between their molecular structures and functions are lacking. the completion of several high-quality gene or genome sequencing projects provided us with the unique opportunity to make a complete assessment and thorough comparative analysis of the hyperthermophilic endoglucanases encoded in archaea and bacteria.


RESULTS
structure alignment of the  <dig> hyperthermophilic endoglucanases from archaea and bacteria which grow above 80Â°c revealed that gly <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig>  trp <dig>  glu <dig>  met <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig>  gly <dig> and glu <dig> are conserved amino acid residues. in addition, the average percentage composition of residues cysteine and histidine of  <dig> endoglucanases is only  <dig>  and  <dig>  while it is high in thermophilic or mesophilic one. it can be inferred from the nodes that there is a close relationship among the  <dig> protein from hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea based on phylogenetic analysis. among these conserved amino acid residues, as far as cel12b concerned, two glu residues might be the catalytic nucleophile and proton donor, gly <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig> and gly <dig> residues might be necessary to the thermostability of protein, and trp <dig>  met <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig> residues is related to the binding of substrate. site-directed mutagenesis results reveal that pro <dig> and pro <dig> contribute to the thermostability of cel12b and met <dig> is confirmed to have role in enhancing the binding of substrate.


CONCLUSIONS
the conserved acids have been shown great importance to maintain the structure, thermostability, as well as the similarity of the enzymatic properties of those proteins. we have made clear the function of these conserved amino acid residues in cel12b protein, which is helpful in analyzing other undetailed molecular structure and transforming them with site directed mutagenesis, as well as providing the theoretical basis for degrading cellulose from woody and herbaceous plants.
