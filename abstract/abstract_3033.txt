BACKGROUND
transgenic strains of caenorhabditis elegans are typically generated by injecting dna into the germline to form multi-copy extrachromosomal arrays. these transgenes are semi-stable and their expression is silenced in the germline. mos <dig> transposon or microparticle bombardment methods have been developed to create single- or low-copy chromosomal integrated lines. here we report an alternative method using ultraviolet trimethylpsoralen  to generate single/low-copy gene integrations.


RESULTS
we successfully integrated low-copy transgenes from extrachromosomal arrays using positive selection based on temperature sensitivity with a vps- <dig> rescue fragment and negative selection based on benzimidazole sensitivity with a ben- <dig> rescue fragment. we confirmed that the integrants express transgenes in the germline. quantitative pcr revealed that strains generated by this method contain single- or low-copy transgenes. moreover, positive selection marker genes flanked by loxp sites were excised by cre recombinase mrna microinjection, demonstrating cre-mediated chromosomal excision for the first time in c. elegans.


CONCLUSIONS
our uv/tmp integration method, based on familiar extrachromosomal transgenics, provides a useful approach for generating single/low-copy gene integrations.
