BACKGROUND
parkinson's disease  is caused by degeneration of dopamine  neurons in the ventral midbrain  and results in severely disturbed regulation of movement. the disease inflicts considerable suffering for the affected and their families. today, the opportunities for pharmacological treatment are meager and new technologies are needed. previous studies have indicated that activation of the nuclear receptor retinoid x receptor  provides trophic support for da neurons. detailed investigations of these neurotrophic effects have been hampered by the lack of readily available da neurons in vitro. the aim of this study was to further describe the potential neurotrophic actions of rxr ligands and, for this and future purposes, develop a suitable in vitro-platform using mouse embryonic stem cells .


RESULTS
we studied the potential neurotrophic effects of the rxr ligand lg <dig>  and the rxr-nurr <dig> ligand xct <dig>  in neuronal cultures derived from rat primary vmb and mescs. rxr ligands protect da neurons from stress, such as that induced by the pd-modeling toxin 6-hydroxy dopamine  and hypoxia, but not from stress induced by oxidative hydrogen peroxide  or the excitotoxic agent kainic acid . the neurotrophic effect is selective for da neurons. da neurons from rat primary vmb and mescs behaved similarly, but the mesc-derived cultures contained a much higher fraction of da cells and thus provided more accessible experimental conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
rxr ligands rescue da neurons from degeneration caused by the pd simulating 6-ohda as well as hypoxia. thus, rxr is a novel promising target for pd research. mesc-derived da cells provide a valid and accessible in vitro-platform for studying pd inducing toxins and potential trophic agents.
