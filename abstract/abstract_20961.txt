BACKGROUND
the expression of glucocorticoid-receptor  seems to be a key mechanism in the regulation of glucocorticoid  sensitivity and is potentially involved in cases of gc resistance or hypersensitivity. the aim of this study is to describe a method for quantitation of gr alpha isoform  expression using real-time pcr  with analytical capabilities to monitor patients, offering standard-curve reproducibility as well as intra- and inter-assay precision.


RESULTS
standard-curves were constructed by employing standardized jurkat cell culture procedures, both for grα and bcr , as a normalizing gene. we evaluated standard-curves using five different sets of cell culture passages, rna extraction, reverse transcription, and qrt-pcr quantification. intra-assay precision was evaluated using  <dig> replicates of each gene, for  <dig> patients, in a single experiment. inter-assay precision was evaluated on  <dig> experiments, using duplicate tests of each gene for two patients. standard-curves were reproducible, with cv  of less than 11%, and pearson correlation coefficients above  <dig>  for most comparisons. intra-assay and inter-assay were 2% and 7%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first method for quantitation of grα expression with technical characteristics that permit patient monitoring, in a fast, simple and robust way.
