BACKGROUND
within the subfamily murinae, african murines represent 25% of species biodiversity, making this group ideal for detailed studies of the patterns and timing of diversification of the african endemic fauna and its relationships with asia. here we report the results of phylogenetic analyses of the endemic african murines through a broad sampling of murine diversity from all their distribution area, based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the two nuclear gene fragments .


RESULTS
a combined analysis of one mitochondrial and two nuclear gene sequences consistently identified and robustly supported ten primary lineages within murinae. we propose to formalize a new tribal arrangement within the murinae that reflects this phylogeny. the diverse african murine assemblage includes members of five of the ten tribes and clearly derives from multiple faunal exchanges between africa and eurasia. molecular dating analyses using a relaxed bayesian molecular clock put the first colonization of africa around  <dig> mya, which is consistent with the fossil record. the main period of african murine diversification occurred later following disruption of the migration route between africa and asia about 7– <dig> mya. a second period of interchange, dating to around 5– <dig>  mya, saw the arrival in africa of mus , and explains the appearance of several distinctive african lineages in the late miocene and pliocene fossil record of eurasia.


CONCLUSIONS
our molecular survey of murinae, which includes the most complete sampling so far of african taxa, indicates that there were at least four separate radiations within the african region, as well as several phases of dispersal between asia and africa during the last  <dig> my. we also reconstruct the phylogenetic structure of the murinae, and propose a new classification at tribal level for this traditionally problematic group.
