BACKGROUND
an important objective of dna microarray-based gene expression experimentation is determining inter-relationships that exist between differentially expressed genes and biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, signaling pathways, physiologic processes and diseases.


RESULTS
here we describe genemesh, a web-based program that facilitates analysis of dna microarray gene expression data. genemesh relates genes in a query set to categories available in the medical subject headings  hierarchical index. the interface enables hypothesis driven relational analysis to a specific mesh subcategory  or unbiased relational analysis to broader mesh categories . genes found associated with a given mesh category are dynamically linked to facilitate tabular and graphical depiction of entrez gene information, gene ontology information, kegg metabolic pathway diagrams and intermolecular interaction information. expression intensity values of groups of genes that cluster in relation to a given mesh category, gene ontology or pathway can be displayed as heat maps of z score-normalized values. genemesh operates on gene expression data derived from a number of commercial microarray platforms including affymetrix, agilent and illumina.


CONCLUSIONS
genemesh is a versatile web-based tool for testing and developing new hypotheses through relating genes in a query set  to descriptors making up the hierarchical structure of the national library of medicine controlled vocabulary thesaurus, mesh. the system further enhances the discovery process by providing links between sets of genes associated with a given mesh category to a rich set of html linked tabular and graphic information including entrez gene summaries, gene ontologies, intermolecular interactions, overlays of genes onto kegg pathway diagrams and heatmaps of expression intensity values. genemesh is freely available online at http://proteogenomics.musc.edu/genemesh/.
