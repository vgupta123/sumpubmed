BACKGROUND
placenta-derived oestrogens have an impact on the growth and differentiation of the trophoblast, and are involved in processes initiating and facilitating birth. the enzyme that converts androgens into oestrogens, aromatase cytochrome p <dig> , is encoded by the cyp <dig> gene. in the placenta of the cow, expression of cyp <dig> relies on promoter  <dig>  . our recent studies of p <dig>  in vitro and in a human trophoblast cell line  revealed that interactions of placental nuclear protein with the e-box element at position - <dig> are required for full promoter activity. the aim of this work was to identify and characterise the placental e-box -binding protein  as a step towards understanding how the expression of cyp <dig> is regulated in the bovine placenta.


RESULTS
the significance of the e-box was confirmed in cultured primary bovine trophoblasts. we enriched the e-bp from placental nuclear extracts using dna-affinity dynabeads and showed by western blot analysis and supershift emsa experiments that the e-bp is composed of the transcription factors upstream stimulating factor   <dig> and usf <dig>  depletion of the usfs by rnai and expression of a dominant-negative usf mutant, were both associated with a significant decrease in p <dig> -dependent reporter gene expression. furthermore, scatter plot analysis of p <dig>  activity vs. usf binding to the e-box revealed a strong positive correlation between the two parameters.


CONCLUSIONS
from these results we conclude that usf <dig> and usf <dig> are activators of the bovine placenta-specific promoter p <dig>  and thus act in the opposite mode as in the case of the non-orthologous human placenta-specific promoter.
