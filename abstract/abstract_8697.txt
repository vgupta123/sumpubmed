BACKGROUND
protein phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications involved in the regulation of plant growth and development as well as diverse stress response. as a member of the poaceae, brachypodium distachyon l. is a new model plant for wheat and barley as well as several potential biofuel grasses such as switchgrass. vegetative growth is vital for biomass accumulation of plants, but knowledge regarding the role of protein phosphorylation modification during vegetative growth, especially in biofuel plants, is far from comprehensive.


RESULTS
in this study, we carried out the first large-scale phosphoproteome analysis of seedling leaves in brachypodium accession bd <dig> using tio <dig> microcolumns combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  and maxquant software. a total of  <dig> phosphorylation sites in  <dig> phosphoproteins were identified, and these phosphoproteins were implicated in various molecular functions and basic cellular processes by gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analyses. among the  <dig> phosphoproteins identified,  <dig> contained  <dig> to  <dig> phosphorylation sites. conservation analysis showed that  <dig> % of the  <dig> phosphoproteins had phosphorylation orthologs in other plant species. motif-x analysis of the phosphorylation sites identified  <dig> significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs, of which  <dig> were novel phosphorylation motifs. meanwhile, there were  <dig> phosphoproteins with both multiple phosphorylation sites and multiple phosphorylation motifs. in addition, we identified  <dig> phosphorylated transcription factors across  <dig> families and found out  <dig> significantly over-represented transcription factor families . eighty-four protein kinases ,  <dig> protein phosphatases  and  <dig> cesas were recognized as phosphoproteins.


CONCLUSIONS
through a large-scale bioinformatics analysis of the phosphorylation data in seedling leaves, a complicated pks- and pps- centered network related to rapid vegetative growth was deciphered in b. distachyon. we revealed a mapk cascade network that might play the crucial roles during the phosphorylation signal transduction in leaf growth and development. the phosphoproteins and phosphosites identified from our study expanded our knowledge of protein phosphorylation modification in plants, especially in monocots.
