BACKGROUND
fibroblasts, as connective tissue cells, are able to transform into another cell type including smooth muscle cells. α1a-adrenergic receptor  stimulation in rat- <dig> fibroblasts is coupled to camp production. however, the significance of an increase in camp produced by α1a-ar stimulation on proliferation, hypertrophy and differentiation in these cells is not known.


RESULTS
activation of the α1a-ar in rat- <dig> fibroblasts by phenylephrine  inhibited dna synthesis by 67% and blocked the re-entry of 81% of the cells into s phase of the cell cycle. this cell cycle blockage was associated with hypertrophy characterized by an increase in protein synthesis  and cell size. elevation of camp levels decreased both dna and protein synthesis. inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or protein kinase a reversed the antiproliferative effect of camp analogs but not pe; the hypertrophic effect of pe was also not altered. the functional response of rat- <dig> cells to pe was accompanied by increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitors p27kip <dig> and p21cip1/waf <dig>  which function as negative regulators of the cell cycle. stimulation of α1a-ar also upregulated the cell cycle regulatory proteins prb, cyclin d <dig>  cdk  <dig>  cdk  <dig>  and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. the antiproliferative effect of pe was blocked by p27kip <dig> antisense but not sense oligonucleotide. pe also promoted expression of smooth muscle cell differentiation markers  as well as the muscle development marker myod.


CONCLUSIONS
stimulation of α1a-ar promotes cell cycle arrest, hypertrophy and differentiation of rat- <dig> fibroblasts into smooth muscle-like cells and expression of negative cell cycle regulators by a mechanism independent of the camp/pka signaling pathway.
