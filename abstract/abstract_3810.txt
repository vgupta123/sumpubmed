BACKGROUND
the crispr–cas systems in prokaryotes are rna-guided immune systems that target and deactivate foreign nucleic acids. a typical crispr–cas system consists of a crispr array of repeat and spacer units, and a locus of cas genes. the crispr and the cas locus are often located next to each other in the genomes. however, there is no quantitative estimate of the co-location. in addition, ad-hoc studies have shown that some non-crispr genomic elements contain repeat-spacer-like structures and are mistaken as crisprs.


RESULTS
using available genome sequences, we observed that a significant number of genomes have isolated cas loci and/or crisprs. we found that 11%, 22% and 28% of the type i, ii and iii cas loci are isolated , respectively. we identified a large number of genomic elements that superficially reassemble crisprs but don’t contain diverse spacers and have no companion cas genes. we called these elements false-crisprs and further classified them into groups, including tandem repeats and staphylococcus aureus repeat -like elements.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first systematic study to collect and characterize false-crispr elements. we demonstrated that false-crisprs could be used to reduce the false annotation of crisprs, therefore showing them to be useful for improving the annotation of crispr–cas systems.
