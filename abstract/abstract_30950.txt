BACKGROUND
metabolic syndrome is a multi-component disorder associated to a high risk of cardiovascular disease. its etiology is the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including dietary habits. we aimed to identify the target proteins modulated by the long-term consumption of four diets differing in the quality and quantity of lipids in the whole proteome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells .


RESULTS
a randomized, controlled trial conducted within the lipgene study assigned  <dig> mets patients for 12 weeks each to  <dig> of  <dig> diets: a) high-saturated fatty acid , b) high-monounsaturated fatty acid , c) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with placebo  and d) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with long chain  n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids  . we analyzed the changes induced in the proteome of both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of pbmc using 2-d proteomic analysis. sixty-seven proteins were differentially expressed after the long-term consumption of the four diets. the hsfa diet induced the expression of proteins responding to oxidative stress, degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and dna repair. however, hmufa, lfhcc and lfhcc n- <dig> diets down-regulated pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress-related proteins and dna repairing proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
the long-term consumption of hsfa, compared to hmufa, lfhcc and lfhcc n- <dig>  seems to increase the cardiovascular disease  risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, and seem lead to dna damage as a consequence of high oxidative stress.
