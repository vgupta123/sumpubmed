BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  can differentiate into chondroblasts, adipocytes, or osteoblasts under appropriate stimulation. ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor , stimulates growth hormone  secretion, and has both orexigenic and adipogenic effects. this study sought to understand the potential involvement of members of mapk serine/threonine kinases in the ghrelin-induced growth of rabbit mscs .

methods
we applied various concentrations of ghrelin to cultured rbmsc and observed the growth rate of the cells by mtt, changes in the phosphorylation state of erk1/ <dig>  jnk and p <dig>  and the expression levels of alp, runx <dig>  and osterix by wetern blot.


RESULTS
we found that the growth and osteogenic differentiation of ghrelin-treated rbmsc are promoted primarily by phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  and that this phosphorylation, as well p <dig> phosphorylation, is mediated by ghsr.


CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that ghrelin promotes the growth and osteogenic differentiation of rbmsc primarily through the erk1/ <dig> pathway.
