BACKGROUND
intellectual disability  is among the most common global disorders, yet etiology is unknown in ~30% of patients despite clinical assessment. whole genome sequencing  is able to interrogate the entire genome, providing potential to diagnose idiopathic patients.

methods
we conducted wgs on eight children with idiopathic id and brain structural defects, and their normal parents; carrying out an extensive data analyses, using standard and discovery approaches.


RESULTS
we verified de novo pathogenic single nucleotide variants  in arid1b c.1595delg and phf <dig> c.820c > t, potentially causative de novo two base indels in sqstm <dig> c.115_116delinsta and upf <dig> c.1576_1577delinsa, and de novo snvs in cacnb <dig> c.1289g > a, and spry <dig> c.508 t > a, of uncertain significance. we report results from a large secondary control study of  <dig> exomes probing the pathogenicity of the above genes. we analyzed structural variation by four different algorithms including de novo genome assembly. we confirmed a likely contributory 165 kb de novo heterozygous 1q <dig> microdeletion missed by clinical microarray. the de novo assembly resulted in unmasking hidden genome instability that was missed by standard re-alignment based algorithms. we also interrogated regulatory sequence variation for known and hypothesized id genes and present useful strategies for wgs data analyses for non-coding variation.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an extensive analysis of wgs in the context of id, providing genetic and structural insights into id and yielding diagnoses.
