BACKGROUND
the y-larva, a crustacean larval type first identified more than  <dig> years ago, has been found in marine plankton samples collected in the arctic, temperate and tropical regions of all oceans. the great species diversity found among y-larvae  indicates that the adult organism may play a significant ecological role. however, despite intense efforts, the adult y-organism has never been identified, and nothing is therefore known about its biology.


RESULTS
we have successfully and repeatedly induced metamorphosis of y-larvae into a novel, highly reduced juvenile stage by applying the crustacean molting hormone 20-he. the new stage is slug-like, unsegmented and lacks both limbs and almost all other traits normally characterizing arthropods, but it is capable of vigorous peristaltic motions.


CONCLUSIONS
from our observations on live and preserved material we conclude that adult facetotecta are endoparasitic in still to be identified marine hosts and with a juvenile stage that represents a remarkable convergence to that seen in parasitic barnacles . from the distribution and abundance of facetotectan y-larvae in the world's oceans we furthermore suggest that these parasites are widespread and could play an important role in the marine environment.
