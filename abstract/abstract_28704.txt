BACKGROUND
scavenger receptors  recognize endogenous molecules modified by pathological processes as well as components of diverse microorganisms. mice deficient for both sr-ai and ii are more susceptible to infections by a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens.


RESULTS
here we show that sr-a deficient mice and wild type mice are equally susceptible to malaria infection both during liver and blood stages. moreover, like wild type mice, sr-a deficient mice are able to mount a protective immune response against radiation attenuated sporozoites.


CONCLUSIONS
our results do not reveal a function of sr-a i and ii receptors in the plasmodium berghei anka infection, both in the development of cm and parasitemia control. moreover, these receptors appear not to be required for the establishment of a protective immune response against the malaria liver stages.
