BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are an ancient group of photoautotrophic prokaryotes with wide variations in genome size and ecological habitat. metacaspases  are cysteine proteinases that have sequence homology to caspases and play essential roles in programmed cell death . mcas have been identified in several prokaryotes, fungi and plants; however, knowledge about cyanobacterial metacaspases still remains obscure. with the availability of sequenced genomes of  <dig> cyanobacteria, we perform a comparative analysis of metacaspases and explore their distribution, domain structure and evolution.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> putative mcas were identified, which are abundant in filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria and acaryochloris marina mbic  <dig> and absent in all prochlorococcus and marine synechococcus strains, except synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  the cys-his dyad of caspase superfamily is conserved, while mutations  are also detected in some cyanobacteria. mcas can be classified into two major families  based on the additional domain structure. ten types and a total of  <dig> additional domains were identified, most of which involves in signal transduction. apoptotic related nacht domain was also found in two cyanobacterial mcas. phylogenetic tree of mca catalytic p <dig> domains coincides well with the domain structure and the phylogenies based on 16s rrna.


CONCLUSIONS
the existence and quantity of mca genes in unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria are a function of the genome size and ecological habitat. mcas of family α and β seem to evolve separately and the recruitment of wd <dig> additional domain occurs later than the divergence of the two families. in this study, a general framework of sequence-structure-function connections for the metacaspases has been revealed, which may provide new targets for function investigation.
