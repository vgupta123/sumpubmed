BACKGROUND
environmental signals usually enhance secondary metabolite production in streptomycetes by initiating complex signal transduction system. it is known that different sigma factors respond to different types of stresses, respectively in streptomyces strains, which have a number of unique signal transduction mechanisms depending on the types of environmental shock. in this study, we wanted to know how a ph shock would affect the expression of various sigma factors and shock-related proteins in s. coelicolor a <dig> 


RESULTS
according to the results of transcriptional and proteomic analyses, the major number of sigma factor genes were upregulated by an acidic ph shock. well-studied sigma factor genes of sigh , sigr , sigb , and hrdd that play a major role in the secondary metabolism, were all strongly upregulated by the ph shock. a number of heat shock proteins including the dnak family and chaperones such as groel <dig> were also observed to be upregulated by the ph shock, while their repressor of hspr was strongly downregulated. oxidative stress-related proteins such as thioredoxin, catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and osmotic shock-related protein such as vesicle synthases were also upregulated in overall.


CONCLUSIONS
from these observations, an acidic ph shock was considered to be one of the strongest stresses to influence a wide range of sigma factors and shock-related proteins including general stress response proteins. the upregulation of the sigma factors and shock proteins already found to be related to actinorhodin biosynthesis was considered to have contributed to enhanced actinorhodin productivity by mediating the ph shock signal to regulators or biosynthesis genes for actinorhodin production.
