BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a family of ~ <dig> nucleotide small rna molecules that regulate gene expression by fully or partially binding to their complementary sequences. recently, a large number of mirnas and their expression patterns have been identified in various species. however, to date no mirnas have been reported to modulate muscle development in beef cattle.


RESULTS
total rnas from the chinese qinchuan bovine longissimus thoracis at fetal and adult stages were used to construct small rna libraries for solexa sbs technology sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from the fetal bovine library and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads from the adult bovine library. in total,  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> novel mirna candidates were identified. furthermore, the nucleotide bias, base edit and family of the known mirnas were also analyzed. based on stem-loop qpcr,  <dig> high-read mirnas were detected, and the results showed that bta-mirna- <dig>  mirna- <dig>  mirna- <dig>  mirnan <dig>  and mirnan <dig> were highly expressed in muscle-related tissue or organs, suggesting that these mirnas may play a role in the development of bovine muscle tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
this study confirmed the authenticity of  <dig> known mirnas, discovered  <dig> novel mirnas in bos taurus, and identified five muscle-specific mirnas. the identification of novel mirnas significantly expanded the repertoire of bovine mirnas and could contribute to further studies on the muscle development of cattle.
