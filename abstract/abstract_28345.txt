BACKGROUND
alterations of b cell subset distribution have been described in the peripheral blood  of rheumatoid arthritis  patients, but no data are available on differences between the onset and the established phases of the disease. the purpose of the study was to clarify whether a peculiar distribution of b cell subsets characterizes ra onset, thus leading to a more favorable clinical response to treatment, and to evaluate the possible association of a particular b cell subpopulation with response to therapy.


RESULTS
 <dig> ra patients were enrolled:  <dig> had symptom duration less than 3 months and were defined as having “very early ra” , and  <dig> had symptom duration from more than 3 months up to one year . the other  <dig> ra patients had long-standing ra . at baseline and at 6-month follow-up visit peripheral blood samples were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry for the distribution of circulating b cell subsets by staining with surface markers cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and igd and intracellular marker zap <dig> 

vera and era patients showed higher percentages and absolute counts of circulating antigen inexperienced naïve b cells  and lower percentages and absolute numbers of double negative  memory b cells and plasmablasts  compared to lsra patients. at the multivariate analysis, a higher frequency of naïve b cells  at baseline arose as significant predictor of cdai remission, together with “having vera disease” and a low disease activity at baseline.


CONCLUSIONS
the onset of ra is characterized by higher percentages and absolute numbers of naïve b cells and lower numbers of plasmablasts and double negative memory b cells compared to established ra. naïve b cells could represent a promising biomarker of outcome.
