BACKGROUND
for the last eight years, microarray-based classification has been a major topic in statistics, bioinformatics and biomedicine research. traditional methods often yield unsatisfactory results or may even be inapplicable in the so-called "p â‰« n" setting where the number of predictors p by far exceeds the number of observations n, hence the term "ill-posed-problem". careful model selection and evaluation satisfying accepted good-practice standards is a very complex task for statisticians without experience in this area or for scientists with limited statistical background. the multiplicity of available methods for class prediction based on high-dimensional data is an additional practical challenge for inexperienced researchers.


RESULTS
in this article, we introduce a new bioconductor package called cma  for automatically performing variable selection, parameter tuning, classifier construction, and unbiased evaluation of the constructed classifiers using a large number of usual methods. without much time and effort, users are provided with an overview of the unbiased accuracy of most top-performing classifiers. furthermore, the standardized evaluation framework underlying cma can also be beneficial in statistical research for comparison purposes, for instance if a new classifier has to be compared to existing approaches.


CONCLUSIONS
cma is a user-friendly comprehensive package for classifier construction and evaluation implementing most usual approaches. it is freely available from the bioconductor website at .
