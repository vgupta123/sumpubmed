BACKGROUND
amino acid-derived aldoximes and nitriles play important roles in plant defence. they are well-known as precursors for constitutive defence compounds such as cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates, but are also released as volatiles after insect feeding. cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  of the cyp <dig> family catalyze the formation of aldoximes from the corresponding amino acids. however, the majority of cyp79s characterized so far are involved in cyanogenic glucoside or glucosinolate biosynthesis and only a few have been reported to be responsible for nitrogenous volatile production.


RESULTS
in this study we analysed and compared the jasmonic acid-induced volatile blends of two erythroxylum species, the cultivated south american crop species e. coca and the african wild species e. fischeri. both species produced different nitrogenous compounds including aliphatic aldoximes and an aromatic nitrile. four isolated cyp <dig> genes  were heterologously expressed in yeast and biochemically characterized. cyp79d <dig> from e. coca and cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> from e. fischeri showed broad substrate specificity in vitro and converted l-phenylalanine, l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-tryptophan, and l-tyrosine into the respective aldoximes. in contrast, recombinant cyp79d <dig> from e. coca exclusively accepted l-tryptophan as substrate. quantitative real-time pcr revealed that cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig> were significantly upregulated in jasmonic acid-treated erythroxylum leaves.


CONCLUSIONS
the kinetic parameters of the enzymes expressed in vitro coupled with the expression patterns of the corresponding genes and the accumulation and emission of -phenylacetaldoxime, -indole-3-acetaldoxime, -3-methylbutyraldoxime, and -2-methylbutyraldoxime in jasmonic acid-treated leaves suggest that cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig> accept l-phenylalanine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-tryptophan as substrates in vivo and contribute to the production of volatile and semi-volatile nitrogenous defence compounds in e. coca and e. fischeri.
