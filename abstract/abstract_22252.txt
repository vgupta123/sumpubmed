BACKGROUND
housekeeping  genes are ubiquitously expressed in all tissue/cell types and constitute a basal transcriptome for the maintenance of basic cellular functions. partitioning transcriptomes into hk and tissue-specific  genes relatively is fundamental for studying gene expression and cellular differentiation. although many studies have aimed at large-scale and thorough categorization of human hk genes, a meaningful consensus has yet to be reached.


RESULTS
we collected two latest gene expression datasets  from public databases and analyzed the gene expression profiles in  <dig> human tissues that have been well-documented by both two data types. benchmarked by a manually-curated hk gene collection , we demonstrated that present data from est sampling was far from saturated, and the inadequacy has limited the gene detectability and our understanding of ts expressions. due to a likely over-stringent threshold, microarray data showed higher false negative rate compared with est data, leading to a significant underestimation of hk genes. based on est data, we found that  <dig> % of the currently annotated human genes were universally expressed in at least  <dig> of  <dig> tissues, as compared to only  <dig> % specifically expressed in a single tissue. our current est-based estimate on human hk genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in number, a ten-fold increase in comparison with previous microarray-based estimates.


CONCLUSIONS
we concluded that a significant fraction of human genes, at least in the currently annotated data depositories, was broadly expressed. our understanding of tissue-specific expression was still preliminary and required much more large-scale and high-quality transcriptomic data in future studies. the new hk gene list categorized in this study will be useful for genome-wide analyses on structural and functional features of hk genes.
