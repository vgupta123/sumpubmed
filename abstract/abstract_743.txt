BACKGROUND
xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight disease, is a serious pathogen of rice. here we describe a fluorescent marker system to study virulence and pathogenicity of x. oryzae pv. oryzae.


RESULTS
a fluorescent x. oryzae pv. oryzae philippine race  <dig> strain expressing green fluorescent protein   was generated using the gfp gene under the control of the neomycin promoter in the vector, ppneo-gfp. the pxo99gfpstrain displayed identical virulence and avirulence properties as the wild type control strain, pxo <dig>  using fluorescent microscopy, bacterial multiplication and colonization were directly observed in rice xylem vessels. accurate and rapid determination of bacterial growth was assessed using fluoremetry and an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay .


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the fluorescent marker system is useful for assessing bacterial infection and monitoring bacterial multiplication in planta.
