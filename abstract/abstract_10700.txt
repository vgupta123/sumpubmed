BACKGROUND
ecdysone triggers transcriptional changes via the ecdysone receptor  to coordinate developmental programs of apoptosis, cell cycle and differentiation. data suggests ecr affects cell cycle gene expression indirectly and here we identify wingless as an intermediary factor linking ecr to cell cycle.


RESULTS
we demonstrate ecr patterns cell cycle across the presumptive drosophila wing margin by constraining wg transcription to modulate cycb expression, but not the previously identified wg-targets dmyc or stg. furthermore co-knockdown of wg restores cycb patterning in ecr knockdown clones. wg is not a direct target of ecr, rather we demonstrate that repression of wg by ecr is likely mediated by direct interaction between the ecr-responsive zinc finger transcription factor crol and the wg promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
thus we elucidate a critical mechanism potentially connecting ecdysone with patterning signals to ensure correct timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation during margin wing development.
