BACKGROUND
since drought can seriously affect plant growth and development and little is known about how the oscillations of gene expression during the drought stress-acclimation response in soybean is affected, we applied illumina technology to sequence  <dig> cdna libraries synthesized from control and drought-stressed soybean plants to verify the dynamic changes in gene expression during a 24-h time course. cycling variables were measured from the expression data to determine the putative circadian rhythm regulation of gene expression.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed in soybean plants in response to water deficit. of these genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed during the light period, from which approximately  <dig>  % were observed in both light and darkness. we found  <dig> genes that were either up- or down-regulated in different periods of the day. of  <dig>  predicted soybean genes,  <dig>  % exhibited expression oscillations in a 24 h period. this number increased to  <dig>  % when plants were submitted to water deficit. major differences in gene expression were observed in the control plants from late day  until predawn  periods, indicating that gene expression oscillates during the course of 24 h in normal development. under water deficit, dissimilarity increased in all time-periods, indicating that the applied stress influenced gene expression. such differences in plants under stress were primarily observed in zt <dig>  to zt <dig>  and also from zt <dig> to zt <dig>  stress-related pathways were triggered in response to water deficit primarily during midday, when more genes were up-regulated compared to early morning. additionally, genes known to be involved in secondary metabolism and hormone signaling were also expressed in the dark period.


CONCLUSIONS
gene expression networks can be dynamically shaped to acclimate plant metabolism under environmental stressful conditions. we have identified putative cycling genes that are expressed in soybean leaves under normal developmental conditions and genes whose expression oscillates under conditions of water deficit. these results suggest that time of day, as well as light and temperature oscillations that occur considerably affect the regulation of water deficit stress response in soybean plants.
