BACKGROUND
chronic infections have been demonstrated to maintain low-grade systemic inflammation and associate with atherosclerosis. we studied the inflammation- and lipid homeostasis-related effects of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  and chlamydia pneumoniae  infections on the epididymal and inguinal adipose tissue  transcriptomes and fatty acid distribution in apolipoprotein  e-deficient mice. chow-fed apoe-deficient mice were exposed to 1) chronic intranasal infection with c. pneumoniae , 2) recurrent intravenous infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans , 3) a combination of both types of infection , or 4) infection with the vehicle . epididymal and inguinal at gene expression was analyzed using an illumina mouse wg- <dig> v <dig>  platform and quantitative pcr . microarray data were analyzed using gene ontology enrichment analysis. at fatty acid analysis was performed using gas–liquid chromatography.


RESULTS
the transcriptomics data revealed significant enrichment in inflammation-associated biological pathways in both at depots derived from the aa and cpn + aa treated mice compared with the control group. the proportion of saturated fatty acids was higher in the inguinal at in aa  and cpn + aa  groups and in the epididymal at in aa group . the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly lower among all aa-infected groups in both depots. chronic cpn infection displayed only minor effects on transcriptomics and fatty acids of the at depots.


CONCLUSIONS
systemic infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans activates inflammation-related biological pathways and modulates cellular lipid homeostasis. the adverse changes in adipose tissues during chronic infection may promote atherosclerosis.
