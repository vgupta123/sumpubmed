BACKGROUND
chromosomal translocations are a hallmark of cancer cells and give rise to fusion oncogenes. to gain insight into the mechanisms governing tumorigenesis, adequate model cell lines are required.


RESULTS
we employ the versatile crispr/cas system to engineer cell lines in which chromosomal translocations are either generated de novo  or existing translocations are reverted back to the original configuration . to this end, we co-apply two guide rnas to artificially generate two breakpoints and screen for spontaneous fusion events by pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
the approach we use is efficient and delivers clones bearing translocationsin a predictable fashion. detailed analysis suggests that the clones display no additional undesired alterations, implying that the approach is robust and precise.
