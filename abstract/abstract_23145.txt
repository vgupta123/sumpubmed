BACKGROUND
the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis by secreting arginine vasopressin  and oxytocin  in response to a variety of signals, including osmotic and nonosmotic stimuli. it is well established that central cholinergic mechanisms are critical in the regulation of cardiovascular responses and maintenance of body fluid homeostasis in adults. our recent study demonstrated that intracerebroventricular  injection of carbachol elicited an increase of blood pressure in the near-term ovine fetuses. however, in utero development of brain cholinergic mechanisms in the regulation of the hypothalamic neuropeptides is largely unknown. this study investigated avp and ot neural activation in the fetal hypothalamus induced by central carbachol.


RESULTS
chronically prepared near-term ovine fetuses  received an i.c.v. carbachol . fetal blood samples were collected for avp and ot assay, and brains were used for c-fos mapping studies. i.c.v. carbachol significantly increased fetal plasma avp and ot concentrations. intense fos immunoreactivity  was observed in the fetal supraoptic nuclei  and paraventricular nuclei  in the hypothalamus. double labeling demonstrated that a number of avp- and ot-containing neurons in the fetal son and pvn were expressing c-fos in response to central carbachol.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that the central cholinergic mechanism is established and functional in the regulation of the hypothalamic neuropeptides during the final trimester of pregnancy. this provides evidence for a functional link between the development of central cholinergic mechanisms and hypothalamic neuropeptide systems in the fetus.
