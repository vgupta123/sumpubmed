BACKGROUND
pregnancy-associated glycoproteins  were first described as placental antigens present in the blood serum of the mother soon after implantation. here, we describe the purification of several pregnancy-associated glycoproteins from water buffalo placenta . a specific radioimmunoassay  was developed for early pregnancy diagnosis in buffalo species.


RESULTS
amino-terminal microsequencing of immunoreactive placental proteins allowed the identification of eleven wbpags sequences . three polyclonal antisera  were raised in rabbits against distinct wbpag fractions. a new ria  was developed and used to distinguish between pregnant  and non-pregnant  water buffalo females.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirmed the multiplicity of pag expression in buffalo placenta. in addition, the ria- <dig> system was shown to be sensitive, linear, reproducible, accurate and specific in measuring pag concentrations in buffalo plasma samples from day  <dig> of gestation onwards.
