BACKGROUND
scleractinian corals and their algal endosymbionts  exhibit distinct bathymetric distributions on coral reefs. yet, few studies have assessed the evolutionary context of these ecological distributions by exploring the genetic diversity of closely related coral species and their associated symbiodinium over large depth ranges. here we assess the distribution and genetic diversity of five agariciid coral species  and their algal endosymbionts  across a large depth gradient  covering shallow to mesophotic depths on a caribbean reef.


RESULTS
the five agariciid species exhibited distinct depth distributions, and dominant symbiodinium associations were found to be species-specific, with each of the agariciid species harbouring a distinct its2-dgge profile . only a. lamarcki harboured different symbiodinium types across its depth distribution . phylogenetic analysis  of the coral hosts demonstrated a division of the agaricia genus into two major lineages that correspond to their bathymetric distribution , highlighting the role of depth-related factors in the diversification of these congeneric agariciid species. the divergence between “shallow” and “deep” host species was reflected in the relatedness of the associated symbiodinium , corroborating the notion that brooding corals and their symbiodinium are engaged in coevolutionary processes.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings support the hypothesis that the depth-related environmental gradient on reefs has played an important role in the diversification of the genus agaricia and their associated symbiodinium, resulting in a genetic segregation between coral host-symbiont communities at shallow and mesophotic depths.
