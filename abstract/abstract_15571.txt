BACKGROUND
molecular genetic studies of bombyx mori have led to profound advances in our understanding of the regulation of development. bombyx mori brain, as a main endocrine organ, plays important regulatory roles in various biological processes. microarray technology will allow the genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in silkworm brains.


RESULTS
we reported microarray-based gene expression profiles in silkworm brains at four stages including v <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  a total of  <dig>  genes were transcribed in at least one selected stage. of these, clustering algorithms separated the expressed genes into stably expressed genes and variably expressed genes. the results of the gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis of stably expressed genes showed that the ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were principal pathways. secondly, four clusters of genes with significantly different expression patterns were observed in the  <dig>  variably expressed genes. thirdly, thirty-two neuropeptide genes, six neuropeptide-like precursor genes, and  <dig> cuticular protein genes were expressed in selected developmental stages.


CONCLUSIONS
major characteristics of the transcriptional profiles in the brains of bombyx mori at specific development stages were present in this study. our data provided useful information for future research.
