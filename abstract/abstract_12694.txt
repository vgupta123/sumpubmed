BACKGROUND
the thymic epithelium is the major microenvironmental component of the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ responsible for the generation of t lymphocytes. thymic epithelial cells  control intrathymic t cell differentiation by means of distinct types of interactions. tec constitutively produce chemokines and extracellular matrix ligands  and express corresponding receptors, which allow thymocytes to migrate in a very ordered fashion. we previously showed that laminin mediates tec/thymocyte interactions in both mice and humans. more recently, we used rnai technology to knock-down the itga <dig> gene  in cultured human tec. using a similar strategy, herein we knocked-down the itga <dig> gene, which encodes cd49f, the α-chain of two integrin-type laminin receptors, namely vla- <dig>  and α6β <dig> 


RESULTS
we first confirmed that rnai-induced knock-down of the itga <dig> gene was successful, at both transcription and translational levels, with a significant decrease in the membrane expression of cd49f, apart from cd49b, cd49c and cd49d, ascertained by cytofluorometry on living tec. we also demonstrated that such knock-down promotes a decrease in cell adhesion to laminin. using quantitative pcr, we demonstrated that gene expression of other integrin α-chains were concomitantly down-regulated, particularly those which form other laminin receptors, including itga <dig>  itga <dig> and itga <dig>  interestingly enough, lama <dig> gene expression  was largely increased in itga <dig> knocked-down tec cultures. lastly, the network complexity of gene expression under itga <dig> influence is much broader, since we found that other cell migration-related genes, namely those coding for various chemokines, are also modulated when igta <dig> is knocked-down.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented herein clearly show that down regulation of itga <dig> gene in the human thymic epithelium triggers a complex cascade of effects upon the expression levels of several other cell migration-related genes, including extracellular matrix and chemokine ligands and receptors. taken together, these data unravel the concept that the expression of genes involved in controlling of thymocyte migration by the thymic microenvironment should be regarded as complex networks, so that a defect in the expression of one single gene may reflect in an amplified cascade with functional consequences for tec adhesion onto the natural ligand and potential consequences upon the normal patterns of tec/thymocyte interactions.
