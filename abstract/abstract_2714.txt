BACKGROUND
cowpea  is an important crop in arid and semi-arid regions and is a good model for studying drought tolerance. micrornas  are known to play critical roles in plant stress responses, but drought-associated mirnas have not been identified in cowpea. in addition, it is not understood how mirnas might contribute to different capacities of drought tolerance in different cowpea genotypes.


RESULTS
we generated deep sequencing small rna reads from two cowpea genotypes  that grew under well-watered and drought stress conditions. we mapped small rna reads to cowpea genomic sequences and identified  <dig> mirna genes that belong to  <dig> families. among  <dig> drought-associated mirnas,  <dig> were upregulated in drought condition and  <dig> were downregulated. although mirna expression was in general consistent in two genotypes, we found that nine mirnas were predominantly or exclusively expressed in one of the two genotypes and that  <dig> mirnas were drought-regulated in only one genotype, but not the other.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that mirnas may play important roles in drought tolerance in cowpea and may be a key factor in determining the level of drought tolerance in different cowpea genotypes.
