BACKGROUND
altered hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal  axis activity may be accompanied by a modulation of pain sensitivity. in a model of neuropathic pain  we investigated the onset and maintenance of mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia and the expression of biochemical mediators potentially involved in spinal cell modulation in two rat strains displaying either hypo-  or hyper-  reactivity of the hpa axis.


RESULTS
mechanical pain thresholds and plasmatic corticosterone levels were assessed before and during periods of  <dig> or 21 days following cci surgery. at the end of the respective protocols, the mrna expression of glial cell markers  and glutamate transporters  were examined. we observed a correlation between the hpa axis reactivity and the pain behavior but not as commonly described in the literature; lew rats seemed to be less sensitive than fis from  <dig> to 14 days after the cci surgery when looking at the mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia. however, the biochemical spinal markers expression we observed is conflicting.


CONCLUSIONS
we did not find a specific causal relation between the pain behavior and the glial cell activation or the expression of the glutamate transporters, suggesting that the interaction between the hpa axis and the spinal activation pattern is more complex in a context of neuropathic pain.
