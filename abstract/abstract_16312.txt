BACKGROUND
ankyrin repeats and lem domain containing protein  <dig>  belongs to the lem protein family, whose members share a chromatin-interacting lem motif. unlike most other lem proteins, ankle <dig> is not an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane but shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. it contains a giy-yig-type nuclease domain, but its function is unknown. the mammalian genome encodes only one other giy-yig domain protein, termed slx <dig>  slx <dig> has been described as a resolvase that processes holliday junctions during homologous recombination-mediated dna double strand break repair. resolvase activity is regulated in a spatial and temporal manner during the cell cycle. we hypothesized that ankle <dig> may have a similar function and its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling may contribute to the regulation of ankle <dig> activity. hence, we aimed at identifying the domains mediating ankle <dig> shuttling and investigating whether cellular localization is affected during dna damage response.


RESULTS
sequence analysis predicts the presence of two canonical nuclear import and export signals in ankle <dig>  immunofluorescence microscopy of cells expressing wild-type and various mutated ankle1-fusion proteins revealed a c-terminally located classical monopartite nuclear localization signal and a centrally located crm1-dependent nuclear export signal that mediate nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of ankle <dig>  these sequences are also functional in heterologous proteins. the predominant localization of ankle <dig> in the cytoplasm, however, does not change upon induction of several dna damage response pathways throughout the cell cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified the domains mediating nuclear import and export of ankle <dig>  ankle1’s cellular localization was not affected following dna damage.
