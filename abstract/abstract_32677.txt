BACKGROUND
the orthologs of eukaryotic initiation factor 5c  are essential to the initiation of protein translation, and their regulation during development is not well known.


RESULTS
a cdna encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids containing an n-terminal leucine zipper motif and a c-terminal eif5c domain was cloned from metamorphic larvae of helicoverpa armigera. it was subsequently named ha-eif5c. quantitative real-time pcr  revealed a high expression of the mrna of ha-eif5c in the head-thorax, integument, midgut, and fat body during metamorphosis. immunohistochemistry suggested that ha-eif5c was distributed into both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the midgut, fat body and integument. ha-eif5c expression was upregulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone . furthermore, the transcription of ha-eif5c was down regulated after silencing of ecdysteroid receptor  or ultraspiracle protein  by rnai.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that during metamorphosis of the cotton bollworm, ha-eif5c was upregulated by 20e through the ecr and usp transcription factors.
