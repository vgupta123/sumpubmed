BACKGROUND
the kruskal-wallis test is a popular non-parametric statistical test for identifying expression quantitative trait loci  from genome-wide data due to its robustness against variations in the underlying genetic model and expression trait distribution, but testing billions of marker-trait combinations one-by-one can become computationally prohibitive.


RESULTS
we developed krux, an algorithm implemented in matlab, python and r that uses matrix multiplications to simultaneously calculate the kruskal-wallis test statistic for several millions of marker-trait combinations at once. krux is more than ten thousand times faster than computing associations one-by-one on a typical human dataset. we used krux and a dataset of more than 500k snps and 20k expression traits measured in  <dig> human blood samples to compare eqtls detected by the kruskal-wallis test to eqtls detected by the parametric anova and linear model methods. we found that the kruskal-wallis test is more robust against data outliers and heterogeneous genotype group sizes and detects a higher proportion of non-linear associations, but is more conservative for calling additive linear associations.


CONCLUSIONS
krux enables the use of robust non-parametric methods for massive eqtl mapping without the need for a high-performance computing infrastructure and is freely available from
