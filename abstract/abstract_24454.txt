BACKGROUND
we have surveyed, compiled and annotated nucleotide variations in  <dig> human 7-transmembrane receptors . in a sample of  <dig> chromosomes from a nordic population, we attempted to determine the allele frequencies of  <dig> non-synonymous snps, and found  <dig> novel polymorphic markers. gpcr receptors of physiological and clinical importance were prioritized for statistical analysis. natural variation and rare mutation information were merged and presented online in the human gpcr-db database .


RESULTS
the average number of snps per  <dig> bases of exonic sequence was found to be twice the average number of snps per kilobase of intronic regions . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were single exon genes, that is, were intronless. the average number of exonic-snps per single-exon gene was  <dig>   while that for multi-exon genes was  <dig>  . the average number of variations within the different protein domain  indicates a lower rate of variation in the trans-membrane region of monoamine gpcrs, as compared to chemokine- and peptide-receptor sub-classes of gpcrs.


CONCLUSIONS
single-exon gpcrs on average have approximately three times the number of snps as compared to gpcrs with introns. among various functional classes of gpcrs, monoamine gprcs have lower number of natural variations within the trans-membrane domain indicating evolutionary selection against non-synonymous changes within the membrane-localizing domain of this sub-class of gpcrs.
