BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a group of short  non-coding rnas that play important regulatory roles. mirna precursors  are characterized by their hairpin structures. however, a large amount of similar hairpins can be folded in many genomes. almost all current methods for computational prediction of mirnas use comparative genomic approaches to identify putative pre-mirnas from candidate hairpins. ab initio method for distinguishing pre-mirnas from sequence segments with pre-mirna-like hairpin structures is lacking. being able to classify real vs. pseudo pre-mirnas is important both for understanding of the nature of mirnas and for developing ab initio prediction methods that can discovery new mirnas without known homology.


RESULTS
a set of novel features of local contiguous structure-sequence information is proposed for distinguishing the hairpins of real pre-mirnas and pseudo pre-mirnas. support vector machine  is applied on these features to classify real vs. pseudo pre-mirnas, achieving about 90% accuracy on human data. remarkably, the svm classifier built on human data can correctly identify up to 90% of the pre-mirnas from other species, including plants and virus, without utilizing any comparative genomics information.


CONCLUSIONS
the local structure-sequence features reflect discriminative and conserved characteristics of mirnas, and the successful ab initio classification of real and pseudo pre-mirnas opens a new approach for discovering new mirnas.
