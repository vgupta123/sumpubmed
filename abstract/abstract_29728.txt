BACKGROUND
alternative promoters usage is an important paradigm in transcriptional control of mammalian gene expression. however, despite the growing interest in alternative promoters and their role in genome diversification, very little is known about how and on what occasions those promoters are differentially regulated. runx <dig> transcription factor is a key regulator of early hematopoiesis and a frequent target of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias. mice deficient in runx <dig> lack definitive hematopoiesis and die in mid-gestation. expression of runx <dig> is regulated by two functionally distinct promoters designated p <dig> and p <dig>  differential usage of these two promoters creates diversity in distribution and protein-coding potential of the mrna transcripts. while the alternative usage of p <dig> and p <dig> likely plays an important role in runx <dig> biology, very little is known about the function of the p1/p <dig> switch in mediating tissue and stage specific expression of runx <dig> during development.


RESULTS
we employed mice bearing a hypomorphic runx <dig> allele, with a largely diminished p <dig> activity, to investigate the biological role of alternative p1/p <dig> usage. mice homozygous for the hypomorphic allele developed to term, but died within a few days after birth. during embryogenesis the p1/p <dig> activity is spatially and temporally modulated. p <dig> activity is required in early hematopoiesis and when attenuated, development of liver hematopoietic progenitor cells  was impaired. early thymus development and thymopoiesis were also abrogated as reflected by thymic hypocellularity and loss of corticomedullary demarcation. differentiation of cd4/cd <dig> thymocytes was impaired and their apoptosis was enhanced due to altered expression of t-cell receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
the data delineate the activity of p <dig> and p <dig> in embryogenesis and describe previously unknown functions of runx <dig>  the findings show unequivocally that the role of p1/p <dig> during development is non redundant and underscore the significance of alternative promoter usage in runx <dig> biology.
