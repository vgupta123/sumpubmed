BACKGROUND
epistasis is recognized as a fundamental part of the genetic architecture of individuals. several computational approaches have been developed to model gene-gene interactions in case-control studies, however, none of them is suitable for time-dependent analysis. herein we introduce the survival dimensionality reduction  algorithm, a non-parametric method specifically designed to detect epistasis in lifetime datasets.


RESULTS
the algorithm requires neither specification about the underlying survival distribution nor about the underlying interaction model and proved satisfactorily powerful to detect a set of causative genes in synthetic epistatic lifetime datasets with a limited number of samples and high degree of right-censorship . the sdr method was then applied to a series of  <dig> dutch patients with active rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with anti-tnf biological agents. among a set of  <dig> candidate genes, none of which showed a detectable marginal effect on anti-tnf responses, the sdr algorithm did find that the rs <dig> snp in the fcÎ³riia gene and the rs <dig> snp in the irf <dig> gene non-linearly interact to predict clinical remission after anti-tnf biologicals.


CONCLUSIONS
simulation studies and application in a real-world setting support the capability of the sdr algorithm to model epistatic interactions in candidate-genes studies in presence of right-censored data.
