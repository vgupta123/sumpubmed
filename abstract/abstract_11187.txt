BACKGROUND
the development and outcome of cerebral malaria  reflects a complex interplay between parasite-expressed virulence factors and host response to infection. the murine cm model, plasmodium berghei anka , which simulates many of the features of human cm, provides an excellent system to study this host/parasite interface. we designed "combination" microarrays that concurrently detect genome-wide transcripts of both pba and mouse, and examined parasite and host transcriptional programs during infection of cm-susceptible  and cm-resistant  mice.


RESULTS
analysis of expression data from brain, lung, liver, and spleen of pba infected mice showed that both host and parasite gene expression can be examined using a single microarray, and parasite transcripts can be detected within whole organs at a time when peripheral blood parasitemia is low. parasites display a unique transcriptional signature in each tissue, and lung appears to be a large reservoir for metabolically active parasites. in comparisons of susceptible versus resistant animals, both host and parasite display distinct, organ-specific transcriptional profiles. differentially expressed mouse genes were related to humoral immune response, complement activation, or cell-cell interactions. pba displayed differential expression of genes related to biosynthetic activities.


CONCLUSIONS
these data show that host and parasite gene expression profiles can be simultaneously analysed using a single "combination" microarray, and that both the mouse and malaria parasite display distinct tissue- and strain-specific responses during infection. this technology facilitates the dissection of host-pathogen interactions in experimental cerebral malaria and could be extended to other disease models.
