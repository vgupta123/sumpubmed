BACKGROUND
the rd <dig> mouse retina is a well-studied model of retinal degeneration where rod photoreceptors undergo cell death beginning at postnatal day   <dig> until p <dig>  this period coincides with photoreceptor terminal differentiation in a normal retina. we have used the rd <dig> retina as a model to investigate early molecular defects in developing rod photoreceptors prior to the onset of degeneration.


RESULTS
using a microarray approach, we performed gene profiling comparing rd <dig> and wild type  retinas at four time points starting at p <dig>  prior to any obvious biochemical or morphological differences, and concluding at p <dig>  prior to the initiation of cell death. of the  <dig> identified differentially expressed genes, we focused on rab acceptor  <dig> , which codes for the protein prenylated rab acceptor  <dig>  and plays an important role in vesicular trafficking. quantitative rt-pcr analysis confirmed reduced expression of pra <dig> in rd <dig> retina at all time points examined. immunohistochemical observation showed that pra1-like immunoreactivity  co-localized with the cis-golgi marker gm- <dig> in the photoreceptor as the golgi translocated from the perikarya to the inner segment during photoreceptor differentiation in wt retinas. diffuse pra1-lir, distinct from the golgi marker, was seen in the distal inner segment of wt photoreceptors starting at p <dig>  both plexiform layers contained pra <dig> positive punctae independent of gm- <dig> staining during postnatal development. in the inner retina, pra1-lir also colocalized with the golgi marker in the perinuclear region of most cells. a similar pattern was seen in the rd <dig> mouse inner retina. however, punctate and significantly reduced pra1-lir was present throughout the developing rd <dig> inner segment, consistent with delayed photoreceptor development and abnormalities in golgi sorting and vesicular trafficking.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified genes that are differentially regulated in the rd <dig> retina at early time points, which may give insights into developmental defects that precede photoreceptor cell death. this is the first report of pra <dig> expression in the retina. our data support the hypothesis that pra <dig> plays an important role in vesicular trafficking between the golgi and cilia in differentiating and mature rod photoreceptors.
