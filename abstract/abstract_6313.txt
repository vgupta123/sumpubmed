BACKGROUND
the highly conserved macromolecular synthesis operon  contains both dnag  and siga . however, in previously evaluated gram-positive species, the mmso is divergent upstream of dnag. the mmso of bacillus subtilis contains three open reading frames  that are differentially regulated by multiple promoters. in conjunction with studies to determine the expression profile of dnag, the mmso of staphylococus epidermidis was characterized.


RESULTS
the orfs of s. epidermidis were compared to the previously described mmso of b. subtilis and two additional orfs in s. epidermidis, serp <dig> and serp <dig>  were identified. the largest transcript,  <dig>  kb in length, was expressed only in exponential growth and encompassed all four orfs . a separate transcript  comprising serp <dig> and serp <dig> was expressed in early exponential growth. two smaller transcripts  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in size were detected with a siga probe in both exponential and post-exponential phases of growth. western blot analysis correlated with the transcriptional profile and demonstrated that serp <dig> was detected only in the exponential phase of growth. computational analysis identified that serp <dig> contained a cbs motif whereas serp <dig> contained an atp/gtp binding motif. functional studies of serp <dig> demonstrated that it was capable of binding both atp and gtp. comparisons with a sigb:dhfr mutant revealed that the  <dig>  kb siga transcript was regulated by a σb-dependent promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies demonstrated that the s. epidermidis  <dig> mmso contains two orfs  not described within the b. subtilis mmso and at least three promoters, one of which is σβ-dependent. the transcriptional regulation of siga by σb provides evidence that the staphylococcal σb-dependent response is controlled at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. the conservation of serp <dig> across multiple gram-positive organisms and its capability to bind atp and gtp support the need for further investigation of its role in bacterial growth.
