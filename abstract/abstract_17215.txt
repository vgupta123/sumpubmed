BACKGROUND
although serotype o157:h <dig> is the predominant enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli , outbreaks of non-o <dig> ehec that cause severe foodborne illness, including hemolytic uremic syndrome have increased worldwide. in fact, non-o <dig> serotypes are now estimated to cause over half of all the shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  cases, and outbreaks of non-o <dig> ehec infections are frequently associated with serotypes o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  currently, there are no complete genomes for o <dig> in public databases.


RESULTS
we determined the complete genome sequences of two o <dig> strains , one linked to a us lettuce-associated outbreak  and one to a belgium ice-cream-associated outbreak . both strains contain one chromosome and two large plasmids, with genome sizes of  <dig> , <dig> bp for rm <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> bp for rm <dig>  comparative analysis of the two eco <dig> genomes revealed a large core  and a considerable amount of strain-specific genes. additionally, the two eco <dig> genomes display distinct chromosomal architecture, virulence gene profile, phylogenetic origin of stx2a prophage, and methylation profile . comparative analysis of eco <dig> genomes to other completely sequenced stec and other e. coli and shigella genomes revealed that, unlike any other known non-o <dig> ehec strain, eco <dig> ascended from a common lineage with eco157/eco <dig>  this evolutionary relationship was further supported by the pangenome analysis of the  <dig> ehec str ains. of the  <dig>  ehec core genes, eco <dig> shares more genes with eco <dig> than with the any other non-o <dig> ehec strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide evidence that eco <dig> and eco <dig> evolved from a common lineage, but ultimately each serotype evolves via a lineage-independent nature to ehec by acquisition of the core set of ehec virulence factors, including the genes encoding shiga toxin and the large virulence plasmid. the large variation between the two eco <dig> genomes suggests a distinctive evolutionary path between the two outbreak strains. the distinct methylome between the two eco <dig> strains is likely due to the presence of a bsubi/psti methyltransferase gene cassette in the stx2a prophage of the strain rm <dig>  suggesting a role of horizontal gene transfer-mediated epigenetic alteration in the evolution of individual ehec strains.
