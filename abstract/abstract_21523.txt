BACKGROUND
dna double-strand breaks  are induced by exogenous insults such as ionizing radiation and chemical exposure, and they can also arise as a consequence of stalled or collapsed dna replication forks. failure to repair dsbs can lead to genomic instability or cell death and cancer in higher eukaryotes. the schizosaccharomyces pombe fbh <dig> gene encodes an f-box dna helicase previously described to play a role in the rhp <dig> -dependent recombinational repair of dsbs. fbh <dig> fused to gfp localizes to discrete nuclear foci following dna damage.


RESULTS
to determine the functional roles of the highly conserved f-box and helicase domains, we have characterized fbh <dig> mutants carrying specific mutations in these domains. we show that the f-box mutation fbh1-fb disturbs the nuclear localization of fbh <dig>  conferring an fbh <dig> null-like phenotype. moreover, nuclear foci do not form in fbh1-fb cells with dna damage even if fbh1-fb is targeted to the nucleus by fusion to a nuclear localization signal sequence. in contrast, the helicase mutation fbh1-hl causes the accumulation of fbh <dig> foci irrespective of the presence of dna damage and confers damage sensitivity greater than that conferred by the null allele. additional mutation of the f-box alleviates the hypermorphic phenotype of the fbh1-hl mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the f-box and dna helicase domains play indispensable but distinct roles in fbh <dig> function. assembly of the scffbh <dig> complex is required for both the nuclear localization and dna damage-induced focus formation of fbh <dig> and is therefore prerequisite for the fbh <dig> recombination function.
