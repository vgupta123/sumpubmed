BACKGROUND
motif searching is an important step in the detection of rare events occurring in a set of dna or protein sequences. one formulation of the problem is known as -motif search or planted motif search . in pms we are given two integers l and d and n biological sequences. we want to find all sequences of length l that appear in each of the input sequences with at most d mismatches. the pms problem is np-complete. pms algorithms are typically evaluated on certain instances considered challenging. despite ample research in the area, a considerable performance gap exists because many state of the art algorithms have large runtimes even for moderately challenging instances.


RESULTS
this paper presents a fast exact parallel pms algorithm called pms <dig>  pms <dig> is the first algorithm to solve the challenging  instances  and . pms <dig> is also efficient on instances with larger l and d such as . we include a comparison of pms <dig> with several state of the art algorithms on multiple problem instances. this paper also presents necessary and sufficient conditions for  <dig> l-mers to have a common d-neighbor. the program is freely available at http://engr.uconn.edu/~man09004/pms8/.


CONCLUSIONS
we present pms <dig>  an efficient exact algorithm for planted motif search. pms <dig> introduces novel ideas for generating common neighborhoods. we have also implemented a parallel version for this algorithm. pms <dig> can solve instances not solved by any previous algorithms.
