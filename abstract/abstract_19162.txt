BACKGROUND
risk for infections from legionella pneumophila for immunocompromised individuals increases greatly when this species is present within the biofilm of the water distribution systems of hospitals or other health facilities. multiplication and persistence of legionella may dependent also upon planktonic growth in alternative to sessile growth. here we compared the persistence of l. pneumophila serogroup  <dig> in experimental planktonic co-cultures subsided with iron, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non legionella bacteria , isolated from drinking water sources of a large hospital.


RESULTS
concentrations of l. pneumophila showed a decreasing pattern with incubation time in all co-cultures, the degree of reduction depending on the experimental treatment. in co-cultures with added p. aeruginosa, no l. pneumophila was detectable already after 4 days of incubation. in contrast in co-cultures without p. aeruginosa, hpc but not iron were significant factors in explaining the pattern of l. pneumophila, although the hpc effect was different according to the incubation time .


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight the need of controlling for both hpc and metal constituents of the water systems of buildings used by individuals at particular risk to the effects of legionella exposure.
