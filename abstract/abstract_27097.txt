BACKGROUND
hypersecretion of cytokines and serine proteinases has been observed in asthma. since protease-activated receptors  are receptors of several serine proteinases and airway epithelial cells are a major source of cytokines, the influence of serine proteinases and pars on interleukin - <dig> secretion and gene expression in cultured a <dig> cells was examined.


RESULTS
a <dig> cells express all four pars at both protein and mrna levels as assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . thrombin, tryptase, elastase and trypsin induce a up to  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold increase in il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells, respectively following  <dig> h incubation period. the thrombin, elastase and trypsin induced secretion of il- <dig> can be abolished by their specific inhibitors. agonist peptides of par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> stimulate up to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold increase in il- <dig> secretion, respectively. real time pcr shows that il- <dig> mrna is up-regulated by the serine proteinases tested and by agonist peptides of par- <dig> and par- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the proteinases, possibly through activation of pars can stimulate il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells, suggesting that they are likely to contribute to il- <dig> related airway inflammatory disorders in man.
