BACKGROUND
an increasing number of genetic components are available in several depositories of such components to facilitate synthetic biology research, but picking out those that will allow a designed circuit to achieve the specified function still requires multiple cycles of testing. here, we addressed this problem by developing a computational pipeline to mathematically simulate a gene circuit for a comprehensive range and combination of the kinetic parameters of the biological components that constitute the gene circuit.


RESULTS
we showed that, using a well-studied transcriptional repression cascade as an example, the sets of kinetic parameters that could produce the specified system dynamics of the gene circuit formed clusters of recurrent combinations, referred to as kinetic motifs, which appear to be associated with both the specific topology and specified dynamics of the circuit. furthermore, the use of the resulting "handbook" of performance-ranked kinetic motifs in finding suitable circuit components was illustrated in two application scenarios.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that the computational pipeline developed here can provide a rational-based guide to aid in the design and improvement of synthetic gene circuits.
