BACKGROUND
intermuscular bones  and ribs both are a part of skeletal system in teleosts, but with different developing process. the chemical composition of fish ibs and ribs as well as the underlying mechanism about their development have not been investigated. in the present study, histological structures showed that one bone cavity containing osteoclasts were existed in ribs, but not in ibs of megalobrama amblycephala. we constructed the first proteomics map for fish bones including ibs and ribs, and identified the differentially expressed proteins between ibs and ribs through itraq lc-ms/ms proteomic analysis.


RESULTS
the proteins extracted from ibs and ribs at 1- to 2-year old m. amblycephala were quantified  <dig>  proteins, with  <dig>  proteins annotated with go annotation in biological processes, molecular function and cellular component. a number of bone related proteins as well as pathways were identified in the study. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differently expressed proteins were identified in comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib, which indicated the obvious differences of chemical composition between these two bone tissues. the two proteins  related to osteoclasts differentiation were significantly up-regulated in ribs compared with ibs , which was in accordance with the results from histological structures. in comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib,  <dig> and  <dig> differently expressed proteins were identified and the function annotation results showed that these proteins were involved in regulating bone development and differentiation. subsequently,  <dig> and  <dig> candidate proteins in comparison group of 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 1-ib-vs-2-ib related to bone development were validated by mrm assays.


CONCLUSIONS
our present study suggested the different key proteins involved in the composition of fish ribs and ibs as well as their growth development. these findings could provide important clues towards further understanding of fish skeletal system and the roles of proteins playing in regulating diverse biological processes in fish.
