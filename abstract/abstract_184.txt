BACKGROUND
corticosterone is one of the most crucial glucocorticoids  in poultry. our previous study shows that corticosterone can retard the longitudinal growth of bones by depressing the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in broilers. the present study was designed to investigate whether corticosterone affect the development of chondrocytes and the synthesis of collagen in vitro. the chondrocytes were isolated from proximal tibial growth plates of 6-week-old broiler chickens and cultured with different doses of corticosterone for 48 h. then the cell viability, alkaline phosphatase  activity and the expression of parathyroid hormone-related peptide  and type x collagen  were detected.


RESULTS
at 10−9-10−6 m concentration, corticosterone significantly inhibited the viability and differentiation of chondrocytes, as indicated by decreases in alp and type x collagen expression. conversely, there was completely opposite effect at 10−10 m. in addition, the expression of pthrp was significantly downregulated at 10−6 m and 10−8 m, and was upregulated at 10−10 m.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that corticosterone regulated chicken chondrocytes performance depending on its concentration with high concentrations inhibiting the viability and differentiation of chondrocytes and light concentrations promoting them, and these roles of corticosterone may be in part mediated through pthrp.
