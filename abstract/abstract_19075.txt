BACKGROUND
virulent mycobacterium leprae interfere with host defense mechanisms such as cytokine activation and apoptosis. the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is regulated by the bcl- <dig> family of proteins. expression of fas ligand and apoptotic proteins is found in leprosy lesions and m. leprae has been shown to activate pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> genes, bak and bax. however, the mechanism by which m. leprae modulates apoptosis is as yet unclear. we investigated expression of apoptotic genes in thp- <dig> monocytes in response to infection by m. leprae and non-pathogenic m. bovis bcg.


RESULTS
m. leprae did not induce apoptosis in thp- <dig> cells, while bcg induced a significant loss of cell viability by  <dig> h post-infection at both  moi- <dig> and  <dig>  with an increase by  <dig> h. bcg-induced cell death was accompanied by characteristic apoptotic dna laddering in cells. non-viable bcg had a limited effect on host cell death suggesting that bcg-induced apoptosis was a function of mycobacterial viability. m. leprae also activated lower levels of tnf-alpha secretion and tnf-alpha mrna expression than bcg. mycobacterium-induced activation of apoptotic gene expression was determined over a time course of infection. m. leprae reduced bad and bak mrna expression by  <dig> h post-stimulation, with a further decrease at  <dig> h. outcome of cell viability is determined by the ratio between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins present in the cell. m. leprae infection resulted in downregulation of gene expression ratios, bad/bcl- <dig> mrna by 39% and bak/bcl- <dig> mrna by 23%. in contrast, live bcg increased bad/bcl- <dig> mrna  but had a negligible effect on bak/bcl- <dig> mrna. heat killed bcg induced only a negligible  change in mrna expression of either bak/bcl- <dig> or bad/bcl- <dig>  additionally, m. leprae upregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic gene mcl- <dig> while, bcg downregulated mcl- <dig> mrna.


CONCLUSIONS
this study proposes an association between mycobacterium-induced apoptosis in thp- <dig> cells and the regulation of bcl- <dig> family of proteins. m. leprae restricts apoptosis in thp- <dig> cells by downregulation of bad and bak and upregulation of mcl- <dig> mrna expression.
