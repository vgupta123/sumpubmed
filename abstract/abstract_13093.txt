BACKGROUND
clostridium botulinum is the taxonomic designation for at least six diverse species that produce botulinum neurotoxins . there are seven known serotypes of bonts , all of which are potent toxins classified as category a bioterrorism agents. bont/g is the least studied of the seven serotypes. in an effort to further characterize the holotoxin and neurotoxin-associated proteins , we conducted an in silico and proteomic analysis of commercial bont/g complex. we describe the relative quantification of the proteins present in the/g complex and confirm our ability to detect the toxin activity in vitro. in addition, we review previous literature to provide a complete description of the bont/g complex.


RESULTS
an in-depth comparison of protein sequences indicated that bont/g shares the most sequence similarity with the/b serotype. a temperature-modified endopep-ms activity assay was successful in the detection of bont/g activity. gel electrophoresis and in gel digestions, followed by ms/ms analysis of/g complex, revealed the presence of four proteins in the complexes: neurotoxin  and three naps--nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin  and two hemagglutinins . rapid high-temperature in-solution tryptic digestions, coupled with ms/ms analysis, generated higher than previously reported sequence coverages for all proteins associated with the complex: bont 66%, ntnh 57%, ha <dig> 91%, and ha <dig> 99%. label-free relative quantification determined that the complex contains 30% bont, 38% ntnh, 28% ha <dig>  and 4% ha <dig> by weight comparison and 17% bont, 23% ntnh, 42% ha <dig>  and 17% ha <dig> by molecular comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
the in silico protein sequence comparisons established that the/g complex is phenetically related to the other six serotypes of c. botulinum. proteomic analyses and endopep-ms confirmed the presence of bont and naps, along with the activity of the commercial/g complex. the use of data-independent mse data analysis, coupled to label-free quantification software, suggested that the weight ratio bont:naps is 1: <dig>  whereas the molar ratio of bont:ntnh:ha70:ha <dig> is 1:1:2: <dig>  within the bont/g progenitor toxin.
