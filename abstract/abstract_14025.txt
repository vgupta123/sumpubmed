BACKGROUND
the flic and fljb genes in salmonella code for the phase  <dig>  and phase  <dig>  flagellin respectively, the rfb cluster encodes the majority of enzymes for polysaccharide  antigen biosynthesis, together they determine the antigenic profile by which salmonella are identified. sequencing and characterisation of flic was performed in the development of a molecular serotyping technique.


RESULTS
flic sequencing of  <dig> strains revealed two groups; the g-complex included those exhibiting "g" or "m,t" antigenic factors, and the non-g strains which formed a second more diverse group. variation in flic was characterised and sero-specific motifs identified. furthermore, it was possible to identify differences in certain h antigens that are not detected by traditional serotyping. a rapid short sequencing assay was developed to target serotype-specific sequence motifs in flic. the assay was evaluated for identification of h <dig> antigens with a panel of  <dig> strains.


CONCLUSIONS
flic sequences were obtained for more than  <dig> strains comprising  <dig> different h <dig> alleles. unique pyrosequencing profiles corresponding to the h <dig> component of the serotype were generated reproducibly for the  <dig> alleles represented in the evaluation panel. short read sequence assays can now be used to identify flic alleles in approximately 97% of the  <dig> medically most important salmonella in england and wales. capability for high throughput testing and automation give these assays considerable advantages over traditional methods.
