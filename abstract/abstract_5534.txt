BACKGROUND
fusarium graminearum, one of the causal agents of fusarium head blight , leads to severe losses in grain yield and quality due to the production of mycotoxins which are harmful to human and livestock. different traits for fhb resistance in wheat were identified for common wheat  while the sources of fhb resistance in durum wheat , one of the cereals most susceptible to f. graminearum infection, have not been found. new lines of evidence indicate that content and composition of cell wall polymers affect the susceptibility of the wall to degrading enzymes produced by pathogens during infection and can play a role in the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. the objective of our research is to identify potential cell wall biochemical traits linked to fusariosis resistance to be transferred from a resistant common wheat to a susceptible durum wheat line.


RESULTS
a detailed analysis of cell wall composition in spikes isolated from a highly resistant common wheat accession “02-5b-318”, a breeding line derived from the fhb-resistant chinese cv. sumai- <dig> and a high susceptible durum wheat cv. saragolla was performed. significant differences in lignin monolignols composition, arabinoxylan  substitutions and pectin methylesterification were found between resistant and susceptible plants. we isolated and characterized a pectin methylesterase gene wheatpme <dig>  which we found being down regulated in the fhb-resistant line and induced by fungal infection in the susceptible wheat.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate cell wall traits differing between the fhb sensitive and resistant wheat genotypes, possibly related to fhb-resistance, and identify the line 02-5b-318r as a potential resource of such traits. evidence suggests that wheatpme <dig> is involved in wheat response to f. graminearum.
