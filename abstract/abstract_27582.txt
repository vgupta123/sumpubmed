BACKGROUND
boar taint is observed in a high proportion of uncastrated male pigs and is characterized by an unpleasant odor/flavor in cooked meat, primarily caused by elevated levels of androstenone and skatole. androstenone is a steroid produced in the testis in parallel with biosynthesis of other sex steroids like testosterone and estrogens. this represents a challenge when performing selection against androstenone in breeding programs, without simultaneously decreasing levels of other steroids. the aim of this study was to use high-density genome wide association  in combination with linkage disequilibrium-linkage analysis  to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with boar taint compounds and related sex steroids in commercial landrace  and duroc  breeds.


RESULTS
altogether,  <dig> genome wide significant  qtl regions for androstenone in subcutaneous fat were obtained from the ldla study in landrace and  <dig> gws qtl regions in duroc. ldla analysis revealed that  <dig> of these qtl regions, located on ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were obtained in both breeds. all  <dig> gws androstenone qtls in landrace are also affecting the estrogens at chromosome wise significance  or gws levels, while in duroc,  <dig> of the  <dig> qtls affect androstenone without affecting any of the estrogens. for skatole,  <dig> and  <dig> qtls were gws in the ldla analysis for landrace and duroc respectively, with  <dig> of these detected in both breeds. the gws qtls for skatole obtained by ldla are located at ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report applying the porcine  <dig> k snp array for simultaneous analysis of boar taint compounds and related sex hormones, using both gwa and ldla approaches. several qtls are involved in regulation of androstenone and skatole, and most of the qtls for androstenone are also affecting the levels of estrogens. seven qtls for androstenone were detected in one breed and confirmed in the other, i.e. in an independent sample, although the majority of qtls are breed specific. most qtls for skatole do not negatively affect other sex hormones and should be easier to implement into the breeding scheme.
