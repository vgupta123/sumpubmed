BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a novel class of gene expression regulators implicated in cancer biology. neuroblastoma  is an embryonal tumour consisting of neural crest-derived undifferentiated cells and is characterised by variable clinical courses ranging from spontaneous regression to therapy-resistant progression. recent advances identified a subset of mirnas with putative function in nb biology. however, the full repertoire of mirnas expressed in nbs is not available.


RESULTS
we describe mirna profiles of  <dig> nb specimens and  <dig> nb cell lines as determined by mirna cloning. a total of  <dig> sequences were sequenced and analysed by a mirna prediction tool . our library covered 27% mirnas known to date.  <dig> reads corresponding to  <dig> individual sequences were classified as novel mirnas, including mirna* species of  <dig> known mirnas. expression of  <dig> new mirna* forms and  <dig> individual sequences was supported by northern blotting. most of the novel mirna genes are not related to each other and do not share homology with the annotated sequences in the public mirna database, but they are conserved within mammals or have close homologues in primates genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence for  <dig> new mirna and mirna-like sequences . some of these newly identified sequences reside within frequently altered chromosomal regions in nb tumours and may play a role in nb biology.
