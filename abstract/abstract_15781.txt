BACKGROUND
we recently developed a new method to induce human stem cells  differentiation into hematopoietic progenitors by cell extract treatment. here, we report an efficient strategy to generate erythroid progenitors from hescs using cell extract from human fetal liver tissue  with cytokines. human embryoid bodies  obtained of human h <dig> hescs were treated with cell extract from hflt and co-cultured with human fetal liver stromal cells  feeder to induce hematopoietic cells. after the  <dig> days of treatment, hebs were isolated and transplanted into liquid medium with hematopoietic cytokines for erythroid differentiation. characteristics of the erythroid cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, wright-giemsa staining, real-time rt-pcr and related functional assays.


RESULTS
the erythroid cells produced from hebs could differentiate into enucleated cells and expressed globins in a time-dependent manner. they expressed not only embryonic globins but also the adult-globin with the maturation of the erythroid cells. in addition, our data showed that the hebs-derived erythroid cells were able to act as oxygen carriers, indicating that hescs could generate functional mature erythroid cells.


CONCLUSIONS
cell extract exposure with the addition of cytokines resulted in robust erythroid -like differentiation of hebs and these hebs-derived erythroid cells possessed functions similar to mature red blood cells.
