BACKGROUND
dna methylation is an epigenetic regulatory mechanism that plays an essential role in mediating biological processes and determining phenotypic plasticity in organisms. although the horse reference genome and whole transcriptome data are publically available the global dna methylation data are yet to be known.


RESULTS
we report the first genome-wide dna methylation characteristics data from skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and cerebrum tissues of thoroughbred  and jeju  horses, an indigenous korea breed, respectively by methyl-dna immunoprecipitation sequencing. the analysis of the dna methylation patterns indicated that the average methylation density was the lowest in the promoter region, while the density in the coding dna sequence region was the highest. among repeat elements, a relatively high density of methylation was observed in long interspersed nuclear elements compared to short interspersed nuclear elements or long terminal repeat elements. we also successfully identified differential methylated regions through a comparative analysis of corresponding tissues from th and jh, indicating that the gene body regions showed a high methylation density.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide report the first dna methylation landscape and differentially methylated genomic regions  of thoroughbred and jeju horses, providing comprehensive dmrs maps of the dna methylome. these data are invaluable resource to better understanding of epigenetics in the horse providing information for the further biological function analyses.
