BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer  has been widely identified in complete prokaryotic genomes. however, the roles of hgt among members of a microbial community and in evolution remain largely unknown. with the emergence of metagenomics, it is nontrivial to investigate such horizontal flow of genetic materials among members in a microbial community from the natural environment. because of the lack of suitable methods for metagenomics gene transfer detection, microorganisms from a low-complexity community acid mine drainage  with near-complete genomes were used to detect possible gene transfer events and suggest the biological significance.


RESULTS
using the annotation of coding regions by the current tools, a phylogenetic approach, and an approximately unbiased test, we found that hgts in amd organisms are not rare, and we predicted  <dig> putative transferred genes. among them,  <dig> hgt events were determined to be transfer events among the amd members. further analysis of the  <dig> transferred genes revealed that the hgt events affected the functional evolution of archaea or bacteria in amd, and it probably shaped the community structure, such as the dominance of g-plasma in archaea in amd through hgt.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a novel insight into hgt events among microorganisms in natural communities. the interconnectedness between hgt and community evolution is essential to understand microbial community formation and development.
