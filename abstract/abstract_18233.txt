BACKGROUND
nineteen clinically normal snakes: six ball pythons , six burmese pythons , one children’s python , four amazon tree boas , and two malagasy ground boas  were subjected to ultrasound imaging with 21 mhz  and 50 mhz  transducers in order to measure the different structures of the anterior segment in clinically normal snake eyes with the aim to review baseline values for clinically important ophthalmic structures. the ultrasonographic measurements included horizontal spectacle diameter, spectacle thickness, depth of sub-spectacular space and corneal thickness. for comparative purposes, a formalin-fixed head of a burmese python was subjected to micro computed tomography.


RESULTS
in all snakes, the spectacle was thinner than the cornea. there was significant difference in spectacle diameter, and spectacle and corneal thickness between the amazon tree boa and the burmese and ball pythons. there was no difference in the depth of the sub-spectacular space. the results obtained in the burmese python with the 50 mhz transducer were similar to the results obtained with micro computed tomography. images acquired with the 21 mhz transducer included artifacts which may be misinterpreted as ocular structures.


CONCLUSIONS
our measurements of the structures in the anterior segment of the eye can serve as orientative values for snakes examined for ocular diseases. in addition, we demonstrated that using a high frequency transducer minimizes the risk of misinterpreting artifacts as ocular structures.
