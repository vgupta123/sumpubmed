BACKGROUND
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor  is known as a powerful regulator of white blood cell proliferation and differentiation in mammals. we, and others, have shown that g-csf is effective in treating cerebral ischemia in rodents, both relating to infarct size as well as functional recovery. g-csf and its receptor are expressed by neurons, and g-csf regulates apoptosis and neurogenesis, providing a rational basis for its beneficial short- and long-term actions in ischemia. in addition, g-csf may contribute to re-endothelialisation and arteriogenesis in the vasculature of the ischemic penumbra. in addition to these trophic effects, g-csf is a potent neuroprotective factor reliably reducing infarct size in different stroke models.


RESULTS
here, we have further delayed treatment and studied effects of g-csf on infarct volume in the middle cerebral artery occlusion  model and functional outcome in the cortical photothrombotic model. in the mcao model, we applied a single dose of  <dig> μg/kg bodyweight g-csf in rats  <dig> h after onset of ischemia. infarct volume was determined  <dig> h after onset of ischemia. in the rat photothrombotic model, we applied  <dig> μg/kg bodyweight g-csf daily for a period of  <dig> days starting either  <dig> or  <dig> h after induction of ischemia. g-csf both decreased acute infarct volume in the mcao model, and improved recovery in the photothrombotic model at delayed timepoints.


CONCLUSIONS
these data further strengthen g-csf's profile as a unique candidate stroke drug, and provide an experimental basis for application of g-csf in the post-stroke recovery phase.
