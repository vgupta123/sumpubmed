BACKGROUND
trefoil factor  <dig>  mediates mucosal repair and belongs to a highly conserved trefoil factor family proteins which are secreted by epithelial cells in the stomach or colon mucous membrane. tff <dig> forms a homodimer via a disulphide linkage that affects wound healing activity. previous recombinant expressions of tff <dig> were too low yield for industrial application. this study aims to improve the expression level of bioactive recombinant tff <dig>  and facilitate application potency.

methods
the rtff <dig> gene rtff <dig> was synthesized, expressed by escherichia coli and secreted by brevibacillus choshinensis. the rtff1s were purified. the polymeric patterns and wound healing capacities of purified rtff1s were checked.


RESULTS
in escherichia coli,  <dig>  mg/l rtff <dig> was stably expressed as monomer, dimer and oligomer in soluble fraction. in brevebacillus choshinensis, the rtff <dig> was secreted extracellularly at high level  and formed monomer, dimer and oligomer forms. both proteins from different sources were purified by ni-nta chromatography and exhibited the wound healing activities. the rtff <dig> produced by b. choshinensis had better wound healing capability than the rtff <dig> produced by e. coli. after ph  <dig>  buffer treatments, the purified rtff <dig> formed more oligomeric forms as well as better wound healing capability. glycosylation assay and lc-ms/ms spectrometry experiments showed that the rtff <dig> produced by b. choshinensis was unexpectedly glycosylated at n-terminal ser residue. the glycosylation may contribute to the better wound healing capacity.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a potent tool of rtff <dig> production to be applied in gastric damage protection and wound healing. the protein sources from b. choshinensis were more efficient than rtff <dig> produced by e. coli.
