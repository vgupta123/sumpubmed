BACKGROUND
meat protein in the diet has been shown to be beneficial for the growth of lactobacillus in the caecum of growing rats; however, it is unknown whether gut microbiota in middle-aged animals have the same responses to meat protein diets. this study compared the composition of the gut microbiota between young and middle-aged rats after being fed  <dig> % chicken protein diet for 14 days.

methods
feces were collected on day  <dig> and day  <dig> from young rats  and middle-aged rats  fed with  <dig> % chicken protein diets. the composition of the gut bacteria was analyzed by sequencing the v4-v <dig> region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene.


RESULTS
the results showed that the composition of the gut microbiota was significantly different between young and middle-aged rats on both day  <dig> and day  <dig>  the percentage of firmicutes decreased for middle-aged rats  but increased for young rats . the percentage of bacteroidetes increased to  <dig> %  for middle-aged rats and decreased to  <dig> %  for young rats. the relative abundance of the beneficial genus lactobacillus increased in response to the intake of chicken protein in the young group, while it had the opposite effect in the middle-aged group.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study demonstrated that  <dig> % chicken protein diet promoted the beneficial genus lactobacillus in young rats, but the opposite effect were found in the middle-aged group. to evaluate the linkage between diet and host health, age effect should be considered in the future studies.
