BACKGROUND
the canonical core promoter elements consist of the tata box, initiator , downstream core promoter element , tfiib recognition element  and the newly-discovered motif  <dig> element . the motifs for these core promoter elements are highly degenerate, which tends to lead to a high false discovery rate when attempting to detect them in promoter sequences.


RESULTS
in this study, we have performed the first analysis of these core promoter elements in orthologous mouse and human promoters with experimentally-supported transcription start sites. we have identified these various elements using a combination of positional weight matrices  and the degree of conservation of orthologous mouse and human sequences â€“ a procedure that significantly reduces the false positive rate of motif discovery. our analysis of  <dig>  orthologous mouse-human promoter pairs revealed two combinations of three-way synergistic effects, tata-inr-mte and bre-inr-mte. the former has previously been putatively identified in human, but the latter represents a novel synergistic relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that dna sequence conservation can greatly improve the identification of functional core promoter elements in the human genome. the data also underscores the importance of synergistic occurrence of two or more core promoter elements. furthermore, the sequence data and results presented here can help build better computational models for predicting the transcription start sites in the promoter regions, which remains one of the most challenging problems.
