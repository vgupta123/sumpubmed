BACKGROUND
circulating memory t cells can be divided into tissue-specific subsets, which traffic through distinct tissue compartments during physiologic immune surveillance, based on their expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. we reasoned that a bias  of csf t cell expression of known organ-specific trafficking determinants might suggest that homing of t cells to the subarachnoid space could be governed by a cns-specific adhesion molecule or chemokine receptor.


RESULTS
the expression of cutaneous leukocyte antigen  and cc-chemokine receptor  <dig>  as well as the expression of integrin α4β <dig> and ccr <dig>  was analyzed on cd4+ memory t cells in csf from individuals with non-inflammatory neurological diseases using flow cytometry. csf contained similar proportions of cd4+ memory t cells expressing cla, ccr <dig>  integrin α4β <dig> and ccr <dig> as paired blood samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the results extend our previous findings that antigen-experienced cd4+ memory t cells traffic through the csf in proportion to their abundance in the peripheral circulation. furthermore, the ready access of skin- and gut-homing cd4+ memory t cells to the cns compartment via csf has implications for the mechanisms of action of immunotherapeutic strategies, such as oral tolerance or therapeutic immunization, where immunogens are administered using an oral or subcutaneous route.
