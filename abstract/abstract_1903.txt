BACKGROUND
pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci  is the causal agent of wildfire disease in tobacco plants. several pathovars of pseudomonas syringae produce a phytotoxic extracellular metabolite called coronatine . cor has been shown to suppress plant defense responses. interestingly, pstab does not produce cor but still actively suppresses early plant defense responses. it is not clear if pstab produces any extracellular metabolites that actively suppress early defense during bacterial pathogenesis.


RESULTS
we found that the pstab extracellular metabolite extracts  remarkably suppressed stomatal closure and nonhost hypersensitive response  cell death induced by a nonhost pathogen, p. syringae pv. tomato t <dig> , in nicotiana benthamiana. we also found that the accumulation of nonhost pathogens, pst t <dig> and p. syringae pv. glycinea , was increased in n. benthamiana plants upon treatment with pstab extracts . the hr cell death induced by pathogen-associated molecular pattern , gene-for-gene interaction  and ethanol was not delayed or suppressed by pstab extracts. we performed metabolite profiling to investigate the extracellular metabolites from pstab using uplc-qtof-ms and identified  <dig> extracellular metabolites from the pstab supernatant culture. the results from gene expression profiling of pr- <dig>  pr- <dig>  pr- <dig>  pdf <dig> , aba <dig>  coi <dig>  and hsr203j suggest that pstab extracellular metabolites may interfere with sa-mediated defense pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we found that pstab extracts suppress plant defense responses such as stomatal closure and nonhost hr cell death induced by the nonhost bacterial pathogen pst t <dig> in n. benthamiana.
