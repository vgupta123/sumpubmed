BACKGROUND
in recent years, the genome biology community has expended considerable effort to confront the challenges of managing heterogeneous data in a structured and organized way and developed laboratory information management systems  for both raw and processed data. on the other hand, electronic notebooks were developed to record and manage scientific data, and facilitate data-sharing. software which enables both, management of large datasets and digital recording of laboratory procedures would serve a real need in laboratories using medium and high-throughput techniques.


RESULTS
we have developed ilap , a workflow-driven information management system specifically designed to create and manage experimental protocols, and to analyze and share laboratory data. the system combines experimental protocol development, wizard-based data acquisition, and high-throughput data analysis into a single, integrated system. we demonstrate the power and the flexibility of the platform using a microscopy case study based on a combinatorial multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization  protocol and 3d-image reconstruction. ilap is freely available under the open source license agpl from http://genome.tugraz.at/ilap/.


CONCLUSIONS
ilap is a flexible and versatile information management system, which has the potential to close the gap between electronic notebooks and lims and can therefore be of great value for a broad scientific community.
