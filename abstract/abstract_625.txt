BACKGROUND
floral traits within plants can vary with flower position or flowering time. within an inflorescence, sexual allocation of early produced basal flowers is often female-biased while later produced distal flowers are male-biased. such temporal adjustment of floral resource has been considered one of the potential advantages of modularity  in hermaphrodites. however, flowers are under constraints of independent evolution of a given trait. to understand flower diversification within inflorescences, here we examine variation and covariation in floral traits within racemes at the individual and the maternal family level respectively in an alpine herb aconitum gymnandrum .


RESULTS
we found that floral traits varied significantly with flower position and among families, and position effects were family-specific. most of the variance of floral traits was among individuals rather than among flowers within individuals or among families. significant phenotypic correlations between traits were not affected by position, indicating trait integration under shared developmental regulation. in contrast, positive family-mean correlations in floral traits declined gradually from basal to distal flowers , showing position-specificity. therefore, the pattern and magnitude of genetic correlations decreased with flower position.


CONCLUSIONS
this finding on covariation pattern in floral reproductive structures within racemes has not been revealed before, providing insights into temporal variation and position effects in floral traits within plants and the potential advantages of modularity in hermaphrodites.
