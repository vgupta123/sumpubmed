BACKGROUND
accurate computational identification of cis-regulatory motifs is difficult, particularly in eukaryotic promoters, which typically contain multiple short and degenerate dna sequences bound by several interacting factors. enrichment in combinations of rare motifs in the promoter sequence of functionally or evolutionarily related genes among several species is an indicator of conserved transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. this provides a basis for the computational identification of cis-regulatory motifs.


RESULTS
we have used a discriminative seeding dna motif discovery algorithm for an in-depth analysis of  <dig> seed storage protein  gene promoters from three plant families, namely brassicaceae , fabaceae  and poaceae  using backgrounds based on complete sets of promoters from a representative species in each family, namely arabidopsis  heynh.), soybean  merr.) and rice  respectively. we have identified three conserved motifs  in brassicaceae and fabaceae ssp gene promoters that are similar to experimentally characterized seed-specific cis-regulatory elements. fabaceae ssp gene promoter sequences are also enriched in a novel, seed-specific e2fb-like motif. conserved motifs identified in poaceae ssp gene promoters include a gcn4-like motif, two prolamin-box-like motifs and an skn-1-like motif. evidence of the presence of a variant of the tata-box is found in the ssp gene promoters from the three plant families. motifs discovered in ssp gene promoters were used to score whole-genome sets of promoters from arabidopsis, soybean and rice. the highest-scoring promoters are associated with genes coding for different subunits or precursors of seed storage proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
seed storage protein gene promoter motifs are conserved in diverse species, and different plant families are characterized by a distinct combination of conserved motifs. the majority of discovered motifs match experimentally characterized cis-regulatory elements. these results provide a good starting point for further experimental analysis of plant seed-specific promoters and our methodology can be used to unravel more transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in plants and other eukaryotes.
