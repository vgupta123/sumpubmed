BACKGROUND
emamectin benzoate  is a dominating pharmaceutical drug used for the treatment and control of infections by sea lice  on atlantic salmon . fish with an initial mean weight of  <dig> g were experimentally medicated by a standard seven-day eb treatment, and the concentrations of drug in liver, muscle and skin were examined. to investigate how eb affects atlantic salmon transcription in liver, tissues were assessed by microarray and qpcr at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after the initiation of medication.


RESULTS
the pharmacokinetic examination revealed highest eb concentrations in all three tissues at day  <dig>  seven days after the end of the medication period. only modest effects were seen on the transcriptional levels in liver, with small fold-change alterations in transcription throughout the experimental period. gene set enrichment analysis  indicated that eb treatment induced oxidative stress at day  <dig> and inflammation at day  <dig>  the qpcr examinations showed that medication by eb significantly increased the transcription of both hsp <dig> and glutathione-s-transferase  in liver during a period of  <dig> days, compared to un-treated fish, possibly via activation of enzymes involved in phase ii conjugation of metabolism in the liver.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has shown that a standard seven-day eb treatment has only a modest effect on the transcription of genes in liver of atlantic salmon. based on gsea, the medication seems to have produced a temporary oxidative stress response that might have affected protein stability and folding, followed by a secondary inflammatory response.
