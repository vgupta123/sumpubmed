BACKGROUND
typhoid, which is caused by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, remains a major health concern worldwide. multidrug-resistant strains of salmonella have emerged which exhibit increased survivability and virulence, thus leading to increased morbidity. however, little is known about the protective immune response against this microorganism. the outer membrane protein a of bacteria plays an important role in pathogenesis.


RESULTS
we purified ompa from s. enterica serovar typhimurium  and characterized the role of ompa-sal in promoting adaptive and innate immune responses. ompa-sal functionally activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by augmenting expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and major histocompatibility complex classes i and ii. interestingly, ompa-sal induced production of interferon-Î³ from t cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions, thus indicating th1-polarizing capacity. the expression of surface markers and cytokine production in dendritic cells was mediated by the tlr <dig> signaling pathway in a tlr <dig> knock-out system.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that ompa-sal modulates the adaptive immune responses to s. enterica serovar typhimurium by activating dendritic cells and driving th <dig> polarization, which are important properties to consider in the development of effective s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccines and immunotherapy adjuvant.
