BACKGROUND
steroids affect many tissues, including the brain. in the zebra finch, the estrogenic steroid estradiol  is especially effective at promoting growth of the neural circuit specialized for song. in this species, only the males sing and they have a much larger and more interconnected song circuit than females. thus, it was surprising that the gene for 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  <dig> , an enzyme that converts e <dig> to a less potent estrogen, had been mapped to the z sex chromosome. as a consequence, it was likely that hsd17b <dig> was differentially expressed in males  and females  because dosage compensation of z chromosome genes is incomplete in birds. if a higher abundance of hsd17b <dig> mrna in males than females was translated into functional enzyme in the brain, then contrary to expectation, males could produce less e <dig> in their brains than females.


RESULTS
here, we used molecular and biochemical techniques to confirm the hsd17b <dig> z chromosome location in the zebra finch and to determine that hsd17b <dig> mrna and activity were detectable in the early developing and adult brain. as expected, hsd17b <dig> mrna expression levels were higher in males compared to females. this provides further evidence of the incomplete z chromosome inactivation mechanisms in birds. we detected hsd17b <dig> mrna in regions that suggested a role for this enzyme in the early organization and adult function of song nuclei. we did not, however, detect significant sex differences in hsd17b <dig> activity levels in the adult brain.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the hsd17b <dig> gene is expressed and active in the zebra finch brain as an e <dig> metabolizing enzyme, but that dosage compensation of this z-linked gene may occur via post-transcriptional mechanisms.
