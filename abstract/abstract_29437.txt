BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing technologies can effectively detect the entire spectrum of genomic variation and provide a powerful tool for systematic exploration of the universe of common, low frequency and rare variants in the entire genome. however, the current paradigm for genome-wide association studies  is to catalogue and genotype common variants . the methods and study design for testing the association of low frequency  and rare variation  have not been thoroughly investigated. the  <dig> genomes project represents one such endeavour to characterize the human genetic variation pattern at the maf = 1% level as a foundation for association studies. in this report, we explore different strategies and study designs for the near future gwas in the post-era, based on both low coverage pilot data and exon pilot data in  <dig> genomes project.


RESULTS
we investigated the linkage disequilibrium  pattern among common and low frequency snps and its implication for association studies. we found that the ld between low frequency alleles and low frequency alleles, and low frequency alleles and common alleles are much weaker than the ld between common and common alleles. we examined various tagging designs with and without statistical imputation approaches and compare their power against de novo resequencing in mapping causal variants under various disease models. we used the low coverage pilot data which contain ~ <dig> m snps as a hypothetical genotype-array platform  to interrogate its impact on the selection of tag snps, mapping coverage and power of association tests. we found that even after imputation we still observed  <dig> % of low frequency snps which were untaggable and only  <dig> % of the low frequency variation was covered by the pilot  <dig> m array.


CONCLUSIONS
this suggested gwas based on snp arrays would be ill-suited for association studies of low frequency variation.
