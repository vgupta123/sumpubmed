BACKGROUND
mutans streptococci are a group of bacteria significantly contributing to tooth decay. their genetic variability is however still not well understood.


RESULTS
genomes of  <dig> clinical s. mutans isolates of different origins, one isolate of s. sobrinus  and one isolate of s. ratti  were sequenced and comparatively analyzed. genome alignment revealed a mosaic-like structure of genome arrangement. genes related to pathogenicity are found to have high variations among the strains, whereas genes for oxidative stress resistance are well conserved, indicating the importance of this trait in the dental biofilm community. analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks revealed significant differences in  <dig> pathways. a striking dissimilarity is the unique presence of two lactate oxidases in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  probably indicating an unusual capability of this strain in producing h2o <dig> and expanding its ecological niche. in addition, lactate oxidases may form with other enzymes a novel energetic pathway in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> that can remedy its deficiency in citrate utilization pathway.

using  <dig> s. mutans genomes currently available including the strains sequenced in this study, we estimates the theoretical core genome size of s. mutans, and performed modeling of s. mutans pan-genome by applying different fitting models. an “open” pan-genome was inferred.


CONCLUSIONS
the comparative genome analyses revealed diversities in the mutans streptococci group, especially with respect to the virulence related genes and metabolic pathways. the results are helpful for better understanding the evolution and adaptive mechanisms of these oral pathogen microorganisms and for combating them.
