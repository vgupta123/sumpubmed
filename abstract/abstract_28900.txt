BACKGROUND
we hypothesized that genes that are up-regulated in the uterine endometrium at the initiation of conceptus elongation in cattle, and that encode for secreted proteins, contribute to the composition of the uterine luminal fluid  and ultimately, drive conceptus elongation. the aims of this study were to: 1) screen endometrial transcriptomic data for genes that encode secreted proteins on day 13; 2) determine temporal changes in the expression of these genes during the estrous cycle/early pregnancy; 3) determine if expression of these genes is affected by altered concentrations of progesterone  in vivo and 4) determine if the protein products of these genes are detectable in ulf.


RESULTS
of the fourteen candidate genes examined, quantitative real-time pcr analysis revealed the expression of apoa <dig>  arsa, dcn, lcat, muc <dig>  ncdn, nmn, npnt, nxph <dig>  penk, plin <dig> and tinagl <dig> was modulated in the endometrium  as the estrous cycle/early pregnancy progressed. apoa <dig>  dcn and npnt expression was higher in cyclic compared to pregnant heifers, and pregnancy increased  the expression of lcat, ncdn, nmn, plin <dig> and tinagl <dig>  the magnitude of the increase in expression of apoa <dig>  penk and tinagl <dig> on day  <dig> was reduced  in heifers with low p <dig>  furthermore, low p <dig> decreased  the expression of lcat and npnt on day  <dig>  while an early increase  in the expression of nxph <dig> and plin <dig> was observed in heifers with high p <dig>  the protein products of  <dig> of the candidate genes  were detected in the ulf on either days  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> of pregnancy.


CONCLUSIONS
using a candidate gene approach, we determined that both p <dig> concentration and the presence of the conceptus alter endometrial expression of plin <dig>  tinagl <dig>  npnt, lcat, nmn and apoa <dig>  comparison of the expression profiles of these genes to proteins detected in ulf during conceptus elongation  revealed the presence of apoa <dig>  arsa, lcat, ncdn as well as members of the plin family of proteins that may play roles in driving conceptus elongation in cattle.
