BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is present in low number in the intestinal lumen and has been proposed to play a role in crohn's disease . indeed, a highly specific antigen, i <dig>  has been detected in cd patients and correlated to the severity of the disease. we aimed to determine whether p. fluorescens was able to adhere to human intestinal epithelial cells , induce cytotoxicity and activate a proinflammatory response.


RESULTS
behaviour of the clinical strain p. fluorescens mfn <dig> was compared to that of the psychrotrophic strain p. fluorescens mf <dig> and the opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  both strains of p. fluorescens were found to adhere on caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells. their cytotoxicity towards these two cell lines determined by ldh release assays was dose-dependent and higher for the clinical strain mfn <dig> than for mf <dig> but lower than p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the two strains of p. fluorescens also induced il- <dig> secretion by caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells via the ap- <dig> signaling pathway whereas p. aeruginosa pao <dig> potentially used the nf-Îºb pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
the present work shows, for the first time, that p. fluorescens mfn <dig> is able to adhere to iecs, exert cytotoxic effects and induce a proinflammatory reaction. our results are consistent with a possible contribution of p. fluorescens in cd and could explain the presence of specific antibodies against this bacterium in the blood of patients.
