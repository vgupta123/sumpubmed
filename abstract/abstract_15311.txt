BACKGROUND
in bacteria, small non-coding rnas  have been recognized as important regulators of various cellular processes. approximately  <dig> bacterial srnas in total have been reported. however, very few srnas have been identified from phytopathogenic bacteria.


RESULTS
xanthomons campestris pathovar campestris  is the causal agent of black rot disease of cruciferous crops. in this study, a cdna library was constructed from the low-molecular weight rna isolated from the xcc strain  <dig> grown to exponential phase in the minimal medium xvm <dig>  seven srna candidates were obtained by sequencing screen of  <dig>  clones from the library and four of them were confirmed to be srnas by northern hybridization, which were named srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig>  and srna-xcc <dig>  the transcription start and stop sites of these srnas were further determined. blast analysis revealed that the four srnas are novel. bioinformatics prediction showed that a large number of genes with various known or unknown functions in xcc  <dig> are potential targets of srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig> and srna-xcc <dig>  in contrast, only a few genes were predicted to be potential targets of srna-xcc <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified four novel srnas from xcc by a large-scale screen. bioinformatics analysis suggests that they may perform various functions. this work provides the first step toward understanding the role of srnas in the molecular mechanisms of xanthomonas campestris pathogenesis.
