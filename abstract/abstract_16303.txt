BACKGROUND
the process of greek colonization of the central and western mediterranean during the archaic and classical eras has been understudied from the perspective of population genetics. to investigate the y chromosomal demography of greek colonization in the western mediterranean, y-chromosome data consisting of  <dig> ysnps and  <dig> ystrs were compared from  <dig> subjects from provence,  <dig> subjects from smyrna and  <dig> subjects whose paternal ancestry derives from asia minor phokaia, the ancestral embarkation port to the 6th century bce greek colonies of massalia  and alalie .


RESULTS
19% of the phokaian and 12% of the smyrnian representatives were derived for haplogroup e-v <dig>  characteristic of the greek and balkan mainland, while 4% of the provencal,  <dig> % of east corsican and  <dig> % of west corsican samples were derived for e-v <dig>  an admixture analysis estimated that 17% of the y-chromosomes of provence may be attributed to greek colonization. using the following putative neolithic anatolian lineages: j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig>  g2a-m <dig> and j2a1b1-m <dig>  the data predict a 0% neolithic contribution to provence from anatolia. estimates of colonial greek vs. indigenous celto-ligurian demography predict a maximum of a 10% greek contribution, suggesting a greek male elite-dominant input into the iron age provence population.


CONCLUSIONS
given the origin of viniculture in provence is ascribed to massalia, these results suggest that e-v <dig> may trace the demographic and socio-cultural impact of greek colonization in mediterranean europe, a contribution that appears to be considerably larger than that of a neolithic pioneer colonization.
