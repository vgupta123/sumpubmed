BACKGROUND
cancer, much like most human disease, is routinely studied by utilizing model organisms. of these model organisms, mice are often dominant. however, our assumptions of functional equivalence fail to consider the opportunity for divergence conferred by ~ <dig> million years  of independent evolution between these species. for a given set of human disease related genes, it is therefore important to determine if functional equivalency has been retained between species. in this study we test the hypothesis that cancer associated genes have different patterns of substitution akin to adaptive evolution in different mammal lineages.


RESULTS
our analysis of the current literature and colon cancer databases identified  <dig> genes exhibiting colon cancer associated germline mutations. we identified orthologs for these  <dig> genes across a set of high coverage  vertebrate genomes. analysis of these orthologous datasets revealed significant levels of positive selection. evidence of lineage-specific positive selection was identified in  <dig> genes in both ancestral and extant lineages. lineage-specific positive selection was detected in the ancestral euarchontoglires and hominidae lineages for stk <dig>  in the ancestral primate lineage for cdh <dig>  in the ancestral murinae lineage for both sdhc and msh <dig> genes and the ancestral muridae lineage for tsc <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
identifying positive selection in the primate, hominidae, muridae and murinae lineages suggests an ancestral functional shift in these genes between the rodent and primate lineages. analyses such as this, combining evolutionary theory and predictions - along with medically relevant data, can thus provide us with important clues for modeling human diseases.
