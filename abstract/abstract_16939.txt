BACKGROUND
the androgen receptor  is a member of the nuclear receptor  superfamily of ligand-inducible dna transcription factors, and is the major mediator of male sexual development, prostate growth and the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. cell and gene specific regulation by the ar is determined by availability of and interaction with sets of key accessory cofactors. ski-interacting protein  is a cofactor shown to interact with several nrs and a diverse range of other transcription factors. interestingly, skip as part of the spliceosome is thought to link mrna splicing with transcription. skip has not been previously shown to interact with the ar.


RESULTS
the aim of this study was to investigate whether skip interacts with the ar and modulates ar-dependent transcription. here, we show by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that skip is in a complex with the ar. moreover, skip increased 5α-dihydrotestosterone  induced n-terminal/c-terminal ar interaction from 12-fold to almost 300-fold in a two-hybrid assay, and enhanced ar ligand-independent af- <dig> transactivation. skip augmented ligand- and ar-dependent transactivation in pc <dig> prostate cancer cells. live-cell imaging revealed a fast  translocation of ar from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon dht-stimulation. förster resonance energy transfer  experiments suggest a direct ar-skip interaction in the nucleus upon translocation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that skip interacts with ar in the nucleus and enhances ar-dependent transactivation and n/c-interaction supporting a role for skip as an ar co-factor.
