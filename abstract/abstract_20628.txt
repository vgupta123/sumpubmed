BACKGROUND
hepatic expression of several gene products involved in glucose metabolism, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , glucose-6-phosphatase  and insulin-like growth factor binding protein- <dig> , is rapidly and completely inhibited by insulin. this inhibition is mediated through the regulation of a dna element present in each of these gene promoters, that we call the thymine-rich insulin response element . the insulin signalling pathway that results in the inhibition of these gene promoters requires the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase . however, the molecules that connect pi 3-kinase to these gene promoters are not yet fully defined. glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  is inhibited following activation of pi 3-kinase. we have shown previously that inhibitors of gsk- <dig> reduce the activity of two tire-containing gene promoters , whose products are required for gluconeogenesis.


RESULTS
in this report we demonstrate that in h4iie-c <dig> cells, four distinct classes of gsk- <dig> inhibitor mimic the effect of insulin on a third tire-containing gene, igfbp- <dig>  we identify the tire as the minimum requirement for inhibition by these agents, and demonstrate that the target of gsk- <dig> is unlikely to be the postulated tire-binding protein foxo- <dig>  importantly, overexpression of gsk- <dig> in cells reduces the insulin regulation of tire activity as well as endogenous igfbp- <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
these results implicate gsk- <dig> as an intermediate in the pathway from the insulin receptor to the tire. indeed, this is the first demonstration of an absolute requirement for gsk- <dig> inhibition in insulin regulation of gene transcription. these data support the potential use of gsk- <dig> inhibitors in the treatment of insulin resistant states such as type  <dig> diabetes mellitus, but suggest that it will be important to identify all tire-containing genes to assess potential side effects of these agents.
