BACKGROUND
hiv- <dig> targets human cells expressing both the cd <dig> receptor, which binds the viral envelope glycoprotein gp <dig>  as well as either the ccr <dig>  or cxcr <dig>  co-receptors, which interact primarily with the third hypervariable loop  of gp <dig>  determination of hiv- <dig> affinity for either the r <dig> or x <dig> co-receptor on host cells facilitates the inclusion of co-receptor antagonists as a part of patient treatment strategies. a dataset of  <dig> distinct gp <dig> v <dig> loop peptide sequences  is utilized to train predictive classifiers based on implementations of random forest, support vector machine, boosted decision tree, and neural network machine learning algorithms. an in silico mutagenesis procedure employing multibody statistical potentials, computational geometry, and threading of variant v <dig> sequences onto an experimental structure, is used to generate a feature vector representation for each variant whose components measure environmental perturbations at corresponding structural positions.


RESULTS
classifier performance is evaluated based on stratified 10-fold cross-validation, stratified dataset splits , and leave-one-out cross-validation. best reported values of sensitivity , specificity , and precision  for predicting x4-capable hiv- <dig> virus, overall accuracy , matthew's correlation coefficient , balanced error rate , and roc area  all reach critical thresholds, suggesting that the models outperform six other state-of-the-art methods and come closer to competing with phenotype assays.


CONCLUSIONS
the trained classifiers provide instantaneous and reliable predictions regarding hiv- <dig> co-receptor usage, requiring only translated v <dig> loop genotypes as input. furthermore, the novelty of these computational mutagenesis based predictor attributes distinguishes the models as orthogonal and complementary to previous methods that utilize sequence, structure, and/or evolutionary information. the classifiers are available online at http://proteins.gmu.edu/automute.
