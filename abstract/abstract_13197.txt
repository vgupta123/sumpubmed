BACKGROUND
development of resistance against first line drug therapy including cisplatin and paclitaxel in high-grade serous ovarian cancer  presents a major challenge. identifying drug candidates breaking resistance, ideally combined with predictive biomarkers allowing precision use are needed for prolonging progression free survival of ovarian cancer patients.

modeling of molecular processes driving drug resistance in tumor tissue further combined with mechanism of action of drugs provides a strategy for identification of candidate drugs and associated predictive biomarkers.


RESULTS
consolidation of transcriptomics profiles and biomedical literature mining results provides  <dig> proteins linked with ovarian cancer drug resistance. integrating this set on a protein interaction network followed by graph segmentation results in a molecular process model representation of drug resistant hgsoc embedding  <dig> proteins in  <dig> molecular processes. utilizing independent transcriptomics profiles with follow-up data on progression free survival allows deriving molecular biomarker-based classifiers for predicting recurrence under first line therapy. biomarkers of specific relevance are identified in a molecular process encapsulating tgf-beta, mtor, jak-stat and neurotrophin signaling. mechanism of action molecular model representations of cisplatin and paclitaxel embed the very same signaling components, and specifically proteins afflicted with the activation status of the mtor pathway become evident, including vegfa. analyzing mechanism of action interference of the mtor inhibitor sirolimus shows specific impact on the drug resistance signature imposed by cisplatin and paclitaxel, further holding evidence for a synthetic lethal interaction to paclitaxel mechanism of action involving cyclin d <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
stratifying drug resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer via vegfa, and specifically treating with mtor inhibitors in case of activation of the pathway may allow adding precision for overcoming resistance to first line therapy.
