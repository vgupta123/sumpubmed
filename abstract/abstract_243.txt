BACKGROUND
authority and year information have been attached to taxonomic names since linnaean times. the systematic structure of taxonomic nomenclature facilitates the ability to develop tools that can be used to explore historical trends that may be associated with taxonomy.


RESULTS
from the over  <dig>  million taxonomic names that are part of the ubio system  <cit> , approximately  <dig> million names were identified to have taxonomic authority information from the years  <dig> to  <dig>  a pipe-delimited file was then generated, organized according to a linnaean hierarchy and by years from  <dig> to  <dig>  and imported into an excel workbook. a series of macros were developed to create an excel-based tool and a complementary web site to explore the taxonomic data. a cursory and speculative analysis of the data reveals observable trends that may be attributable to significant events that are of both taxonomic  and societal importance . the findings also help quantify the number of taxonomic descriptions that may be made available through digitization initiatives.


CONCLUSIONS
temporal organization of taxonomic data can be used to identify interesting biological epochs relative to historically significant events and ongoing efforts. we have developed an excel workbook and complementary web site that enables one to explore taxonomic trends for linnaean taxonomic groupings, from kingdoms to families.
