BACKGROUND
with the availability of rice and sorghum genome sequences and ongoing efforts to sequence genomes of other cereal and energy crops, the grass family  has become a model system for comparative genomics and for better understanding gene and genome evolution that underlies phenotypic and ecological divergence of plants. while the genomic resources have accumulated rapidly for almost all major lineages of grasses, bamboo remains the only large subfamily of poaceae with little genomic information available in databases, which seriously hampers our ability to take a full advantage of the wealth of grass genomic data for effective comparative studies.


RESULTS
here we report the cloning and sequencing of  <dig>  putative full length cdnas  primarily from moso bamboo, phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens, a large woody bamboo with the highest ecological and economic values of all bamboos. this represents the third largest fl-cdna collection to date of all plant species, and provides the first insight into the gene and genome structures of bamboos. we developed a moso bamboo genomic resource database that so far contained the sequences of  <dig>  putative fl-cdnas and nearly  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  generated in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of fl-cdna sequences show that bamboo diverged from its close relatives such as rice, wheat, and barley through an adaptive radiation. a comparative analysis of the lignin biosynthesis pathway between bamboo and rice suggested that genes encoding caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase may serve as targets for genetic manipulation of lignin content to reduce pollutants generated from bamboo pulping.
