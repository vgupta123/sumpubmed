BACKGROUND
the activator p14k is necessary for the activation of nitrile hydratase . however, it is hard to be expressed heterogeneously. although an n-terminal strep tagged p14k could be successfully expressed from pseudomonas putida, various strategies for the over-expression of p14k are needed to facilitate further application of nhase.


RESULTS
p14k was successfully expressed through fusing a his tag , and was over-expressed through fusing a gst tag  at its n-terminus in the nhase of bordetella petrii dsm  <dig>  the stability of gst-p14k was demonstrated to be higher than that of the his-p14k. in addition, the ser <dig> in the characteristic motif cxlc-ser115-c of the active center of nhase was found to be unnecessary for nhase maturation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results are not only useful for the nhase activator expression and the understanding of the role of ser <dig> during nhase activation, but also helpful for other proteins with difficulty in heterologous expression.
