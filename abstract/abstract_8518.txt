BACKGROUND
in europe, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  belonging to the clonal complex   <dig> has become an important pathogen in horses, circulating in equine clinics and causing both colonization and infection. whether equine mrsa is bound to hospitals or can also circulate in the general horse population is currently unknown. this study, therefore, reports the nasal and perianal mrsa screening of  <dig> horses on  <dig> farms in a suspected high prevalence region .


RESULTS
only one horse  from one farm  tested positive in the nose. it carried a spa type t011-sccmecv isolate, resistant to Î²-lactams and tetracycline, which is typical for livestock-associated mrsa cc <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in the region tested here, horses on horse farms seem unlikely to substantially contribute to the large animal associated st <dig> mrsa reservoir present at intensive animal production units.
