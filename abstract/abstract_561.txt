BACKGROUND
penicillin binding protein  <dig>  of l. monocytogenes has long been thought of as the primary lethal target for β-lactam antibiotics due to the excellent correlation between the mics of different β-lactams and their affinity for this protein. the gene encoding pbp <dig> has not yet been directly identified in this gram-positive bacterium, but based on in silico analysis, this protein is likely to be encoded by lmo <dig>  however, studies examining the effects of mutations in genes encoding known and putative l. monocytogenes pbps have demonstrated that inactivation of lmo <dig> does not affect sensitivity to β-lactams.


RESULTS
in this study, overexpression of lmo <dig> was achieved using an inducible  expression system. this permitted the direct demonstration that lmo <dig> encodes pbp <dig>  pbp <dig> overexpression was accompanied by slightly elevated pbp <dig> expression. the recombinant strain overexpressing pbp <dig> displayed significant growth retardation and greatly reduced cell length in the stationary phase of growth in culture. in antibiotic susceptibility assays, the strain overexpressing pbp <dig> displayed increased sensitivity to subinhibitory concentrations of several β-lactams and decreased survival in the presence of a lethal dose of penicillin g. however, the mic values of the tested β-lactams for this recombinant strain were unchanged compared to the parent strain.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study allows a reevaluation of the importance of pbp <dig> in the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams. it is clear that pbp <dig> is not the primary lethal target for β-lactams, since neither the absence nor an excess of this protein affect the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to these antibiotics. the elevated level of pbp <dig> expression observed in the recombinant strain overexpressing pbp <dig> demonstrates that the composition of the l. monocytogenes cell wall is subject to tight regulation. the observed changes in the morphology of stationary phase cells in response to pbp <dig> overexpression suggests the involvement of this protein in cell division during this phase of growth.
