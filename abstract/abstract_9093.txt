BACKGROUND
ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif is an adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the induction of interferons in response to viral infection. in the initial stage of the intracellular antiviral response two rna helicases, retinoic acid inducible gene-i  and melanoma differentiation-association gene  <dig> , are independently able to bind viral rna in the cytoplasm. the  <dig> kda protein ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif contains an n-terminal caspase activation and recruitment  domain that associates with the card regions of rig-i and mda <dig>  ultimately leading to the induction of type i interferons. as a first step towards understanding the molecular basis of this important adaptor protein we have undertaken structural studies of the ips- <dig> mavs/visa/cardif card region.


RESULTS
the crystal structure of human ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif card has been determined to  <dig> Ã… resolution. the protein was expressed and crystallized as a maltose-binding protein  fusion protein. the mbp and ips- <dig> components each form a distinct domain within the structure. ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif card adopts a characteristic six-helix bundle with a greek-key topology and, in common with a number of other known card structures, contains two major polar surfaces on opposite sides of the molecule. one face has a surface-exposed, disordered tryptophan residue that may explain the poor solubility of untagged expression constructs.


CONCLUSIONS
the ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif card domain adopts the classic card fold with an asymmetric surface charge distribution that is typical of card domains involved in homotypic protein-protein interactions. the location of the two polar areas on ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif card suggest possible types of associations that this domain makes with the two card domains of mda <dig> or rig-i. the n-terminal card domains of rig-i and mda <dig> share greatest sequence similarity with ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif card and this has allowed modelling of their structures. these models show a very different charge profile for the equivalent surfaces compared to ips-1/mavs/visa/cardif card.
