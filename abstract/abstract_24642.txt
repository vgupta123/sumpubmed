BACKGROUND
epidermal growth factor receptor  is involved in the development of many human malignant tumors and plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. antagonists of egfr can suppress the growth of several malignancies; however, their therapeutic effect in adenoid cystic carcinoma  is controversial.


RESULTS
the increased proliferation of two acc cell lines induced by egf-treatment was reversed by nimotuzumab. regardless of egf stimulation, nimotuzumab-treated acc cells were arrested in g <dig> phase and showed decreased expression of ki <dig>  in addition, egf activated the mapk-dependent pathway and up-regulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> and snail, enhancing the invasive potential of an acc cell line . the effects of egf were down-regulated by nimotuzumab treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that nimotuzumab can inhibit the growth and invasion of acc cells induced by egf, probably through inactivation of erk phosphorylation. thus, nimotuzumab should be considered as a promising novel agent for the treatment of acc.
