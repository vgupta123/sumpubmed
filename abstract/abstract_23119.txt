BACKGROUND
consanguinity is an important risk factor for autosomal recessive  disorders. extended genomic regions identical by descent  in the offspring of consanguineous parents give rise to recessive disorders with identical  pathogenic variants in both alleles. however, many clinical phenotypes presenting in the offspring of consanguineous couples are still of unknown etiology. nowadays advances in high throughput sequencing provide an excellent opportunity to achieve a molecular diagnosis or to identify novel candidate genes.


RESULTS
to exploit all available information from the family structure we developed catch, an algorithm that combines genotyped snps of all family members for the optimal detection of runs of homozygosity  and exome sequencing data from one affected individual to identify putative causative variants in consanguineous families.


CONCLUSIONS
catch proved to be effective in discovering known or putative new causative variants in  <dig> out of  <dig> consanguineous families. among them, novel variants causative of familial thrombocytopenia, sclerosis bone dysplasia and the first homozygous loss-of-function mutation in fgfr <dig> in human causing severe skeletal deformities, tall stature and hearing impairment were identified.
