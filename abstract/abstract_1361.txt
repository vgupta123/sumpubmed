BACKGROUND
few genetic factors predisposing to the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  have been identified, but the pathology itself seems to be a true multifactorial disease in which complex interactions between environmental and genetic susceptibility factors take place. the purpose of this study was to approach genetic data with an innovative statistical method such as artificial neural networks to identify a possible genetic background predisposing to the disease. a dna multiarray panel was applied to genotype more than  <dig> polymorphisms within  <dig> genes selected from pathways of lipid and homocysteine metabolism, regulation of blood pressure, coagulation, inflammation, cellular adhesion and matrix integrity, in  <dig> sporadic als patients and  <dig> controls. advanced intelligent systems based on novel coupling of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms have been applied. the results obtained have been compared with those derived from the use of standard neural networks and classical statistical analysis


RESULTS
advanced intelligent systems based on novel coupling of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms have been applied. the results obtained have been compared with those derived from the use of standard neural networks and classical statistical analysis. an unexpected discovery of a strong genetic background in sporadic als using a dna multiarray panel and analytical processing of the data with advanced artificial neural networks was found. the predictive accuracy obtained with linear discriminant analysis and standard artificial neural networks ranged from 70% to 79%  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  respectively. the corresponding value obtained with advanced intelligent systems reached an average of  <dig> % . this latter approach allowed the identification of seven genetic variants essential to differentiate cases from controls: apolipoprotein e arg158cys; hepatic lipase - <dig> c/t; endothelial nitric oxide synthase  <dig> c/t and glu298asp; vitamin k-dependent coagulation factor seven arg353glu, glycoprotein ia/iia  <dig> g/a and e-selectin ser128arg.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an alternative and reliable method to approach complex diseases. indeed, the application of a novel artificial intelligence-based method offers a new insight into genetic markers of sporadic als pointing out the existence of a strong genetic background.
