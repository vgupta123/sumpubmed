BACKGROUND
the increasing global importance of rift valley fever  is clearly demonstrated by its geographical expansion. the presence of a wide range of host and vector species, and the epidemiological characteristics of rvf, have led to concerns that epidemics will continue to occur in previously unaffected regions of africa. the proximity of the sahrawi territories of western sahara to endemic countries, such as mauritania, senegal, and mali with periodic isolation of virus and serological evidence of rvf, and the intensive livestock trade in the region results in a serious risk of rvf spread in the sahrawi territories, and potentially from there to the maghreb and beyond. a sero-epidemiological survey was conducted in the saharawi territories between march and april  <dig> to investigate the possible presence of the rvf virus  and associated risk factors. a two-stage cluster sampling design was used, incorporating  <dig> sampling sites.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> serum samples was collected from  <dig> sheep,  <dig> goats and  <dig> camels. eleven samples  tested positive for igg against the rvfv. there were clusters of high seroprevalence located mostly in the tifariti  and mehaires  regions, with the tifariti event having been found in one single flock . goats and older animals were at a significantly increased risk being seropositive .


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest potential rvf activity in the study area, where intense livestock movement and trade with neighbouring countries might be considered as a primary determinant in the spread of the disease. the importance of a continuous field investigation is reinforced, in light of the risk of rvf expansion to historically unaffected regions of africa.
