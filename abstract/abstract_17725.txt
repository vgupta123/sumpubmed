BACKGROUND
accelerometers are valid, practical and reliable tools for the measurement of habitual physical activity . quantification of pa in horses is desirable for use in research and clinical settings. the objective of this study was to evaluate a triaxial accelerometer for objective measurement of pa in the horse by assessment of their practical utility and validity.

horses were recruited to establish both the optimal site of accelerometer attachment and questionnaire designed to explore owner acceptance. validity and cut-off values were obtained by assessing pa at various gaits. validation study-  <dig> horses wore the accelerometer while being filmed for 10 min each of rest, walking and trotting and  <dig> mins of canter work. practical utility study- five horses wore accelerometers on polls and withers for 18 h; compliance and relative data losses were quantified.


RESULTS
accelerometry output differed significantly between the four pa levels  for both wither and poll placement. for withers placement, roc analyses found optimal sensitivity and specificity at a cut-off of < <dig> counts per minute  for rest , 967–2424 cpm for trotting  and ≥2425 cpm for cantering . attachment at the poll resulted in optimal sensitivity and specificity at a cut-off of < <dig> counts per minute  for rest , 1546–2609 cpm for trotting  and ≥2610 cpm for cantering  in terms of practical utility, accelerometry was well tolerated and owner acceptance high.


CONCLUSIONS
accelerometry data correlated well with varying levels of in-hand equine activity. the use of accelerometers is a valid method for objective measurement of controlled pa in the horse.
