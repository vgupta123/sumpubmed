BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus is most commonly associated with foodborne illness  but is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe and fatal infections. several multilocus sequence typing  schemes have recently been developed to genotype b. cereus and analysis has suggested a clonal or weakly clonal population structure for b. cereus and its close relatives b. anthracis and b. thuringiensis. in this study we used mlst to determine if b. cereus isolates associated with illnesses of varying severity  illness) were clonal or formed clonal complexes.


RESULTS
a retrospective analysis of  <dig> clinical b. cereus isolates submitted to the centers for disease control and prevention between  <dig> and  <dig> was conducted. clinical isolates from severe infections , gastrointestinal  illness , and associated isolates from food  were selected for analysis using mlst. the  <dig> isolates were diverse and comprised  <dig> sequence types  in two distinct clades. of the  <dig> isolates associated with serious illness,  <dig> clustered in clade  <dig> while  <dig> were in clade  <dig>  isolates associated with gi illness were also found throughout clades  <dig> and  <dig>  while no isolates in this study belonged to clade  <dig>  all the isolates from this study belonging to the clade 1/cereus iii lineage were associated with severe disease while isolates belonging to clade1/cereus ii contained isolates primarily associated with severe disease and emetic illness. only three sts were observed more than once for epidemiologically distinct isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
sts of clinical b. cereus isolates were phylogenetically diverse and distributed among two of three previously described clades. greater numbers of strains will need to be analyzed to confirm if specific lineages or clonal complexes are more likely to contain clinical isolates or be associated with specific illness, similar to b. anthracis and emetic b. cereus isolates.
