BACKGROUND
natural antisense transcripts  are a class of rnas that contain a sequence complementary to other transcripts. nats occur widely in eukaryotes and play critical roles in post-transcriptional regulation. soybean nat sequences are predicted in the plantnatsdb, but detailed analyses of these nats remain to be performed.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  nats, including  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats, were predicted in soybean. each sense transcript had 1â€“ <dig> antisense transcripts. we identified  <dig> trans-nats using rt-pcr amplification. additionally, we identified  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats that gave rise to small rnas; these were enriched in the nat overlapping region. the most abundant small rnas were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nt in length. the generation of small rnas was biased to one stand of the nats, and the degradation of nats was biased. high-throughput sequencing of the degradome allowed for the global identification of nat small interfering rnas  targets.  <dig> target genes for  <dig> of these nat-sirnas were identified. the nat-sirna target could be one transcript of a given nat, or from other gene transcripts. we identified five nat transcripts containing a hairpin structure that is characteristic of pre-mirna. we identified a total of  <dig> microrna  targets that had antisense transcripts in soybean.


CONCLUSIONS
we globally identified nat-sirnas, and the targets of nat-sirnas in soybean. it is likely that the cis-nats, trans-nats, nat-sirnas, mirnas, and mirna targets form complex regulatory networks.
