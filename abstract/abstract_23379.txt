BACKGROUND
successful early folliculogenesis is crucial for female reproductive function. it requires appropriate gene specific expression of the different types of ovarian cells at different developmental stages. to date, most gene expression studies on the ovary were conducted in rodents and did not distinguish the type of cell. in mono-ovulating species, few studies have addressed gene expression profiles and mainly concerned human oocytes.


RESULTS
we used a laser capture microdissection method combined with rna-seq technology to explore the transcriptome in oocytes and granulosa cells  during development of the sheep ovarian follicle. we first documented the expression profile of  <dig>  <dig> genes, then focused on the  <dig>  <dig> genes showing differential expression between oocytes and gcs. enriched functional categories such as oocyte meiotic arrest and gc steroid synthesis reflect two distinct cell fates. we identified the implication of gc signal transduction pathways such as shh, wnt and rho gtpase. in addition, signaling pathways  and gc transzonal projections suggest the existence of complex cell-cell interactions. finally, we highlighted several transcription regulators and specifically expressed genes that likely play an important role in early folliculogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive exploration of transcriptomes derived from in vivo oocytes and gcs at key stages in early follicular development in sheep. collectively, our data advance our understanding of early folliculogenesis in mono-ovulating species and will be a valuable resource for unraveling human ovarian dysfunction such as premature ovarian failure .
