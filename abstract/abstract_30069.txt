BACKGROUND
butyrate naturally produced by intestinal fiber fermentation is the main nutrient for colonocytes, but the metabolic effect of the fraction reaching the liver is not totally known. after glycogen hepatic depletion in the 48-hour fasting rat, we monitored the effect of /g body weight versus isocaloric  or isoglucidic  control force-feeding on in vivo changes in hepatic glycogen and atp contents evaluated ex vivo by nmr in the isolated and perfused liver.


RESULTS
the change in glycogen was biphasic with  an initial linear period where presence of butyrate in the diet increased  the net synthesis rate  versus glucose  <dig>  mg/g only , and  a plateau of glycogen store followed by a depletion. butyrate delayed the establishment of the equilibrium between glycogenosynthetic and glycogenolytic fluxes from the 6th to 8th hour post-feeding. the maximal glycogen content was then  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  at the 8th hour, which was significantly higher than with the isocaloric control diet  and the isoglucidic control one . after butyrate ingestion, atp content increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to a plateau of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww at the 8th hour post-feeding  .


CONCLUSIONS
the main hepatic effect of butyrate is a sparing effect on glycogen storage explained  by competition between butyrate and glucose oxidation, glucose being preferentially directed to glycogenosynthesis during the post-prandial state; and  by a likely reduced glycogenolysis from the newly synthesized glycogen. this first demonstration of the improvement of liver glycogen storage by acute butyrate supply may be an important contribution to explaining the beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis of nutritional supply increasing butyrate amount such as fiber diets.
