BACKGROUND
the accurate prediction of ligand binding residues from amino acid sequences is important for the automated functional annotation of novel proteins. in the previous two casp experiments, the most successful methods in the function prediction category were those which used structural superpositions of 3d models and related templates with bound ligands in order to identify putative contacting residues. however, whilst most of this prediction process can be automated, visual inspection and manual adjustments of parameters, such as the distance thresholds used for each target, have often been required to prevent over prediction. here we describe a novel method funfold, which uses an automatic approach for cluster identification and residue selection. the software provided can easily be integrated into existing fold recognition servers, requiring only a 3d model and list of templates as inputs. a simple web interface is also provided allowing access to non-expert users. the method has been benchmarked against the top servers and manual prediction groups tested at both casp <dig> and casp <dig> 


RESULTS
the funfold method shows a significant improvement over the best available servers and is shown to be competitive with the top manual prediction groups that were tested at casp <dig>  the funfold method is also competitive with both the top server and manual methods tested at casp <dig>  when tested using common subsets of targets, the predictions from funfold are shown to achieve a significantly higher mean matthews correlation coefficient  scores and binding-site distance test  scores than all server methods that were tested at casp <dig>  testing on the casp <dig> set showed no statistically significant separation in performance between funfold and the other top server groups tested.


CONCLUSIONS
the funfold software is freely available as both a standalone package and a prediction server, providing competitive ligand binding site residue predictions for expert and non-expert users alike. the software provides a new fully automated approach for structure based function prediction using 3d models of proteins.
