BACKGROUND
information generated via microarrays might uncover interactions between the mammary gland and streptococcus uberis  that could help identify control measures for the prevention and spread of s. uberis mastitis, as well as improve overall animal health and welfare, and decrease economic losses to dairy farmers. the main objective of this study was to determine the most affected gene networks and pathways in mammary tissue in response to an intramammary infection  with s. uberis and relate these with other physiological measurements associated with immune and/or metabolic responses to mastitis challenge with s. uberis o140j.


RESULTS
streptococcus uberis imi resulted in  <dig>   differentially expressed genes . within this set of deg, we uncovered  <dig> significantly enriched canonical pathways , the majority of which were signaling pathways. among the most inhibited were lxr/rxr signaling and pparα/rxrα signaling. pathways activated by imi were il- <dig> signaling and il- <dig> signaling which likely reflected counter mechanisms of mammary tissue to respond to infection. of the  <dig>  deg,  <dig>  were up-regulated during imi and were primarily involved with the immune response, e.g., il <dig>  tnf, il <dig>  il <dig>  sell, lyz, and saa <dig>  genes down-regulated  included those associated with milk fat synthesis, e.g., lpin <dig>  lpl, cd <dig>  and btn1a <dig>  network analysis of deg indicated that tnf had positive relationships with genes involved with immune system function  and negative relationships with genes involved with lipid metabolism  and antioxidant activity .


CONCLUSIONS
results provided novel information into the early signaling and metabolic pathways in mammary tissue that are associated with the innate immune response to s. uberis infection. our study indicated that imi challenge with s. uberis  elicited a strong transcriptomic response, leading to potent activation of pro-inflammatory pathways that were associated with a marked inhibition of lipid synthesis, stress-activated kinase signaling cascades, and ppar signaling . this latter effect may provide a mechanistic explanation for the inverse relationship between immune response and milk fat synthesis.
