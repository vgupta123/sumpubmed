BACKGROUND
linear regression models are used to quantitatively predict drug resistance, the phenotype, from the hiv- <dig> viral genotype. as new antiretroviral drugs become available, new resistance pathways emerge and the number of resistance associated mutations continues to increase. to accurately identify which drug options are left, the main goal of the modeling has been to maximize predictivity and not interpretability. however, we originally selected linear regression as the preferred method for its transparency as opposed to other techniques such as neural networks. here, we apply a method to lower the complexity of these phenotype prediction models using a 3-fold cross-validated selection of mutations.


RESULTS
compared to standard stepwise regression we were able to reduce the number of mutations in the reverse transcriptase  inhibitor models as well as the number of interaction terms accounting for synergistic and antagonistic effects. this reduction in complexity was most significant for the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  models, while maintaining prediction accuracy and retaining virtually all known resistance associated mutations as first order terms in the models. furthermore, for etravirine  a better performance was seen on two years of unseen data. by analyzing the phenotype prediction models we identified a list of forty novel nnrti mutations, putatively associated with resistance. the resistance association of novel variants at known nnrti resistance positions:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and of mutations at positions not previously linked with nnrti resistance:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was confirmed by phenotyping site-directed mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
we successfully identified and validated novel nnrti resistance associated mutations by developing parsimonious resistance prediction models in which repeated cross-validation within the stepwise regression was applied. our model selection technique is computationally feasible for large data sets and provides an approach to the continued identification of resistance-causing mutations.
