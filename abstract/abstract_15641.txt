BACKGROUND
the eggplant  genome is relatively unexplored, especially compared to those of the other major solanaceae crops tomato and potato. in particular, no snp markers are publicly available; on the other hand, over  <dig>  ssr markers were developed and publicly available. we have combined the recently developed restriction-site associated dna  approach with illumina dna sequencing for rapid and mass discovery of both snp and ssr markers for eggplant.


RESULTS
rad tags were generated from the genomic dna of a pair of eggplant mapping parents, and sequenced to produce ~ <dig>  mb of sequences arrangeable into ~ <dig>  contigs. the resulting non-redundant genomic sequence dataset consisted of ~ <dig>  sequences, of which ~29% were putative coding sequences and ~70% were in common between the mapping parents. the shared sequences allowed the discovery of ~ <dig>  snps and nearly  <dig>  indels, equivalent to a snp frequency of  <dig>  per kb and an indel frequency of  <dig>  per kb. over  <dig>  of the snps are likely to be mappable via the illumina goldengate assay. a subset of  <dig> snps was used to successfully fingerprint a panel of eggplant germplasm, producing a set of informative diversity data. the rad sequences also included nearly  <dig>  putative ssrs, and primer pairs were designed to amplify  <dig>  loci.


CONCLUSIONS
the high throughput sequencing of the rad tags allowed the discovery of a large number of dna markers, which will prove useful for extending our current knowledge of the genome organization of eggplant, for assisting in marker-aided selection and for carrying out comparative genomic analyses within the solanaceae family.
