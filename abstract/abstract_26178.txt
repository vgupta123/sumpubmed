BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that have been found to play important roles in silencing target genes and that are involved in the regulation of various normal cellular processes. until now their implication in the mammary gland biology was suggested by few studies mainly focusing on pathological situations allowing the characterization of mirnas as markers of breast cancer tumour classes. if in the normal mammary gland, the expression of known mirnas has been studied in human and mice but the full repertoire of mirnas expressed in this tissue is not yet available.


RESULTS
to extend the repertoire of mouse mammary gland expressed mirnas, we have constructed several libraries of small mirnas allowing the cloning of  <dig> sequences. after bioinformatics' analysis,  <dig> known mirna  and  <dig> new mirnas were identified. expression of  <dig> out of the  <dig> has been confirmed by rt-pcr. expression of none of them was found to be mammary specific, despite a tissue-restricted distribution of some of them. no correlation could be established between their expression pattern and evolutionary conservation. six of them appear to be mouse specific. in several cases, multiple potential precursors of mirna were present in the genome and we have developed a strategy to determine which of them was able to mature the mirna.


CONCLUSIONS
the cloning approach has allowed improving the repertoire of mirnas in the mammary gland, an evolutionary recent organ. this tissue is a good candidate to find tissue-specific mirnas and to detect mirna specific to mammals. we provide evidence for  <dig> new mirna. if none of them is mammary gland specific, a few of them are not ubiquitously expressed. for the first time  <dig> mouse specific mirna have been identified.
