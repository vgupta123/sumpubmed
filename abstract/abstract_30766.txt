BACKGROUND
the midgut undergoes histolysis and remodeling during the larval to adult transition in holometabolous insects, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood.


RESULTS
using suppression subtractive hybridization , we identified a  <dig> bp cdna predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid protein, which we call hmg <dig>  northern and western blot analysis suggested that high levels of hmg <dig> are expressed in the midgut during molting, but not during metamorphosis. hmg <dig> protein was detected by immunofluorescence within the membrane of fat bodies and the basement membrane of the midgut of both molting and feeding larvae, but not in metamorphically committed larvae. in situ hybridization revealed that hmg <dig> transcripts mainly localized to the columnar cells of the midgut. interestingly, a non-steroidal ecdysone agonist, rh- <dig>  significantly upregulated expression of hmg <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these observations suggest that hmg <dig> encodes a larval-specific protein that may participate in sustaining larval midgut during larval development, possibly in response to ecdysteroid in vivo. this study will enlighten our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tissue histolysis during metamorphosis.
