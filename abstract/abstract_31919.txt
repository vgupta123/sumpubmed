BACKGROUND
the discovery of the importance of angiogenesis in tumor growth has emphasized the need to find specific vascular targets for tumor-targeted therapies. previously, using phage display technology, we identified the peptide gx <dig> as having the ability to target the gastric cancer vasculature. the present study investigated the bioactivities of gx <dig>  as well as its potential ability to cooperate with recombinant mutant human tumor necrosis factor alpha , in gastric cancer therapy.


RESULTS
tetrazolium salt  assay showed that gx <dig> could inhibit cell proliferation of both human umbilical vein endothelial cells   and huvec with tumor endothelium characteristics, generated by culturing in tumor-conditioned medium  . flow-cytometry  and western blot assays showed that gx <dig> increased the rate of apoptosis from 11% to 31%  by up-regulating caspase  <dig> expression level. a chorioallantoic membrane assay indicated that gx <dig> could suppress neovascularization in vivo, with the microvessel count decreasing from  <dig> to  <dig> . when gx <dig> was fused to rmhtnfα, gx1-rmhtnfα selectively concentrated in the gastric cancer vasculature, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence and emission-computed tomography. in vitro mtt and fcm assays showed that, compared to rmhtnfα alone, gx1-rmhtnfα was more effective at suppressing co-huvec proliferation  and inducing apoptosis . in a tumor formation test, gx1-rmhtnfα more effectively inhibited tumor growth than rmhtnfα , with less systemic toxicity as measured by body weight . these therapeutic effects may be mediated by selectively enhanced tumor vascular permeability, as indicated by evan's blue assay.


CONCLUSIONS
gx <dig> had both homing activity and the ability to inhibit vascular endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and neovascularization in vivo. furthermore, when gx <dig> was conjugated to rmhtnfα, the fusion protein was selectively delivered to targeted tumor sites, significantly improving the anti-tumor activity of rmhtnfα and decreasing systemic toxicity. these results demonstrate the potential of gx <dig> as a homing peptide in vascular targeted therapy for gastric cancer.
