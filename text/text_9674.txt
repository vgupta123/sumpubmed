BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques, and an intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of affected individuals. a  <dig> amino acid long aβ <dig> peptide generated by proteolytic processing of the app protein is a major component of the amyloid plaques, in which it is mainly represented in the form of detergent-insoluble amyloid fibers . historically, the aβ <dig> fibers have been considered to be the major pathogenic agents of ad. recently, this hypothesis has been challenged by findings suggesting that fibrillar aggregates may represent inert dead-end products of the aβ <dig> aggregation pathway. considerable evidence now suggests that the primary neurotoxic effects are associated with soluble sds-stable assemblies of aβ <dig>  such as  <dig> kda aβ <dig> dodecamers  <cit> , or even smaller, low-n  oligomers of aβ <dig>  which seem to appear during the early stages of aβ <dig> assembly , and could give rise to larger oligomers. thus, the focus of putative therapeutic interventions have shifted towards unraveling compounds that inhibit the earliest stages of aβ <dig> oligomerization. a number of chemical screens have uncovered molecules that inhibit fibrillization of the aβ <dig> peptide . an interesting escherichia coli model of protein solubility control was recently suggested by m. delisa and colleagues  <cit> , which the authors used to isolate solubility-enhanced variants of aβ <dig>  these studies, however, did not directly address the issue of inhibiting the earliest stages of aβ <dig> assembly, i.e. formation of the sds-stable soluble low-n oligomers. this aspect is important, as inhibition of the wrong step may lead to accumulation of toxic aβ <dig> intermediates.

yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a simple and readily manipulable organism that has been successfully used as a model for various medicinal studies , including neurodegenerative disorders, associated with the deposition of amyloid aggregates  <cit> . one of the most valuable contributions of yeast biology to the investigation of neurodegenerative disorders in animals was made by studying yeast prions . the yeast translational termination factor sup35p can form self-propagating infectious amyloid aggregates that arise spontaneously in the cell and manifest a prion phenotype referred to as . the essential sup35p protein is composed of three domains. the  <dig> amino acid long n-terminal domain  is glutamine and aparagine rich, dispensable for viability, and required and sufficient for the prion properties of sup35p. while the function of the highly charged middle  domain remains unclear, the c-terminal rf  domain of sup35p performs termination of protein translation and is essential for viability.

prion aggregates of sup35p are transmitted to daughter cells along with the cytoplasm from the mother cell during cell division  <cit> . the yeast chaperone hsp <dig>  a member of the aaa+ protein family  <cit>  is required for the successful maintenance of the  prion  <cit> . hsp <dig> shears the sds-stable sup35p prion amyloid aggregates into smaller structures in an atp-dependent manner  <cit>  and therefore maintains them in numbers sufficient for the successful transmission to the daughter cell  <cit> . the atpase activity of hsp <dig> is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of guanidine  <cit> , which is therefore employed as a yeast prion-curing agent  <cit> .

in this study, we describe a yeast model of the initial steps of aβ <dig> oligomerization. we show that the easily scored activity of sup35p's mrf domain is impaired in aβmrf fusions because the aβ <dig> causes the fusion to form sds-stable low-n oligomers. furthermore, we found that guanidine treatment increases, while gene disruption of hsp <dig> decreases, oligomerization of the fusion protein, and that these changes are reflected by the yeast phenotype. this model system represents a convenient tool to perform chemical and genetic screens for agents that interfere with the earliest steps of aβ <dig> oligomerization.

RESULTS
the activity of the essential translational termination factor sup35p  is conveniently assayed in vivo by examining the efficiency with which protein synthesis terminates at a premature stop codon . the assay uses the ade1- <dig> nonsense allele. strains carrying this mutation and bearing fully active nmrf produce only a truncated  version of ade1p, and as a result cannot grow on synthetic medium lacking adenine , while they grow normally on synthetic medium supplemented with adenine . in addition, these cells accumulate a red intermediate of the adenine synthesis pathway when grown on complex medium. however, if the efficiency of translational termination at the premature stop codon of the ade1- <dig> allele is compromised, the cells gain the ability to grow on -ade  and do not accumulate red pigment. for example, cells expressing the complete sup35p containing the n , m , and rf  domain, are white and ade+ when nmrf is in the aggregated  prion form . cells expressing an aggregation-deficient and therefore fully functional form of sup35p lacking the non-essential n-terminal domain  are red and ade- . thus, this well established system reliably distinguishes between fully active monomer, and malfunctioning aggregated forms of nmrf  <cit> .

to establish a model of aβ <dig> oligomerization in s. cerevisiae, we fused the aβ <dig> peptide with mrf , and containing an ha tag between the m and rf domains. the resulting protein, aβmrf  was mutagenized in its aβ <dig> portion according to a recent model of aβ <dig> oligomerization  <cit> . the model suggests that binding of one aβ <dig> molecule to another occurs through four regions: amino acids 15– <dig>  24– <dig>  35– <dig>  and 40– <dig> of one molecule bind to the corresponding regions in another molecule. substitutions of phe <dig>  phe <dig>  and ile <dig> were previously shown to inhibit aggregation of aβ <dig> in vitro and prevent its neurotoxic effects  <cit> . to obtain an oligomerization-deficient control for the aβmrf fusion protein, we disrupted the first and the second aggregation-important regions of aβ <dig> by making double aβf <dig> tmrf  or triple aβf <dig> t/i31pmrf  substitutions in the aβ <dig> portion of aβmrf. these constructs were expressed in a 74d- <dig>  sup35Δ strain, and therefore were the only sources of the essential sup35p's rf domain.

yeast cells expressing the aβmrf fusion protein were white on complex medium and grew on -ade, suggesting that the translation termination activity of the fusion protein was impaired . in contrast, yeast expressing aβm1mrf or aβm2mrf were dark pink on complex medium and ade-, suggesting that the efficiency of translation termination was almost completely restored by the mutations in the aβ <dig> portion of the fusion protein. no growth difference was detected in the control experiment on +ade medium. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of aβ <dig> in the fusion protein caused it to aggregate into sds-stable oligomers, thereby affecting its translation termination activity.

to test whether aβmrf formed sds-stable oligomers, we analyzed yeast lysates treated with 1% sds at room temperature by immunoblotting. as shown elsewhere  <cit> , prionized nmrf  migrates in the form of sds-stable aggregates, while mrf, which is unable to prionize, is monomeric . the pool of aβmrf contained both monomers and sds-stable complexes migrating at the predicted positions for aβmrf low-n oligomers  . in agarose gels, the aβmrf monomers  migrated at ~ <dig> kda , rather than at ~ <dig> kda as they did in the acrylamide gels . nevertheless, the positions of the sds-stable complexes increased with monomer size increments in both gel systems. the sds-stable oligomers of aβmrf were able to withstand treatment with 2% sds at room temperature and disaggregated into monomers only after boiling . we hypothesize that the presence of aβ <dig> confers aβmrf with the ability to form low-n oligomers  similar to the oligomerization of the aβ <dig> peptide in vitro and in the human brain  <cit> .

unlike antibodies against the rf domain, the efficacy with which anti-aβ antibodies recognized oligomers of aβmrf decreased as the size of the oligomers increased . nevertheless, oligomers of aβmrf were stably detected by these antibodies . we observed a similar phenomenon when we detected sds-stable amyloid oligomers of nmrf, which represent structures interacting through the ~ <dig> kda n-terminal domains, while the ~ <dig> kda mrf domains on their c termini are exposed to the solvent. the efficiency with which these oligomers are detected with anti-n terminal antibodies is lower that with antibodies against the c-terminal rf domain  <cit> . apparently, even after sds electrophoresis the physical access of the antibodies to the target epitopes remains impeded due to the assembly state of the target protein. these observations further corroborate our hypothesis that aβmrf molecules are oligomerized through their aβ <dig> portions.

to obtain additional evidence that it is the intact aβ <dig> peptide fused to the mrf that conferred the aβmrf fusion protein with the ability to form low-n oligomers, we analyzed point mutants of aβmrf by sds-electrophoresis and immunoblotting. we expected that mutations in the aggregation-important regions of aβ <dig> would inhibit oligomerization of the fusion protein. consistent with our expectations, disruption of a single aggregation-important region of aβ <dig>  reduced its ability to form low-n oligomers . disruption of a second aggregation-important region  further inhibited oligomerization of the protein. however, small amounts of aβm2mrf were found in the form of dimers. this is probably due to the fact that this construct still retained two out of four aggregation-important regions intact. the presence of aβm2mrf dimers explains our observation that these cells were dark pink on complex medium, and were not entirely as red as when a non-tagged mrf protein was expressed . in addition, the mere presence of aβ <dig> on the n-terminus of mrf might slightly inhibit the translation termination activity of the fusion protein. nevertheless, the fact that point mutations in the aggregation-important regions of aβ <dig> impeded oligomerization of aβmrf and restored its activity, illustrates the ability of the system to clearly distinguish between different levels of aβmrf oligomerization.

we did not detect aβmrf oligomers using the generic oligomer-specific antibodies that recognize oligomers of different amyloidogenic proteins . these antibodies appear not to recognize oligomers of aβ <dig> smaller than octamers  <cit> , and the oligomers of aβmrf did not reach this size. nor could we detect aβmrf-containing structures that correspond to fibres of aβmrf, although we successfully used sds-electrophoresis in agarose previously to analyze different amyloid fibres  <cit> . in figure 2b we show that amyloid fibres made of recombinant aβ <dig> peptide are detected in the upper part of the agarose gel, while aβmrf never formed structures of this size . it is possible that the absence of large aβmrf assemblies can be attributed to disaggregating activity of unknown cellular factors, or that the presence of a large mrf domain impedes the ability of aβmrf to assemble into structures larger than the low-n oligomers.

as growth of  yeast in the presence of the prion curing agent guanidine  <cit>  increased the size of sds-resistant sup35p aggregates  <cit> , we wondered if it would affect aβmrf oligomers similarly. thus we grew sup35Δ cells expressing aβmrf, aβm1mrf, or aβm2mrf in the presence of  <dig>  mm guanidine. strikingly, guanidine dramatically increased the amount of aβmrf and aβm1mrf oligomers, while depleting the monomeric pool of the proteins . no such effect was detected with the control aβm2mrf protein. as guanidine enhances the sup35p  aggregate size by inhibiting the atpase activity of hsp <dig>  we wondered if guanidine's effect on the accumulation of aβmrf oligomers was likewise due to hsp <dig> inhibition. contrary to this hypothesis, deletion of hsp <dig> decreased the proportion of aβmrf oligomers in three independent hsp104Δ clones . in addition, hsp104Δ led to a decrease in the total amount of aβmrf in the cells by ~40%, while having no effect on the level of aβm2mrf protein . as might be expected, such a decrease in the total amount of aβmrf in hsp104Δ cells resulted in more frequent readthrough of the premature stop codon of the ade1- <dig> allele: hsp104Δ caused aβmrf-expressing sup35Δ cells to grow slightly better on -ade, while having no effect on aβm2mrf-expressing sup35Δ cells .

these results suggest that hsp <dig> is not the target of guanidine that stimulated aβmrf oligomerization, and that guanidine therefore may affect other cellular factors. corroboratively, guanidine stimulated oligomerization of aβmrf even in the absence of hsp <dig> .

to test if hsp <dig> interacts with aβmrf, we used ha-tagged aβmrf and ha-tagged mrf to co-immunoprecipitate hsp <dig>  indeed, hsp <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with aβmrf, but not with mrf . this is consistent with observations made elsewhere  <cit>  suggesting that hsp <dig> interacts with aβ <dig> in vitro. we hypothesize that in our system oligomers of aβmrf undergo continuous disaggregation, and at the same time oligomers and monomers of aβmrf undergo degradation, as a result of interaction between an unknown cellular factor and the aβ <dig> portion of aβmrf. we show that hsp <dig> binds to the aβ <dig> portion of aβmrf and may therefore physically impede interaction between aβ <dig> and the factors that trigger degradation and disaggregation of the fusion protein. consistent with this, deletion of hsp <dig> led to a ~40% decrease in the total amount of the aβmrf protein , possibly as a result of increased susceptibility of aβmrf to degradation-triggering factors. at the same time, deletion of hsp <dig> shifted the equilibrium between oligomers and monomers such that the monomer's share in the overall pool of aβmrf increased from  <dig> to 47%, possibly as a result of aβmrf disaggregation. as disaggregation of protein aggregates in yeast usually requires energy from atp  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that guanidine may specifically inhibit the atpase activity of the unknown disaggregating factors, as guanidine is able to inhibit the atpase activity of hsp <dig>  <cit> .

recent evidence suggests that chaperones play critical roles in protecting neuronal cells from the deleterious effects of amyloid aggregates and their precursors . such a protective mechanism may involve degradation and/or disaggregation of toxic intermediates. in yeast, disaggregation of aggregated protein is carried out by the chaperone machinery, which includes hsp <dig>  hsp70/hsp <dig>  and small heat shock proteins  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  <cit> . all of these chaperones except for hsp <dig> have homologs in mammals. it was shown that hsp <dig> facilitates disaggregation and refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase  <cit>  and citrate synthase  <cit>  by hsp <dig> and hsp70/hsp <dig>  the disaggregating activity of the yeast chaperone machinery is not limited to amorphous protein aggregates. overexpression of hsp <dig> together with hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  <cit> , or hsp <dig> together with hsp <dig>  <cit> , or hsp <dig> alone  <cit>  increased the solubility of polyglutamine aggregates in yeast models of huntington's disease, while deletion of hsp <dig> led to solubulization of polyglutamine aggregates  <cit> . the direct implication of chaperone machinery to the pathology of alzheimer's disease is still obscure. the yeast system described in this study provides an opportunity to examine the ability of different compounds  to interfere with the process of aβmrf oligomerization. abrogation of oligomerization of the aβmrf will lead in our system to the accumulation of aβmrf monomers, causing inhibition of growth in the absence of adenine, and a redder color on complex medium, thus providing a simple functional readout.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present a yeast model system focused on the initial steps of aβ <dig> oligomerization. we fused the aβ <dig> peptide to the mrf domain of the yeast translation termination factor, sup35p, and monitored its activity by the growth of yeast on different media. the presence of the aβ <dig> caused the aβmrf fusion protein to form sds-stable low-n oligomers, which appear to mimic the ability of the natural aβ <dig> peptide to form low-n oligomers. the oligomerization of aβmrf compromised its translational termination activity causing a more frequent readthrough of the ade1-14's premature stop codon, which was easily scored by yeast growth . point mutations previously shown to inhibit aβ <dig> aggregation in vitro, were made in the aβ <dig> portion of the fusion protein. these mutations both inhibited oligomerization and restored activity to the fusion protein. thus, using this reporter system it is possible to assay the degree of aβmrf oligomerization by examining the growth of yeast on complex and adenine-deficient media. we also demonstrate that the yeast prion curing agent guanidine enhances the level of sds-stable aβmrf oligomers, presumably by inactivating factors that degrade and/or disaggregate them. this effect is not caused by inactivation of the yeast chaperone hsp <dig>  which appears to protect aβmrf from the effects of such factors. this model system represents a convenient tool to test or perform chemical and genetic screens for agents that interfere with the earliest steps of aβ <dig> oligomerization.
