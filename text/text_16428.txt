BACKGROUND
interferon  was first identified by isaacs in  <dig>  <cit> . ifn belongs to the cytokine family of proteins and has a wide range of physiological functions, such as inhibiting viral infection, regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, and modulating immune responses  <cit> . the ifn system is one of the first defensive barriers against viral infection and is an important component of natural antiviral immunity  <cit> .

ifns are key cytokines with antiviral, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities. based on gene sequences, chromosome location, and receptor specificity, the members of the ifn family are classified into i, ii, and iii subtypes. subtype i includes ifn-α, β, ω, ε, κ, δ and ζ  <cit> , and type i ifns have been shown to possess effective antiviral activity. type ii ifn is also known as immune ifn   <cit> . interferon-γ, a cytokine produced by t lymphocytes and natural killer cells, plays a central role in the modulation of the immune response  <cit> . the type iii interferons are also known as the ifn-λs and are more related to type i ifns based on their amino acid sequence and protein function. however, the more limited tissue expression of ifn-λ receptors suggests that type iii ifns do not simply recapitulate the type i ifn antiviral system. they have antiviral effects in the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin mucosa, epithelial cells, and some tumor cells. among the ifn family, ifn-α is one of the major modulators of the defensive system against viral infection in mammals and has been widely used in the clinic as a therapeutic for viral infection  <cit> . all ifns identified in vertebrates are secreted proteins, with ifn-α being secreted from virus-infected white blood cells. the human ifn family consists of  <dig> subtypes. despite differences in their amino acid sequences, the subtypes of human ifn-α have similar 3d structures and similar physiological and biochemical characteristics, such as stability and recognition by surface receptors. human ifn-α is composed of 166– <dig> amino acids and has no glycosylation sites. the average molecular weight of ifn-α is about 19 kda. the homology of amino acids among ifn-αs from different subtypes ranges from about 75–95%  <cit> . the ifn-αs can be further classified into subtypes, which have different biological functions.

ifn is a conserved molecule that has been found in humans, mouse, sheep, rabbits, dogs, weasels and other mammals, as well as in fish, turtles and insects. ifns have been used in both human and veterinary medicine, not only for the treatment of viral infections but also for cancer. mink  is one of the major fur animals and its health problems have become an important issue for the fur industry. infection by the canine distemper virus, parvovirus, and aleutian mink disease virus among minks has caused serious economic losses to the fur animal industry  <cit> . therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly antiviral drugs to control viral infections in mink. in this study, we cloned and expressed the genes for  <dig> ifn-α subtypes in the mink and characterized their antiviral activity.

RESULTS
analysis of mink ifn-α genes
by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , we successfully amplified the predicted 564 bp mink ifn-α  cdna. restriction enzyme analysis confirmed that we had correctly subcloned miifn-α cdnas into recombinant plasmids. dnastar software analysis demonstrated that the cdnas of  <dig> subtypes of miifn-α were 564 bp long and encoded  <dig> amino acids. due to the different amino acids components, there were slight variations in molecular weight among the  <dig> miifn-α subtypes. the genbank registration number and molecular weight of the cloned  <dig> miifn-α subtypes are listed in table  <dig> table  <dig>

most secreted proteins in eukaryotes are modified on the amino acid asn located in the consensus sequence asn.xaa.ser/thr  by an n-glycan, a process known as n-glycosylation  <cit> . analysis using netnglyc server  <dig>   predicted that ifn-α1– <dig> contained one glycosylation site at 54nytn <dig>  whereas ifn-α4– <dig> contained two glycosylation sites. in addition to the glycosylation site at 54nytn <dig>  ifn-α4– <dig> and ifn-α <dig> contained a glycosylation site at 101nttl <dig>  whereas ifn-α10– <dig> contained a glycosylation site at 101nmtl <dig>  further analysis demonstrated that the number and position of cysteines were not the same among the  <dig> subtypes. ifn-α1– <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig> and ifn-α <dig> contained  <dig> cysteine residues at the same positions of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig> and ifn-α <dig> contained only  <dig> cysteine residues with a cysteine residue at position  <dig> replaced by serine . these data demonstrate the existence of a single nucleotide polymorphism  among miifn-α subtypes, in agreement with previous reports on snps of ifn-α in other species  <cit> .figure  <dig>

expression and purification of miifn-α in e. coli
to evaluate the biological activity of miifn-α, we subcloned  <dig> miifn-α cdnas into a prokaryotic expression vector pproex htb and induced their expression by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside  in e. coli bl <dig>  sodium dodecyl sulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis showed the presence of protein bands at 19 kda , consistent with the predicted molecular weights of miifn-α. protein solubility analysis showed that miifn-α recombinant proteins were in the form of inclusion bodies. sds-page analysis of the isolated inclusion bodies showed that 80% of recombinant proteins were in inclusion bodies. western blot analysis of partially purified miifn-α with an anti-6xhis antibody showed a specific band of about 19 kda .figure  <dig>

antiviral activity of recombinant miifn-α
to examine the antiviral activity of recombinant miifn-αs, we first used the wish/ vesicular stomatitis virus  system. compared to the cells without virus infection, challenge of wish cells with  <dig> tcid <dig> vsv for 24 h resulted in significant cell lesions. however, pretreatment with  <dig> subtypes of miifn-α attenuated vsv-induced cell lesions, with miifn-α <dig> and miifn-α <dig> demonstrating the strongest effects. further analysis showed that the effective antiviral concentrations of miifn-α <dig> and miifn-α <dig> in wish cells were  <dig>  ×  <dig> 4 iu/mg and  <dig>  ×  <dig> 3 iu/mg, respectively.

to confirm that the antiviral activity of recombinant miifn-α is not limited to vsv, we employed the canine distemper virus /vero system. we selected miifn-α <dig> and miifn-α <dig>  because these two subtypes exhibited the strongest antiviral activity against vsv. the results showed that recombinant miifn-α <dig> and miifn-α <dig> significantly inhibited cdv-induced cell lesions. further analysis showed that  <dig>  μg purified miifn-α <dig> protein and  <dig>  μg purified miifn-α <dig> could suppress  <dig> tcid <dig> cdv-mediated cell lesions. these data indicate that miifn-α <dig> exhibits the strongest antiviral activity against vsv and cdv.

discussion
the fur animal industry is expanding in the northeast and western parts of china. however, the health of fur animals has been compromised by viral infections, such as those with cdv, parvovirus, and aleutian mink virus. ifn was first recognized on the basis of its anti-viral activity and only later shown to act primarily as an immunomodulator. ifn-α has been identified from different species, but the biological activity of miifn-α has not been tested until now. to determine whether miifnα also exhibits antiviral activity similar to ifns from other species, we examined the ability of recombinant miifn-αs to inhibit the replication of vsv.

using rt-pcr, we successfully amplified the predicted 564 bp mink ifn-α cdna. the homologies of  <dig> miifn-α subtypes were  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively. it is surprising that all the subtypes have the same size, whereas size differences have been reported in other species. in  <dig> pig ifn-αs, multiple sequence alignment revealed a c-terminal deletion of  <dig> residues in six ifn-α subtypes   <cit> . the antiviral activities of intact porcine ifn-α genes are approximately 2– <dig> times higher than those of the subtypes with c-terminal deletions in wish cells and 15– <dig> times higher in pk <dig> cells. in addition, the size of feline ifn-α subtypes are different; feline ifn-α <dig> has five additional amino acids inserted at position  <dig>  which are not present in the other four subtypes  <cit> . more than  <dig> different subtypes of ifn-α have been reported in mice and  <dig> or more subtypes have been reported to exist in humans. in mouse, the size of ifn-α subtypes is variable. however, the size of the human ifn subtypes is consistent. in mice injected with plasmids encoding murine ifn-α <dig>  muifn-α <dig> or muifn-α <dig>  and subsequently challenged with murine cytomegalovirus , muifn-α <dig> exerted the greatest antiviral effect. in another study, eight different human cell-derived ifn-α subtypes were tested for their antiviral activities. human ifn-α <dig> was found to be the most potent, whereas huifn-α <dig> exhibited the least antiviral activity. in the current study, we compared the antiviral effects of the miifn-α subtypes. there is no evidence to prove that the strength of antiviral activity is related to the size of the ifn-α subtype. phylogenetic analysis  further indicated that ifn-α was subdivided into two monophyletic lineages: chicken  and mammalian. the mammalian branch can be divided into carnivores and herbivores. the similarity of mink, domestic ferret, eurasian badger, giant panda, dog, fox, and cat ifn-αs is consistent with their grouping within the carnivore monophyletic group . indeed, both gene conversion and gene duplication have shaped the evolution of the ifn-α gene family in eutherian species  <cit> . the features of miifn-α subtype sequences provide more support for this view.

ifn has a broad-spectrum of antiviral effects and represents an ideal choice for the development of antiviral drugs. ifn was the first cytokine approved by the us food and drug administration for clinical application. among the members of the ifn family, ifn-α has relatively higher antiviral activity. ifn-α has been identified from different species, including birds, rodents, and primates  <cit> . ifn-α is a multi-gene family, with each member located on the same chromosome within a certain region  <cit> . one unique characteristic of the ifn-α gene is that it has only one open reading frame  without any introns. for example, dog has  <dig> ifn-α genes, cat has  <dig> ifn-α genes, giant panda has  <dig> ifn-α genes, and the marmot has  <dig> ifn-α genes. for each subtype of ifn-α gene of the same species, the sequence of the pcr product is the same whether using genomic dna or cdna as the template. in this study, we cloned  <dig> miifn-α genes, including six functional genes and two pseudogenes. in vitro assays showed that only the product of the functional ifn gene had antiviral activity. the reason for the genetic diversity of ifn-α during evolution is still unclear, but different subtypes have distinct biological activities  <cit> . tan et al. cloned  <dig> ifn-α genes from the giant panda and found that ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  and ifn-α <dig> had higher activity whereas ifn-α <dig> had low biological activity in  <dig> cells   <cit> . furthermore, ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  and ifn-α <dig> demonstrated higher activity in b <dig> cells, whereas ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  and ifn-α <dig> showed higher activity in k <dig> cells  <cit> . taira et al. cloned  <dig> dog ifn-α genes and found that rcaifn-α <dig> demonstrated high anti-vsv activity. in addition, the anti- canine adenovirus - <dig> activity of rcaifn-α <dig> in madin-darby canine kidney  cells was 33– <dig> times higher than the anti-vsv activity, but rcaifn-α <dig> had no effects on chv- <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that ifn-α has many subtypes, most of which have antiviral activity in different types of cells. although the ifn-α family has many pseudogenes that can be transcribed into mrna, these pseudogenes have no anti-viral function. the potential roles of the pseudogenes of ifn-α remain to be determined.

effective induction of ifn expression plays an important role during the immune response to viral infection. ifn-α is a multi-gene family consisting of different subtypes with high homology and similar function. however, recent studies have demonstrated that there are functional differences among the subtypes, probably due to the different amino acid sequences. indeed, our  <dig> cloned miifn-αs demonstrated a variety of constituent amino acids in each subtype. miifn-α4– <dig> had two n-glycosylation sites, whereas miifn-α1– <dig> had only one n-glycosylation site. ifn-α1– <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  and ifn-α <dig> had  <dig> cysteine residues, whereas ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  and ifn-α <dig> contained only  <dig> cysteine residues. antiviral activity analysis showed that only ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  ifn-α <dig>  and ifn-α <dig> had antiviral function. it will be interesting to investigate whether n-glycoslylation sites are essential for the antiviral activity of ifn-α.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this study for the first time, we have cloned  <dig> subtypes of the miifn-α gene and successfully expressed them in e. coli. most of the purified recombinant miifn-α subtypes demonstrated antiviral activity against vsv and cdv, and miifn-α <dig> exhibited the highest antiviral activity. therefore, the miifn-α <dig> subtype is a promising candidate for the development of effective antiviral drugs for the fur animal industry.
