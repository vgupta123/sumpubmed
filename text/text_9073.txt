BACKGROUND
plant volatiles play diverse roles in the interactions between plants and their environment. flower volatiles, for example, can attract pollinators while vegetative volatiles are involved in plant defence, either directly by repelling the attacker or indirectly by e.g. attracting herbivore enemies . the formation and emission of vegetative volatiles is often induced by chewing or sucking herbivores and the resulting volatile blends usually contain dozens of substances from diverse classes of natural compounds . herbivore-induced volatile blends are in general dominated by terpenes and green leaf volatiles , but comprise also aromatic compounds, alcohols, and nitrogen-containing amino acid derivatives  <cit> . while the formation and biological roles of terpenes and glvs have been extensively studied in the past, our knowledge about the other components of herbivore-induced volatile blends is still limited.

nitrogen-containing vegetative volatiles such as aldoximes, nitriles and nitro compounds are widely distributed among the angiosperms and have been reported from e.g. the salicaceae, fabaceae, solanaceae, cucurbitaceae, rutaceae, rosaceae, and poaceae  <cit> . poplars , for example, release a complex mixture of aliphatic aldoximes, aliphatic and aromatic nitriles, and an aromatic nitro compound in response to herbivory by gypsy moth  larvae  <cit> . although these nitrogen-containing volatiles are minor components of the total blend, they likely play important roles in indirect and direct poplar defence. electrophysiological recordings and olfactometer bioassays revealed that volatile aldoximes were more attractive for a gypsy moth parasitoid than the major terpenes and glvs  <cit> . moreover, poplar nitriles were shown to be repellent for gypsy moth caterpillars, while volatile and semi-volatile aldoximes had toxic effects on these larvae  <cit> .

aldoximes and nitriles are produced from amino acids through the action of cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  of the cyp <dig> and cyp71/ <dig> families . cyp <dig> enzymes accept amino acids as substrates and catalyse the formation of aldoximes by two successive n-hydroxylations, a dehydration and a decarboxylation reaction  <cit> . the aldoximes formed can then serve as substrates for cyp <dig> enzymes, which convert them into the corresponding nitriles  <cit> . the first characterized cyp <dig> enzyme, cyp79a <dig> from sorghum bicolor, was identified and characterized in  <dig> by sibbesen and co-workers  <cit> . it catalyses the reaction from l-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime, which is further converted into the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin in sorghum  <cit> . while most of the cyp <dig> enzymes characterized so far produce aldoximes as precursors for cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates, and other non-volatile nitrogen-containing defence compounds, a few cyp79s from two different poplar species  have been reported to be responsible for herbivore-induced volatile production  <cit> . cyp79s involved in cyanogenic glucoside and glucosinolate formation usually possess high substrate specificity, thus determining the specificity of the entire pathway . in contrast, poplar cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> have broader substrate specificity and produce complex mixtures of volatile and semi-volatile aldoximes  <cit> .

to expand our knowledge about the formation of volatile aldoximes and nitriles, we have now begun to investigate and compare their biosynthesis in the genus erythroxylum. two species with different geographical origins and cultivation histories were chosen for this analysis. erythroxylum coca is an economically and pharmacologically important crop cultivated on the eastern slopes of the andes since more than  <dig> years. e. fischerii, in contrast, is a wild species native to the tropical forests in africa. both species are members of the erythroxylaceae, which belong, like poplars, to the diverse order malpighiales. since it has been shown that the formation of volatiles can be induced by artificial treatments with the plant hormone jasmonic acid  , we measured and compared volatile emission in response to ja treatment in e. coca and e. fischeri and detected numerous nitrogen-containing compounds. candidate cyp <dig> genes isolated from both species were then heterologously expressed in yeast, and enzyme characterization and gene expression analysis indicated a potential function of individual erythroxylum cyp <dig> proteins in volatile aldoxime formation.

RESULTS
jasmonic acid induces the emission of nitrogenous volatiles in erythroxylum coca and e. fischeri
many plant species respond to herbivory with an increased ja accumulation that induces the biosynthesis of diverse plant defence compounds including nitrogen-containing volatiles  <cit> . hence to study the formation of nitrogenous volatiles in erythroxylum species, we collected and compared the volatile blends of untreated and ja-treated twigs of e. coca and e. fischeri. although both species emitted volatiles from untreated twigs, ja-treatment significantly increased volatile emission . the blends from control and ja-treated twigs of e. coca and e. fischeri were dominated by monoterpenes -β-ocimene, mentha- <dig> ,8-triene, and linalool), sesquiterpenes -α-farnesene) and the homoterpenes - <dig> -dimethylnona- <dig> ,7-triene  and - <dig> ,12-trimethyltrideca- <dig> , <dig> -tetraene . in addition, both species produced significant amounts of nitrogenous volatiles such as -2-methylbutyraldoxime, -3-methylbutyraldoxime, benzyl cyanide, phenylnitroethane, an unidentified nitro compound, and indole in response to ja treatment . as typical herbivore-induced vegetative volatiles, green leaf volatiles were also present in ja-induced e. coca and e. fischeri blends. notably, the qualitative compositions of the ja-induced volatile blends of both species were nearly identical and the total amounts of released volatiles were in the same range. however, there were major quantitative differences in the emission of single volatiles between e. coca and e. fischeri . while e. coca, for instance, emitted β-elemene as major sesquiterpene and produced minor amounts of -α-farnesene, e. fischerii released large amounts of -α-farnesene and produced only traces of β-elemene. another remarkable difference was found for indole, which was one of the dominant nitrogen-containing volatiles in e. coca but was a minor compound in e. fischeri.table  <dig> volatile compounds of erythroxylum coca and e. fischeri released from untreated twigs  and jasmonic acid-treated twigs

identification of cyp <dig> enzymes from e. coca and e. fischeri
to identify putative erythroxylum cyp <dig> genes, a tblastn search against an in-house  <dig> cdna sequencing database of e. coca young leaf tissue  <cit>  was conducted using the amino acid sequence of cyp79d6v <dig> from populus trichocarpa  <cit>  as input sequence. one sequence representing a putative p <dig> enzyme of the cyp <dig> family was identified. amplification of this gene resulted in two highly homologous sequences that were designated as cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> according to the general p <dig> nomenclature . pcr with cdna made from ja-treated e. fischeri leaves using the primer pair designed for amplification of e. coca sequences revealed an additional gene . to identify further potential cyp79d candidates, primers specific to conserved regions among the obtained genes were designed and pcr was performed with cdna made from ja-treated erythroxylum leaves. while most of the resulting amplicons were identical to cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig>  one fragment amplified from e. fischeri cdna showed sequence divergence and the isolated full-length clone was designated as cyp79d <dig> 

motifs reported to be conserved in nearly all p <dig> enzymes, such as the proproxxpro motif at the n-terminus, the heme binding site propheglyxglyargargxcysxgly, and the progluargphe motif, could be identified in the obtained erythroxylum cyp <dig> sequences . in comparison to the general p <dig> consensus sequences  <cit> , erythroxylum cyp <dig> motifs showed substitutions characteristic for the cyp <dig> family. moreover, a cyp79-specific asnpro motif in one of the proposed substrate binding sites  <cit>  was also found in the erythroxylum sequences . a dendrogram analysis showed that erythroxylum cyp <dig> enzymes grouped together with cyp79d6v <dig>  cyp79d7v <dig>  and cyp79d6v <dig> from poplar and cyp79d enzymes from other plants .fig.  <dig> amino acid sequence alignment of erythroxylum cyp79s with cyp79a <dig> from sorghum bicolor and cyp79d6v <dig> and cyp79d7v <dig> from populus trichocarpa. black boxes mark conserved residues and grey boxes mark residues with similar physicochemical properties. the conserved motifs are labeled and ‘np’ indicates the exchange of the generally conserved cyp motif, thr-, with the asn-pro motif typical of the cyp <dig> family

to test the enzymatic activity of the identified erythroxylum cyp79s, genes were heterologously expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae  and microsomes harbouring recombinant protein were incubated with the potential amino acid substrates l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, l-leucine, and l-isoleucine in the presence of nadph as cosubstrate. cyp79d <dig> showed narrow substrate specificity and was only able to accept tryptophan as substrate, converting it into -indole-3-acetaldoxime . in contrast, cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig> accepted all tested amino acids and produced -phenylacetaldoxime, -p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime, -indole-3-acetaldoxime, -3-methylbutyraldoxime, and -2-methylbutyraldoxime, respectively, from the amino acids listed above . assays using microsomes from yeast cells expressing the empty vector, assays without nadph and assays with boiled proteins showed no activity .fig.  <dig> biochemical characterization of erythroxylum coca cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig>  the genes were heterologously expressed in saccharomyces cerevisae and microsome preparations containing the recombinant proteins were incubated with the potential amino acid substrates l-phe, l-tyr, l-trp, l-leu, and l-ile. the respective reaction products of each substrate are depicted sequentially next to their lc-ms/ms traces

gene expression analysis of erythroxylum cyp <dig> genes
quantitative real-time pcr  was used to compare transcript accumulation of cyp <dig> genes between untreated and ja-treated twigs in e. coca and e. fischeri. to identify reference genes with stable expression under our experimental conditions, we analysed transcript accumulation of a set of nine potential e. coca qrt-pcr reference genes  <cit>  in untreated and ja-treated leaves of e. coca and e. fischeri . expressed protein ec <dig> and the clathrin adaptor complex subunit ec <dig> were chosen as reference genes for qrt-pcr analysis of cyp <dig> genes in e. coca and e. fischeri, respectively, based on their low ct value variability between the different treatments . in e. coca, cyp79d <dig> showed a significantly upregulated gene expression in ja-treated twigs in comparison to untreated controls . in contrast, transcript accumulation of cyp79d <dig> was not influenced by the treatment . in e. fischeri, cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> were both significantly upregulated after ja treatment , but the average cq value for cyp79d <dig> was higher than the average cq value for cyp79d <dig> in ja-treated leaves , suggesting higher gene expression for cyp79d <dig> in comparison to cyp79d <dig> after ja treatment.fig.  <dig> trancript abundance of cyp79d genes in jasmonic acid-treated and untreated control leaves of erythroxylum coca  and e. fischeri . twigs were cut and placed in either tap water  or jasmonic acid  for  <dig> h. gene expression was determined by qrt-pcr. means and standard errors are shown . the kruskal-wallis rank sum test was used to test for statistical significance. p-values ≤  <dig>  indicate significant difference between the treatments. ctr, control treatment; ja, jasmonic acid treatment




accumulation of aldoximes, indole-3-acetic acid, and amino acids in ja-treated erythroxylum plants
to test whether cyp <dig> products accumulate in ja-treated and untreated leaves of e. coca and e. fischeri, we analysed leaf methanol extracts using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. -phenylacetaldoxime, -indole-3-acetaldoxime, -2-methylbutyraldoxime, and -3-methylbutyraldoxime showed significantly increased accumulation in both species after ja-treatment in comparison to untreated controls . only trace amounts of these aldoximes could be detected in untreated leaves. notably, the induced accumulation of -2-methylbutyraldoxime and -3-methylbutyraldoxime corresponded well with the emission of these compounds from ja-treated leaves . the absence of the aromatic aldoximes -phenylacetaldoxime and -indole-3-acetaldoxime in the volatile blends  is most likely due to their low volatility in comparison to the aliphatic aldoximes. in contrast to the aldoximes, indole-3-acetic acid , a potential conversion product of -indole-3-acetaldoxime, was constitutively produced in untreated and ja-treated leaves of both e. coca and e. fischeri .fig.  <dig> the accumulation of different aldoximes and indole-3-acetic acid  in jasmonic acid-treated and untreated control leaves of erythroxylum coca and e. fischeri. twigs were cut and placed in either tap water  or jasmonic acid  for  <dig> h. aldoximes and iaa were extracted with methanol and analyzed using lc-ms/ms. means and standard errors are shown . the kruskal-wallis rank sum test was used to test for statistical significance. p-values ≤  <dig>  indicate significant difference between the treatments. ctr, control treatment; ja, jasmonic acid treatment




the analysis of amino acids as potential cyp <dig> substrates in ja-treated leaves vs. untreated control leaves revealed a significant induction for l-ala, l-val, l-thr, l-leu, l-ile, l-his, l-phe, l-trp, and l-tyr in e. coca and for l-ala, l-asp, and l-gln in e. fischeri .

discussion
the production of volatiles in response to insect herbivory appears to be a widespread part of plant defence. herbivore-induced volatiles can influence the feeding or oviposition behaviour of herbivores and are described to attract herbivore enemies such as parasitic wasps, predatory arthropods, and insectivorous birds  <cit> . jasmonic acid, a phytohormone known to be involved in several physiological processes, plays an important role in triggering different plant defence reactions including volatile formation  <cit> . thus, pure ja or its derivatives and mimics are often used as artificial elicitors for the induction of vegetative volatile emission  <cit> . in this study we showed that ja also induced the emission of complex volatile blends in e. coca and e. fischeri. the blends were dominated by terpenes and glvs, but also possessed nitrogen-containing compounds such as the nitrile benzyl cyanide, phenylnitroethane, and some aliphatic aldoximes . the roles of herbivore-induced nitrogenous volatiles in direct and indirect plant defense have recently been investigated in poplar. olfactometer experiments showed that benzyl cyanide and two other volatile nitriles had a strong repellant activity against gypsy moth caterpillars, a generalist herbivore known to feed on poplar  <cit> . volatile aliphatic aldoximes were found to be attractive for a parasitoid of gypsy moth larvae in laboratory as well as field experiments  <cit> , and the semi-volatile -phenylacetaldoxime, which accumulated after herbivory in poplar leaves, decreased survival and weight gain of gypsy moth larvae in feeding experiments  <cit> . since in the present study volatile aliphatic and aromatic aldoximes, nitriles and nitro compounds and the semi volatile -phenylacetaldoxime were found to be emitted from or accumulated in the two investigated erythroxylum species after treatment with ja in the same order of magnitude as that previously reported for herbivore-damaged poplar leaves , these compounds might play similar roles in plant defence against natural erythroxylum herbivores such as eloria noyesi and eucleodora cocae, two caterpillar pests, or the leaf cutting ant acromyrmex spp.  <cit> .

using homology-based searches, four genes with similarity to cyp79s from other plants could be identified in e. coca and e. fischeri. cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> from e. fischeri and cyp79d <dig> from e. coca were significantly upregulated after ja treatment  and the encoded enzymes had broad substrate specificity . the kinetic parameters of cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> were in the range reported for those of previously characterized poplar cyp <dig> enzymes  <cit> . although the k
m values were relatively high, it has been suggested that the low substrate affinity of cyp <dig> enzymes has evolved to avoid possible depletion of free amino acid pools in plants  <cit> . considering both the k
m and maximal velocity values for the conversion of the different substrates , it is likely that cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> accept l-phenylalanine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-tryptophan as substrates in planta. moreover, the accumulation and emission of their aldoxime products after ja treatment  coupled with the ja-induced expression of their genes  indicate that cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> contribute to herbivore-induced aldoxime formation in e. coca and e. fischeri, respectively. the ja-induced production of aldoximes might be further promoted by the increased accumulation of the respective amino acid substrates in ja-treated leaves . since cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> are highly similar to each other  and showed no remarkable differences in in vitro assays , the kinetic parameters of cyp79d <dig> were not determined in this study. although it is likely that cyp79d <dig> has similar kinetic constants to cyp79d <dig>  the lower expression level of cyp79d <dig> in ja-treated leaves in comparison to cyp79d <dig> suggests only a minor role for this enzyme in aldoxime production in e. fischeri.

while cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig> are likely involved in plant defense, the biological function of cyp79d <dig> remains unclear. in contrast to the other three enzymes, cyp79d <dig> accepted exclusively l-tryptophan as substrate . the affinity of cyp79d <dig> for l-tryptophan was higher in comparison to cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig> ; however, the low relative product formation indicates a low turnover number for this enzyme. since gene expression was not influenced by ja treatment, it is unlikely that cyp79d <dig> contributes to herbivore-induced accumulation of -indole-3-acetaldoxime. in many plants, the conversion of -indole-3-acetaldoxime into the corresponding acid is thought to serve as an alternative route for the formation of auxin  and thus it is conceivable that cyp79d <dig> might produce -indole-3-acetaldoxime as precursor for constitutive auxin formation in leaves or other growing plant parts of e. coca. a comprehensive correlation between cyp79d <dig> gene expression and the accumulation of auxin in different plant organs and different developmental stages might help to elucidate the potential role of cyp79d <dig> in auxin formation.

as a result of domestication, many crop plants show altered levels of secondary compounds in comparison to their wild relatives  <cit> . e. coca, for example, has been cultivated for thousands of years and has been selected for high-level production of the pharmacologically active tropane alkaloid cocaine  <cit> . the cultivated species contains 20- <dig> times more cocaine in its leaves then closely related wild species  <cit> . while such selection for high-level production of useful compounds or for low-level production of undesired compounds is controlled by the breeder, domestication can also have unrecognized and unwanted side effects. the accumulation of an inactive allele of -β-caryophyllene synthase during breeding of north american maize, for instance, led to the loss of -β-caryophyllene production in most of these lines  <cit> . -β-caryophyllene is usually released as volatile from herbivore-damaged maize leaves and roots and has been shown to be involved in different indirect defence reactions above and below ground . in this study we showed that e. coca and e. fischeri accumulate and release the same aldoximes, nitriles, and nitro compounds after ja-treatment in comparable amounts, suggesting that domestication did not alter these plant defence responses in cultivated e. coca. whether the quantitative differences between other single compounds in the ja-induced volatile bouquets of e. coca and e. fischeri are species specific or are the result of the breeding of e. coca, is still unclear.

CONCLUSIONS
herbivore-induced volatile blends are in general very complex and contain dozens of substances. however, the enzymatic machinery behind this complexity is often astonishingly simple, comprising only a handful of enzymes with broad substrate and/or product specificity. terpene synthases, the key enzymes in terpene biosynthesis, for instance, can produce mixtures of up to  <dig> compounds from one substrate  <cit> . moreover, methyltransferases and acyltransferases involved in the formation of volatile esters have been reported to accept multiple substrates  <cit> . such promiscuity in the substrate and/or product specificity of volatile-producing enzymes seems to be a general phenomenon that allows plants to efficiently produce a large mixture of different volatiles with only a limited number of enzymes. mixtures may have specific advantages in plant defense  <cit> . recently we showed that two poplar cyp79s involved in volatile aldoxime formation also exhibit broad substrate specificity in contrast to all other previously described cyp79s  <cit> . the erythroxylum enzymes characterized in this study represent the second example for cyp79s having broad substrate specificity and it is thus tempting to speculate that such promiscuity might be a general feature for cyp79s forming herbivore-induced volatiles. however, further research on volatile aldoxime-producing cyp <dig> enzymes from diverse plant families is still needed to substantiate this assertion and to understand the evolutionary and structural causes of broad substrate specificity in this enzyme class.
