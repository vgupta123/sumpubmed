BACKGROUND
preserving homeostasis is the primary function of the innate immune system that detects “danger and stranger” signals and eliminates invading microorganisms, responds to irritation and injury and eventually initiates tissue repair. innate immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells constantly sample their environment for lipopolysaccharides , double and single-stranded nucleic acids, microbial proteins and other broad molecular patterns that are not normally present in eukaryotes and, in response, produce cytokines and chemokines that attract additional immune cells to the site of infection or injury. normally a protective response, excessive or persistent inflammation is associated with tissue damage and needs to be regulated. indeed, numerous mechanisms have evolved that control inflammation at multiple levels. systemically, inflammatory stimuli activate neuro-endocrine circuitry that triggers the production of glucocorticoids by the adrenal glands, which ultimately attenuate the expression of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . these potent anti-inflammatory properties made glucocorticoids exceedingly common for managing a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis  <cit> .

glucocorticoids signal through the glucocorticoid receptor  – a ubiquitously expressed ligand-dependent transcription factor  of the nuclear receptor  superfamily. gr regulates transcription by either binding directly to specific dna sequences known as glucocorticoid response elements  or by tethering to other dna-bound regulators, such as activator protein  <dig>  nuclear factor  κb and signal transducers and activators of transcription  family members  <cit> . although gr is expressed in all immune cells, the physiological outcomes of gr activation are highly cell type-specific: for example, glucocorticoids are anti-apoptotic in neutrophils, but pro-apoptotic in eosinophils, dendritic and some t-cells  <cit> . moreover, prolonged glucocorticoid treatment induces cells polarization toward a new phenotype with either pro- or anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> .

the analyses of glucocorticoid-regulated transcriptomes paint a complicated picture encompassing hundreds of up- and down-regulated genes that vary in different cell types and populations and over time of glucocorticoid exposure  <cit> . although shared gr target genes certainly exist, system-specific regulators and pathways drastically affect transcriptional outcomes, response dynamics and relative activities of such shared genes and their products. the existence of intricate inter-protein and inter-pathway interactions contributing to the nr-mediated gene regulation has been proposed almost 30 years ago  <cit> . the structural analysis of nr transcriptional networks, however, was lagging due to the lack of genome-wide data and limited availability of analytical tools. more recently, studies in bacteria and yeast have defined specific patterns of functional interactions  between interdependent tfs and provided a computational framework for the analysis of gene expression data to identify such motifs . the simplest motif - a positive or negative auto-regulatory loop - consists of a single tf that regulates its own expression. more complicated feed forward loops  involve three factors: a signal-responsive master regulator tf, an intermediate tf controlled by the master tf and a jointly regulated gene under the control of both the master and intermediate tfs  <cit> . depending on the specific activities of the master and intermediate tfs  and the response thresholds of participating genes, the dynamics of the ffl transcriptional outputs vary, yielding unique expression patterns for various tf and target gene combinations. dynamic responses elicited by ffls deviate from simple gene regulation providing for unusual control mechanisms that are responsible for noise filtering, fold-change sensing, pulse generation and transcription response acceleration  <cit> .

gene expression networks can be represented as graphs with tfs and other expression regulators acting as nodes and functional interactions between regulators and between regulators and their targets as directional edges  <cit> . of particular interest are the networks and network motifs in which tfs regulate each other, or themselves act as transcriptome organizers and ultimately determine the topology of the entire network  <cit> . several computational algorithms and experimental approaches have been successfully applied to map global transcriptional networks and identify novel functional motifs in various organisms  <cit> . in metazoans, this analysis is often complicated by the lack of information about the edge identity  and direction . to complicate matters further, the role of intermediate tfs can be fulfilled by mirnas or regulators of rna translation and stability  <cit> . thus, dissecting regulatory networks requires a combination of computational and experimental approaches.

we reasoned that a highly branched response to glucocorticoids is determined by the early transcriptional events. here, we focused on the regulatory network elicited by an acute stimulation of mouse macrophages with glucocorticoids and/or lps. combined with high-resolution kinetic experiments and dynamics modeling, this analysis enabled us to dissect early post-stimulation events prior to extensive signal propagation, which usually masks the bona fide response to gr activation by a web of secondary effects.

RESULTS
transcriptome analysis of mouse macrophages exposed to acute glucocorticoid and lps stimulation
to analyze early regulatory events initiated by glucocorticoids and inflammatory stimuli we treated bmmФ with either ethanol vehicle , lps , dex , or a combination of the two  for 1 h, isolated and sequenced polya-enriched rna as described in . the sequencing results are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

to uncover the regulatory patterns in gene expression data, we performed k-mean cluster analysis of anova-filtered differentially expressed genes . to minimize magnitude-based clustering, the log2-transformed expression values were first converted to z-scores as in  where xgene is an expression value for a given gene at a given condition,  is an average expression value across conditions and σ is a standard deviation of  across conditions. the optimal number of clusters was determined using the “elbow” method by plotting within-cluster variance vs. the number of clusters. the analysis was performed using euclidian distance with progressively increasing number of clusters from  <dig> to  <dig> to determine a stable configuration using the cluster analysis module of statistica  <dig> . we grouped anova-filtered data into  <dig> clusters of co-regulated genes . we further evaluated the significance of differences in gene expression within clusters by the mann–whitney test and validated the results for a limited number of genes by rt-qpcr. as many glucocorticoid- and lps-responsive genes have been previously characterized by us and others , we selected for validation either poorly characterized or novel target genes. based on patterns of co-regulation, we grouped these clusters into four larger categories .figure  <dig> 
dex- and lps-regulated genes in bmmФ form distinct clusters depending on specific patterns of expression. anova-filtered rna-seq expression values  were z score-transformed and subjected to k-mean clustering. for each cluster, the upper left panel shows the cluster average z score-transformed log <dig> rpkm for each treatment condition where the central square represents standardized cluster mean, the rectangle is the mean +/- standard deviation  and the whiskers are a 95% confidence interval; the upper right panel shows log-transformed raw cluster mean expression values. symbols representing treatment conditions are black - untreated , blue - dex-treated , pink - lps-treated  and purple - co-treated  cells. the expression of two representative genes per cluster were determined by rt-qpcr with gene-specific primers and shown at the bottom. the statistical significance of differences  is indicated by asterisks as following: * - p <  <dig> , ** - p <  <dig> , *** - p <  <dig>  and ns is non-significant.



i) genes activated by either lps  or glucocorticoids 
the majority of genes in these two clusters are upregulated by either lps or dex independently, with little evidence for inter-treatment interactions at 1 h. the lps-induced cluster  <dig>  contains genes encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , tfs involved in stress response  and proteins involved in tlr signaling  and signal transduction .

cluster  <dig> contains dex-induced genes , including several well-characterized gr targets such as tfs per <dig> and klf <dig>  immunophilin fkbp <dig>  potassium channel kcnk <dig>  in addition, this cluster includes several genes whose regulation by dex has not been previously reported: interleukin  <dig> receptor alpha , the wnt pathway receptor fzd <dig>  the tf klf <dig> and chemokine ccl <dig> 

ii) genes co-activated by lps and dex
these genes display either predominantly additive  or synergistic  activation by lps and dex. several genes in these clusters are previously characterized gr targets including dusp <dig>  nfil <dig> and cited <dig>  and mt <dig> and pfkfb <dig> , whereas the glucocorticoid and lps responsiveness of several others, such as histone chaperon jdp <dig> , has not been reported previously.

iii) genes induced by lps and repressed by dex
this large group of genes is represented by clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> contains lps-induced genes  expressed at relatively high level in resting bmmФ. the basal expression of these genes is significantly more sensitive to hormonal treatment  than their lps-induced expression. this cluster encompasses a number of inflammatory cytokines , tfs  and proteins involved in signal transduction . interestingly, several genes in this cluster  are characterized by the presence of the stalled rna pol ii near the transcription start site in uninduced conditions and are activated primarily at the level of the pol ii pause release during early elongation . cluster  <dig> combines a heterogeneous group of genes with low basal expression  that are strongly induced by lps and includes inflammatory cytokines  and other direct mediators of inflammation , tfs  and signaling molecules . cluster  <dig> contains many genes whose lps induction is strongly inhibited by dex treatment  =  <dig> ) including several cytokines and chemokines  and tfs .

cluster  <dig> contains statistically heterogeneous previously reported  as well as novel  targets for gr-mediated repression that are largely unaffected by lps treatment. thus, this cluster is formally outside of group iii.

iv) genes downregulated by lps
lps-repressed genes were separated into  <dig> clusters based on the combined effect of dex and lps on gene expression. the lps-mediated downregulation is either weakly potentiated  or antagonized  by dex. the functions of the majority of these genes are poorly understood or unknown, however, 32% of genes in cluster  <dig> and 20% in cluster  <dig> encode uncharacterized c2h <dig> zn-finger proteins implicated in transcription and chromosome maintenance.

expression of genes in cluster  <dig> is downregulated by dex and lps in an additive manner. at least one gene in this cluster  is a known gr target. several genes encode regulators of immune cells activities including rit <dig> and cd300lb. cluster  <dig> contains dex-induced genes that are weakly repressed by lps including previously reported ddit <dig>  arl4d and sik <dig> 

cluster validation by rt-qpcr
two representative genes in each cluster were chosen for validation. total rna was isolated from treated  and control bmmФ and transcript levels for indicated genes  were determined by rt-qpcr using act <dig> or hprt as housekeeping control genes. as several lps-induced, dex-repressed genes coding for various cytokines that we found in clusters  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  have been previously characterized by us and others , we focused on uncharacterized lps/dex targets. the expression patterns determined by rt-qpcr closely resembled those determined by rna-seq, with the exception of several weakly expressed genes that were not detectably repressed by dex following a 1-h treatment .

glucocorticoid-regulated genes form a highly interconnected association network with distinct response-specific modules
to determine the prevalent functional patterns in groups of co-regulated genes, we performed gene enrichment analysis and visualization using genemania plugin  <cit>  for cytoscape  <dig>  and exploratory gene association networks  software  <cit> .

using a list of genes that were up-  and down-  regulated by dex, we generated a consensus association network consisting of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. to discern underlying data structure in the dex-regulated network, we decomposed this network using the newman-girvan community clustering algorithm  <cit> , a divisive procedure that iteratively removes network edges with largest “edge betweenness”, recalculates this metric for a novel network and repeats the procedure until the network is split into several groups. the newman-girvan algorithm disregards edge weights and uses only connectivity to define communities. community clustering partitioned dex-regulated network into three unequal modules that were significantly enriched with dex-repressed genes , dex-induced genes  or lps-repressed genes .network topology analysis of dex-responsive modules revealed significantly greater network densities and clustering coefficients in modules  <dig> and  <dig> compared to networks generated from the same number of non-expressed genes extracted from the same bmmФ experiments . similarly, the average neighborhood connectivities and average clustering coefficients for modules  <dig> and  <dig> were considerably greater than the values for non-expressors , indicating that nodes in these modules form tight interconnected local groups. a broader shared neighbors distribution in modules  <dig> and  <dig> indicates high prevalence of shared nodes, suggesting an enrichment for multiple input motifs. interestingly, module  <dig>  was more structured than module  <dig>  as evidenced by consistently higher average neighborhood connectivities and average clustering coefficients . although module  <dig> has a non-random composition, with the exception of network heterogeneity, all other analyzed topological metrics were typical of networks composed of randomly selected non-expressed genes . therefore, we focused the rest of the analysis of modules  <dig> and  <dig>  relatively high heterogeneity for both modules  indicates the presence of network hubs - nodes with high degree of connectivity. indeed,  <dig> most connected nodes in modules  <dig> and  <dig> account for  <dig> and 32% of all edges, respectively . interestingly, eight out of  <dig> most connected nodes in module  <dig> are sequence-specific dna-binding tfs .figure  <dig>

participate in highly interconnected networks with tf control nodes.  ranked list of dex-responsive genes was used as an input for genemania network building algorithm. the resulting combined network was partitioned using the newman-girvan algorithm into three modules enriched with  dex-repressed,  dex-induced and  lps-repressed genes. to simplify the view, the edges representing co-expression, co-localization and shared protein domains were hidden. the size of the node is proportional to the node connectivity. the nodes are colored according to the magnitude of dex effect on respective gene expression using multicolorednode cytoscape plugin. the nodes predicted by genemania are colored gray. both  network-wide and  node-specific network topological parameters in modules  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrate high level of interconnectivity with a large number of shared nodes.  nodes with the highest degree of connectivity in the modules  <dig> and  <dig>  the genes coding for tfs are shown in bold.



glucocorticoid response-specific modules are functionally distinct
using gene ontology  analysis to determine enriched gene categories in subsets of functionally related genes, we identified  <dig> enriched go categories for module  <dig>   <dig> for module  <dig>  and  <dig> for module  <dig> . only  <dig> go categories overlapped between modules  <dig> and  <dig> . to facilitate visualization and interpretation of these results and compare enriched functional categories among groups of dex-regulated genes, we generated go terms similarity networks using gene set enrichment mapping cytoscape plug-in. multiple go categories related to regulation of metabolic processes, embryonic and post-embryonic development and regulation of apoptosis and signaling are enriched in module  <dig>  that contains a large number of dex-upregulated genes. notably, 32/ <dig> go categories enriched in module  <dig> were related to regulation of gene expression, regulation of transcription, sequence-specific dna binding transcription factors. for example, negative regulation of gene expression , negative regulation of transcription , negative regulation of transcription - dna-dependent , sequence-specific dna binding , negative regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter  and transcription regulator activity  were all enriched in module  <dig>  but not module  <dig> . overrepresentation of genes coding for regulators of gene expression in the early dex-responsive transcriptome suggests that gr initiates a transcriptional program that relies on the step-wise activation of multiple tfs. only a few categories related to immune/inflammatory responses have been found in module  <dig> .figure  <dig>

Ф
. go categories enriched among dex-regulated genes in modules  <dig>  and  <dig>   were used to create go terms similarity networks where the nodes represent go gene sets and the edge length between two nodes is proportional to the fraction of shared genes in categories. individual clusters were manually repositioned to simplify network layout and colored as indicated; the broad top go terms are colored grey. the word tags were generated with wordtag cytoscape plugin  <cit>  to represent frequency-based semantic summary of words in go category titles found in individual clusters and the size of the nodes is proportional to the number of genes in the respective go gene set.  go enrichment analysis of individual go categories in modules  <dig> and  <dig> relative to the mouse genome. the fdr-corrected p-values  are shown for each bar.



conversely, the majority of enriched go categories in module  <dig>  which contains predominantly dex-repressed genes, are related to immune and inflammatory responses, signaling and regulation of signal transduction and metabolic regulation including immune response , immune system process , inflammatory response  and regulation of cytokine production  . the fraction of gene expression-related go categories in this module is significantly smaller  than in module  <dig> 

dex-responsive transcription regulators
we identified  <dig> dex-responsive genes whose products are involved in the regulation of gene expression .  <dig> of these genes including tfs klf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  per <dig>  jdp <dig>  cited <dig>  nfil <dig> and tiparp are upregulated by dex;  <dig> others including tfs junb, atf <dig>  tgif <dig>  irf <dig> and bcl <dig> are downregulated; for  <dig> regulatory proteins , the inhibitory effect of dex is apparent only in lps-induced mФ. for all dex-induced and a subset of dex-repressed tfs, we have independently confirmed rna-seq data by rt-qpcr .to uncover potential functional interactions between dex-regulated tfs, we treated bmmФ with dex for up to 9 h and determined expression levels of a subset of dex-regulated genes by rt-qpcr. we observed a striking difference in expression patterns over time. nfil <dig>  cited <dig>  jdp <dig> and per <dig>  are characterized by an accelerated burst phase, with the mrna level reaching maximum within 30–60 min and then remaining constant  or slowly declining over time . klf <dig>  klf <dig>  tsc22d <dig> and ddit <dig> are strongly induced within the first 2 h, and their rna levels continue to increase for the next 6 h . the expression profile of fkbp <dig> exhibits an initial delay, followed by a robust and sustained induction . conversely, klf <dig> and tiparp displayed pulse-like rapid upregulation within 1–3 h followed by a decline in transcript level, which in the case of klf <dig> reaches baseline ; a similar biphasic pattern of expression was observed for tgfb <dig>  il15ra and mt <dig> . interestingly, bcl <dig>  junb and tgif <dig> responded with rapid pulse-like downregulation followed by a slow return to basal expression level, whereas atf <dig> was rapidly downregulated within the first hour and remained repressed throughout the time course . unexpectedly, the pparg expression was only modestly induced by dex at the early time points, then decreased dramatically by 3 h and remained low for up to 9 h .figure  <dig> 
dex-responsive regulators of gene expression.

the dynamics of hormone-responsive gene expression is consistent with ffl network motifs.  bmmФ were treated with  <dig> nm dex for indicated time and the expression levels of dex-responsive genes were determined by rt-qpcr.  bmmФ were treated with dex either alone or in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor chx for 1–3 h; the expression of indicated genes were determined by rt-qpcr and expressed relative to transcript levels in the absence of dex , with or without chx .  the dynamics of klf <dig> expression is consistent with the i1-ffl with a strong repressor  as an intermediate regulator. klf <dig> expression data  collected over 9 h was subjected to a global least square analysis  using the equation  . the quality of the fit as determined by calculating coefficient of determination r <dig>  improved considerably when the expression data were limited to initial 4 h . the numerical solution of the equation , which allows for variation in degradation rates of both “r” and klf <dig>  yields a better fit  to the klf <dig> expression data. the r <dig> for curve fitting analyses are shown in the legend.  glucocorticoid induction of klf <dig> in bmmФ derived from klf9-ko mice  loses peak-like kinetics, characteristic of i1-ffl controlled genes . wt and klf9-ko bmmФ were cultured in the presence of dex for indicated time and the expression of klf <dig>  tsc22d <dig> and nr3c <dig>  was assessed by rt-qpcr as in a. basal levels of each transcript were set to  <dig> for untreated bmmФ of each genotype. error bars are standard errors of the mean.



the dynamics of expression for several dex-regulated tfs suggests that they are under combinatorial controls that involve gr and additional gr targets which either cooperate with or antagonize gr actions. as such a model implies transcription/protein production of these putative gr targets, we first examined the expression of dex-regulated genes in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . treatment with chx up for to 3 h had no dramatic effects on dex-mediated regulation of klf <dig>  tcs22d <dig>  tgfb <dig> and bcl <dig> , suggesting a direct regulation by gr that does not rely on synthesis of additional proteins. conversely, the expression of atf <dig> became refractory to dex in the presence of chx  suggesting that additional proteins induced by dex rather than gr itself are likely to directly regulate this gene. for several dex-responsive genes , however, treatment with chx dramatically upregulated their basal expression, complicating the assessment of the relative contribution of direct vs. indirect effects of gr to their regulation  and necessitating an alternative approach.

temporal dynamics of hormone-regulated gene expression is consistent with feed forward logic
the dynamics of the transcriptional response of several genes to dex imply the existence of some feedback mechanism that limits activation by gr yet, at the same time, is gr-dependent. because chx elicits many off-target effects and does not enable us to discriminate between the secondary targets of gr and those jointly controlled by gr and a gr-regulated tf, we performed dynamic modeling of expression data in an attempt to discern specific regulatory patterns. several mechanisms including positive and negative autoregulation, positive and negative feedback and feed forward loops  could account for deviations from a simple model with a single tf regulating gene expression via a single dna binding site  <cit> . the kinetics of gr expression following dex stimulation is not consistent with auto-regulatory models . depending on the overall regulatory outputs and activities of individual ffl components, two types of ffl have been recognized – coherent  and incoherent . in type  <dig> i-ffl , the activating master tf and a repressing intermediate regulator have opposite effect on a jointly regulated gene. dynamic modeling and experimental studies of i1-ffl dynamics have demonstrated several properties of this network motif, including its ability to produce sharp pulse-like activation of a jointly regulated gene with a fast relaxation time  <cit> . several gr-regulated genes, including klf <dig>  tiparp, tgfb <dig>  mt <dig> exhibit pulse-like kinetics at constant dex exposure . near-baseline relaxation of klf <dig> expression suggests that this gene is under control of both gr and a strong dex-induced repressor. because gr is largely inactive in the absence of ligand, glucocorticoids act as a low-latency on-off switch eliminating the need to correct for a baseline activity of gr. the dynamics of klf <dig> and repressor  expression is described by the ordinary differential equations  and    <cit> .

assuming equal degradation rates of klf <dig> and r, these equations can be solved analytically  and  <cit> ) and used to fit the expression data for klf <dig>  when limited to the early data points , the expression data fit very well to the predicted expression pattern , however, at the later time, when the contribution of degradation rates becomes significant, the quality of fit decreases . using parameter estimates derived from equation  fitting, we solved equations  and  numerically. figure 5c shows a good concordance between the experimental data for klf <dig> expression as determined by rt-qpcr and the numerical solution  that describes the dynamics of the i1-ffl. this result strongly suggests that klf <dig> and, potentially, several other gr targets that exhibit similar expression dynamics  are jointly regulated by gr and a gr-induced repressor via the i1-ffl network motifs.

numerical solutions of equations  <dig> and  <dig> also provide a theoretical prediction of an intermediate repressor dynamics in the gr-r-klf <dig> i-ffl. interestingly, among several known transcription repressors activated by gr, the expression kinetics of klf <dig> fits the best to the predicted model . the dynamics of the gr-r-klf <dig> ffl can be tested by perturbing the concentration of a hypothetical intermediate repressor which should uncouple the ffl thus shifting peak-like ffl-mediated kinetics to simple monotonous kinetics eventually converging to a steady-state level. to test the role of klf <dig> as a potential gr-activated repressor of klf <dig> transcription, we derived m from klf9-ko mice  <cit>  kindly provided by dr. simmen and treated them with  <dig> nm dex as above. interestingly, in klf <dig> null bmmФ the peak-like klf <dig> induction profile “degenerated” to monotonous activation kinetics that plateaued at a steady state level by 3 h , replicating the profiles of previously reported uncoupled experimental i-ffls  <cit> , consistent with the proposed role of klf <dig> as an intermediate repressor in the gr-klf9-klf <dig> i-ffl. at the same time, deletion of klf <dig> did not affect the expression dynamics of either gr itself or the gr target gene tsc22d <dig> with a simple monotonous activation profile .

gr is recruited to binding sites associated with dex-regulated genes
the ffl gene regulatory circuitry predicts that the master tf binds dna to regulate transcription of both ffl nodes. using several published mouse chip-seq datasets of acute gr recruitment  <cit>  we interrogated dex-induced genes for the presence of gr binding sites within the gene and  <dig> kb upstream and downstream of the gene. with the exception of sox <dig> and klf <dig>  all genes encoding dex-induced tfs contained at least one peak within the analyzed intervals . to compare these peaks to those in mФ, we analyzed gr recruitment by chip-seq using untreated mФ as a control and identified  <dig>  peaks induced by a 40-min dex exposure at 2% fdr. selective comparison of binding site distributions revealed a high level of concordance between dex-induced peaks in mФ and those previously described in adipocytes  <cit>   and a partial overlap with a gr cistrome in mФ polarized with high dose long-term glucocorticoid exposure  <cit> . by chip-qpcr, we detected gr recruitment as early as 40 min post dex treatment at multiple putative gr binding sites, including those at per <dig>  cited <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  nfil <dig>  jdp <dig>  tiparp and ncoa <dig> . these observations correlate well with the expression data . although klf <dig> was strongly induced by dex, no glucocorticoid response elements  near the gene has been previously reported. we performed a scanning chip with evenly spaced primers within the klf <dig> gene and several primers flanking potential gr binding sites . two of the putative gres located at -3830 bp  and +5896 bp  relative to the klf <dig> transcription start site recruited gr following a 40-min treatment with dex , consistent with the notion that, similar to genes shown in figure 6b, gr is likely to regulate klf <dig> directly.figure  <dig> 
gr binds genomic sites associated with genes encoding dex-induced tfs.  chip-seq data from bmmФ , adipocytes  and c2c <dig> cells  reveal multiple dex-dependent gr binding peaks associated with dex-induced genes encoding tfs. the numbers under the putative gr binding sites indicate primer pairs used in chip-qpcr experiments in bmmФ .  chip-qpcr-assessed gr occupancy at putative gr binding sites indicated in  prior  and upon  a 40-min stimulation with  <dig> nm dex.  scanning chip of the klf <dig> genomic region reveals a putative gr binding site. primer positions and amplified products are shown as black rectangles over the gene schematics. putative sites harboring sequences similar to gr binding sites are labeled as gre <dig> , <dig> with the binding sequence shown on top. the capital letters indicate nucleotides fitting a consensus gre. a green rectangle overlapping the klf <dig> tss indicates the position of a klf <dig> binding site identified in  <cit> . data for each site represent average of  <dig> or more independent experiments; error bars are standard deviation.
the distribution of gr, klf and pparγ binding sites at dex/lps-responsive genes in bmmФ.  for each expression cluster , the frequencies of genes with binding sites for at least one of the tf  within the region encompassing the gene and  <dig> kb of flanking sequences on each side  was compared to those in random group of non-expressors , low expressors  and all expressing genes  in bmmФ.  a select group of dex-responsive genes contains clusters of gr , crosshatched - adipocytes  <cit> , red - c2c <dig> cells  <cit> ), klf <dig>  and pparγ  binding sites.



we then used a set of dex/lps-regulated genes to analyze the distribution and enrichment of binding sites for tfs that were present in chip-enrichment analysis  database  <cit> . the chea database contains curated published genome-wide datasets of tf binding sites in human, mouse and rat. after filtering out tfs that were not expressed in mФ , we noted that binding sites for several dex-responsive tfs, such as klf <dig>  klf <dig>  atf <dig>  egr <dig>  cebpβ and irf <dig> are enriched among dex/lps-regulated genes. interestingly, binding sites for pparγ, whose expression was inhibited upon prolonged dex treatment, were found near the majority  of dex-responsive gene expression regulators  and highly enriched among dex/lps-regulated genes in general.

we then determined the frequency of genes associated with binding sites for several tfs identified by chea and induced by dex in individual clusters of dex/lps-regulated genes . we defined a binding site as ‘gene-associated’ if its genomic intervals overlapped with genomic intervals encompassing all mouse genes annotated in mm <dig> +/-  <dig> kb by at least one nucleotide. in good correlation with the rna-seq data, acute gr recruitment peaks previously identified by chip-seq in dex-treated adipocytes  <cit>  were enriched in dex-induced clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . among dex-regulated tfs, mouse genome-wide binding datasets are currently available for klf <dig> , klf <dig> , pparγ  and nfil <dig>  . although klf <dig> sites are enriched in the entire dex/lps dataset compared to non-expressing genes, only in cluster  <dig>  the enrichment level attains significance . conversely, klf <dig> binding sites are underrepresented in the lps-induced cluster  <dig>  although the klf <dig> chip-on-chip dataset available was relatively small, several klf <dig> targets were regulated by dex and contained gr binding sites, including klf <dig> itself, klf <dig>  klf <dig> and tgfb <dig>  <cit> .

two mouse pparγ datasets, one from differentiated adipocytes and one from resting mФ are currently available  <cit> . consistent with the previously reported role of pparγ in repression of inflammatory genes, pparγ binding sites are overrepresented in several lps-induced clusters  in both datasets. in addition, in the mФ dataset, pparγ binding sites were enriched in dex-induced and -repressed clusters,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

the only available genome-wide dataset of nfil <dig> binding was acquired in a neuronal cell line  <cit> . among nfil3-occupied genes identified in that study, only four genes overlap with dex/lps-regulated dataset reported here; however, one of them, tsc22d <dig> , is a well-characterized gr target.to identify genes that might be under combinatorial control by gr and another dex-responsive tf, we searched for loci that contained gr, klf and/or pparγ binding sites located close to each other within a gene +/-  <dig> kb. intriguingly, several gr targets including klf <dig>  klf <dig>  cited <dig> and mt <dig> contained tight clusters of binding sites for gr, klf and pparγ  suggesting that these tfs may interact functionally or physically at a subset of gr-regulated genes.

lps downregulates a unique class of genes encoding the c2h2-krab gene expression regulators
even a brief lps treatment results in a marked downregulation of a large number of genes confined to clusters 10– <dig>  go overrepresentation analysis of lps-repressed genes revealed that many of them participate in the regulation of nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression and transcription however, detailed information on specific functions of many of these proteins is lacking. interestingly,  <dig> proteins in these clusters contained tandem zinc-finger motifs . we confirmed that the expression of  <dig> of these zn-finger proteins is rapidly downregulated by lps in mФ, and remains suppressed for up to 6 h of treatment . further analysis of domain architecture revealed that in the majority of these proteins, tandem zn-fingers co-occur with domains such as kruppel-associated box , btb  and scan . krab is a tetrapoda-specific domain that defines one of the largest sub-families of zn-finger proteins  <cit>  which are involved in nucleic acid binding and regulation of gene expression. although the specific functions of the majority of krab proteins with respect to innate immunity are not well studied, in a few characterized cases krab proteins have been associated with transcriptional repression, establishing reversible patterns of histone and dna methylation and reversible heterochromatization .figure  <dig> 
many lps-downregulated genes encode zn-finger proteins containing krab domains.  domain overrepresentation analysis among lps-suppressed genes  revealed a large number of zn-finger proteins  that, in addition, contain krab, scan and btb domains. the list of lps-downregulated zn-finger proteins is shown with krab, scan and btb domains indicated as red, blue and green boxes, respectively.  the kinetics of lps-mediated suppression of select genes encoding zn-finger krab domain-containing proteins. bmmФ were treated with lps for indicated time and the expression of indicated genes was assessed by rt-qpcr.

gr is a ubiquitous ligand-dependent tf capable of eliciting highly divergent transcription programs with up to a third of protein-coding genes differentially expressed following a 24-h glucocorticoid treatment  <cit> . establishing the hierarchy of regulatory events upon prolonged hormonal exposure in individual cell types is challenging, which complicates both accurate mechanistic predictions and clinical decisions. multiple gr ligands have been designed in an attempt to create a highly specific compound that selectively regulates desired subsets of genes. mechanistic analyses of these ligands usually focus on a specific group of disease-relevant genes and often involve long-term treatments, which obscure primary and transient responses to gr activation by a plethora of secondary pathways. in the context of inflammation, both immediate and delayed regulatory events are clinically relevant as they reflect typical glucocorticoid treatment modalities. we reasoned that by analyzing early transcriptomes elicited by the inflammatory and glucocorticoid exposure in mФ, a clinically relevant cell type, we will be able to isolate a key set of immediate gr targets responsible for the delayed gene expression patterns. our results indicate that early glucocorticoid- and lps-dependent changes establish a highly organized program of gene expression with distinct groups of genes following cooperative and antagonistic regulation. as expected from previous work  <cit>  a large group of lps-induced genes that included among others inflammatory cytokines, was rapidly downregulated by glucocorticoids. another group encompassing glucocorticoid-induced genes, some of which encode tfs  or signaling proteins , are involved in curbing inflammatory signaling  <cit> . we identified several previously unreported glucocorticoid-induced genes whose products are involved in signaling , regulation of transcription  and mrna stability . several of these genes add to the arsenal of anti-inflammatory mediators regulated by gr. for example, klf <dig> interferes with ap1- and nfκb-mediated transcription of tnf and several chemokines including ccl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, klf <dig> haploinsufficiency in mice results in an exaggerated inflammatory response and more severe disease in arthritis models  <cit> . ccl <dig>  another previously unreported glucocorticoid-induced chemokine, is a marker and promoter of the polarization of ‘alternatively activated’ m <dig> mФ, which are considered anti-inflammatory and mediate tissue repair and wound healing  <cit> . in addition to repressing cytokine gene transcription, glucocorticoids downregulate expression of several tfs including atf <dig>  junb, irf <dig>  bcl <dig>  tgif <dig>  some  in the context of lps induction, and, unexpectedly, pparg an enrichment in positive regulators of inflammation and cell proliferation among dex-downregulated tfs is consistent with the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects of glucocorticoids. the role of gr in repression of the pparg gene in mФ has not been previously reported, the effect might be indirect and mediated by a well-established gr target gilz  <cit> , which may also account for the delay . finally, we described a previously overlooked group of lps-downregulated genes encoding proteins with the c2h <dig> zinc-fingers adjacent to the krab domain. despite being one of the largest tf family, krab proteins remain poorly characterized. among those whose functions were described, several are involved in transcriptional regulation, rna and dna binding and splicing . krab domains interact with a scaffolding co-repressor trim <dig>  which in turn binds the heterochromatin protein  <dig>  chromatin remodeler mi2a and h3k9-specific methyltransferase  <cit> . indeed, some krab proteins reportedly repress transcription by heterochromatin spreading  <cit> . interestingly, several krab proteins have been linked to nr actions  <cit> . the role of krab proteins in inflammation is essentially unknown; however, genomic studies indicate that inflammatory signaling increases accessibility of large sections of the genome  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that a broad downregulation of proteins involved in heterochromatin maintenance and spreading serves to increase dna accessibility and inflammatory gene transcription.

the dynamic response to gr activation is consistent with feed forward logic
functional relationships between gr and its targets are often classified as “direct”, that involve gr recruitment to genomic binding sites associated with regulated genes, and “indirect”, whereby primary gr-regulated factors, rather than gr itself, are responsible for activation of the downstream targets. thus, the activation of these secondary targets is often described as sequential or delayed. such a model, however, cannot explain many instances of non-monotonous expression dynamics  and non-linear response to varying hormone concentration of many gre-driven genes  <cit> . the large number of shared neighbors, overrepresentation of tfs and their high interconnectivity in gr regulatory networks  are consistent with more intricate regulatory modalities such as ffl. variations in kinetic parameters for participating tfs, target gene structure and activation/repression thresholds often lead to paradoxical responses to stimulation of the master tf with profound functional implications. c-ffls serve as delayed response organizers that detect the duration/strength of a signal that activates the initiating tf  <cit> . interestingly, the dynamics of fkbp <dig> induction by dex, characterized by a substantial post-exposure delay followed by a robust expression , is reminiscent of the c-ffl in which the jointly regulated gene is activated by both the master and intermediate tfs  <cit> . although additional experiments are required to establish the precise mode of fkbp <dig> regulation, this gene is a known direct gr target that recruits gr to several gres .

incoherent loops are responsible for negative and positive pulse generation, accelerated response and fold change sensing  <cit> . here, we observed that several gr target genes exhibit both positive  and negative  pulse-like dynamics consistent with the i-ffl. in keeping with the role of a potential master regulator, gr binds to the gres in regulatory regions of many of these genes . furthermore, using a system of ordinary differential equations which describe ffls in the “fold sensors” model  <cit> , we showed that klf <dig> expression is consistent with that of a gene under joint control of gr and a strong gr-activated repressor . several gr-activated genes are either known transcription repressors  or may downregulate gene expression by destabilizing rna transcripts . curiously, the expression dynamics of klf <dig> fits closely with the computational prediction of an intermediate repressor in the gr-r-klf <dig> i-ffl . gr is recruited to the klf <dig> and klf <dig> gres as early as 40 min of dex treatment. both klf <dig> and klf <dig> regulatory regions also contain functional gaggcgtgg klf sites  which can be occupied by various tfs of the klf family  <cit>  including klf <dig>  finally, in klf9-ko macrophages, the induction profile of klf <dig> loses the early peak followed by a decrease and acquires monotonous kinetics  strongly suggesting a collapse of the i1-ffl to simple gr-dependent activation. interestingly, klf binding sites are overrepresented in glucocorticoid-regulated genes and are located near gres in several bona fide gr target genes suggesting that these factors may co-regulate a number of gr targets.

klf proteins in inflammation
both klf <dig> and klf <dig> have been implicated in myeloid cell biology. klf <dig> inhibits monocyte activation by inhibiting nfκb activity, which correlates with decreased expression of multiple cytokines and hif1α, a tf that regulates myeloid cell response to bacterial infection and reactive oxygen species  <cit> . consistent with the anti-inflammatory role of klf <dig>  mice hemizygous for klf <dig> have elevated levels of inflammatory mediators, such as ccl <dig> and ptgs <dig> . by extension, in klf2-deficient mice, the manifestations of both me-bsa- and il1β-experimentally induced inflammatory arthritis are more severe  <cit> .

klf <dig> is involved in inflammatory monocyte differentiation  <cit>  and in mФ polarization toward the m <dig> anti-inflammatory phenotype  <cit> . klf <dig> can act as either a transcriptional activator or a repressor  <cit> , however its role, if any, in inflammation has not been described. we showed here that gr regulates klf genes with distinct temporal dynamics and proposed that klf <dig> may act as a gr-induced klf <dig> repressor. thus, it is tempting to speculate that gr anti-inflammatory activities rely in part on the activation of klf genes whose products regulate transcription of additional targets in concert with gr. indeed, glucocorticoids and klf <dig> regulate partially overlapping set of genes during epidermal barrier establishment in embryogenesis  <cit> . the proximity of the gres and klf binding sites in the genome suggests an intriguing possibility that gr and klfs interact functionally or physically. curiously, a functional interaction with the i-ffl logic has been reported for gr and another member of klf family, klf <dig>  <cit> . although klf <dig> is not expressed in mФ, our studies strongly suggest extensive crosstalk between gr and other klf family members in the innate immune cells.

CONCLUSIONS
anti-inflammatory activities of glucocorticoids involve downregulation of inflammatory mediators and activation of various anti-inflammatory genes. the early glucocorticoid-driven transcriptome in mФ contains an unusually large number of genes coding for transcriptional regulators. temporal dynamics of hormone-regulated gene expression is consistent with feed forward logic suggesting that gr and gr-induced tfs jointly regulate gr target genes. in particular, our data suggest that gr is rapidly recruited to and activates genes encoding several members of the klf family of tfs with profound anti-inflammatory activities, such as klf <dig> and klf <dig>  furthermore, gr appears to regulate klf <dig> expression via the gr-klf9-flf <dig> i1-ffl. we propose that by acting as a hub for highly branched regulatory networks and activating genes encoding tfs to propagate the initial signal, gr coordinates anti-inflammatory responses.
