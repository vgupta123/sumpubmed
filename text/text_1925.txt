BACKGROUND
carotenoids are naturally occurring organic pigments produced by plants mainly as integral component of the light capturing and protective plastidal apparatus  <cit> . carotenoid intake plays an important role in human nutrition and health owing to the association of their consumption levels with reduced risk of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and age-related sight problems arising from deficiencies of lutein and zeaxantine  <cit> . provitamin a carotenoids including α-carotene, β-carotene and β-cryptozanthine are precursors of vitamin a, a micronutrient essential for normal development and functioning of the human body  <cit> . vitamin a deficiency is currently a global public health problem inflicting morbidity, stunted growth, night blindness and loss of both sight and lives in the developing world  <cit> . vitamin a deficiency is estimated to affect  <dig> million preschool children and  <dig> million pregnant and/or lactating women world wide  <cit> , which aggravates poverty and underdevelopment challenges in developing countries  <cit> .

maize can naturally accumulate both provitamin a and non-provitamin a carotenoids in its kernel, and is known for its genetic diversity of carotenoid content and profiles  <cit> . however, provitamin a usually constitutes only  <dig> to 20% of the total carotenoids in maize kernel, and the commonly cultivated and consumed yellow maize cultivars have less than 2 μg g- <dig> dw provitamin a  <cit> . exploitation of the natural genetic diversity of maize in carotenoids through biofortification by combining conventional and molecular breeding can increase provitamin a concentration in maize endosperm  <cit> . such increases in provitamin a concentration can be beneficial for public health in africa where maize is a major security and staple crop for more than  <dig> million people  <cit> . biofortification offers a safe, effective, cheap and sustainable approach to combating vitamin a and other micronutrient deficiencies  <cit> .

one of the major challenges in maize breeding for high provitamin a levels is the quantification of carotenoids in the endosperm of large number of breeding lines. high performance liquid chromatography  is the commonly used method for carotenoids analysis because of its accuracy. however, hplc is expensive, time consuming and relatively low throughput, limiting its use for routine breeding within resource-limited plant breeding programs  <cit> . even though the variation in intensity of yellow color in maize endosperm is attributable to the variations in carotenoid content and profile, selection for high provitamin a maize based on kernel color is not reliable due to its poor correlations with provitamin a content  <cit> . marker assisted selection  <cit>  using functional dna markers  <cit>  offers an effective tool for screening a large number of breeding materials for their carotenoid profile and content accurately and cheaply within a reasonable timeframe within a plant breeding program.

the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is well studied in plants  <cit> , where the genes encoding the enzymes of the biosynthesis pathway are known  <cit> . specific nucleotide sequence variants within the key carotenogenic genes have also been characterized, and shown to contribute significantly to accumulation of provitamin a and total carotenoids in maize endosperm  <cit> . for instance,  <cit>  showed that four polymorphic sites in the gene encoding lycopene epsilon cyclase  were associated with the variation in ratio of carotenoids in the α to β branches of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, leading to a threefold increase in provitamin a.  <cit>  also identified three polymorphic sites in another downstream gene encoding a β-carotene hydroxylase enzyme  accounting for 40% of the observed variation in β-carotene concentration in maize endosperm. two polymorphisms in the gene encoding phytoene synthase  have been identified explaining  <dig> to 8% of the variation in total carotenoids  <cit> . these findings allowed the development of breeder friendly pcr based functional dna markers that can be used as tools for detecting alleles representing each of the polymorphic sites in the three genes.

while these functional dna markers can be used to facilitate the development of maize cultivars fortified with high provitamin a, their efficacy in breeding lines used for maize variety delivery to sub-saharan africa has not been fully elucidated. some studies have examined the individual and combined effects of the functional polymorphisms of lcye and crtrb <dig> on carotenoids  <cit> . it has been observed that the proposed diagnostic polymorphisms for lcye could not distinguish between inbred lines with high lutein and high zeaxanthine, representing carotenoids in the α- and β-branches of the pathway, respectively  <cit> . inbred lines having high β-carotene contents have been identified, although they were carrying the unfavourable alleles of crtrb1-5′te and -3′te. similar inconsistencies for the favourable allele of the crtrb1-3′te marker have been observed  <cit> . a recent study tested two of the three significant polymorphic sites of lcye  and one of the three functional polymorphisms of crtrb <dig>  using  <dig> tropical segregating populations  <cit> . their results showed that the effects of lcye on both ratio of α to β branch carotenoids and total provitamin a content were inconsistent across the populations, whereas the crtrb1-3′te polymorphic site had a large effect on β-carotene and provitamin a concentrations. in contrast, significant effects have been detected for all the functional polymorphisms for individual and haplotypes of selected polymorphisms of lcye, crtrb <dig> and psy <dig>  using inbred lines with tropical, subtropical and temperate backgrounds  <cit> . the reported inconsistencies in the effects of the diagnostic dna markers for the proposed favourable alleles of lcye and crtrb <dig> require further investigation of these markers using diverse inbred lines to identify the most robust and effective markers for marker assisted selection.

in the present study, the functional dna markers for lcye, crtrb <dig> and psy <dig> were tested on a set of diverse tropical inbred lines with mixed genetic backgrounds of tropical and temperate origin developed within the international institute for tropical agriculture  maize breeding program for africa. the inbred lines were first evaluated for carotenoid content and composition across two seasons  and exhibited contrasting variations. two of the functional markers of crtrb <dig>  were found to be in high linkage disequilibrium, and displayed consistent and strong effect on the provitamin a carotenoid contents of the inbred lines. the deployment of these functional dna markers can accelerate the biofortification of tropical-adapted maize varieties with elevated levels of provitamin a.

methods
plant materials
one hundred and thirty diverse tropical adapted yellow maize inbred lines were assayed for carotenoid profiles and content and used in this marker-trait association study. these inbred lines were developed within the maize breeding program for africa at the international institute for tropical agriculture  from eight bi-parental crosses of tropical inbred lines, four broad based populations, and  <dig> backcrosses involving temperate lines as donors of high β-carotene .

field evaluation
the  <dig> inbred maize lines were field evaluated at iita’s research site  in ibadan, nigeria, in  <dig> and  <dig>  the field trial was arranged in a  <dig> ×  <dig> alpha-lattice design with two replications. each inbred line was planted in a single 5 m long row with spacing of  <dig>  m between rows and  <dig>  m between plants within a row. different fields were used in each season. fertilizer and field management practices recommended for optimum maize production were used. seed samples for carotenoid analyses were produced by self pollination of at least  <dig> representative plants in each row. self-pollinated ears in each row were harvested, dried under ambient temperature, and threshed, with minimal exposure to direct sunlight. one hundred kernels were drawn from seed samples for carotenoid analysis.

carotenoid analysis
carotenoids were extracted from the maize kernels and quantified by hplc at the university of wisconsin, usa. the extraction protocol and carotenoid analysis used was the method described in  <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  g finely ground sample of each entry was transferred into a 50 ml glass centrifuge tube to which 6 ml of ethanol plus  <dig> % butylated hydroxyl toluene were added, vortexed for  <dig> seconds, and incubated in 85°c water bath for 5 min. 500 μl of 80% potassium hydroxide  was added to each sample, vortexed for  <dig> seconds, and incubated in the 85°c water bath for 10 min with vortexing at about 5 min interval. samples were then immediately placed on ice and 3 ml ice cold deionized water added to each of them, vortexed for  <dig> seconds, and 200 μl internal standard β-apo-8′-carotenal and 4 ml hexane added. after vortexing and centrifugation, the top hexane layer formed was transferred into a new test tube. the hexane extraction was repeated twice, adding 3 ml hexane each time. samples were allowed to dry down completely under nitrogen gas using a turbovap lv concentrator  and reconstituted in 500 μl of 50: <dig> methanol:dichloroethane.

fifty micro-liter aliquots of each extract were injected into an hplc system . the water’s hplc components was operated with empower  <dig> software and included a  <dig> plus auto sampler with temperature control set at 5°c, waters  <dig> binary hplc pump, and a  <dig> photodiode array detector for carotenoid quantification. carotenoids were separated by c <dig> carotenoid column  eluted by a mobile phase gradient from 100% methanol/water  with 10 mm ammonium acetate to 50% methyl tertiary butyl ether. the flow rate was  <dig>  ml/min and the solvents were hplc grade. to maximize detection of carotenoids, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. alpha-carotene, β-carotene , β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin were quantified.

total carotenoid was calculated as the sum of concentrations of α-carotene, lutein, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthine and zeaxanthine. provitamin a was calculated as the sum of β-carotene and half of each of β-cryptoxanthin and α-carotene concentrations, since the latter two contribute 50% of the value of β-carotene as provitamin a  <cit> . other derived carotenoid traits were also calculated as indicated in  <cit>  and  <cit> , namely the ratio of carotenoids in β to α branch of the carotenoid pathway, the ratio of β-carotene to β-cryptoxanthine and the ratio of β-carotene to total carotenoids. the natural logarithms of the ratios were calculated to allow statistical analysis of the data, as the ratios followed a highly non-normal distribution. all concentrations were described in μg g- <dig> dry weight .

pcr based genotyping
for pcr based genotyping of the functional dna markers, leaf samples were collected from  <dig> to  <dig> randomly selected plants of each inbred line within one of the replications of the field trial described above at  <dig> days after planting. dna samples were isolated from freeze dried leaf samples of each genotype using either a ctab  based dna extraction protocol or qiagen dneasy® plant mini kit  following the company’s protocol.

pcr based functional markers of three genes lcye, crtrb <dig> and psy <dig> were deployed across all the  <dig> inbred lines. pcr conditions, cycling profiles and primers used were based on those reported by  <cit>  for lcye  <cit> , for crtrb <dig> and  <cit>  for psy <dig>  the primers used to amplify the lcye-3′te indel marker were forward 5′-acccgtacgtcgttcatctc-3′ and reverse 5′-accctgcgtggtctcaac-3′  <cit> . primer oligos were obtained from integrated dna technology inc . all pcrs were run using biotaq™ dna polymerase kit  with a mixture composed of 2 μl 10x nh <dig> pcr buffer, 1 μl of each primer,  <dig> or  <dig>  μl  of 50 mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μl of biotaq™ polymerase, 1 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide  to enhance specificity, and ultra pure water making up to 25 μl total volume. pcr fragments were confirmed by sequencing three samples representing each allele of the  <dig> functional markers. pcr product sequences were aligned with sequences of the three genes, downloaded from genbank of ncbi or maizegdb, using clc genomics workbench  sequence analysis software. fragments in the pcr products were resolved using 2% w/v super fine resolution  agarose gel. the names of polymorphic sites of each gene and the nature of polymorphisms are indicated in table  <dig> according to their respective references.

*allelic variants denoted in bold face underlined letters represent the best favourable alleles as proposed in the references. in the current study lcye 5′te yielded no amplification for 73% of the inbred lines invariably. hence there is an additional notation in the results section for those samples scored as a  0’ allele to mean  no amplification’.

statistical analysis
the carotenoid data was analyzed using proc mixed procedure of sas version  <dig>   based on alpha lattice design in which lines were treated as fixed effects, while blocks, replications, years, and year by line interaction were treated as random effects. estimates of repeatability were calculated as indicated in  <cit> . letters for mean separation were generated using a sas macro  <cit> . spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated using sas  <dig>   to test the consistency of ranking of the inbred lines for accumulation of carotenoids across seasons  <cit> .

associations between variation in carotenoid concentration and markers of each gene were calculated using the mixed linear model   <cit>  implemented in tassel version  <dig>   <cit> . mlm incorporates population structure and kinship in the analysis to control spurious association results  <cit> . best linear unbiased estimates  calculated via the generalized linear model  option by selecting only the phenotype data was used for association analysis combined across the two seasons  <cit> . linkage disequilibrium between functional markers was also calculated using the same software. population structure  and kinship of the  <dig> inbred lines were estimated within tassel  <dig>  using  <dig>  snps that covered the  <dig> maize chromosomes generated by genotyping by sequencing  method at the institute for genomic diversity , cornell, usa, according to  <cit> . the snps were filtered out from the gbs pipeline output using a threshold of 5% minimum allele frequency and 20% maximum missing data. in addition,  <dig> snps were filtered using 0% missing and 5% minimum minor allele frequency and used for hierarchical clustering of snp data for  <dig> inbred lines that harbored the favourable alleles of the two most significantly associated markers  to assess their genetic diversity. the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetical averages  provided in powermarker version  <dig>   <cit>  was employed to construct a dendrogram from nei’s  <dig> frequency based distance matrix  <cit> . single and two-way anova were conducted to determine genotype effects of the functional polymorphisms using proc glm and proc mixed of sas  <dig>  .

RESULTS
carotenoid profiles and levels are diverse across the maize inbred lines
the analysis of variance  combined over the two years revealed highly significant variation among the maize inbred lines for all carotenoids, except for α-carotene . the effects of year, and year by line, interaction were significant on all carotenoids, except β-cryptoxanthine. high repeatability estimates ranging from  <dig> to 89%, were recorded for all carotenoids expect for α-carotene demonstrating the importance of the genetic component of the total variation observed for the traits. replication did not have a significant effect on all carotenoids. spearman’s rank correlation coefficients across years were significant  for β-carotene , β-cryptoxanthine,  zeaxanthine  α-carotene  and lutein . zeaxanthine was the dominant carotenoid identified with average mean value of  <dig>  μg g- <dig> followed by β-carotene,  <dig>  μg g- <dig> and lutein,  <dig>  μg g- <dig>  the α-carotene contents of most of the maize inbred lines were very low and not significantly different from zero . estimated means averaged over the two years varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> for lutein, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> for zeaxanthine, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> for β-cryptoxanthine,  <dig> to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> for β-carotene, from  <dig> to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> for provitamin a, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> for total carotenoids .

five different donor lines were determined to have contributed the favourable alleles of crtrb1-5′te and 3′te to the  <dig> inbred lines carrying either one or both of these favourable alleles. the largest proportion of the inbred lines having favourable alleles of crtrb1-5′te and/or -3′te were derived from backcrosses containing a temperate inbred line de <dig> as a donor parent. these inbred lines are among those lines that exhibited the highest levels of provitamin a. in addition, three tropical lines were the recurrent parents of the best inbred lines, also carrying favourable alleles. cluster analysis based on nei’s  <dig> frequency based distance using upgma separated the  <dig> best “favourable-allele-carrying” inbred lines into three major groups with one line separated from the major groups . even though lines originating from the same backcross were grouped together; they showed considerable levels of within group diversity.

association analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between polymorphic alleles  and phenotypes  based on each year mean and means averaged over two years. alpha-carotene was excluded as a phenotype from the analysis due to its extremely low concentrations and lack of significant variability among the maize inbred lines. the results of the association analysis are presented in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the 3′te and 5′te polymorphic sites of the crtrb <dig> candidate gene were found to be significantly associated with carotenoids, and all the derived traits, consistently over the two years . the exceptions were lutein levels which were not affected by both crtrb <dig> markers, and the α to β branch carotenoids ratio which was not affected by crtrb1-5′te in the second year. the two crtrb <dig> markers explained from  <dig> to 53% of the variation in carotenoids and derived traits in the first year, and from  <dig> to 63% in the second year inferring from the r <dig> values . crtrb1-indel <dig> accounted for 9% of the variation in provitamin a . the functional dna markers for lcye, though not consistent, were significantly associated only with lutein, and the ratio of β to α branch carotenoids, explaining  <dig> to 21% of the variations. however, lcye-5′te did not significantly affect β to α branch ratio in the first year and lcye-3′indel was not associated with any of the traits. none of the markers for each gene had significant effects on total carotenoid content in both years which is consistent with previous association analyses results  <cit> . however, due to variation in results of association and segregation mapping, earlier studies detected significant reduction of total carotenoids for genotypes with favourable alleles of lcye and crtrb <dig> using segregating populations  <cit> .

combinatorial effects of lyce and crtrbi functional markers on carotenoid levels and profiles
fourteen unique genotypes were observed for lcye and eight unique genotypes for crtrb <dig> . the two-way anova combining the lcye and crtrb <dig> alleles revealed highly significant interaction effects for each carotenoid type and the derived traits. the combined effects of the alleles of the two genes were stronger than their separate effects. the two genes model explained  <dig> to 89% of the total variation in carotenoid concentration. individual effects of the alleles were also highly significant for almost all carotenoids. the combined lcye markers explained the least variation in the β-branch carotenoids , while thecrtrb1markers explained the least variation in the α-branch carotenoid . the combined crtrb <dig> markers had larger effects on individual and total provitamin a carotenoids in comparison to the effects of the lcye markers.

discussion
maize is an important staple food crop for food and livelihood security in africa. since the 1970s, iita has had a maize breeding program to develop tropical maize lines that are high-yielding and adapted to growing conditions across africa. to help alleviate micronutrient deficiencies amongst the poor whose diets are highly dependent on maize, the development of tropical adapted maize lines with elevated levels of carotenoids, in particular provitamin a, is a major maize improvement goal.

to facilitate the development of high vitamin a tropical maize varieties, the carotenoid profile and content of  <dig> tropical adapted inbred lines within the conventional breeding program for tropical maize at iita were analysed over two seasons under field conditions. within these  <dig> inbred lines,  <dig> lines were found to have a provitamin a content of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> which is higher than previously reported by  <cit>  and is comparable to the highest provitamin a level described in  <cit> . this finding highlights the importance of introgressing the best favourable alleles of provitamin a from temperate germplasm into tropical adapted inbred lines. the maximum average estimated level of total carotenoids detected was  <dig>  μg g- <dig>  which was much lower than the 100 μg g- <dig> previously reported  <cit> . the identification of inbred lines with high total carotenoid levels is considered to be useful if the high influx of substrates to the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway favors an increase in provitamin a carotenoids in maize endosperm  <cit> .

dna markers detecting polymorphisms in genes that are functionally responsible for changes in phenotypes can be called functional markers  <cit> . eight functional markers of three key carotenoid genes psy <dig> <cit> , lcye <cit>  and crtrb <dig> <cit> , , were considered for validation in this study. the functional markers for the two genes lcye and crtrb <dig> have been described as one of the most exciting discoveries for maize endosperm provitamin a improvement endeavors  <cit> . however, independent studies demonstrated some inconsistencies in the effects of these markers  <cit>  which necessitates additional investigations so that such markers can be deployed in maize breeding in a more robust and predictable manner. in the earlier studies, the panels and populations used for developing and validating the functional markers were largely of temperate origin and had low frequencies of the favourable alleles of the most significant markers. in our field study over two years, these functional markers have been analysed for their efficacy in diverse maize inbred lines derived mainly from populations containing a mixture of tropical and temperate germplasm in their pedigrees. our study clearly demonstrates that the effects are heritable thereby can facilitate the development of robust maize varieties with elevated provitamin a levels.

the functional markers for psy <dig> were monomorphic for the favourable allelic variants across all the inbred lines possibly because of the highly conserved nature of the psy <dig> gene within and across species  <cit> . for instance, fu et al.  <cit>  have observed that the favourable alleles of psy <dig> were fixed within the tropical genetic background of the panels used in their study. the variation in total carotenoid content observed in our study could be due either to the presence of some rare functional variation within the psy <dig> gene and its regulatory regions  and/or other “modifier” genes that are involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis in the genotypes tested  <cit> .

the markers for lcye and crtrb <dig> were polymorphic across the maize inbred lines, where in the 3′ and 5′te markers of crtrb <dig> exhibited strong association with variation in β-carotene content of the inbred lines. in contrast, the effects of lcye markers were found to be weak and inconsistent in the present study, which was in line with previous results  <cit> .the germplasm within the tropical maize gene pool is known to be more diverse than that in the temperate maize gene pool. in a previous study yan et al.  <cit>  detected the favourable allele of crtrb1-5′te only in the temperate yellow maize germplasm, with a frequency of less than 3%. in our study on tropical maize germplasm, this allele occurred at a relatively high frequency of 18%. the high linkage disequilibrium  between the 3′te and 5′te polymorphisms of crtrb <dig> detected in our study deviates from a previous report  <cit>  that found no linkage disequilibrium . it is probable that the two favourable alleles were introgressed  together as genetically linked alleles that led to the observed strong linkage disequilibrium between the two markers. such linkage disequilibrium makes the estimation of the independent effect of each marker difficult. however, based on results of previous studies  <cit> , it can be argued that both markers could be contributing to the strong association of crtrb <dig> with provitamin a in maize endosperm, with the 5′te polymorphism contributing the largest effect.

one of the maize lines  was also used for developing five different segregating populations used by  <cit>  to test the effect of crtrb1-3′te polymorphism  <cit> . in our study, this line along with  <dig> other inbred lines carried the best favourable alleles of crtrb1-5′te and -3′te polymorphisms and was used to evaluate to what extent the lines carrying the two favourable alleles in this study were different from the segregating population used in  <cit> . upgma cluster analysis of snps based on nei’s  <dig> distance  separated the lines according to their genetic backgrounds. substantial genetic variation was found among the lines originating from the same backcross. the line used by  <cit>  was clustered with one of the major groups thus underpinning the diversity of the lines used in our study. in previous analyses, the effect of crtrb1-5′te, the marker that was reported to have the largest effect in the work of yan et al.  <cit> , was not reported in the validation study of  <cit> . hence, our study fills a major gap by now providing the marker-trait association results for crtrb1-5′te in tropical adapted maize germplasm.

almost all of the inbred maize lines with high levels of β-carotene and total provitamin a carried the favourable alleles of the most significant functional markers of crtrb1-3 t’ and crtrb1-5′te. an inconsistency detected in our marker-trait study was a maize inbred line that showed unexpectedly low β-carotene and provitamin a  although it carried the favourable allele of crtrb1-5′te polymorphism. this inbred line also had relatively lower total carotenoid content , possibly suggesting that high influx of substrates into the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway may be an important factor to realize the desired action of the favourable alleles  <cit> . hence, introgression of these favourable alleles into adapted maize germplasm with high total carotenoid content could be a strategy for increasing levels of β-carotene and total provitamin a.

the combinatorial analysis of the functional polymorphisms for the two genes revealed larger effects than those observed for alleles of each gene independently. this finding is in agreement with results of previous studies  <cit> . in particular, our analysis identified a number of superior genotypes of maize inbred lines that have carotenoid levels of relevance to provitamin a level enhancement that exceed previously obtained levels within iita’s breeding program. our results indicates that the functional markers for crtrb <dig> markers have the strongest potential to accelerate genetic gain for enhanced β-carotene content in tropical maize breeding programs  <cit> . given that the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is most likely conditioned by a number of genes and regulatory elements, and that all of the variation in provitamin a levels are not accounted for, it can be worthwhile to consider genomic selection approaches for enhanced provitamin a carotenoid levels.

CONCLUSIONS
the first generation of provitamin a enriched maize hybrids have been developed for nigeria and zambia recently, which will most likely spread to other african countries with similar agro-ecologies over the coming years  <cit> . in this two year field study on tropical maize germplasm we have demonstrated the strong association between favourable alleles detected by the crtrb1-5′te and -3′te functional markers and high levels of β-carotene. our study found these two markers to be in strong linkage disequilibrium in the tropical maize germplasm, raising the possibility that one of the polymorphic sites  could be targeted to reduce costs associated with pcr genotyping. the high provitamin a inbred lines harbouring combinations of the favourable alleles of the crtrb1-5’te and crtrb1-3’te markers can be used to speed up the development of the next generation of high provitamin a tropical maize hybrids for production in sub-saharan africa, thus contributing to the alleviation of hidden hunger due to vitamin a deficiency.
