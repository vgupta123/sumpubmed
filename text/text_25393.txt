BACKGROUND
rapid improvements of high-throughput genotyping technologies enable us to detect genetic variations with much finer resolution than before. in genome-wide association  studies of complex diseases, a few thousands samples are collected and hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been genotyped for each sample  <cit> .

researchers have been investigating disease-associated gene mapping for decades and various approaches have been proposed. however, most of them have used a single-snp based strategy, in which each snp is analyzed individually . due to the sophisticated regulatory mechanism encoded in the human genome, it is widely agreed that complex traits are typically caused by multiple genetic variations. one type of genetic variation influences the traits individually. this is known as main effects. another type of genetic variation is that snps may show little effect individually, but strong effects jointly. this is known as epistasis or multilocus interactions  <cit> . therefore, multi-locus based approaches are believed to have higher power than single-locus based ones. identifying epistatic interactions arises as an important problem in multi-locus based approaches  <cit> .

recently, an increasing number of research has reported the presence of epistatic interactions in complex diseases, such as type- <dig> diabetes  <cit> . in order to detect epistatic interaction, various computational and statistical methods have developed  <cit> . for example, nelson et al.  <cit>  proposed a combinatorial partitioning method  that enumerated multi-locus genotypes and evaluated them with phenotypes. culverhouse et al.  <cit>  proposed a restricted partitioning method  to improve the efficiency of cpm. millstein et al.  <cit>  developed a testing framework when epistasis is present. ritchie et al.  <cit>  proposed a multifactor-dimensionality reduction  method that identified interactions based on classification accuracy through exhaustive search. zhang and liu  <cit>  proposed a bayesian epistasis association mapping  method to address the issue of epistasis mapping in genome-wide scale by using markov chain monte carlo  method. in spite of their promising performance, most of these methods only show their successes in association studies on small-scale data sets.

from our view, detecting disease-associated snps and their interactions can be cast as the variable selection problem in the framework of regression analysis. standard tools for variable assessment are the methods of multivariate regression. in traditional applications of multivariate regression, the number of variables is less than the number of samples. in the context of snp-based disease association studies, however, the number of snps is far more than the number of samples, making it difficult or even impossible to directly apply standard multivariate regression methods.

it is widely agreed in gwa studies that only a small fraction of snps is disease-associated. in the multivariate regression framework, this implies that most regression coefficients should be zero. this motivates us to impose a sparsity constraint to the regression model. in addition, snps are bi-allelic markers . each snp has only three genotypes: two homozygous genotypes  and one heterozygous genotype . therefore, each snp can be naturally treated as a three-level factor and be coded with three dummy variables. similarly, the interaction between two snps can be treated as a nine-level factor. in order to encourage sparsity on factors  rather than a single dummy variable, we impose a group constraint on the set of dummy variables that represent a disease model . hence, we propose an adaptive group lasso  method to identify main effects and epistatic interactions from large-scale snp data. since lasso  <cit>  is well known for imposing a sparsity constraint at the variable level, we employ group lasso  <cit>  to impose the sparsity constraint at the factor level, and develop adaptive reweighting to enhance the sparsity and to reduce false positive finding.

RESULTS
in this section, we evaluate the performance of our method using both simulated and real data. in simulation studies, we compare our method with some recent competitors under a wide range of epistatic models. for the real case-control study, we use the rheumatoid arthritis  data set from the wellcome trust case control consortium .

simulation studies
in simulation studies, we mainly compare our method agl with lasso, beam and mdr.

we choose lasso  <cit>  for comparison due to the close relationship between our method and the two lasso methods. for the identification of main effects, they presume additive, dominant or recessive effects when fitting the lasso model. for the identification of interactions, hoggart et. al  <cit>  do not consider this issues and wu et. al  <cit>  only restrict themselves to the snps with strong main effects. our method is different from their methods in the following sense:

 we do not presume particular types of main effects and interactions. thus, our model is more flexible.

 we impose a sparsity constraint at the factor level instead of at the variable level.

 our model includes all possible interactions and is able to identify interactions with weak main effects.

we also compare with beam  <cit>  which arises as a powerful epistasis mapping method. both methods share the concept of three snp classes: unassociated snps, snps with main effects and snps with interactions. beam builds a bayesian partition model based on these three classes. it is worth mentioning that there is only a single group of interacting snps in the beam model. to identify multiple interacting groups, beam implicitly makes use of mcmc to visit possible interactions. we explicitly allow multiple groups of interacting snps and impose additive effects between those groups. comprehensive comparison studies between beam and other related methods have been carried out in  <cit> .

due to the limited space, the comparison with mdr is given in the supplementary. we further conduct null simulation to estimate the type i error rate of our method.

in the following experiments, we use five-fold cross-validation in model fitting process. we use bonferroni correction to adjust our p-value and set the significance threshold as  <dig>  in simulation studies. in the released version of beam, the threshold is set as  <dig> . thus, we choose the same threshold.

comparison with lasso
we conduct experiments under two scenarios.

• scenario 1: identification of main effects.

to illustrate our point, we consider two disease models m1- <dig> and m1- <dig>  as given in table  <dig>  m1- <dig> is a multiplicative model used in both  <cit>  and  <cit> . m1- <dig> is proposed in  <cit>  to exhibit the interference effect. we choose these two models with different minor allele frequencies  to illustrate the influence of model specification when identifying main effects. under each model setting, we generate  <dig> data sets which contains  <dig> snps.

the performance of lasso and agl is summarized in fig.  <dig>  the power of each method is calculated as the ratio between the number of successful identifications of disease loci and the number of data sets. lasso performs slightly better than our method for model m1- <dig>  but it performs much worse than our method for model m1- <dig>  here are the reasons: firstly, we impose additive effects of snps in lasso model fitting and then perform statistical tests with df =  <dig>  secondly, for agl we do not assume additive effects of snps but use a more general model structure  in method) and perform statistical tests with df =  <dig>  therefore, lasso performs better under m1- <dig> since the imposed additive structure in lasso agrees well with the structure in model m1- <dig>  m1- <dig> exhibits interference effect which can not be well approximated by additive, dominant or recessive effect. lasso performs much worse than adaptive group lasso due to the model mismatch.

• scenario 2: identification of interaction effects.

the model mismatch problem of lasso is more serious when identifying interactions. here we consider four epistatic models m1- <dig> ~ m1- <dig> used in  <cit> , as given in table  <dig>  here we report the performance of lasso and agl under these four models. the comparison results of other epistatic models in  <cit>  are similar. for lasso method, we take different main effects and their interactions into consideration during lasso model fitting. here we use our interaction model  in method). we simulate two associated snps based on the disease models, and gradually increase the number of noise snps. fig.  <dig> summarizes the experimental results. the power is calculated as the proportion of the  <dig> data sets in which interactions of the disease associated snps are detected. lasso with presumed main effects  loses its power rapidly as the number of noise snps increases, while agl keeps its power when more noise snps are involved in model fitting.

here we only provide four pure epistatisis models used in comparison with lasso. the complete model list used in comparison with beam is provided in our supplementary document .

generally speaking, if the underlying interaction could be well characterized by lasso with a presumed model structure, e.g., additive model, then the statistical power of lasso would be higher than that of agl because lasso uses less degree of freedom. however, since the underlying interaction is generally unknown and its possible pattern may cover a wide range of spectrum  <cit> , agl can serves as a valuable tool for discovering interactions in larger model space. hence, agl and lasso may be complementary to each other in gwa studies.

we show the effect of adaptive reweighting in fig.  <dig>  the first reweighting greatly reduces the number of selected dummy variable groups and the reweighting process converges in a few iterations . the adaptive reweighting process reduces the number of unassociated groups and leads to more accurate p-value calculation in the statistical testing.

on the other hand, however, it can also be seen that unassociated groups may enter the final model even after adaptive reweighting. hence, the selected groups in the final model may not be associated with the phenotype. in this regard, the significance assessment is critically needed.

comparison with beam
we shall not compare our method with beam when genetic heterogeneities are present since beam is not developed to handle these cases . we shall compare with beam from two perspectives:

 <dig>  the ability of detecting epistatic interactions when the main effect is weak or even absent.

 <dig>  the ability of detecting multiple interactions.

detecting epistatic interactions with weak main effect
a wide range of interaction models without marginal effects has been discussed in  <cit> . here we consider the  <dig> pure epistatic models in  <cit>  to compare the performance between agl and beam. the details of these models are available in the supplementary document. the heritability h <dig> of these  <dig> models ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and the

maf ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . we use  <dig> data sets for each disease model. there are  <dig> cases,  <dig> controls, and  <dig> snps in each data set.

the comparison between our method and beam in fig.  <dig> shows that agl is superior to beam for detecting epistatic interactions without main effects. for the models with maf =  <dig> ,  <dig>  and h <dig> ≥  <dig> , the power of our method is above 95%, while that of beam is roughly 20%. the performances of the two methods degrade as the heritability h <dig> decreases: the power of beam is lower than 5% for the models with maf =  <dig>  and h <dig> ≤  <dig> , while the power of our method still remains at about 75% for some of these models and is even higher for the models with maf =  <dig> .

our model includes all possible interactions  in the model fitting process, so there is no chance to miss interesting interactions. the good performance of our model is due to the group-sparsity constraint: it identifies interactions in a grouped manner. this is very helpful to weaken the influence of noise snps.

the poor performance of beam is not due to the statistical testing power of the b-statistics  <cit> , but the sampling efficiency. we carefully examined the interactions in the disease models with h <dig> ≥  <dig> : those interactions are very significant even after the bonferroni correction of b-statistics. notice that beam runs  <dig> ×  <dig> mcmc iterations which are  <dig> times of pairwise exhaustive search in the simulation study. thus, our conjecture is that mcmc might converge too slowly to find the ground truth .

detecting multiple interactions
another disadvantage of beam is that it only allows a single interacting group in its bayesian partition model. to compensate for this limitation, beam uses mcmc sampling strategy to visit possible interactions during model optimization. in contrast, our approach allows multiple interacting groups and imposes additive effects for these interactions. this flexibility enables us to have a higher power to identify multiple interactions. due to the limited space, we show our comparison result of detecting multiple interactions in the supplementary.

null simulation study
to validate the use of our p-value and to estimate the type-i error, we conduct null simulation studies in two cases:

• case 1: we generate  <dig> null datasets. each dataset contains  <dig> k snps and  <dig> samples. all the snps are generated independently with maf uniformly distributed in . in this case, the nominal type-i error rates should be  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> per one million snps for significance thresholds at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> .

• case 2: we use genomesimla  <cit>  to simulate the snp data based on the marker information on the affymetrix  <dig> k chip from human chromosome  <dig>  linkage disequilibrium  exists among snps. we also generate  <dig> null datasets, each of which contains  <dig> snps and  <dig> samples. due to ld pattern, the error rate should lower than the nominal error rate.

we summarize the type-i error of our model  in table  <dig>  for case  <dig>  our results are reasonable for the three nominal levels. for case  <dig>  our type-i error rates show that our method is conservative when ld exists.

the nominal type-i error rates should be  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> per one million snps for significance thresholds at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.

analysis of wtccc data
main effects
current version of beam software can not handle wtccc data on the genome-wide scale. to compare with beam on the real data, we apply our main effect model  and beam to analyze wtccc rheumatoid arthritis  data in the chromosome-wise manner. for beam, we run  <dig> mcmc and set the significant threshold as  <dig>  after bonferroni correction. beam does not report any interactions. the identified main effects of the two methods agree with each other. some of them are given in table  <dig> and the details are given in the supplementary document. the significant result from wtccc  <cit>  could be reproduced.

• wtccc reports that snp rs <dig> located at 6p <dig> shows a very strong association. our experiment verifies this result.

• we do not identify snp rs <dig> located at 1p <dig> reported by wtccc. instead, we identify two snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> near snp rs <dig>  the signals of these two snps are much stronger than rs <dig> 

• we also identify snps in the moderate association regions reported in  <cit> . we summarize the result in table  <dig> 

interactions
detecting interactions in genome-wide scale is very challenging and multi-stage strategies are often explored. for example, mdr  <cit>  usually is combined with turf  <cit>  which serves as a filter to remove those noise snps. currently, our method agl can not be directly applied to genome-wide scale snp data since it is too computationally intensive to exhaustively search for all snp pairs. as suggested in simulation study, our method keeps its statistical power when about  <dig>  snp pairs are considered in our model. thus, the main difficulty is the computation burden of searching for all snp pairs. thus, a filtering method is necessary for our method.

for identification of epistatic interactions, we focus on two candidate regions: 6p <dig> and 7p <dig>  these two regions are reported in our previous work named snpharvester  <cit>  which is a filtering method. here we apply our interaction model  and report some snp interactions in table  <dig> 

• for the region 6p <dig>  we select a segment covering the snps reported in  <cit> . this segment contains  <dig> snps from rs <dig> to rs <dig>  we enumerate all possible interactions and include them in our model. our method reports two interacting pairs:  and . these snps are related to gene hla-dra. the result in  <cit>  reports that there is a strong association between ra and hla gene family. notice that the two snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> cannot be identified by univariate analysis due to their weak main effects . however, they do show a strong interaction. we also run beam on the selected segment . beam reports  and  as the two most significant interactions based on the b-statistics. we carefully check these two pairs based on the logistic regression model. we find that the interaction of the snp pair  is very weak using the standard χ <dig> test based on logistic regression models with df =  <dig>  while the interaction of the snp pair  is strong. we further explore the reason why our method does not report the interacting pair . we observe that snp rs <dig>  which is highly correlated  with snp rs <dig>  enters our model as a main effect term. consequently, the pair  does not enter the model as a interaction term. this shows that the snp pair  should not be reported as an interacting pair.

• for the region 7p <dig>  we select a segment which covers the snps reported in  <cit> . the segment contains  <dig> snps from snp rs <dig> to snp rs <dig>  we analyze this region and report one interacting pairs . the two snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> are related to gene thsd7a on chromosome  <dig>  which has been reported to be associated with bone mineral density  <cit> . this shows plausible biological relevance. we also run beam on the segment. but it does not report any interaction.

• neither beam nor our method finds significant interactions in the region 6q <dig> 

the definition of interactions is not consistent in literatures. for example, the interaction effect of two snps is define via logistic regression models of genotypes and their combinations  <cit> , while it is also defined via models of haplotypes  <cit> . the interactions reported above are based on the definition of interaction of a snp pair in  <cit> . we extend this definition such that we can simultaneously handle interactions of multiple snp pairs. the details are given in the method section. we realize that the interacting snps reported above are close to each other on the physical map. this type of interaction effects may be caused by the haplotype effect. detecting interactions of genes in different genome regions by analyzing genome-wide snp data is still under investigation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we proposed an adaptive group lasso method for large-scale snp data analysis. the novelty of our method is that it analyzes snps and their interactions simultaneously. it imposes a sparsity constraint at the group level and enables us to identify associated snps  from large-scale snp data robustly. we show that our method outperforms its recent competitors in both simulation studies and real application.

the limitation of our method is that the interaction model can not be directly applied to genome-wide scale snp data analysis. the main difficulty comes from the computation burden of searching for all snp pairs. there are two possible solutions to solve this issue. one solution is to make use of some filtering method to reduce the number of snps to a manageable size, for example,  <cit> . another solution is incorporating biological information. pathway information  <cit>  provides a biological clue to narrow down the search range for interaction detection. we shall investigate this in our future work.
