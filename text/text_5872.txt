BACKGROUND
doxorubicin  is a potent and broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, and breast, lung, and ovarian cancers  <cit> . the antitumor mechanism of dox involves inhibition of both topoisomerase ii and dna synthesis  <cit> . unfortunately, long-term treatment with dox is limited by irreversible cardiomyopathic changes and consequent congestive heart failure. the cardiotoxicity is believed to be caused by the generation of free radicals leading to dysfunction of mitochondria in cardiac cells, interference with cell calcium regulation, and bioenergetic failure  <cit> .

the in vitro metabolism of dox by cardiac and liver microsomal membranes includes enzymes such as cytosolic xanthine oxidase, microsomal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate -cytochrome p <dig> reductase, which is present in all tissues , and mitochondrial cytosolic nadph dehydrogenase, which is uniquely present in cardiac cells  <cit> . dox is bio-reduced to a semiquinone free radical that rapidly undergoes 1) further reduction to a hydroquinone, 2) formation of covalent adducts with dna or proteins, or 3) transfer of the unpaired electron to an electron acceptor  <cit> . in the presence of oxygen, the semiquinone radical produces o <dig> -, which can be converted by superoxide dismutase to hydrogen peroxide . in the presence of reduced iron, h2o <dig> is decomposed to the highly toxic hydroxyl radical . superoxide, h2o <dig>  and ho. cause peroxidation of unsaturated membrane lipids and induce irreversible tissue damage by inactivating key proteins and enzymes present in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and in the mitochondrial respiratory chain  <cit> .

considerable attention has been paid to alleviate dox-induced oxidative stress with dox by compounds that 1) function as antioxidants or 2) regulate the expression of endogenous antioxidants. for example, carvedilol  <cit> , melatonin and its synthetic derivatives  <cit> , metallothionein  <cit> , iron and iron chelators  <cit>  have been tested. to date, dexrazoxane is the only iron chelator that has been approved for reducing dox-induced cardiotoxicity. however, this chelator also reduces dox's antineoplastic activity, causes myelosuppression, and may increase the risk of developing secondary malignancies  <cit> .

the thiol group plays an important role in biological system. thiol oxidation can result in protein structure alteration leading to compromise of protein function. the thiol group appearing in a variety of proteins or nonproteins, e.g. glutathione , undergoes reversible thiol-disulfide interactions to mediate the oxidant-induced stress  <cit> . the use of biothiols, such as gsh, n-acetylcysteine , homocysteine, cysteine , and γ-glutamyl cysteine, to mitigate acute oxidative stress induced by anticancer drugs has long been proposed, though their efficacies have not been fully evaluated. nac did not provide significant antioxidant effects, presumably due to its low lipid solubility that limits its bioavailability  <cit> . for instance, nac at  <dig> mg/kg body weight failed to prevent acute dox-induced cardiotoxicity  <cit> . the carboxyl group in nac is negatively charged at physiological ph, limiting its ability to cross cell membranes. recently, n-acetylcysteine amide , a structural analogue of nac, was synthesized and evaluated in certain in vivo and in vitro models. replacing the carboxyl group with an amide increases lipophilicity, allowing it to cross cell membranes. two studies have shown that naca could cross the blood-brain barrier, chelate cu2+ , scavenge free-radicals, protect red blood cells from oxidative stress, and prevent ros-induced activation of c-jun n-terminal protein kinase , mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk , and matrix metalloproteinases  <cit> .

the ability of naca to protect cardiomyocytes from dox-induced toxicity has not been investigated. we hypothesized that naca would protect h9c <dig> cardiomyocytes by reducing oxidative stress. accordingly, we determined the ability of naca to mitigate the cytotoxicity of dox in h9c <dig> cells and correlated these effects with the attenuation of oxidative stress.

RESULTS
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin  and n-acetylcysteine amide  on h9c <dig> cells
to determine a sublethal concentration of naca for the study on its ability to protect h9c <dig> cells from dox-induced toxicity, we first exposed cells with naca at  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm, and  <dig> mm for  <dig> h. a comparative study was conducted on nac. both naca and nac induced significant cytotoxicity at concentrations ≥  <dig> mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively. cell viability was further reduced by 80% at  <dig> mm of naca or nac  . at  <dig>  mm of naca or nac, the cell viability is comparable to the control group. thus, we conservatively selected both antioxidants at  <dig>  mm in our subsequent studies for comparison purpose.

effect of naca on dox-induced cytotoxicity
the dox-induced toxicity was both concentration- and time-dependent in the range of  <dig>  –  <dig> μm. cell viability at  <dig>  μm was reduced by ca. 25%, 60%, and 70% at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h, respectively . to study the protective effect of naca and nac on dox-induced toxicity, cells were treated with  <dig> μm naca or nac for  <dig> h prior to incubation with freshly prepared cell medium containing both dox and naca or nac at designated final concentrations. both naca and nac had minimal protective effects on cytotoxicity at all concentrations of dox and over a period of  <dig> h exposure. naca was most effective at  <dig> μm of dox. accordingly,  <dig> μm dox was used in the subsequent studies on oxidative stress.

dox-induced oxidative stress in the presence or absence of naca
treatment with  <dig> μm dox increased ros by 56% compared to the control group . the increase was reduced to the control group level in the presence of  <dig> μm naca  . the endogenous levels of gsh and cys were significantly reduced after a  <dig> h exposure to dox . treatment with naca + dox resulted in gsh and cys levels that were higher than those observed in the dox-only group . interestingly, in comparison with the control group, the gsh level in the naca-only group was significantly increased , while the cys levels in the naca-only group were similar to the control .

naca restored gsh/gssg ratio
a change in cellular gsh content is usually accompanied by a concomitant change in the gssg  levels. the gssg content in the dox-only group was increased by 61% compared to the control group. naca reduced the increased gssg content to the control group level . the gsh/gssg ratio reflects accumulation of gssg, thus is a more reliable indicator of cellular redox status. while the ratio was decreased by 47% upon administration of dox, naca treatment restored it substantially  . interestingly, the gsh/gssg ratio in the naca-only group was higher than in the control group, suggesting that naca provides cells with additional cysteine for gsh synthesis .

naca reduced lipid peroxidation induced by dox
dox at  <dig> μm elevated lipid peroxidation as indicated by the increased detection of cellular tba-mda complex. naca significantly reduced lipid peroxidation compared to the dox-only group  . lipid peroxidation in the naca-only group did not differ from the control group .

significance indicated by: *p <  <dig>  compared to control cells; ** p <  <dig>  compared to dox-only group.

naca restored activities of antioxidant enzymes: catalase , gluthathione peroxidase , gluthathione reductase 
cat activity was 61% lower in the dox-only group than in the control group , while naca treatment eliminated this reduction  . dox reduced gpx activity by 50% compared to the control . naca was capable of fully mitigating the reduction  . gr activity was 84% lower in dox-only cells compared to the control group , and naca significantly restored the reduction  . activity of cat, gpx, and gr did not differ between the control group and naca-only group.

significance indicated by: *p <  <dig>  compared to control cells; **p <  <dig>  compared to dox-only group.

discussion
in the present study, dox significantly reduced cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. though naca reduced oxidative stress, it had only minimal protective effects on dox-induced cytotoxicity. thus, it appears that dox-induced cell death may have involved redox shift-independent mechanism. previous studies have shown that dox toxicity can be mediated by the redox-shift dependent pathway as well as by topoisomerase ii activation; the latter leads to dna cleavage, caspase- <dig> activation and eventually apoptosis  <cit> . the precise contributions of ros-dependent pathways and the topoisomerase- pathway to dox-induced cell death remain to be determined.

naca was capable of restoring gsh, cys, and gsh/gssg ratio that were reduced by dox. naca supplementation reduced oxidative stress by at least two means. first, naca may supply cysteine required for gsh synthesis. second, naca may convert gssg to gsh by a non-enzymatic thiol-disulfide exchange. this argument is supported by the increased gsh level observed in the naca-only group. our finding on the increased gsh levels in the naca-only group is in agreement with offen et al.  <cit> . offen et al. further suggested that naca was also able to reduce cu2+-mediated free radical formation, through an undetermined chemical mechanism  <cit> .

naca prevented the dox-induced decrease of gr activity. a similar phenomenon of gr activity protection by antioxidants was observed in a study on cadmium-induced oxidative toxicity  <cit> . the mechanism of restoration remains unclear, though one suggestion has been made. gr-mediated reduction of gssg to gsh is nadph-dependent. regeneration of nadph from nadp+ requires glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase . however, g6pd activity may also be reduced by oxidative stress; thus, gr activity might be limited by the g6pd-dependent supply of nadph. it is possible that naca prevented dox-induced decrease of g6pd activity. in the present study, however, g6pd activity was not measured, and additional studies are required to evaluate this mechanism. it should be noted that although gr plays an important role in regenerating endogenous gsh from gssg, new studies suggested that alternative mechanisms to reduce gssg and other disulfides may just be enough for animal's normal viability  <cit> . in addition to the above pathways to increase cellular gsh content, glutathione s-transferase  may conjugate gsh directly to oxidized derivatives of dox and thus play a crucial role in attenuating the elevated oxidative stress  <cit> .

increase or activation of endogenous ros-scavenging antioxidants or enzymes has been shown to protect cells from oxidative damage. for instance, 3h- <dig> -dithiole-3-thione, a chemoprotective agent, protects against dox-mediated injury in cardiac cells by inducing cellular antioxidants and enzymes such as gsh, cat, gpx, gr, and gst  <cit> . in the present study, the activities of cat, gpx, and gr in h9c <dig> cells were significantly decreased following treatment with dox, but their levels remained at near control values in the presence of naca, reflecting the restoration of a healthier cellular redox state.

cat is particularly important in that its relatively low constitutive level in cardiacmyocytes may predispose cardiac muscle to oxidative stress damage  <cit> . it has been shown that cat activity can be significantly reduced by dox  <cit> . in the present study, naca was able to prevent the loss of cat activity caused by subsequent to dox.

cardiac muscle is very susceptible to oxidative damage due in part to the rapid inactivation of gpx  <cit> . overexpression of gpx in endothelial cells and myocytes significantly decreases dox-induced nf-kb activation which leads to apoptosis  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the enzymatic activity of gpx, which utilizes gsh as a substrate to reduce h2o <dig> to h2o, is decreased by dox. this fall in gpx activity might be a result of the decrease in gsh, as suggested by others  <cit> . the increased intracellular gsh content in the naca group might activate the gsh-dependent gpx, thereby preventing the accumulation of h2o <dig>  thus, the ability of naca to reactivate gpx activity in our study is further evidence of cardioprotection.

CONCLUSIONS
though naca was able to provide oxidative relief, it only had minimal protective effect on dox-induced cytotoxicity. naca prevented oxidative stress by elevation of gsh and cys, reduction of ros and lipid peroxidation, and restoration of antioxidant enzyme activities. further studies to identify various mechanisms of cytotoxicity and their inter-relationships, if any, which lead to dox-induced cell death are warranted.
