BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  is a major post-transcriptional mechanism for producing multiple isoforms from the same precursor mrna , thereby increasing the complexity of the transcriptome/proteome. as is widespread in eukaryotes, and it has been suggested that over 95% of genes in human are alternatively spliced  <cit> . in contrast, 30% ~ 60% of genes in arabidopsis or rice have been identified to undergo as  <cit> . as appears to be relatively less prevalent in plants than in mammals, but this may in part be due to limited detection of alternatively spliced variants  in plants.

as has been demonstrated to be involved in various biological functions  <cit>  such as spatio-temporal regulation  <cit> , disease resistance  <cit> , and photosynthesis  <cit> . asvs occur in both coding sequences  and untranslated regions . asvs in cdss can have influences on protein structure, subcellular localization, protein stability, post-translational modifications, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interaction networks  <cit> . on the other hand, asvs in 5′ utrs  may include/exclude upstream open reading frames , thereby altering translational stability/efficiency   <cit> . even so, a considerable number of asvs are functionally irrelevant, or merely by-products during rna splicing  <cit> . it remains challenging to determine whether an asv is functionally important  <cit> , not to mention that as is less characterized in plants than in mammals, and that most plant asvs have unknown functional consequences  <cit> , but also that some of computationally-annotated genes/transcripts are subject to erroneous prediction. although much effort to annotate plant transcripts produces several prominent databases  <cit> , there still lacks an effective strategy to make use of public resources  for better annotation of asvs and accurate identification of novel isoforms in plant genomes.

in terms of molecular evolution, alternatively spliced exons and constitutively spliced exons are known to be under different evolutionary pressures. previous studies reported that alternatively spliced exons tend to have higher nonsynonymous substitution rates  and nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rates  than constitutively spliced ones, indicating faster protein-level evolution in the former  <cit> . on the other hand, alternatively spliced exons were observed to have lower ds values than constitutively spliced ones due to the elevated synonymous rate in the latter  <cit> . this suggests that constitutively spliced exons are subject to weaker selection pressure than alternatively spliced ones at the rna level. therefore, the differences in evolutionary patterns may serve as an indicator to distinguish between these two types of exons.

in this study, we aimed to update the annotations of three crop plants, namely rice , maize , and sorghum . we designed a pipeline, exonfinder, for the identification of novel exons/asvs based on comparative genomics of the est libraries of nine grass plants, including barley , maize, meadow ryegrass , purple false brome , rice, sorghum, sugarcane , switchgrass , and wheat . such analysis resulted in the identification of a total of  <dig>  asv events  in rice, maize, and sorghum, with  <dig>  novel exons that were cross-species conserved but not supported by prior ensembl annotation or est evidence from the same species. evolutionary analysis reveals that though the novel exons are generally under more relaxed selection pressure than their flanking ones, some of them evolve at a similar evolutionary rate with their flanking exons. we reasoned that some of the previously-annotated isoforms that excluded the newly-identified exons may be subject to erroneous prediction. to test this possibility, we randomly selected rice exons of this kind, performed rt-pcr-sequencing, and found that over half  of previously-annotated isoforms that excluded the novel exons were not detected in the same setting. the consistent results were observed in three rice cultivars  and two wild rice species . finally, we also discussed the functional potential of selected asvs through the lens of evolution.

RESULTS
identification of novel exons in rice, maize, and sorghum
we introduced an in silico pipeline, exonfinder, to identify previously unannotated exons/asvs in target species  by comparative analysis of the est library of non-target  species against the genome of target species . to achieve a better quality of cross-species alignment, we only considered grass plants in this study . we supposed that the novel exons also represented novel as events, since they were absent from known transcripts of the target species . exonfinder identifies two types of novel exons: cassette exons and retained introns . authenticity and novelty of exons were considered through the following procedures. to eliminate false positives from accidental matches, we only considered est matches that satisfied the following criteria:  a proper exon and its flanking exons must overlap with the same ensembl-annotated transcript;  a proper cassette exon must be flanked by canonical splicing sites at its both ends; and  a proper exon that locates within cds must not change the reading frame and must not result in any premature stop codon. of note, exonfinder also identifies novel cassette exons flanked by non-canonical splicing sites , although we only considered those flanked by canonical splicing sites for accuracy in the following analysis. to distinguish novel exons from currently-characterized exons, we removed the exons that were supported by ensembl’s annotation or est traces from the target species . of note, for each newly-identified transcript , it must include at least one full-length novel exon and the flanking exons’ segments of the novel exon . it is possible for a novel exon to be assigned to more than one novel asv, in the case of uncertain boundaries of the flanking exons . in addition, a novel asv may also contain multiple novel exons . consequently, we used exonfinder to identify a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   novel asvs  in rice, maize, and sorghum, respectively .table  <dig>

basic properties of the newly-identified exons/asvs
as shown in table  <dig>  most of the identified exons/asvs were supported by multiple est traces, indicating these isoforms might not be rare. in addition, 14% ~ 30% of identified exons/asvs were supported by est traces from at least two non-target species, implying that they were widely expressed in grass plants. since evolutionary conservation implies functional importance  <cit> , these exons/asvs may play an important role in grass plants, rather than random by-products during rna splicing. furthermore, the average length  of the novel cassette exons  were considerably shorter than the average exon length  of previously-annotated exons in rice, maize, and sorghum  <cit> , reflecting a previous observation that conserved alternatively spliced exons tend to be shorter than non-conserved ones  <cit> . next, we retrieved pure introns , and demonstrated that the average and median lengths of pure introns were significantly shorter than other known introns that contain the novel cassette exons . this trends hold well across rice, maize, and sorghum, consistent with a previous observation that cassette exons tend to be flanked by longer introns than constitutively spliced exons  <cit> .table  <dig>

we found that exonfinder identified much more novel asvs in maize and sorghum  than in rice . this was not unexpected, as the annotation of rice genome was more comprehensive than those of maize and sorghum. in addition, the number of exons identified by exonfinder is related not only to the number of available est traces but also to the level of divergence between the target and subject species. according to earlier phylogenetic analyses  <cit> , the nine grass plants examined in this study can be classified into three groups: ehrhartoideae , pooideae , and panicoideae , indicating a closer relationship between ehrhartoideae and pooideae . in rice, the percentages of novel asvs identified from non-rice grass plants were generally positively correlated with the quantities of pooideae and panicoideae est traces, respectively . however, the percentages of novel asvs identified from pooideae est traces tended to be higher than those identified from panicoideae est traces. this tendency might reflect that the level of divergence between ehrhartoideae  and pooideae is lower than that between ehrhartoideae and panicoideae . for example, although the number of est traces of maize  is larger than that of wheat , both data sets were used to identify similar percentages of novel exons in rice . on the other hand, exonfinder using pooideae est traces tended to identify fewer novel maize/sorghum exons  than that using panicoideae est traces, even though est traces from pooideae  are about five times more than those from panicoideae . this indicates that exonfinder is particularly powerful in the identification of novel exons/asvs in poorly annotated species by using closely related species with abundant est traces.figure  <dig>

newly-identified exons tend to have higher dn values and lower ds values than their flanking exons
to investigate the selection pressures imposed on the novel exons identified by comparative analysis of cross-species est libraries, we calculated the evolutionary rates  based on the alignments between the identified asvs  in the target species and their corresponding est sequences in the subject species . since the novel exons are absent in the annotation  of the target species, the inclusion level  should be lower for the novel exons than for their corresponding flanking exons. previous studies have demonstrated that alternatively spliced exons have higher dn and dn/ds values, but lower ds values, than constitutively spliced exons, and that the inclusion level of exons is negatively correlated with dn and dn/ds values, but positively correlated with ds values  <cit> . therefore, we reasoned that the novel exons should exhibit higher dn and dn/ds values, but lower ds values, than their corresponding flanking exons. to test this hypothesis, we concatenated the flanking exons of each novel exon, and then calculated the evolutionary rates of the novel exon and its flanking exons, respectively . after that, we calculated the differences of dn, ds, and dn/ds values between each novel exon and its corresponding concatenated flanking exons. as expected, the differences in average evolutionary rates between novel exons and their flanking exons were higher than zero for dn and dn/ds, but lower than zero for ds , indicating that the novel exons had higher dn and dn/ds values, but lower ds values, than their flanking exons. this result suggested that the novel exons were subjected to weaker selection pressure than their flanking exons at the protein level , but the trend was reversed at the rna level , consistent with our hypothesis.figure  <dig>

interestingly, although the trend that the majority of novel exons  have higher dn values or lower ds values than their corresponding flanking exons was observed in rice, maize, and sorghum, only less than 50% of cases showed significant differences in dn or ds between these two types of exons  . in other words, a considerable proportion of novel exons do not exhibit significant difference in evolutionary patterns as compared to their flanking exons. there are two possible scenarios for this consequence. first, the novel exon also represents a novel as events. there may be some undetected transcript isoforms that include the novel exon, but exclude one or two of their flanking exons, resulting in the inclusion level of the novel exon being higher than or equal to those of its flanking exons. second, the novel exon does not represent an as event , while the previously-annotated one that excludes the novel exon may be subject to erroneous prediction. relatively, it is more important to examine these potentially erroneous predictions.

certain previously-annotated isoforms remain non-evident by the existing transcript sequences
taking rice as example, we then proceeded to confirm the authenticity of the newly-identified asvs  and the previously-annotated asvs . since the novel exons/asvs identified here were based on the ensembl annotation, we randomly selected  <dig> newly-identified asvs and performed rt-pcr-sequencing experiments to examine their authenticity on a rice cultivar . the result showed that  <dig> of them  were detected in japonica , supporting the effectiveness of exonfinder. intriguingly, while  <dig> novel as isoforms were experimentally validated, more than half  of their previously-annotated isoforms were not detected . we examined the alignments between rice est traces  and the reference genome, and confirmed that no rice est supported these previously-annotated isoforms. we further blast-aligned these previously-annotated transcript isoforms against the ncbi non-redundant database  and showed the absences of their homologous expressed sequences within other grass species. these results indicated that the previously-annotated isoforms were likely to be false positives. however, we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that these transcript isoforms are just absent in japonica, but are present in other cultivated or wild rice. to test this possibility, we attempted to detect these  <dig> newly-identified asvs and their previously-annotated asvs in other two cultivars  and two wild species  . our results revealed that the  <dig> novel isoforms were steadily detected in all of the rice species examined, but the previously-annotated isoforms that were not detected in japonica were also absent in other rice species examined . these results support that certain previously-annotated asvs may be subject to erroneous prediction. in fact, except for os06g <dig>  all the previously-annotated isoforms that were not detected in our experiments have not included in the mostly updated version of the ensembl annotation . of note, the three newly-identified asvs that could not be detected in japonica were also absent in the other rice species examined . although it is possible that these exons might be lost in rice and became pure introns during evolution, we observed that two of them  had a dn/ds ratio significantly smaller than  <dig> . this indicates that these two newly-identified exons are subject to much stronger selective constrains on nonsynonymous changes than on synonymous ones  <cit> , suggesting that they are more likely to be protein-coding exons.figure  <dig>

of the  <dig> experimentally-confirmed novel exons,  <dig> locate within cds regions . we observed that five exhibited significantly higher dn values or significantly lower ds values than their flanking exons, four of which were validated to be alternatively spliced . in contrast, the novel exons that exhibited neither higher dn values nor lower ds values than their flanking exons were not validated to be alternatively spliced . this observation is consistent with the overall trend towards higher dn and lower ds values in alternatively spliced  exons as compared to constitutively spliced  exons, further suggesting that our evolutionary analysis is helpful for determining whether a newly-identified exon undergoes as.

implications of newly-identified asvs for evolutionary studies
according to our experimental validation, there were six genes  in which the previously-annotated isoforms that exclude the novel exons  and newly-identified isoforms that include the novel exons  were steadily detected in all rice species examined . since both asv <dig> and asv <dig> were detected in asian cultivated/wild rice and african cultivated rice, we hypothesized that both isoforms for each of the six genes might have been present in the common ancestral transcriptome of african and asian rice species. moreover, since the novel exons were derived from comparative analysis of non-rice est traces, we speculated that asv <dig> might also represent a common ancestral isoform of grass plants. as for asv <dig>  there are two possible scenarios. first, both asv <dig> and asv <dig> might be present in the common ancestral transcriptome of grass plants, inferring that the novel exons exhibited alternatively spliced exons  in both rice and other grass plants  . this implies that both as isoforms are functionally important across grass plants. second, asv <dig> might represent a gain-of-asv event that occurred after the divergence between rice and non-rice plants, inferring that the novel exons were constitutively spliced exons  in the common ancestral transcriptome of grass plants  . this implies that asv <dig> may play a lineage-specific role in rice. our previous study has showed that the ds values of conserved ases were markedly lower than those of both lineage-specific ases and cses  <cit> , providing a possible way to examine whether the novel exons are conserved ases. to this end, on the basis of the rice-maize-sorghum orthologues  and the phylogenetic context of these three species, we calculated the evolutionary rates of the rice transcript sequences and their orthologous sequences derived from the rice-maize-sorghum common ancestor using the codeml program of paml  <cit> . as shown in figure 5c, the ds values of the novel exons were lower by three-fold or more compared with those of their flanking exons for os08g <dig>  os01g <dig>  and os11g <dig>  suggesting that the novel exons were subjected to be alternatively spliced in the rice-maize-sorghum common ancestral transcriptome. meanwhile, for os05g <dig> and os07g <dig>  the ds values of the novel exons were greater or insignificantly lower than those of their flanking exons , inferring that the novel exons might be lineage- or rice-specific ases. of note, os04g <dig> was not considered due to the lack of the information of orthologues. we further aligned asv1/asv <dig> against currently-available non-rice transcripts and found that non-rice transcript evidence supported both asv <dig> and asv <dig> in os08g <dig>  os01g <dig>  and os11g <dig>  while non-rice evidence only supported asv <dig> in os05g <dig> and os07g <dig> . this result also supported the above speculation.figure  <dig>

in summary, the above examples illustrate that the identified asvs can serve a source for inferring the ancestral transcriptomes of rice and other grass plants. if the newly-identified asvs  were not considered in either of the above scenarios, one might speculate that asv <dig> had been lost in rice, and the interpretation of transcriptome evolution could be incomplete or even misleading. the asvs that were inferred from such a comparative analysis of cross-species est library therefore provide new insights into evolutionary transcriptomic studies.

implications of distinct asvs for analysis of expression divergence
we then probed expression divergence of distinct asvs  among the five rice species examined. we analyzed the expression profiles of asv <dig> and asv <dig> for os08g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os11g <dig>  and os07g <dig> by qrt-pcr . of note, os04g <dig> was not considered here because of difficulties in generating suitable primers for qrt-pcr. two intriguing observations were made. first, asv <dig> and asv <dig> exhibited significantly different expression levels for all five genes in all rice species examined , suggesting that these two distinct as isoforms might play different functional roles. importantly, for os05g <dig>  os11g <dig>  and os07g <dig>  the expression levels of asv <dig> were remarkably higher than those of asv <dig> in all rice species examined, indicating that the newly-identified isoforms  predominated over their previously-annotated counterparts  for these genes. second, the trend that asv <dig> was more highly expressed than asv <dig> for os08g <dig> and os01g <dig> but the reverse was true for os05g <dig>  os11g <dig>  and os07g <dig> was observed in all five rice species examined . these results suggested that such asv <dig> and asv <dig> expression profiles for the five genes were present in the ancestral transcriptome before the domestication of asian/african rice. since o. sativa  and o. glaberrima  have independent histories of domestication  <cit> , maintenance of such expression profiles may be of great importance during the domestication and evolution of rice transcriptome.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we described an in silico pipeline exonfinder to identify novel exons/asvs based on comparative analysis of cross-species est library. using exonfinder we identified  <dig>  asvs with  <dig>  novel exons  that were previously unannotated in rice, maize, and sorghum. rt-pcr-sequencing confirmed the authenticity of 81% of the tested asvs, supporting the effectiveness of the exonfinder pipeline. cross-species conservation of these exons/asvs implies their biological importance and functional properties. in addition, a considerable proportion of newly-identified exons have no significant difference in evolutionary rates as compared to their flanking exons, suggesting that these novel exons and their flanking partners tend to co-occur in the transcripts . while  <dig> novel asvs were experimentally validated, 54% of their corresponding previously-annotated asvs were not detected . such results were consistent across multiple rice species including cultivated and wild rice species . this reveals that some of the previous annotations might be subject to erroneous prediction. these observations also indicate the capability and usefulness of exonfinder for the curation and improvement of current plant genome annotations.

regarding as patterns, intron-retention events were observed to be the most prevalent as event in plants such as rice and arabidopsis, contributing to a higher proportion of all asvs than cassette exons  <cit> . however, exonfinder identified fewer retained introns than cassette exons . there are several possibilities. first, the majority of retained introns are subject to nonsense-mediated mrna decay  <cit> , which tend to locate at the 3′ terminal of transcripts. exonfinder was designed for the accurate identification of internal exons, resulting in the limitation for the detection of exons close to the terminal of transcripts. this property also accounts for the observation that the number of utr exons identified by exonfinder is smaller than that of cds exons . second, most of the retained introns in rice were supported by rice est traces, and therefore were removed during the examination of exon novelty. in fact, before this examination, the number of identified retained introns  was much larger than that of identified cassette exons  . third, a substantial number of retained introns may be derived from spurious est traces, such as genomic dna contamination and incompletely-processed transcripts  <cit> .

exonfinder has the capability to identify “full-length” novel exons with cross-species est evidence. for novel cassette exons, each identified asv must have at least one est from other species to support the corresponding exon-intron boundaries and two previously-annotated flanking exons . for novel retained introns, exonfinder requires est evidence from other species to support the corresponding region along with the flanking exons . we also demonstrated that exonfinder is capable of inferring gain- and loss-of-asv events, which may be valuable for evolutionary studies in the era of transcriptomics. although the lack of an adequate quantity of est traces in many plant species may hamper such a comparative transcriptome analysis, the rapid progress in high-throughput rna sequencing  technologies can provide alternative resources for this task. for example, transcript assemblers  can subsequently be used to generate preliminary multiple-exon transcript segments based on integration of long  and short  rna-seq reads  <cit> . in this regard, exonfinder can make a knowledge-based complement to these strategies, by revising the transcriptome annotation through the lens of cross-species comparative analysis.

for accuracy, exonfinder does not consider the candidates that change the reading frame of the corresponding transcript or result in premature stop codons; however, some of these exons may be fragments of non-coding rnas that are expressed in the target species. for example, we showed an exon candidate that resulted in a premature stop codon was experimentally-validated in multiple rice cultivars and wild species , suggesting that this exon might be of biological significance in rice transcriptome. thus, it is also possible to utilize exonfinder to identify non-coding rnas with cross-species conservations. moreover, we showed that evolutionary rates might serve as an indicator for determining whether the identified exons were alternatively spliced. integration of comparative analysis  and evolutionary analysis  may enable the accurate identification of novel as events by using publicly-available est traces, without requiring costly experiments. in conclusion, this study not only presents an in silico pipeline for accurate identification of novel exons/asvs, but also expands the discovery of as events in the evolution of plant transcriptomes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a computational pipeline  to identify previously-unannotated exons and asvs using cross-species est-to-genome comparisons. rt-pcr-sequencing confirmed 81% of the tested exons/asvs, supporting the effectiveness of our in silico strategy. exonfinder thus reannotated the rice, maize, and sorghum genomes, and identified many novel exons/asvs that are cross-species conserved in grass plant ests. evolutionary analysis further revealed the consistency of evolutionary rates between certain novel exons and their flanking exons, which provided evidence of their co-occurrence in the transcripts, suggesting that previously-annotated isoforms might be subject to erroneous predictions. this also indicated that evolutionary rates might serve as an indicator for determining whether the identified exons were alternatively spliced. moreover, comparative analyses inferred the common ancestral transcriptome of grass plants and gain- and loss-of-asv events, providing important targets for evolutionary and functional studies. exonfinder can be applied to comparative analysis of other model organisms.
