BACKGROUND
barley  is rated as a salt-tolerant member of the tribe triticeae on the basis of grain yield in saline environments  <cit> . salt tolerance in triticeae is generally associated with na+ ion exclusion during growth under saline conditions  <cit> . considerable genetic variation exists in salt tolerance with respect to na+ ion exclusion in barley as well as in triticeae in general. barley cultivar, golden promise was reported to be a gamma-ray induced mutant of cultivar maythorpe  <cit> . golden promise was selected for its desirable agronomic traits such as short stature and earliness, and became a popular malting variety. it was later discovered that golden promise also has a more effective na+ exclusion than maythorpe in a salt tolerance screening experiment conducted at the scottish crop research institute  <cit> . golden promise accumulates lower na+ in shoot tissue compared to maythorpe under high salt conditions. this ion exclusion was later characterized to be na+ specific. golden promise produced higher number of seeds per plant and fewer sterile seeds than maythorpe when exposed to salt stress  <cit> .

besides ion exclusion, other phenotypes which distinguish the mutant were a short stiff straw, semi dwarf stature, a compact inflorescence, short awns and early flowering. this phenotype complex has been attributed to a single recessive mutation called gpert that mapped to chromosome  <dig> of barley near the centromere  <cit> . gpert was reported to be the single known locus at which golden promise differed from maythorpe  <cit>  based on lack of polymorphism from roughly  <dig> randomly amplified polymorphic dnas . this locus was subsequently shown to be allelic to the ari-e locus also located on 5h  <cit> . the ari-e mutants in different genetic backgrounds were also semi-dwarf in stature and accumulated less na+ than their respective parent genotypes  <cit> .

the golden promise-maythorpe genotypic combination provided an attractive model for understanding salt tolerance in barley at the molecular level. here the progenitor and the presumed single gene mutant differ in salt tolerance as manifested by na+ ion exclusion, coupled with improved yield of the mutant under saline conditions. large-scale transcriptome analysis has been employed previously to gain insight into complex phenomena such as salt stress response  <cit> . the availability of a barley array representing ~ <dig>  transcripts  <cit>  afforded an opportunity to start understanding the differences in transcriptional responses between golden promise and maythorpe and to attempt to identify the genes involved in regulation of salt uptake. microarray technology has been used in the past to map mutant genes such as early flowering  <dig>  and asymmetric leaves  <dig>  in arabidopsis using the whole genome arrays  <cit> . the affymetrix barley <dig> genechip is believed to probe roughly half of the genome. therefore if salt tolerance of golden promise has a detectable transcriptional basis, there is a probability of  <dig>  that the salt tolerance gene can be observed using the barley <dig> genechip.

several approaches using molecular markers such as rapds, ssrs and aflp have been used to describe the isogenic relationship between golden promise and maythorpe  <cit> . however, recent advances in detection of polymorphism utilize sequence-based approaches that have a far greater marker density. one such method is the use of arrays to detect single feature polymorphisms . the sfp approach can derive genotypes as a by-product of expression analysis, detecting genetic polymorphism  within the transcribed sequences queried by the array. such an approach has been used in several organisms including barley, arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . another recent advance has been the development of a barley snp-based genetic map using the illumina golden gate assay  <cit> . this high throughput approach combines high-density beadarray technology with allele-specific extension covering the polymorphic loci  <cit> . this technology can be used to scan in parallel roughly  <dig> known snp loci across multiple genotypes. in this study we couple high-density genotyping with differential expression analysis to investigate the basis of salt tolerance of golden promise.

RESULTS
sfp analysis for variation between golden promise and maythorpe
the level of polymorphism between golden promise and maythorpe was investigated using the robustified projection pursuit method of sfp analysis which has a validation rate above 80%  <cit> . based on a p-value cut-off of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> sfp probe sets were detected from the shoot and root datasets, respectively. the rice orthologs of the barley shoot sfp probe sets were mapped using blast and are displayed in figure  <dig>  several of the rice orthologs are concentrated within two distinct segments of the rice genome. one is an eleven gene cluster  on short arm of chromosome  <dig> of rice, which is syntenic to barley chromosome 4h. likewise, a four gene cluster  was found on the rice chromosome  <dig> , which is syntenic with barley chromosome 1h. details of shoot sfps whose rice orthologs resolved into these two clusters are shown in table  <dig>  the complete list of sfp probe sets along with the outlying score and position of the sfp probes, and the probe set annotations from harvest:barley are available as supplemental data . sfp analysis of golden promise versus maythorpe revealed a low level of polymorphism overall when compared with the other barley genotype comparisons reported in  <cit> . this is consistent with golden promise and maythorpe being very closely related genetically. however, the sfp analysis established that maythorpe and golden promise differ by more than a single mutation.

snp polymorphisms between golden promise and maythorpe
to more fully gauge the level of polymorphism between golden promise and maythorpe the illumina opa genotyping assay was employed. this assay was set-up using  <dig> barley snps as described in  <cit> . each snp included in the assay has a corresponding "unigene" in harvest:barley derived from assembly  <dig>  <cit> . of the  <dig> loci,  <dig> were used to generate a barley genetic map. among these mapped snps  <dig> loci were identified as polymorphic between golden promise and maythorpe. these loci, their corresponding unigenes, and functional annotations found using unigene sequences are listed in table  <dig>  two of these loci map to 5h, separted by  <dig> cm. these two loci on 5h are about  <dig> cm from the ari-e locus. seven cluster to a  <dig>  cm region of 4h spanning the centromere. the other five loci are within a  <dig>  cm cluster on the distal end of the long arm of 1h. the clusters of snps on 1h and 4h correspond to the regions identified by sfp analysis, even including some of the same barley genes identified as sfp probe sets. all fourteen snp loci and their corresponding rice orthologs are displayed in figure  <dig> 

genotype comparisons at transcriptome level
to identify differentially expressed genes between golden promise and maythorpe the crown and growing point tissue and the root tips were sampled from both genotypes growing under control and salinity stressed conditions for transcriptome analysis. the crown and growing point tissue consists of meristematic cells and green growing point obtained by removing the sheath tissue. the term "shoot tissue" is used in this manuscript to describe the crown and growing point tissue. the statistical analysis for differential expression was performed with significance analysis of microarray  software  <cit>  using three independent biological replicates. genes that were differentially regulated between the genotypes  <dig> days after germination are listed in table  <dig>  nine probe sets were differentially expressed in shoot tissue at a q-value cut-off of 10% . at the same threshold no differentially expressed probe set in the roots were found. however, fifteen differentially expressed probe sets were identified in roots at a 25% q-value threshold . three probe sets were shared between the shoot and root comparisons. these include a late embryogenesis protein  and a protein with a cct  motif up-regulated in maythorpe, and contig6845_at expressing at a higher level in golden promise. probe set contig6845_at has no sequence match to a known gene. the consensus sequence for this probe set is derived from cdnas from four different barley genotypes including golden promise, providing confidence that it is indeed a barley gene.

since the phenotypic differences between maythorpe and golden promise were pleiotropic, it was important to ascertain how early in seedling development the difference between the two cultivars at expression level becomes apparent. therefore the shoot tissue of 10-day old seedlings growing under unstressed conditions from golden promise and maythorpe were sampled for an unreplicated expression analysis experiment. at a two-fold cut-off level,  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed. at a more relaxed cut-off of  <dig> -fold,  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed between the two genotypes. it was observed that seven of the nine probe sets identified from shoot analysis in a fully replicated experiment  were also in this list of  <dig> probe sets. these probe sets are denoted with y for young shoot analysis in table  <dig> 

the genotypic array analysis was extended by using the barley microarray reference dataset  <cit> . this dataset was generated from two barley genotypes, morex and golden promise, using a diverse series of tissues and is available from plant expression database . the rationale for looking at the golden promise-morex data was that any expression difference observed between golden promise and maythorpe due to gamma-ray treatment is also likely to emerge from a comparison of golden promise with other genotypes including morex. a genotypic comparison of golden promise with morex yielded  <dig> probe sets as differentially expressed when comparing the same tissue types as in this study. stringent statistical analysis using sam was also employed on this triplicate dataset for differential expression. on comparing the golden promise-morex probe set list to the golden promise-maythorpe list in table  <dig>  six of the nine probe sets identified in the shoot maythorpe-golden promise comparison were found in common with morex-golden promise comparison . six of the  <dig> probe sets identified from the maythorpe-golden promise root tissue comparison were also identified in the golden promise-morex comparison. these probe sets which were derived from intersection of two genotypic comparisons constitute a more robust list of genes for differential expression in golden promise than would a list derived from only the golden promise-maythorpe comparison.

since the gpert mutation in golden promise was previously mapped to barley chromosome 5h as an allele of the ari-e locus  <cit> , we initially used wheat-barley addition line for 5h  <cit>  to determine if any of the regulated genes identified from array analysis map to 5h. six genes encoding lea protein, cct motif family protein, hua <dig>  replication protein a , catalase <dig> and auxin response factor  from table  <dig> were selected. selection of these genes was based on their identification from two or more expression-based genotypic comparisons involving 10-day and 25-day golden promise-maythorpe comparisons and the golden promise-morex comparisons. the 5h addition line consists of disomic 5h from betzes barley in the chinese spring hexaploid wheat background . none of these genes mapped on 5h, consistent with sfp and snp analysis. furthermore, size polymorphisms in the amplicons for cct motif protein, and catalase <dig> and a missing band for maythorpe  in the case of arf <dig> were detected. these amplicon size polymorphisms indicated that these three genes were not only differentially expressed but were in different allelic forms in the two genotypes. the difference in expression for cct motif protein and catalase <dig> was validated with semi-quantitative rt-pcr .

differential expression in response to salinity stress
how different are the salinity stress responses of two genotypes which are genetically very similar but differ in salt-tolerance? how do the transcriptional responses of roots compare to those of shoot under salinity stress for a given genotype? to address these questions, the shoot and root samples from control and stressed conditions at 25-day time point from golden promise and maythorpe were compared. differential expression analysis was performed using sam and the false discovery rate  was controlled to be below 15%. lists of differentially expressed genes in response to salinity stress observed in golden promise and maythorpe are provided as additional files . the number of probe sets responding significantly to salinity treatment for each of the genotype and tissue combinations is shown in figure 5a. the results show that a higher number of genes are salt stress regulated in the roots compared to the shoot tissue in both genotypes. additionally, roots in both genotypes responded by down-regulation of more genes than by up-regulation. the salinity stress response of golden promise is significantly different compared to maythorpe . this difference is more apparent in the root comparisons.

these results indicate that the response of roots to salinity stress at the transcriptional level is very different from the shoots in both genotypes. only  <dig> and  <dig> probe sets were found to be commonly induced between roots and shoots in golden promise and maythorpe, respectively. of these,  <dig> probe sets were induced in the roots and shoot tissue of both genotypes. the probe sets represent delta-l-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase, a lipid transfer protein, phosphoethanolamine cytidyltransferase and barley dehydrin  <dig>  three of these genes are associated with abiotic stress response in plants.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
genetic polymorphism between golden promise and maythorpe
the results presented clearly show that golden promise and maythorpe are polymorphic at multiple loci. fourteen polymorphic snp loci resolve into three clusters on 1h, 4h and 5h , two of which  were also found by sfp analysis  and by the position of loci with amplicon size polymorphisms . these two genotypes were previously reported to be isogenic differing at a single locus, gpert on 5h  <cit> . certainly this is not the only difference between the accessions of maythorpe and golden promise that we analyzed. a different accession of maythorpe with a slightly different genetic constitution, reflecting residual polymorphism within the cultivar, probably was used as the parent of golden promise. the polymorphism on 5h is at about  <dig> cm distance from the ari-e locus, so the presence of this 5h haplotype block in the accession of maythorpe that was examined is still consistent with a mutational origination of golden promise from maythorpe.

none of the probe sets representing the  <dig> snp loci were found to be differentially expressed in the genotypic comparisons in both tissue types. additionally, the  <dig> probe sets were found to not respond to salt stress in the two genotypes. some of the rice orthologs of barley probe sets identified as differentially expressed in genotypic comparisons localized in the vicinity of polymorphic haploblocks . seven polymorphic snp loci between golden promise and maythorpe clustered around the 4h centromere and  <dig> of these corresponded to an orthologous rice region spanning  <dig>  mb of chromosome  <dig>  two loci  were found to be differentially expressed from the genechip analysis. the segment on the long arm of 1h and its corresponding rice chromosome  <dig> segment  also emerged as different between golden promise and maythorpe. this segment includes the rice orthologs of the cct motif protein and the lea protein besides an aaa-type atpase. both cct and lea protein encoding genes were the only two genes consistently identified from differential expression analysis involving golden promise, maythorpe and morex in all tissue types and stages. the differential expression of aaa-type atpase is important in context of a recent report which characterized an ice plant aaa-type atpase gene, skd <dig> and suggested a role in compartmentalization of excess na+  <cit> .

golden promise phenotype and regulated genes
the genes identified by the genotypic analyses performed in this study  do not have an obvious functional association with the favorable na+ homeostasis maintained by golden promise. no known na+ transporters conferring this trait were identified. two possible explanations can be proposed for this: 1) some of the genes/loci identified have no annotation, or have sequence match to an uncharacterized expressed protein; these uncharacterized genes could be regulating ion homeostasis 2) the barley <dig> genechip does not probe the transcript which can be directly associated with favorable ion homeostasis in golden promise. all the expression and polymorphism based approaches used in this study are directly or indirectly derived from the est sequence assembly probed by the barley <dig> genechip. our analysis did not query every gene in barley genome.

low na+ accumulation has been associated with early flowering genes in triticeae  <cit> . it is noteworthy that golden promise was reported to flower earlier than maythorpe  <cit> . early flowering in golden promise was also observed under our experimental conditions. our expression analysis identified a gene with cct motif as differentially expressed between golden promise and maythorpe. the cct motif is present in several genes known to regulate flowering time  <cit> . it raises the possibility of the cct motif belonging to a repressor of flowering, which is down-regulated in golden promise. two other genes which emerged from the expression analysis are known regulators of inflorescence/flower architecture. first is hua <dig> which is up-regulated in golden promise in young, 10-day as well as 25-day old plants in the shoot tissue. hua <dig> is an rna binding protein which is involved in flower development in arabidopsis  <cit> . the second gene encodes an auxin response factor  <dig> . a mutation in arf <dig> in arabidopsis is known to result in pleiotropic effects on the phenotype  <cit> . the arf <dig> mutants are reported to have increased seed size and larger aerial organs, delayed flowering and leaf senescence among other phenotypes.

intriguingly, some of the phenotypes distinguishing golden promise from maythorpe include small seed size, and decreased plant height, compact inflorescence and early flowering  <cit> . it is pertinent to point out that none of these three genes map to chromosome 5h of barley where the original mutation  is mapped. therefore, if these genes control the observed phenotypes such as flowering time difference and seed size variation, then the differences cannot be attributed to ari-e locus on 5h.

differential response to salinity stress
considering the genetic difference between maythorpe and golden promise in regulation of shoot na+ homeostasis under salt stress, we found the differential expression of two cation transport related genes to be particularly interesting. a na+/ca2+ exchanger protein  was down-regulated in maythorpe roots in response to salinity stress . supplemental ca2+ is known to reduce na+ influx in plant  <cit> . the down-regulation of the na+/ca2+ exchanger in maythorpe but not in golden promise may explain the low na+ accumulation trait of golden promise as well as the supplemental ca2+-linked na+ efflux reported by several researchers. another gene with a similar expression profile encodes a vacuolar cation/proton exchanger . this gene has a sequence match in arabidopsis database to a calcium proton antiporter, cax <dig>  it is a ca2+ exchanger predominantly active in root tonoplasts and is required for growth and nutrient acquisition  <cit> .

jasmonic acid  related genes were differently regulated in the two genotypes. several of the ja biosynthetic pathway genes were down-regulated in response to salinity in maythorpe. these included 12-oxophytodienoate reductase  <dig> , allene oxide synthase , and lipoxygenases . in contrast, biosynthesis gene allene oxide cyclase  and two jasmonic acid-induced proteins  were up-regulated in golden promise but not in maythorpe in response to stress . the allene oxide synthase  gene represented by contig3097_at  on the array was found to have an sfp  between golden promise and maythorpe. interestingly, this gene maps to the haploblock on 4h at  <dig>  cm. differential regulation of jasmonic acid related genes between the two genotypes can potentially be due polymorphism at the aos gene which lies on the 4h haploblock. it has been reported previously that ja-pretreatment improves salinity stress adaptation in barley  <cit> . recent experiments from our laboratories have demonstrated that ja-pretreatment of barley plants before salinity stress induced ja biosynthesis genes and improved salt-tolerance by maintaining lower shoot na+ relative to stressed plants with no pretreatment  <cit> . it will be interesting to investigate if the differential regulation of ja-related genes in low na+ accumulating golden promise and association of ja-pretreatment with na+ exclusion is purely coincidental. if not, ja appears to be an important component of heritable salt tolerance in golden promise and barley in general.
