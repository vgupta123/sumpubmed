BACKGROUND
adoptive t-cell immunotherapy involves using ex vivo isolated and expanded autologous or allogeneic tumor-reactive lymphocytes to treat cancer patients. it has been highly effective in treating patients with metastatic melanoma and objective responses have been detected in 50% of patients  <cit> .

since tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with tumor-specific receptors can only be generated from some cancer patients, adoptive t-cell therapy has been improved by introducing antigen receptors into circulating lymphocytes. to do this, genes encoding t-cell receptors isolated from high avidity, tumor-specific t cells or chimeric antigen receptors  containing an antibody-based external receptor structure and intracellular t-cell signaling domains, such as cd3ζ, are introduced into lymphocytes by retroviral or lentiviral vectors. because cars can induce t cells to attack tumors in an mhc-unrestricted manner, the application of adoptive t-cell therapy in cancer treatments has expanded. currently, multiple clinical trials investigating cars that recognize cell surface tumor antigens are underway, including for the treatment of lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, melanoma, and neuroblastoma  <cit> .

cancer stem cells  enable the tumor to grow and metastasize, therefore, eradicating cscs is expected to provide cancer patients long-term disease-free survival. however, cscs have also been demonstrated to be more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy  <cit> . currently, the research on immunotherapies targeting cscs is limited.

in this study, we developed a new adoptive immunotherapy that targets cancer stem cell antigen, epithelial cell adhesion molecule . studies have shown that epcam is expressed on cscs from breast, colon, pancreas, and prostate tumors  <cit> . in breast cancer, epcam+ cd44+ cd24− lineage− cells are  <dig> times more likely to form tumors than the epcam− cd44+ cd24− lineage− population  <cit> . in addition, our previous studies show that epcam+ cells of the human prostate cancer cell line pc <dig> display higher proliferation rates than epcam− or unsorted pc <dig> cells. interestingly, pc3m cells, a highly metastatic clone of pc <dig>  express much higher levels of epcam than pc <dig>  which suggests that epcam expression is associated with the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cells.

in this paper, we show that human peripheral blood lymphocytes  expressing epcam-specific cars can kill pc3m cells in vitro and in vivo. interestingly, despite the low expression level of epcam on pc <dig> cells, lymphocytes targeting epcam can cause significant killing and inhibit the metastasis of pc <dig> cells in nod/scid mice. this indicates that immunotherapies targeting cscs, a small population of cancer cells, could result in distinct anti-tumor effects. our results suggest that adoptive t-cell therapy targeting cscs is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

RESULTS
studies have shown that epcam is expressed on cscs from prostate cancer and its expression is associated with prostate cancer cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemo/radioresistance  <cit> . to verify these findings, we sorted epcam+ and epcam− cells from the pc <dig> cell line and performed a cck- <dig> assay to examine the effect of epcam expression on pc <dig> cell proliferation. epcam+ cells displayed higher proliferation rates than epcam− or unsorted cells . we also compared the expression levels of epcam on pc <dig> and pc3m cells and found that epcam is expressed more on pc3m cells . this suggests that epcam is associated with the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells.figure  <dig> 
epcam expression is associated with the proliferation and metastatic potential of pc <dig> cells. a) the proliferation rates of epcam+, epcam−, and unsorted pc <dig> cells were determined with a cck- <dig> assay. statistical analysis was performed using a two-way anova. b) the expression of epcam on pc <dig> and pc3m cells was determined by staining the cells with a pe-conjugated anti-epcam antibody.



to target epcam, we designed an epcam specific car, which consists of an anti-epcam single chain variable fragment that was derived from the anti-human epcam mouse hybridoma clone c <dig>  <cit> , a portion of human cd <dig>  and the intracellular domain of human cd3ζ . the car was ligated into the retroviral vector plncx. retroviruses were produced using the retrovirus packaging kit, ampho  and the 293 t packaging cell line. the retroviruses were used to transduce human pbls that had been stimulated in culture with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> for  <dig> d. the phenotype of the transduced pbls was analyzed  <dig> d after retrovirus transduction by staining the cells with anti-cd <dig>  anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig> antibodies . cd <dig> and cd <dig> were expressed by  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the transduced cells, respectively. to examine the transduction efficiency, we used protein l to detect the expression of cars on transduced lymphocytes. protein l is an immunoglobulin binding protein that can be used to determine car expression  <cit> . five days after transduction,  <dig> % of pbls expressed the car , which is similar to the transduction efficiency of pbls reported previously  <cit> .figure  <dig>

to investigate if pbls transduced with the epcam-specific car can specifically target epcam+ cells, we compared the cell killing capabilities of pbls on two different, luciferase-expressing tumor cell lines, pc3m with high expression of epcam and hela cells that do not express epcam. the tumor cells were incubated with pbls transduced with either the epcam specific car or control retroviruses. luminescence imaging was conducted 24 h after incubation to examine the cancer cell viability and the results were compared with the luminescence intensity of tumor cells cultured alone. the luminescence was significantly reduced when pc3m cells were cultured with pbls transduced with the epcam-specific car, when compared with the culture with pbls transduced with control retroviruses . no significant difference in luminescence was detected when either pbl was cultured with hela cells. this indicates that pbls transduced with the epcam-specific car can target and kill epcam+ tumor cells. a dose response was also identified for the killing of pc3m cells with pbls expressing epcam-specific cars, with the cytotoxicity detected correlating with the e:t ratio . consistent with the tumor cell killing, pbls expressing epcam-specific cars proliferated when co-cultured with pc3m cells , which suggests that the car-expressing pbls can be activated by pc3m cells.figure  <dig>

to examine the tumor-killing abilities of car-expressing pbls in vivo, we injected pc3m-luc tumor cells into nod/scid mice intraperitoneally. five days later, pbls transduced with the epcam-specific car or control retroviruses were injected intravenously. luminescence imaging was conducted at different time points to analyze the tumor burden within the mice. pbls expressing epcam-specific cars significantly reduced pc3m tumor growth compared with pbls transduced with control retroviruses, which showed no significant difference from the untreated tumor-challenged mice .figure  <dig>

having found that pbls expressing epcam-specific cars can kill pc3m tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, we next aimed to determine if adoptively transferring pbls expressing epcam-specific cars can target cscs. for this purpose, we used pc <dig> as the tumor model, of which only a small population of cells express epcam. luciferase-expressing pc <dig> cells were incubated with epcam-specific or control pbls at different e:t ratios. luminescence imaging was performed to examine the cell viability 24 h later. luminescence detected from the culture was significantly reduced when the tumor cells were cultured with car-expressing pbls, whereas pbls transduced with control retroviruses did not significantly reduce the luminescence . this indicates that pbls targeting epcam are able to perform significant cytotoxic activities against pc <dig> cells and thus may be an effective therapeutic approach for prostate cancer.figure  <dig> 
human pbls transduced with epcam-specific cars kill pc <dig> cells. pbls transduced with the epcam-specific car or control vector were incubated with pc3-luc cells at e:t ratios of 1: <dig> or 2: <dig>  luciferin was added 24 h later and cell viability was determined by luminescence imaging. pc3-luc cells incubated alone were used as controls. statistical analysis was performed using a student’s t-test.



to test this hypothesis, we used a previously established pc <dig> metastasis model. pc3-luc tumor cells were injected into the tail vein of nod/scid mice and 6 h later pbls transduced with epcam-specific cars or control retroviruses were administered intravenously. luminescence imaging was conducted at different times to examine the effect of pbl transfer on pc <dig> metastasis in vivo. tumor metastasis was detected in the lung and bone of mice treated with pbls transduced with control vectors  <dig> d after tumor challenge, whereas almost no luminescence was detected in mice treated with car-expressing pbls . quantitative analysis of luminescence intensity also showed a significant difference between the group treated with car-expressing pbls and the untreated group . in addition, the pc3-bearing mice treated with car-expressing pbls demonstrated prolonged survival compared with mice treated with control pbls or untreated mice . all mice treated with car-expressing pbls were alive 80 days after tumor challenge, whereas only 1/ <dig> of the mice in the two control groups survived. these data indicate that pbls targeting epcam, the cancer stem cell antigen expressed on a small population of tumor cells, can perform significant anti-tumor effects.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we constructed a car targeting the cancer stem cell marker epcam and demonstrated that human pbls transduced with the epcam-specific car can kill the prostate cancer cells pc3m and pc <dig>  both in vitro and in vivo. numerous clinical trials have been performed and are underway to examine the treatment of cancer with the adoptive transfer of tumor-reactive t cells; however, few studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of adoptive t-cell immunotherapy targeting cscs. epcam is a marker that has been detected on cscs from prostate cancer. in our study, we showed that epcam+ pc <dig> cells have higher proliferation rates than epcam− cells. in addition, a more metastatic clone of pc <dig>  pc3m, expresses higher levels of epcam . this suggests that epcam expression is associated with the proliferation and metastatic potential of pc <dig> cells. therefore, despite the low expression of epcam on pc <dig> cells, targeting epcam may cause dramatic tumor-killing effects.

pbls transduced with retroviruses encoding epcam-specific cars displayed significantly increased cytotoxicity against pc3m cells when compared with pbls transduced with control retroviruses . however, control pbls also displayed significant cytotoxic activity against tumor cells relative to the untreated group. this is probably caused by direct recognition between alloreactive t cells from the healthy donors and human leukocyte antigen expressed by tumor cells  <cit> . the recognition between control pbls and tumor cells is also reflected by the proliferation assay , where cell proliferation was detected for the control pbls co-cultured with pc3m cells.

at an e:t ratio of 2: <dig>  pbls expressing epcam-specific cars lysed 73% of pc3m cells, whereas only 32% of pc <dig> cells were lysed . the relatively low level of cytotoxicity detected for pc <dig> cells is probably because of its low expression of epcam. however, considering the association between epcam+ cells and pc <dig> cell proliferation and metastasis, targeting this small population of cells may cause dramatic tumor-killing effects. this is supported by the success of the car-expressing pbls at protecting mice against pc <dig> development. metastatic pc <dig> tumor cells were detected in the lung, peritoneal cavity, and bone of untreated mice and in mice treated with control pbls, whereas treatment with epcam-specific pbls significantly inhibited pc <dig> metastasis and prolonged mouse survival .

the side effects of targeted therapies depend on the expression levels of the target in other tissues. like other csc antigens, epcam expression is not restricted to cscs. as a cell adhesion molecule, epcam is expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues, which raises the concern that targeting epcam may lead to toxicity. toxicity has been observed in several car trials, such as when targeting her2/neu in colorectal cancer  <cit> , or cd <dig> in b-cell malignancies  <cit> . one possible way to reduce acute toxicity by car transuded t cells is to administer multiple small doses of t cells rather than one large dose. another possibility is to insert suicide genes into the car, which enables the t cells to be deleted when severe toxicity is observed. it is possible that with a better understanding of epcam and its function in cancer cells and cscs, a component of epcam signaling may be identified that will provide a better and more specific target for cancer therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that the adoptive transfer of human pbls with cars specific for epcam can cause pc3m tumor cell killing in vitro and in vivo. despite the low expression of epcam on pc <dig> tumor cells, epcam-specific pbls had significant anti-tumor activity against pc <dig>  probably by targeting the cscs of prostate cancer. our data suggest that adoptive transfer of t cells targeting csc antigens is a promising therapeutic approach for treating cancer.
