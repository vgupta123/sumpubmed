BACKGROUND
previous studies have demonstrated that chronic administration of β-adrenoceptor  agonists  can increase myofibrillar protein content and thus induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mammals  <cit> . this β2-ar induced hypertrophy is believed to be a result of decreased proteolysis coupled with increased protein synthesis  <cit> . the ubiquitin-proteasome signaling  <cit> , ca2+-dependent proteolysis  <cit>  and/or calpain-mediated proteolysis  <cit>  have all been proposed to play a role, however the molecular and cellular pathways altered following β-ar agonist administration remain poorly understood  <cit> .

in addition to hypertrophy, acute exposure of skeletal muscle  to β-ar agonists has been found to modulate oxidative metabolism, energy expenditure, lipolysis  <cit> , glucose transport  <cit> , and glucose oxidation  <cit> . skeletal muscle accounts for a large proportion of the body's energy demand and thus plays a pivotal role in insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile and energy balance  <cit> .

underscoring the importance of β-ar signaling in regulating metabolism, transgenic mice lacking all three β-ars are susceptible to diet-induced obesity. these animals lack any diet- and cold-induced thermogenic response, indicating that β-ars play a major role in energy expenditure  <cit> . similar to the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle hypertrophy, our understanding of the pathways regulating the metabolic response to β-ar stimulation have yet to be fully elucidated.

in the context of β-ar signaling and skeletal muscle, we  have previously demonstrated that acute β-ar signaling markedly and transiently increased the expression of the nr4a subgroup of orphan nuclear receptors  in skeletal muscle tissue and cultures  <cit> . the induction of the nr4a subgroup was associated with the modulation of critical metabolic genes and cellular metabolism  <cit>   and chronic  effects of β2-ar agonist administration. we identified changes in the expression of mrnas encoding genes associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy, myoblast differentiation, metabolism, circadian rhythm, transcription, histones, and oxidative stress that occur within  <dig> hours and alter signaling pathways responsible for the long-term phenotypic footprint of b2-ar activation.

RESULTS
acute systemic administration of the β2-adreneroreceptor agonist, formoterol, induces widespread changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle
the entire data set is available via gene expression omnibus . expression profiling was performed on  <dig> mice in total using 46k illumina sentrix beadarray chips. skeletal muscle samples from  <dig> independent animals were removed at  <dig> and  <dig> hours following a single i.p. injection of the β2-ar agonist, formoterol, or saline . each timepoint consisted of eight animals with four saline and four formoterol treated animals. the tibialis anterior muscle was chosen for all analyses as it contains predominantly type ii fibers, and  is known to exhibit marked increases in protein content and lean mass  in response to β-ar agonist administration  <cit> .

using a p value cutoff of p <  <dig>   and a fold change cutoff of  <dig> , at one hour following formoterol administration,  <dig> probes were significantly altered and  <dig> probes were significantly altered at four hours. significant annotated genes from both timepoints are shown in table  <dig>  significant non-annotated genes  are included in table  <dig> 

functional categorization of genes differentially regulated by β2-ar activation
genes presented in table  <dig> were grouped according to their potential relevant function in skeletal muscle. the potential relevant function is based on the authors' opinion gained from a combination of illumina gene ontology classifications, ingenuity pathway analysis , online mendelian inheritance in man , and aceview  searches. the illumina beadarray expression analysis revealed significant changes in the expression of genes in several functional categories at  <dig> and  <dig> hours following formoterol administration, including genes involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy/growth, myoblast differentiation, metabolism, circadian rhythm, transcription, histones, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, solute carriers, apoptosis, cell cycle, cancer, dna repair, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

validation of differential gene expression by quantitative rt-pcr
the expression of  <dig> genes  that were identified as differentially expressed by illumina beadarray analysis  and associated with the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, circadian rhythm and metabolism were validated and examined in greater detail following acute  and chronic  formoterol administration via quantitative rt-pcr . all qrt-pcr analyses were performed on an independent/different set of formoterol treated mice  than the group used in the illumina beadarray study. all  <dig> gene analyzed by qrt-pcr on independent animals closely mirrored the illumina changes at both timepoints, highlighting the robust nature of the illumina platform.

formoterol administration alters the expression of genes associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy and differentiation: attenuation of myostatin signaling
several differentially expressed genes associated with the regulation of muscle differentiation and mass  were examined over an acute and chronic time course of formoterol administration using qrt-pcr. in addition we also examined the expression of myostatin and the myostatin receptor, activin receptor iib  that are critical modulators of muscle mass. we examined these genes using qrt-pcr as acvr2b was down-regulated at  <dig> hour in the illumina beadarray, however it did not pass statistical analysis . tibialis anterior muscle was isolated from groups  of male mice, treated with either the specific β2-ar agonist treatment or saline  and assayed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post treatment. significant changes in expression at one or more timepoints were observed in the mrnas encoding signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , inhibitor of dna binding  <dig> , small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog  <dig> , acvr2b , and small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog  <dig> . we did not observe any significant changes in myostatin expression, after acute β2-ar agonist treatment 

to examine chronic changes induced by formoterol administration, qrt-pcr was used to examine expression of genes from chronically treated mice . similar to acute timepoints, tibialis anterior was isolated from groups  of male mice, treated daily with either the specific β2-ar agonist formoterol or saline  and assayed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of treatment. chronic formoterol administration was associated with a significant attenuation in the expression of the mrnas encoding idb <dig> , smad <dig>  and myostatin  after  <dig> or  <dig> days. no significant changes were observed following chronic formoterol administration in the expression of the mrnas encoding stat <dig> , smad <dig> , and acvr2b , despite significant repression following acute formoterol administration.

to examine the effect of chronic β2-ar agonist treatment on critical regulators of the myostatin signaling pathway we examined the levels of the myostatin precursor , smad <dig>  phosphorylated smad <dig> relative to gapdh. we assayed levels by western blotting analysis of tibialis anterior muscle  following  <dig> days of formoterol/saline administration in four animals for each treatment . consistent with the qrt-pcr data, at the protein level, pro-myostatin appears subtley  suppressed following  <dig> days of formoterol administration. in concordance, the levels of smad <dig> phosphorylation following the chronic formoterol administration are also reduced , while total smad <dig> appears unchanged.

in summary, β2-adrenergic stimulation mediates changes in the expression of several genes associated with myostatin signaling, and the regulation of muscle mass .

formoterol administration alters the expression of genes associated with metabolism and circadian rhythm
many genes that regulate and/or are directly involved in metabolism are regulated in a circadian manner. the illumina beadarray study identified differential expression of several genes involved in these pathways. consequently, we utilized qrt-pcr to validate the differential expression of these genes after acute or chronic administration of fomoterol  in tibialis anterior as detailed above. significant expression changes at one or more timepoints were observed in several genes involved in metabolism, including, hexokinase  <dig> , pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase  <dig> , sorbin and sh <dig> domain containing  <dig> , pparγ coactivator  <dig> alpha , lipin1α ; forkhead box o <dig> , and uncoupling protein  <dig> . in the context of crosstalk between β-ar signaling and nor- <dig>  signaling in skeletal muscle, we have previously identified and examined the induction of pdk <dig>  pgc1α, foxo <dig>  and lipin1α over following acute β-ar activation  <cit> .

chronic formoterol administration significantly altered the expression of foxo <dig>  and ucp <dig>  at  <dig> and  <dig> days respectively, while hk <dig> , pdk <dig> , sorbs <dig> , pgc1α , and lipin1α  were not significantly altered.

the expression of two peripheral tissue regulators of circadian rhythm, albumin d-box binding protein , and nuclear factor interleukin  <dig> regulated  were significantly dysregulated by both acute and chronic formoterol administration .

in summary, formoterol administration mediated the significant modulates of several metabolic genes  associated with the transient induction of oxidative metabolism, particularly following acute stimulation of β-ar's. interestingly, the expression of these genes was normalized  <dig> h post treatment, and remained at control levels throughout the  <dig> days of formoterol administration. in addition, acute and chronic β2-ar agonist treatment significantly regulates the expression of two critical regulators of circadian cycling.

altered transcriptional regulation following formoterol administration
we have previously demonstrated that β-ar agonists markedly increased the expression of the nr4a subgroup  of nuclear receptor transcription factors in skeletal muscle  <cit> . from the illumina beadarray, ten transcription factors  were induced by formoterol  <dig> and  <dig> h post-administration . at one or more timepoints, acute administration of formoterol significantly induced nuclear receptor related  <dig> protein , camp responsive element modulator , and ccaat/enhancer binding protein β . in contrast, crem was the only transcription factor to remain elevated throughout the  <dig> day formoterol administration period .

discussion
a variety of studies have demonstrated that acute  β-ar stimulation in skeletal muscle induces hypertrophy, and modulates oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial parameters, energy expenditure, lipolysis  <cit> , glucose transport  <cit> , and glucose oxidation  <cit> .

to examine gene expression associated with these effects, we utilized illumina beadarray gene expression profiling to examine global gene expression in skeletal muscle in response to acute systemic administration  of a specific β2-ar agonist . in this study we have revealed that β2-ar agonist treatment altered the expression of several genes associated with myostatin signaling, a previously unreported effect of β-ar signaling in skeletal muscle. this is also the first study to demonstrate a β2-ar agonist regulation of circadian rhythm genes, indicating crosstalk between β-ar signaling and circadian cycling in skeletal muscle

skeletal muscle hypertrophy and myoblast differentiation
previous studies have demonstrated that systemic administration of β2-ar agonists induces hypertrophy in both skeletal and cardiac muscle  <cit> . furthermore, β2-ar agonists have been found to prevent or reverse the muscle wasting and weakness associated with numerous conditions . however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these changes have yet to be fully elucidated. the scientific literature is not consistent on whether β-ar agonists increase myofibrilar protein mass during hypertrophy by increased protein biosynthesis, decreased proteolysis, or both.

reeds et al.  <cit>  suggested that β-ar agonists do not increase global protein biosynthesis, however recent reports suggested that β-ar agonists increase the expression of several contractile proteins  <cit> , myogenin  <cit> , and initiators of protein translation  <cit> . in addition to effects on protein synthesis a number of studies have attributed increased myofibrilar protein content to an inhibition of myofibrilar proteolysis  <cit> , possibly via inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation  <cit> , ca2+-dependent proteolysis  <cit>  or calpain-mediated proteolysis  <cit> .

at the molecular level, the gene ankyrin repeat and socs box protein asb <dig>  known to promote protein synthesis and myoblast differentiation, has been found to be induced by β-ar stimulation  <cit> . similarly, both igf <dig> and igf <dig> mrna expression has been observed to increase following chronic systemic administration of β-ar agonists, suggesting the involvement of these growth factors in hypertrophy  <cit> . interestingly, in the current study no significant acute changes were observed in asb <dig> or igf <dig> , however igf <dig> expression was down-regulated  after four hours, a result that is not consistent with these previous studies  <cit> .

we have also included a more detailed table , which compares the illumina beadarray information in this study to previously published hypotheses on β-ar agonist-induced hypertrophy.

in our study, illumina beadarray expression profiling analysis revealed several gene expression changes associated with the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and myoblast differentiation. from the array , we observed alterations in stat <dig>  and smad <dig>  acvr2b three genes directly associated with the regulation of muscle hypertrophy. both acvr2b  and smad <dig> are downstream mediators of myostatin, a well-characterized negative regulator of muscle mass. with qrt-pcr, we also observed a subtle, but significant attenuation of the mrnas encoding myostatin in response to chronic β2-ar agonist treatment, however this was not detected by the acute illumina analysis. this is concordant with the chronic effects of formoterol administration on skeletal muscle, and could provide a partial mechanistic basis for hypertrophy.

while muscle growth from β-ar agonists is associated with hypertrophy, enhancement of myogenesis could lead to proliferation, differentiation, and/or recruitment of satellite cells into muscle fibers to promote muscle growth. we observed significant changes in itgb1bp <dig>  smad <dig>  smad <dig>  foxo <dig>  and, idb <dig>  genes believed to play an important role in regulating myogenesis. we observed significant changes in smad <dig> expression, and while closely related to smad <dig>  smad <dig> has not been associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy, however it may have a role in the regulation of myogenesis  <cit> . a complex of smad <dig> and  <dig> has been shown to transactivate id <dig>  <cit> , another myogenic gene altered by formoterol administration. interestingly, we observed a significant repression of foxo <dig>  a negative regulator of myogenesis, following  <dig> days of formoterol administration  <cit> , thus suggesting β2-ar agonist enhance myogenesis in the context of chronic treatment. furthermore, myostatin may also be a transcriptionaly regulated by foxo <dig>  <cit> , possibly suggesting coordinate regulation of hypertrophy and myogenesis via multiple mechanisms including fox01/myostatin signaling. moreover, we have performed western  analysis on the tibialis anterior muscle from  <dig> day vehicle  and β2-ar agonist treatment  treated mice . this demonstrated that formoterol treatment suppressed expression of pro-myostatin, and the levels of phospho-smad <dig>  these observations are in concordance with the attenuation of the myostatin signaling pathway and therefore the hypertrophic phenotype  <cit> .

in summary, formoterol administration induced significant changes in genes associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy and myogenesis. a broad overview of these expression changes are provided in figure 2h, notably highlighting possible crosstalk between β-ar signaling and myostatin/smad <dig> signaling pathway.

metabolism
many previous studies have implicated β-ar signaling in the control of metabolism. mice lacking all three β-ar are unable to effectively regulate energy expenditure and thus develop obesity on a high-fat diet  <cit> . in terms of skeletal muscle, β-ar agonist administration has been found to modulate oxidative metabolism, energy expenditure, lipolysis  <cit> , glucose transport  <cit>  glucose oxidation  <cit>  and mitochondrial morphology  <cit> . in the current study we found that formoterol administration significantly induced the expression of  <dig> genes associated with metabolism and mitochondrial function greater than  <dig>  fold . these consisted of genes involved in lipid regulation and metabolism, including lipin1α, foxo <dig>  scavenger receptor class b member  <dig> , phosphomevalonate kinase , plasma membrane associated protein , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ , and ucp <dig>  the largest change observed was the induction of pgc-1α, a key transcriptional regulator of oxidative metabolism and regulator of skeletal muscle fiber type and therefore lipid metabolism. genes involved in glucose metabolism/storage and insulin signaling were up-regulated, pdk <dig>  protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit 3c , and hk <dig> 

several of these genes have been previously identified in our studies following in vitro and in vivo treatment of muscle with a β2-ar agonist. for example, the induction of the mrnas encoding pgc1α, lipin1α, pdk <dig> and foxo <dig> in skeletal muscle were identified in our study  <cit>  and that of miura et al.  <cit> .

interestingly, the expression levels of pgc1α, lipin <dig> and foxo <dig> have also been found to be increased following exercise  <cit> , suggesting β2-ar treatment may imitate some functions and/or effects of exercise.

circadian rhythm
skeletal muscle, like most other tissues, is known to have a peripheral circadian clock, characterized by the expression of peripheral clock genes. it is thought that the regulation of these peripheral circadian clocks is ultimately regulated and synchronized by a central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, however the exact mechanism of communication to skeletal muscle remains unclear.

as previous studies have implicated β-ar signaling as a mediator of circadian rhythm  <cit> , it is of interest that we observed the dysregulation of three peripheral clock genes by formoterol administration , including nuclear factor, interleukin  <dig> , d site albumin promoter binding protein , and cryptochrome  <dig> . the observation, that only a subset of peripheral clock genes were dysregulated by formoterol administration suggests regulation of these genes is occurring at an organ specific level and not via direct actions on the central circadian clock since interference to the central circadian clock should result in changes to the majority of peripheral clock genes. furthermore, as only a small fraction of known circadian-regulated genes in skeletal muscle are being altered in our study , this suggests that these results are valid and not occurring due to minor timing issues that occur during tissue collection.

adrenergic regulation of the related clock gene cryptochrome  <dig>  has been previously reported in the rat pineal glands  <cit> . in addition, cry <dig> has been shown to be regulated by resistance exercise, a stimulus known to increase sympathetic activity in skeletal muscle  <cit> . this further underscores the crosstalk between exercise, and β2-ar signaling in the context of peripheral circadian control.

the central role of circadian rhythm in skeletal muscle metabolism is highlighted by the circadian changes in glucose utilization in muscle, and the findings that disruption of skeletal muscle circadian rhythm occurs in diabetic rats  <cit> . furthermore, major changes to peripheral clock genes have been found to be increased by altering the activity of amp kinase, a key metabolic regulator of skeletal muscle  <cit> . interestingly, ampk modulators have been recently described as exercise mimics  <cit> .

interestingly, a limited number of genes highlighted in this study have been shown to be regulated in the circadian transcriptome of adult mouse skeletal muscle  <cit> . cry <dig>  dbp, ucp <dig>  pdk <dig>  ubc, pgc1α, and usp <dig> have been shown to be regulated in the circadian transcriptome, possibly suggesting that these metabolic transcripts and usp <dig> may be regulated by dysregulated clock genes rather than directly by β-ar signaling. however, some genes such as pgc1α have a well characterized induction pathway involving β-ar signaling independent of circadian regulation  <cit> .

in conclusion, this is the first paper to show regulation of the peripheral circadian regulators in skeletal muscle by β-ar signaling, possibly implicating β-ar  signaling as a pathway that coordinates communication between central and peripheral circadian clocks in skeletal muscle.

transcription and histones
spurlock et al.  <cit>  have previously used microarray technology to examine skeletal muscle gene expression following chronic β-ar administration. in this study the authors found an up-regulation of transcriptional and translational initiators responsible for increasing protein synthesis. in this context, we observed the induction of  <dig> genes  noted as transcription factors . the  <dig> induced transcriptional regulators were fbj osteosarcoma oncogene , kruppel-like factors  <dig> and  <dig> , camp responsive element modulator , caat/enhancer binding protein beta , nuclear receptor related  <dig> protein , fos-like antigen  <dig> , v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family protein f , activating transcription factor  <dig> , t-box  <dig> , transcript variant  <dig>  and lps-induced tn factor .

interestingly, concomitant with transcriptional induction, our illumina analysis revealed that β2-ar stimulation significantly inhibited the expression of two histone proteins , suggesting that β-ar stimulation promote the formation of euchromatin, thus enhancing transcription. this result, coupled with the induction of transcription factors, indicates β-ar signaling may play an important role in regulating skeletal muscle transcription.

oxidative stress
in our study, many of the largest inductions occurred in genes associated with the response to oxidative stress. metallothioneins  <dig> and  <dig> , sulfiredoxin  <dig> homolog , and uncoupling protein  <dig>  were all significantly induced at four hours after formoterol administration. during exercise, reactive oxygen species  are generated in skeletal muscle  <cit> , and some oxidative damage occurs  <cit> . excess ros may lead to cellular damage, which has been implicated in with the development of insulin resistance  <cit> , and apoptosis of myoblasts  <cit> . given that exercise induces β-ar signaling activity in skeletal muscle  <cit> , this activity may provide a mechanism for increased expression of antioxidant genes to restore oxidative homeostasis. this is supported by the work of mahoney et al  <cit> , who demonstrated that exercise induced a wide range of antioxidant genes, including several metallothioneins. furthermore, induction of both ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> has also been shown previously to be induced by β-ar signaling in exercising skeletal muscle  <cit> . since ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> have been implicated in the reduction of ros  <cit> , it is possible that the induction of ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> expression in skeletal muscle is one mechanism for reducing ros production during or after exercise.

CONCLUSIONS
this study utilized gene expression profiling to examine global gene expression in skeletal muscle following acute and long-term  β-ar agonist administration. in summary, systemic administration of formoterol had a profound effect on global gene expression in skeletal muscle. with respect to skeletal muscle hypertrophy, formoterol altered the expression of several genes associated with the attenuation of myostatin signaling, highlighting the role of β-ar signaling in the mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle mass

interestingly, many changes in gene expression with β-ar signaling are similar to findings from other studies examining exercise-related effects in skeletal muscle. for example, the changes in expression of pgc1α, foxo <dig>  ucp <dig>  the nr4a subgroup and severalmetallothioneins are identical in both systems  <cit> . this would suggest the induction of β-ar signaling during exercise is a major determinant of the subsequent changes in gene expression changes following exercise.

the findings also demonstrate for the first time crosstalk between β-ar signaling and the peripheral regulators of circadian rhythm in skeletal muscle, possibly implicating β-ar signaling in circadian effects on skeletal muscle. gene expression changes discovered in the present study may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying β-ar-mediated changes in skeletal muscle hypertrophy and metabolism.
