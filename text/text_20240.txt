BACKGROUND
genes of higher plants are expressed in a coordinated fashion during development of tissue and organ systems and in response to different environmental conditions. this regulation may be tightly linked for some sets of genes, for example, in a specific biochemical pathway. expression of regulatory genes may modulate the expression of key genes or entire sets of genes in individual pathways. the investigation of single gene expression patterns as determined by rna blotting or quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr have been used to understand how different temporal, developmental, and physiological processes affect gene expression. with recent advances in genomics, very large numbers of genes can now be simultaneously analyzed for their expression levels in a comparative fashion between two biological states using microarray or biochip technology. several techniques for the 'global' analysis of gene expression have been described  <cit> . these include  high density expression arrays of cdnas on conventional nylon filters with radioactive probing;  microarrays or 'chips' using fluorescent probes, and  serial analysis of gene expression .

methods for global expression analysis require either knowledge of the entire genome of an organism or accumulation of a large est  database for the organism. in soybean , more than  <dig>  5' est sequences have been generated and deposited in public databases . these 5'ests represent a collection of  <dig> cdna libraries from different tissue and organ systems at various stages of development and under diverse physiological conditions. collaborative, multidisciplinary research to enhance the development of plant genome resources and information that would be publicly available for gene expression, gene tagging, and mapping has been a priority in recent years in plants of agronomic importance, including soybean  <cit> . here, we report the development, qualification, and use of  <dig>  members of a low redundancy set of tentatively unique cdnas or 'unigenes' in soybean. the 3' sequence of this set was determined and microarrays constructed. the public availability of the low redundancy clone set, sequence information, and microarrays reported here will greatly enhance gene discovery and genomic scale research in soybean and other legumes by the community of researchers. for example, we illustrate the use of the 5' and 3' sequence-verified cdna microarrays to determine organ-specific expression and we demonstrate their potential to discover the molecular basis of specific mutations in closely related isogenic lines.

RESULTS
cluster analysis of  <dig>  ests reveals  <dig>  'unigenes' in soybean
the combined number of contigs and singletons  resulting from a computer assembly of ests is an estimate of the number of unique genes in the organism. as the number of ests grows, the number of unique genes in the organism will continue to be refined. our current contig analysis of the entire public est collection for soybean of  <dig>  sequences yields  <dig>  'unigenes' of which  <dig>  are contigs and  <dig>  are singletons.

the finding of  <dig>  soybean unigenes by est cluster analysis agrees well with an independent contig and unigene assembly in the databases of the institute for genomic research  which shows  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons for a total of  <dig>  tentatively unique sequences from among  <dig>  sequences representing all publicly available sequences clustered in release  <dig>  <cit> . other large scale plant est collections as analyzed by the tigr gene indices  <cit>  show  <dig>  unigenes for arabidopsis thaliana ,  <dig>  for medicago truncatula ,  <dig>  for tomato ,  <dig>  for wheat  and  <dig>  for maize . the complete genome sequence for arabidopsis has revealed an estimated  <dig>  genes  <cit> . of course, the unigene sets determined by est clustering are only estimates of the number of unique genes in an organism and depend on the number of ests available, the technologies used to make the libraries, and the bioinformatic methods used to assign clusters. the soybean genome is approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp which is about  <dig>  times the size of the arabidopsis genome and twice that of tomato, but less than half the size of the maize genome. thus, it is not unexpected that soybean may have a larger number of unigene clusters than arabidopsis or tomato, for example. although soybean is not hexaploid in origin as is modern wheat, it is thought to be an ancient autotetraploid and many examples of duplicate loci exist in soybean.

virtual subtraction using high density cdna filter arrays increases gene discovery in immature cotyledon libraries that abundantly express storage protein gene transcripts
certain tissues contain large amounts of specialized transcripts. developing soybean cotyledons, for example, contain large amounts of rna transcripts representing highly expressed storage protein genes. in order to select for some of the weakly expressed cdna clones from a mid-maturation stage cotyledon library, we used a virtual subtraction approach using high densisty filters. a total of  <dig>  bacterial clones containing cdnas from library gm-c <dig>  was printed in high density on nylon filters and probed with 33p-cdna produced by reverse transcription of total mrna isolated from immature soybean cotyledons. figure 2a shows the highly complex hybridization pattern resulting from using total mrna from immature cotyledons to probe the high density filter. the intensity of each dot represents the hybridization signal and the relative abundance of that cdna in the message population. the phosphorimager pattern was quantified by image analysis software and  <dig> of the lowest expressing clones were selected. the cdna clones were physically reracked to a new set of  <dig> well plates to form the filter-normalized reracked library designated gm-r <dig>  the 5' end of these clones were then sequenced at washington university. figure 2b shows that  <dig> , or 85%, of the  <dig> sequences within the filter-driven reracked library gm-r <dig> were novel and not found in any of the  <dig> sequenced clones from the gm-c <dig> source cdna library. thus, the filter normalization method was an effective way to identify cdnas with low expression and increase gene discovery in libraries that contain large numbers of transcripts from highly expressed genes. the virtual subtraction method using high density cdna filters compares favorably with other mrna subtraction methods used to create normalized libraries during the cloning process  <cit> .

selection and 3' sequencing of  <dig>  soybean cdnas from the soybean unigene set to use in microarrays
high density cdna arrays of bacterial cultures spotted on nylon membranes and probed with radioactively labeled transcripts are useful for gene discovery as illustrated in figure  <dig> above, but they have limited use for quantifying the relative abundance of transcripts expressed in independent mrna samples. an alternative method to the high density filters is microarray technology  <cit>  in which pcr-amplified cdna inserts, or oligonucleotides, are printed on glass slides and probed with mrnas populations that have been separately labeled with different fluorescent probes.

to enable global expression studies, the ideal would be to have each gene represented at least once on an array. toward this aim, we selected  <dig>  of the cdna clones by four successive clustering assemblies of the soybean cdnas performed as the 5' est data accumulated. table  <dig> shows the four reracked sets of cdna clones  and the level of uniqueness within them as defined by phrap and cap <dig> analysis  <cit> . thus, the clustering was conducted periodically as the number of 5' est input sequences grew in size. after each clustering, the previously selected and reracked cdnas were excluded from subsequent reracking lists. in order to develop a 'unigene' set for soybean, a single representative of each contig was chosen. to select a representative from each contig, we chose the cdna clone corresponding to the est that was found at the furthest 5' region of each contig. thus, we are selecting the cdna clones most likely to be near full-length.

a unless otherwise noted, the ests included in the cluster analysis represent only the cdnas for which both the 5' and 3' sequences are known and for which the read length is over  <dig> bases.

b the number of singletons  and number of contigs  are shown.

c the % unique sequences is the number of singletons plus the number of contigs divided by the total number of ests.

d in this analysis, all 5' sequences were included even if the corresponding 3' sequence was not known.

est clustering will overestimate the number of unique genes as some of the shorter ests will not overlap and thus are falsely counted as independent, unique sequences. however, the clustering analysis can also falsely lump non-identical members of gene families into the same contig based on conservation of sequence similarity in the coding region. the 3' sequencing is especially useful for resolving both of these issues as there is generally more variation in the 3' utr in plant genes than in the coding region. for those reasons and as a quality control of the reracking process, we sequenced the 3' end of the reracked cdnas. from the  <dig>  total 3' sequencing attempts on the tentatively unique cdnas represented in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  sequences met the criteria of high quality sequence. the 3' sequencing was more problematic than the 5' sequencing due to termination of the sequencing reactions at some of the long polya tails characteristic of soybean and many other plant cdnas. an anchored primer was used to increase the success rate . the average length of the 3' ests was  <dig> bases compared to the average 5' sequence read length of  <dig> for  <dig>  ests.

since the clustering analyses were performed at successive intervals as the est collection grew in size, we repeated the phrap contig analyses separately using only the input sequences of each cdna rerack for which both a 5' and 3' est were known. we also performed a cap <dig> analysis  <cit> . table  <dig> shows that cap <dig> values for the 5' sequence yielded  <dig>  to  <dig> % unique sequences while the phrap values were slightly lower at  <dig>  to  <dig> % unique sequences. interestingly, the estimate of unique sequences using the 5' est data did not change substantially from reracked library r <dig> where only approximately  <dig> ests were clustered through library r <dig> where over  <dig>  sequences were clustered. a separate cluster analysis of only the  <dig>  input 5' sequences revealed  <dig>  to  <dig> % unique sequences by phrap and cap <dig> analyses, respectively.

the 3' ests were also separately subjected to cap <dig> or phrap analysis. the cap <dig> values showed a slightly higher level of uniqueness  with  <dig>  to  <dig> % for cap <dig> in the successive clustering analyses versus  <dig>  to  <dig> % unique sequences as determined by phrap. an overall figure of  <dig> % for the cap <dig> analysis on the  <dig>  total 3' sequences clustered was found versus  <dig> % for phrap.

the differences between the 5' and 3' levels of uniqueness  can be explained by the nature of reverse transcriptase action. the reverse transcriptase was primed using an oligo dt primer and so the cdnas will begin at the 3' end and will terminate randomly at variable sites as the enzyme progresses to the 5' end of the mrna template. thus, 5' ests often begin at variable sites. therefore, even though two 5' ests may have originated from the same mrna transcript, they will not cluster if they are non-overlapping and will be counted as two separate ests. the 3' soybean est reads begin just after the poly a tail and produce longer average read lengths than the 5' soybean ests; thus, the 3' ests are more likely to form an overlapping contig if there is any redundancy among them.

the 5' and 3' sequence  of each soybean unigene were queried against the non-redundant  database with blastx  <cit> . annotations were assigned to each 5'and 3' if the best match had an e value of ≤10- <dig>  table  <dig> shows a complete cross list of all identifiers for each member of the  <dig>  soybean unigenes in the reracked libraries including the 5' and 3' annotations.

construction of microarrays representing the  <dig>  soybean unigene cdnas
the current 'unigene' collection  represents low redundancy sets of cdna clones. we have processed all of these cdnas for microarrays, as outlined in the methods section, into three sets of  <dig>  cdnas per array. as shown in table  <dig>  these include reracked libraries gm-r <dig> ; gm-r <dig> plus gm-r <dig> ; and gm-r <dig> . as an example, the gm-r <dig> set contains  <dig>  tentatively unique cdnas that are directly derived from two flower cdna libraries  that were sequenced deeply with over  <dig>  5' ests obtained from these two libraries. in addition, a total of  <dig>  cdnas on the array are directly derived from source libraries made from the immature stages of cotyledon development and representing over  <dig>  input sequences from the cotyledon stages of seed development.

a more description of the reracked and source libraries are available in genbank at 

b tissues were collected from plants grown in greehouse or growth chamber except for the immature and mature flowers which were collected from plants grown in the field.

c since the gm-r <dig> reracked liabrary contains  <dig> cdnas, a total of  <dig> were repeated to obtain an even  <dig> when combined with the gm-r <dig> cdnas.

the cdnas from the sequence-driven, reracked clone sets were amplified by pcr using the qiagen-purified cdna templates that were prepared for 3' sequencing . all  <dig>  pcr reactions were performed with generic m <dig> forward and reverse primers using a robotic pipettor. approximately 25% of the purified pcr cdna inserts were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis for quality control. of these, the average insert size was estimated to be  <dig>  bp for library gm-r <dig>   <dig>  bp for library gm-r <dig>   <dig>  for library gm-r <dig>  and  <dig>  bp for library gm-r <dig> 

the  <dig>  amplified inserts of each set were singly spotted onto glass slides as outlined in the methods section. a set of  <dig> control or 'choice' clones was assembled by hand into one 96-well plate  and printed eight times repetitively throughout each array. thus, the total number of spots on the array is  <dig>  consisting of  <dig>  cdnas from the unigene set plus  <dig>  from the choice clones. the choice clones were selected for various reasons. some represent constitutively expressed genes . some are cdnas whose expression is restricted to a subset of specific plant tissues . some are clones of enzymes representing commonly used antibiotic resistance markers in transgenic plants , and  <dig> are cdnas that represent at least  <dig> different enzymes of the flavonoid pathway. the flavonoid pathway was chosen because the corresponding genes often respond to many biotic and abiotic stress conditions and it has been widely studied in plant systems.

soybean microarrays have potential to reveal the molecular basis of a mutant phenotype
 intensities after background subtraction and global normalization between replicates and within each slide are shown.

 the mean ratios of the  <dig> flavonoid hydroxylase cdnas are significant below the p =  <dig>  level in a t-test compared to  <dig>  as the mean.

 the average ratio of both slides is calculated by as follows:  / 

 the matches for all of the functional annotations were to soybean  sequences except for the ribonucleoprotein homolog which was to arabidopsis thaliana.

an examination of the ratios of the  <dig> repetitively spotted flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cdnas using a t test showed that the mean ratio of the repeated cdnas on replicate  <dig>  were statistically significant at a p value of  <dig>  when compared to an expected mean of a  <dig> , or a two-fold expression difference. the low p values were also found for replicate  <dig> and for the mean value  of both replicates. thus, the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cdnas are statistically significant outliers in the microarray analysis.

the microarray data presented here and showing that the cytoplasmic levels of the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase are higher in the t/t line agree very well with rna blot data which showed that the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase gene has reduced expression in the seed coats of the t*/t* isoline compared to the t/t lines  <cit> . in addition to the rna blot data showing differences in these mutant lines, we have definitively shown that the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase is encoded by the t locus by sequence data of other alleles of the locus and by genetic cosegregation data  <cit> . we do not know the reason for the change in the expression levels of the seven other cdnas as shown in table  <dig>  most of them representing various seed or storage type proteins. while the t locus does determine the flavonoid and pigment compounds synthesized in various tissues including seed coats and trichomes, it is possible that the flavonoid compounds themselves modulate an additional effect on seed protein synthesis in the seed coats. alternatively, the observed differences in the levels of these cdnas could be due to an artifact during the dissection procedure. we know from northern blots, that flavonoid 3' hydroxylase is highly expressed in the seed coats, but is not expressed in the cotyledons so any small amount of contaminating cotyledon cells due to imprecise dissection of the seed coats of one line versus the other could lead to observed differences in seed protein rnas.

as this example in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> illustrates, the use of dual labeled mrnas from near isogenic lines to probe microarrays is a powerful approach with which to obtain a small list of candidate genes from among the thousands examined by microarray analysis. in this example only eight functionally different cdnas  of over  <dig> cdnas spotted on the array met the criteria of exceeding two-fold levels of expression in both replicates. if a cdna is repetitively spotted on an array, as were the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cdnas, then the data are statistically significant. after identifying a short list of candidate genes, it is then feasible to test them by other methods  in order to find an association of a particular cdna with the mutant phenotype. of course, if a particular mutation has a regulatory or epigenetic effect on a large number of downstream rnas, or if a mutation does not affect the abundance of an mrna, then the global expression approach may not be effective in identifying the primary nature of the mutant locus. for example, the standard recessive t allele at the t locus is the result of a premature stop codon and does not affect abundance of the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase mrna to the same extent as does the t* mutation at that locus  <cit> .

tissue specific gene expression using the soybean microarrays
in contrast to the results with near isogenic lines of the t locus which showed that relatively few cdnas showed differential expression between the two very closely related lines, the soybean microarrays reveal larger numbers of cdnas showing differential mrna abundance levels in different tissue types of the same plants. for illustration, figure  <dig> shows one of the two replicates of a dual labeling experiment using the low redundancy set gm-r <dig> of  <dig>  cdnas. the cy <dig> labeled probe in this experiment was rna from roots of hydroponically grown soybean plants, and the cy <dig> probe was rna from leaves of the same plants. the upper ratio threshold is  <dig>  and the lower threshold is  <dig> .

the soybean proline-rich protein   is also among the root expressed clones. sbprp <dig> has been shown to be expressed preferentially in the roots  <cit> . a gene of interest overexpressed in roots is the dad- <dig> . no rubisco or photosynthesis related genes were observed to be over expressed in the roots as would be expected for the non-green tissues.

in leaves, genes typical for green tissues are upregulated as expected. these are the photosynthesis genes , and the vegetative storage proteins. ribosomal proteins, cytochrome p <dig>  catalase, and chitinase were also noted as overexpressed in the leaves.

our publicly available gm-r <dig> soybean unigene subset containing  <dig>  cdnas has also been used to examine differential gene expression in roots and shoots of older soybean plants  <cit> . we have previously utilized microarrays containing  <dig>  clones of the gm-r <dig> set  to carry out a detailed analysis of induction of somatic embryos during culture of cotyledons on auxin-containing media  <cit> . the resulting transcript profiles were subjected to a cluster analysis and revealed the process of reprogramming of the cotyledons cells during the induction process. the  <dig> cdnas  that were differentially expressed were clustered into  <dig> sets using a non-hierarchical method  to reveal cdnas with similar profiles in either the adaxial or the abaxial side of the embryos from  <dig> to  <dig> days in  <dig> day intervals. among other conclusions, these global expression studies indicated that auxin induces dedifferentiation of the cotyledon and provokes a surge of cdnas involved in cell division and oxidative burst.

thus, the soybean cdna arrays that we have developed from the unigene cdna set can be used to reveal the underlying physiological and biochemical pathways potentially operative in specific tissues, developmental stages, or environmental treatments. obviously, cdna arrays from soybean or any other organism that are constructed with pcr inserts representing an average size of  <dig>  kb will generally hybridize with any rnas from gene family members that share greater than 85% homology. thus, cdna arrays will generally not distinguish expression from closely related duplicated sequences. oligo arrays spotted with synthetic 70-mers or affymetrix short oligo arrays have greater potential to separate the expression from close related duplicated sequences if the oligos are chosen from the 3' or 5' non-coding regions that carry more sequence variability than the protein coding regions.

CONCLUSIONS
although microarray data is limited from soybean and most plants other than arabidopsis, the construction of the  <dig>  member low redundancy 'unigene' cdnas for soybean reported in this paper will greatly stimulate this area. the number of slides containing all  <dig>  of the cdnas is being reduced to one, or at most two slides, and the slides are publicly available. spotted pcr products with average size of over  <dig> kb are useful not only for soybean, but for other legume species as cross hybridization to the long probes will be substantial. the 3' sequencing reported here is particularly useful for differentiating gene family members and for future design of gene specific oligo arrays of either 70-mers spotted on glass slides or by affymetrix technology using short oligos synthesized in situ. the cdna or oligo-based microarrays add to the developing suite of genome analysis approaches in soybean  <cit> . a few of the unlimited applications include profiling expression from genes that respond to challenges by various pathogens and by environmental stresses as drought, heat, cold, flooding, and herbicide application. also, by analysis of the near isogenic lines of the t locus as an example, we demonstrated the potential of soybean cdna arrays to be used for discovery of genes responsible for uncharacterized mutations. future expression profiling of mutant phenotypes or of genotypes that differ in protein or oil content and other quantitative traits will yield significant clues to the genes involved in those pathways and traits.
