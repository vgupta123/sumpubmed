BACKGROUND
animal cloning is a break-through technology with emerging potential applications in agricultural and biomedical research. however, the technology is hindered by very low rates of healthy live births attributed to high incidences of placental abnormalities leading to embryonic losses  <cit> . the major sources of these abnormalities is thought to be genetic and epigenetic modifications occurred due to improper reprogramming of donor cells after nuclear transfer leading to post-implantation lethality or abnormality  <cit> . key mechanisms underlying this aberration are dna methylation, histone remodeling and telomere maintenance, which are involved in the control of gene expression, x chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting  <cit> . however, all these mechanisms are not contributing equally to the embryonic and extra-embryonic lineage  <cit> . specially, genomic imprinting was found to be less or not dependent on dna methylation for its somatic maintenance in placentas than in the embryos. whereas, placenta-specific imprinting has been shown to be more dependent on repressive histone modifications as well as regulation by non-coding rnas  <cit> . among the non-coding rnas, a recently discovered class of small rnas, namely mirnas appeared as important regulators of gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. they are found to play important roles including but not restricted to cell proliferation, apoptosis, diseases and differentiation during mammalian development  <cit> . moreover, they are targeted by epigenetic modifications in which some imprinted mirnas were found to undergo subsequent epigenetic reprogramming in mouse embryos  <cit> . however, the patterns of mirnas expression contributing to the widely addressed placental abnormalities along with genetic and epigenetic modifications in the ivp or nt placentas are yet to be discovered. therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the expression of regulatory non-coding mirnas in bovine day- <dig> placentas derived from pregnancies established after ai or transfer of ivp and scnt derived bovine embryos. for this, the expression of  <dig> mirnas was investigated using a quantitative real time pcr array technology in placentas of these three origins as well as donor fibroblast cells used for scnt. furthermore, selected differentially expressed mirnas were analyzed for their expression in expanded blastocysts, day- <dig> elongated embryos as well as placentas at day  <dig> and day  <dig> of pregnancies from scnt, ivp and ai embryos. finally, methylation status and activities of mirnas processing molecules were also studied in those samples.

RESULTS
differential mirna expression in day- <dig> placentas of different sources of pregnancy
the expressions of  <dig> mirnas were compared between placentas at day  <dig> of pregnancy derived from nt , ivp  and ai  embryos . among the  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> mirnas were found to be downregulated in nt placentas with  <dig> or more fold change with p-value ≤  <dig> , while only  <dig> mirnas  were found to be upregulated in the same placenta group compared to the placentas of ai pregnancies. out of all downregulated mirnas,  <dig> were unique to the nt placentas compared either to ai or ivp placentas. on the other hand, a total of  <dig> mirnas were found to be differentially expressed in the nt placentas compared to their ivp counterparts. among these, only  <dig> mirnas were upregulated and the remaining  <dig> mirnas were found to be downregulated. comparison of ivp and ai derived placentas revealed differential expression of  <dig> mirnas, of which  <dig> mirnas  and  <dig> mirna were found to be up and down regulated, respectively. of these downregulated  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> were also found to be down regulated in nt placentas compared to ivp derived ones.

comparative expression of mirna between donor cells and nt day- <dig> placentas
to investigate the source-of-origin specific mirna expression pattern, the profiles of same  <dig> mirnas have been compared between nt placentas and the fibroblast donor cells. a total of  <dig> mirnas were found to be differentially expressed between these two groups by fold change  <dig> or more with p value ≤ <dig> . among these,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were found to be up and down regulated in nt placentas compared to fibroblast donor cells, respectively.

chromosomal allocation of deregulated mirnas in nt and ivp placentas
the chromosomal location of deregulated mirnas and features of genomic regions were retrieved from mirbase v  <dig> and ensembl genome browser   <cit> . deregulated mirnas in nt and ivp placentas were found to exhibit similar patterns and localizations on the chromosomes as polycistronic clusters. one of such genomic region has been identified in bovine chromosome  <dig>  harboring at least  <dig> clusters of mirnas comprising more than  <dig> mirnas . most of these clustered mirnas were found to be downregulated in nt and some in ivp placentas compared to that of ai. genomic sequence of these cluster were found to be devoid of any protein coding gene but enriched in several genomic variable elements including different types of transposone elements, , tandem repeats , long terminal repeats  and numerous snps . however, most of these elements and snps were found to be residing out side the mature mirna or precursor sequences. moreover, family wise expression pattern of mirnas was evident for differentially expressed mirnas . the top  <dig> mirnas, which are downregulated in nt and ivp day- <dig> placentas, belong to  <dig> distinct mirna families. similarly, mirnas sharing similar sequence  were also found to be deregulated in the placentas in a similar manner. interestingly, most of the mirnas located on the bovine x-chromosome, were found not to be differentially regulated between contrasting types of placentas under investigation . however, among the x-linked mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were found to be downregulated in nt and ivp placentas compared to their ai counterparts.

localization of selected mirnas in expanded blastocyst of nt, ivp and ai origin
to identify spatial difference in mirnas expression at earliest stage of development and existence of aberrant expression of mirna between trophectoderms derived from different sources of blastocysts, candidate mirnas were localized through whole mount in-situ hybridization. among these candidate mirnas, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were found to be intensively localized to the trophectoderm, while mir-302b to inner cell mass considering in-vivo  derived expanded blastocyst . expression of trophectoderm specific mirnas was lower in nt blastocysts compared to ai counterparts. two other mirnas , which are residing in the large imprinted chromosomal region were found to be similarly expressed in both the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm of ai blastocysts, while being aberrantly expressed in nt blastocysts. in nt blastocysts, mir- <dig> is almost depleted from the trophectoderm with no change in the inner cell mass. results of in situ hybridization of mirnas revealed aberrant mirnas expression in the trophectoderm and inner cell mass of nt expanded blastocyst compared to their ai counterparts. negative control probes have been used for all groups during hybridization and they were found to be negative .

temporal expression pattern of candidate mirnas in different sources of placenta
expression profiling of candidate mirnas considering in vivo, in vitro or nt originated day- <dig> blastocyst, expanded blastocyst, day- <dig> elongated embryos, day- <dig> placentas and day- <dig> placentomes revealed that the major deregulations were likely to happen in the nt placentas at day- <dig> of the pregnancy when compared to the ai placentas . however, the extent of this deregulation in ivp placentas at day  <dig> was lower and showed very less difference compared to the placentas of ai at day  <dig> of pregnancy. moreover, this deregulation of mirnas found to be started as early as first cell lineage differentiation in nuclear transfer derived embryos and progressing to the later stage. this is more profound in the day- <dig> placentas, at which time point, most aberrant mirnas expression is evident concomitant to redifferentiation for placentogenesis.

dna methylation status in different sources of elongated embryos and placentas
global dna methylation pattern has been investigated in elongated day- <dig> embryos and day- <dig> placentas derived from nt, ivp and ai pregnancies. results revealed a global hypomethylation of dna in all three groups  across these two stages of development  . in contrast, there was no significant difference in global dna methylation pattern comparing elongated day- <dig> embryos as well as day- <dig> placentas between nt, ivp and ai pregnancies.

expression pattern of mirnas processing genes in ivp and nt placentas
expression profiling of mirna processing machinery genes in day- <dig> placentas from nt and ivp pregnancies compared to that of ai was performed . results revealed that all genes under study except ago <dig> were transcriptionally reprogrammed in nt compared to ai placentas. however, mirna processing genes including ago <dig>  ago <dig>  gemin <dig>  and xpo <dig> were found to be deregulated in ivp placentas compared to their ai counterparts. ago <dig>  mrna and protein  were found to be down regulated in both nt and ivp day- <dig> placentas compared to that of ai.

status of ago <dig> promoter methylation in different placentas
the dna methylation status of  <dig> cpg sites in the cpg island of ago <dig> promoter region were analyzed and results evidenced a significantly higher methylation status of the ago <dig> promoter in nt placentas  compared to ai placentas  . in ivp placentas, the promoter was methylated by 76 ±  <dig> %. moreover, two cpg sites located at 757 bp and 789 bp downstream of the transcription start site, respectively  showed significantly increased dna methylation  in nt placentas compared to ai placentas .

functional analysis of ago <dig> in differentiation of trophoblastic stem cells 
to substantiate, whether global deregulation of mirnas is associated with defective differentiation of trophoblast cells leading to abnormal placentogenesis in the in-vitro model, tbss were derived and used to induce knockdown of ago <dig> mrna using sequence specific sirna. the tbss were derived from in vitro produced bovine blastocysts which were found to form a monolayer sheet of polygonal cells on type i collagen coated flasks . spherical multicellular vesicles of  <dig> to 900 μm in diameter were found to be continuously formed through accumulation of fluid under the cell sheet . these vesicles, which resemble the trophectoderm of blastocysts, were used for subculture and subsequent knock-down experiments. the epithelial phenotype of tbss was validated by the expression of ifn-tau, which is a marker of trophectoderm cells in ruminants  . the procedure of tbss culture for in vitro differentiation in this experiment was modified from nakano et al.,  and results revealed not only the differentiation of tbss into binucleate cells  but also into distinct types of different mononucleated cells namely trophoblast giant cells , spongiotrophoblast cells , glycogen cells , and syncytial trophoblast cells  . differentiated tbss were characterized by lower to almost no expression of cdx <dig> and higher expression of pag <dig> by rt-pcr .

effect of ago <dig> knock down on in vitro differentiation of tbss
induced down regulation of mirnas during in vitro tbs cell differentiation was achieved through knock down of ago <dig> by sirna technology. specificity of sirna mediated ago <dig> knock-down was confirmed by significant reduction of the corresponding mrna by approximately 60%  and resulted in reduced protein expression for the same gene as demonstrated by western blotting  as well as immunocytochemistry  compared to the controls. quantitative real time pcr was used to analyze changes with respect to expression of some candidate trophectoderm/placenta specific and imprinted mirnas, which were found to be downregulated after ago <dig> knockdown . expression of tbss cell differentiation and placental cell markers  suggested that ago2-deficient cells exhibited differentiation but showed several marked cellular and morphological deviation compared to control cells . ago2-deficient cells were characterized by reduction  of primary trophoblastic giant cells as well as a significant reduction of their differentiation into secondary cells  compared to control cells . overall endopolyploidy level, which is determined by the average number of dapi stained blue nucleus per cells was found to be significantly reduced  in ago <dig> knocked down cells. inline with that, a reduced average size of nuclei was observed in the transfected cell. a trophoblast cell was considered apoptotic when showing fragmented nuclei  which were significantly higher  in ago2-sirna transfected cells compared to non-transfected groups . likewise, a remarkable reduction in cumulative alkaline phosphatase activity  in the ago2-sirnas transfected cells was observed .

discussion
differential regulation of mirnas in day- <dig> nt and ivp placentas
the aberrant genetic or epigenetic modifications in the nt placentas due to errors in nuclear reprogramming have been evidenced by aberrant non-coding rna expression, imprinting problems, changes in dna methylation and histone/chromatin modifications  <cit> . among the non-coding rnas, mirnas were found to be aberrantly reprogrammed in cloned mouse blastocyst  <cit>  and bovine day- <dig> elongated embryos  <cit> . in the present study a large number of mirnas were found to be transcriptionally not reprogrammed correctly in the nt  and ivp  derived placentas. relative expression analysis revealed a massive down regulation of mirnas in day- <dig> nt and ivp placentas compared to the day- <dig> placentas from ai pregnancies. this difference could be due to the cumulative effects of somatic cell nuclear transfer and in vitro culture of the resulting embryos. at least 62% of the mirna studied in day- <dig> nt placentas were differentially expressed compared to ivp placentas, where 90% of them were found to be downregulated. overall 36% of the  <dig> mirnas studied were differentially regulated between ivp and ai placentas, of which about 96% were downregulated in ivp placentas. these massive deregulations could be entailed to the reported radically altered gene expression in cloned placenta  <cit>  associated to poor placentome development in nt pregnancies in the first trimester leading to subsequent pregnancy loss.

reprogramming errors in nt or ivp derived embryos have been postulated to happen as a multi-step process and the effect could vary depending on the stage of development  <cit> . it has been suggested that the commonly observed low developmental efficiency of nt embryos may not be largely due to nuclear reprogramming during early embryo development but potentially caused by abnormal gene reprogramming during postimplantation feto-placental development  <cit> . while, nt blastocyst more closely resemble the in vivo derived ones compared to in vitro fertilized embryos in terms of global gene expression  <cit> , trophoblast lineage was found to be significantly affected by reprogramming errors arising from epigenetic modifications during post blastocyst stage  <cit> . the results of the present study showed that the major deregulation of mirnas in nt placentas to be most profound at day  <dig> of pregnancy. moreover, differences in their expression are also evident and advancing to expanded blastocyst and embryo elongation stage. in addition, trophectoderm specific mirnas were found to be aberrantly expressed in the nt and ivp expanded blastocysts compared to that of ai, while inner cell mass specific mirnas were less or not aberrantly expressed in either nt or ivp expanded blastocysts compared to their ai counterparts.

those mirnas, which are located within or nearby imprinted regions of the chromosome, showed a clear deregulation of their expression in nt and ivp expanded blastocyst when compared to expanded ai blastocysts. collectively, the results of the present study evidenced trophoblast specific and imprinted mirnas to be aberrantly expressed in nt blastocysts when compared to mirnas which are specific for the inner cell mass or embryonic stem cells. similarly, previous studies have reported changes in mirna expression during trophectoderm specification  <cit>  and aberrant epigenetic reprogramming and thus expression of imprinted mirnas  in cloned mouse embryos  <cit> . therefore, a profound deregulation of mirna expression due to reprogramming failure is found to occur around day  <dig> of nt pregnancies at which time complex placentomes are developing. the deregulation of mirnas at the elongated stage could be attributed to the cell specific aberrant expression, but this could not be elucidated as because, elongated embryos were comprised of embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. however, at day  <dig> of pregnancy differences with respect to mirna expression were significantly evident by down regulation of most of them in nt placentas compared to ai counterparts. interestingly, the degree of mirna deregulation at day  <dig> of pregnancy either in nt or ivp compared to ai was found to be very small, indicating temporal regulation of these mirnas in bovine placentas. at approximately day  <dig>  those fetuses with suboptimal placentome formation and with more deregulated mirna expression could be slowly starved to death, whereas fetus that progress beyond this stage have better placentome development as studied previously  <cit> .

major causes for mirna deregulation in nt and ivp derived placentas
major sources of aberrant gene expression in nt placentas have been found to be due to abnormal epigenetic and genetic processes. these include non-coding rna mediated regulation, aberrant dna methylation, genomic imprinting and chromatin remodeling. maintenance of imprinting has been shown to be less dependent on dna methylation in the placenta compared to the embryo itself, with involvement of repressive histone methylation rather than dna methylation  <cit> . the present findings reveal that there is no significant difference in global dna methylation in elongated day- <dig> embryos and day- <dig> placentas derived from nt, ivp and ai. therefore, it is possible to postulate that other genetic or epigenetic processes including aberrant regional chromatin remodeling rather than global dna methylation are responsible for massive deregulation of mirnas in the nt or ivp placentas.

bioinformatic analysis of the deregulated mirnas revealed that mirnas were mostly deregulated as cluster and show similarities in their deregulation between the members within the same mirna family. they were found to be transcribed in a large transcription units of coding or non-coding genes using their own promoters as an independent entities or as polycistrons  <cit> . therefore, any transcriptional or processing disturbance during the earlier stage of cloned embryo and extra embryonic lineage differentiation due to improper reprogramming of specific regulatory molecules responsible for global transcription, processing and maturation of mirnas could be a potential reason for global down regulation of mirnas in nt or ivp derived placentas. to elucidate these possibilities, we profiled  <dig> well known mirna processing machinery genes in different placentas of different origins. our results indicate that several of such molecules were not proper reprogrammed in nt or ivp derived placentas when compared to that of ai derived placentas or donor fibroblast cells. among them, eukaryotic transcription initiation factor 2c <dig>  or ago <dig> was found to be down regulated in the nt and ivp placentas due to hypermethylation of their promoter region compared to that placentas derived from ai, which could be linked to down regulation of mirnas as reported previously  <cit> . expression of ago <dig> has been shown to be stable in trophoblast  <cit>  and important in many biological processes and development including mouse oogenesis  <cit> , early development  <cit>  and maternal-zygotic transition  <cit> . embryonic fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells from ago <dig> knockout mouse showed reduction of all mature mirnas  <cit> . therefore, according to previous reports and findings of this study, it is possible to speculate that global down regulation of mirnas in the nt and ivp derived day- <dig> placentas compared to that of ai might be due to deregulation of mirna processing genes along with aberrant reprogramming of other factors.

according to the results published so far on the role of mirnas in early mammalian development, it is clear that earliest differentiation events leading to epiblast and trophectoderm lineages proceed normally in the absence of canonical mirnas  <cit> . the present study however shows that the second lineage differentiation is affected by deregulation of mirnas. it has been reported that ago2-mutant embryos show abnormalities in implanted decidua and hypotrophic placentas including marked reduction in the thickness of the labyrinthine layer  <cit> . the present study, however, adds many additional cellular and morphological defects in the trophoblast differentiation in vitro including reduced trophoblastic giant cells, endopolyploidy, increased apoptosis and reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study revealed a massive deregulation of mirnas in bovine day- <dig> placentas derived from transfer of cloned or in vitro produced bovine embryos. most of the mirnas were found to be poorly reprogrammed and to be affected as large chromosomal cluster and mirna families. these findings suggest that genome wide aberrant expression of mirnas due to reprogramming failure of mirna processing regulatory molecules , regional chromatin remodeling affecting polycystronic mirna expression and imprinting problems in placentas of nuclear transfer derived pregnancy, may result in abnormal regulation of transcriptional activities leading to subsequent pregnancy loss. taken together, aberrant expression of transcriptional regulatory mirna molecules during redifferentiation for placentogenesis leading to abnormal genetic and epigenetic modification in the placentas from cloned conceptuses are likely caused by re-programming failure as a consequence of somatic cell nuclear transfer as well as environmental conditions during in vitro culture. being important gene regulators, mirnas could display an interesting avenue to resolve numerous open questions in terms of regulatory mechanisms involved in genetic and/or epigenetic aberrations in placentas of scnt or ivp pregnancies.
