BACKGROUND
in april of  <dig>  a new pandemic h1n <dig>  influenza virus strain emerged in mexico  <cit> , and the subsequent global pandemic claimed more than  <dig>  lives  <cit> . human infections with ph1n <dig> tended to be mild with typical clinical symptoms   <cit> . however, in instances where death occurred, autopsies showed necrotizing bronchitis, a symptom that has also been observed in previous pandemics  <cit> . loss of life during the  <dig> pandemic was minor compared to other pandemics ; however,  <dig> ph1n <dig> infections have resulted in more severe illness in young, previously healthy individuals, which is atypical for seasonal influenza virus isolates  <cit> .

currently licensed antiviral compounds against influenza virus  interfere with specific functions of viral proteins and are one defense against seasonal and newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses. however, the sudden increase in oseltamivir-resistant seasonal h1n <dig> virus strains in 2007– <dig>  <cit>  and the existence of resistant ph1n <dig> virus isolates  <cit>  strongly underscore the urgent need for the development of novel strategies to alleviate influenza virus-induced disease. as an alternative to directly inhibiting viral proteins, aspects of the host response that strongly correlate with host pathology could be targeted to reduce the overall severity of infection. such therapies may be more robust against the emergence of drug-resistant strains because they do not target influenza virus-specific gene products, which are subject to drug-mediated selective pressure. therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to influenza virus pathogenesis is needed to provide the basis for the development of novel host-modulatory therapies. we have reported that a ph1n <dig> isolate  is more pathogenic than a seasonal h1n <dig> isolate in several mammalian models, including cynomolgus macaques  <cit> . specifically, ca04-infected macaques exhibited higher body temperatures, more efficient virus replication in both the upper respiratory tract and lungs, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines , and more severe lung lesions at both early  and late  times post-infection. in addition, we observed an increased presence of inflammatory infiltrates in alveolar spaces and more abundant viral antigen staining of both type i and type ii pneumocytes. these pathological characteristics are similar to those that distinguish highly pathogenic avian h5n <dig> and  <dig> influenza viruses from lower pathogenicity isolates  <cit> , suggesting a common host response theme that may contribute to increased pathogenicity phenotypes for diverse influenza viruses. however, the specific mechanisms underlying the severity of ca <dig> virus pathogenicity remain to be fully elucidated.

in this study, we undertook a unique bioinformatics approach to identify host processes that might be responsible for the enhanced pathology of ca <dig> in macaques. other studies have used microarray analysis in conjunction with bioinformatics tools  or david  <cit> ) to dissect the response to influenza virus infection, primarily at the level of the outcome of host signaling   <cit> . however, these studies typically have used such tools in isolation, and largely have not attempted to predict causative regulatory influences mediated by factors existing outside of the primary dataset. here, we have combined process-level and cell-specific functional enrichment analyses of highly differentially expressed transcripts in ca04-infected lung tissues, identification of putative transcription factors involved in regulating differential expression, canonical pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interactions to develop an integrated pathogenicity-associated host response network. this novel approach revealed not only differentially regulated pathways and differences in immune cell populations that correlate with enhanced ca <dig> pathogenicity, but importantly, also identified critical regulatory intermediaries between these correlates. we suggest that the resulting network can be systematically explored for novel therapeutic intervention.

RESULTS
ca <dig> may promote inflammation through increased expression of chemotactic molecules and caspase- <dig> induction and suppression of glutathione s-transferase  expression
the ca <dig> virus induces more severe lesions in the lungs of cynomolgus macaques relative to a seasonal influenza virus isolate   <cit> . to identify host functions and pathway activity that might explain this difference, we compared the global transcriptional response of ca04- and kutk4-infected lung tissues derived from the animals reported in  <cit> . microarray analysis of rna isolated from within gross lesions identified  <dig> differentially expressed  transcripts between the two infections on day  <dig> p.i. and  <dig> de transcripts on day  <dig> p.i. more than half of the de transcripts from day  <dig> were also de on day  <dig>  and the overlap between time points was significant . a table summarizing the de test results is shown in additional file  <dig>  and total lists of de transcripts from days  <dig> and  <dig> are available in additional file  <dig>  it is important to note that, while lung lesion severity varied between samples , principle component analysis did not identify any relationships between the samples based on lesion severity .

we first focused on genes commonly associated with inflammation and apoptosis . enhanced up-regulation of interferon -stimulated genes  was observed on day  <dig> and day  <dig> p.i., indicating that ca <dig> induced more robust type i ifn signaling than did kutk <dig> . on day  <dig> p.i., three chemokines  were more up-regulated with ca <dig> infection; and these together with four others  were also more up-regulated on day  <dig>  in general, the up-regulated chemokines perform pleiotropic recruitment activities against multiple immune cell subtypes; however, ccl <dig> and ccl3l <dig> exhibit potent chemotactic activity toward monocytes  <cit> . on day  <dig>  we also observed enhanced expression of chemokine receptors that are abundant on monocytes , interleukins that are primarily expressed and secreted by macrophages  and molecules that regulate lymphocyte activities . collectively, these observations are consistent with detailed histopathology analysis of immune cell infiltrates in macaque lungs infected with a similar ph1n <dig> strain  <cit> , and support the suggested involvement of monocyte and lymphocyte sub-populations in the regulation of ca <dig> mediated pathology.

particularly interesting was the observed up-regulation of caspase  <dig>  in ca04-infected lungs. casp <dig> is converted to its active form by the inflammasome signaling complex, which is activated by influenza virus infection  <cit> . in turn, casp <dig> cleaves latent il1β and il <dig> leading to the secretion of the activated forms of these pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . consistent with increased casp <dig> expression, il1β and il <dig> protein concentrations were elevated in the lungs of  <dig> of  <dig> ca04-infected macaques at day  <dig> . taken together, these observations are indicative of increased inflammasome activity in ca <dig> infections.

among the ca04-down-regulated transcripts, we observed several members of the cytosolic glutathione s-transferase  protein family . gsts are antioxidant enzymes that participate in the inactivation of secondary metabolites formed as a result of oxidative stress, and thereby serve a protective role in the cell  <cit> . similar suppression of gst transcription was observed in the kidneys of chickens infected with an hpai virus strain  <cit> , and it has been suggested that oxidative stress may be a key pathway involved in lung injury associated with hpai virus infection  <cit> . thus, the ca04-enhanced down-regulation of gst likely promotes oxidative injury in lung tissue.

ca04-infected macaques exhibit enhanced inflammatory and cell cycle gene expression
ipa and david were next used to identify functional differences between ca <dig> and kutk <dig> infections . ipa uses fisher’s exact test to determine the enrichment significance for each function annotated in the ipa database. david, on the other hand, uses clusters of related annotations built from several annotation databases , and calculates the enrichment score of a cluster by averaging unadjusted p-values  of the annotations within the cluster  <cit> . we reasoned that analyzing the ca <dig> pathogenicity-associated de transcripts using both methods would provide increased functional information and/or cross-validation between methods. de transcripts were separated into up-regulated or down-regulated groups  for each time point and analyzed separately. all significantly enriched  ipa functional annotations and david functional clusters are included in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

ipa analysis of up-regulated de transcript identified enrichment for ‘inflammatory response’, ‘immune cell trafficking’, and ‘antigen presentation’ at day  <dig> p.i., consistent with the increased immune cell infiltrates observed in the original pathology examination  <cit> ; no significant clusters were identified in this time point using david analysis . transcripts up-regulated on day  <dig> were enriched for many of the same ipa categories found on day  <dig>  and both ipa and david identified ‘cell cycle’ as being the most highly enriched, up-regulated process on day  <dig>  more specific categories, such as positive or negative regulation of cell cycle, did not provide conclusive evidence as to the effect of the regulation on cell cycle . among the downregulated transcripts, we saw enrichment only with ipa at the  <dig> d p.i. time point, and only in two categories with no obvious connection to the host response to infection  . these results suggest that functional differences between ca <dig> and kutk <dig> initiate early after infection and are amplified later in the infection, while both analyses identified the cell cycle as the most prominently enriched functional annotation for transcripts that were highly de with ca <dig> infection.

ca <dig> infection enhances gene expression associated with both early/innate and late/adaptive immune cell responses
as differences in immune cell subtypes can also be key regulators of pathology, we performed a cell-specific, functional analysis of de genes by using ipa’s specialized functional annotations for disease and discovery. in addition to providing a general description of function for a category of enriched genes, this approach captures details such as the cell or tissue type in which the gene exerts its function and the orientation of regulation. for down-regulated genes on both days, few categories satisfied our enrichment criteria , and no immune cell-specific annotations were enriched. in contrast, the up-regulated gene lists produced more than  <dig> enriched categories for both days, many of which exhibited functions pertaining to the activation, chemoattraction, infiltration and development of specific immune cell subtypes . to obtain a clearer representation of how ca04-induced gene expression influences different immune cell sub-types, we categorized enrichment by cell-type and function and employed a heat map to show how the enrichment was distributed in relation to time . on day  <dig>  the immune cell subtype most prominently affected by ca04-enhanced gene expression was macrophages, for which categories related to activation, accumulation, and chemotaxis were very highly enriched . t lymphocytes and neutrophils were also broadly affected at this time point, although annotations were not as significant as they were for macrophages. in addition, some enrichment was observed for genes affecting the migration of dendritic cells, eosinophils, and natural killer cells. on day  <dig>  no significant terms related to natural killer cells or basophils were observed, and enrichment of the activation and migration of neutrophils was quite minor, demonstrating that several aspects of the innate immune response had tapered. instead, we found high enrichment for b lymphocyte proliferation and broad enrichment in categories associated with t lymphocyte chemotaxis, infiltration, proliferation, activation, and death. in addition, several functions of antigen presenting cells  were more up-regulated in the ca <dig> infection. the original pathology results  <cit>  did not specify the cell types that comprised the enhanced inflammatory infiltrates on day  <dig> in ca04-infected lung tissue, but they did identify an increase in apcs on day  <dig> p.i.  <cit> . these data point to an increased presence and activation of primarily innate immune cell subtypes early after infection, followed by enhanced influx and activity of apcs and adaptive immune cell types in ca04-infected macaque lungs.

inflammatory and apoptotic transcription factor binding sites are enriched in ca04-specific de genes
next, transcription factor activity was determined by identifying transcription factors whose promoter sequences were highly enriched among the genes that were de between the ca <dig> and kutk <dig> infections. we used the gather software tool  <cit>  which matches transcription factors with their experimentally proven binding sites and determines whether there is significant enrichment of a transcription factor binding site within a given gene list. the transcription factors that matched the most highly enriched promoter sequences for each time point after infection are shown in table  <dig> 

* the percentage of genes de on each day that were regulated by each transcription, according to gather®.

day  <dig> promoter sequence enrichment identified interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , forkhead box p <dig> , and hepatic nuclear factor  <dig> . irf <dig> is activated by toll-like receptors and rig-i, and its increased activity likely reflects the increased replication of ca <dig> in macaque lungs observed on day  <dig> p.i.  <cit> . foxp <dig> is a transcription factor specific to a subset of regulatory t lymphocytes that are known for suppressing inflammatory reactions  <cit> . foxp <dig> promoter site enrichment thus implicates regulatory t lymphocytes in the early phase of ca <dig> infection, possibly reflecting an increased requirement to confront the ca04-enhanced inflammatory response. hnf1a has a wide range of functions, but recent evidence suggests that it may serve as a link between metabolic and inflammatory pathways involved in atherosclerosis  <cit> .

on day  <dig>  nuclear transcription factor y alpha , paired box  <dig>  and myc-associated zinc finger protein  transcription factor activities were highly significant. nfya directly induces transcription of many pro-apoptotic genes and is implicated in p53-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . to determine if there was any significant association between the genes regulated by nfya and the genes annotated with ‘cell death’ in ipa, we used a one-sided fisher’s exact test, but we did not observe significant overlap between these gene sets . pax <dig> is a specific marker for b cells  <cit> , and its enrichment is consistent with the enhanced b cell presence and activity suggested by our cell type-specific functional enrichment analysis for day  <dig> . the enriched transcription factor affecting the greatest percentage of ca <dig> de genes was maz, whose regulation is strongly correlated to inflammation and other common inflammatory markers   <cit> . significant overlap was identified between the genes annotated for ‘inflammation response’ by ipa and genes that contained the maz binding sequence, when considering all de genes on day  <dig> , but the overlap was not significant when only considering genes upregulated on day  <dig> . but within the set of upregulated genes, there was a very significant overlap between the maz regulated gene set and the set of genes annotated with “cell cycle” in ipa . this suggests that maz is closely associated to cell cycle activity despite its established role in inflammation. overall, transcription factor enrichment analysis identified several factors involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes, apoptosis and cell cycle, and is consistent with the enriched functional processes observed among the genes that were more de with ca <dig> infection.

network analysis identifies the primary gene expression moderators in ca04-infected tissue
thus far, we have used enrichment analyses to isolate individual processes differently regulated by the ca <dig> virus. next, we applied a network approach to determine the regulatory interactions that may be coordinating gene expression. within the ipa-curated human protein-protein interaction  network, we searched for subnetworks that were highly populated with de genes, and then we used the protein degree  to identify highly connected hub proteins within each subnetwork. hub proteins are often more essential than non-hub proteins  <cit>  and may play critical roles in regulating the network’s overall biological function  <cit> .

an initial assessment allowing for a network size of up to  <dig> members did not identify any significant subnetworks at  <dig> d.p.i.; however, several were detected among de genes on day  <dig>  the most significant of these was highly enriched for ‘cell growth and proliferation’ and ‘inflammatory response’ annotations  and was centered on four hub genes: ifng, myc, il <dig>  cdkn1a . a more restricted analysis – limiting the number of subnetwork members to  <dig> genes – recapitulated this result, yielding three smaller subnetworks with the same hub genes, each enriched for unique biological functions . ifng, an antiviral cytokine with potent macrophage activation activity and immunoregulatory functions in adaptive immunity, exhibited high centrality in a largely upregulated subnetwork that was enriched for ‘cellular movement’  . notably,  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins in this subnetwork were also members of the ‘role of cytokines in mediating communication between immune cells’ canonical pathway , thus implicating ifng as a putative regulator of the increased late adaptive immune response in ca <dig> infections. the second subnetwork, consisting primarily of upregulated genes, was highly enriched for ‘cell cycle’ functions  . interestingly, both the pro-inflammatory cytokine, il <dig>  and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, cdkn1a, appeared as hubs within this subnetwork, suggesting a novel connection between the host inflammatory response and the highly enriched, cell cycle-associated processes that occur in the late stage of infection. cdknia’s involvement further suggests that the broad category of “cell cycle” is likely to be more specifically related to cell cycle arrest, since cdkn1a is a known inhibitor of cell cycle.

the final network  is centered around the myc transcription factor, which was up-regulated in ca <dig> infections, and enriched for ‘cell growth and proliferation’ . generally, myc activity is associated with cell proliferation, but myc overexpression has also been associated with cell cycle arrest  <cit> . as the majority of the genes in this subnetwork were down-regulated in the ca <dig> infection, this suggests that cell proliferation is being suppressed. therefore, network analysis results were consistent with previous enrichment analyses, and further suggested that ifng, il <dig> and cdkn1a may play prominent roles in regulating the severity of ca04-associated disease relative to seasonal influenza virus.

the ca04-kutk <dig> differentially active immune network
finally, we integrated the cell type enrichment and promoter sequence enrichment analysis with the results of the subnetwork analysis into a coherent map of the ca04-induced immune response. to better clarify how critically positioned hub proteins affected canonical pathways, we performed pathway enrichment and selected two significantly enriched pathways – the ‘role of cytokines in mediating communication between immune cells’  and the ‘role of chk proteins in cell cycle checkpoint control’  – for further examination. these pathways were chosen because  they contained several of the genes that mapped to the subnetworks shown in figure  <dig>   the function of these pathways matched the function of the subnetworks and  the pathway was highly enriched for genes de in ca04-infected lung . furthermore, these pathways contain cell-specific expression information for many of the genes involved in this study.

interactions within each pathway were diagrammed, taking into consideration activating and inhibitory relationships . next, we searched the ipa ppi database for interactions linking the pathways, and we identified the maz transcription factor, which, incidentally, was also one of the most enriched transcription factors in the promoter enrichment analysis. specifically, maz activates expression of cdkn1a , thereby controlling cell cycle progression through the g <dig> checkpoint  <cit>  . maz is also activated by both il <dig> and il <dig> through map kinase-dependent phosphorylation in human cells  <cit>  and is a member of the myc complex. thus, maz, in a network context, appears to be a critical intermediary between the identified subnetworks and potentially their biological function.

the newly identified interactions were added to the previously mentioned pathway diagrams, and gene expression and differentially active transcription factors were overlaid to depict the ca04-induced immune response . the viral rna sensing pathway was added since irf <dig> was found to be active in the ca04-infection on day  <dig>  <cit> . the precise cell-type in which cell cycle arrest and maz activity occurs is an open question; therefore, the specific type of infected cell was not clarified in the network, and was labeled only as ‘infected cell’. ca04-enhanced de genes were colored red, and differentially active transcription factors or the cell types their differential activity may represent  were boxed in red  or black . the full names and entrez ids for all genes depicted in figure  <dig> are listed in additional file  <dig> 

in this network, only four genes  were up-regulated on day  <dig> p.i.  and their primary role is the chemoattraction of innate immune cell types . the activity of irf <dig> and regulatory t lymphocytes  was enhanced on day  <dig>  as evidenced by the promoter sequence enrichment . major differences in the immune response network appeared on day  <dig> p.i., with upregulation of additional chemokines and cytokines responsible for the activation and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cells . in particular, interferon gamma , which is important for cytotoxic t cell function and elimination of virus-infected cells, was up-regulated . additionally, upregulation of il <dig> and il <dig>  can lead to b lymphocyte activation, while the presence of b lymphocytes was supported by the enrichment of the pax <dig> promoter sequence . increased immune cell presence and continued il <dig>  production would allow the simultaneous upregulation of maz activity, thereby impacting inflammatory and cell cycle signaling through cdkn1a transcription . the cell cycle is further impacted by maz’s interaction with myc, which we suspect is involved in cell cycle arrest, since many of myc’s target proteins were downregulated during infection . overall, our data identify a novel, transcriptionally active link between influenza-induced inflammation and cell cycle arrest  and suggest that inflammation-induced, maz-dependent cell cycle disruption may be responsible, at least in part, for apoptosis and tissue injury related to influenza virus pathogenicity.

discussion
go and pathway enrichment studies can detail many key aspects of the host response, but these biological functions and processes must be integrated to create host response models capable of linking the effects of transcription to the molecular and signaling events driving those effects. the differentially regulated host response network presented here represents a novel effort to combine various, independent analyses of de genes into a coherent protein-protein/protein-cell type interaction architecture. this approach allowed us to link immune cells and their inflammatory activities with cell cycle regulation through the identification of a transcription factor  that acts as an intermediary between these functional correlates of ph1n <dig> pathogenicity. while many studies have used microarrays to identify global transcriptional changes that characterize the host response to different influenza viruses in different systems, our integrated approach allows for a more specific understanding of the mechanisms of influenza virus-induced pathogenicity.

prior to developing the differential host response network, we validated our transcriptional data by showing that it was, indeed, indicative of the pathological differences between the two infections . initial functional enrichment results confirmed that the biological processes observed during the pathology examination  were also detectable in the transcriptional differences between ca04- and kutk4-infected lung tissue. therefore, it seems very likely that any additional functionality or pathway information derived from these data should have a highly correlative, if not causal, relationship with the enhanced pathology of the ca <dig> infection.

the enhanced ability of the ca <dig> virus to replicate in lung tissue does not lead to large differences in the host response on day  <dig> of the infection. the enhanced irf <dig> transcription factor activity in ca04-infected lung is consistent with the increased toll-like receptor/rig-i signaling one expects when there are increased levels of viral single-stranded rna present in a sample. enhanced chemoattraction of nk cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and macrophages is consistent with the enhanced inflammatory infiltrates observed on histopathologic examination. most interesting is the implied difference in regulatory t lymphocyte populations, evident from foxp <dig> promoter site enrichment, and the potentially enhanced il-1β expression as a result of greater up-regulation of casp <dig> in the ca <dig> infection. regulatory t lymphocytes manage immune system homeostasis, and imbalances in t cell populations are often associated with increased inflammation and immune-mediated cell death  <cit> . the implicated regulatory t lymphocyte population change may be a factor in the enhanced inflammation and cell damage observed in ca04-infected lung tissue on day  <dig> p.i. additionally, increased casp <dig> induction of il-1β could further promote inflammation in ca04-infected tissue.

in a previous study, lung samples infected with a highly pathogenic and mildly pathogenic ph1n <dig> virus were compared to kutk4-infected tissue on day  <dig> p.i., and similar to the work presented here, enhanced inflammation and immune cell infiltration were identified as correlates of increased ph1n <dig> pathogenicity  <cit> . this study found nfκb mediated transcription as a potential mechanism of enhanced pathogenesis, but the degree to which the observed gene regulation was independent of viral replication is unclear. furthermore, of the  <dig> transcripts de on day  <dig> of our study, only  <dig> were also de in the previous work. while this does represent a significant overlap , none of the genes identified as de early in ph1n1-infected lung tissue in both studies are related to the immune response. in all, both studies show that early in the course of the infection, there is no obvious dysregulation of the host response with the potential exception of an imbalance in regulatory t lymphocytes, noted above.

by day  <dig> p.i., several mechanisms up-regulated in ca04-infected lung tissue can account for the continued enhanced pathology  <cit> . lung tissue infected with ca <dig> on day  <dig> p.i. showed sustained activation and accumulation of immune cells despite the absence of replicating virus. in addition to the increased immune cell signaling and the activation of the adaptive immune response  we observed increased enrichment for cell cycle arrest. cell cycle arrest has a complicated relationship with virus replication and the immune response. arrest during g <dig> phase promotes greater influenza virus replication  <cit> , but cell cycle arrest also often occurs in cells prior to apoptosis  <cit> . given that cell cycle arrest was observed late in the infection, this is likely to be a host-controlled event, possibly reflecting severely damaged host cells selecting an apoptotic fate.

the maz transcription factor activity  adds an additional layer of complexity between influenza infection-induced apoptosis, immune cell trafficking, and the observed cell cycle arrest. maz increases cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a  expression  <cit>  and is known to regulate myc transcription  <cit>  – two molecules with seemingly opposed effects on cell cycle. increased cdkn1a transcription leads to cell cycle arrest and the production of serum amyloid a , which in turn leads to increased recruitment of immune cells to inflammatory sites  <cit> . increased myc transcription is most often associated with increased proliferation but it has also been linked to increased cell cycle arrest in fibroblasts  <cit> . since the cell proliferation enriched subnetwork holds myc in a highly central position , the evidence suggests that the increased maz transcription is simultaneously inducing cell cycle arrest via cdkn1a and myc pathways. since lymphocytes typically proliferate in organized lymphoid tissue  and our samples were collected from within infected lung lesions, we suggest that regulation of cell cycle gene expression primarily occurs in infected epithelium or pneumocytes. lastly, the fact that virus could not be isolated on day  <dig> for ca <dig> infected-lung tissue suggests that activation of the maz pathway may be in response to an overly aggressive immune response rather than virus replication. further, while maz protein levels are directly correlated with chronic inflammation, the anti-inflammatory suppression of ccl <dig> transcription by cdkn1a  <cit>  was not observed in our microarray data. thus, there are multiple interactions involving maz which we feel are suitable targets to mitigate inflammation during moderate to highly pathogenic influenza infections. further study validating the significance of maz transcription to local inflammation is warranted.

the differentially regulated network developed here elucidates differences between a low pathogenic and a moderately pathogenic infection, and is likely a suitable model of enhanced pathology in humans, as macaque models of influenza virus infection are considered to be one of the best surrogates of human infection  <cit> . several chemokines and interleukins that are up-regulated in the ca <dig> infection are also up-regulated in the lungs of macaques infected with hpai h5n <dig> virus  <cit> ; however, promoter enrichment analysis of avian virus-infected lung tissue may be needed to provide greater clarity on the precise mechanisms active during a highly pathogenic infection. ultimately, we intend to develop a mathematical model that can quickly identify the correlates of pathogenicity from microarray experiments to equate transcriptional regulation to infection severity in humans. the network presented here is the first step toward developing such a model.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, ca04-infected macaque lungs showed a prolonged immune response that continued beyond the duration of the local virus infection. the failure of the negative feedback mechanism that exists between maz, cdkn1a, and macrophage cell migration  could have caused this prolonged inflammation, thereby promoting enhanced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. the interplay between maz induction, immune cell signaling, and inflammation must be finely tuned, and failure to maintain an appropriate, balanced response between these three factors could explain, at least in part, the increased pathogenicity of ca <dig> and other ph1n <dig> viruses. further studies are needed to address the interchange between maz, the cell cycle, and the immune response, as well as the effects of this interplay on influenza virus-induced disease pathology. overall, our strategy of linking functional annotations to the protein-protein interaction networks is suitable for identifying the key mechanisms driving the observed phenotypes.
