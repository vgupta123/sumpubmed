BACKGROUND
plants display sophisticated sensing and signaling systems which elicit a variety of responses to environmental signals such as drought or osmotic stress, and to plant hormones including cytokinin. the resulting intracellular signal transduction relies notably on phosphorylation events, which are mediated by multistep phosphorelay signaling. this system involves three components: a hybrid histidine-aspartate kinase  receptor, histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins  and response regulators . one of the best characterized corresponding systems is the osmo-responsive pathway operating in yeast. this system is composed of the hk receptor, sln1p, the hpt, ypd1p and the rr, ssk1p  <cit> . the phosphorelay consists in transferring phosphate from his-to-asp residues between the different partners. under hyper-osmolarity conditions, sln1p is inactive and unphosphorylated, leading to the accumulation of unphosphorylated cytoplasmic rr ssk1p. this active form of ssk1p is then able to activate the hog <dig> map kinase pathway that induces genes expression, leading to cell protection by glycerol synthesis. in arabidopsis thaliana, multistep phosphorelay members similar to the one found in yeast are involved in signaling pathways: arabidopsis histidine kinases , arabidopsis histidine-phosphotransfer proteins  and arabidopsis response regulators   <cit> . the ahk family consists of six hybrid histidine protein kinases, ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  ahk <dig> , ahk <dig> and cki <dig>  these latters, cki <dig> and ahk <dig>  are involved in megagametophyte development  <cit>  and stomatal closure  <cit>  respectively. this family also includes the cytokinin receptors ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  <cit>  and ahk <dig> which is the first partner of the osmosensing pathway displaying an osmosensor function in both models, yeast and arabidopsis <cit> . this latter also plays a role in the regulation of desiccation processes during seed maturation  <cit> . contrary to ahk <dig>  cytokinin receptors ahk <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> function as negative regulators of osmotic stress  <cit> . concerning the second partner,  <dig> ahps mediate the phosphorelay between ahks and arrs. urao et al. found that the osmosensor receptor, ahk <dig>  is only able to interact with one hpt protein ahp <dig>  <cit> . an interaction network study of multistep phosphorelay signaling pathway members performed by yeast two-hybrid assays showed interactions of ahp <dig> with some arrs  <cit> . on the basis of a structural comparaison of amino acid sequences, the members of the arr family were subdivided into four distinct groups including a-type, b-type, c-type and pseudo-rrs  <cit> . among these groups, the b-type rr family members are assumed to function as crucial transcriptional regulators in the his-to-asp phosphorelay signal transduction network. such rrs are composed of a phosphate receiver domain with the conserved d-d-k motif , and a large c-terminal extension mediating sequence specific dna-binding domain referred to originally as the b motif  <cit> . according to riechmann’s classification  <cit> , the b motif appears to be a representative of the plant single myb-related domains, which belong to the garp subfamily. the garp domain or b motif is specific to transcription factors found only in plant, and its name derives from its discovery inside the maize golden <dig> gene sequence, the b-type arr proteins from arabidopsis, and psr <dig> from chlamydomonas <cit> . the c-terminal extension contains a transcriptional activation region which is rich both in proline and glutamine residues, as it is usually met in transcriptional activators  <cit>  and also nuclear localization signals  responsible for the b-type rrs targeting to the nucleus  <cit> . within the eleven members of b-type rr family identified in arabidopsis , some interacting partners of ahp <dig>  <cit>  have been shown to be associated with cytokinin signal transduction  <cit> . this signal is relayed from membrane to nucleus where these rrs function as transcription factors that operate in the last step of the primary cytokinin response pathway. although b-type rr genes expression is not cytokinin inducible, b-type rrs function as positive regulators of the cytokinin signaling pathway  <cit>  by enhancing transcription of cytokinin target genes, including a-type arrs  <cit> , which act in turn as negative regulators allowing a feedback control of the pathway  <cit> . while b-type rrs involvement in cytokinin signaling pathway has been studied in detail, little is known about their role in osmosensing signaling pathway in other plants than arabidopsis and more particularly in woody plants. in populus trichocarpa,  <dig> a-type,  <dig> b-type,  <dig> c-type and  <dig> pseudo rrs have been identified to date  <cit> . a transcriptomic analysis revealed that some genes corresponding to cytokinin signaling pathway components  were regulated during shoot organogenesis in hybrid poplar 717-1b <dig> genotype  <cit> . moreover, in the same genotype, ramirez-carvajal et al.  <cit> , showed that rr <dig> acted downstream of cytokinin pathway by repressing adventitious root formation. in poplar dorskamp genotype, we identified a putative osmosensor, hk <dig>  <cit> , as well as ten hpts . a recent study led us to propose hpt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as specific partners of hk <dig> in the populus osmosensing signaling pathway  <cit> .

to characterize in more detail the molecular mechanisms involved in the poplar osmosensing pathway, we undertook to analyze potential interactions of the three hpt partners of hk <dig>  with the different b-type rrs. as a consequence, we isolated eight b-type rrs in our poplar genotype and performed interaction tests by yeast two-hybrid  and bimolecular fluorescence complementation  assays. these tests showed that the three hpts interact with eight b-type rrs and presented distinct interaction profiles based on different level of reporter gene activation. the interaction study in planta for some b-type rrs by bifc assays confirmed a nuclear localization of hpt/b-rr interactions. the co-expression of some b-type rr and hpt transcripts in same poplar organs led us to highlight five of them as potential partners for these three hpt proteins.

RESULTS
isolation of eight poplar b-type response regulators
on the basis of populus genomic resources, we isolated eight cdnas encoding b-type rrs from a root cdna library: rr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . we did not succeed in isolating rr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  deduced amino acid sequences of these newly isolated poplar b-type rrs share a common structural design composed of the phospho-accepting receiver domain, the garp dna-binding domain and two putative nlss. the phylogenetic relationships of these b-type rrs with those of model plant species, arabidopsis thaliana , zea mays , glycine max , and oryza sativa , are represented by a rooted tree based on the alignment of b-type rr full-length amino acid sequences . such analysis revealed that the different b-type rr family members are interspersed in distinct groups independent of species but in most cases, are classified within groups in species-specific pairs.


hpt <dig>  hpt <dig> and hpt <dig> interact with a subset of b-type response regulators in yeast
to study interactions of the three hpts of interest  with the eight isolated b-type rrs, we conducted a y2h analysis. since b-type rr expression in the “bait” configuration led to a strong autoactivation of the first reporter gene  , all the b-type rrs were used as a “prey” while the three hpts tested were cloned in the “bait” vector. this analysis revealed interactions of the three hpts with seven b-type rrs: rr <dig>  rr <dig>  rr <dig>  rr <dig>  rr <dig>  rr <dig> and rr <dig>  no interaction was detected between hpts and rr <dig> using this system . these results were confirmed by the estimation of the ß-galactosidase activity corresponding to the second reporter gene activation . as a control of the interaction background, we used each plex-hpt in combination with the empty pgad vector that did not result in significant ß-galactosidase activity. as expected, similar low levels of activity were also obtained when testing the interaction of the three hpts with rr <dig>  by contrast, we observed that the other rrs interacted significantly with the three hpts. indeed, for hpt <dig> and  <dig> similar patterns of interaction were revealed including a strong ß-galactosidase activity for rr <dig>  and an intermediate one for rr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and a weaker one for rr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  on the other hand, hpt <dig> presented an interaction pattern separating rrs in two groups, the first one with a strong ß-galactosidase activity  and the second one exhibiting a weaker activity .


hpt/rr interactions occur in the nuclear compartment
to confirm and localize in planta the hpt/rr interactions observed in y2h assays, we tested whether hpts can interact with b-type rrs using bifc assays in catharanthus roseus cells. for such analysis, four detected interactions in the y2h system were tested: hpt2/rr <dig>  hpt2/rr <dig>  hpt9/rr <dig> and hpt9/rr <dig>  furthermore, in order to substantiate the lack of hpt/rr <dig> interaction in yeast, bifc assays were conducted to test the interaction between rr <dig> and hpt <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in planta. hpt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  rr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> coding sequences were fused either to the n-terminal  or c-terminal  fragments of yellow fluorescent protein  at their n-terminal end to produce: yfpn-hpts, yfpc-hpts and yfpn-rrs, yfpc-rrs. during co-transformation experiments, the different combinations of hpt <dig> and rr <dig> or rr <dig> constructs led to the formation of a bifc complex within plant cells . this signal perfectly merged with the fluorescence of the cyan fluorescent protein  nucleus marker  indicating the nuclear localization of this interaction. similar constructs, utilized to test the interactions hpt9/rr <dig> and hpt9/rr <dig> using bifc assays, revealed a yfp reconstitution in both cases . both interaction combinations displayed a nuclear fluorescence signal, as demonstrated by the co-localization with the signal of the co-expressed cfp nucleus marker . as regards rr <dig>  the formation of a bifc complex within plant cells was observed in case of interaction with hpt <dig> , hpt <dig>  and hpt <dig> . this signal also perfectly merged with the cfp nucleus marker  indicating the nuclear localization of these three interactions. as a positive control, bifc complex reconstitution was visualized when co-expressing the fusion proteins bzip-yfpn and bzip-yfpc, confirming a nuclear localization of homodimers of this known transcription factor . by contrast, no yfp reconstitution could be visualized when co-expressing the fusion proteins yfpc-hpt <dig>  yfpn-hpt <dig>  yfpn-rr <dig>  yfpc-rr <dig>  yfpn or yfpc-rr <dig> with the fusion protein bzip-yfpc or bzip-yfpn , thereby validating the specificity of interaction between b-type rrs  and hpts  in planta. this interaction study confirmed in planta some of the interactions detected by y2h analysis, between rr <dig> or rr <dig> and hpt <dig> or hpt <dig>  in contrast to y2h system, bifc assays highlighted the ability of rr <dig> to interact with the three hpts of interest. the totality of these hpt/rr interactions occurs in the nuclear compartment.


the nuclear localization of these interactions prompted us to examine the subcellular localization of these different partners, hpt <dig>  hpt <dig>  rr <dig> and rr <dig>  using transient expression of gfp-fusion proteins within c. roseus cells. this study showed that hpt <dig>  and hpt <dig>  gfp-fusion proteins displayed both a nuclear and cytosolic localization as illustrated by a perfect merge of fluorescence with the mcherry nucleo-cytosolic marker . by contrast, the rr <dig>  and rr <dig>  gfp-fusion proteins were exclusively localized into the nucleus as demonstrated by the co-localization of the gfp fluorescent signal with the signal of the co-expressed mcherry nuclear marker  validating the rr <dig> and rr <dig> nuclear localization.


expression profile of b-type rrs transcripts in populus
the physiological existence of the interactions observed between hpts and b-type rrs relies on the concomitant presence in plant organs of both partners. as a consequence, the distribution of the transcripts of each protein has been evaluated by rt-pcr approaches. for this purpose, rnas were extracted from various organs  of poplar cuttings in control or stressed conditions  and reverse transcribed. the resultant cdnas were amplified by pcr using specific primers  for each b-type rrs and clathrin gene was used as control . while the transcripts of rr <dig> were detected in all organs and conditions following  <dig> cycles of amplification ,  <dig> additional cycles were needed to detect in all organs and conditions the transcripts of rr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . by contrast, the transcripts of rr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were not detected in these conditions . this analysis suggests that among all poplar b-type rrs, the transcripts of rr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are more expressed than the others with a more marked expression for rr <dig>  besides, under the conditions of our study, the osmotic constraint applied did not allow to detect marked variations in transcripts expression whatever the b-type rrs studied.


discussion
the b-type response regulators are the final output elements of the his-to-asp phosphorelay system. in spite of a systematic identification and characterization of the different partners belonging to these systems in arabidopsis, zea mays, glycine max, and oryza sativa, only few members of these systems from herbaceous plants have been identified as drought-related actors. in arabidopsis, it has been demonstrated that the hybrid histidine-aspartate kinase, ahk <dig>  is a positive regulator of osmotic stress signaling and that ahk <dig> gene expression is regulated by salt stress and dehydration  <cit> . moreover, among three authentic ahps , only ahp <dig> was shown to be an interacting partner of this osmosensor  <cit> . however, the b-type rr interacting partners of ahp <dig>  <cit>  clearly play a pivotal role in the response to cytokinin  <cit>  or to ethylene  <cit> . until now, very few information is available concerning an interaction network between osmotic stress signaling partners belonging to the multistep phosphorelay system.

the aim of the present study was to determine, in populus, the potential third partners in osmotic stress signaling by bringing out interactions between b-type rrs and three hpts main interacting partners of the putative osmosensor hk <dig>  based on a homology approach, we isolated eight cdnas, from the poplar dorskamp genotype, encoding rrs sharing the common features of b-type rr family members. a phylogenetic analysis of poplar b-type rrs and several rrs from other model plant species revealed that in most cases, b-type rr family members can be classified independently of species but present pairings within species. in arabidopsis, based on sequence comparisons and expression patterns, the b-type rrs have been divided into three sub-groups: bi, the largest sub-group that contains arr involved in cytokinin responses  <cit> , bii and biii represented respectively by the pairs arr13/arr <dig> and arr19/arr <dig>  <cit> . our rooted tree produced the same global scheme: the b-type rrs of the sub-group bi of arabidopsis clustered together notably with a high number of b-type rrs from the other species and more particularly with isolated poplar b-type rrs.

we did not succeed in isolating rr <dig> or  <dig> which belong to the sub-group ii, or the rr <dig> of sub-group i. nevertheless, as shown in p. trichocarpa genotype, rr <dig> and rr <dig> are not expressed in roots  <cit> , in agreement with our difficulties in isolating them. on the other hand, in the dorskamp genotype, we isolated rr <dig> but not rr <dig>  which were undetected and detected respectively in p. trichocarpa genotype. these differential expressions of b-type rrs observed in p. trichocarpa and p. deltoides  marsh x p. nigra l. dorskamp genotypes could be explained by their genetic variability.

to identify the partners potentially involved in the osmosensing pathway, we performed a global interaction analysis in yeast between hpts , the main partners of hk <dig>  and the eight isolated b-type rrs. both qualitative approaches used allowed us to obtain an overview of b-type rr partners of these hpts. except for rr <dig>  strong interactions between all b-type rrs and the three hpts were detected with different interaction profiles. based on different activation levels of the second reporter gene , three rr groups emerged for hpt <dig> and hpt <dig>  while the rrs are divided into two groups for hpt <dig> 

to substantiate the partnership observed by y2h analysis, some hpt/rr interactions were also analyzed in planta using bifc assays. among interactions observed in yeast, two hpts and two b-type rrs were chosen: i) hpt <dig> and hpt <dig>  that present the strongest interaction with hk <dig> and seem to be key actors of the osmosensing pathway on the basis of their expression profiles in populus <cit> , ii) rr <dig> and rr <dig>  that display strong or weak β-galactosidase activity with the three hpts, respectively. these bifc assays demonstrated that hpt <dig> and hpt <dig> interact with rr <dig> or rr <dig> in the c. roseus cells. in arabidopsis, an interaction study concerning cytokinin response factors  and other members of cytokinin signaling pathway showed that bifc technique led to a more complete detection of interactions than with the y2h method  <cit> . based on this study and due to the lack of hpt <dig>   <dig>  9/rr <dig> interactions observed in y2h system, we decided to complete the interaction study by testing the ability of rr <dig> to interact in planta with hpts. as for the crfs study, the bifc analysis showed that rr <dig> displayed interactions with hpt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cutcliff et al.  <cit> , speculated that the lack of some interaction in y2h system can be explained by the absence of plant specific post-translational modifications on protein or plant-specific protein facilitating the interactions of this protein. the whole of hpt/rr interactions in planta occurs in the nucleus. to validate this study, we confirmed that hpt <dig> and  <dig> have a nuclear and cytosolic localization while the rr <dig> and  <dig> are localized in the nucleus. although the localization of the second and third partners has already been described in arabidopsis <cit> , and that the nuclear localization of hpt/b-type rr interactions is expected, the localization of these interactions was until now only putative. our study shows clearly this localization for the first time in plant cell.

to reinforce the hypothesis of interactions between the second and third partners in planta, an analysis of the concomitant presence of the transcripts of both partners  in the same plant organs was performed. a previous analysis of expression of hk <dig> and hpt genes in four different organs of poplar cuttings under control and osmotic stress conditions revealed that only hk <dig>  hpt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are co-expressed in all organs and conditions tested  <cit> . in the present study, we also analyzed the b-type rr genes expression in the same poplar cuttings organs and conditions, which led us to show that only rr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are expressed in the same organs and conditions than hk <dig> and the three hpts. by contrast to hpts, none b-type rr showed an organo-specific expression. however, the absence of rr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts in organs and conditions tested, even though they are able to interact physically with hpts in yeast, allows us to conclude that these b-type rrs are of lesser importance in the osmosensing signaling pathway in these organs.

the five poplar b-type rrs, rr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  interacting with hpt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the predominant partners of hk <dig>  and concomitantly expressed in the main organs of poplar, could be probably involved in a poplar osmosensing pathway. nevertheless, some arabidopsis b-type rrs homologous to these five poplar rrs are transcription factors of cytokinin or ethylene signaling pathways, such as arr <dig> involved in leaf senescence  <cit> , ethylene response  <cit>  and resistance against pathogens  <cit> . consequently, these transcription factors would behave as a set of protagonists linking several signaling pathways to coordinate different developmental processes and stress responses  <cit> . this hypothesis is consistent with the known cross-talk between cytokinin, aba and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, eight b-type rrs have been identified in populus . in yeast, almost all b-type rrs tested  present interactions with the three preferential partners, hpt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  of hk <dig>  a putative poplar osmosensor. some hpt/rr interactions were confirmed in planta by bifc assays and the ability of rr <dig> to interact with hpts was only detected in planta. all tested hpt/rr interactions displayed a nuclear localization, hpts being nuclear and cytosolic proteins, and b-type rrs nuclear proteins. the co-expression of the downstream signaling partners in poplar organs highlights the relevance of rr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as potential third partners involved in the osmosensing pathway in populus. however, their specific implications in transcription of osmotic stress response genes remain to be investigated.
