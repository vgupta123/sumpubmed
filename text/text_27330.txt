BACKGROUND
aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous fungus that can be isolated from habitats such as soil or compost  <cit> . in the last decades, it has become the primary mold pathogen of humans. especially in immunocompromised patients, the fungus is responsible for life-threatening infections. such invasive aspergillosis  is associated with a mortality rate of up to 90%  <cit> . the small size of spores permits ready access to the lung alveoli, which are the primary site of infection. a. fumigatus is highly thermotolerant, surviving temperatures of up to 70°c. factors which convey thermo- and stress resistance at high temperature may also contribute to the virulence of this mold  <cit> . however, only few genes have been shown to be involved in thermotolerance of a. fumigatus so far and no direct link to virulence was found yet. a strain lacking the o-mannosyltransferase gene afpmt <dig> was shown to be impaired in growth above 37°c  <cit>  but did not show attenuation in virulence. a similar phenotype was shown for the thermotolerance protein thta, the function of which is unknown  <cit> . the nucleolar protein cgra that is involved in ribosome biogenesis was shown to be essential for growth at 37°c in vitro and in infected mice, but was dispensable at 22°c  <cit> . thermoresistance in a. fumigatus, therefore, is polygenic and mediated by numerous factors. for this reason, global studies are required to identify sets of transcripts or proteins, which are important for growth at elevated temperatures. furthermore, a comparison of the heat shock response of a. fumigatus to that in other fungi may reveal differences that help to explain its thermotolerance.

the heat shock response of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is the best characterised both on the transcriptome and proteome level  <cit> . one of the primary effects of heat shock in this organism is un- and refolding of misfolded proteins which is mediated by heat shock proteins . moreover, the expression of genes or proteins involved in cell wall integrity, cytoskeleton organisation, small molecular and vesicular transport, energy generation, defense against oxidative stress, signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism, ubiquitination, and proteolysis are induced.

the heat and general stress response in yeast is regulated by the transcription factors hsf <dig>  msn2/msn <dig> and hac <dig>  the transcriptional regulator hsf <dig> binds to specific repeat sequences  termed heat shock elements . upon heat shock, hsf <dig> induces the expression of chaperones and many other genes . the second regulatory system of the heat shock response consists of msn <dig> and msn <dig>  they play central roles in response to several stresses by activating gene expression via the stress response element  . the third component is hac <dig>  this transcription factor activates the expression of genes the products of which promote protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum  and degradation of incorrectly folded proteins .

in a. fumigatus, the global regulatory network induced upon heat shock has so far only been investigated on the transcriptome level  <cit> . to gain further insight into the heat shock response of a. fumigatus at the level of the proteome, we applied 2d-fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis . this technique is superior to classical gel-based proteomics approaches. it enables separating different samples labelled with spectrally resolvable fluorescent dyes on the same 2d gel. this reduces experimental gel-to-gel variation and provides increased statistical confidence. however, raw dige data still reflect technical and biological variation. additionally, missing intensity values may be a problem, depending on the software used for gel image analysis  <cit> . it was shown that the normalization methods of commercial software are not able to eliminate all bias and produce different results depending on the image analysis software used  <cit> . therefore, several attempts have been made to reduce noise and to improve the quality of datasets by various statistical methods  <cit> .

here, we characterized the protein expression of a. fumigatus following a temperature shift from 30°c to 48°c. this rise in temperature induces a clear heat shock response in a. fumigatus and corresponds to temperature conditions in compost piles. data analysis was optimized by imputing missing intensity values and subsequent data normalisation. additionally, transcriptome and sequence information was used to achieve a comprehensive view of the a. fumigatus heat shock response. furthermore, we compared our data with global studies of other fungi to elucidate possible factors which may distinguish a thermotolerant mold from mesophilic species. our study revealed novel putative hsf1-targets in a. fumigatus.

RESULTS
experimental design
the dige technique has the advantage of increasing replicate number whilst keeping the number of 2d gels required relatively low. it allows multiplexing of up to three samples, labeled with spectrally resolvable fluorescent dyes , in one gel  <cit> . the co-migration of proteins in one gel eliminates running differences between those samples. the additional use of a pooled internal standard results in better inter- and intra-gel matching of spots. it has been shown that this technique is able to generate statistically significant data with fewer 2d gels than traditional 2d gel electrophoresis  <cit> . furthermore, the application of cydyes ensures a linear detection over a wide range of protein abundance with around four orders of magnitude  <cit> . applying the reference design , as most studies do, results in the use of half of the gels for measuring the reference. loop design , is more suitable, because it reduces cost and experimental effort and, at the same time, it produces statistically sound data  <cit> . extended loop design  has the additional advantage of high intersample connectivity.

in this study, reference and extended loop design were applied. loop design resulted in less missing data than reference design . therefore, more data could be used for further analyses . this also resulted in the detection of more significant differentially regulated spots . because of this, we focused on the data generated by application of the extended loop design.

image and data analysis
imputation methods were selected from a set of described approaches which have previously been applied to proteomic datasets . the quality of these methods was assessed by several tests. the combination of minimal imputation and k-nearest neighbors was found to perform best  <cit> . it defines spots appearing in less than 25% of the gels of one experimental condition as noise. present spot values from similarly regulated spots are used for imputing missing data of spots with less than 25% missing values across all gels. to our knowledge, the combination of these two methods was used and evaluated here for the first time and is also eligible for other dige studies.

the normalization procedure, using variance stabilization  first and local polynomial regression  subsequently, was tested against no normalization, decyder standard normalization and normalization using only vsn or loess. the newly introduced combination of vsn and loess produced the best result in terms of noise reduction  <cit> .

the whole data analysis workflow is publicly available as tool dige analyzer within the data warehouse omnifung  <cit>  at http://www.omnifung.hki-jena.de/rpad/dige_analyzer.rpad. also, all experimental data produced in this study are stored in this data warehouse and are available by public login.

differentially regulated proteins at high temperature
preliminary 2d-gel electrophoresis studies revealed only a small change in protein expression following an increase of the cultivation temperature from 30°c to 37°c . concordantly, transcriptome analysis of temperature shift experiments revealed a higher expression of heat-shock responsive genes following a shift from 30°c to 48°c in comparison to 37°c  <cit> . we therefore decided to focus our protein expression studies on the heat shock response at 48°c . this also allows a better comparison of data from less thermotolerant, mesophilic fungi, such as s. cerevisiae, where a temperature of 37°c already induces a clear heat shock response.

 <dig> spots were detected in the gels . a set of  <dig> spots was analyzed further.  <dig> of them, representing  <dig> different proteins, were identified by ms . the number of differently expressed proteins is similar to previous 2d-gel electrophoresis studies of the heat shock response in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , penicillium marneffei  <cit>  and aspergillus flavus  <cit> . all spots representing the same protein  showed a very similar regulation. therefore, the median value of these spots was calculated for each time point to define a protein as up- or downregulated.  <dig> proteins appeared to be upregulated, whereas  <dig> showed downregulation . the putative functions identified for these proteins can be divided into several groups: many proteins have functions in protein folding , in the organization of the cytoskeleton, transcription, translation and the oxidative stress response. the flavohemoprotein afua_4g <dig> acts as an no detoxification enzyme  <cit>  and the nitroreductase family protein afua_5g <dig> has a putative role in maintaining the cellular oxidative and/or nitrosative balance  <cit> . the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2a is presumably involved in hyphal growth  <cit>  and in the repression of rna-polymerase iii transcription of rrna and trna  <cit> . in addition, a large group of differentially regulated proteins was involved in amino acid biosynthesis and in carbohydrate metabolism: enzymes of glycolysis , tca cycle , pentose phosphate pathway , mannose metabolism , lipid biosynthesis , and an nadp-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase were affected by heat shock.

relative protein abundance is depicted as log2-ratio. logarithmized normalized intensities of the respective time points were subtracted by logarithmized normalized intensity of time point t =  <dig>  osc describes whether the protein is oscillatingly regulated.

the  <dig> significant differentially regulated and identified proteins were grouped according to qualitative features of their time courses. in grouping, up- and downregulation was discriminated. both groups of proteins were subdivided into oscillating and non-oscillating proteins. a protein was defined as being oscillating when the slope of its time course changed its algebraic sign twice, once at  <dig> or  <dig> minutes  and once at  <dig> minutes . additionally, the difference between the log2-ratios of a spot at these time points had to be larger than the standard deviation of the log2-ratios from the whole time course of this spot . the grouping is in agreement with clusters calculated by fuzzy c-means algorithm  for the corresponding transcriptomic data  <cit> . chaperones were mostly non-oscillating upregulated, as were proteins involved in defense against oxidative stress and signal transduction. also, most of the downregulated proteins were non-oscillating. proteins of the metabolism as well as of transcription and translation were upregulated in an oscillating manner.

in addition to the manual annotation of the differentially regulated proteins with a functional class as described above, funcat categorization  <cit>  was conducted. most affected proteins have binding functions or need cofactors and are related to metabolism, cell rescue, defence and virulence or protein fate. since the categories on the top level of funcat are quite broad, an enrichment analysis was conducted on the second level. the following categories displayed a p-value below  <dig>  : protein folding and stabilization, nucleotide binding, stress response, protein binding, animal cell type differentiation, translation, cell death, phosphate metabolism, assembly of protein complexes, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, fungal/microorganismic development, tricarboxylic-acid pathway , aminoacyl-trna synthetases, cellular sensing and response, complex cofactor/cosubstrate binding, protein targeting, sorting and translocation, nucleus, and anaplerotic reactions. this enrichment shows that although many proteins belonged to the category metabolism, non-metabolic categories are more important in the process of heat shock. funcat categories of different hierarchical levels for all differentially regulated proteins as well as all p-values of the enrichment test at level two can be found in additional file  <dig> .

relation of transcriptome and proteome data
whole genome analysis of only transcriptome or proteome data remains a reductionist approach, since both levels are strongly intertwined. to achieve a more holistic view, we analyzed previously published transcriptomic information. for half of the significant differentially regulated proteins the respective transcript was also found to be significantly regulated.

low correlation of transcripts and corresponding proteins has been reported  <cit> . in this study, linear relationships were examined by pearson correlation  and non-linear relationships by spearman correlation . median correlation for the whole time series of the  <dig> transcripts and respective proteins was - <dig>   and - <dig>  . these values resulted from the fact that the expression of many proteins correlated negatively with their corresponding transcripts . pc ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig> , sc from - <dig>  to  <dig> . both correlations depicted  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs of protein spots and transcripts showing negative values. only  <dig>  pairs showed good correlation . this means that most proteins seemed to be upregulated while their respective transcript was downregulated and vice versa. since negative correlation between so many transcripts and their corresponding proteins is counterintuitive, a model of time delay was introduced. a protein is most probably not regulated at exactly the same time point as its transcript due to the fact that translation follows transcription. therefore, the contradictory behavior of a protein in respect to its transcript can be the result of earlier events, before heat shock was applied. by analyzing time-shifted correlation between transcriptomic and respective proteomic data, it was found that different proteins showed different time delays . a maximum delay of  <dig> minutes was allowed. using this approach, all pc between a transcript and its respective protein became greater than  <dig>  and the median correlation was good with a value of  <dig> . median correlation of sc was  <dig> . four scs were below  <dig>  . for most proteins, the delay with the best correlation was the same for pc and sc. however, for eight proteins, there were differences of  <dig> minutes. this indicates that linear and non-linear dependencies between transcriptomic and proteomic data play a role. for one protein, a large difference of  <dig> minutes was calculated. this protein was the only one, where sc was below  <dig>  taken together, the following picture appeared: eight proteins responded in the first  <dig> minutes after transcript regulation .  <dig> proteins were  <dig> to  <dig> minutes delayed , and five proteins responded  <dig> minutes after their transcript . proteins related to cell wall/cytoskeleton organization , transport  and signal transduction  all responded with medium delay in respect to their transcript. chaperones showed all different delays. defense proteins against oxidative stress  showed high delay. carbohydrate metabolism  and transcription proteins  responded with few or medium delay, while nitrogen metabolism and translation proteins responded with medium or strong delay.

if a protein was present in more than one spot, median correlation and mutual information of all spots is given. pc = pearson correlation, sc = spearman correlation.

comparison to yeast
in yeast, heat shock is largely governed by the transcription factors hsf <dig>  msn2/ <dig> and hac <dig>  many targets of those have already been elucidated  <cit> . hsf <dig> was very recently found to be upregulated in a. fumigatus under heat shock  <cit> . we looked for putative hsf <dig> binding signatures  <cit>  in the genome of a. fumigatus. by using scanprosite  <cit> ,  <dig> genes with a potential heat shock element  in their promoter region were detected . proteins probably regulated by hsf <dig> include chaperones , enzymes of the oxidative stress response , signal transduction , carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism , protein biosynthesis/translation  and transcription  . by using meme  <cit> , one additional chaperone  and one transport protein  with slightly modified hse motifs were found. transcriptional activation of genes coding for chaperones is well known from yeast and higher organisms, but for some other genes  regulation by hsf <dig> has not been previously elucidated for yeast . for the transcription factors msn2/ <dig> and hac <dig> neither scanprosite nor meme provided useful results, since the binding motifs are very short. in addition to the hsf <dig> binding sites, meme identified a possible binding motif for an ap-2alphaa-like transcription factor in  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially regulated proteins . the ap- <dig> family of transcription factors regulates proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development in animals  <cit> . to date, no ap- <dig> homologues have been detected in any eukaryotic microorganism.

discussion
proteome analysis based on the dige technique was used to explore how protein expression changes over time in response to a temperature shift from 30°c to 48°c. data pre-processing methods  were assessed and applied to improve the outcome of the image analysis.

the imputation and normalization approach used in this study combined previously described methods. although each single method has been described before  <cit> , the combination of them has not been used and validated for proteomics data so far. these methods can in principle be applied to any dige dataset by using the online tool dige analyzer.

grouping of significant differentially regulated proteins resulted in two groups with straight up- or downregulation and two groups that depicted oscillatory behavior. this can be explained by feedback loops in the process of heat shock response. since the absolute value of the second extremum was in both cases lower than the first one, the oscillations are damped and represent regulating oscillations, which are typical for biological systems after perturbation.

heat shock response of a. fumigatus characterized on the protein level
a sudden temperature change from 30°c to 48°c elicited a rapid alteration in protein expression and massive changes were already detectable after  <dig> minutes. the concurrent increase of hsps of the cytoplasm, mitochondria and er supports the general notion that heat shock is characterized by unfolding and disassembly of macromolecular structures, most notably proteins  <cit> . the relative abundance of most of the hsps peaked at  <dig> minutes and only increased slightly thereafter or stayed at the same level. in this respect, the heat shock response of a. fumigatus does not differ significantly from that of yeast and other fungi. a transient increase of hsp transcripts within  <dig> minutes was also reported for s. cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe. for these organisms, the maximum expression of hsp genes was detected at around  <dig> minutes  <cit> . hsp 30/hsp <dig> and hsp  <dig> showed the highest increase in abundance during the heat shock response of a. fumigatus. hsp <dig> is a highly abundant cytosolic chaperone. it is essential for the proper function of a diverse set of key regulators of growth, development and defense and is known to be induced upon heat shock  <cit> . it was also described as an allergenic protein of a. fumigatus  <cit> . the alpha-crystalline-type hsp <dig> protein is highly upregulated in many filamentous fungi upon heat shock  <cit> . it is presumably involved in the import of proteins to the mitochondrion  <cit>  and was shown to be upregulated under oxidative stress conditions in a. fumigatus  <cit> .

additionally, enzymes of the oxidative and nitrosative stress response were induced upon heat shock in a. fumigatus. it is known from yeast, that heat shock enhances oxygen respiration. this results in an increase in the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates  and an activation of the oxidative stress response  <cit> . the data indicate a putative heat shock-dependent upregulation of the thioredoxin peroxidase aspf <dig> and the cytochrome c peroxidase ccp <dig>  an upregulation of enzymes involved in the depletion of reactive nitrogen intermediates  upon heat shock has not been previously described for fungi. at higher temperature, higher amounts of reactive nitrogen intermediates may be endogenously generated, in particular during growth with nitrate as sole nitrogen source. nitrate has to be assimilatory reduced to ammonium, a process during which rni can be produced.

interestingly, many differentially regulated proteins were involved in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. most of these enzymes showed an oscillatory upregulation with a maximum at  <dig> minutes. an increase in the abundance of proteins involved in glycolysis could provide energy needed for the atp-dependent protein refolding by chaperones  <cit> . a heat shock-dependent regulation of the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase and hexokinase was also demonstrated for other fungi  <cit> .

in addition, enzymes of the nadph-generating pentose phosphate pathway were upregulated. they are probably involved in balancing the redox state of a. fumigatus after heat stress by providing reducing equivalents for the reduction of roi or oxidized glutathion or thioredoxin. the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was shown to be implicated in the adaptive response to oxidative stress in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , but also showed a heat shock-dependent regulation in yeast  <cit> . heat shock may also lead to increased fatty acid biosynthesis activity due to membrane lipid damage. the cytosolic atp-citrate lyase and the acetyl coenzyme a synthetase were upregulated after heat shock on the protein level  <cit> . these enzymes can provide acetyl-coa as precursor for the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

nitrogen metabolism was also affected by the temperature shift. heat shock leads to an increased turnover of proteins and hence to a higher rate of amino acid biosynthesis in a. fumigatus. this is reflected by the increased levels of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids. in contrast, amino acid synthesis is repressed in s. cerevisiae after heat shock  <cit> . inconsistent to this regulation, many transcripts of amino acid biosynthesis genes showed a converse regulation in comparison to their corresponding protein in a. fumigatus. this phenomenon can best be explained by post-transcriptional regulation such as phosphorylation or acetylation.

recently, a state space model was used to examine the regulation of heat shock and metabolism genes  <cit> . the study found a negative association of many hsps and their regulated metabolic genes. it was most prominent in the temperature shift from 30°c to 37°c and much weaker at 48°c. at the proteomic level, even this weak negative association cannot be confirmed, since all metabolic proteins showed a similar time course as the hsps.

relation of transcriptome and proteome data
comparison of proteome and transcriptome data was not possible on a genome-wide scale. only  <dig> proteins and respective transcripts were detected as differentially regulated in both datasets. therefore, we analysed the correlation of each pair of transcript and protein separately, instead of looking for global relations. when the proteome data were compared with the transcript data of nierman et al.  <cit> , a low correlation for many transcripts and their corresponding proteins was found. similar observations were made during a genome-wide analysis of the effect of heat shock on an s. cerevisiae mutant strain  <cit> . however, the transcript level of some genes, e.g. hsps, correlated well with the corresponding protein levels. this was particularly true when a time delay between transcription and translation was taken into account. part of this inconsistent regulation of transcripts and proteins is explainable by known regulation mechanisms.  in a wide variety of eukaryotes, many stress conditions including heat stress lead to a repression of translation initiation and an accumulation of translationally repressed mrna in either so-called stress granules or in the nucleus. under these conditions, mrna is stabilized by the inhibition of poly shortening, because deadenylation normally leads to an increased mrna decay  <cit> .  under conditions of heat shock, mrnas of hsp genes are selectively exported from the nucleus for protein biosynthesis, whereas the bulky poly mrna remains in the nucleus  <cit> . however, it cannot be ruled out that the different a. fumigatus strains and media used by us  and nierman et al  caused a difference in gene and protein expression.

for the comparison of proteomic and transcriptomic data, two correlation measures were used. both are qualitative measures. they result in only one value for each transcript and protein pair. in the future, it would also be interesting to use methods which provide quantitative information for the comparison of data from both cellular levels.

putative hsf binding sequences in the promoter region of heat-shock regulated proteins
the target genes of the transcriptional regulator hsf <dig> contain a cis-acting sequence, the heat shock element . using scanprosite,  <dig> hses in promoter regions of  <dig> putative target genes of hsf <dig> were identified in a. fumigatus. using meme,  <dig> additional motifs and  <dig> further putative target genes were identified. they had at most one modification that has not been reported in the literature. all three known hse motifs  were present in the promoter region of heat-shock induced genes. among the putatively hsf-regulated genes , many known hsf-targets were found such as hsps, a thioredoxin peroxidase , enzymes of the pentosephosphate shunt  and glycolysis   <cit> . however, other a. fumigatus genes with an hse-element have so far not been associated with hsf-regulation. in yeast, the cytochrome c peroxidase was shown to be regulated by the msn2/msn4-dependent general stress response  <cit> , but in a. fumigatus its expression is presumably induced by hsf <dig>  the cytochrome c peroxidase degrades roi in mitochondria and is involved in conveying the oxidative stress signal  <cit> .

hsf <dig> may also be a regulator of trna/rrna transcription , translation  and leucine biosynthesis . interestingly, the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase is also a potential target of hsf <dig> in a. fumigatus. it is the first enzyme in the pathway for the biosynthesis of mannitol, which appears to be essential for the protection against various stress conditions including heat as shown in a. niger  <cit> .

the protein nudc is involved in nuclear migration during mitosis and hyphal tip growth in a. nidulans, but also implicated in fungal cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . under heat stress conditions, the transcription of the nudc gene may be under transcriptional control of hsf <dig> to maintain cytokinesis and cell proliferation at higher temperature. interestingly, the nudc orthologue nud- <dig> in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans exhibits chaperone activity  <cit> .

of the aforementioned putatively hsf <dig> regulated genes, mannitol-1-phosphate dh, cytochrome c peroxidase and nudc showed the most typical hsf1-driven rapid upregulation on the transcript level and a corresponding increase of the protein product . interestingly, in the promoter region of the orthologous genes in a. flavus, a. nidulans and a. terreus, an hse-sequence was not detectable. further studies are needed to verify whether this regulation is unique to a. fumigatus and whether it could contribute to the observed thermotolerance in this fungus.

furthermore, the relevance of the ap-2α-like binding motif in the promoter region of some heat-induced genes has to be validated experimentally. homologues of ap- <dig> like transcription factors have not been found in fungal genomes yet.

CONCLUSIONS
in our proteome study, the heat shock response of a. fumigatus was analyzed. for this purpose, a workflow was established that includes missing value imputation, data normalization and filtering of differentially regulated proteins. the workflow is shown in additional file  <dig> . this workflow could be applicable to many dige datasets. therefore, the described tool is publicly available in the internet.

the analysis of the adaptation of a. fumigatus to high temperatures revealed many similarities but also some obvious differences to the heat shock response compared to well-studied, mesophilic fungi such as s. cerevisiae and s. pombe, which are not able to grow at temperatures beyond 40°c.

the heat shock response in a. fumigatus was transient and most changes in protein expression appeared within two hours. afterwards, the level of protein expression continued on a different, often higher level  or dropped to the initial level . besides the well known increased biosynthesis of hsps upon heat stress, several other processes were influenced in a. fumigatus during heat shock: oxidative stress response, signal transduction, transcription, translation, energy generation, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism and cytoskeleton organisation. additionally to the hsf <dig> regulon, other stress regulators are most likely involved in the heat shock response of a. fumigatus.

novel potential hsf <dig> targets were identified. they seem to be a. fumigatus specific and mediate oxidative stress resistance in mitochondria, function as osmoregulator or roi scavenger or are required for nuclear migration.

it is interesting to speculate that some of the putatively hsf1-regulated target proteins described here mediate the high thermotolerance of a. fumigatus.
