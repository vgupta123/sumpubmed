BACKGROUND
triple-negative breast cancer  is a subtype of breast cancer that is lacking the expression ofestrogen receptor , progesterone receptor  and her <dig>  <cit> . tnbc, also known as basal-like breast cancer, is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. unlike er-positive, pr-positive, and her2-amplified breast cancer subtype patients, chemotherapy is the only treatment option for tnbc patients. advances in the treatment of tnbc have been hampered by the lack of novel effective targeted therapies due to the poor understanding of the underlying molecular characteristics of this disease. recent large-scale molecular characterization studies in breast cancer have revealed some frequently mutated genes and altered pathways in tnbc <cit> . these genes and pathways include tp <dig>  brca1/ <dig>  pik3ca, and pten mutations and activation of pi3k/akt and ras/raf/mek signaling pathways. many of these genes and pathways are regulated by kinases ; therefore providing an opportunity to identify potential druggable targets by small moleculesfor tnbc therapy.

protein kinases represent one of the largest “druggable” and well-studied protein families in the human genome <cit> . this class of proteins  plays key role in regulating various signaling pathways in cells. there are> <dig> members of the human kinome which can be classified into seven different kinase families based on their conserved catalytic domain sequences <cit> . in cancer cells, some kinases are mutated and have acquired oncogenic properties to drive tumorgenesis. small molecules that inhibit these oncogenic kinases can effectively kill cancer cells. targeted cancer therapies have exploited this “oncogene addiction” concept <cit> ; this has lead to several successful clinical applications of targeted therapies: bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibition in chronic myeloid leukemia by imatinib <cit> , inhibition of egfr in egfr-mutated non-small cell lung cancers  by erlotinib or gefitinib <cit> , inhibition of braf in braf-mutated melanoma by vemurafenib <cit> and inhibition of alk in eml4-alk nsclc by crizotinib <cit> . furthermore, many of the small molecules inhibit multiple kinases and could be repositioned or repurposedfor other applications. for example, imatinib has been repositioned to inhibit kit and pdgfra in gastrointestinal stromal tumors <cit>  and crizotinib has been repositioned to inhibit ros <dig> in ros1-fusion nsclc patients <cit> . large-scale quantitative in vitro kinase binding assays have been developed to capture the complex interactions between inhibitors and kinases <cit> .

high-throughput screening  provides a different perspective to interrogate biological systems using chemical biology. large-scale hts studies such as cancer cell line encyclopedia  <cit> , genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer  <cit> , cancer therapeutics response portal  <cit> , and nci- <dig> developmental therapeutic program screen <cit> represent examples of the hts pharmacological profiling data sources. one recent study has performed hts of  <dig> kinase inhibitors in  <dig> tnbc cell lines <cit> . typically, hts was performed on a panel of cancer cell lines screened with multiple compounds to generate pharmacological profiling data. from the pharmacological profiling data, one can correlate the compound sensitivity with other molecular genomics data to derive drug sensitivity signatures <cit> . another application of hts pharmacological data is to correlate with in vitro kinase binding assays to deconvolute kinase dependency in biological systems <cit> . however, no efforts have been made to integrate hts pharmacological profiling data, in vitro kinase binding data, and genomics data for dissecting kinase dependency in cancer cells.

the goal of this study was to determine the kinase dependency in tnbc cell lines and to predict compounds that could inhibit these kinases using integrative bioinformatics analysis. in this study, we used publicly available gene expression data, hts pharmacological profiling data, and quantitative in vitro kinase binding data. we employed our recently developed kinase addiction ranker  to integrate these data sourcesto dissect kinase dependency in tnbc cell lines <cit> . we then used the kinase dependency predicted by kar to query k-map  <cit> for connecting compounds with kinases for individual tnbc lines. for validation, we performed literature search on published experimental data and tested k-map predictionsin cell lines. our research strategy for this study is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

methods
pharmacological profiling data
we obtained the hts pharmacological profiling data of  <dig> tnbc cell lines from a recently published paper  <cit> . the  <dig> tnbc cell lines are: bt <dig>  bt <dig>  cal <dig>  hcc <dig>  hcc <dig>  hcc <dig>  hcc <dig>  hcc <dig>  hs578t, mda-mb <dig>  mda-mb <dig> and mfm <dig>  these cell lines were screened with  <dig> kinase inhibitors. the drug sensitivity read out from this dataset is half maximal effective concentration values .

quantitative kinase inhibition data
we obtained comprehensive quantitative kinase inhibition data for  <dig> of the  <dig> screened kinase inhibitors from literature. drug sensitivity data from these  <dig> drugs were used in our algorithm. this comprehensive inhibition data allows for better interpretation of high-throughput screening results as most kinase inhibitors interact with far more kinases than the ones that are most commonly reported <cit> .

microarray gene expression data
we obtained the tnbc microarray gene expression data from the cancer cell line encyclopedia . these cell lines were profiled using affymetrix hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  microarrays. raw cel files for these cell lines were normalized using robust multiarray average  approach in affymetrix power tools .

kinase addiction ranker 
we have recently developed kar , a novel computational method that integrates high-throughput drug screening data, quantitative kinase binding data, and transcriptomics data to define kinase dependency for individual cancer cell lines  <cit> . for each cell line, kar first assigns compounds in the high-throughput drug screen to <dig> of  <dig> bins based on drug sensitivity. the bin number determines how many points each kinase target of the drug receives by the scoring algorithm. targets of compounds in bin  <dig> receive  <dig> points, bin  <dig> targets receive  <dig> points, bin  <dig> targets receive  <dig> points, bin  <dig> targets receive  <dig> points, and bin  <dig> targets receive - <dig> points. bin  <dig> and  <dig> therefore contain drugs that do not meet the threshold for drug sensitivity in the sample, with compounds in bin  <dig> receiving a negative penalty.

next, quantitative kinase binding data is dichotomized as inhibited or not inhibited for each compound based on user-defined threshold . transcriptomics data is used to filter out low expressed kinases. kinases are scored by adding or subtracting points based on the sensitivity bin of each drug that inhibits the kinase. finally, p-values are computed using chi-square and fisher's exact tests to determine if there is a significant association between a kinase being inhibited and the drug being sensitive  in the cell line. kar returns the ranked list of kinases based on p-values and scaled scores. kinases with p <  <dig>  will be deemed as significant and dependent by the cancer cell line. we have implemented kar in two programming languages: python and matlab. kar is freely available at: http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/kar.

kinase connectivity map  analysis
we recently developed and implemented k-map that systematically connects a kinase profile with a reference kinase inhibitor database and predicts the most effective inhibitor for a queried kinase profile  <cit> . the k-map consists of three key components:  a reference database that contains a set of kinase inhibitors profiles;  a query signature; and  a pattern matching algorithm or similarity metric defined between a query signature and a reference kinase inhibitor profile to quantify the connection  between the interactions of kinases and inhibitors.

reference database
the current k-map reference database was builtbased on two recently published comprehensive analyses of kinase inhibitor selectivity  <cit> . the first study systematically interrogated  <dig> commercially available inhibitors against a panel of  <dig> protein kinases using a radiometric phospho-transfer method to assess the percent kinase inhibition  <cit> . the second study measured the selectivity and potency of  <dig> inhibitors against  <dig> kinases using direct binding affinities between inhibitors and kinases  <cit> . these datasets were converted into rank-ordered lists according to the inhibitors' potencies against the kinases and used as the k-map reference profiles for matching query kinases.

query signature
for each tnbc line, the top five kinases ranked by kar were used as the query kinase profile and connected through the k-map in this study.

pattern matching algorithm
k-map implementsthe pattern matching strategy based on the kolmogorov-smirnov  statistics. the ks-test is a non-parametric, rank-based pattern-matching approach implemented in the connectivity map <cit> . the algorithm aims to correlate kinase inhibitors, based on kinase inhibition profiles in the reference database, with a given query . for every inhibitor in the reference database, the ks statistic is computed and a “connectivity score” is defined where it ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . k-map then returnsthe ranked list of kinase inhibitors that best inhibit the list of queried kinases sorted by their “connectivity scores”. we used k-map to connect the top five kinases for  <dig> tnbc cell lines with drugs in this study. k-map is freely available at: http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/kmap.

cell lines and culture
hcc <dig> was obtained from the american type culture collection . the cell line has been authenticated as previously described <cit> . cell cultures were prepared as previously described <cit> .

drugs
erlotinib and bosutinib were obtained commercially  and prepared according to the manufacture's guidelines.

cell proliferation assay
to evaluate the drug effects in tnbc cells, we used the celltiter-glo assay. in brief, cell viability assayswere performed using celltiter-glo  according to manufacturer's instructions. tnbc cells were seeded at  <dig> cells/well in a 96-well plate, and exposed to increasing concentrations of erlotinib or bosutinib from  <dig> -  <dig> μmol/l for  <dig> hours. celltiter-glo measurements were obtained for these different concentrations to determine cell viability. cell viability curves were derived from the data and ic <dig> values calculated from a minimum of three experiments.

RESULTS
kinase addiction ranker for ranking kinase dependency in tnbc cell lines
to identify kinase dependency in tnbc, we first analyzed a hts pharmacological profiling data set of  <dig> kinase inhibitors profiled across  <dig> tnbc cell lines <cit> . we selected  <dig> of the  <dig> profiled drugs based on availability of a published quantitative in vitrokinase inhibition profile and inhibition of at least one kinase above threshold . we used kar , a novel bioinformatics approach, which integrates gene expression, drug sensitivity, and kinase inhibition data to generate a ranked list of kinase dependency in these tnbc cell lines. as described in the methods section, kar integrates three data sources  to delineate kinase dependency in individual cell lines. on average, kar identified  <dig> kinases with a significant association with drug sensitivity in each cell line  .

the kinases most commonly associated with drug sensitivity in the tnbc cell lines were map4k <dig> and prkd <dig>  which were each significant in 10/ <dig> tnbc cell lines. map4k <dig>  activates mapk8/jnk signaling. map4k <dig> is involved in cell migration and invasion in melanoma, ovarian, breast and prostate cancers <cit> . moreover, overexpression of map4k <dig> correlated with larger tumor size, increased lymph node involvement, and recurrence in pancreatic ductal carcinoma <cit> . prkd <dig> has been shown to promote proliferation and chemoresistance in tnbc  <cit> . since map4k <dig> and prkd <dig> are so frequently associated with drug sensitivity in this dataset, they may represent targets that could benefit larger populations of tnbc patients. map4k <dig> and prkd <dig> are simultaneously inhibited by cdk1/ <dig> inhibitor iii and pkr inhibitor, which were sensitive in nearly all of the  <dig> cell lines.

next, we performed hierarchical clustering on the scaled kar scores to reveal relationships between the  <dig> tnbc cell lines and kinases . clustering included the  <dig> kinases that had a significant association with drug sensitivity in at least one of the  <dig> cell lines analyzed. no correlation of tnbc subtypes <cit>  were found in these clusters, this is similar to the previous published pharmacological profiling data. this suggests the heterogeneity of the molecular subtypes of tnbc andthat understanding the kinase dependency could provide better treatment strategy for this disease.

from figure  <dig>  the cluster analysis reveals three main groups of tnbc cell lines . the first group contains hcc <dig>  bt <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  hcc <dig> and bt <dig>  the second group contains hcc <dig>  hcc <dig> and cal <dig> and the third group contains mfm <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  hcc <dig> and hs578t. within the first group, hcc <dig> and bt <dig> show a unique dependence on egfr when compared to the other three lines . interestingly, egfr also does not cluster with any of the other kinases analyzed, indicating egfr dependence is a fairly unique marker in a cell line compared to other kinases.

we also clustered the pharmacological profiling data  from all  <dig> drugs <cit> . as with the kinase score, egfr-dependent bt <dig> and hcc <dig> grouped together. the other cell lines show less distinct groupings with many cell lines being paired with different cell lines than when clustered based on kinase score. this suggests that the kinase dependency relationships derived from kar are different from the relationships derived from clustering pharmacological profiling data.

validating kinase dependency in tnbc cell lines
here, we validate the kinases with high kar rankings  in a subset of the tnbc cell lines studied based on previously published studies.

bt20
kar ranks epidermal growth factor receptor , as the top kinase for this cell line. indeed, previously published papers have verified that this cell line expressed high levels of egfr <cit> , however, this cell line is not sensitive to egfr inhibitors such as erlotinib or gefitinib <cit> . this indicates that there may be some other kinases driving the proliferation of this cell line.

hcc1806
for this cell line, kar ranks yes <dig> and lyn in the top  <dig> kinases. both of these kinases are src kinase family members. indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that this cell line is highly sensitive to dasatinib  <cit> . interestingly, kar also ranks egfr as one of the kinase dependent in this cell line. from the clustering of kinase dependency score , bt <dig> and hcc <dig> clustered together.

hcc70
kar ranks aurora kinase a  as one of the top five kinases in this cell line. previously, we have tested two different aurora kinase inhibitors across a large panel of tnbc cell lines, and found that hcc <dig> is very sensitive to mln <dig>  <cit>  and enmd <dig>  <cit> . this supports aurka dependence in this cell line. in fact, there is an ongoing phase ii clinical trial of treating tnbc patients with enmd <dig> .

mda-mb-231
kar ranks map3k <dig>  which is commonly known as the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase  <dig> , as the top kinase for this cell line. interestingly, this cell line is the only tnbc cell line analyzed that is a kras mutant  and is highly dependent on kras  <cit> . indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that this cell line has high map3k <dig> expression, and is sensitive to the tak <dig> kinase inhibitor 5z-7-oxozeaenol  <cit> . previous studies in colorectal cancer cell lines have suggested that tak <dig> could be a therapeutic target in kras-dependent lines  <cit> . this confirms that kar could identify relevant kinases for individual cell lines.

kar results indicate that the other tnbc cell lines seem highly dependent on mapks  and cdk kinases . a previous study evaluating kinase expression in estrogen receptor  positive vs. negative breast cancer samples identified a subgroup in the er-negative samples also enriched with mapks <cit> .

predicting compounds for individual tnbc cell lines by using k-map
for each tnbc cell lines, we used the top five ranking kinases  as the query to k-map for predicting effective compounds. compounds with p <  <dig>  are selected and sorted by connectivity scores. table  <dig> lists the top five compounds predicted by k-map based on the top five kinases for each tnbc cell lines.

staurosporine, a multi-kinase inhibitor used as the positive control in the k-map, was predicted as an effective compound for ten tnbc cell lines . this is likely because a highly non-specific compound like staurosporine can inhibit >  <dig> kinases by itself.

validating compounds predicted by k-map in tnbc cell lines
from table  <dig> k-map predicts bosutinib as one of the compounds that targets the top five ranking kinases of bt <dig> and hcc <dig>  both cell lines have egfr dependency as determined by kar, and one of the targets of bosutinib is egfr. in addition to egfr, bosutinib also inhibits top ranking kinases yes <dig>  tnk <dig>  map4k <dig>  and lyn . therefore, bosutinib inhibits each top ranking kinase for hcc <dig> while erlotinib only inhibits one of the top five . we would therefore predict that hcc <dig> would be more sensitive to bosutinib than erlotinib. to validate this prediction, we tested hcc <dig> in vitro with bosutinib and erlotinib using a celltiter-glo assay. as depicted in figure  <dig>  the ic <dig> of bosutinib is lower than erlotinib  in hcc <dig>  this validates the k-map prediction that this cell line is more sensitive to bosutinibthan erlotinib. we also validated bt <dig> with bosutinib and erlotinib, and found that bosutinib also exhibited lower ic <dig> than erlotinib. .

k-map predicts su <dig> and sunitinib as potential compounds to be effective against hs578t. both compounds are pdgfr inhibitors, where pdgfrb is the top dependent kinase predicted by kar for this cell line. indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that hs578t has high expression of pdgfrb , and this cell line is more sensitive to sunitinib <cit> .

cdk 1/ <dig> inhibitor was predicted by k-map as one of the compounds that inhibits the top five kinases in nine tnbc cell lines . recent studies have suggested that myc-dependence is synthetic lethal with cdk inhibitor in tnbc cell lines <cit> . indeed, six of these cell lines  were myc-dependent  <cit> . this supports that the k-map prediction of cdk1/ <dig> inhibitor could be a potential therapeutic for these tnbc cell lines.

similar to fink et al.'s analysis of the pharmacological profiling data  <cit> , we observed heterogeneity of kinase dependence among the  <dig> tnbc cell lines and no co-clustering of cell lines of the same molecular subtype. we also showed egfr dependence for bt- <dig> and hcc <dig>  but our experiments showed much lower sensitivity to erlotinibthan fink et al. . fink et al.'s clustering of the drug sensitivity datarevealed co-clustering of hcc <dig>  bt <dig>  and mda-md <dig>  and reported increased sensitivity of this group to pi3k pathway inhibitors <cit> . here, kar revealed significant association between pik3cb inhibition and drug sensitivity in hcc <dig> and bt <dig>  but much higher correlations with drug sensitivity for other kinases . fink et al. also report that another group of cell lines which co-cluster , are generally resistant to kinase inhibition with no kinase target being selectively toxic to this group  <cit> . our approach incorporating more comprehensive target lists for each drug, however, was able to find kinases with significant associations with drug sensitivity for each cell line in this group. moreover, mapk4k <dig>  which was one of the kinases most commonly associated with drug sensitivity in the  <dig> tnbc cell lines, is significant in all but hcc1187in this group of cell lines.

here, we presented examples of how the kar algorithm and k-map research tool can be integrated to determine kinase dependency and predict effective cancer drugs for tnbc. kar aids greatly in preventing misinterpretation of hts data, as kinase inhibitors typically inhibit many more targets than are commonly reported. kar therefore helps uncover kinase dependency that may be overlooked if only focusing on the commonly reported drug targets. moreover, incorporation of gene expression data can help ensure that high-ranking kinases will be translationally applicable. compared to previous approaches <cit> , kar benefits from producing scores and p-values that can be easily interpreted by biologists without computational backgrounds, incorporation of transcriptomics data, increased accessibility , and does not require preliminary optimization of the drug screening list. k-map allows for quick connection of essential kinases revealed by kar to compounds for experimental testing. k-map can help reveal drugs that may not have been part of the original screening set. while we used this approach with tnbc cell lines, a similar strategy can be used with patient samples to predict effective kinase inhibitor therapies and drug combinations.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented an integrative bioinformatics analysis to determine kinase dependency in tnbc. we integrated three different high-throughput data sources with the kar algorithm: hts pharmacological profiling data, quantitative in vitro kinase binding data, and gene expression data. we then queried the top five kinases from each tnbc cell lines to k-map to predict compounds that could inhibit these sets of kinases. we validated the kar and k-map predictions using experiments and published studies. using the integrative bioinformatics analysis, we have discovered kinase dependency in these tnbc cell lines. the data provide candidate kinases and drugs for further pharmacological and biological studies.
