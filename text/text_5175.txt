BACKGROUND
the genera aspergillus and penicillium contain some of the most beneficial as well as the most harmful fungal species. they include many industrial producers of important antibiotics, enzymes and pharmaceuticals, which have brought about a massive transformational impact on human health  <cit> . several other species are extensively used in production of foods or other useful compounds. pathogenic fungi, on the other hand, can significantly affect livestock and crops, both as agents of infection and by means of contamination with mycotoxins, and they commonly cause allergic and occasionally life-threatening infections in humans  <cit> . fungal infections in humans are notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat, especially in immunocompromised patients. to achieve a better understanding of their biology, nuclear genomes of several aspergillus and penicillium species have been sequenced, yet only a handful of mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced and annotated.

with a few notable exceptions such as podospora anserina <cit> , chaetomium thermophilum <cit> , and rhizoctonia solani , fungal mitochondrial genomes are small, with an average size of  <dig>  bp . for a fraction of the cost required to sequence a nuclear genome, mitochondrial genomic sequences may provide vital clues into the evolution, population genetics, and biology of these fungi. aside from energy metabolism, mutations in mitochondrial genes have been linked to cellular differentiation, cell death and senescence pathways, as well as drug resistance and hypovirulence  <cit> . the widespread uniparental inheritance and high copy number of these organelles make them promising markers for cost-effective species identification and for studying fungal population structure  <cit> . mitochondrial dna can be a rich source of novel genotyping markers due to the presence of highly mobile introns in many fungal mitochondria  <cit> . finally, fungal mitochondria may serve as valuable experimental models for studies of human heart and muscle diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> . mitochondrial biology is gaining notice with the advent of so called “three parent in vitro fertilization” as a means of producing disease free children from a mother with an inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  <cit> . in aspergillus fumigatus the advent of the ability to perform sexual crosses will potentially allow for the genetic analysis of mitochondrial mutations and their phenotypes.

despite their importance, only a few complete aspergillus and penicillium mitochondrial genomes have been reported  <cit> . in a. fumigatus, the ratio of mitochondrial to nuclear genomes is 12: <dig>  based on optical mapping  <cit> . although mitochondrial sequence reads are generated in every eukaryotic genome sequencing project, most studies only report nuclear genomes. as a result, little is known about the mitochondrial genome organization in many important fungi, such as the human pathogen a. fumigatus and the penicillin producer p. chrysogenum, which impedes their functional studies. here we report the complete sequence and annotation of mitochondrial genomes of six aspergillus and three penicillium species. the accompanying comparative analysis of these and related publicly available genomes provides insight into mitochondrial genome organization, distribution of group i introns and plasmid-encoded genes, and phylogenetic relationships among these fungi.

mitochondrial genome size variation and sources of genome expansion
the sequenced aspergillus and penicillium mitochondrial genomes showed remarkable variation in size, ranging from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp . the differences in length can be primarily attributed to the number and length of the introns present in the genomes. for example, protein coding genes in the two smallest genomes, a. terreus and p. chrysogenum, do not contain introns, whereas the larger genomes contain one or more introns within orfs. in contrast, the largest mitochondrial genome, t. stipitatus, contains a total of  <dig> introns. the presence and number of accessory genes also contribute to the larger size of some of the mitochondrial genomes. repeat content within the analyzed species was determined to be insignificant . comparison of nuclear genome sizes shows no correlation with the mitochondrial dna sizes .


comparative analysis of  <dig> a. fumigatus strains showed little intraspecies variation in their mitochondrial dna . to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  and deletion insertion polymorphisms , illumina reads of  <dig> a. fumigatus strains, generated in the course of a genome sequencing study , were aligned against the af <dig> mitochondrial dna. the analysis showed few snps and no significant dips. in total, we identified  <dig> candidate snps. the number of snps in individual strains varied from zero  to nine . six snps were located in intergenic regions, and nine were located in coding regions including eight non-synonymous snps. five of these eight non-synonymous snps were found in cob, cox <dig>  nad <dig>  and nad <dig> genes.

a  <dig>  kb deletion was detected in strain a <dig>  compared to strains af <dig>  and af <dig> . the deletion in a <dig> was confirmed by pcr using primers flanking the missing region. in af <dig> and af <dig>  the region contains an 843-bp open reading frame , which is missing in a <dig>  a putative homolog of this hypothetical protein  is present in the closely-related n. fischeri mitochondrial genome, suggesting a recent gene loss in a. fumigatus a <dig> 

likewise, only minor differences were found between mitochondrial genomes of a. oryzae and a. flavus as well as between two strains of p. marneffei . the p. marneffei genomes are  <dig> % identical and their sizes differ only by  <dig> bp . the genomes of a. flavus and a. oryzae differ in size by  <dig> bp and are also  <dig> % identical. it should be noted that some of the strains analyzed were genetically modified during strain development. for example, the p. chrysogenum strain was developed as a result of an extensive strain improvement programs, which may have affected its mitochondrial dna as well  <cit> .

our results are consistent with previous studies of mitochondrial intraspecies polymorphism. with a few exceptions, most pezizomycotina mitochondrial genomes show little variation. by contrast, aspergillus japonicus, p. anserina, neurospora crassa and some other fungi exhibit significant mitochondrial intraspecies polymorphism and genome size variation, which has been attributed to mobile introns  <cit> . thus, population surveys based on rflp have demonstrated the presence of different mitochondrial haplotypes in wild-type subpopulations of p. anserina <cit> .

core mitochondrial genes
all sequenced aspergillus and penicillium mitochondrial genomes contain  <dig> core genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, atp synthesis and mitochondrial protein synthesis, all present on the forward strand . in addition, these genomes carry a complete set of trnas, the small and large subunits of ribosomal rna, and the mitochondrial ribosomal protein s <dig>  additional file  <dig> depicts the protein-coding genes and non-coding rnas in the reference mitochondrial genome of a. fumigatus af <dig>  the core genes share a high level of sequence conservation  and synteny. figure  <dig> shows the conservation of gene order of the core genes in all the aspergillus and most of the penicillium mitochondrial genomes annotated in this study. the exception is the atp <dig> gene, which is located between nad <dig> and cob in p. marneffei atcc 18224). in all the other genomes, atp <dig> lies between cox <dig> and nad <dig>  the number of trna genes varies from  <dig> to  <dig> with no particular correlation between the number and mitochondrial or nuclear genome size .


to explore the possibility that the core genes can provide new insights into aspergillus evolution, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> concatenated core proteins encoded by  <dig> aspergillus and penicillium mitochondrial genomes . the obtained phylogenetic tree clusters the a. nidulans and a. niger nodes together with a bootstrap support of 83%. notably, a. terreus and a. oryzae form another group with bootstrap support of 80%. the tree topology also indicates that p. chrysogenum is not closely related to p. marneffei and t. stipitatus. this finding is consistent with morphological observations  <cit> . the topology of the maximum parsimony based tree is consistent with that of the maximum-likelihood tree .


we have also examined individual mitochondrial genes  and rdna internal-transcribed spacers , which have been proposed as markers for species identification and classification to complement common nuclear dna markers  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis based on these individual protein coding and non-coding genes did not yield phylogenies with >75% bootstrap support for any of the trees  and/or did not have enough power to resolve the relationships between the species. the single-gene trees show incompatible topologies with each other and with the topology obtained from the  <dig> concatenated proteins . this confirms that individual mitochondrial genes are not suitable for species identification in aspergillus species. as shown previously  <cit> , the presence of introns makes cox <dig> and other mitochondrial genes poor candidates for building fungal phylogenies, although cox <dig> is often used in animal phylogenetic studies.

in contrast, our results suggest that the concatenated core mitochondrial proteins can be of value for species level phylogeny construction. interestingly, the concatenated tree topology is identical to the topology obtained previously from over  <dig> concatenated nuclear proteins with identical number of introns among orthologs  <cit> . the a. terreus and a. oryzae grouping is also supported by previously published studies based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis of both nuclear ribosomal and protein-coding genes  <cit>  and concatenated nuclear protein-coding genes  <cit> . however, the a. terreus and a. oryzae nodes form two separate groups in phylogenies based on only nuclear ribosomal genes  <cit> . our analysis highlights the challenges still facing the aspergillus systematics including the unresolved aspergillus tree backbone.

accessory mitochondrial genes
in addition to the core set, most mitochondrial genomes contain accessory genes. the most compact genome , contains only the core set of mitochondrial genes, while other genomes contain at least one accessory gene. some accessory genes are shared by a subset of closely related mitochondrial genomes, but do not show sequence similarity to other genes in public databases. these genes have been annotated as ‘hypothetical’. notably, a. fumigatus strains af <dig> and a <dig> contain  <dig> hypothetical genes each with > 99% identity.

in contrast, two accessory genes, a. clavatus acla_m <dig> and n. fischeri nfia_m <dig>  share similarity with mitochondrial dna and rna polymerase genes from distantly related fungi. they are also the only two protein-coding genes on the reverse strand, and are located between cob and nad <dig> in their respective genomes. acla_m <dig> has a potential frame shift and thus appears to be a pseudogene. homologous dna polymerase sequences are found within the main mitochondrial genome  or on linear mitochondrial plasmids . nfia_m <dig> is present as a c-terminal fragment  and is most similar to the rna polymerase genes found on linear plasmids in blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei  and c. purpurea .

the similarity to mitochondrial plasmid-encoded genes suggests that both a. clavatus and n. fischeri polymerase genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer followed by integration of ancestral mitochondrial plasmids into mitochondrial dna. indeed, linear fungal mitochondrial plasmids typically encode dna and rna polymerases, while circular plasmids have a single gene for a dna polymerase and a reverse transcriptase  <cit> . in several studies, plasmids integrated into mitochondrial dna have been implicated in the mechanism underlying mycelial senescence in fungi  <cit> .

another set of accessory genes annotated in aspergillus and penicillium species encodes putative homing endonucleases. although these genes  can be found within introns and intergenic regions, in this study all hegs were associated with “homing” group i introns . based on sequence conservation, all hegs were assigned to either laglidadg or giy-yig families. the association between hegs and introns is found in many other species. homing introns are considered highly mobile, invasive genetic elements common in fungi and plants, but they can be also found in some animals and prokaryotes. they propagate via the double-strand-break-repair pathway into the specific target sequence , which is recognized and cleaved by the endonuclease  <cit> . some endonucleases can also function as maturases by facilitating self-splicing of introns  <cit> . hegs themselves are considered mobile and are typically bounded by two halves of the homing site . hegs are considered selfish elements, but may also contribute to mitochondrial dna integrity  <cit> . the variability of hegs in aspergillus and penicillium species can be exploited to develop phylogenetic markers that might be useful for differentiation of various species. variants of hegs are now being engineered for targeted cleavage of genomic sequences with potential applications in biotechnology, medicine and agriculture  <cit> .

diversity, evolution and origin of mitochondrial group i intron insertions
most fungal mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date contain one or more group i or group ii introns. in the pezizomycotina subphylum , the largest number of mitochondrial introns, a total of  <dig>  have been documented for p. anserina <cit> , while mycosphaerella graminicola is currently the only species identified that lacks mitochondrial introns entirely  <cit> .

the aspergillus and penicillium species sequenced here also have variable intron distribution. similar to previous observations the number and insertion sites of these introns vary, even between closely related species, suggesting cyclical intron gain and loss through horizontal transfer. our analysis shows that the variation in intron number is the primary source of difference in genome size . thus, the t. stipitatus genome contains eleven introns, while a. terreus and p. chrysogenum genomes both contain only a single intron.

the mitochondrial dna sequences analyzed here contain group i introns distributed between three protein coding genes and the large subunit ribosomal rna  . as observed in a variety of mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , the cox <dig> gene contains the most variable number of introns. for the aspergillus species, a. nidulans has three cox <dig> introns, a. clavatus and n. fischeri each have two, and a. fumigatus, a. flavus and a. oryzae contain a single intron. a. terreus is the only aspergillus species in this study that does not contain an intron in the cox <dig> gene. the cox <dig> intron insertions sites also vary between the aspergillus species. the cox <dig> intron insertion site in the a. fumigatus species is seen in the closely related n. fischeri genome and in the more distantly related p. marneffei and t. stipitatus genomes. the cox <dig> insertion site in a. flavus and a. oryzae is also present in a. clavatus.

for the penicillium species, p. marneffei and t. stipitatus contain seven and eight cox <dig> introns, respectively, while p. chrysogenum does not contain any cox <dig> introns. between p. marneffei and t. stipitatus, six of the intron insertion sites are identical. all of the cox <dig> intron insertions sites have been previously observed in other distantly related fungi such as saccharomyces cerevisiae, p. anserina and n. crassa <cit> .

the other two protein coding genes that contain group i introns are the cob and nad <dig> genes. a. nidulans and a. clavatus contain a common cob intron, while p. marneffei contains a single intron and t. stipitatus contains two cob introns. these two penicillium species are also the only two in this study with an intron in the nad <dig> gene. the cox <dig>  cob, and nad <dig> introns in all the species encode either a laglidadg or giy-yig homing endonuclease .

by contrast, the one intron common to all the mitochondrial genomes described here is found at a single location in the lsu rrna gene. these introns are closely related in secondary structure  with the only major difference between the genera being an additional stem-loop structure  present in all the aspergillus introns , but absent in the penicillium species. all pezizomycotina mitochondria sequenced to date, with the exception of the diothideomycetes , contain a mitochondrial lsu rrna intron inserted at this position. intron insertions are also commonly found in the mitochondrial lsu gene in plants and other fungi.


our results are consistent with two previously observed characteristics of pezizomycotina mitochondrial lsu introns. first, these introns do not contain endonuclease orfs, but do contain the mitochondrial ribosomal protein s <dig> orf within the p <dig> stem-loop of the intron. in s. cerevisiae and other fungi, mitochondrial s <dig> is nuclear encoded and transported into the mitochondrial matrix  <cit>  but is not encoded in the nuclear genome of any pezizomycotina fungi sequenced to date. no studies have thoroughly examined the function of the mitochondrial s <dig> orf, but decreased expression of mitochondrial s <dig> from the intron orf in n. crassa leads to mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit assembly defects and decreased mitochondrial protein expression  <cit> . second, though group i introns are normally considered self-splicing, the pezizomycotina mitochondrial lsu introns tested to date cannot self-splice  <cit> . these introns require a mitochondrial tyrosyl-trna synthetase  as a structure-stabilizing splicing cofactor found only in pezizomycotina  <cit> .

the intron distribution in the genera described here suggests two distinct mechanisms of intron evolution within the lineage. the presence of homing endonucleases in all of the cox <dig>  cob <dig>  and nad <dig> introns suggests they likely follow the previously proposed “omega” cycle of intron gain and loss  <cit> . in this model, horizontal transmission into an intronless site is promoted by a functional homing endonuclease, followed by endonuclease degradation, and eventually, intron loss. the cycle can then be restarted by a new horizontal transmission event. the sporadic distribution of introns in the protein coding genes analyzed here indicates that horizontal gene transfer may be quite common in the aspergillus and penicillium mitochondrial genomes. it also highlights the challenges associated with using cox <dig> and other mitochondrial genes to build species phylogenies.

the mitochondrial lsu intron likely follows a slightly different evolutionary trajectory. the widespread distribution of mitochondrial lsu introns in pezizomycotina that contain the s <dig> orf suggests that this intron insertion event occurred after the divergence from the yeasts, and became fixed within the lineages. fixation was likely due to the selective advantage from the s <dig> gene, but also from accumulated mutations in the intron, which resulted in its dependence on the nuclear encoded mitochondrial tyrrs splicing factor. this idea is supported by the observation that the dithideomycetes, the only pezizomycotina group that lacks mitochondrial lsu introns, contain degraded adaptations of the mitochondrial tyrrs splicing factor necessary for intron splicing  <cit> . a plausible scenario is that this degeneration occurred after mitochondrial lsu intron loss. it remains unclear how the dithideomycetes have compensated for the loss of the s <dig> protein  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the complete sequence and annotation of mitochondrial genomes of six aspergillus and three penicillium species, which represent the two most significant genera among filamentous fungi. the study expands the genomic resources available to fungal biologists by providing mitochondrial genomes with consistent annotations. the accompanying comparative analysis of these and related publicly available genomes provides insight into genome organization and phylogenetic relationships among these organisms. by clustering together a. terreus and a. oryzae, the phylogenetic tree based on  <dig> concatenated core mitochondrial proteins has a different topology from some previously published single protein trees, but is similar to trees built using multiple nuclear proteins. this suggests that core genes in mitochondrial and nuclear genomes co-evolved in the aspergillus lineage.

despite the conservation of the core genes, mitochondrial genomes of aspergillus and penicillium species exhibit significant amount of interspecies variation consistent with experimental evidence for intraspecies horizontal transfer and recombination in mitochondrial dna  <cit> . most of this variation can be attributed to accessory genes and mobile introns, presumably acquired via swapping and integration of mitochondrial plasmid and intron homing followed by gene or intron loss. annotated core and accessory genes can serve as complementary markers in future population genetics and evolution studies.
