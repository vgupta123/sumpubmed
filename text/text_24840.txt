BACKGROUND
large-scale characterization of mrna populations has been approached through the generation of expressed sequence tags , where single-pass sequencing reads are derived from cdna clones  <cit> . this approach has proven to be extremely flexible in providing rapid identification of gene sequences, novel and alternatively spliced genes and for the annotation of genomic sequences  <cit> . currently, over  <dig> million ests have been deposited into the public repository for expressed sequences, dbest  <cit> . a drawback of this approach is the cost of generating sequencing reads, which, although continuing to decline, has dictated the ability for deep expression profiling of a given sample or tissue. currently, the largest number of ests from a single tissue is  <dig> , derived from pancreatic islet cells, and the median number for human est datasets is  <dig>  if a eukaryotic cell is estimated to contain approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> mrna molecules  <cit> , then it is clear that deep sampling and quantization of specific mrna populations is yet to be achieved through traditional est sequencing. high sequencing costs combined with high sequence redundancy rates has led to normalization of cdna libraries, though significantly improving the ability to derive novel transcript sequences, eliminates the utility of the est data for any quantitative assessment of transcript abundance  <cit> .

to address the use of mrna sequencing to quantitatively assess transcript abundance the serial analysis of gene expression  methodology was developed  <cit> . this approach provided restriction enzyme defined tags, initially fourteen base pairs in length, to be extracted from cdna molecules. these are concatenated and subjected to single-pass sequencing, allowing a number of transcripts, typically 20– <dig>  <cit> , to be identified in a single sequencing read. however, a few disadvantages remain with the technique: a number of transcripts lack the appropriate anchoring restriction tags to generate a sage tag and due to the relatively short sequences generated, usually 5–15% of tags will not map unambiguously to any gene locus  <cit> . as the sage tag is also expected to be derived from the 3' most anchoring restriction site, the ability of this technique to investigate transcript structure and splice variants is limited.

we report here on the application of a massively parallel sequencing approach utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis  <cit>  as an efficient approach to generate ests. on genomic dna, this approach has been shown to generate over  <dig>  dna sequences in a single machine run with an average read length of  <dig> base pairs  <cit> , which is significantly shorter than those typically generated through sanger-based capillary array electrophoresis sequencing. using sequencing-by-synthesis random shotgun sequencing we hypothesize that these approaches will provide not only a quantitative measure of transcript abundance but also a survey of splice-variants within an mrna population. as this approach does not require the cloning of the cdna, it will also not be influenced by biases introduced by bacterial host-associated cloning bias.

we have chosen to perform experiments on the lncap human prostate cancer cell line  <cit>  stimulated with synthetic androgen because it represents a well studied experimental resource and is a significant model for the study of prostate cancer.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  ests were obtained which passed the default quality thresholds as determined by the manufacturer . a summary of the analysis of the ests is presented in table  <dig>  initially, low quality bases were trimmed from the est ends using trim <dig>  <cit>  and the resulting sequences, with an average, minimum and maximum length of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp, respectively, were compared to the known and predicted human transcriptome  <cit> .  <dig>   sequences matched directly by blast  <cit>  to a specific human transcript with a p-value less than  <dig> × 10- <dig>  while  <dig>   of the sequences did not match with any known human transcribed sequence and hence potentially identify novel transcripts at this relatively high stringency. the  <dig>  ests mapping to a known transcript cover  <dig>  mb of the annotated human transcriptome and are available through dbest  <cit> .

an histogram of the abundance of transcripts from annotated gene loci is shown in figure  <dig>  the ten most abundant transcripts are shown in table  <dig>  further, we collected all genes detected in our library which are described by ensembl as either being involved in cancer or expressed in the prostate and have made these available as a supplementary table . of the  <dig>  loci for which transcription was detected   <dig>  were observed with a single est sequence. lowering the blast p-value to  <dig>  allows  <dig>  ests to map to  <dig>  loci of which  <dig>  have only one est mapped to them .

in order to determine whether our technique quantitatively measures transcript abundance, we compared our est library to two sage libraries of r <dig> treated lncap cells  <cit> . these two combined libraries have approximately  <dig>  unique tags that we mapped unambiguously to  <dig>  genes using discoveryspace  <cit> .

calculating the pearson coefficient for all  <dig>  genes gives a correlation value of  <dig> . this value increases to  <dig>  if we only consider genes that had at least one sage tag. of our  <dig> most abundant genes,  <dig>  are represented in the top  <dig> most abundant genes in the sage library. by reducing our stringency on which tags are deemed ambiguous we can successfully map an additional  <dig> genes of our top ten genes to the top  <dig> most abundant genes in the sage library.

we studied the representation of the ests across known spliced transcripts . from this experiment, we observe four types of sequencing bias. the first favours the positive strand  of the transcript. the second bias is seen at the 5' and 3' ends of the transcript. this occurs because the ends of a given transcript are readily available for sequencing, even if fragmentation of the cdna is incomplete during the sample preparation . the increased representation of sequences in the mid-range of the transcript arises, almost entirely, to transcripts having lengths shorter than  <dig>  bp. we found that such transcripts generally shear near the centre of the sequence . lastly, there is a general bias to the 3' end of the transcript that is likely due to incomplete cdna synthesis across the entire length of the rna transcript.

we investigated the ability of this approach to identify alternatively spliced transcripts within the mrna population. by using blat  <cit>  to map reads which showed good alignment to the transcriptome, but poor alignment at either end of the read, we discovered  <dig>  previously unreported splice junctions that begin and end in a previously annotated exon and  <dig> novel alternative splice variants that map from a known exon and splice into intronic sequence. for all alternate splices, save  <dig>  the event was demonstrated by a single est. figure  <dig> shows an alternative splicing event within the gene coding for brain protein i <dig>  that causes a  <dig> base pair insertion between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  this frame-shift occurs upstream of the transmembrane regions of the protein, as predicted by ensembl  <cit> , and although it does not cause a premature stop in the coding sequence, it eliminates the transmembrane domains of the protein as determined by interproscan  <cit> . interestingly, disruption of bri <dig> has been implicated in tumor necrosis factor alpha  induced apoptosis resistance  <cit> .

in areas where the base quality, as determined by the  <dig> sequencer, was exceptionally high, we utilized the est data to detect high quality discrepancies  in the lncap transcriptome. in this analysis, we required that discrepancies have a phred-like score > <dig> in order to be considered significant. this score threshold is set a such a level that we would require, at minimum,  <dig> sequences to confirm the presence of a hqd. using this stringent approach we discovered  <dig>  hqds of which  <dig>  were present in ensembl's variations database  <cit> ,  <dig> showed variations at the same position but to a different base, and  <dig>  were not described in ensembl. for each hqd type, the mean and median base quality score were calculated . the mean and median scores for confirmable hqds are significantly higher  than for unconfirmable hdqs . although we do not dismiss all of the unconfirmable  <dig>  hqds as spurious, even under such an hypothesis, a significant  enrichment of characterized variations is found, as compared to random sampling.

we also used the ests for the discovery of unannontated genes. of the  <dig>  ests that did not map to the known human transcriptome at high stringency,  <dig>   were successfully mapped to the entire human genome sequence at high confidence . of these,  <dig>   map mostly or entirely to an intron. the remaining  <dig>  ests map intergenically, that is, to a region that is not known or predicted to contain an orf. further,  <dig>   of these ests map to a region where there is no existing alignment feature in ensembl  and  <dig>  align at least  <dig> kbp away from a known gene.

of the  <dig>  reads,  <dig>  failed to map to the human genome at p ≤  <dig> × 10- <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the distribution of ests that fail to map successfully to the human genome or transcriptome at various p-value thresholds. at p ≤  <dig> ,  <dig>  reads remain unmapped.

the  <dig>  ests that failed to map to the human genome were then aligned to sequences in genbank-nt .  <dig>  failed to map with a p-value ≤  <dig> ,  <dig> reads mapped most strongly to human sequences and  <dig> reads were mapped to other organisms . the  <dig> human sequences that failed to map to the human genome/transcriptome were missed for  <dig> reasons. first, because of the different nucleotide frequencies in the two databases, ests that have low complexity, and therefore high p-values, when mapped to the human genome  have lower p-values when mapped to genbank-nt. second, the genbank-nt database contained ests with splicing patterns not represented in the current ensembl transcript annotation. therefore, the ests that map to exon-exon junctions in these speculated genes will also have poor p-values. the  <dig> reads which were mapped to other organisms are a product of contamination of the sample. although the contamination could have occurred before cdna production, the nature of the contaminants suggests that this most likely occurred in the  <dig> nebulization process. the  <dig>  remaining ests are almost certainly the product of poor quality sequencing. although their quality values are not significantly different from the other reads, they are markedly shorter  which reduces the minimum possible p-value for these sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
the data reported here show that massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis methods can be used to successfully survey a transcriptome. of the top  <dig> most abundant transcripts,  <dig> are involved with energy production and are located on the mitochondrial genome . the over representation of metabolic genes may be indicative of the high energy requirements of the cancerous cell. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel splicing events listed in table  <dig> also occur in genes directly involved with mitochondria and/or energy production, whereas  <dig> others are involved in translation or transcription and may have multiple effects on the cell. further, we were able to identify the expression of over  <dig>  different genes . of these genes, approximately one-third are detected by only one or two ests , showing a low level of redundancy in the library and indicating that further sequence sampling likely would determine the transcription of significantly more gene loci.

this compares favourably to affymetrix microarray experiments done with lncap, which typically find between two and eight thousand genes ;  <cit> ; january 16th, 2006). a specific study of lncap cell expression was carried out by oudes et al.  <cit>  using both the affymetrix profiling platform  <cit>  and massively parallel signature sequencing   <cit> . in this analysis,  <dig>  genes were identified as being expressed using the affymetrix technology  and  <dig>  using mpss. in total, oudes et al. identified  <dig>  genes expressed in lncap. our approach compares favourably to mpss, finding  <dig> % more genes. although we find  <dig> fewer genes than the affymetrix approach at high stringency, using a lower blast alignment stringency , we discover  <dig> more genes than by the microarray-based approach.

we were able to identify  <dig> novel alternative exon splicing events from  <dig> mb of data in a stringent, high-throughput manner. we also discovered over four thousand ests that are entirely or partially intronic. these may originate from unprocessed mrna or may represent novel or extended exons. although it is not possible to fully determine the exact sequence of any of these interesting transcripts from  <dig> reads, this technique does identify transcripts which could be pcr-amplified and sequenced in their entirety.

of the ~ <dig>  detected genes  <dig> are directly described as being involved with cancer or the prostate. the most highly expressed prostate cancer gene is prostate specific androgen  and the most highly expressed cancer specific gene is mindin. both genes have been previously identified as strong prostate cancer markers  <cit>  and both are in the top  <dig> most abundant genes in our est library . this would seem to indicate that our approach is capable of identifying genes important to prostate cancer pathology.

with respect to using  <dig> sequencing to measure transcript abundance, our results correlate modestly to those of sage, having pearson coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig> . however, these values are not significantly lower than correlations between long and short sage or sage and affymetrix chips which generally lie between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the reason for our low correlation coefficients is likely due to a combination of factors. most notably is that the long reads produced by  <dig> allow more tags to be mapped unambiguously to a gene as compared to sage where the short ests are much more likely to align to multiple loci. further, the number of tags produced for a given transcript by  <dig> will depend on transcript length and shearing efficiency as well as transcript abundance. these latter factors make compensating for biases in transcript abundance difficult.

from the approximately  <dig>  base pairs of est sequence with a total phred-like score >  <dig>  as assessed by the  <dig> base calling software, we determined approximately  <dig>  high-quality discrepancies with respect to the human reference sequence . this represents approximately one polymorphism per  <dig> base pairs. this rate is approximately 3– <dig> times higher than would be expected from the sequencing of dna from a normal human diploid source  <cit> . this increased rate of polymorphism can possibly be attributed to the genomic instability and loss of dna repair mechanisms that would have contributed to the original malignancy  <cit>  as well as the number of passages the cell-line would have undergone since the original isolation in  <dig>  and during which additional mutations would have accrued  <cit> .

lastly, we were able to map  <dig>  ests to regions in the human genome where there are neither genes nor other alignment features, such as ests . this is consistent with studies using the affymetrix technology which determined that 49% of transcribed bases determined on human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> fell outside regions containing a gene annotation  <cit> .

this analysis also revealed the bias that occurs when sequencing short sequences of dna by  <dig> sequencing . due to poor or inconsistent nebulization of the cdna sample, sequencing occurs more frequently at the 3' and 5' ends than at the middle of the dna strand, and this gives uneven profiling of the underlying transcriptome. the 3' bias is compounded by incomplete  cdna synthesis, which is known to bias the 3' ends of transcripts. lastly, there is a bias to the coding strand of the transcript and the exact mechanism underlying this observation remains unclear. fortunately, however, this last form of bias has little effect on the possibility of observing alternate splicing events or hdqs in a transcript. the former biases can likely be overcome by using an alternate method of fragmenting the cdna such as random-hexamer primed pcr or possibly nebulizing to a smaller fragment size. we also discovered a minor difficulty with contaminating dna in the sample preparation . this highlights the sensitivity of  <dig> sequencing as well as the need to keep sample preparation clean and to be stringent when aligning sequence data to a target organism.

much of the complexity in our analysis was due to the propensity of  <dig> sequencing to insert or delete bases in homopolymeric nucleotide runs  <cit> . this caused excessive penalties for gapping and other difficulties in the alignments when using a traditional alignment tool such as blast. alternatively, blat tended to over-insert large gaps in the alignments because it suspected every insertion or deletion in the sequence to potentially be the start of an intron. further use of this technology for transcriptional profiling would require the development of a tool, similar to blat, which does not greatly penalize gaps that begin in a homopolymeric region of the sequence and as a consequence, provides better prediction of intron-exon boundaries.

this work has shown that high-throughput sequencing using the  <dig> sequencing-by-synthesis approach is able to profile transcript abundance, and to discover nucleotide discrepancies and novel transcript splicing events.
