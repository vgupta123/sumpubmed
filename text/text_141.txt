BACKGROUND
rett syndrome  is a disorder caused by mutations in methyl cpg binding protein  <dig> , forkhead box g <dig>  or cyclin-dependent kinase-like  <dig>  genes  although the phenotype of patients with mutations in mecp <dig> differs from the phenotype of patients with foxg <dig> or cdkl <dig> mutations, there are some similarities in the clinical profile that overlap with rtt. classic rtt patients with mecp <dig> mutations have a normal period of development followed by regression of acquired skills, deceleration of head circumference, epilepsy, hand stereotypies, breathing abnormalities, inability to walk or talk and intellectual disability while patients with atypical rtt may show some but not all features of classic rett syndrome  <cit> . mutations in foxg <dig> are known to cause the congenital variant of rett syndrome where the initial normal developmental window is absent  <cit> . cdkl <dig> mutations are found in patients with severe epilepsy during early childhood that later show features that resemble atypical rtt syndrome  <cit> .

mecp <dig> is an x-linked methyl cpg binding protein which binds methylated and unmethylated dna  and functions as a repressor and activator of genes . even though mecp <dig> is expressed ubiquitously  <cit> , mecp <dig> mutations and copy number variations in humans lead to neurological phenotypes such as classic or atypical rett syndrome and in rare cases angelman syndrome, x-linked mental retardation and autism  suggesting a distinct role for mecp <dig> protein in the brain  <cit> . the level of mecp <dig> protein in neurons increases with neuronal maturity  <cit>  and it is abundantly expressed in the mature brain, almost equivalent to histone h <dig> levels  <cit> , but the level of mecp <dig> mrna in cells is reported to not correlate with the level of mecp <dig> protein in cells  <cit> .

foxg <dig> protein is a brain specific member of the forkhead transcription factor family with a role in transcriptional repression. similar to other members of the forkhead family, foxg <dig> has a defined binding sequence motif  <cit> , which bears sequence similarity to other forkhead protein binding sites.

cdkl <dig> protein is a serine threonine kinase, whose expression is low in embryonic stages, but increases in postnatal stages up to postnatal day  <dig>  <cit>  cdkl <dig> mrna is expressed in brain and all other tissues  <cit> . cdkl <dig> protein levels are known to coincide with its mrna levels  <cit> .

even though these three genes have different expression patterns, distinct functions and specific regulatory targets, their paths appear to intersect. both mecp <dig> and foxg <dig> proteins regulate transcription via dna binding and association with other transcriptional regulators  <cit> . the functions of mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> proteins also appear to be interconnected. mecp <dig> has multiple phosphorylation sites  <cit>  and is a target of cdkl <dig> phosphorylation. additionally, there are contradictory reports on the expression level of cdkl <dig> protein and mrna in the absence of mecp <dig> . altogether, these observations suggest that the overlapping features in rett syndrome may be caused by impairment of common or intersecting biological pathways downstream of expression in the brain. alternately, these genes may be interdependent on each other for expression or regulation, which may lead to the overlap in phenotypic features.

although we have some knowledge of their downstream intersecting functions, we are yet unaware of the common genomic features between these three genes, which may provide insights into their regulation. importantly, although both mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> genes are expressed ubiquitously, their mutations cause a brain specific phenotype suggesting that their expression level, transcription regulation, or function in brain may be distinct from that in other tissues. we tried to resolve these questions through bioinformatics analyses using the fantom <dig> dataset  <cit> .

data from fantom <dig> provide the unprecedented opportunity to identify the transcription start sites  of these genes and study their expression profile in hundreds of mouse and human samples using cap analysis of gene expression method   <cit> . in conjunction with the recently released encode dataset  <cit> . fantom <dig> data also enable the identification of regulatory histone marks at tsss. since the rtt phenotype is reflected in the mecp <dig> ko mouse model  <cit>  and studies on this disorder are conducted in mouse tissues and cells, we also included mouse samples in our analyses. we analyzed the tss expression data from the fantom <dig> project using over  <dig> human and over  <dig> mouse samples to identify common and diverse features of the genomic architecture of the three genes implicated in rtt . for our investigation, we divided the human and mouse samples into tissues, primary cells and cell lines to study the expression levels of the tss of the three genes in various samples. our data reveal the precise initiation sites for the three genes, including previously unknown tsss for foxg <dig> in mouse and humans. we show that each of these genes use the same tss in most tissues and provide information on the expression level of the three genes over development in multiple human and mouse samples. although we did not find a significant correlation between the expression levels of the three genes in the brain, our genome wide analyses uncovered common transcription factors regulating the three genes, suggesting an additional molecular layer in the pathogenesis of rett syndrome. the fantom <dig> cage dataset also allowed us to locate putative enhancers regulating the three genes in human  and using mouse encode chip-seq data, we identified genomic regions bearing promoter and enhancer marks. this work is part of the fantom <dig> project. data downloads, genomic tools and co-published manuscripts are summarized here: http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/.

methods
fantom <dig> samples
single molecule cage profiles were generated from rna obtained from a collection of  <dig> human primary cell samples  covering most mammalian cell steady states. this data set was complemented with profiles of  <dig> different cancer cell lines,  <dig> human post-mortem tissues and  <dig> mouse samples . primary cells for neurons and astrocytes discussed in this manuscript were obtained from sciencell research laboratories. human neurons were isolated from the human brain, cryopreserved at primary cultures and delivered frozen. human astrocytes were isolated from cerebral cortex and cerebellum. both were cryopreserved at passage one and delivered frozen.

all human samples used in the project were either exempted material , or provided under informed consent. all non-exempt material is covered under riken yokohama ethics applications . mouse tissue samples were collected as per riken yokohama institutional guidelines. mouse primary cells were collected as per our collaborators institutional guidelines and shipped as either purified rna or as guanidinium isothyocyanate lysates  which were then purified using the mirneasy kit . more detailed information for each specific sample is available in additional file:  <dig> table s <dig> of  <cit> .

all the data published by the fantom <dig> project and by this study are available through the fantom <dig> portal http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/data/. all cage data has been deposited at ddbj dra under accession number dra <dig> 

identifying cage derived transcription start sites
we used the fantom <dig> database  to identify transcription start sites  for our genes, using the decomposition peak identification  clustering and nomenclature developed for the fantom <dig> project  <cit> . we selected robust cage defined dpi clusters falling inside the refseq regions known to be associated to the three genes. to select for genuine tsss we used the fantom <dig> tss classifier and restricted our tss selection to those with a value of  <dig>  and above  <cit> . the tsss were annotated using the names assigned to clusters in the fantom <dig> resource browser . annotation files were built in the context of the fantom <dig> project with respect to gencode v <dig> gene model , refseq , cpg islands and tata box in bed format.

tss expression
we extracted expression information for each tsss using the fantom <dig> expression dataset for tissues, cell lines and primary cells in human and mouse . the expression values are shown in tags per million  calculated on a per-library total expression. we discarded all the tsss that did not have over  <dig> tpm expression in any of the samples. all expression level figures, heatmaps and correlations were calculated using r .

mecp <dig> and histone expression comparison
we extracted the cage defined promoters associated to the genes whose products form the histone <dig> transcripts . all the values for different genes were added together and compared to expression levels of mecp <dig> 

identifying tss overlaps with chip seq data from human and mouse encode tsss
tsss identified were expanded by  <dig> nucleotides on either side . chip seq data from human and mouse encode were downloaded as bed files and intersected with our expanded tss using intersectbed  <cit> .

defining human enhancers
to identify enhancers associated with the human rett genes, we used the cage derived enhancer database from andersson et al.  <cit> . in short, the identified enhancers from andersson et al. within 500kb distance from the identified rett genes promoters were selected  <cit> . the expression of pairs of enhancers and promoters was then compared in all the human samples using a pearson correlation test. the resulting comparisons were then corrected for multiple testing using bonferroni correction. only enhancers significantly correlated  with any of the three rett genes promoters were included.

transcription factor binding site  analysis
we downloaded the whole-genome alignment of the human genome with  <dig> other vertebrate genomes, and of the mouse genome with  <dig> other vertebrate genomes, from the ucsc genome browser database  <cit> . from these alignments, we retained the alignments between the human, macaque, mouse, rat, cow, horse, dog, opossum, and chicken genomes only, and used the t-coffee alignment tool  <cit>  on  <dig> bp segments of the genome to optimize the alignment for the nine selected genomes. we then ran motevo  <cit>  on these whole-genome alignments using a background prior probability of  <dig> , a prior for the ufe  model of  <dig> relative to the weight matrices, a ufe motif length of  <dig> base pairs, and a uniform background sequence probability. a posterior probability calculated by motevo for a putative tfbs was retained if it was at least  <dig> . we used the center position for a given cage promoter on the genome as a reference point, and summed the posterior probabilities for the putative binding sites for each transcription factor within a distance of  <dig> basepairs of the reference point to obtain the estimated number of binding sites for each transcription factor. to evaluate the statistical significance of this number, for each transcription factor we estimated the number of binding sites in exactly the same way for all  <dig>   or  <dig>   promoters in the fantom <dig> data sets, and ranked the promoters accordingly. the tail probability was then obtained by dividing the rank of the promoter of interest by  <dig>   or  <dig>  .

RESULTS
foxg1expression in mouse and humans
analyses of tss from  <dig> human samples and  <dig> mouse samples comprised of tissues, primary cells and cell lines  identified  <dig> tsss for human foxg <dig> and  <dig> tsss for mouse foxg <dig> . foxg <dig> expression above  <dig> tpm was found in 23%  and 30%  of human and mouse samples respectively, suggesting that the expression of this gene was limited to selected tissues . transcription start sites were defined as novel if they were found at a distance of over  <dig> bp from the known refseq tsss. our data show  <dig> tsss in mouse highly expressed in brain sub-regions and cells, two of which are novel. the expression levels of different tsss of foxg <dig> were variable in human and mouse samples, with the highest expression seen in specific regions of the brain . the top three initiation sites were located at  chr12: <dig> . <dig> +;  chr12: <dig> . <dig> +;  and chr12: <dig> . <dig> +; . expression of mouse foxg <dig> was also restricted to brain tissue and brain related cells, but surprisingly the two novel tsss of mouse foxg <dig> were also found highly expressed in the single mouse cell line sequenced in the fantom <dig> project  suggesting that other than the brain, fibroblast cell lines may be useful for in vitro analysis of foxg <dig> in mouse .figure  <dig>

in human, there is refseq annotation support for a single foxg <dig> isoform and therefore a single tss. we found  <dig> tsss for human foxg <dig> expressed over  <dig> tpm and the  <dig> tsss with the highest expression in human brain were located at chr14: <dig> . <dig> + ; chr14: <dig> . <dig> + ; and chr14: <dig> . <dig> + , with distances of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases upstream of the refseq annotated tss, respectively . thus, our analyses reveal that in human brain the highest used tss for foxg <dig> is located  <dig> bases upstream of the annotated start site. contrary to mouse, where we found expression level differences of over 10-fold between tsss, in human samples, the difference in expression between the three tsss was less than 2-fold .

intriguingly, we did not find foxg <dig> expression in mouse or human cerebellum suggesting silencing of foxg <dig> in cerebellum. inability to detect tss expression may result from technical artifacts such as low expression levels not discernible at the conducted depth of sequencing or the use of an alternate tissue specific start site. to rule out technical artifacts, we referred to the encode dataset to investigate signs of transcriptional activity in the chromosomal location of foxg <dig> and up to  <dig> kb upstream in mouse cerebellum. we analyzed encode data for dnase-i hypersensitive sites , which are known to faithfully recognize active transcription initiation sites  <cit> , in mouse cerebellum, cerebrum and whole brain. our analyses revealed an absence of dnase-i hss in mouse cerebellum, while dnase-i hss were present in cerebrum and whole brain samples . since dnase-i hss usually coincide with the active promoter specific histone mark of trimethylated histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>   <cit>  and transcriptionally active enhancers may also bear the specific histone mark of acetylated histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> , we looked for these two marks in mouse cerebellum and mouse cortex. we found that h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac were enriched at the locus in 8-week old cortex samples, but not in 8-week old cerebellum samples. surprisingly, our investigations revealed trimethylated histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  enrichment at this chromosomal locus in mouse cerebellum, suggesting silencing of foxg <dig> by polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  . since chip data for active and repressive histone marks in human brain is not available from encode at this time, we were unable to confirm similar chromatin signatures for prc <dig> silencing of foxg <dig> in the human cerebellum.

silencing by chromatin remodeling proteins such as prc <dig> requires a non-coding rna to mediate chromatin modification  <cit> . therefore, we searched for potential cis-regulatory ncrnas that may mediate foxg <dig> silencing. we found one ncrna downstream of foxg <dig> , however its expression was not entirely discordant with that of foxg <dig> . analysis of the ncrna database and manual annotation of ucsc genome browser revealed several ncrnas within a genomic window of  <dig>  mb around foxg <dig>  but none of the listed ncrnas were detectable in the fantom <dig> cage dataset.

mecp2expression in mouse and humans
in humans and mouse we identified two tsss for mecp <dig>  less than  <dig> bases upstream of the refseq annotated start sites of which p1@mecp2/mecp <dig> was expressed predominantly in most tissues and p2@mecp2/mecp <dig> displayed a stable low level expression in all tissues  . we found an additional intronic promoter  in humans alone, expressed exclusively in blood primary cells, particularly in cd <dig> monocytes . expression of p1@mecp <dig> in humans and mouse was found above  <dig> tpm in most tissues, primary cells and cell lines, suggesting that transcripts arising from this promoter were ubiquitously expressed. surprisingly our analysis of human tissues and cells revealed that the highest expression of mecp <dig> was seen in non-neuronal tissues  and cell lines  . in agreement with previous reports in mouse, we found that at mrna level, the expression of p1@mecp <dig> in astrocytes  was much lower than in neurons   but among human primary cells, the expression of p1@mecp <dig> in neurons  was lower than the p1@mecp <dig> expression in astrocytes . in contrast with the brain, the expression levels of mecp <dig> protein in the heart are reportedly higher in embryonic stages than in postnatal heart  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the expression levels of mecp <dig> during development in heart, liver and kidney. our analyses showed that in heart, mecp <dig> expression fluctuated during embryonic stages and was higher than at postnatal day  <dig>  and p <dig>  in kidney, the expression of mecp <dig> declined after p <dig> and in liver the expression of mecp <dig> appeared to be induced after birth  but remained unstable up to the age of p <dig> .

cdkl5expression in humans and mouse
the refseq database annotates one tss for cdkl <dig> in mouse and two tsss in human . our analyses identified two tsss within  <dig> bp of the annotated tss in mouse and the upstream tss in human samples . in both human and mouse samples, cdkl <dig> expression was higher in brain tissues than in primary cells or cell lines . the two tsss of cdkl <dig> were co-expressed ubiquitously in human and mouse, however p1@cdkl <dig> was expressed more than p2@cdkl <dig> in most tissues in humans suggesting that transcripts arising from p1@cdkl <dig> may be over-represented in humans . in mouse p1@cdkl <dig> and p2@cdkl <dig> were expressed at similar levels in some brain sub-regions. we tracked the expression of cdkl <dig> in mouse heart, liver and kidney over development from embryonic day  <dig> to postnatal day  <dig>  these tissues were previously reported to have undetectable levels of cdkl <dig> <cit> . in heart, the expression levels of cdkl <dig> fluctuated up to p <dig> . in liver and kidney, cdkl <dig> expression from both tsss was lower in adult  than embryonic tissues . this observation was in contrast to the brain where the expression of cdkl <dig> was generally higher in postnatal brain in both mouse and humans . in agreement with published data  <cit>  we found restricted expression of cdkl <dig> in mouse astrocytes .

developmental profile for the three genes in brain sub regions
the expression levels of foxg <dig>  mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> are developmentally regulated in the brain. foxg <dig> expression is reported to be highest during early embryogenesis  <cit> . cdkl <dig> is weakly expressed during embryogenesis in the cortex and its expression increases in postnatal stages until p <dig> after which cdkl <dig> expression is diminished  <cit> . mecp <dig> protein levels in the brain increase as development proceeds stabilizing around postnatal day  <dig>  <cit> . we investigated if the reported developmental expression profile for the three proteins was reflected at the tss level. for mouse, we investigated the developmental tss expression of mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> in the cerebellum , pituitary cortex  and visual cortex . our data reveal that p1@mecp <dig> expression fluctuates in embryonic cerebellum samples but is clearly induced after postnatal day  <dig> . the expression of p1@cdkl <dig> and p2@cdkl <dig> in mouse closely resemble the pattern of expression of p1@mecp <dig> but at lower levels. these data are in agreement with protein expression levels of cdkl <dig> and mecp <dig> reported previously in cerebellum by rusconi et al.  <cit> . in visual cortex samples, where we investigated a broader time course we found a striking resemblance of expression pattern between p1@mecp <dig> and p2@cdkl <dig> with both genes showing an increase from p <dig> to p <dig> and stabilizing from p <dig> to p <dig>  while the expression of p1@cdkl <dig> remained steady. in contrast, the expression of pa@foxg <dig> decreased as visual cortex matured . similarly, in the pituitary gland, we found the expression of cdkl <dig> and mecp <dig> to fluctuate during embryonic stages, while foxg <dig> displayed high expression during embryonic stages with lowest expression in adult.

in broad time-course samples of fetal, neonate and adult human brain sub-regions we found that foxg <dig> expression was generally higher in fetal samples  while the expression of both promoters of cdkl <dig> and p1@mecp <dig> in fetal samples were lower than their expression level in adults .

comparison between mecp2and histone h <dig> expression level in neurons
skene et al. previously showed that in wild-type mouse neurons, the density of mecp <dig> protein is one molecule per two nucleosomes - equal to that of histone h <dig>  which is also one molecule per two nucleosomes  <cit> . we investigated whether the similarity between mecp <dig> and histone h <dig> protein density was reflected at the mrna level in human and mouse neurons. we also compared the expression level of histone h <dig> and mecp <dig> tss in brain sub regions even though skene et al. <cit>  had not reported a correlation between the levels of the two proteins in whole brain tissue . we extracted the expression for all h <dig> transcripts and compared their individual and collective levels to p1@mecp <dig> expression in both human and mouse. the primary cells in mouse included neurons from various brain sites as well as astrocytes and microglia cells. our data show that the combined as well as individual expression levels of all histone h <dig> transcripts were much higher than the expression levels of p1@mecp <dig> at all ages in all samples . in raphe neurons, substantia nigra neurons , ventral spinal cord neurons  and hippocampal astrocytes, we found the expression level of a few histone transcripts closer to the expression level of mecp <dig> . overall, this is interesting, because in order to reconcile this with the findings of skene et al., substantial changes in either protein production or decay of mecp <dig> and/or the histone  <dig> proteins must occur to offset the mrna steady state.

intra gene and inter gene expression correlations between foxg <dig>  cdkl5and mecp2in brain sub-regions
to investigate the relationship between the expression of all tsss of each gene, we conducted intra gene correlations and found a high degree of correlation between p1@foxg <dig> and p3@foxg <dig> in human samples and between the promoters pa@foxg <dig>  pb@foxg <dig>  p1@foxg <dig> and p2@foxg <dig> in mouse . the two tsss of mecp <dig> were moderately but positively correlated with each other in humans and mouse, while the two tsss of cdkl <dig> were highly correlated in mouse  confirming our earlier observation of similarities in expression of the two cdkl <dig> promoters in mouse.table  <dig>

since mutations in the mecp <dig>  foxg <dig> and cdkl <dig> genes result in overlapping neurological phenotypes, we additionally investigated the inter gene expression correlations of the three genes in the brain. we first generated heatmaps from all brain sub-regions and brain related primary cells  for the three genes. we found that in humans and mouse the expression of p1@foxg <dig> and pa@foxg <dig> in brain was strikingly discordant with the expression of p1@mecp <dig> and p1@mecp <dig> respectively . next, we investigated the correlation between the highly expressed promoters of the three genes using spearman’s rank test and pearson’s correlation coefficients. based on our earlier heatmap visualization of contrasting expression of mecp <dig> and foxg <dig> in brain tissue, we expected to see a negative correlation between the promoters of these genes in both species. our data generated from all brain tissues, neurons and astrocytes showed that in mouse the correlation between pa@foxg <dig> and p1@mecp <dig> expression was poor  and in humans we found negative correlation of − <dig> , suggesting slight discordance of expression of the two genes in brain. thus, our analyses failed to find mathematically significant evidence of contrasting expression between foxg <dig> and mecp <dig>  the two promoters of cdkl <dig> were also poorly correlated with the foxg <dig> promoter expression in brain, while there was a positive correlation  between expression of mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> in both species .figure  <dig>

identification of regulatory regions of the three genes
to identify the regulatory regions associated with the tss of the three genes in mouse, we extended our tss co-ordinates by 500bp on either side and intersected them with active histone regulatory marks of h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> from encode datasets. based on current literature , on chromatin modifications marking active enhancers and promoters, we defined the criteria for active enhancers as those regions carrying the h3k27ac mark and active promoters as those regions carrying the h3k4me <dig> without complete overlap with the h3k27ac mark.

since all three genes were found highly expressed in the cortex, we used encode chip tracks for  <dig> week old cortex for this analysis. based on our results we derived gene models for the three genes in mouse cortex . our data revealed that the investigated regulatory marks for mouse foxg <dig>  were distinct and non-overlapping . we found that the main tsss pa@foxg <dig> and pb@foxg <dig> were located between an enhancer specific histone mark upstream and a promoter specific histone mark downstream . in contrast, for mecp <dig>  we found the enhancer and promoter specific histone marks to coincide in this tissue . the mecp <dig> tsss p1@mecp <dig> and p2@mecp <dig> were upstream but within  <dig> bp of the histone specific marks for enhancer and promoter. for cdkl <dig>  we found a partial overlap between enhancer and promoter specific histone marks. the p1@cdkl <dig> was located within the promoter specific histone mark while the enhancer specific histone mark was found upstream . the tss p2@cdkl <dig> was also located within  <dig> bp of these marks.figure  <dig> 
mouse gene models derived from fantom <dig> tss and encode chip data. gene models for foxg1
, mecp2
 and cdkl5
 were drawn for the main tss for each gene and the encode histone chip marks for  <dig> week mouse cortex. for foxg <dig>  the enhancer mark was  <dig> kb upstream and the promoter mark was  <dig>  kb downstream of the tss. for mecp <dig>  the tss was upstream of the overlapping promoter and enhancer mark. for cdkl <dig>  the tss was within the promoter and the enhancer was upstream of the tss.



as a complementary analysis, we identified human enhancers for the three genes using the database provided in  <cit>  that predicts active enhancers based on the expression of balanced bi-directional low expressed enhancer rna transcripts. for foxg <dig>  mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig>  we found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significantly correlated cis-enhancers respectively . in contrast to the mouse cortex data, the predicted enhancers in human samples were found kilo bases away from each gene suggesting long-range complex regulation of the three genes in humans. for foxg <dig> the most highly correlated enhancer  was located 7kb upstream of the gene. many predicted enhancers for mecp <dig> had an average correlation of  <dig> , the closest enhancer  had an expression correlation of  <dig> , while the highest correlated enhancer  was over 408kb distant. for cdkl <dig>  the only identified active enhancer had a low correlation of  <dig>  and was located over  <dig> kb upstream of the gene . interestingly, our data revealed that in humans, the only enhancer displaying the expected high correlation with gene expression was for the tissue specific gene foxg <dig> 

cpg/tata regulation of the three rett genes and their promoter shapes
to investigate the regulation of the promoters of the three genes, we analyzed computationally, the presence of cpg islands and tata boxes in the vicinity of the promoters of the three genes. intersections of cpg and tata ucsc bed files, with our extracted list of tsss, revealed that the three genes had tata-less promoters in both species. our data showed both promoters of mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> within cpg islands in both species. for foxg <dig>   <dig> tsss in mouse and  <dig> tsss in human samples appeared to be regulated by cpg islands .table  <dig>

promoters were listed as tata-less if a tata-box was absent  <dig> bp upstream of the promoter. similarly in the absence of a cpg island within  <dig> bp of the tss, the promoter was classified as cpg-less.



it is known that promoters regulated by tata boxes are ‘sharp’ where transcript initiation occurs at a well defined dominant site, no more than  <dig> consecutive nucleotides long, while promoters regulated by cpg islands are ‘broad’ where multiple start sites can be detected in a broad genomic region  <cit> . we analyzed the extracted tsss for sharp or broad shapes by aligning their expression levels across the genomic locus. for our investigation, we defined sharp promoters as those where the majority of the transcripts start from a single dominant tss or from multiple tsss within  <dig> nucleotides, while promoters were classified as broad when they had multiple dominating initiation sites within a defined tss cluster . we analyzed in humans and mouse, the  <dig> main promoters for foxg <dig> and two promoters each for mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig>  our analyses revealed that the main promoters for foxg <dig> in both species  were broad in keeping with the cpg islands in their vicinity . the second highest expressed foxg <dig> promoters in human and mouse  appeared to have species-specific shapes and regulation. while p2@foxg <dig> in humans was found to be sharp with no tata-box or cpg island, pb@foxg <dig> in mouse was broad and cpg regulated . in each species we found for foxg <dig>  one sharp promoter  devoid of tata box or cpg island .figure  <dig> 
shapes of key promoters of the three genes. promoter shapes were drawn for the key promoters of the three genes  based on the location of the first nucleotide in all tissues in mouse  and humans . shape conservation is seen across the two species in all promoters except pb of foxg <dig> in mouse and p <dig> of foxg <dig> in humans. despite the closeness in location and high correlation between p <dig> and p <dig> of cdkl <dig>  we find variation in their shapes suggesting differential regulation in both species.



the two main promoters of mecp <dig> were broad, in agreement with the cpg islands near their tss . in both species, the promoter p1@cdkl <dig> was broad in shape while p2@cdkl <dig> was sharp despite the presence of a cpg island in its vicinity . a comprehensive list of promoters, their regulation and shapes is shown in table  <dig> and additional file 15: figure s <dig>

to identify transcription factors binding to the three genes in both species, we analyzed the genomic sequence within  <dig> bp from the promoters of the three genes using the swissregulon database of sequence motifs associated with transcription factors  <cit>  . we found a putative binding site with a posterior probability greater than  <dig>  in the human foxg <dig>  mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> promoter regions for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tfs respectively . of these, binding sites for the three transcription factors rreb <dig>  foxp <dig> and nfy were found in all three genes, suggesting that the three genes implicated in rett syndrome may be regulated by the same tfs in humans. we then summed the posterior probabilities over each promoter region to estimate the number of binding sites for each transcription factor and evaluated its statistical significance . the data reveal that in human, the sequence around the main promoter of foxg <dig> in human was significantly enriched in binding sites for the rreb <dig> , foxp <dig> , and nfy  transcription factors. nfy was also predicted to regulate mecp <dig>  and possibly cdkl <dig> . similar analyses in the mouse genome revealed motifs for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tfs within  <dig> bp of the foxg <dig>  mecp <dig> and the cdkl <dig> promoters respectively . in mouse although all tfs with binding sites in the mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig> promoter regions also appeared to have binding sites in the foxg <dig> promoter region, only  <dig> tfs  were common to all three genes. calculating the statistical significance of the estimated number of binding sites revealed that in mouse for all three genes the promoter regions were enriched for motifs associated with transcription factor nfy, as well as sp <dig> .table  <dig>

discussion
our analyses of the fantom <dig> cage data reveal multiple sites for transcript initiation and identify the predominantly used tsss of the three genes implicated in rtt. mutation testing for rtt is currently performed solely on known coding exons, even though it has been suggested that the non-coding regulatory regions may play a role in the pathogenesis of rtt  <cit> . our data show that the highly used tsss lie upstream of currently annotated start sites and we propose that these regions be included in testing to ensure accurate representation of genes in diagnosis.

in our investigation we found the expression of foxg <dig> strikingly in contrast with the expression of mecp <dig> in the brain, but we could not get firm negative correlation for this observation of discordance in expression. this discrepancy may be due to the high expression level of foxg <dig> transcripts and the variable but comparatively low-level expression of mecp <dig> mrna in the brain. alternately, our visual observation may have resulted from the fact that some brain regions in mouse  and humans  are clearly devoid of foxg <dig> expression at any developmental stage. we further confirmed our observation of the absence of foxg <dig> expression in mouse cerebellum through analyses of chromatin signatures from mouse encode. our investigation revealed enrichment of h3k27me <dig> in the foxg <dig> genomic region, suggesting prc <dig> mediated silencing of foxg <dig> in the cerebellum. although h3k27me <dig> has also been reported to be present at transcriptionally active or poised loci  <cit> , the absence of active chromatin marks in the foxg <dig> promoter region in cerebellum but not in the cortex, strongly suggest specific repression of foxg <dig> in the cerebellum. a similar examination in liver also revealed h3k27me <dig> enrichment at the foxg <dig> promoter region . it is tempting to propose prc <dig> mediated silencing as a universal mechanism to restrict foxg <dig> expression to brain. it is known that prc <dig> mediated silencing is facilitated through long ncrnas  <cit> , but our screening did not reveal potential regulatory long ncrnas in the vicinity of foxg <dig> suggesting such regulation might be mediated by ncrnas located outside our window of investigation. it would be interesting to identify the long ncrnas involved in foxg <dig> silencing and investigate their contribution to the disease phenotype.

despite the known discrepancy in mrna and protein levels of mecp <dig> <cit> ), we found that similar to mecp <dig> protein  <cit> , mecp <dig> mrna expression was low in embryonic stages and high in adult stages in most brain regions except the cerebellum, where its expression was comparatively high in embryonic tissues as well. we also examined the relation between histone h <dig> and mecp <dig> at the mrna level. our data show that in each brain related sample, histone h <dig> transcript expression is 10– <dig> fold greater than mecp <dig> transcript expression. therefore, for these gene transcripts to produce equal amounts of protein, as suggested in skene et al., massive up-regulation of protein translation is required from mecp <dig> transcripts or massive down-regulation of protein translation is needed from histone transcripts. thus our data point to another layer of regulatory control between transcription and translation to equalize the protein output from low expressed mecp <dig> transcripts and abundantly expressed histone h <dig> transcripts. the presence of inverted sine elements in the vicinity of promoters have been reported to up-regulate protein translation  <cit>  but we did not find a similar configuration of sine near the mecp <dig> promoter.

the mecp <dig> gene gives rise to two mrna isoforms with same transcription start site  <cit>  and despite the fact that our analyses revealed two tsss for mecp <dig> in humans and mouse in all tissues, we could not allocate two distinct start sites for the two isoforms of mecp <dig>  based on our data, we were unable to conclude whether p2@mecp2/mecp <dig> represented an independent poorly expressed protein coding isoform, a shorter non-coding regulatory ncrna transcript arising from the vicinity of the main promoter p1@mecp2/mecp <dig> or a tissue specific enhancer rna   <cit>  for mecp <dig>  almost 25% of all enhancers are expected to transcribe short bi-directional capped transcripts called e-rnas  <cit> . our observations of stable low expression level of p2@mecp2/mecp <dig> sometimes below  <dig> tpm irrespective of the expression level of p1@mecp2/mecp <dig>  its poor correlation with p1@mecp2/mecp <dig> expression and the absence bi-directional transcripts at p2@mecp2/mecp <dig>  do not support its identification as an e-rna for mecp <dig>  the two tsss for cdkl <dig> are highly correlated with each other in mouse as well as humans. based on their similar expression levels and distinct promoter shapes, we propose that they represent two independently regulated transcripts despite their proximity.

the comparison between corresponding promoters in human and mouse samples, including the novel promoter p1@foxg <dig> in human and pa@foxg <dig> in mouse, revealed remarkably similar shapes, suggesting evolutionary conservation in their regulation. the only exceptions were the human p2@foxg <dig> and pb@foxg <dig> mouse, which due to their distinctive promoter shapes appear to be regulated in a species-specific manner.

the recently released encode histone chip seq data  <cit> , allowed us to distinguish, among our identified tss, active enhancers from active promoters  <cit>  in mouse. despite the presence of enhancer specific histone mark of h3k27ac, we could not find evidence of low-level antisense transcripts at the enhancer marks in mouse suggesting that enhancers at close range that do not generate e-rnas may regulate the three genes in mouse. for human samples the histone chip data were not available, but we found correlated e-rnas at distal locations from the tsss. our data suggest that in humans the three genes may be regulated by e-rna producing enhancers at long range. it is unclear at this stage whether this discrepancy reflects true species-specific differences or if it reflects differences in data analyses . further experimental validation is required to confirm whether these regions identified in our study play a regulatory role in the expression of the respective genes.

almost 20% patients of atypical rtt do not have mutations in the three genes. we conducted genome wide tfbs analyses with the aim to discover the common transcription factors likely to regulate the three genes and thus identify shared pathways upstream. mutations or functional impairment of such common tfs may affect the expression of the three genes, which may result in disease phenotype. our data predict that tfs nfy and sp <dig> are likely to regulate foxg <dig> and mecp <dig> but not cdkl <dig> in humans and nfy is likely to regulate all three genes in mouse. further investigation will be needed to experimentally verify these findings nevertheless, it will be of interest to study the expression level and presence of mutations in the common tfs in mutation negative rtt patients.

our investigations failed to demonstrate brain specific promoter usage or particularly high levels of expression of mecp <dig> in brain or neurons, which could have explained the predominantly neurological phenotype seen in patients with mutations in this ubiquitously expressed gene.

CONCLUSIONS
our comprehensive analyses of data from the fantom <dig> project reveal novel insights into the common and distinct genomic features of the three genes, which are related not only by disease phenotype, but also in their regulation in a species-specific manner.
