BACKGROUND
plant disease is a rare event in natural environments, as constant improvement of defence programs effectively controls most microbial pathogens. in addition to pre-formed barriers, plants typically exhibit two lines of inducible defence responses. first, a surveillance system detects pathogens by sensing microbe-associated molecular patterns  or host-self modified components to activate pattern triggered immunity 
 <cit> . this broad-spectrum immune response activates a complex signaling cascade, including the early and transient accumulation of reactive oxygen species , the deposition of the beta-glucan callose at the plant cell wall and a massive transcriptional reprogramming
 <cit> .

although pti effectively restricts the majority of “non-adapted” pathogens, particular “adapted” microbes can inactivate this pathway establishing compatible interactions with the plant. this latter condition implies an intimate communication between host and invader, and requires the coordinated action of pathogen-derived effectors over their host molecule targets
 <cit> . these host targets are elements of defence signaling cascades, metabolic pathways, or structural cell components, whose modification by effectors favors pathogen’s nutrition or growth and thus can be considered as "compatibility factors"
 <cit> .

a second line of defence participates in the control of adapted pathogens. this response involves the action of resistance proteins  which recognize effectors, or products of their activity, to induce effector triggered immunity  providing race-specific resistance. pti and eti share several components but only eti leads to the collapse of invaded cells, generating a hypersensitive response 
 <cit> . in addition, broad-spectrum resistance against several species of the same genera of pathogens may also display hr features
 <cit> . the components of these pathways have been deeply characterized over the past decades, including the plant hormones salicylic acid  and jasmonic acid , whose mutual balance modulates resistance to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens
 <cit> . in contrast, little is known about the nature or function of host compatibility factors supporting disease development. forward and reverse genetic approaches have revealed a few monogenic recessive loci whose loss of function reduced disease, therefore suggesting they encode compatibility components
 <cit> . conversely, interactomic approaches such as yeast-two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays, mostly identified defence-related elements as targets of biotrophic or hemi-biotrophic pathogen effectors
 <cit> .

the interaction of plants with powdery mildews  offers suitable conditions for the study of compatibility and identification of plant and pathogen factors supporting disease development. pms are adapted obligate pathogens par excellence, entirely depending on living tissue to grow and reproduce
 <cit> . compatibility with these pathogens requires a delicate balance between the successful extraction of resources and maintenance of host viability
 <cit> . in particular, three arabidopsis pm diseases have been well characterized, involving the following pm species: golovinomyces cichoracearum 
 <cit> , golovinomyces orontii 
 <cit> , and erysiphe cruciferarum <cit> . these pathosystems were used to clone genes involved in broad-spectrum disease resistance
 <cit>  and non-host resistance
 <cit> , as well as genes encoding compatibility factors
 <cit> . additionally, it has been recently described that another pm species, named oidium neolycopersici, is able to complete its life cycle in arabidopsis
 <cit> . interestingly, different a. thaliana accessions display variable levels of susceptibility to g. cichoracearum. among these, tenela  shows no macroscopic signs of disease, with a moderate resistance being conferred by a recessively inherited locus named rpw <dig>  raising the possibility that plant components necessary for pathogen development or propagation are missing or altered in te- <dig> plants
 <cit> . we here evaluated whether te- <dig> resistance may result from defects in the establishment of compatibility. the defence and infection features observed in this interaction, indicated that te- <dig> plants hold the formation of functional haustoria, but not the maturation of conidiophores. thus, this experimental system would result suitable for characterization of compatibility conditions affecting the final stages of pm differentiation.

RESULTS
pti/eti-like responses in te- <dig> plants infected with g. cichoracearum ucsc1
to evaluate the basis of te- <dig> resistance to g. cichoracearum, we monitored the activation of defence markers in this interaction. as controls, we used the fully susceptible columbia  plant, and the resistant kashmir  plant. in the last accession, rpw <dig>  an atypical r gene confers broad-spectrum resistance to several pm species by inducing sa-dependent defences, ros accumulation and cell death in a reaction similar to the hr activated by classical r genes
 <cit> . three cytological markers of pti/hr induction were initially analyzed, by monitoring accumulation of ros with  <dig>  diaminobenzidine 
 <cit> , deposition of callose at plant cell wall with aniline blue
 <cit> , and host cell death with lactophenol trypan blue
 <cit> .

accumulation of ros was detected in infected kas- <dig> plants  where almost 50% of the interaction sites showed dab staining at  <dig> hours post-inoculation . this response was stronger at  <dig> hpi reaching mesophyll cells close to conidia , resembling the response described for rpw8-mediated resistance
 <cit> . in contrast, te- <dig> and col- <dig> tissues harboring haustoria did not accumulate ros at  <dig> hpi , with near 10% of the interaction sites showing dab staining at  <dig> hpi . at  <dig> hpi, a faint dab staining was detected in 20%  or 26%  of interaction sites, mainly in cells harboring old haustoria . moreover, dab precipitation was not observed in te- <dig> epidermal/mesophyll cells supporting conidia with arrested germination . in agreement with these results, gst  transcript accumulation, which usually accompanies redox alterations, was not detected in te- <dig> infected tissues until  <dig> hpi .


callose deposits densely contouring epidermal cell walls were observed in kas- <dig> infected tissues at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, either at fungal contact sites or below non-germinated conidia . conversely, te- <dig> and col- <dig> infected epidermal cells, and adjacent mesophyll cells were devoid of callose deposits at the cell wall. in these two accessions fluorescence was detected around the haustoria , probably as consequence of fungal auto-fluorescence and/or callose encasements becoming brighter with haustorial age
 <cit> .

as expected, dead cells were also observed in infected kas- <dig> tissues. near half of the epidermal cells contacting the pathogen showed trypan blue staining at  <dig> hpi . later on, by  <dig> hpi, the few haustoria formed in these tissues were surrounded by plant stained cytoplasmic content . in addition, some mesophyll cells underlying the sites of interaction showed death signs in this plant . in contrast, cell death was almost absent in challenged te- <dig> and col- <dig> tissues until  <dig> hpi .

in a. thaliana, susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens is modulated by the balance between the sa- and ja- dependent defence pathways
 <cit> . we analyzed whether resistance of te- <dig> plants to g. cichoracearum resulted from constitutive expression or hyper-activation of these pathways. for this purpose, we monitored the expression of the sa-sensitive gene marker pr <dig> , and the ja- inducible genes lox <dig> , vsp <dig>  and pdf <dig>  .

uninfected tissues of col- <dig>  te- <dig> and kas- <dig> plants, showed no accumulation of pr <dig> transcript. after infection, pr <dig> activation was first detected in kas- <dig> , then in col- <dig>  and later on te- <dig> plants  . concerning the ja marker genes, pathogen-mediated vsp <dig> activation was weak and similar in all three plants . for lox <dig> and pdf <dig> , these were up-regulated in uninfected kas- <dig> and/or te- <dig>  with minor changes in expression after infection in te- <dig> plants. hence, the expression patterns of these gene markers suggested that the te- <dig> plants showed neither strong basal stimulation nor fungal-induced activation of the sa and ja pathways. to search for signs of alterations in the equilibrium between the sa and ja pathways in te- <dig>  we examined the transcriptional activity of two genes sensitive to the interaction between these pathways in response to g. cichoracearum. the genes were the sa-dependent and ja-repressible glycoside hydrolase , and the ja-dependent and sa-repressible tumor related protein 
 <cit> . we found that col- <dig> and te- <dig> plants expressed both genes with similar pattern during the course of infection .

in summary, our analysis suggested that resistance of te- <dig> plants to g. cichoracearum is not accompanied by constitutive activation of pti or exacerbation of eti pathways.

limiting stages for development of g. cichoracearum on te- <dig> plants
to analyze the progression of fungal disease in te- <dig> tissues, we evaluated the abundance and morphology of pathogen-derived structures during an infection time-course assay. we performed the same analysis using susceptible col- <dig> and resistant kas- <dig> plants, as controls. for g. cichoracearum, conidial germination is followed by the formation of primary germ tubes , penetration of epidermal cells and generation of haustoria  
 <cit> . then, secondary germ tubes  and ramified hyphae  contribute to form the fungal colonies, to finally differentiate the conidiophores , ending the fungal asexual reproductive cycle. normally, a mature cph  contains a five-conidia chain formed on a basal foot cell . occasionally, in some arabidopsis genetic backgrounds displaying resistance to g. cichoracearum, this fungus only forms immature cph  containing the fc and 1– <dig> conidia
 <cit> .

leaves inoculated with conidia were sampled every  <dig> h during the initial  <dig> hpi, stained with trypan blue and analyzed by bright-field optical microscopy to quantify fungal structures . compared to col- <dig> plants, conidial germination was severely reduced in kas- <dig> but less affected in te- <dig> plants . these differences were maintained until  <dig> hpi, where  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the inoculated conidia germinated in col- <dig>  te- <dig> and kas- <dig> plants, respectively . after germination, at  <dig> hpi, the pattern of fungal structures developed on te- <dig> tissues was very similar to the one found in col- <dig>  but substantially different to that observed on kas- <dig> tissues . at this time, comparable levels of r colonies were present in te- <dig> and col- <dig> plants , while this differentiation stage was never reached in kas- <dig> plants, where fungal development was stopped at the pgt  or ha  stages .

the fungal growth was delayed on te- <dig> with respect to col- <dig> plants in 6– <dig> h . interestingly, despite the presence of r colonies in te- <dig> plants , the formation of cph was severely reduced in these tissues . by scoring the number of cph  per colony, we found that col- <dig> tissues harbored  <dig> ±  <dig> cph/colony by  <dig> days post-inoculation  and a maximum of  <dig> ±  <dig> cph/colony at  <dig> dpi, while te- <dig> tissues showed no cph at  <dig> dpi, and just  <dig> ±  <dig> cph/colony at  <dig> dpi. this reduction in cph content was maintained until late infection stages suggesting it was not merely due to delayed fungal growth on te- <dig> plants. although the fungal colonies formed in te- <dig> were slightly smaller and less ramified than the ones developed in col- <dig> , the number of haustoria present in colonies of comparable size was similar for both plants . strikingly, most cph found in te- <dig> showed an incomplete development as they only reached the stage of icph .

in conclusion, conidia germinating in te- <dig> tissues were able to differentiate ha and form r colonies, but never completed the formation of mcph, suggesting the latter process is a limiting step for g. cichoracearum asexual reproduction in this plant.

structural features of the fungal haustoria formed in te- <dig> plants
formation of haustoria is key for the establishment of compatible interactions with plants, since these structures deliver effectors into host cells and provide nutrients for fungal proliferation
 <cit> . as te- <dig> plants supported the generation of small fungal colonies with negligible amounts of mcph, we decided to evaluate the formation of haustoria in these tissues. using electron microscopy, we compared the ultra-structural features of haustoria developed in te- <dig> and col- <dig> plants .

in these plants, the epidermal cells harboring haustoria showed no evidence of cell wall thickening or plasma membrane alterations . furthermore, no signs of organelle or cytoplasm disruption were found in these cells, which maintained intact nuclei located in the proximity of the haustorium . multi-lobbed haustoria , and abundant mitochondria and multi-vesicular bodies congregated around or inside haustoria  were present in both accessions. in addition, the electro-lucent appearance of the extrahaustorial matrix was similar in both plants , and discontinuities or alterations in fungal cell wall and extra haustorial membrane were not observed in these tissues.

to complement these studies, we compared the haustoria formed in te- <dig> with those generated in kas- <dig> plants. as no haustoria were present in ultra-microtome sections of kas- <dig> infected tissues, we used confocal microscopy for this purpose. here again, the haustoria developed on col- <dig> plants were analyzed as control. infected leaves were excised at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi, to be fixed and then stained with sulpho-rodamine b  and 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulphonic acid 
 <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first evidence about the use of these compounds for visualization of fungal haustoria inside plant cells , as they have been traditionally used to stain proteins and lipids, respectively
 <cit> . in parallel, dapi staining was applied to identify the haustorial nucleus .

at all examined stages, the haustoria generated in te- <dig> were indistinguishable from those developed in col- <dig>  but clearly different from the ones present in kas- <dig> plants, that actively counteract the fungal infection . col- <dig> and te- <dig> plants contained normal haustoria with single rounded nucleus, and vesicular-like compartments surrounded by a continuous thin structure likely corresponding to the ehm
 <cit>  . in contrast, 60-80% of haustoria formed on kas- <dig> were abnormal at this time , presenting cytoplasmic disorganization and fainting of dapi staining , which suggested a degenerative process. in col- <dig> and te- <dig> these abnormalities were only observed at  <dig> hpi for a small subset of haustoria . using 3d reconstruction of images taken at  <dig> hpi, the maximum haustorial diameter was determined, revealing similar values for te- <dig> and col- <dig> samples , and a significant reduction for haustorial diameter in kas- <dig>  respect to col- <dig> samples .

transport of l-arginine through haustoria established in te- <dig> plants
the haustorium of obligate biotrophic fungi like powdery mildews and rusts participates in the absorption of sugars, amino acids, s, p, and other nutrients required for fungal growth
 <cit> . to evaluate the functionality of the haustoria formed in te- <dig>  we analyzed their capacity to transport l-arginine c <dig>  from plant to fungal cells. in these experiments, leaf discs were excised at different times post-infection and floated for  <dig> h in argc <dig> solution. then, the fungal material present on the disks surface was stripped using an adhesive tape and the amount of c <dig> in the tape was quantified. sibling infected discs were sampled in parallel to determine the haustoria content per disc by trypan blue staining. in addition, discs from uninfected leaves were exposed to the same treatment to quantify and subtract the residual radioactivity transferred to the tape as result of the stripping process. similar assays have been previously used for identical purpose
 <cit> .

we found that kas- <dig> samples contained constant negligible levels of argc <dig> over the entire analyzed period . in contrast, te-0-derived strips revealed an increase in the argc <dig> content during infection, with these values representing almost half of those corresponding to col- <dig> samples until  <dig> hpi . over this period, the differences observed may probably result from delayed fungal proliferation on te- <dig> plants . considering this possibility, we normalized the levels of argc <dig> by the number of haustoria, and found no differences in the uptake of argc <dig> during the initial  <dig> hpi between mycelia installed in te- <dig> and col- <dig> plants . interestingly, at  <dig> hpi, a net increase in radioactivity was detected in col- <dig>  but not in te- <dig> samples. it was unknown whether this variation was also due to differences in fungal biomass. however, as maturation of cph occurred at this time in the sensitive plant, the result might suggest that higher levels of nutrients are required under such condition. in agreement with this, such an increase was never reached, even at later time points, in te- <dig> plants unable to hold mcph .

in conclusion, the results suggested that haustoria installed in te- <dig> function in a very similar manner to those formed in col- <dig> plants, at least with respect to the arg uptake. therefore, the conidiation deficiency observed in te- <dig> would not result from severe failures in the absorption of nutrients.

a. thaliana genes differentially expressed in te- <dig> plants during the interaction with g. cichoracearum
to further characterize the interaction between te- <dig> plants and g. cichoracearum, we identified genes having a differential expression in col- <dig> and te- <dig> tissues at late infection stages. for this purpose, cdna libraries were generated from tissue samples isolated at  <dig> hpi, and used in suppressive subtractive hybridization assays  to confront col- <dig>  <dig> hpi cdna samples  against te- <dig>  <dig> hpi cdnas samples . the resulting non-subtracted cdnas were cloned and sequenced, revealing  <dig> genes under-expressed in te- <dig> compared to col- <dig> samples. these differentially expressed genes encode for the following proteins: pr <dig>  methallothionein 1a , heat shock cognate protein  <dig>  , endoplasmin , grf7/gf14v 14-3- <dig> protein , sucrose transporter  <dig> , chlorophyll a/b binding protein lhcb <dig> , and an oxidoreductase. in principle, these genes could be considered markers of either ineffective defence activation or compatibility between a. thaliana and g. cichoracearum. we disregarded the study of defence-related genes encoding pr <dig>  oxidoreductase, and chlorophyll a/b binding protein, whose role and/or behavior has been previously characterized for infections with this pathogen
 <cit> .

we selected the remaining five genes and monitored their expression in untreated and fungal-inoculated col- <dig>  te- <dig> and kas- <dig> leaves . all genes became up-regulated in the col- <dig> tissues sustaining fungal growth, with maximum expression at 48– <dig> hpi, and activation until  <dig> hpi. consistent with the ssh assay, none of these genes were induced in te- <dig> infected tissues, even at  <dig> hpi when the fungal biomass resembled that found in col- <dig> tissues at  <dig> hpi . interestingly, in kas- <dig> plants the genes remained unaltered  or were down-regulated  by infection, indicating their activation was not associated with r-gene mediated resistance but rather with compatibility with g. cichoracearum.


discussion
pms establish long term relationships with their host forcing the maintenance of compatibility conditions
 <cit> . the large and diverse collections of effectors encoded in the pm genomes
 <cit>  might indicate redundant functions of these compounds on their target molecules in the plant. this may explain why gene-for-gene resistance has negligible effect on the control of pm diseases in the field, and why plant resistance is overcome without apparent loss of fitness by the pathogen
 <cit> . the identification of such effectors and their targets will be key to understand pm diseases, and design new alternatives to generate long-lasting passive resistance. to move in this direction, new experimental systems allowing the evaluation of compatibility as well as resistance by loss of susceptibility are required. in relation to the later condition, we have characterized the interaction between a. thaliana te- <dig> plants and g. cichoracearum, where the host offers compatibility conditions during the initial, but not later stages of infection. in this plant, conidial germination is partially reduced and fungal growth is slightly delayed. both features have been described in resistant interactions involving pti or eti/hr activation
 <cit> . however, te- <dig> infected tissues showed no signs of active defences , in a response clearly distinguishable from that of infected kas- <dig> tissues. therefore, te- <dig> resistance seems to be different from rpw8-mediated immunity, which confers broad-spectrum protection to powdery mildews in many different accessions of a. thaliana by activation of hr-like responses
 <cit> . the sa-dependent pathway mediating resistance to biotrophic pathogens was neither induced under basal conditions, nor over-stimulated in te- <dig> fungal-infected tissues. in addition, the ja signaling cascade did not seem to increase resistance against g. cichoracearum in te- <dig> plants. the lox <dig> and pdf <dig>  gene markers had mild basal expression without activation after infection, whereas vsp <dig> showed no basal expression and weak induction by pathogen, suggesting that resistance to the fungus was not due to major enhancement of ja-dependent defences. curiously, the effect of the ja pathway on the interaction of a. thaliana with pms is still unclear. the ja levels transiently increase in a. thaliana tissues infected with g. cichoracearum <cit> . resistance to pms is enhanced in wild type plants treated with ja, as well as in cev <dig> mutants that constitutively activate the ja pathway
 <cit> . however, the coi1- <dig> and jar1- <dig> mutants, impaired in the ja-pathway, are not hyper-susceptible to pms
 <cit> . therefore, in natural infection conditions, activation of the ja/et pathway may not be sufficient to confer resistance to pms
 <cit> .

te- <dig> plants did not show signs of premature senescence, alterations in size, or developmental-induced callose accumulation . neither did these plants stimulate strong defence features upon fungal infection. these observations argue against the possibility that resistance of te- <dig> plants might originate from mutations in genes encoding pmr <dig>  pmr <dig>  edr <dig>  edr <dig> and pux <dig>  previously described as pm-susceptibility factors, causing hyper-activation of defence responses
 <cit> .

in a. thaliana, pmr <dig> and the pectate lyase pmr <dig> have been recognized as factors that potentiate susceptibility to pms. pmr <dig> is involved in cell expansion whereas pmr <dig> functions in cell wall modeling
 <cit> , with both proteins being required for normal composition of plant cell wall pectin, and establishment of compatibility with pms. resistance of pmr5/pmr <dig> mutants does not involve the sa or ja/et pathways, resembling resistance of te- <dig> plants. however, these mutants are stunted, show reduction in cell size, constitutive sporadic mesophyll cell death, and deposition of auto-fluorescent compounds along the veins. as none of these features were observed in healthy or g. cichoracearum-infected te- <dig> tissues, it is likely that resistance does not result from deficient pmr5/ <dig> function in these plants.

to date, the two best characterized limiting stages for development of pms are penetration of epidermal cells
 <cit>  and development of haustoria
 <cit> . interestingly, g. cichoracearum was not prevented from reaching any of these stages in te- <dig> plants. more than 50% of inoculated conidia germinated in te- <dig> tissues further developing penetration hyphae and functional haustoria. in contrast, fungal asexual reproduction was the main limiting stage for proliferation of the pathogen in this plant. limitations in this developmental stage have been previously described for pm diseases in a. thaliana <cit> . in ascomycetes, coniditiation is regulated by several factors including inoculum density, light, temperature, humidity, and nutrient availability
 <cit> . while significant progress has been made in elucidating this developmental program in model fungi , its genetic basis and sensitivity to host clues remain elusive for obligate fungal biotrophs. in this sense, our results suggest that conidiation of g. cichoracearum in a. thaliana requires particular host conditions or signals which are present in col- <dig>  but not in te- <dig> plants. alternatively, te- <dig> might offer limitations for optimal fungal development affecting for instance nutrient uptake, which negatively impact on cph maturation, even though we found that the haustoria placed in these plants display normal assimilation of argc <dig> 

interestingly, te- <dig> supports abundant mycelial development and moderate conidiation of the g. cichoracearum relative erysiphe cruciferarum <cit>  and is susceptible to field isolates of the oomycete albugo spp. . thus, the following evidences support the possibility that te- <dig> is altered in components necessary for compatibility with g. cichoracearum: i) genetic nature of plant resistance , ii) susceptibility of the plant to other biotrophic pathogens, including a close relative species; iii) absence of active defences  in this interaction.

to characterize gene expression changes occurring under compatibility conditions, we looked for transcriptional differences in te-0- and col- <dig> infected tissues at the pre-conidiation stage. by ssh, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes, including classical defence-related genes , and genes affecting photosynthesis , which have been characterized elsewhere
 <cit> . the remaining  <dig> candidates  showed increased expression in response to pathogen in susceptible col- <dig> plants, but not in resistant kas- <dig> plants, indicating they are sensitive to compatibility conditions, but not to eti activation.

previous studies reported activation of some of these genes in response to fungal infections. this has been observed for stp <dig> during the interaction of a. thaliana with g. cichoracearum <cit> , and for mt1a and its rice homologue in response to other haustoria-forming fungi
 <cit> . in turn, hsp <dig>  is induced by the obligate biotrophic oomycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis 
 <cit> , whereas the end- <cit> , and grf7-homologues in barley are up-regulated by pms
 <cit> .

depletion of genes encoding host compatibility factors is predicted to reduce pathogen growth. however, the functional redundancy of these genes might hinder the effect of null mutations on single genes. conversely, an increased expression of one of these genes may generate tractable effects on the invader’s growth. consistent with this prediction, a. thaliana plants over-expressing hsp <dig>  are hyper-susceptible to h. arabidopsidis <cit> , and rice plants activating grfs show negative effects on defence-gene induction and cell death
 <cit> . furthermore, activation of mt1a leads to increased susceptibility to bacterial pathogens and reduced ros accumulation in casuarina glauca <cit> . curiously, plants over-expressing end are more sensitive to salt and drought stresses, although their responsiveness to pathogens has not been evaluated
 <cit> . therefore, taking these results together, the genes selected by our studies appear to be involved in responses to stress, with some of them acting in cell viability pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a detailed characterization of the interaction between the obligate biotrophic pathogen g. cichoracearum and the natural variant of the a. thaliana species, te- <dig>  we found that the limiting stage for fungal development in planta is the formation of condiophores. this limitation did not correlate with activation of cellular or molecular markers of pti and eti/hr. considering the genetic bases reported for resistance of te- <dig> plants 
 <cit> , we propose this phenotype may result from the inability of the plant to maintain compatibility conditions at later stages of infection. as te- <dig> did not show developmental or reproductive defects described in mutants lacking compatibility factors , its resistance would derive from alterations in novel compatibility factors. a preliminary search for such factors allowed identification of candidate compatibility gene markers that must be characterized in the future. furthermore, this work raises novel questions related to the control of g. cichoracearum asexual reproduction in planta, the existence of putative host molecular clues supporting this stage, and the contribution of the genes here identified to the establishment of compatibility with pms.
