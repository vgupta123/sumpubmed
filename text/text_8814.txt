BACKGROUND
detecting endosymbionts such as the widespread alphaproteobacterium wolbachia in its host cell environment requires reliable and ideally simple but still sensitive molecular marker systems. when such bacteria are present at high titers, classic end-point pcr is sufficient to unambiguously determine infection status of an unknown specimen. particularly for wolbachia, a quite comprehensive set of diagnostic pcr markers has been developed and applied successfully. the most commonly used among these makers is the multi locus sequence typing  system  <cit>  and the four hypervariable regions  of the wolbachia outer surface protein gene wsp <cit> . both mlst, comprising a set of five singlecopy wolbachia genes, and the wsp locus were demonstrated to be highly useful for wolbachia infection determination and consequent diversity assessment. however, those marker systems are limited if the endosymbiont persists at very low titers within the host, either only during a certain ontogenetic stage  <cit>  or throughout all life stages. in both cases proper detection of the endosymbiont is hindered and this points towards the need of an alternative strategy for efficient, robust and fast wolbachia detection. one approach to address this issue is to use multicopy wolbachia gene markers for pcr analyses. particularly insertion sequences  represent a good strategy to increase the detection threshold  <cit> . however, this approach relies on the conservation of such elements and their copy-numbers in diverse strains, which might not be the case over longer evolutionary distances due to the mobile nature of these elements. another approach to cope with the detection problem introduced by low-titer infections is ‘nested pcr’. this method might help to increase the detection threshold but is also highly prone to contamination  <cit> . a third strategy combines standard pcr with consequent hybridization  <cit> , which increases overall detection limit by four orders of magnitude  <cit> . on the other hand, this is an elaborate and time-consuming technique. hence, we set out to find a more sensitive marker for detection of low-titer wolbachia infections using standard pcr and identified arm as such a simple but ‘ultra-sensitive’ marker for a-supergroup wolbachia.

RESULTS
identification of a multicopy marker associated with tandem repeats in a-supergroup wolbachia genomes 
to find a marker that serves a highly sensitive detection method of low-titer wolbachia strains we identified multicopy regions in the a-supergroup wmel genome . an intergenic region of 440 bp associated with the recently described hypervariable tandem repeat region  was the most promising candidate, hereafter called arm  as it was found in  <dig> almost identical copies dispersed throughout the wmel genome . however, for a marker to be useful as a general tool it also needs to be conserved and present in multiple copies in other strains and we therefore used the wmel repeat sequence to search an additional  <dig> draft and complete wolbachia genomes from four different wolbachia supergroups for the same sequence. we were able to identify the presence of the repeat in seven a-supergroup wolbachia genomes , albeit in variable copy numbers. in the drosophila associated wolbachia strains, the copy numbers were around  <dig> per genome , whereas the other two a-supergroup genomes  contained about half the amount of copies. low number of hits in wuni is most likely explained by the incomplete status of the genome resulting in an underestimation of the actual copy number. in the b- , c- , and d-supergroup  genomes, arm was not found. even though some of the genomes in supergroups b, c, and d are incomplete, the total absence of the repeat in all genomes from these supergroups suggests that this motif might be wolbachia a-supergroup specific. additionally, vntr-tandem repeats associated with arm in a-supergroup infections are also absent from genomes of b- to d-supergroups, further indicating that this feature might indeed be a-supergroup specific.

arm facilitates detection of low-titer wolbachia from a-supergoup
arm-targeting primer were tested via end-point pcr screen on dna from high- and low-titer wolbachia infections in drosophila and glossina  species . as shown in figure  <dig>  the classic wolbachia singlecopy gene marker wsp  is only applicable for samples with high-titer infections, since wolbachia was only detected in high-titer d. paulistorum orinocan semispecies  as well as in d. willistoni , d. melanogaster , d. simulans  and glossina morsitans morsitans . the wsp primer failed to detect wolbachia in low-titer strains like d. paulistorum amazonian  and centroamerican  semispecies plus glossina swynnertoni , indicating that a singlecopy gene like wsp is not suited for tracking low-titer infections. as multicopy gene markers like insertion sequences  can be used to increase the detection limit, we ran pcr using primer for insertion sequence  <dig>  and in the a/o hybrid samples. however, is <dig> primer failed at amplifying the target sequence in all three glossina samples  despite the overall high wolbachia titer in gmm <cit> .

we have recently shown that wolbachia titers increase in d. paulistorum <cit>  and glossina <cit>  hybrid backgrounds, which should significantly facilitate detection and strain characterization. such titer increase was sufficient to detect wolbachia with the is <dig> primer set in a/o hybrids, but the low-titer wolbachia infection in the am mother still remained undetected . failure of is5-amplification in the gs/gm hybrid plus parents is explained by lacking homology between primer sequences and target, as no matches with the is <dig> primer sequence were found in the wgmm genome  <cit> . this finding implies that is <dig> is not suitable as a general wolbachia a-supergroup marker.

figure 2a and b show that the arm-marker system can be applied to address aforementioned problems arising with wsp and is <dig> primer: sensitivity during pcr is increased significantly and all tested a-supergroup infections are unambiguously detected. wolbachia was traced in all low-titer new world drosophila species  plus the a/o hybrid. in contrast to is <dig>  the arm primer set amplified wolbachia from all three glossina samples . as anticipated, all samples from high-titer wolbachia infections  showed bright bands with arm, whereas wolbachia-uninfected specimens  did not . this argues for a high specificity of the arm primer and against mis-amplification of a random host target rather than the specific symbiont target site.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that the new multicopy wolbachia a-supergroup marker can be used as an ‘ultra-sensitive’ tool to trace low-titer infections by means of classic end-point pcr. first, arm has the advantage of higher sensitivity compared to classic singlecopy wolbachia markers like wsp and thus improves detection limit significantly. particularly, arm-pcr can be easily applied to screen larger numbers of untyped dna specimens, even of low quality arising from long-term storage and/or storage in inappropriate media, from laboratory stocks or samples directly from nature. this is of pivotal interest since classical detection tools might yield false negatives when examining species harboring wolbachia at very low densities, and thereby lead to underestimating natural prevalence of a-supergroup infections. given that 80% of the dipteran infections are supergroup a  <cit> , our new method will significantly facilitate and improve the sensitivity of such surveys. in addition our approach is an advantage over the classic is5-marker, which fails in wolbachia from the tsetse fly glossina. taken together, we show that a wolbachia sequence motif found in multiple copies associated with the vntr loci facilitates reliable wolbachia screening of samples from low-titer infections and might thus serve as a great tool for the wolbachia research community. furthermore a similar approach might be applied to detect other symbionts such as sodalis glossinidius  and the primary symbiont candidatus sodalis pierantonius str. sope of the weevil sitophilus orizae. both symbiont genomes exhibit more than 20% of repetitive dna rendering them appropriate candidates for repeat-based pcr analysis  <cit> . however, we anticipate that such a method reaches its limit when dealing with symbiont genomes, which have become highly streamlined in the course of tight host-symbiont coevolution.
