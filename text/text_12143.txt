BACKGROUND
the dmd gene was the first gene identified by reverse genetics. mutations in the gene cause duchenne  and becker  muscular dystrophies. both the frequency and devastating nature of these conditions make dmd one of the most extensively studied genes among the rare genetic disorders  <cit> .

this intense research has provided molecular tools for the identification of the causative mutation in about 98% of patients, combining mlpa to detect exonic deletions/duplications  and direct sequencing to identify small mutations . nevertheless, some mutations remain unidentified. furthermore it is well known that the large size  of the gene makes it prone to complex rearrangements which are impossible to define precisely using routine molecular diagnostic techniques.

as a consequence, there are a considerable number of dmd/bmd patients in whom no causative mutation has been identified. this impacts on genetic diagnosis, genetic prognosis, clinical confirmation, carrier detection, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling for the families involved.

furthermore, the recent opportunities in terms of innovative therapeutic approaches  <cit>  highlight the relevance for patients and families of obtaining a correct molecular diagnosis, which is required in order to be included in innovative trials. indeed the increased availability of experimental but highly mutation specific therapies, summarised in the concept of "personalised medicine"  <cit> , makes the identification of private mutations in the dmd gene necessary to be eligible for these trials.

in the last few years genome scanning technologies have enabled the detection of previously unrecognised large  copy-number variations  in human dna. while many of these variants do exist as polymorphisms, some of them can change the copy number of critical genes or genomic regions, or alter gene regulation and underlie monogenic disorders, developmental abnormalities and a variety of complex genetic disorders  <cit> .

therefore there is a wide consensus on the potential of array-cgh to determine cnvs for research and clinical purposes, in terms of providing robust and precise measurement of cnvs, scalability and very high resolution  <cit> .

although cgh was initially considered as a strategy for improving cytogenetic resolution by detecting fine chromosome imbalances  <cit> , recently other applications have been envisaged such as cancer studies  <cit> , complex syndromes, mental retardation, mendelian disorders and polygenic traits  <cit> .

the flexibility of cgh arrays is also due to the availability of both commercial and custom arrays, which are designed on demand, therefore it is possible to investigate any region of interest with the appropriate resolution.

dhami et al.  <cit>  designed a single strand pcr-based cgh array in order to detect exon deletions/duplications in a few genes, including dmd.

this strategy demonstrated the ability to identify cnvs, however, in the same way as mlpa and other techniques, it only investigated coding regions.

we have applied the cgh technique in a novel full-gene approach which investigates the presence of cnvs in the entire genomic region of the dmd gene. our custom designed high density-comparative genomic hybridisation array  based on in situ synthesis of  <dig> mer probes with intervals of  <dig> bp, allowed us to obtain a full map of cnvs in the gene, including the non coding regions which have not been investigated previously.

our studies allowed us to validate our array for accurately detecting previously identified rearrangements, to define intronic breakpoints precisely and to identify three pathogenic purely intronic cnvs. we corroborated the cgh studies by rna analysis, therefore validating the significance of the gene imbalances identified. transcription analysis of the full dmd transcript furthermore disclosed three rare splicing mutations due to small intronic changes, missed by the cgh analysis.

RESULTS
dmd-cgh array analysis
we firstly validated the dmd-cgh array both on ten normal control males and on four patients  with mutations previously characterised by mlpa . in patient  <dig>  we detected two non-contiguous duplications, one of  <dig> kb from intron 1p to intron  <dig> and including exon  <dig> and the other of  <dig> kb in intron  <dig> . patient  <dig> showed a deletion of  <dig> bp, from intron  <dig> to exon  <dig> .

we also precisely defined the breakpoint in bmd patient number  <dig>  carrying an out of frame exon 3– <dig> duplication and representing an exception to the rule  <cit> . the dmd cgh array identified a duplication of  <dig> kb from intron  <dig> to nt  <dig> of exon  <dig>  removing its 5'donor splice site consensus sequences .

in patient  <dig>  with a duplication of exons 65– <dig> and a dmd phenotype with associated severe mental retardation, the array allowed us to define the 3' breakpoint within the 3' utr. the mutation consists of a duplication of  <dig> kb ranging from intron  <dig> to  <dig> bp downstream of the dmd stop codon within the 3' utr .

the dmd-cgh allowed us to identify the causative rearrangements in three out of eight dmd patients previously negative for dmd mutations.

we identified a  <dig> kb duplication in intron  <dig> located  <dig> kb upstream of exon  <dig> ; two non-contiguous deletions of  <dig> kb in intron  <dig> and  <dig> kb in intron  <dig> ; and a duplication of  <dig>  kb in intron  <dig> located  <dig> kb from exon  <dig> . in the remaining five patients  no pathogenic cnvs were identified by cgh.

interestingly in all  <dig> patients the dmd-cgh array identified a cnv of  <dig>  kb in intron  <dig> which was deleted in patients  <dig> and  <dig> and duplicated in all the others . examples of deleted and duplicated alleles of the intron  <dig> cnv are reported in figure  <dig> 

cgh analysis of ten normal control males revealed the presence of both deleted and duplicated regions, therefore suggesting this to be a polymorphic cnv .

real time pcr was performed in patients  <dig> and  <dig> while pcr and sequencing were performed in patients  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  validating the duplications and deletions identified with the array .

rna analysis and sequence analysis
patients with pathogenic cnvs identified at the dmd-cgh array analysis
patient  <dig> showed a  <dig> kb duplication in intron  <dig> confirmed by realtime pcr, but no rna was available for analysis to determine whether this variant was pathogenic or not.

dmd-cgh analysis of patient  <dig> revealed two non-contiguous deletions located in intron  <dig> and intron  <dig>  rna analysis showed skipping of exon  <dig> . since no splicing defect was detected on genomic dna using fm-csce analysis this suggested that an inversion could be responsible for the phenotype. based on dmd-cgh results pcr analysis was performed confirming the occurrence of an inversion of the entire region with a deletion of  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb  at the respective inversion breakpoints .

patient  <dig> showed a  <dig>  kb duplication within intron  <dig>  the duplication was confirmed by realtime pcr. rna analysis showed failure to amplify the exon 4– <dig> junction, whereas exons  <dig> to  <dig> and exons  <dig> to  <dig> were correctly spliced. pcr analysis with primers located within the duplicated region coupled with primers in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  failed to detect any product. this behaviour suggests the insertion of a very large intronic region into the transcript between exons  <dig> and  <dig> 

patient  <dig> with bmd and the out-of-frame mlpa exons 3– <dig> genomic duplication showed an in-frame exons 3– <dig> transcript, as expected considering the cgh results  <cit> .

patients negative for pathogenic cnvs at the dmd-cgh array analysis
patient  <dig> showed an insertion of  <dig> bp between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  derived from intron  <dig> . in this patient the sequence of the intron  <dig> specific region showed an a to g transition that lead to the creation of an acceptor splice site . the recognition of a donor splice site  <dig> nucleotides downstream results in the incorporation of the intronic sequence into the mature transcript, causing a frameshift. .

patient  <dig> showed an insertion of  <dig> bp derived from intron  <dig> between exons  <dig> and  <dig> . in this patient an a to g transition in intron  <dig> lead to the creation of a donor splice site . the presence of an acceptor splice site  <dig> nucleotides upstream caused the incorporation of the intronic region into the mature transcript .

patient  <dig> showed an insertion of  <dig> bp derived from intron  <dig> between exons  <dig> and  <dig> . this sequence is normally present within intron  <dig> and flanked by two cryptic splice sites. however a deletion of  <dig> nucleotides immediately upstream of the cryptic acceptor splice site also occurred in this patient, inducing the recognition and incorporation of the abnormal out-of-frame exon into the transcript .

intron  <dig> cnv
rna analysis in both patients  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed a correct amplification of the transcript including exon  <dig> and  <dig>  therefore excluding a splicing abnormality as expected since the same cnv was also found in the  <dig> unaffected males .

all the results of the cgh study are reported in table  <dig>

discussion
the array cgh technique represents an extremely effective tool for the identification of cnvs in the genome with important technical advantages  and relevant diagnostic implications. cgh array has been well validated in a variety of approaches for defining both cytogenetic abnormalities and some mendelian disorders . however, in the latter, non coding regions were never explored  <cit> .

here we describe the results obtained using a novel custom dmd-cgh array covering the full genomic region of the dmd gene, including  <dig> kb upstream and downstream of the 5' and 3' utrs. we made this novel microarray in order to identify all possible quantitative pathogenic changes in the dmd gene as well as elusive deep intronic pathogenic cnvs. the dmd-array was able to accurately identify and refine already known deletions/duplications in the gene. this suggests that the array could be used as a high throughput technique for high scale dmd molecular diagnosis. remarkably it allowed us to define both intronic and untranslated region  breakpoints in all patients studied. it also revealed rare pure intronic mutations which were not detected by routine genomic analysis. notably, we describe a rare dmd gene inversion affecting exon  <dig>  <cit> , the first to be identified by cgh.

as expected, the array failed to identify very small intronic mutations affecting splicing, for which rna profiling was necessary.

among the patients studied, we identified three novel pathogenic cnvs, which are purely intronic. rna analysis allowed us to demonstrate, at least for two of them, that they affect the correct splicing of the dmd gene. the cgh-mediated identification of these rearrangements avoided an extensive rna analysis, often impaired by low/poor quality of the rna obtainable from patients' tissues, in particular when only myod transformed myogenic cells are available.

by our dmd-cgh we also identified a non pathogenic cnv within intron  <dig>  not reported in the cnvs database  <cit> . this was confirmed as a normal variant by transcription analysis and by analysing normal controls.

furthermore three complex rearrangements have been defined in term of both orientation and breakpoint definition, again improving the molecular diagnosis. this for example allowed better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in a bmd patient carrying an exons 3– <dig> out-of-frame duplication. the dmd-cgh array showed that the 3' breakpoint falls within exon  <dig>  providing a genomic basis for the observed splicing behaviour.

the dmd-cgh array may also help to investigate dmd/bmd cases with additional features such as severe mental retardation. cognitive impairment in some dmd patients has been associated with mutations affecting the distal dp <dig> and dp <dig> dystrophin isoforms  <cit> . in our patient with the rare duplication of exons 65– <dig> and mental retardation, we confirmed the role of this distal region in impairing dystrophin-related brain function  <cit> .

furthermore the dmd-cgh array allowed us to reveal that the breakpoint of the large duplication within the 3' utr involves a region containing seven auf <dig> and two hu protein binding motifs. these proteins are well known to be involved in mrna stability  <cit> . it is conceivable that large genomic changes within the 3'utr of the dmd gene may influence the resulting phenotype suggesting that the 3'utr should be routinely investigated to possibly unravel still unknown dmd regulatory mechanisms  <cit> .

considering these results, our dmd array promises to be a useful tool both for dmd pathogenic cnv identification and for refining the genomic configuration not only in patients with unusual mutations but indeed in all patients. in fact, while routine mutation analysis clearly identifies apparently identical deletions in different patients, in reality the intronic breakpoints will almost invariably differ. this might involve motifs that affect gene splicing in different ways  <cit> .

although the advantages of using the dmd-cgh array to identify mutations are clear, rna studies provided additional important information in these patients. in particular rna studies allowed us to determine the significance of the cnvs identified and also to see the effects on splicing of mutations identified by the array. in addition the rna analysis allowed to identify small mutations affecting splicing which had not been detected by the array.

among these, we found three very unusual small deep intronic mutations which would have required extensive intronic sequencing to locate using standard methods. all three were shown to alter the dmd splicing profile. in particular, while the two point mutations creating a novel cryptic splice site may be considered to be easily interpreted in terms of their effect on splicing, the small  <dig> bp deletion within intron  <dig> is quite peculiar. in fact, although the effect of this deletion on the transcript is evident, it is unclear how this novel genomic configuration modifies the splicing machinery.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that this dmd-cgh array is a valuable, cost-effective tool for high throughput dmd molecular diagnosis as well as for definition of elusive dmd gene mutations. we suggest that the cgh genomic analysis should precede rna analysis in order to firstly define the genomic profile.

in addition to the diagnostic implications, the investigation of non-coding regions as possibly implicated in the etiopathogenesis of mutations in dmd but also in other genetic disorders, may disclose findings of interest for basic as well as applied research. finally, the breakpoint definition in large rearrangements, which has always represented an extremely complex task, will considerably improve our understanding of the correlations between genotype and phenotype.
