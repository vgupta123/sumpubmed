BACKGROUND
mitochondrial dysfunction is a common cause of human diseases  <cit> , and thus understanding the regulation of mitochondrial functions is critical. mitochondria do not contain histones  <cit> , and almost all mtdna is unmethylated  <cit> , indicating that mtdna is not epigenetically regulated. however, while mammalian mitochondria are estimated to consist of more than  <dig>  proteins, only  <dig> proteins are encoded by mtdna.

methylation of nuclear dna is a major component of epigenetic system in mammalian cells, and is involved in silencing of gene transcription and maintaining genomic stability  <cit> . hypomethylation of regulatory regions is required to allow expression of genes  <cit> . microarray-based dna methylation analysis revealed the existence of thousands of tissue-dependent and differentially methylated regions  in the mouse and human genomes  <cit> . while the t-dmrs of some genes, such as oct- <dig> and nanog, are hypomethylated only in a few cells  <cit> , the methylation status of most t-dmrs is not specific, but common to certain cells or tissues  <cit> . tissue-dependent methylation status of t-dmrs, including tissue-specific methylation status of t-dmrs, forms a distinctive dna methylation profile for each cell type  <cit> .

a nuclear mt gene, ant <dig>  which encodes mitochondrial outer membrane protein, contains t-dmrs which is specifically hypomethylated in the testis  <cit> . also, few dozens of nuclear mt genes in mice are hypomethylated in the liver relative to the cerebrum  <cit> . however, the presence of t-dmrs in nuclear mt genes has not been comprehensively analyzed; this is necessary for understanding the regulation of mitochondrial functions. in this study, we analyzed the dna methylation of  <dig> nuclear mt genes in the liver, brain, and heart tissues of mouse; these tissues consume large amounts of energy and are highly susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunctions. our results indicated that at least  <dig> nuclear mt genes, which account for 71% of the total investigated nuclear mt genes, contain t-dmrs in their transcription start site  flanking regions , and that the differential methylation status of these t-dmrs is associated with tissue-dependent mitochondrial functions.

RESULTS
identification of t-dmrs in the tss flanking regions of nuclear mt genes in the liver, brain, and heart tissues
to investigate the dna methylation status of nuclear mt genes in the liver, brain , and heart tissues, we conducted pairwise tissue comparisons using model-based analysis of tiling-array  along with d-ream analysis  <cit> . differences in the dna methylation status at hpych4iv sites  were exhibited as differences in matscores of the probes corresponding to the selectively amplified fragments generated by digestion of unmethylated hpych4iv sites  <cit> . we identified tissue-dependent and differentially methylated hpych4iv sites within the  <dig> kb-tss flanking regions of  <dig> refseq genes that are known to encode mitochondrial proteins and are registered in the mitop <dig> database as a reference set  <cit> . in each tissue comparison, hpych4iv sites with matscores above a specific threshold value were identified as hypomethylated t-dmrs in that particular tissue. the lowest matscore of hpych4iv sites whose hypomethylation were confirmed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis  , were considered as the threshold values of matscore. cobra was performed for hpych4iv sites whose matscores were larger than  <dig> when one tissue was compared to the either of the other  <dig> tissues. we identified t-dmrs in the  <dig> kb-tss flanking regions of  <dig> nuclear mt genes , with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nuclear mt genes with t-dmrs specifically hypomethylated in the liver, brain, and heart tissues, respectively, when compared with the other  <dig> tissues  .

most functional categories of mitochondria classified by mitop <dig> were found in nuclear mt genes with t-dmrs and with hypo t-dmrs . overrepresentation and underrepresentation of nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs were found in the detoxification and mitochondrial ribosomal categories, respectively . detoxification is one of the functions of the liver. nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs also included the genes related to liver-specific functions, namely, otc and lrpprc . otc functions in the urea cycle in the liver  <cit> . lrpprc is a binding partner of ppargc1a, and functions in hepatic gluconeogenesis  <cit> . nuclear mt genes with t-dmrs contained a number of genes involved in various types of mitochondrial regulation, such as the regulation of protein sorting, mitochondrial morphology, and translation of mtdna-encoded proteins .

human homologs of mouse nuclear mt genes possessing t-dmrs are related to various human diseases. for example, mutations of lrpprc, ndufs <dig>  and ndufs <dig>  the genes with liver-, brain-, and heart-hypo t-dmrs, respectively, are associated with leigh's disease  <cit> . in addition to mutations, overexpression of some nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs in non-liver tissues are involved in the human diseases. for example, overexpression of acsl <dig> and tgm <dig> are found in the human glioma and brain of huntington's disease and are suggested to be involved in pathogenesis  <cit> .

correlation between the dna methylation status of t-dmrs and nuclear mt gene expression
next, we examined the correlation between the dna methylation status of nuclear mt genes and their expression using microarray data downloaded from gene expression omnibus . the liver-hypo t-dmrs positively correlated with the liver vs. cerebral cortex and liver vs. heart expression ratios . in the brain and heart, only the hypo t-dmrs located downstream of tsss positively correlated with the ratio of the expression in hypomethylated tissue vs. other tissue . on the other hand, negative correlation was observed between the upstream heart-hypo t-dmrs and the heart vs. cerebral cortex expression ratio, although the average expression levels were greater in the heart . thus, the downstream hypo t-dmrs correlated with the expression of the nuclear mt genes in all tissues examined. the correlation between t-dmrs around tsss and tissue-specific gene expression coincided with that in the previous reports  <cit> . we confirmed the tissue-dependent gene expression of otc, acsl <dig>  and ndufs <dig>  the genes carrying downstream hypo t-dmrs for liver, brain, and heart, respectively, by using real-time pcr .

concentration of liver-hypo t-dmrs in the downstream regions of nuclear mt genes
in addition to the highest correlation of downstream liver-hypo t-dmrs with nuclear mt gene expression , a significantly larger proportion of the nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs contained these hypo t-dmrs in their downstream regions as compared to the nuclear mt genes with brain- and heart-hypo t-dmrs . furthermore, in genes with downstream liver-hypo t-dmrs, the nuclear mt genes were highly enriched . liver-hypo t-dmrs were especially enriched within regions of +1~+ <dig> kb of tsss of nuclear mt genes . these results indicate that regulation of nuclear mt genes is especially dependent on dna methylation in the liver.

overrepresented transcriptional regulatory motifs in nuclear mt genes with liver- and brain-hypo t-dmrs
we next investigated whether t-dmrs of nuclear mt genes are associated with any transcriptional regulatory motifs. foxa <dig> is a transcription factor that activates the genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation and the regulation of lipid metabolism, ketogenesis, and insulin sensitivity in the mouse liver  <cit> . we analyzed the enrichment of genes containing foxa2-binding sites within an extended gene region  using known genome-wide foxa2-binding sites in the mouse liver obtained by chip-sequencing  <cit> . we found that the targets of foxa <dig> were enriched  <dig> -fold in nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs relative to all nuclear mt genes . sixty-four out of  <dig> nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs were the targets of foxa <dig> . this is contrast to the previous report, which indicated enrichment of target genes of hnf <dig> and/or hnf <dig> in hypomethylated genes in the mouse liver  <cit> .

we further analyzed the enrichment of specific regulatory motifs in nuclear mt genes with hypo t-dmrs by using the opossum program  <cit> . we used all nuclear mt genes as a background gene set, and analyzed both  <dig> kb upstream and downstream of tsss of the genes with hypo t-dmrs. the enrichment of the genes with foxa2-binding sites in their downstream region was observed in the nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs. . it has been reported that foxa2-binding at distal downstream region of tss of cebpa gene functions as an enhancer in humans  <cit> . hypomethylation of downstream t-dmrs may enhance transcription by permitting transcription factors access to target genes. we also found that genes with nfya-binding sites in their downstream regions were enriched among the nuclear mt genes with liver-hypo t-dmrs, and the genes with cebpa- and stat1-binding sites in their upstream regions were enriched among the nuclear mt genes with brain-hypo t-dmrs . these results indicate that t-dmrs are associated with specific transcription factors in a tissue-dependent manner. cebpa and stat <dig> are reported to be involved in cortical neurogenesis  <cit>  and inflammatory responses in the brain  <cit> , respectively. it has been reported that cebpa-null mice showed decreased nuclear mt gene expression in brown adipose tissue  <cit> . stat <dig> also regulates nuclear mt gene expression in t cells in response to ifn-γ  <cit> . hypomethylation of hypo t-dmrs of targets of these transcription factors may permit transcription factors access to the target genes, and hypermethylation of these t-dmrs may be essential for secured repression of the corresponding genes in other tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
at least 71% of investigated nuclear mt genes contains t-dmrs, and the methylation status of t-dmrs correlated with tissue-dependent expression of dozens of nuclear mt genes. considering that there are at least  <dig> different cell types in the mammalian body, the total number of nuclear mt genes with t-dmrs will be higher. the differences in protein composition of mitochondria are reported to reflect tissue-dependent nuclear mt gene expression  <cit> . our data suggest that dna methylation status of nuclear mt genes underlies tissue-dependent mitochondrial functions.
