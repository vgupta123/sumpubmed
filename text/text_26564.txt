BACKGROUND
vitamin e is the common name that describes eight naturally occurring compounds having tocopherol activity
 <cit> . the eight compounds are lipid-soluble antioxidants with two distinct groups, tocopherols and tocotrienols. the two groups differ in the saturation of the side chain and vary in the number and location of methyl groups
 <cit> , and are classified according to the location of the methyl group: α-tocopherol , β-tocopherol , δ-tocopherol , γ-tocopherol , α-tocotrienol, β-tocotrienol, δ-tocotrienol and γ-tocotrienol
 <cit> . vitamin e plays an important role in plants development and can protect cell membranes from oxidation. vitamin e can prevent oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid by absorbing the superfluous free radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction
 <cit> . this serves to remove the free radical intermediates, thereby preventing continuity of the oxidation reaction. vitamin e can prevent several diseases in humans and other animals, such as cardiovascular disease, alzheimer's disease, neurological disorders, cancer, cataracts, inflammatory diseases and age-related macular degeneration
 <cit> . food and nutrition guidelines recommend  <dig> mg/day of vitamin e for both adults and teenagers
 <cit> . individuals in developed nations can easily fulfill their daily requirement of vitamin e, but vitamin e deficiency  in the developing countries is more common in premature infants and elderly people
 <cit> . furthermore, ved that is not immediately treated can lead to other serious diseases such as muscle weakness, ataxia, blindness, dementia, and eventually spinocerebellar degeneration
 <cit> .

the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway has been well studied in the model plant – arabidopsis 
 <cit> . several enzymes that participate in the biosynthetic pathway have been characterized and annotated in arabidopsis and synechocystis pcc <dig> including 4-hydoxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase 
 <cit> , tocopherol cyclase 
 <cit> , homogentisic acid phytyltrasferase 
 <cit> , 4-benzoquinol methyltransferase 
 <cit> , tocopherol methyltransferase 
 <cit> , and phytol kinase 
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, the first step in the biosynthetic pathway is to form the – homogentisic acid  and phytyldiphosphate . hga can be synthesized from 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate by hppd/pds and pdp can be translated from phytol by vte <dig>  through the function of geranylgeranyl reductase , pdp can also be synthesized from geranylgeranyl diphosphate , which is also a precursor for carotenoid and tocotrienol biosynthesis. the second step in the pathway involves forming the immediate precursor, 2-methyl-6-phytyl- <dig> -benzoqiunol  from hga and pdp through vte2/hpt. third, vte <dig> translates mbpq into  <dig>  3-dimethyl-5-phytyl- <dig> -benzoqiunol , and then converts to γt. the last step involves the formation of different tocopherols using vte <dig> and vte4/γ-tmt enzymes. many of the genes involves in the tocopherol synthesis pathways are similar in different plants and have been cloned in several plants, such as tomato and rice
 <cit> .

in addition to several other quality traits , tocopherol content has been a focus of modern agriculture and several qtls for tocopherol content has been mapped in different plant species
 <cit> . marwede et al.
 <cit>  used a double haploid  population to locate several qtls for γt, αt, tt and α/γ in winter oilseed rape. elsa m and vera-ruiz et al.
 <cit>  performed fine mapping for the tph <dig> gene, which can lead to a sharp reduction in βt in sunflower f <dig> and f <dig> populations. to date, two maize qtl mapping studies of tocopherols have been conducted. wong et al.
 <cit>  mapped several qtls for tocopherols using an f2: <dig> segregating population  and one test-cross population with ae <dig> using  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers, and identified qtls for γt, αt, tt and α/γ on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  chander et al.
 <cit>  identified  <dig> qtls in  <dig> regions covering all chromosomes except chromosome  <dig> by using a recombinant inbred line  population with  <dig> ssr markers. in these studies, the confident interval of identified qtls was > <dig> cm because of the limited number of markers used.

recently, a new genotyping technique, using the third generation marker system with snp markers has been developed
 <cit> . compared with ssr markers, snp markers are an ideal marker system because they are evenly distributed across the genome, are co-dominant, and accurate, and can be generated in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner. in this study, we used a maize goldengate assay containing  <dig> snps to construct high-density linkage maps for two segregating populations with one common parent. the goals of this study were:  to identify qtls affecting tocopherol content by analyzing two segregating populations with one common parent across the whole genome;  to fine map the major qtls using the high-density markers;  and to explore the genetic architecture of tocopherol biosynthesis in different maize genetic backgrounds which could provide valuable information for further research.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation in tocopherols
significant phenotypic variation was observed among the three parent lines in the traits of interest. for both γt and tt, the content was lowest in the common parent k <dig> , followed by ci <dig>  and was highest dan <dig> . the αt content was highest in ci <dig> , followed by the common parent k <dig> , and was lowest in dan <dig>  which contains half the αt level of ci <dig>  in contrast, α/γ ratio was highest in k <dig> , followed by ci <dig>  and was lowest in dan <dig> . the distribution of different tocopherols in the three parents also varied. in k <dig>  the content of γt was just half as that of αt  where as γt content in ci <dig>  was nearly twice as that of αt , even in dan <dig> γt content  was more than ten times as that of αt  in beijing location in  <dig>  and similar trends was also observed in hainan location in  <dig> .

a average of three repeats tocopherols contents of the three parents in  <dig> beijing; b broad-sense heritability of the tocopherols in the two populations; note: the unit for γt, αt, and tt is μg/g, the max contents for each trait were bold type.

for different traits, the level of phenotypic variation varied by several folds  to nearly hundred folds  changes. the mean for γt in pop- <dig> was less than that in pop- <dig>  and the range was also larger in pop- <dig> the similar phenomenon was observed in tt. however the mean value for αt and α/γ in pop- <dig> was higher than that in pop- <dig> and was also consistent with the observed value for the respective parents of each line .

the broad sense heritability  was estimated from the f2: <dig> data and the two corresponding f2: <dig> populations. the heritability for each trait was high but varied for different traits. heritability was highest  for γt in pop- <dig> and lowest  was divulged for αt in pop- <dig> . pearson correlation coefficients for each trait in every generation showed that γt was significantly positively correlated  with the secondary trait-tt but showed little or even no correlated with αt - <dig> ) . the correlation coefficients between the f2: <dig> populations and two f2: <dig> populations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in pop- <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in pop- <dig> .

genetic linkage map
among  <dig> snps,  <dig> markers were polymorphic in pop- <dig> and  <dig> markers in pop- <dig>  after deleting markers that were located in the same position or were unlinked, only  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers were used for linkage map construction . because of the common parent k <dig>  the two maps had many common markers whereas,  <dig> unique markers were used to construct a consensus map following the method of wu et al. 
 <cit> . the pop- <dig> map covered a  <dig> -cm region, smaller than that of pop- <dig>  <dig> -cm region. the average interval distance between two markers was shorter in pop- <dig>  than the pop- <dig> . the integrated map covered a much larger region  than the two separate maps, with  <dig> snp markers and a narrow interval distance of  <dig>  cm .

qtl mapping
after  <dig>  permutation tests, the threshold logarithm of odds  scores were defined as  <dig>  whereas  <dig> qtls were detected in the pop- <dig> f2: <dig> and  <dig> qtls in pop- <dig> f2: <dig> . in the hainan environment, only seven qtls were detected in pop- <dig> f2: <dig> and five in pop- <dig> f2: <dig>  in hubei, ten putative qtls were observed for pop- <dig> and  <dig> for pop- <dig> . seven qtls for each of the pop- <dig> and pop- <dig> populations were detected in at least two environments. the major qtls were confirmed in the three environments for the respective maps. in both maps the total qtls detected were  <dig> and including  <dig> in pop- <dig> and  <dig> in pop- <dig>  most of the detected qtls showed additive effects rather than dominate effects.

note: the effect of the alleles assumes that the favorable allele came from k <dig> 

among the  <dig> qtls in the pop- <dig> f2: <dig>  γt and αt had four each, whereas tt had six and α/γ had three . these qtls were mainly located in  <dig> regions on different chromosomes, with one each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two on chromosome  <dig> and four on chromosome  <dig>  no qtls were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each qtl explained from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of the phenotypic variation. all the qtls explained  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total phenotypic variation for each trait. two qtls with a >  <dig> lod were detected in the pop- <dig> map. the qc5- <dig> was between the markers pza <dig>  and pza <dig>   affecting the content of γt, αt, tt and α/γ it explained  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation for each trait. the other qtl, defined as qc5- <dig> were located between the markers pza <dig>  and phm <dig>  , and affected the content of γt, αt, tt and α/γ; it explained  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for each trait . the k <dig> allele of qc5- <dig> on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> was responsible for decreasing the content of αt, tt and α/γ and for increasing γt. while to qc5- <dig> at the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  the favorable allele was from ci <dig> for γt, αt, tt, and k <dig> for α/γ .

the  <dig> putative qtls in pop- <dig> f2: <dig> were distributed as follows: four , two , four , three  . these qtls were located in five regions on different chromosomes; five qtls each on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  and three qtls on chromosome  <dig>  three regions were on chromosome  <dig>  and one each on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  no qtl was observed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each qtl could explain the phenotypic variation from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % for αt on chromosome  <dig> . all detected qtls could explain  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total variation for each trait. in pop- <dig> the qd1- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> between phm <dig>  and phm <dig>   could explain  <dig> % variation for tt, –whereas qd5- <dig> could explain  <dig> % phenotypic variation for αt . the dan <dig> alleles at qd1- <dig> were associated with increasing γt, αt and tt contents but did not affect α/γ, whereas the qd5- <dig> alleles from k <dig> on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  had increasing  or decreasing  effects.

fine mapping of qd5- <dig> in the pop- <dig> map
to dissect the large qc5-1/qd5- <dig> qtl detected in both maps, the polymorphic markers at the threshold lod near the peak were selected. the qtl contributed  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  of the phenotypic variation for αt in the pop- <dig>  respectively. in pop- <dig> phenotypic variation of  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for αt were observed. the significant effects indicated that the qd5- <dig> qtl could be a qualitative gene and can be fine mapped by analyzing the recombinants among the segregating populations.

the pop- <dig> was first selected to analyze recombination within the qd5- <dig> region because of its wide phenotypic variation for αt. from the initial mapping, the pza <dig>  and pza <dig>  markers were located at either end of the region separately by  <dig> cm genetic distance and  <dig>  mb  physical distances. there were four additional markers within this region . in total, five recombinant combinations were identified, dividing the  <dig> rils  into  <dig> haplotypes . the  <dig> haplotypes could be divided into  <dig> obvious groups based on 09bjf2: <dig> data: group  <dig> for haplotypes iv, v, vi, xiii, and xiv , group  <dig> for haplotypes i, ii, iii, vii, viii and iv  and group  <dig> for the rest haplotypes . similar trends were also observed in the f2: <dig> populations from the other two locations . comparing the phenotypes of type  <dig> , type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  indicated that the parent k <dig> had the favorable allele for αt in the qtl region . the phenotype of group  <dig> was similar to type  <dig>  the group  <dig> was similar with type  <dig> and group  <dig> phenotype was similar with type  <dig>  based on this information, the qtl region was narrowed down between markers pza <dig>  and pza <dig>  to around  <dig>  mb region. there are  <dig> bacterial artificial chromosomes  identified within this target region and included an annotation for the vte <dig> tocopherol biosynthesis gene.

using the same approach, another qtl-qd1- <dig> in pop- <dig>  which explained  <dig> % of γt content, was analyzed. all the families were divided into  <dig> haplotypes and the haplotypes of i, ii, iii. ix, x, xi, and xii had the lowest γt content. consistent with our expectation, the interval could narrowed from  <dig>  cm  to ~ <dig>  cm  in pop- <dig> map .

discussion
the genetic basis for tocopherol biosynthesis in maize grain
in the present study,  <dig> qtls were detected in two f2: <dig> populations, with one to six qtls for each trait. these qtls can explain the phenotypic variation of each trait from  <dig> % for α/γ in pop- <dig> to  <dig> % for tt in pop- <dig>  two major qtls  that affect all four target traits were identified in pop- <dig>  both qc5- <dig> and qc5- <dig> were located on chromosome  <dig> and explained a maximum phenotypic variation of 30% and 25% for αt, respectively . in pop <dig>  the major qtls one  on chromosome  <dig> and the qd5- <dig> qtl on chromosome  <dig> explained 51%  and53%  phenotypic variation respectively . more than 80% of the qtls detected in this study contributed in an additive manner. hence, vitamin e biosynthesis in maize grain may be controlled by several major and a number of minor qtls. this phenomenon is different with other agronomic traits, such as flowering time
 <cit>  and leaf architecture
 <cit> . these traits are controlled by many minor qtls and to data no major qtls have been reported. vitamin e is beneficial for human and animal health, but the absence of a selection index makes it difficult to breed for this trait, which is not as important compared as other economic traits such as yield. this type of trait may not be under strong selection pressure in the breeding and farming community, which is why major qtls were easily identified. with the advent of such major additive qtls the total tocopherols content of maize grains can be easily increased using marker assistant selection , which can be a simple guide for breeders to improve such traits. furthermore, fine mapping of these major qtls will explore the phenomenon in a comprehensive way because only a few candidate genes were detected in each qtl region, which distinguishes this pathway in maize from the extensively studied corresponding one in arabidopsis. hence, the study of tocopherol compounds in maize grains will help to increase the economic and nutritional value of maize crops which could account for more than half of the increased worldwide consumer demand for cereals
 <cit> .

when a qtl with a large effect is identified, determining the causal gene is a tedious and time-consuming task
 <cit> , although the involvement of a few major genes, facilitates the identification and fine mapping of the candidate gene. in addition, a single large-effect qtl often has multiple, closely linked qtls with smaller, and sometimes opposite, effects on the phenotype
 <cit> . the qc5-1/qd5- <dig> qtl has a large effect on the overall phenotype
 <cit> . table 
 <dig> shows some qtls that were identified in previous study
 <cit> . a comparison of the results shows that qd1- <dig> was only in pop- <dig>  which is similar to the previous studies of chromosome 8
 <cit> . the populations used in this study are of different genetic background as compared with those in the previous studies, so the source may be different across the different genetic material. however, our analysis has resulted in better coverage of the maize genome by using a large number of markers to determine more possible qtls playing any kind of major or minor role in this phenomenon.

it is interesting to note that the two candidate genes vte <dig> and hppd- <dig> from the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway were both located within one corresponding qtl region in this study, it suggested that the genetic system controlling the biosynthesis of tocopherol may be more complex in maize as compared with that in arabidopsis. hence, the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway should be explored in more maize populations with different genetic backgrounds. further studies will also help to identify the exact number of qtls with minor or major roles, as a large population size and high number of markers are required to provide a solid basis for further improvement. finally, positional cloning of major qtls is extremely important to validate the results described herein and to improve the overall performance of maize.

regulation of tocopherol synthesis
many biosynthetic genes control the rate of synthesis of tocopherol. nine of the downstream genes have been thoroughly studied in arabidopsis. vte <dig>  vte <dig>  vte <dig>  vte <dig>  vte <dig> and hppd are involved in the formation of the end-product, whereas ggps, dxs, dxr and vte <dig> are involved in synthesis of the tocopherol precursor . maize homologous genes of the first six genes were identified through bioinformatics, with some genes having more than one copy in maize. the physical positions and abbreviated names of the enzyme and chromosome location of these candidate genes are given in b <dig> .

several qtls co-localized with corresponding candidate genes, and just one qtl and candidate gene was found in more than one location . on chromosome  <dig>  vte <dig> were co-located in both maps, whereas hppd- <dig> was found in only one population. the large qtl on chromosome  <dig> in pop- <dig> had no candidate gene, suggesting that the presence of additional unknown genes controlling tocopherol content have not been identified by comparative genomics.

how to mine genes with large qtls in the future
the rapid development of the high-throughput snp genotyping technique enables the easy construction of simple high-density linkage maps. in the present study, the linkage map constructed by snp markers was  <dig>  cm in pop- <dig> and  <dig>  cm in pop- <dig> with an average interval distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively . previously, linkage maps were constructed by ssr markers with an interval distance of 10– <dig> cm in maize and varying distance for different organism
 <cit> . high-density maps more precisely localize major qtls to smaller region.

fine-mapping requires the construction of advanced backcrossing populations and high-density markers to narrow down the qtl region to one gene or even a single snp
 <cit> . fine mapping and functional validation are usually more costly, laborious and time consuming. recently, the rapid development of association mapping has enabled the identification of a single gene within a year of collecting phenotypic and genotypic data. it provides a new tool for analyzing quantitative traits. li et al.
 <cit>  combined traditional fine mapping and association mapping to identify the functional gene fatb and validated the functional sequence variation using in vivo gene expression profiling and in vitro complementation studies. they developed markers based on the predicted gene sequences and increased marker density to narrow down the region of interest, and also performed an association analysis with these markers in  <dig> lines. the combined linkage and association mapping is therefore a beneficial tool for identifying novel genes for different qualitative and quantitative traits
 <cit> .

we performed fine mapping for the large qd5- <dig> and qd1- <dig> by haplotype analysis in an early generation and obtained good results without constructing a large backcross population. this method allowed the large qtl qd5- <dig> region to be narrowed from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, assuming that the recombination occurred in the middle of the markers. there were  <dig> bacs in this region, with vte <dig> – grmzm2g <dig> found in bac <dig> using bioinformatic analysis . recently, vte <dig> was identified as the underlying gene of this qtl using genome-wide and candidate gene association analyses
 <cit> . two functional polymorphisms  were significantly associated with αt. indel <dig> segregates in the parents of the two populations. indel <dig> segregates in k <dig> and dan <dig> populations. hence, ci <dig> has the best haplotype , dan <dig> has the worst haplotype , and the haplotype of k <dig>  is intermediate, which is also consistent with the phenotype of the three parents and qtl effects in the two populations. the cloned gene vte <dig> provides an excellent sample of the high-density markers for qtl fine mapping and cloning.

the size of the qd1- <dig>  qtl diminished from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, and there were  <dig> bacs in the  <dig>  mb region without any known candidate genes . further research is needed to validate the functional site of these qtls. there might be more genes controlling the tocopherol degradation pathway than the genes known to be involved in the synthesis pathway. hence, much more in-depth work is needed for dissecting the metabolic pathway of tocopherols in maize grain including the synthesis and degradation pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified different major qtls in different populations compared with previous studies
 <cit> . thoroughly understanding the genetic architecture of tocopherol biosynthetic and degradation pathway is required to construct more populations with different genetic backgrounds. according to the recent methodology of combining linkage and association mapping
 <cit> , dissecting the tocopherol pathway can be performed in a short period of time with maximum validations, thus providing the scientific community with a base for mas. mas may be a useful and cost-effective tool for improving the nutritional value of the world’s leading cereal. in the preceding decades many major qtls for different traits were applied in breeding programs by developing some functional markers
 <cit> . similarly, the three major qtls in this study  can provide a guide for the development of molecular markers for breeding program or further detailed and deep research.
