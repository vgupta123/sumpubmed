BACKGROUND
inositol pyrophosphates  are densely phosphorylated cellular signals that play pivotal roles in cellular and organismic homeostasis . the pp-insps include 1-pp-insp <dig> , 5-pp-insp , and  <dig> -2-insp <dig> ; these signaling molecules are formed by two groups of kinases, ppip5ks and ip6ks. the 5-kinase activities of the three mammalian isoforms of ip6k  convert insp <dig> and 1-insp <dig> to 5-insp <dig> and insp <dig> . ppip5k <dig> and ppip5k <dig> are 1-kinases that phosphorylate insp <dig> and 5-insp <dig> to 1-insp <dig> and insp <dig> respectively . homologues of these 1-kinases are expressed throughout metazoans, and also in yeasts . the molecular mechanisms of pp-insp action involve their associating with specific “receptors”  <cit> , the antagonism of ptdinsp3-signaling , and direct phosphorylation of proteins  <cit> .

despite the importance of the multifunctional pp-insps in signal transduction, it is striking that little is known of the molecular mechanisms that might control ppip5k and ip6k activities. one recurring mechanism for regulating the signaling functions of kinases comes from cellular control of their access to certain areas of the cell. moreover, in the specific case of pp-insps - no other molecules found in nature contain such highly-concentrated, three-dimensional phosphate arrays - it has been proposed that determining mechanisms of compartmentation of the synthesis of a particular pp-insp is key to understanding how each of them may exert a specific function  <cit> . for example, pp-insps are so highly-charged that their non-specific  electrostatic interactions with proteins may have hindered the evolution of receptor-specificity for a particular pp-insp, unless it can be compartmentalized  <cit> . localized synthesis of an individual pp-insp could also help prevent the less phosphorylated but more abundant insp <dig> from competing with binding of that pp-insp to its receptors  <cit> .

the hppip5k <dig> offers an example of stimulus-dependent compartmentation of pp-insp turnover. this kinase translocates from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in response to activation of ptdinsp <dig> synthesis  <cit> . the ensuing, tightly localized catalytic activity of hppip5k <dig> may be a vital mechanism of coincidence detection during activation of ptdinsp3-signaling cascades  <cit> . in the current study we provide new data that show how hppip5k <dig> exhibits a different mode of compartmentalization.

the amino acid sequence of hppip5k <dig> contains a candidate monopartite nuclear localization signal : a tri- or tetra-peptide comprising lys and/or arg residues . this sequence resides within an rrrrr pentapeptide positioned near the c-terminus of hppip5k <dig> . homologues of this isoform that also possess this candidate nls are distributed throughout much of the animal kingdom . furthermore, in each case the penta-arg lies within a 63-residue sequence that is also highly conserved . neither this sequence, nor the penta-arg, are conserved in either ppip5k <dig> , nor in any yeast or invertebrate ppip5ks annotated to date. no previous study has addressed whether this ppip5k2-specific nls might have any functional significance. the investigation of this possibility has been the main objective of the current study.fig.  <dig> ppip5k <dig> but not ppip5k <dig> contains a candidate nuclear localization sequence in a highly-conserved context. in panel a, clustalw was used to generate an alignment of human ppip5k <dig>  with homologues from the mouse, mus musculus ; big brown bat, eptesicus fuscus ; chicken, gallus gallus ; frog, xenopus tropicalis . the candidate nuclear localization sequence  is boxed. related amino-acids are grouped into classes - a/g, d/e, f/y, i/l/v/m, n/q and s/t - and then color coded based upon their relative prevalence at each position . where two groups of amino acids are equally prevalent, priority defaults to alphabetical order. using these same amino-acid classes, panel b depicts the percentage similarities of aligned regions of hppip5k <dig> and hppip5k <dig> ; the proteins can be divided into regions that are either >85% similar  or no more than 30% similar . the graphics also depict the kinase domains and the pbd p3-binding domains  <cit> ) that are present in both hppip5k <dig> and hppip5k <dig>  the position of the 63-residue domain in hppip5k <dig> that contains penta-arginine  is also indicated; note how it is more conserved than the regions immediately flanking it. ppip5k <dig> does not contain sequence that is homologous to the cpa domain, and so is also missing both the penta-arg nls and the adjacent ser residue that is phosphorylated 



we initially used confocal microscopy to study the subcellular distribution of gfp-tagged ppip5k constructs in hek293t cells. these experiments demonstrated the existence of a discrete nuclear hppip5k <dig> pool, although its size was relatively small and somewhat variable . it was therefore necessary to study this subcellular compartmentation in a statistically-powerful large number of cells, in an automated manner that eliminates bias in cell selection by the investigator. two techniques have been used previously for these types of experiments: microscope-based high-content automated image analysis  <cit>  and imaging flow cytometry  <cit> . these methods also have the benefit of being insensitive to variability in both cell morphology and fluorescence intensity . imaging flow cytometry has the faster throughput, and that is the technique we have employed here. we also used site-directed mutagenesis to establish that the penta-arg sequence in hppip5k <dig> contributes to the protein’s degree of nuclear localization. furthermore, mass-spectrometry data and additional mutagenic experiments provided evidence that the functionality of the penta-arg is influenced by phosphorylation of an adjacent ser residue. as such, our study provides the first indication that covalent modification of any ppip5k can alter any aspect of its biological function. overall, our work offers several new directions for pp-insp research.

methods
cell lines and constructs
hek293t cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with  <dig> % fbs at 37 °c in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere. gateway cloning was used to prepare expression vectors for tagged versions of hppip5k <dig>  <cit> : pdest47/hppip5k <dig> , and pdest515/hppip5k <dig> . mutations were introduced using pcr site-directed mutagenesis .

mass spectrometry
neomycin-selected  stable hek293t cell lines expressing either flag-hppip5k <dig> or flag-β-galactosidase were plated at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/60 mm dish in dmem containing  <dig> % fbs. after two days, cells were lysed in ice-cold  <dig>  ml buffer containing 50 mm hepes, ph  <dig> , 300 mm nacl,  <dig> % np- <dig>  10 mm mgso <dig>  10% glycerol, 10 mm naf, 1 mm na3vo <dig>  protease inhibitor tablets ). lysates were cleared by centrifugation and then incubated at 0–4 °c with  <dig>  volume of anti-flag® m <dig> affinity gel  pre-equilibrated with tbs . after 90 min, the resin was centrifuged, washed three times with ice-cold tbs, and bound proteins were eluted with  <dig>  volume of  <dig>  m glycine-hcl . proteins were resolved by sds-page . for study of hppip5k <dig> binding partners, the entire gel lanes were divided into  <dig> equal sections, each of which were then digested, lyophilized, and resuspended in 40 μl of  <dig> % formic acid, prior to analysis. for phosphopeptide analysis of ppip5k <dig>  the kinase band was excised manually and digested with trypsin  for 8 h in a progest robotic digester . resulting peptides were lyophilized, resuspended in 35 μl of  <dig> % formic acid, and enriched using tio <dig> tips  following the manufacturer’s protocol.

samples were analyzed by nanolc-esi-ms and ms/ms, using an agilent  <dig> nanolc system on-line with an agilent  <dig> ion trap mass spectrometer with the chip cube interface, essentially as described  <cit> . the data extractor feature of the spectrum mill software  was used to generate peak lists from mass spectroscopy based analysis of peptide digests. a peak list was generated from the data obtained from the nanolc-esi-ms/ms analysis using the data extractor feature of the spectrum mill software from agilent or the mascot distiller software from matrix science. the data extractor settings included limiting the data search to deconvolved ions observed between  <dig> and 5000 da and a retention time between 10 min and 50 min. ms scans with the same precursor mass  and retention time within 30 s were merged. moreover, of the remaining ms/ms spectra, only those that contained sequence tag information greater than  <dig> residues were submitted for database searching. the resulting extracted data were then searched against the ncbi or swissprot/uniprot human databases using the ms/ms search function in the spectrum mill software or the mascot search engine from matrix science. search settings included a trypsin specificity with one missed cleavage allowed, a precursor ion mass tolerance of 2 da, a product ion mass tolerance of  <dig>  da, variable methionine oxidation, and a minimum matched spectral intensity of 70%.

confocal microscopy
cells were seeded in eight-well chambered coverglass  for 15 h, and then transiently transfected with  <dig>  ug of dna plasmids using lipofectamine  <dig> . after 48 h, the dmem was replaced with leibovitz’s l- <dig> medium . images were acquired using a zeiss lsm  <dig> inverted microscope equipped with a plan-neofluar  <dig> octovar oil objective. a keypton/argon laser was used for excitation of gfp . all images were analysed using image j software . to quantify fluorescence intensity of ppip5k-gfp in the nucleus relative to the cytosol, we measured and averaged fluorescence intensity in 1 pixel areas from three different positions in each compartment. after subtracting background fluorescence intensity, we determined the ratio of fluorescence in the nucleus  compared to that in the cytosol . the nucleus was identified by hoechst  <dig> staining .

imaging flow cytometry
transient transfections were performed in 6- or 12-well plates  using either polyjet , or fugene  <dig> . cells were analyzed 2 days after transfection. for live-cell imaging, cells were harvested into dmem and washed twice by centrifugation , the second time through a falcon™ tube with 35 μm mesh cell strainer cap ; cells were maintained at 37 °c prior to analysis. in other experiments, < 90 min after harvesting, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline  containing 1% para-formaldehyde , rinsed, and suspended in 120–250 μl pbs prior to analysis. cell nuclei were stained with 50 μm draq <dig>  immediately prior to analysis.

cell data was acquired at 40x magnification  on a single camera, 6-channel imagestreamx flow cytometer  using inspire data acquisition software with 488 nm and 658 nm excitation lasers. brightfield was collected in channel  <dig>  side-scatter was collected in channel  <dig> with a 785 nm laser. gfp and draq <dig> were detected in channel  <dig>  and channel  <dig>  respectively. cell classifier was set for a brightfield area lower limit of 50 μm to eliminate debris. post-acquisition data were analyzed with the nuclear translocation wizard in the ideas  <dig>  software . individual cells were initially gated by best focus in the draq <dig> channel, using a gradient root mean square histogram. single cells were then gated from a plot of brightfield area versus aspect ratio . double positive cells were gated from the intensity of channel  <dig> versus intensity of channel  <dig> dot plot. the degree of cross-correlation of the gfp and draq <dig> signals was determined using the similarity score  within the ideas analysis software on a per-cell basis  <cit> . each experiment was performed at least three times.

RESULTS
evidence for the functionality of the nls in hppip5k2
there are two isoforms of mammalian ppip5k, types  <dig> and  <dig> ; a candidate penta-arg nls is specific to hppip5k <dig> . as a first step towards testing the functionality of the putative nls, we used confocal fluorescence microscopy to compare the intracellular distribution of hppip5k1-gfp and hppip5k2-gfp in live hek293t cells . we used gfp-tagged constructs because we did not have access to specific antibodies that can be used for imaging endogenous protein. we determined the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the nucleus  compared to that in the cytosol . the value of the fn/fc ratio for hppip5k <dig> is  <dig>  , which indicates that this protein is near-completely excluded from the nucleus. similar data were obtained in an earlier study  <cit> . in contrast, a substantially higher fn/fc ratio of  <dig>  was obtained for hppip5k <dig> . these data identify an isoform-specific nuclear pool of hppip5k <dig>  although it is worth noting the extent of the cell-to-cell variability: the data in fig. 2b were acquired from  <dig> cells in which the fn/fc ratios varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> .fig  <dig> identification of a nuclear pool of hppip5k <dig>  panel a shows confocal microscopy of live hek293t cells transfected with either gfp alone, hppip5k1-gfp, or hppip5k2-gfp. single cells are shown that were selected by-eye to represent approximate median values for the distribution of gfp-signal between nucleus  and cytoplasm . from each group, fifteen cells were randomly selected and fn/fc ratios were calculated . data shown are means ± sem . the size bar represents 10 μm



nlss interact with α/β-importin complexes that shuttle many nuclear proteins into the nucleus immediately after their translation  <cit> . other proteins - particularly those that participate in cell signaling - may not have a predominantly nuclear localization by default, but instead have their nuclear delivery regulated by certain β-importins that act independently of α-importin  <cit> . thus, the identification of importins that associate with novel cargoes can be functionally illuminating  <cit> . we searched for importins that might associate with hppip5k <dig> by using a subtractive proteomic approach: either flag-tagged hppip5k <dig>  or an epitope control, flag-tagged β-galactosidase, were stably expressed in hek293t cells. lysates were prepared, and incubated with immobilized anti-flag antibodies to pull-down the respective baits and associated proteins , which were then identified by mass-spectrometry . importin- <dig> was identified in  <dig> spectra from  <dig> unique peptides yielding  <dig> % sequence coverage . importin- <dig> was identified by  <dig> spectra from  <dig> unique peptides with  <dig> % sequence coverage . neither of these importins were identified in the control pull-downs with flag-galactosidase. importin- <dig> and importin- <dig> are members of the β-importin family that are receiving increasing attention for regulating nuclear delivery of certain signaling proteins  <cit> . these data are consistent with the conclusion  that hppip5k <dig> has some capacity to undergo nuclear translocation.fig.  <dig> use of affinity pull-downs and mass spectroscopy to identify importin- <dig> and importin- <dig> as proteins interacting with hppip5k <dig>  panel a shows sds-page analysis of pull-downs of flag-beta-galactosidase  and flag-hppip5k <dig> , with molecular weight markers ; see the methods section for further details. the entire gel lanes  were divided into  <dig> equal sections, each of which were then digested, lyophilized, and resuspended in 40 μl of  <dig> % formic acid, prior to analysis. panel b shows that importin- <dig> was identified in  <dig> spectra from  <dig> unique peptides  and a distinct summed ms/ms search score of  <dig> , yielding  <dig> % sequence coverage. panel c shows that importin- <dig> was identified by  <dig> spectra from  <dig> unique peptides  and a distinct summed ms/ms search score of  <dig>  with  <dig> % sequence coverage. the individual spectra are provided in additional file 2: figures s <dig> and s2



mutagenesis of the nls in hppip5k <dig> inhibits its nuclear translocation
we next investigated if the degree of nuclear localization of hppip5k <dig> would be inhibited by site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme’s putative nls. faced with the challenge that the nuclear pool of hppip5k <dig> is relatively small and variable , we considered it imperative to collect data from a statistically-powerful large number of cells, in an automated manner that eliminates bias in cell selection by the investigator. imaging flow cytometry is a technique that can meet these requirements .

as an alternative to using fn/fc ratios to quantify relative nuclear localization of a protein , imaging flow cytometry performs an alternative but widely-used analytical method: co-localization analysis. here, a specific region of the cell is digitally isolated - “masked” - and then a pixel-by-pixel determination is made of the degree of correlation between two spectrally distinct signals in that particular region of interest. so, for example, the degree of co-localization of a gfp-tagged protein and a draq <dig> nuclear stain, tallies with the extent of nuclear accumulation of that particular protein. pearson’s correlation coefficient has been used frequently to quantify the degree of co-localization between two spectral signals  <cit> . more recently  <cit> , a log transformation of pearson’s correlation coefficient - the similarity score - was introduced. the latter has a wider dynamic range that correlates more closely to qualitative judgments of visual distinctiveness  <cit> .

we used imaging flow cytometry to quantify the degree of co-localization of hppip5k2-gfp and draq <dig> in individual hek293t cells. the similarity scores were calculated from an analysis of each of the approximately  <dig> individual pixels covering every nucleus . in a representative experiment with  <dig> live cells, the population of similarity scores were distributed normally, as expected for a biological phenomenon. thus, the scores from approximately 2/ <dig> of all cells were within one standard deviation of the mean . the median value of the similarity score of this is cell population was  <dig>  . a score > <dig>  designates co-localization of two spectral signals  <cit> ; this criterion was met by 72% of all of the cells that contributed to the data described in fig. 4a. thus, the data obtained by imaging flow cytometry  provide statistically robust confirmation of the conclusion drawn from confocal imaging  that cells contain a distinct nuclear pool of hppip5k <dig> fig.  <dig> analysis by imaging flow cytometry of the degree of nuclear localization of hppip5k2-gfp and hppip5k2nls-3a-gfp. live hek293t cells, transfected with either a, hppip5k2-gfp  or b, hppip5k2nls-3a-gfp , and treated with the nuclear draq <dig> stain, were analyzed for the degree of co-localization of the two spectral signals in every nuclear pixel , using imaging flow cytometry. the histograms depict the frequency of binned similarity-scores  <cit> ; best-fit gaussian plots are added. the horizontal arrows highlight the percentage of cells in which the expressed hppip5k <dig> construct was determined to have a significant nuclear localization . the median value  of the similarity score for cells expressing hppip5k2nls-3a-gfp is significantly lower than that for cells expressing wt enzyme 



we next tested the functionality of the putative nls by creating a construct , in which the penta-arg sequence  was mutated to raaar. in hek293t cells expressing hppip5knls-3a-gfp, the median value for the similarity score was  <dig>  . since the similarity score is a logarithmic function, our data indicate that the nls mutant exhibits  <dig> -fold less nuclear co-localization with draq <dig> than did the wt hppip5k2-gfp . these data provide the first direct demonstration of the functionality of this nls. note that 30% of cells expressing hppip5knls-3a-gfp exhibited some residual nuclear co-localization with draq <dig> . thus, even though our data indicate that the canonical nls makes a major contribution to the extent of nuclear localization of hppip5k <dig>  we do not exclude that other factors may also be involved.

the mean values of total cellular fluorescence of the hppip5k2-gfp and hppip5k2nls-3a-gfp cell populations were very similar , indicating comparable levels of construct expression . nevertheless we also investigated, on a cell-by-cell basis, whether the total cellular fluorescence exhibited any correlation with the similarity score for nuclear localization . the values of the correlation coefficients for this comparison are close to zero . that is, we make the important observation that the degree of nuclear localization of the kinase was not influenced by variations in its overall degree of expression.fig.  <dig> the degree of nuclear localization of hppip5k2-gfp is independent of its degree of expression. either  live, or  fixed, hek293t cells that had been transfected with hppip5k2-gfp were treated with the nuclear draq <dig> stain. the scatter plots show the total gfp fluorescence in each individual cell plotted against the same cell’s similarity score. the values of the correlation coefficients  are shown in each panel



nuclear localization of hppip5k <dig> is regulated by phosphorylation of s1006
there are a number of examples of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of proteins regulating their trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> . for example, the addition of a negatively charged phosphate group close to an nls can interfere with its electrostatic interactions with importins  <cit> . in the case of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein  <cit> , the function of its monpartite nls is inhibited upon phosphorylation of a proximal ser residue . a conserved ser residue  is present immediately c-terminal of the nls in hppip5k <dig> . we therefore investigated if this ser might be phosphorylated and impact the nuclear localization of hppip5k <dig>  the flag-tagged ppip5k <dig> that we expressed in hek293t cells , was pulled-down using anti-flag beads, purified by gel electrophoresis, and then interrogated for phosphorylated residues by nanolc-esi-ms and ms/ms. this approach identified phospho-ser at position  <dig> .fig.  <dig> identification of phospho-s <dig> in hppip5k <dig> by mass spectroscopy. tandem ms spectrum of a doubly charged ion at m/z  <dig>  corresponding to the phosphorylated form of the hppip5k <dig> peptide spanning residues 1006– <dig> . extensive b- and y-ion series unambiguously identify this peptide and also localize the site of phosphorylation to the n-terminus of the peptide at s1006



we interrogated the sequence around s <dig> using phosphomotif  <cit> , to search for consensus motifs that might give clues as to the identity of the protein kinase responsible for phosphorylation of this residue. however, the penta-arg sequence immediately n-terminal of s <dig> satisfies the consensus for at least ten different protein kinases. additional research is therefore required in order to establish which physiological conditions might lead to modification of the degree of phosphorylation of s <dig> 

we used a mutagenic approach to investigate whether the phosphorylation status of s <dig> impacts nuclear localization . for illustrative purposes, we also added to these experiments an analysis by traditional confocal microscopy. the small number of cells analyzed  make these qualitative rather that quantitative observations. nevertheless, these data show that the hppip5k2nls-3a mutant exhibited significantly less nuclear localization than did wild-type enzyme. we also analyzed the distribution of a hppip5k2s1006a mutant in which s <dig> was rendered non-phosphorylatable; this mutant showed a significantly higher degree of nuclear localization than did wild-type enzyme . such data indicate that the phosphorylation of s <dig> that we have observed  normally restricts the degree of translocation of hppip5k into the nucleus. nevertheless, as described above, a far more rigorous analysis can be accomplished by acquiring data from a large number of cells, in an automated manner that eliminates the possibility of investigator bias. we therefore quantified the nuclear localization of these mutants by similarity scores, obtained by imaging flow cytometry. we used fixed cells to facilitate larger sample sets.fig.  <dig> the effects of mutating either the nls or the adjacent s <dig> upon the degree of nuclear localization of hppip5k <dig>  panel a shows western analysis of extracts of hek293t cells in which various hppip5k2-gfp constructs were expressed. for clarity, only four of the molecular markers are labeled. each of the lanes transfected with a hppip5k-gfp construct showed a faint immunoreactive band that corresponded to the migration of gfp alone. imagej analysis indicated this represented <2% of the total signal, which is too small to compromise any of our conclusions. panel b shows representative images of live hek293t cells that expressed each of the various constructs. the size bar represents 10 μm. from each group, fifteen cells were randomly selected and fn / fc ratios were calculated ; data represent means ± sem , determined using student's t-test). imaging flow cytometry was also used to analyze fixed and draq <dig> stained hek293t cells that were transfected with either d, hppip5k2-gfp ; e, hppip5k2nls-3a-gfp ; f, hppip5k2s1006a-gfp ; g, hppip5k2s1006d-gfp . the histograms depict the frequency of binned. similarity scores denoting the degree of co-localization of the gfp signal and nuclear stain, derived on a cell-by-cell basis. best-fit gaussian plots are also shown. the blue gaussian plot for hppip5k2-gfp is superimposed upon the other plots for comparative purposes. statistical differences in median similarity scores  compared to hppip5k2-gfp were determined using a mann–whitney rank sum test. note that the western analysis includes an extract from cells transfected with a hppip5k2s1006e-gfp construct. the similarity score of the latter  was not significantly different from that of hppip5k2s1006d-gfp



in a representative experiment, the median similarity score for the hppip5k2nls-3a mutant  was confirmed to be significantly lower  than that for wild-type enzyme  . the hppip5k2s1006a mutant  exhibited a highly significant  increase in the median value of the similarity score . these data indicate a 58% higher degree of nuclear localization of hppip5k2s1006a compared to wt enzyme, since the similarity score is a logarithmic function. these data provide a quantitatively reliable context to the qualitative observations described in fig. 7b,c. as such, the data obtained by imaging flow cytometry validate our novel conclusion that phosphorylation of s <dig> limits translocation of hppip5k into the nucleus. the specificity of this effect of the s1006a mutation is supported by further experiments in which it did not alter the similarity score in the hppip5k2nls-3a background, in which the nls itself is rendered non-functional . thus, the entry of hppip5k <dig> into the nucleus that we have observed is a regulated event, rather than a non-specific phenomenon. overall, our data provide the first indication that covalent modification of any ppip5k can alter its biological function.fig.  <dig> comparison of the degree of nuclear localization of hppip5k2nls-3a-gfp and hppip5k2nls-3a/s1006a-gfp. shown is an analysis by imaging flow cytometry of hek293t cells that were transfected with either a, hppip5k2nls-3a-gfp  or b hppip5k2nls-3a/s1006a-gfp , and then stained with draq <dig>  the histograms depict the frequency of binned. similarity scores denoting the degree of co-localization of the gfp signal and nuclear stain, derived on a cell-by-cell basis. best-fit gaussian plots are also shown



we also constructed a s1006d phosphomimetic mutant of hppip5k <dig>  compared to wt kinase, the hppip5ks1006d mutant exhibited a highly significant  decrease in its similarity score, indicative of a 40% reduction in its degree of nuclear localization . a similar trend was observed in a much smaller number of cells analyzed by traditional confocal microscopy, although in this case the difference from wt enzyme did not attain statistical significance . these data underscore the biological value of analyzing a large number of cells, in an unbiased and automated manner, when studying the regulation of a sub-pool of a cellular protein.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study describes for the first time a functional nls in the conserved ppip5k <dig> family. we have further demonstrated that, in the case of hppip5k <dig>  there is phosphorylation of a ser residue that is proximal to the nls. the addition of a negatively charged phosphate group close to an nls can interfere with its electrostatic interactions with importins  <cit> . by mutagenesis of this ser residue, we obtained evidence that its phosphorylation reduces the degree of nuclear localization of this kinase. our new data advance our insight into compartmentation of pp-insp synthesis, and also provide the first indication that covalent modification of a ppip5k may regulate its function.

there has been limited insight into consensus sequences for functional nlss, and phosphorylation events that regulate nls function  <cit> . thus, there is a continuing need to experimentally resolve the amino-acid residues that define both nuclear trafficking and its regulation. our accomplishments should contribute to improving the overall predictive reliability of nls algorithms.
