BACKGROUND
cancer development is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is in part due to expression alteration of genes which regulate cell growth and differentiation, such as the improper over-expression of oncogenes, or the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes  <cit> . comparative analysis of expression alterations between tumor and matched normal samples in each individual cancer type has identified many transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators associated with carcinogenesis  <cit> . for instance, compared to normal mucosa, transcription factor  nrf <dig> was found over-expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . using transcriptional data of  <dig> adenomas and paired samples of normal mucosa, the transcription-regulating network of colorectal adenomas is characterized by significantly altered expression of over  <dig> tf genes  <cit> . compared to tfs, expression alteration of rna-binding proteins , master regulators at the post-transcriptional level, was less studied but deregulated transcriptions of several rbps also have been reported to play a critical role in human cancers  <cit> . for example, qki was frequently down-regulated in lung cancer, and qki- <dig> inhibited the proliferation and transformation of lung cancer cells  <cit> . transcription profiling analysis of rbps uncovered their aberrant function associated with prostate adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma as well  <cit> . additionally, aberrant expression of micrornas  and long non-coding rnas'  also led to cancer development  <cit> . however, common and specific patterns altered across different cancer types, especially the contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, are rarely known.

large-scale genomics projects, such as the cancer genome atlas , provided various omics data for thousands of tumors with matched normal samples, including genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomics and proteomics data  <cit> , which gave us a great opportunity to perform pan-cancer studies for understanding the common and specific profiles across multiple cancer types. recently, landscapes of somatic mutation, copy number alterations and oncogenic signatures across major cancer types have been studied  <cit> , as well as microrna-target interaction and functional proteomics data analysis  <cit> . however, as far as we know, comparative analysis of expression alterations of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators across cancer types has never been explored.

in this study, we characterized the expression perturbation of tfs, rbps, lncrnas, cancer related genes  and other genes on  <dig> matched tumor and normal tissue pairs across  <dig> cancer types. we first analyzed the differential expression between matched tumor and normal for each type of gene sets across all studied cancer types, and compared their amplitude of alterations. then we integrated genetic and epigenetic data and protein-protein interaction network  to explain the upstream cause and downstream effect of dysregulated transcription. finally we compared expression changes of tissue-specific genes with non-specific ones and investigated the consistent pathway changes across different cancer types.

RESULTS
expression alteration of rbps contributes to cancer development
thousands of differentially expressed genes were detected in each individual cancer type. the number of tfs, rbps, lncrnas, cancer related genes , as well as other genes whose expressions were significantly changed was shown in table  <dig>  as we expected, allonco were enriched in the differently expressed genes across all cancer types , which was supported by many previous reports  <cit> . mutations in cosmic with frameshift, germline and missense mutations were also significantly changed across most cancer types, while those with large deletions, translocations and splicing mutations were not   <cit> .

surprisingly, rbps were significantly changed in  <dig> of the  <dig> cancer types. marginal significance was observed in prad  and hnsc , while highly statistical significance was detected in coadread, luad and lusc  . consistent expression alterations of rbps across different cancer types suggested that they play an important role in carcinogenesis. compared to rbps, tfs only showed marginally significant enrichment in hnsc, possibly due to the fact that the activity changes of tf are at the protein level which cannot be reflected at the transcription level . lncrnas were significantly depleted across all cancer types , which are possibly biased because only  <dig> of  <dig> lncrnas were included in the standardized mrna-seq data in firehose . additionally the expression level of lncrnas is especially low compared to other regulation factors  <cit> .

to further analysis to which extent expression levels were altered in tumor vs. normal, we compared the amplitude of alterations between tfs, rbps, lncrnas and allonco across cancer types. similar patterns were observed across all cancer types , where cancer-related genes changed most and rbps had the smallest alterations. since rbps and cancer-related genes were both significantly changed across most cancer types, we tried to explore the potential relationships between them. as a result, we found the occurrence of differentially expressed genes and cancer-related genes in the interacting proteins of the rbp of interest. among the top  <dig> rbps changed mostly in tumor compared to normal tissue in lusc, puf <dig>  dhx <dig>  fip1l <dig> and polr2b were identified that both differentially expressed genes and allonco were enriched in their directly interacting targets . puf <dig>  nop <dig> and pabpc <dig> were also identified in luad . it is known that puf <dig> involved in apoptosis and transcription regulation and isoform  <dig> may contribute to tumor progression by enabling increased myc expression and greater resistance to apoptosis in tumors than in normal cells  <cit> . moreover, there were  <dig> allonco genes  that interacted directly with puf <dig> and were also differentially expressed in both luad and lusc . bard <dig> acts as tumor suppressors, and plays a central role in the control of the cell cycle and death  and regulates cell division  <cit> . zhang yq et al. reported that one isoform of bard <dig> was specifically upregulated in tumors of non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . igf2bp <dig>  erg, fubp <dig> and fhl <dig> were also reported being over-expressed/ de-expressed in cancer  <cit> . these results revealed that expression alteration of rbps might spread their effect to allonco, which drives the cancer development.

to explore the upstream regulators that changed the rbps expression, we first compared the correlations of dna copy number alterations with expression changes between differentially expressed rbps and non-differentially expressed rbps. the correlation was represented as r <dig> to see the extent to which the variation in rbp expression can be explained by dna copy number alterations at the rbp locus. as aforementioned, rbps were remarkably enriched in differentially expressed genes in coad, luad and lusc. here the results showed that these differentially expressed rbps had a higher r <dig> than non-differentially expressed rbps in all these three cancer types  we also studied the effect of dna copy number alteration for other  <dig> studied cancer types and no significance was observed . we then analyzed the influence of dna methylation on rbp expression alterations using similar statistical methods, and results showed that dna methylation changes were not significantly associated with rbp expression alterations . these results suggested that the aberrant expression of rbps was caused by genetic alterations rather than epigenetic alterations.

tissue-specific genes lost function in tumor
it is known that some genes are overexpressed in one or several tissues  <cit> , and these tissue-specific genes are highly correlated with tissue-specific diseases  <cit> . we sought to better understand the role of tissue-specific genes in pan-cancer. we investigated the profile of  <dig> specific genes for  <dig> tissues from pagenbase   <cit> , and compared their expression in tumor with that in normal. we observed that tissue-specific genes were more likely to be significantly changed in their corresponding cancer type except prostate-specific genes . for instance, kidney-specific genes were significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes of kirc  and lung-specific genes showed enrichment in differentially expressed genes for both luad and lusc . however, prostate-specific genes didn't show significance in prad, which might be due to the reason that most of the prad data were collected from patients in the late stage. furthermore, most tissue-specific genes were under-expressed in tumor vs. normal across all cancer types except for prad . these results suggested tissue-specific genes generally lost their function in cancer and that defects of tissue-specific genes leads to cancer pathology.

functional similarity across different cancer types
pathways play key roles in genomic studies, and facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms behind specific cancers  <cit> . we estimated the similarity of cancer types not only based on all differentially expressed genes, but also based on the expression alterations of cancer-related pathways from kegg  <cit> , including pathways in cancer, cell cycle and the p <dig> signaling pathway . as we expected, luad and lusc were clustered together in all kinds of clustering, illustrating their close relationship. surprisingly, brca, lihc, luad and lusc clustered together in the cell cycle pathway, indicating the cell cycle are disrupted similarly in these cancer types  <cit> . meanwhile, hnsc and coadread were more close to each other in the p <dig> signaling pathway, which can be explained by the similar regulation role of p <dig> on these two types of cancer  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
dysregulated transcription of rbps plays an important role in cancer development. the aberrant expression of rbps is caused by genetic alterations and spreads their effect to cancer-related genes. in addition, disruption of tissue-specific genes contributes to the corresponding cancer pathology.

methods and materials
genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomics data for  <dig> cancer types
the mrna-seq data of  <dig> matched tumor and adjacent normal samples for  <dig> cancer types, the copy number alterations, and the dna methylation data were downloaded from firehose developed by the broad gdac . the nine cancer types are brca , coadread , hnsc , luad , kirc , lihc , lusc , thca  and prad . there are  <dig> paired samples for brca,  <dig> for coadread,  <dig> for hnsc,  <dig> for kirc,  <dig> for luad,  <dig> pairs for thca and  <dig> for each type of lusc, lihc and prad, respectively.

different gene sets
 <dig> tfs were collected from transfac  <cit> , and  <dig> experimentally characterized rbps were obtained from a recent publication dissecting transcriptional profiles of rna-binding protein in cancer  <cit> . over  <dig>  lncrnas were downloaded from genecode  <cit> , but only  <dig> of these were included in mrna-seq data from the broad gdac standardized data packages. a comprehensive list of  <dig> cancer related genes , which is a non-redundant union of  <dig> studies  <cit> , was downloaded from bushman lab . about  <dig> tissue-specific genes were collected from pagenbase, which defines genes to be tissue-specific if they are dominantly expressed in one tissue. there are  <dig> breast-specific,  <dig> colon-specific,  <dig> kidney-specific,  <dig> liver-specific,  <dig> lung-specific,  <dig> prostate-specific and  <dig> thyroid-specific genes, respectively  <cit> . different types of somatic mutations, including frameshift mutations, germline mutations, missense mutations, large deletions, splicing mutations and translocations were collected from cosmic  <cit> .

statistical evaluation of differential expression
paired t-test was used to detect differentially expressed genes between matched tumor and normal tissue pairs. bonferroni method was used to adjust p-values for multiple testing. hypergeometric test was used to evaluate the enrichment of different types of genes in the set of differentially expressed genes. all statistical tests in this study were implemented in r   <cit> .

cytoscape was used to visualize protein-protein interaction data from pina <dig>  <cit> . only genes interacting with the rbp of interest were shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

pairwise spearman correlations were calculated between the copy number alterations/dna methylation alterations and gene expression changes for differentially and non-differentially expressed rbps. the statistical difference of the correlation coefficients were assessed by wilcoxon rank sum test  <cit> .

clustering by biological pathways
kegg pathways are wiring diagrams of molecular interactions, reactions, and relations, and mainly used for biological interpretation of higher-level systemic functions. different cancers may have consistent changes in some cancer related pathways. to find those pathways similarly altered across different cancers, we performed hierarchical clustering under some specific pathways, including cell cycle, cell proliferation, pathways in cancer and etc. the distance matrix was calculated by spearman correlation coefficient of expression alteration between different cancer types.
