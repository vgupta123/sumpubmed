BACKGROUND
metazoan cells are formed from a combination of nuclear  dna and mitochondrial  dna . animal mitochondrial genomes commonly include two ribosomal rrnas,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> protein-coding genes. the latter gene-class encode for the proteins of the respiratory chain , a multi-complex system , which in aerobic cells, transports electrons from nadh or fadh <dig> to molecular oxygen. this results in a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that drives the synthesis of cellular energy . mutations in mitochondrial genes and some of the  <dig> or so nuclear genes that make up the rc are associated with a broad range of diseases, ageing and cancer
 <cit> .

mitochondrial genomes are of intrinsic importance for cellular function, but through their nucleotide and amino acid sequences are also of great utility as a source of markers for systematics and molecular ecology , and also in forensics . as their characterization is becoming easier and cheaper, increasing interest in comparative mitogenomics and the use of entire mtdnas in systematics is gathering pace for some animal groups, particularly vertebrates; e.g. birds
 <cit> , mammals
 <cit> , fish
 <cit>  and amphibians. currently, there are over  <dig> complete mtdnas characterized for amphibia , and many more for the other groups.

amphibians colonized land ~ <dig> million years ago and have since evolved into a wide variety of ecological and morphological types. over  <dig>  species of amphibians have been described to date, with the number of new species being discovered increasing annually
 <cit> . paradoxically, amphibian populations are undergoing a drastic global decline due to anthropogenic influences such as habitat destruction and pollution but also due to diseases such as the fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis . thus, there is a pressing need to catalogue and monitor an ever-changing amphibian biodiversity, and to record fluctuations in species ranges as they are influenced by disease, environmental and ecological change. many amphibian species can be morphologically similar over the course of their life cycles but molecular tools can aid in their identification, regardless of developmental stage. typically, a relatively small sequence of mtdna  encompassing part of one gene  or a few genes  is used for resolving the identity and/or the phylogeny of amphibian species. dna barcode efficacy depends upon a marker being able to differentiate between inter- and intra-specific variation and they are not always completely reliable
 <cit> . nucleotide diversity across the mitochondrial genomes of metazoa is also highly variable
 <cit> , suggesting that molecular-based studies might benefit from the study of complete mtdnas. depending on goals and methodology, complete mtdnas provide access to regions of high variation , low variation , or simply an opportunity to select from among all available sites to devise markers for a particular analysis or purpose .

traditional approaches for sequencing them have required grams of tissue to extract and enrich sufficient quantities of ‘pure’ mtdna . for small-bodied amphibians, this might necessitate the pooling of tissues from several individuals, increasing the chance of heterogeneous mtdna variants. also, trace amounts of nuclear dna  may remain in the ‘pure’ mtdna, thus introducing the possibility of amplifying mitochondrial pseudogenes and introducing errors into the final sequence . enrichment for mitochondrial dna can minimize the likelihood of amplifying mitochondrial pseudogenes
 <cit> , and targeted long-pcr based approaches are likely to avoid single, or short concatenated lengths of pseudogenes. even if pure mtdna is obtained, unless a suitable optimized primer set for the target species is available, primer-walking  is time-consuming.

in this study we validate two similar approaches for rapidly and efficiently obtaining complete mitochondrial genomes from individual amphibian species. starting with as little as one egg, both approaches combine long-pcr with next generation sequencing . amplifying complete mtdnas in a few overlapping fragments using long-pcr reduces the amount of starting material; we achieved complete coverage of mtdnas with just two primer pairs. our first approach is more costly and involves long-pcr followed by  <dig> sequencing of individual mtdnas and generates high quality sequence data, with a very high depth of coverage per nucleotide . this amount of coverage is unnecessarily high for most applications, thus a second approach that involves long-pcr followed by  <dig> of multiple pooled mtdnas was also validated
 <cit> , offering a better balance between cost and data quality. the depth of coverage per nucleotide obtained using the latter approach still far exceeds that commonly obtained by primer-walking .

we chose to validate the two approaches for amphibians in general using material from xenopus, in part due to ease of access to material but also due to their popularity as a model organism for understanding vertebrate growth and development . here we use the term ‘xenopus’ as a common noun for frogs in the genera xenopus and silurana, sister taxa that were until recently combined in a single genus. two new complete xenopus mitochondrial genomes were obtained; xenopus borealis and x. victorianus. the latter represents the first mitochondrial genome obtained from the next generation sequencing of so many  pooled long-pcr amplicons. two existing xenopus sequences  were used to design the ‘universal’ primers for the long-pcr and to annotate the features of the new genomes, and used as a basis for comparative analyses. although xenopus are the most intensively studied amphibians, providing insights into cellular reprogramming, organogenesis, regeneration, gene regulatory networks and protein interactions
 <cit> , the role of mitochondrial dna  in these processes has received relatively little attention. characterizing mtdnas of individual species and conducting comparative mitogenomic analyses are important first steps in developing this knowledge further. we analysed xenopus mtdnas in terms of simple descriptors and pairwise comparisons involving measures of variation and selection to explore further the utility of mitochondrial genomes in xenopus research. species of xenopus are also all notably polyploid, which renders nuclear gene markers less suitable for reconstructing phylogenies. in this context we assessed the suitability of complete mitochondrial genomes alone in resolving xenopus phylogeny, as well as the suitability of existing mtdna barcodes for differentiating xenopus species, populations and individuals.

RESULTS
verification of long-pcr amplicon identity and primer region sequences
the complete mitochondrial genome of one female each of x. borealis  and x. victorianus  was obtained by long-pcr amplification of  <dig> ng of egg dna in two adjacent amplicons. amplicon  <dig> was ~ <dig>  bp and amplicon  <dig> was ~ <dig>  bp in size, as predicted from published mtdnas of xenopus frogs . typically, each long-pcr reaction yielded  <dig> μg of each amplicon, as determined via the picogreen assay. conventional pcr amplification of amplicon  <dig> with rrnl and/or cox <dig> primers generated ~580bp and 190bp fragments, respectively . the sequence obtained from the rrnl fragment was 100% identical to that deposited in the ncbi nucleotide database for xenopus borealis, confirming the specific identity of the xb sample used in this study. sequences of cox <dig> for xb are absent from the database. nonetheless, the sequence obtained using the cox <dig> primers was 80% and 81% identical to corresponding regions found within the x. laevis  and silurana tropicalis  mitochondrial genomes. reference sequences for rrnl of xv were also absent from the database, but the sequence obtained shared a 98% nucleotide identity with the corresponding region in the xl mitochondrial genome. since the two long-pcr amplicons were adjacent, rather than overlapping, fragments  containing the longf1/r <dig> and long f2/r <dig> primer regions, respectively, were amplified  and sequenced. each primer region was 100% identical to the corresponding regions found within the appropriate xenopus mitochondrial genome derived by  <dig> .

automated sequencing and assembly of the xenopus mitochondrial genomes
the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of xenopus borealis  and x. victorianus  were  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp in size, respectively , thus similar in size to the two published xenopus sequences . the xb and xv mitochondrial genomes were assembled from  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads respectively; see table  <dig>  the mean read lengths were ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  nucleotides and the total data contributing to the assembled sequences was ~ <dig>  mb  and ~ <dig>  mb  . mean depth of coverage  for every nucleotide position ranged from 4923- <dig>  and 1- <dig>  , and the mean doc over the entire mitochondrial genome was ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig> .

annotation and characterisation of the xenopus mitochondrial genomes
length, gene content and order
the gene content and order is the same for all four xenopus mitochondrial genomes in having  <dig> protein coding genes , the nicotinamide dehydrogenase subunits 1– <dig> , cytochrome b  and adenosine triphosphatase subunits  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> transfer rnas  and the small  and large  ribosomal rnas . all protein coding genes, apart from nad <dig>  are predicted to be transcribed from the same strand and in the same direction.

since the gene order and content of mitochondrial genomes is thought to be reflective of phylogenetic relationships, with such features changing relatively rarely between closely related taxa
 <cit> , it is not surprising they are identical for the four xenopus mitochondrial genomes. the gene order and content of the four xenopus mitochondrial genomes is also typical of that found in vertebrates , as is often the case for “archaeobatrachian”  anurans like xenopus
 <cit>  but not “neobatrachian”  anurans
 <cit> .

in higher eukaryotes, the h-strand and l-strands each contain a distinct replication origin . h-strand replication begins in the d-loop, whereas l-strand replication does not begin until approximately two-thirds of the h-strand has been replicated. the st, xb and xv d-loops each contained a sequence 75-90% similar to the xl oh sequence . similarly, the st, xb and xv mitochondrial genomes each contained a sequence 79-91% similar to the ol sequence . these regions likely represent the replication origins in these species.

base-pair composition, codon usage and amino acid propensity
the mean gc content for all xenopus h-strand protein-coding genes was similar , as was the asymmetric usage of the four base pairs between the h- and l-strands, i.e. the gc skew is - <dig>   and the at skew is - <dig>  ; see table  <dig>  like other chordata, xenopus h-strand protein coding genes are relatively gc-rich when compared to the following groups e.g. annelida, arthropoda, cnidaria, echinodermata, mollusca, platyhelminthes and porifera that all have lower gc-means . surprisingly, xenopus h-strand protein coding gene gc-richness in this study is most similar to that reported for mammalia and testudines  rather than that reported for amphibia , previously. calculating gc and at skew indices
 <cit>  revealed that xenopus h-strand protein coding genes show an asymmetric distribution of the four bases between the h and l-strands, like many other metazoans
 <cit> . unusual among metazoa, the gc and at asymmetries observed in xenopus h-strand protein coding genes were both negative . however, the gc-skew  observed in xenopus h-strand coding genes is more pronounced than the at-skew , typical among metazoans. such asymmetry is thought to be positively correlated with how long the h-strand remains single stranded during replication, increasing the time it is exposed to mutation
 <cit> . on this basis, the mutation rate in xenopus h-strand protein coding genes could well be different to that observed in other amphibians .

percentage mean ± standard deviation  base-pairs in xenopus h-strand protein-coding genes. skew  between base-pairs was calculated as follows: gc skew = /total and at skew = /total.

the codon usage was identical to that of other vertebrate mitogenomes, including other amphibians
 <cit> : all  <dig> of the xenopus protein coding genes use atg as an initiation codon, with the exception of the cox <dig> gene in st, xb and xv that uses either taa or gtg. the most frequent termination codons used by xenopus mitogenomes were tar and agr, again characteristic of vertebrate/amphibian mitogenomes
 <cit> . the next most frequently used termination codon was incomplete, a single nucleotide t, where the post-transcriptional polyadenylation is thought to complete a taa termination codon, as suggested for amphibians and humans .

phylogenetic analysis
from the published mtdnas available on genbank, two taxa were selected as suitable outgroups: hymenochirus boettgeri  and pipa carvalhoi . both are members of the pipinae, sister to the xenopodinae  and their mtdnas were published as part of a phylogenetic study of tongueless frogs by
 <cit> . the full alignment of protein-coding genes consisted of  <dig>  amino acids, with few indels , and was deemed unambiguously aligned; of the aligned sites,  <dig>   were identical. the resulting bayesian phylogenetic analysis of concatenated protein coding genes, analysed as amino acids, is shown in figure  <dig>  each node is supported unequivocally with maximal nodal support . amongst the ingroup, the xenopodinae, silurana  was resolved as sister to a monophyletic clade of xenopus, within which x. laevis and x. victorianus were resolved as sister taxa. these results are consistent with other recently published phylogenies; e.g. one that used a  <dig> bp region of mitochondrial dna  and one that used cytb, rrnl and rrns and several nuclear genes as markers ), also analysed as nucleotides
 <cit> . the strong nodal support within the phylogeny suggests that many more species might be accommodated in an analysis of xenopodinae  using all mitochondrial protein coding genes. currently, there are  <dig> species of xenopus and  <dig> species of silurana considered valid within this subfamily
 <cit> . the genera are differentiated based on their chromosome complements. in silurana chromosome numbers are multiples of  <dig> , in xenopus chromosome numbers are multiples of  <dig>  with all species polyploid . extant species are distributed across africa but fossil forms from brazil and argentina suggest a possible gondwanan origin of the pipidae, and other fossils from africa demonstrate a considerably wider historical distribution in africa
 <cit> . a mitogenomic approach to the systematics of xenopodinae may provide additional insights into their evolutionary origins and patterns of radiation.

sliding window analysis
the four complete xenopus mitochondrial genomes were aligned in their entirety, at the nucleotide level, to estimate nucleotide divergence k  across the genome as revealed by sliding window analysis using dnasp
 <cit> ; high values of k indicate greater sequence differences. greatest divergence was observed in the comparison between d-loops; as expected considering the considerable sequence variability and difficulty in aligning these regions. gene by gene diversity, as estimated by nucleotide divergence, was highly variable , and was highest in nad4l and atp <dig>  and least in rrns. the commonly used mitochondrial ‘barcodes’ for amphibians, partial rrnl 
 <cit>  and partial cox <dig> 
 <cit> , the latter promoted by the consortium for the barcode of life , are also indicated on figure  <dig>  viewed in the context of overall nucleotide diversity, the 16s barcode captures less than coi, and both capture regions of relatively low sequence diversity across the mitochondrial genome. novel molecular markers and barcodes that must achieve universality in their use across taxa, must have priming sites in conserved regions, as indicated by troughs in the graph; e.g. as seen at the 5’- and 3’-ends of the 16s barcode. given that trna genes can move, duplicate or change identity , ideal priming sites should be within ribosomal or protein coding genes, and as gene order changes can occur, it may be preferable to target single gene fragments.

given the unique interest in xenopus as a model laboratory organism, it is necessary to consider hitherto unused regions of the mtdna that may be of use as molecular markers. populations of xenopus used in labs worldwide are thought to have originated from different regions of africa, and have been interbred, and indeed inbred, to varying degrees. different populations could be identified through their maternal lineages via mitochondrial markers. regions of high diversity may be of greatest utility here. the taxonomy of the group is also replete with subspecies and reliable markers are required for systematic revision as well as diagnosis.

targeting regions of xenopus mtdna for novel molecular marker design depends very much on the intended application, and preferred technique. pcr-based amplifications of within-gene regions for bidirectional sequencing are a common starting point for differentiating individuals, populations and species. the sliding window analysis provides some regions worthy of pursuit. although amongst the most variable of protein-coding genes, nad4l may be too short to be usable. however, alternative genes offering reasonable length  include atp <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig>  by far the most variable regions of the mtdnas is the d-loop. however, if this were to be a chosen target for within or between species study, it would likely need to be amplified in its entirety. high at-content, the propensity for secondary structure folding and length differences make it difficult to design suitable pcr primers within the d-loop. however, fortuitously, two well-conserved genes  border the d-loop and these offer many regions for potential pcr primer design.

although none of the suggested markers were tested in this study, we found the software mitomapper  was readily applicable to our xenopus data, yielding either suites of primer pairs to generate overlapping amplicons for complete de novo mtdna coverage, or primer pairs for targeting shorter gene/genome regions . the program designs primers that will work on the input sequences as well as other closely related taxa.

combining the two new mitogenomes with those already available will also facilitate the design of novel molecular markers for resolving e.g. the phylogenies of pipids and amphibians as a whole and the design of conserved primers for long pcr and the assembly of next generation sequencing contigs.

dn/ds analysis
the ratio of nonsynonymous  to synonymous  substitutions observed within the xenopus protein-coding sequences suggests that all genes are evolving under negative  selection. complex iv genes , the complex iii gene , some of the complex i genes  and one of the complex v genes  are under strong selection, with the remaining complex i genes  and one of the complex v genes  under weaker selection . these findings are concordant with study where dn/ds ratios were estimated from  <dig> complete vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, which included  <dig> from amphibians, that showed that purifying selection was strongest for genes that encode subunits with crucial functions in the rc
 <cit> . indeed, complex iv subunits cox1- <dig> and complex i subunits nd <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> do have crucial functions in the rc. specifically, the cox <dig> and cox <dig> subunits of complex iv perform the electron and proton transfers, as well as creating the channels required for the dioxygen molecule to reach, and the h2o molecule to be removed from, the o <dig> reduction site
 <cit> . while the cox <dig> subunits  are also thought to be involved in proton transfers, they also provide structural stability between the cox <dig> and  <dig> subunits . while the complex i subunits nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig> perform the proton pumping and nd <dig> provides structural stability between the membrane and peripheral domains of the complex. nd <dig> has an additional role as a “coupling element”, connecting all the membrane subunits together
 <cit> .

expressed sequence tag analysis
in total,  <dig> ests with ≥90% similarity at the nucleotide level, to the protein coding genes of st were recovered from the cdna libraries deposited in xenbase
 <cit> . complex iv  genes were significantly more represented than those of complex i  and the complex iii gene  . interestingly, complex iv genes under the strongest purifying selection were also the most highly expressed. this correlation has been observed in several organisms, from bacteria to humans . given that complex iv subunits perform such crucial functions in the rc and are expressed so highly, it is not really surprising that the genes that encode them contain few non-synonymous substitutions, relative to other genes. preserving complex iv gene function by purifying selection would avoid mutations that cause amino acid changes that could lead to the production of dysfunctional subunits and ultimately, a compromised rc. this is likely to be even more important if such genes are highly expressed. 

ngs approaches to mtdna sequencing
in this study, two new xenopus  complete mitochondrial genome sequences were obtained using a combination of long-pcr and next generation sequencing  of either individual or multiple pooled mtdnas. this is the first report of amphibian mitochondrial genomes obtained using this approach. the relative ease with which the high quality genomes were obtained, due to:  the long-pcr step minimizing the amount of starting material  required and  the  <dig> sequencing step removing the need for an optimized primer set  and generating a high level of coverage , makes ngs a very promising approach for other amphibians. it is immediately applicable to other xenopus species/individuals, as all the primers used in this study were designed to be universal for xenopus mtdnas. furthermore, both approaches generate depths of coverage that far surpass traditional primer-walking strategies at either the same cost  or less .

CONCLUSIONS
here we provide two approaches for the rapid and efficient amplification of amphibian mitogenomes from microgram quantities of tissue. specifically, two new xenopus mitogenomes  were obtained, characterised and compared to their sister taxa , two of the most intensely studied amphibians and popular vertebrate model organisms. we discovered the size was similar and gene content and order was the same among the xenopus and to other vertebrates. the phylogeny, generated using amino acids, was consistent with existing phylogenies for xenopus and amphibian species, however, some  <dig> additional species of xenopus remain to analysed using this approach and would provide additional insights into their evolution and radiation. on the one hand we reveal commonly used mitochondrial “barcodes” for differentiating amphibian species and populations fail to capture the greatest xenopus nucleotide diversity, on the other hand we provide alternative, more appropriate targets for differentiating xenopus species/populations. our exploration of protein-coding genes in the xenopus mitogenomes reveals their function is strongly preserved by negative  selection, particularly in the case of those encoding proteins that have crucial functions in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and are highly expressed, such as the complex iv proteins: co1-co <dig>  that collectively transfer protons and electrons or confer structural stability. our complete mitochondrial genome amplification methods and analyses are applicable to other amphibians and are therefore likely to be helpful for identifying the most appropriate markers for differentiating species, populations and resolving phylogenies, a pressing need since amphibians are undergoing drastic global decline. our findings also provide a platform for using xenopus to better understanding the critical role mitogenomes play in complex biological problems, such as cellular reprogramming, organogenesis, regeneration, gene regulatory networks and protein interactions that control growth and development.
