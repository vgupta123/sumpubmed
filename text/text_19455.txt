BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis is a complex biological process involving a number of cellular events including mitosis, meiosis, cell migration, apoptosis and differentiation, which enable the germ cells to undergo several developmental stages, from spermatogonia to primary and secondary spermatocytes, round spermatids and eventually spermatozoa. it takes approximately 35 days in mice.

to date, hundreds of hsp40s derived from various species have been identified, of which several proteins are involved in spermatogenesis  <cit> . a human dnaj homologue, dnaja <dig> , binds to the pituitary tumor-transforming gene protein and then plays a role in spermatogenesis  <cit> . evidence from dnaja1-mutant mice has shown that dnaja <dig> plays a critical role in spermiogenesis by regulating androgen receptor signaling. the dnajb <dig>  gene encodes a dnaj protein highly expressed in spermatids and spermatozoa of both rodents and amphibians  <cit> , <cit> . it may be involved in vesicle fusion and protein quality control by means of interaction with heat shock proteins  <cit> . molecular chaperones belonging to the superfamily of heat shock proteins , their co-chaperones, and the ubiquitination/deubiquitination system may be involved in the production of high-quality spermatozoa  <cit> . hsp40s generally function as co-chaperones in the hsp <dig> chaperone systems  <cit> - <cit>  that are involved in many processes in cells.

mammalian cells possess a large and diverse family of hsp40/ dnaj proteins, and they can be divided into three subgroups, type i, ii, and iii, according to the presence or absence of the gly/ phe-rich region and the cysteine repeats  <cit> . dnajb <dig>   is a type ii hsp40/dnaj protein. dnajb <dig>  is also known as tsarg <dig>   <cit> . in a previous study, we first reported that dnajb <dig> was expressed abundantly in mouse testis and up-regulated in cryptorchidism  <cit> . guan et al. characterized dnajb <dig> in mature mouse testes and epididymal spermatozoa  <cit> . to date, however, little is known about the time of origin and location of dnajb <dig> during mouse spermatogenesis, which is an important clue to clarifying its function. this study intends to identify the expression pattern of dnajb <dig> progressively and constitutively during mammalian spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
 <dig>  dnajb <dig> mrna and dnajb <dig> protein strongly expressed in testis, lung, oviduct and trachea
we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  to study the expression profile of dnajb <dig> mrna in different mouse tissues. the results showed that the dnajb <dig> gene was extremely strongly expressed in adult testis, lung, oviduct and trachea . gapdh was expressed in all kinds of tissues. we also performed immunoblotting to study the expression pattern of dnajb <dig> in different mouse tissues. the results showed that dnajb <dig> was expressed in adult testis, lung, oviduct, and trachea , being consistent with the rt-pcr results. by multi-tissue rt-pcr and western blot, we found that the dnajb <dig> gene and dnajb <dig> protein were expressed not only in the testis, but also in several other ciliated cell-containing tissues like the trachea, lung and oviduct. in mammals, both sperm flagella and cilia are related to cell migration and movement. therefore, we speculated that the dnajb <dig> gene may be associated with cell migration and movement.

 <dig>  expression pattern of dnajb <dig> mrna and dnajb <dig> protein located at different developmental periods of mouse testis
the different developmental periods of 1- to 9-week-old mice testes were collected for total rna and protein preparations, which were subsequently subjected to real-time quantitative pcr   and immunoblotting  analyses, respectively. as shown in figure 2a, in mouse testis, the expression of dnajb <dig> mrna was detected as early as postnatal week  <dig>  was developmentally up-regulated at postnatal week  <dig> when the round spermatids began to appear, and then was constant. after postnatal week  <dig> its expression was constant at a high level. gapdh was expressed at various development periods in mouse testis as a control. we also performed immunoblotting to study the expression pattern of dnajb <dig> in these testes. the expression of dnajb <dig> was undetectable until postnatal week  <dig> when elongated spermatids were apparent . these data demonstrate that the expression of the dnajb <dig> gene was developmentally regulated and there was an apparent delay in dnajb <dig> protein translation. dnajb <dig> expressed from postnatal week  <dig> of mouse testis suggested that dnajb <dig> was expressed in the spermatids and spermatozoa.

 <dig>  in situ hybridization of dnajb <dig> in mouse testis at different developmental periods
the cellular localization of dnajb <dig> mrna expression was determined by in situ hybridization of mouse testis sections. the specific tawny hybridization signal in the cytoplasm was distributed inside the tubules from week  <dig> , increased in week  <dig>  and then had a stable expression. such a distribution is characteristic of the stage-specific expression of dnajb <dig> during mouse spermatogenesis, and is compatible with the qpcr of dnajb <dig> in the mouse seminiferous tubule. the positive signals correspond to the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids located along the spermatogonia in the basement membrane distant from the boundary of the tubules. under identical conditions, the control probe did not give any signal.

 <dig>  immunohistochemical detection of dnajb <dig> in mouse testis at different developmental periods
the seminiferous epithelium from different developmental periods of mouse testis contained different spermatogenic cells. there were only primitive type a spermatogonia in the seminiferous epithelium of 0-week-old and 1-week-old mice. type a and type b spermatogonia appeared in the seminiferous epithelium of 8-day-old mouse testis. preleptotene spermatocytes were the smallest germ cells in sections of 10-day-old mouse testis. pachytene spermatocytes were observed in the testis of 14-day-old mice. round spermatids began to appear in the seminiferous epithelium of 18-day-old mouse testis  <cit> .

subcellular localization and distribution of the dnajb <dig> protein at defined stages of spermatogenesis were revealed. the dnajb <dig> immunohistochemical signal was first seen very weakly in the round spermatid cytoplasm of 3-week-old mice; the signal intensity of dnajb <dig> increased as spermiogenesis proceeded. a distinct expression pattern of dnajb <dig> was restricted to the spermatid layer in the mice from week  <dig>  the dnajb <dig> immunosignal was present in the cytoplasm of spermatids and flagella of mature spermatozoa that were about to be released into the tubular lumen , consistent with the wb result of dnajb <dig> in different developmental periods of mouse testis. no immunosignal was detected in any other spermatogenic or somatic cells in the testicular sections. the negative control using pre-immune serum was free of any signal.

notably, there is a discrepancy between the immunoblotting and immunohistochemical results. the wb data indicated that the expression of dnajb <dig> was undetectable until postnatal week  <dig>  the dnajb <dig> immunohistochemical signal was first seen very weakly in 3-week-old mice, the signal intensity increasing in postnatal week  <dig>  although round spermatids began to appear in 18-day-old mouse testis, they comprised only 1% of the seminiferous epithelium cells , rising to 4% in 20-day-old mouse testis. immunoblotting did not detect dnajb <dig> protein in postnatal week  <dig> mice. however, a very weak immunohistochemical signal was observed in cross sections of seminiferous epithelium in 3-week-old mice.

as shown above, dnajb <dig> proteins were expressed in testis, trachea, lung and oviduct. we chose testis as a target tissue to investigate the function of dnajb <dig> in spermatogenesis. the results of the sequential expression profile in mouse testis showed that the dnajb <dig> protein was expressed distinctly at postnatal week  <dig>  more importantly, the positioning study confirmed the expression of dnajb <dig> in the cytoplasm of spermatids and the flagella of mature spermatozoa.

the location of dnajb <dig> in the flagella of mature spermatozoa indicates its function in sperm motility. the flagellum is a major part of the spermatozoon. the core of the flagellum is a microtubular structure called the axoneme. during spermiogenesis, the axoneme develops from one of the two centrioles to form the flagellum. as the axoneme grows, accessory components including mitochondria, outer dense fibers, a fibrous sheath and an annulus are added to the flagellum to form the sperm middle, principal and end pieces.

in a previous study, yang c found that rsp <dig>  a homologous protein of dnajb <dig> in chlamydomonas, may function as a co-chaperone in the assembly of radial spokes. in a further study, knockdown of rsp <dig> influenced flagellar motility, and this motility defect could be rescued by rsp <dig> without the j domain  <cit> , <cit> . guan j considered that dnajb <dig> was localized to the radial spokes of the mouse axoneme  <cit> . using immunoelectron microscopy analyses of human sperm, we have found that dnajb <dig> is not only localized on the radial spokes of the axoneme in human sperm flagella, but also in other flagellar structures . our results validate the views of yang c and guan j. therefore, we suggest that dnajb <dig> influences sperm motility.

the expression of dnajb <dig> in spermatids indicates the protein may participate in spermiogenesis. spermiogenesis is the final stage of spermatogenesis. during this morphogenetic process, shaping and condensation of the nucleus as well as the formation of the acrosome and the tail take place. spermiogenesis takes about 2– <dig> weeks in mice. at this stage, the haploid germ cells do not divide, but morphogenesis occurs  <cit> . these dramatic changes require a stringent, well-coordinated and unique system that regulates specific patterns of gene and protein expression  <cit> . several hsp <dig> proteins are involved in spermiogenesis. dnaj protein msj- <dig>  is a molecular chaperone expressed in spermatids and spermatozoa  <cit> . mubpy and msj- <dig> label the cytoplasmic side of the acrosomal membrane and the centrosome in mouse spermatozoa, and could have a key role during mouse fertilization  <cit> . dja <dig> mice revealed a primary defect of sertoli cells in maintaining spermiogenesis at steps  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . more thorough work is needed to elucidate the function and mechanism of dnajb <dig> in spermiogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized the profile of the dnajb <dig> gene and dnajb <dig> protein in different mouse tissues at different developmental periods. we revealed a spatiotemporal association of dnajb <dig>  a type ii hsp <dig>  with the testis and elucidated that dnajb <dig> is expressed in the cytoplasm of spermatids and the flagella of mature spermatozoa. we suggest that dnajb <dig> participates in the process of spermiogenesis and sperm movement.
