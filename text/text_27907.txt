BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus was identified as a causative agent in 19 % of foodborne outbreaks that were reported in the united states from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . although the majority of these outbreaks were traced back to rice  and meat   <cit> , b. cereus group isolates have also been frequently isolated from milk e.g.,  <cit> . b. cereus spores can survive high temperature exposure, therefore insufficient cooling or storage of food at temperatures below 60 °c can support their growth in food following thermal treatment. depending on the strain, growth to high levels may result in food spoilage and present a risk for foodborne illness after ingestion  <cit> .

the b. cereus group consists of eight pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species – b. cereus, b. anthracis, b. thuringiensis, b. cytotoxicus, b. weihenstephanensis, b. mycoides, b. pseudomycoides, and b. toyonensis  <cit> . this group of bacterial species is also referred to as b. cereus sensu lato with the specific species b. cereus being referred to as b. cereus sensu stricto. members of the b. cereus group are closely related and cannot always be differentiated based on phenotypic and biochemical characteristics as detailed in the bergey’s manual of determinative bacteriology  <cit> . nevertheless, some specific phenotypic characteristics have traditionally been used to differentiate key species within the b. cereus group. for example, a combination of capsule production, non-motility and inability to cause hemolysis is specific for b. anthracis, the production of crystal proteins is specific for b. thuringiensis, and rhizoid colony morphology is specific for b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides  <cit> . in addition, the ability to grow at 7 °c but not at 43 °c is typically considered to be specific for b. weihenstephanensis  <cit> . even with molecular methods, species classification of b. cereus group isolates can be challenging. for example, the human pathogens b. cereus and b. anthracis, and the insect pathogen b. thuringiensis cannot be reliably differentiated with most molecular typing methods, including dna sequence analysis of 16s rdna, rpob and mlst loci  <cit> . consistent with these findings, studies employing whole genome sequencing have confirmed high genomic similarity of b. cereus, b. thuringiensis and b. anthracis, which explains the difficulties in speciation of b. cereus group isolates .

due to the highly similar genomic backbone of b. cereus group isolates, different studies have explored whether characterization of virulence gene presence/absence patterns may provide a better predictor of a strain’s ability to cause anthrax or gastrointestinal disease, compared to traditional phenotypic or molecular taxonomic classification. these methods typically determine the presence/absence of b. cereus group virulence genes encoded on plasmids or within the chromosome, which were previously linked to virulence in humans and/or animals. among plasmid-encoded virulence genes are those encoding the anthrax toxin  and the poly-γ-d-glutamate capsule biosynthesis genes   <cit> . these virulence determinants are encoded on pxo <dig>  pxo <dig> or similar plasmids, which have been identified among b. anthracis isolates, as well as b. cereus isolates able to cause anthrax or anthrax-like disease in humans and animals . the cesabcd operon represents another set of virulence genes encoded on plasmids . these genes encode cereulide synthetase necessary for non-ribosomal biosynthesis of the emetic toxin cereulide, which causes a food-borne intoxication in humans  <cit> . lastly, strains carrying plasmid-encoded crystal protein genes  are pathogenic to insects, but crystal proteins do not affect humans  <cit> .

in contrast, genes encoding the virulence determinants implicated in the diarrheal type of the foodborne disease are typically chromosomally encoded. examples include hemolysin bl , nonhemolytic enterotoxin , cytotoxin k  and cereolysin   <cit> . genes encoding diarrheal toxins are distributed across different b. cereus group species, including b. cereus, b. thuringiensis, b. weihenstephanensis, b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides . expression of these toxins is governed by complex regulation pathways, which are not well understood . in addition to these principal virulence genes, multiple other genes exist, which may indirectly contribute to virulence, such as hlyii, entfm and entabc, which encode hemolysin ii, enterotoxin fm, and a putative enterotoxin, respectively  <cit> .

overall, classification into currently defined species within the b. cereus group does not provide for reliable identification of isolates that are or are not likely to cause human foodborne disease. for example, production of diarrheal toxins in the b. cereus group is not species - specific. while some attempts have been made to use single locus  sequence data to develop alternative classification approaches that allow for more accurate assessment of pathogenicity and virulence of b. cereus group isolates  <cit> , these approaches still require significant refinement and further data. in particular, the accuracy of classification into seven phylogenetic groups, as determined based on panc sequences needs to be confirmed using whole genome sequences. the diversity of b. cereus group isolates evaluated to-date by wgs has included only a limited number of food isolates and, to our knowledge, few genome sequences for dairy isolates are publicly available. however, sporeforming pathogens and spoilage organisms are becoming increasingly important in dairy products as reduced post-processing contamination with rapidly growing gram-negative bacteria provide an opportunity for growth of b. cereus group isolates that would not compete well in the presence of many gram-negative bacteria introduced by post-processing contamination. hence, we have carried out a comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> dairy-associated b. cereus group isolates and  <dig> b. cereus group isolates with publicly available genome sequences to investigate their  phylogenetic clustering based on core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms ,  clustering based on the virulence gene presence/absence, and  distribution of hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic toxin production among isolates in different phylogenetic clades.

RESULTS
identification of multiple novel mlst allelic and sequence types reflects the diversity of dairy-associated b. cereus group isolates
whole genome sequencing was performed for  <dig> diverse dairy-associated isolates  that had been identified as members of b. cereus group based on rpob sequence data. the median whole genome sequence  coverage for the  <dig> isolates was 57-fold , the median number of contigs >1 kb was  <dig> , and the median draft genome size was  <dig>  mbp.table  <dig> characteristics and sequence accession numbers for dairy-associated b. cereus group isolates sequenced in this study

wgs data were initially used to extract sequence data for seven genes that are used in the b. cereus pubmlst typing scheme  <cit> . mlst data differentiated the  <dig> isolates into  <dig> different mlst sequence types , providing increased discriminatory power over rpob sequence typing that identified  <dig> different rpob allelic types . eleven of these mlst types represented novel sts in the pubmlst database   <cit> . two of them were a novel combination of existing ats and nine of them carried one to four novel allelic types, which were deposited in the pubmlst database. these data show that the isolates selected represent considerable b. cereus group strain diversity that has not been observed among isolates characterized by mlst or wgs to date. these data also demonstrate the importance of investigating populations from diverse sources when characterizing the genomic diversity of different bacterial groups. these initial analyses further justify our investigation of the genomic diversity among dairy-associated b. cereus group isolates, particularly since previous studies focused on clinical sources and food sources most commonly linked to human disease outbreaks  .

wgs-based phylogeny reveals clades consistent with rpob and mlst clustering of isolates
genome sequence data for the  <dig> dairy-associated isolates and  <dig> reference genomes  of b. cereus group isolates were used to build a core genome ksnp tree , which was based on  <dig> core genome snps. the resulting phylogeny was compared to clustering of the  <dig> dairy-associated isolates that was observed in separate phylogenies constructed with either rpob or the  <dig> mlst genes sequence data. wgs revealed nine b. cereus group clades. these clades were named according to previously proposed phylogenetic groups based on panc sequences  <cit> . where panc phylogenetic groups could be separated into different wgs clades this was clarified by use of alphabetical subdesignation . seven of wgs clades  included between two and seven dairy-associated isolates sequenced here. while the  <dig> dairy-associated isolates also clustered in seven clades in the mlst tree, these isolates represented only  <dig> phylogenetic clades in the rpob tree. specifically, one of the clades in the rpob tree was resolved into two clades in mlst tree, including one clade with isolates fsl m8- <dig> and fsl k6- <dig>  and one with fsl k6- <dig> and fsl w8- <dig> . clustering of dairy-associated isolates in the rpob and wgs trees was very similar, but not absolutely congruent, as the rpob tree did not resolve clades ii and iii-b . the wgs phylogeny was congruent with mlst phylogeny, and with the seven phylogenetic groups determined based on panc sequence similarity , which were proposed by guinebretière et al.  <cit> . overall, these data suggest that both rpob and panc single-locus-based characterization allows for classification that is expected to be largely congruent with wgs clades.fig.  <dig> core genome phylogeny of  <dig> b. cereus group isolates. maximum likelihood tree was constructed using core genome snps identified with ksnp for  <dig> dairy-associated isolates and  <dig> reference isolates. phylogeny was inferred using raxml under general time-reversible model with gamma distributed substitution sites, and  <dig> bootstrap repetitions. bar represents  <dig>  substitutions per site. wgs revealed nine b. cereus group phylogenetic clades. these clades were named according to previously proposed phylogenetic groups based on panc sequence types  <cit> . where panc phylogenetic groups could be separated into different wgs clades this was clarified by the use of alphabetical subdesignation . isolates in red carried hblacd genes and produced hemolysin bl, isolates in orange carried hblacd genes, but did not produce hemolysin bl, and isolates in blue did not carry hblacd genes nor did they produce hemolysin bl. dairy-associated isolates are in bold

genomic sequence data confirm that the b. cereus group includes both monophyletic species, as well as currently designated species that are not consistent with phylogeny
the wgs-based phylogeny constructed here includes whole genome sequence  data for  <dig> reference genomes of b. cereus group isolates that had been previously sequenced and identified at the species level by others . metadata for these reference isolates are available in additional file 1: table s <dig>  among nine clades defined here, all but clade ii  included at least one reference strain. three of the wgs clades  included reference strains of only a single species, including b. toyonensis , b. weihenstephanensis  and b. cytotoxicus . while only one reference strain genome was available for each b. toyonensis and b. cytotoxicus, both b. weihenstephanensis reference genomes analyzed clustered into clade vi. clades v and vi each, also included dairy-associated isolates. all three of these clades are supported by 100 % bootstrap values. these data suggest that b. toyonensis, b. weihenstephanensis and b. cytotoxicus represent monophyletic species. consistently with our findings, b. cytotoxicus has been previously classified in a separate phylogenetic group  <cit> .

clade i included three genomes previously identified as b. mycoides, as well as the b. pseudomycoides type strain genome. it has previously been shown that b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides isolates  cluster in two mlst clades – one including the b. pseudomycoides type strain, and the other including b. weihenstephanensis and b. mycoides type strains  <cit> . clustering of previously identified  b. mycoides genomes with genome of b. pseudomycoides type strain in our study suggests that these b. mycoides isolates were originally misclassified, and should be re-classified as b. pseudomycoides. rhizoid colony morphology is typical for both b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides and is therefore not an appropriate differentiating characteristic. classification based on panc sequence analysis is more reliable, as b. pseudomycoides cluster in panc group i, and b. mycoides in panc group vi  <cit> .

each of the remaining four clades  included both b. cereus and b. thuringiensis reference genomes. in addition to b. cereus and b. thuringiensis, clade iii-a also included all  <dig> b. anthracis reference genomes from our isolate set. these results are consistent with mlst studies that have also shown  that b. cereus and b. thuringiensis cluster together  and  that b. anthracis isolates cluster with b. cereus . overall, our data confirmed the polyphyletic nature of the species b. cereus and b. thuringiensis by demonstrating their clustering in multiple “multi-species” clades, similar to what was previously reported based on the wgs analyses . this shows that wgs phylogeny does not support the current taxonomical classification of b. cereus, b. thuringiensis and b. anthracis, and suggests that snp-based phylogenetic clustering, even at the core genome level, does not allow for identification of these species the way they are defined now. similar to our findings, previous mlst studies have shown that clustering of b. cereus group isolates does not yield clades that are consistent with species designation  <cit> . there is thus increasing and consistent evidence that supports the need for a re-alignment of the b. cereus group taxonomy to be consistent with the wgs phylogeny. the data generated here can form the basis for future development of snp-based assays that will allow for rapid identification of major b. cereus group clades and subtypes.

insecticidal crystal protein genes were not detected in all isolates previously identified as b. thuringiensis, and were detected in isolates representing other species
in order to further characterize the genomes analyzed here, we determined the presence/absence of  <dig> virulence genes  in the whole genome sequences of the  <dig> b. cereus group genomes using protein blast. the presence of  <dig> of these  <dig> virulence genes was confirmed by performing pcr on  <dig> b. cereus group isolates that were physically available to us . while standard protein blast approach was generally successful in identifying the genomic presence of virulence genes , cry, which encodes the insecticidal crystal protein typically linked to b. thuringiensis, showed substantially higher amino acid variability than other virulence-associated genes  <cit> . as this increases the chances of false negative results using protein blast, we initially searched for cry using an endotoxin_m hidden markov model  extracted from pfam database . this hmm search identified cry homologues in just  <dig> out of  <dig> b. thuringiensis genomes. to improve the sensitivity of the hmm search, we thus constructed a custom hidden markov model based on ten cry variants representing different 1° domains available in the b. thuringiensis nomenclature database  <cit> . this new model identified cry genes in  <dig> isolates , including the same  <dig> isolates that were positive for cry with the enterotoxin_m hmm search. these  <dig> isolates represented b. thuringiensis , b. weihenstephanensis , and two dairy-associated b. cereus group isolates. all genomes were also annotated with rast  <cit> , which identified cry genes in four b. thuringiensis isolates, three dairy-associated isolates and a single b. weihenstephanensis isolate. overall, cry genes were detected in  <dig> isolates by at least one of the approaches used . the challenges with detection of cry genes are consistent with previous reports that these genes are highly diverse  and demonstrate a need for further development of improved tools for detection of cry genes based on wgs data. interestingly, isolates identified as carrying cry genes were distributed across clades iii-a , iii-b , iii-c , iv , v  and vi , indicating that cry homologs are widely distributed across different clades of b. cereus group isolates.table  <dig> distribution of key virulence genes among b. cereus group species and wgs clades

anthrax toxin genes were found in isolates previously identified as b. anthracis, as well as b. cereus
protein blast identified the anthrax toxin genes cya, lef and paga in   <dig> of the  <dig> b. anthracis reference genomes  and,   <dig> out of  <dig> b. cereus reference genomes . strain ci was previously designated as b. cereus biovar anthracis because of the presence of anthrax virulence genes  <cit> . the complete capabcde operon, which encodes the components for poly-γ-d-glutamate capsule biosynthesis, was found in   <dig> of the  <dig> b. anthracis reference genomes  and,  in  <dig> of the  <dig> b. cereus genomes . hence, b. cereus strain ci carried a full complement of b. anthracis virulence genes. in addition, an incomplete capabcde operon, characterized by the absence of capb, was detected in b. cereus strains 03bb <dig> and f <dig>  as well as in b. thuringiensis bgsc 4aj <dig>  b. toyonensis bct- <dig> carried only cape . these findings are consistent with previous reports of b. cereus strains isolated from patients with anthrax-like symptoms . interestingly, two b. cereus strains that carried anthrax genes  were found in clade iii-a, which contains all b. anthracis reference genomes, while b. cereus 03bb <dig> was found in sister clade iii-b.

diarrheal toxin genes were identified across multiple b. cereus group species
a protein blast was used to identify genes previously reported as encoding  metabolic pathways for production of cereulide linked to emetic illness and  toxins linked to diarrheal illness. the cereulide synthetase gene cluster  was found in only one isolate, b. cereus ah <dig> from wgs clade iii-c. genes encoding toxins linked to diarrheal illness were found in a larger number of genomes. these genes included  hblabcd operon,  nheabc operon and  cytk. genes encoding hemolysin bl 



two different hbl operons have been identified previously  <cit> . one operon  consists of two genes encoding hemolysin bl binding component , one gene encoding lytic component l <dig> , and one gene encoding lytic component l <dig> . the second operon  consists of a single gene encoding a binding component  and the two genes encoding lytic components  of hemolysin bl. both of these operons have been previously reported in b. cereus strain atcc  <dig>  <cit> . we have identified hblacd genes encoding hemolysin bl in 10/ <dig> b. cereus isolates , 12/ <dig> b. thuringiensis isolates, all  <dig> b. mycoides isolates, both b. weihenstephanensis isolates, the only b. toyonensis isolate and  <dig> dairy-associated isolates . the b. pseudomycoides isolate carried only a hbla. thirty-seven out of  <dig> isolates that carried a gene encoding the hemolysin bl binding component hbla, also carried a longer variant of binding component-encoding gene, hblb. four hbl-encoding genes were found across all except clade vii . for the  <dig> isolates screened by pcr, pcr results were consistent with identification of hblacd genes by blast . while one study has reported presence of hblacd genes in all  <dig> tested isolates from ready-to-eat vegetables in south korea  <cit> , another study has found one or more hbl genes in  <dig>  –  <dig>  % of b. cereus group isolates from food products in brazil  <cit> . the hbla has been detected in all  <dig> b. cereus isolates from raw vegetable samples collected in mexico city  <cit> . while hbla and hbld have been detected in 72 % b. cereus isolates  from retail spices in usa, hblc has been detected in 71 % of these isolates  <cit> . the high prevalence of the genes in the hblacd operon  has also been reported in rice b. cereus isolates obtained in south korea  <cit> . on the other hand, the hblacd genes have been found less frequently  in b. cereus group isolates from fermented korean soybean products  <cit> . while at least one hbl gene has been detected in  <dig>  % of  <dig> b. cereus isolates from milk and dairy products in brazil, all three hbl genes have been detected in  <dig>  % of these isolates  <cit> . the fact that genes encoding all three toxin components are not always detected in a given isolate indicates that these genes either do not always co-exist or that false negative pcr reactions occur, e.g., due to the mismatches in primer annealing regions. similar to our study, the hblacd genes have been detected in all tested b. thuringiensis isolates from rice in korea  <cit> . on the other hand, the hblacd genes have been detected in only 67 % of the b. thuringiensis isolates from retail spices in the usa  <cit> . these results, however, are not always directly comparable due to the differences in pcr methods used across the studies. overall, our data support that hblacd genes are found across b. cereus group species and phylogenetic clades. genes encoding nonhemolytic enterotoxin 



the nheabc genes encoding the nonhemolytic enterotoxin were identified by blast for all isolates . the identification of nheabc genes by pcr was in agreement with blast results for all but  <dig> cases . in these two cases blast search identified a significant hit, but nheb pcr produced a negative result. the nheb in these two isolates showed 1 nt mismatch with the nheb forward primer annealing region, however this mismatch was found also in two other isolates with positive nheb pcr reaction, suggesting that the sequence divergence in this region was unlikely to be the cause of false negative pcr results. previously reported prevalence of nheabc genes among b. cereus group isolates has been generally higher  compared to the prevalence of hblacd genes in most studies, regardless of the strain source  <cit> . the exception is the korean study that reported lower prevalence of nheabc genes among b. cereus isolated from white rice   <cit> . genes encoding cytotoxin k 



the gene encoding cytotoxin k  was detected by blast in approximately half of the isolates from clades iii-a and iii-c, and the majority of isolates from clades iii-b, ii, iv and vii . the variant cytk- <dig>  which is specific for b. cytotoxicus, was detected only in the b. cytotoxicus reference genome, while cytk- <dig> was also detected in other genomes. results obtained by blast were consistent with results obtained by pcr for  <dig> out of  <dig> tested isolates. in two cases  where discrepancies were observed , the pcr produced a positive result, while blast did not detect any significant hits in wgs . this may be due to the inability to detect the gene located in the region of the genome that these two draft assemblies did not cover. fewer studies have previously evaluated the presence of cytk; these studies reported cytk in  <dig>  % of  <dig> dairy isolates and  <dig>  % of  <dig> b. cereus food isolates from brazil  <cit> ,  <dig>  % of  <dig> b. cereus isolated from milk and cereal products in thailand  <cit>  and  <dig>  % of  <dig> b. cereus group isolates from korean fermented soybean products  <cit> .

gene encoding putative cell wall peptidase 
the gene encoding a putative cell wall peptidase  was identified by blast in all isolates except b. cereus ft <dig>  the entfm was also detected in all  <dig> isolates tested by pcr . the product of this gene is a putative virulence factor, reported to be involved in bacterial shape, motility, adhesion to epithelial cells, biofilm formation, and vacuolization of macrophages  <cit> .

virulence gene profiles among dairy-associated isolates
the  <dig> dairy-associated isolates did not carry anthrax-associated virulence genes, nor genes encoding emetic toxin biosynthetic pathway. thirteen out of  <dig> dairy-associated strains screened by pcr carried all eight tested diarrheal toxin genes as well as entfm . the same toxin profile was most commonly identified among b. cereus group strains isolated from pasteurized milk and cereal products in thailand  <cit> . importantly, hblacd, nheabc, cytk and entfm were also found in two dairy-associated isolates, fsl k6- <dig> and fsl h7- <dig>  which clustered in b. weihenstephanensis clade vi. the hblacd, nheabc and entfm genes were present in two reference b. weihenstephanensis isolates as well, initially suggesting that this psychrotolerant species may present not only a food spoilage risk, but that some strains of this species may also pose a public health concern. subsequent experiments described in detail below, however found that an antibody-based assay did not detect hemolysin bl in these two b. weihenstephanensis isolates, indicating that further characterization of these isolates is needed to fully assess their pathogenicity.

anthrax toxin genes, diarrheal toxin genes and crystal protein-encoding genes are not exclusively associated with b. anthracis, b. cereus, and b. thuringiensis species, respectively
to test for potential association of different b. cereus group species with certain toxin gene profiles, we analyzed the virulence gene presence/absence data by principal component analysis . the first  <dig> and  <dig> principal components  cumulatively described  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of variance in the data, respectively. clustering of isolates based on virulence gene presence/absence was visualized by plotting eigenvectors associated with pc  <dig> , pc  <dig>  and pc  <dig>  . pc  <dig> was omitted, as it specifically characterized a single isolate carrying cereulide synthetase gene cluster .fig.  <dig> pca clustering of b. cereus group isolates based on virulence gene presence/absence. pca analysis was carried out using the data on presence/absence of  <dig> virulence genes that had variable presence across the analyzed  <dig> isolates. reference isolates are color-coded according to the previously identified species, and all  <dig> dairy-associated isolates are labeled as “b. cereus group”. the figure demonstrates clustering of analyzed isolates based on the pc  <dig> , pc  <dig>  and pc  <dig> . pc  <dig> was omitted, as it specifically characterized a single isolate carrying genes that encode the cereulide biosynthetic pathway. the b. cereus and b. anthracis and b. cereus isolates carrying anthrax toxin and poly-γ-d-glutamate capsule genes form a clearly separated group on the bottom left side of the figure, while environmental isolates and b. cytotoxicus tend to cluster on the upper right side. isolates carrying genes associated with diarrheal foodborne disease cluster on the bottom right side



b. cereus group isolates formed three pca clusters  that each included isolates of multiple species. the first cluster is comprised of b. anthracis and b. cereus isolates carrying anthrax and/or capsular biosynthesis genes , the second one is comprised of nonpathogenic b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides, as well as b. cytotoxicus , while the majority of b. cereus, b. thuringiensis and b. weihenstephanensis remained unresolved in the third cluster associated with diarrheal toxin genes .

the first plotted principal component  was associated with the presence of genes coding for diarrheal toxins hemolysin bl , cereolysin a and b , cytotoxin , crystal protein , phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase c  and enterotoxic protein . additionally, pc  <dig> was associated with absence of genes encoding anthrax toxin , poly-γ-d-glutamate capsule biosynthesis genes , global transcription regulator , hyaluronic acid synthase , hemolysin ii  and hemolysin ii regulator . the second plotted principal component  was associated with presence of enterotoxic protein gene , and absence of genes encoding , cytotoxin k , hemolysin ii  and hemolysin ii regulator , enterotoxic protein , phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c  and crystal proteins .

due to the inability to resolve the b. cereus, b. thuringiensis and b. weihenstephanensis based on the presence/absence of virulence genes, we further investigated the production of hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin and their association with wgs phylogenetic clades and sequence polymorphism on the  <dig> strains that were physically available for phenotypic tests. details of this analysis are discussed in the following sections.

presence of hblacd and nheabc is not sufficient for production of detectable hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin nhe
to assess the congruence of hblacd and nheabc presence with toxin production, and to identify gene polymorphisms responsible for potential inconsistencies, we examined the  <dig> dairy-associated b. cereus group isolates sequenced in this study, five b. thuringiensis reference isolates and b. cereus atcc  <dig>  for detectable levels of hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin nhe using duopath cereus enterotoxins kit . all tested isolates carried the nheabc genes, and all of them also produced the nhe toxin at detectable levels . in contrast, just  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates carried hblacd genes. hemolysin bl was detected in only  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates that had the hblacd genes present, and in none of the isolates that did not have hblacd. future studies assessing transcription of hblacd and using other phenotypic methods  will be needed to explain why some isolates that carry the hblacd do not express the hbl toxin.

previous studies have confirmed the presence of nheabc in  <dig> - <dig>  % b. cereus and b. thuringiensis isolates from korean white rice samples, but only  <dig>  % of them produced nhea  <cit> . the hblacd genes were present in  <dig> - <dig>  % of these white rice isolates; yet only  <dig>  % of them produced hblc  <cit> . reis et al.  <cit>  have reported  <dig> out of  <dig> isolated strains carrying all three hbl genes, but only  <dig> of these producing the hemolysin bl toxin. data from these studies, as well as the present study suggest that the presence of hblacd genes may not be sufficient for production of detectable hemolysin bl. the hemolysin bl toxin may not be detected because i) the hblc is not transcribed, ii) transcribed mrna is not translated, iii) protein is not exported, or iv) the protein was not in the configuration detectable by monoclonal antibody from duopath cereus enterotoxins kit. these results demonstrate that presence of hblacd genes alone does not predict the production of hemolysin bl, suggesting that it may not be possible to accurately predict the risk for a b. cereus group isolate to cause a diarrheal disease based on the gene presence alone.

isolates with a truncated hbla variant or specific amino acid substitutions in hblc or hbld genes do not express detectable hemolysin bl
in order to explain the discrepancies between hblabc gene presence and hemolysin bl production in five isolates , we have examined the hbl genes and individual gene amino acid sequence variability. the  <dig> aa long hblb gene  was not identified in two dairy-associated b. weihenstephanensis isolates  that carried hblacd genes, but did not produce detectable hemolysin bl. absence of hblb and presence of hblacd was also observed in b. weihenstephanensis kbab <dig>  b. cereus 17256 w and b. mycoides  <dig>  another b. weihenstephanensis isolate  carried all four hbl genes, including hbla and hblb. the hblb is located after the stem loop structure in hbl operon, which may regulate its co-transcription with the rest of the genes in the hbl operon  <cit> . the role of hblb is not well understood yet, however, a mutant lacking hbl-i operon has previously been demonstrated to be less cytotoxic compared to a wild type strain carrying both operons  <cit> . the three b. weihenstephanensis isolates that lacked hblb also had two unique 2-aa insertions  and a 2-aa deletion  in hbla. the fourth b. weihenstephanensis isolate , however, did not have these insertions or deletion in hbla. overall, these observations provide a possible mechanistic explanation  for why some b. weihenstephanensis may not show production of hemolysin bl detectable by the duopath kit. further studies, including creation of appropriate mutant strains, will be needed to provide more definitive insights.

specific hblacd mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions were observed in the dairy isolate fsl m8- <dig> and in b. thuringiensis bgsc 4y <dig>  which both carry the hblacd genes, but did not produce detectable hemolysin bl. for isolate fsl m8- <dig> the threonine at the 410th position of hblc  was substituted with alanine. the polar threonine is commonly found in catalytic sites; therefore its substitution with hydrophobic alanine may impact protein functionality  <cit> . similarly, a threonine at the 358th position of b. thuringiensis bgsc 4y <dig> hblc gene was replaced with an electrically charged lysine. a non-neutral substitution was also identified in hbld  of b. thuringiensis bgsc 4y <dig>  where a histidine at the 27th position was replaced with glutamine. the electrically charged histidine does not substitute well with any other amino acid and is often part of binding or active sites  <cit> . its replacement with polar glutamine may therefore affect the toxin assembly and activity. neither of these substitutions was observed in isolates producing detectable hemolysin bl toxin. single amino acid substitutions have been previously shown to abolish monoclonal antibody reactivity with toxin components in other organisms, such as b. anthracis  <cit> . substitutions in specific asparagine and proline residues of anthrax protective antigen have been demonstrated to reduce the cytotoxicity and antibody binding, while specific lysine, leucine and tyrosine residues have affected only the antibody binding  <cit> . it is not yet understood whether observed mutations abolish fully functioning toxin expression, or just its detection by the monoclonal antibodies used in duopath kit  <cit> . future studies are needed to address these questions in order to allow for sequence-based prediction of the toxicity associated with different hbl gene variants.

wgs clade iv is associated with hemolysin bl toxin production
isolates that were tested for toxin production were distributed among clades ii to vi. all tested isolates from clades iii-b, iii-c and vi did not produce a detectable hemolysin bl toxin. clades ii, iii-a and v all included isolates with and without production of hemolysin bl;  <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig> tested isolates, respectively, produced hemolysin bl. all tested isolates from phylogenetic clade iv tested positive for hemolysin bl production. hemolysin bl production was significantly  associated with this clade, which is consistent with a previous report  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
wgs-based phylogenetic classification of b. cereus group isolates showed better association with presence of toxin genes and toxin production than traditional taxonomic species classification. clade classification along with the identification of virulence gene presence/absence and allelic variation in hemolysin bl-encoding genes thus appears to provide for better characterization of isolates with regard to their likelihood of causing diarrheal foodborne and other diseases. overall, our findings support previous studies  that have emphasized the need to re-evaluate the taxonomy of the b. cereus group, specifically of the species b. cereus and b. thuringiensis, which both were found in multiple clades. in the meantime, our data support a previous proposal that b. cereus group isolate nomenclature should include species and phylogenetic clade. the clade classification can be achieved by wgs as well as rpob, panc or mlst sequencing, albeit at a lower level of phylogenetic resolution compared to wgs.
