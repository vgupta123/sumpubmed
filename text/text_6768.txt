BACKGROUND
it is estimated that approximately 70% of angiosperms have experienced one or more chromosome doubling events during their evolutionary history  <cit> . many crop species are also polyploid, including brassica napus , triticum aestivum , solanum tuberosum , gossypium hirsutum , avena sativa  and saccharum officinarum . brassica napus is an allopolyploid species originating from interspecific hybridization between diploid progenitors brassica oleracea and brassica rapa <cit> , which are themselves derived from ancient polyploidy events resulting in genome triplication  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . these recent and ancient polyploidy events resulted in numerous duplicated segments and homoeologous regions within the genome of b. napus <cit> . hence, discriminating between a) two homologous sequences and b) two nearly-identical homoeologous sequences is complex and difficult in b. napus <cit> .

snps  are single-nucleotide substitutions of one base for another in dna sequences. snps are quite abundant throughout the entire genome of most organisms and every snp in low copy dna is a potentially useful marker  <cit> . snp markers have been applied in studies of genetic variation, construction of genetic maps, population structure analysis, association genetics, map-based gene isolation, and other plant breeding applications  <cit> . in contrast to traditional snp detection techniques, detecting snps using next generation sequencing  technologies  is high-throughput, low cost and high efficiency. hence, next generation sequencing has been used in the development of thousands of molecular markers in many species , such as oryza sativa   <cit> , helianthus annuus   <cit> , zea mays l.   <cit> , triticum aestivum   <cit> , manihot esculenta   <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> . mass snp information has already been successfully used for genome-wide association studies , and snp markers are increasingly becoming the optimal marker system.

in recent years, many snps have been discovered in b. napus <cit>  and b. oleracea <cit> . however, these snps are inadequate for large-scale applications  <cit> . trick et al.  <cit>  used solexa sequencing to generate approximately  <dig> million expressed sequence tags  from two b. napus cultivars. they obtained  <dig> - <dig>   putative snps through alignment to a publicly available set of approximately  <dig>  brassica species unigenes  <cit> . however,  <dig> - <dig> % of the putative snps were ‘hemi-snps’, amplifying two or more different genomic loci. in comparison with ‘hemi-snps’, ‘simple snps’ are derived from allelic differences at a single genomic locus. similarly, bancroft et al.  <cit>  used transcriptome sequencing to construct two b. napus linkage maps from  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp markers, but discovered that the first map comprised  <dig>   hemi-snp types and only  <dig>   simple snp types, and that the second map comprised  <dig>  hemi-snps and only  <dig> simple snps  <cit> . later, bus et al.  <cit>  used eight different b. napus germplasm types to identify genome-wide restriction-site associated dna  fragments, and obtained over  <dig>  snps  <cit> . hence, usability and availability of snps in b. napus is still limited, and development of a large set of simple snp markers is highly desirable.

at present, both the a and c progenitor genomes  of b. napus have been sequenced. the b. rapa a genome was released in  <dig>  <cit> , and the b. oleracea c genome has been sequenced by a collaboration between the ocri  and other research communities and hence could also be used for blast analysis using the brad database  <cit>  , although the c genome sequences have not yet been released. based on these available reference sequences, large-scale identification of simple snps in b. napus could be implemented. the objective of the present study was to develop a set of genome-wide and evenly spaced snps through genome re-sequencing of ten b. napus varieties, and to validate the use of these snps on high-throughput genotyping platforms.

RESULTS
resequencing, snp calling and snp verification
samples for resequencing were chosen from b. napus accessions which were parents of reference mapping populations or elite cultivars. after removing low quality and contaminant sequences, a total of  <dig> million  paired-end reads of 75-bp or 100-bp read length  were retained. the sequencing depth for each variety averaged  <dig>  ×, ranging from  <dig>  × to  <dig>  × depth . all sequence reads were aligned against the reference b. rapa <cit>  and b. oleracea sequences using soap <dig>  prior to alignment, all reference sequences were masked for repetitive elements using a comprehensive brassica repetitive element database . this step served to minimize the data set to low-copy dna. snps were then extracted from soap <dig> alignments after a filtering scheme that  excluded  <dig> million reads with redundant hits to the reference genomes, retaining  <dig> million reads uniquely matched to the reference sequences;  excluded  <dig> million snps supported by less than four reads in each line ;  excluded  <dig> , <dig> snps that were heterozygous in at least in one individual and  excluded  <dig> , <dig> snps with a minor allele frequency more than  <dig> . after applying the filters described above, the total number of remaining snps was  <dig> , including  <dig>  bi-allelic snps and  <dig> tri-allelic snps. the snp flanking sequences and the mutated sites have been deposited in ncbi dbsnp databases   <cit> .table  <dig>

a and c genomes. the x axis represents the length of the chromosome while the y axis represents the number of snps present at that point on each chromosome.



to test empirically the quality of the snps identified between the ten b. napus accessions, ten random loci containing snps were validated by sequencing: pcr primers were designed from reference sequences and used to amplify dna fragments from the ten b. napus accessions. of  <dig> high-quality reads that aligned to reference sequence,  <dig> contained snps that matched the predicted results. hence, the predicted false positive rate of snp discovery was 7%.

non-synonymous snp identification and enrichment analysis
non-synonymous snps that lead to an amino acid change in the protein product are of major interest. non-synonymous variations are more likely to lead to functional mutations  which may further affect phenotype. a total of  <dig>  non-synonymous snps were identified and were located in  <dig>  predicted genes. a total of  <dig> non-synonymous snps transformed stop codons to amino acid codons, whereas  <dig> non-synonymous snps transformed amino acid codons to stop codons. go enrichment analysis predicted that the genes containing non-synonymous snps were involved in binding and catalytic activity more often than predicted by chance .figure  <dig>

high-throughput genotyping testing via the goldengate array
a total of  <dig> candidate snps were submitted to illumina inc. to evaluate the designability of these snps. the rank score ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> . fourteen snps with rank score  <dig>  or lower were excluded, and the remaining snps were included in the opa . the 96-plex opa included  <dig> a-genome snps and  <dig> c-genome snps that were evenly distributed genome-wide.

two mapping populations  comprising a total of  <dig> b. napus lines were genotyped using the goldengate assay. clustering of cy <dig> and cy <dig> normalized intensities in a polar coordinate plot was used to infer the snp genotypes. genotype calls for all snps could be grouped into one or more groups depending on whether a snp site was monomorphic or polymorphic. there were  <dig> snps which were polymorphic in at least one population. in the dh population, there were  <dig> polymorphic snps between the two parents. six of these  <dig> snps segregated in a 1: <dig> ratio . in the f <dig> population, there were  <dig> polymorphic snps between the two parents. twelve of these  <dig> snps segregated in a 1:2: <dig> ratio .

in order to evaluate the reproducibility of the snps, three repeats of one sample were conducted for all snp assays. of the  <dig> snps, only one snp showed variable results across the three repetitions. the average call rate was 92% for the  <dig> b. napus samples. in order to evaluate the reliability of the developed snps, the two populations were mixed and clustered with the genomestudio data analysis software. most snps were still clustered into three groups . there were only  <dig> snps which were clustered into four groups .figure  <dig>

discussion
large polyploid genomes such as b. napus and wheat present a challenge for snp discovery because of the presence of multiple homoeologous sequences  <cit> . allelic variants need to be distinguished from non-allelic  variants  which present as false snps. in addition, the repetitive nature of the polyploid genomes has been one of the major obstacles to snp discovery. in this study, three conditions were utilized to identify putative “simple snps”.

firstly, low-copy dna regions were identified by uniquely-aligned reads that were excluded from repetitive dna regions and mapped to only one place in the b. rapa and b. oleracea reference sequences. sequenced reads were classified into three categories: ‘uniquely aligned’, ‘repeatedly aligned’ and ‘unaligned’. here, the ‘repeatedly aligned’ category represents duplicated loci across the allopolyploid b. napus genome. the ‘unaligned’ category may be partially derived from novel sequences induced by such events as genome rearrangements or transposon activity. hence, only the uniquely aligned single-hit reads were selected from the aligned results for further analysis. secondly, only homozygous loci were selected for subsequent analysis in each individual. heterozygous loci could be unambiguously attributed to polymorphism between homoeologous chromosomes rather than to allelic heterozygosity. thirdly, only reads with depth ≥  <dig> were used for snp discovery, in order to exclude snps generated by sequencing error. generally speaking, minimum recommended read depth is ≥  <dig> per genotype  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  snp polymorphisms were identified among the ten accessions of b. napus, using a stringent filtering approach favouring high quality snps over exhaustive snp sampling to provide a resource of immediate value for crop improvement. therefore, the actual frequency of snp polymorphisms between these accessions is likely to have been underestimated, due to the stringent filtering methods used and due to exclusion of duplicated dna.

in the present study, approximately 55% of snps were distributed on the a genome, and 45% of snps were distributed on the c genome. however, bancroft et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> snps on the a genome and  <dig> snps on the c genome  <cit> : the bias towards a-genome snps was far more significant than in the present study. the genetic distance between the ningyou <dig> and tapidor c genomes is likely narrow, although these two genotypes were selected on the basis of their genetic dissimilarity, contrasting trait characteristics and different cultivation ranges  <cit> . however, the results of the present study agree that the a genome appears more variable than the c genome. uneven distribution of snps throughout the genome is common, and has also been observed in brassica relative arabidopsis thaliana <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  snps predicted to cause non-synonymous amino acid substitutions were identified in this study. these snps may represent causal genetic variation contributing to phenotype variation. using this snp set to perform genome-wide association in b. napus would be more efficient than using a general snp set to identify causal gene mutations. go analysis in the present study suggested that the genes predicted to contain non-synonymous snps were more commonly associated with binding and catalytic activity than with other functionality. this may suggest that proteins with the function of binding and catalytic activity may play a significant role in adaptive evolution.

a 96-snp goldengate assay can be used successfully for snp genotyping in b. napus, despite the high number of paralogous sequences in this polyploid species. figure  <dig> shows an example of a putative simple snp  in the two mapping populations. if the snp was a hemi-snp with one homozygous locus, the genotyped samples of mixed populations would cluster into four or more groups  <cit>  . in the present study, when the results from the two populations were pooled for snp chip analysis, only 3/ <dig>  of snps showed four genotype clusters, suggesting these were hemi-snps with genotype-specific heterozygosity in the additional amplified region. however, validating these snps over a wider range of accessions would be valuable in determining what proportion of snps are simple snps, and what proportion are hemi-snps.

although  <dig>  snps have been developed, there are still some limitations to this work. ten accessions was a productive number for the snp discovery. however, increasing the number of resequenced accessions will enhance efficient, polymorphic snp discovery. as well, eight of the accessions used were semi-winter-type b. napus, and therefore the effect of these snps in spring-type and winter-type b. napus needs to be further validated. ten snps were randomly selected for sequencing and validation in ten lines: 97% of the sequenced snp loci matched the prediction. the high validation ratio may have resulted from the stringent filtering conditions. ninety-six snps were tested on a genotyping platform, and most polymorphic snps showed segregation distortion. the segregation distortion may have resulted from selection bias for particular alleles during the process of population construction . it is also possible that for some of these snps genotyping using the goldengate assay resulted in theincorrect grouping of multiple genotype clusters together , which would result in distorted segregation ratios. however, multi-locus genotypes are usually clearly identifiable in genome studio by the presence of additional separate clusters, so it is more likely that the segregation distortion observed was due to selective pressure for one or the other parental allele under population growth conditions. future work could include validation of the genomic location of these snps by designing and using arrays in large mapping populations originating from diverse b. napus parent genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig>  bi-allelic snp markers were developed for allopolyploid b. napus. the average number of snps per 100 kb was  <dig> and  <dig> in the a genome and c genome respectively. transition-type snps accounted for  <dig> % of all snps, and transversion-type snps accounted for  <dig> %. a subset of developed snps was tested through sequencing of pcr amplification products and the goldengate genotyping technique, and it is predicted that the majority of the snps identified in this study  can be applied in the development of much larger arrays of informative snps, such as infinium ii assays.
