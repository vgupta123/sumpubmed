BACKGROUND
in the nuclear fusion of stars and sun, the elements were evolved from hydrogen  <cit> . during the process of evolution, the element calcium  was born by successive capture of α particle by oxygen and neon in the process of nuclear fusion  <cit> . after about  <dig> billion years, the cell membrane most likely shown its charged activity locally with relentless entropy  <cit> . to adapt to changing environment, cell must respond to changing environmental signals, and cellular signaling requires an efficient messenger that can move through all parts of the cell to decipher the message. calcium ion commonly fulfills this signaling role. the concentrations of signaling molecules vary in the cell with time and environmental conditions. the speed and effectiveness of the ca2+ ion is  <dig>  fold higher in the intracellular  compartment than the extracellular  compartment  <cit> . cells use a great deal of energy to induce changes in ca2+ concentration and stabilize the cell. the concentration of mg2+, which is popularly known as a cousin of ca2+ doesn’t differ greatly across the cellular compartments. then question arises, why the concentration of ca2+ is very less in the cytosol? this is because mg2+ binds the cytosolic water molecules less efficiently than phosphates. therefore, if there will be higher ca2+ concentrations in the cytosol, ca2+ will bind with phosphate and thus turning the cell into a bone like structure. unlike other complex molecules, ca2+ cannot be altered chemically. therefore, it is necessary to control the cytosolic ca2+ concentration to avoid any precipitation with the phosphate in the cytosol. hence, cells have developed necessary cellular mechanisms to control the cytosolic ca2+ concentration by chelating, compartmentalizing or extruding the ion from the cell. hence hundreds of proteins have evolved to bind the ca2+ ion over a million-fold range of affinities  to buffer or lower ca2+ level in the cell. one of the most important protein chelators of ca2+ ion is the ef-hand domain containing proteins. there are hundreds of ef-hand containing proteins present in the plants. these proteins are found as family proteins. some of the important ef-hand domain containing families of proteins are calcium dependent protein kinase   <cit> , calcium dependent protein kinase related kinase   <cit> , calcineurin-b like   <cit> , calmodulin  and calmodulin like  protein  <cit> . the cdpk contains the kinase domain, auto-inhibitory domain and a regulatory domain that contains four calcium binding ef-hands while crk contains kinase domain, auto-inhibitory domain and a regulatory domain that contain only three calcium binding ef-hands. additionally, the cbl contains only three ef-hands and no kinase domain while cam and cml contain only four ef-hands and lack a kinase domain  <cit> . the calcium ion binds to the asp  or glu  amino acids of the ef-hands. the d and e amino acids in the ef-hands are reported to be conserved and present as d-x-d or d/e-e-l motif  <cit> . the d-x-d motifs are conserved at  <dig>   <dig> and 16th position of the ef-hands  <cit> . detailed investigations of different genomics and evolutionary aspects of the cdpk and cbl protein family have been discussed recently  <cit> . however, there have been only little information is available regarding the detail study of cam and cml gene family in the plants. therefore in this study, we conducted genome-wide identification of cam and cml gene family members in plants and analyzed their genomic and evolutionary aspects. along with the reports of cdpk and cbl protein family, this study completely unveils the genomic aspects of calcium signaling events in plants and calcium signature motifs in ef-hand domains.

the average number of cams in plant was found to be  <dig>  per genome and the majority of the plants encode less than  <dig> cams in its genome. the size of plant genome vary from species to species, and these variations are completely depends on the ploidy and duplication events of the genome. however, the variations in the number of genes in a gene family were not directly correlated with the genome size, ploidy or genome duplication events of an organism. the correlation regression analysis of cams and cmls with respect to genome size has shown that they are not correlated . the correlation coefficient of cam was r =  <dig>  and that of cml was r =  <dig> . the tetraploid species glycine max and panicum virgatum encoded eight and nine cams respectively which is less than the cams of the diploid species b. rapa and m. guttatus . the normal distribution analysis shows, the probability of genome that can encode cams more than once was  <dig>   . similarly, the probability to encode more than  <dig> cam in a genome was only  <dig>  . the details regarding the probability of distribution of cam among different groups of organisms in plant lineage are mentioned in table  <dig>  these findings show that the presence and distribution of varied gene number and type of gene in a genome is dependent on the evolutionary pressure, it functional requirements and complexities of the plant. two sample t-tests between cml and cam were conducted and the mean of cml and cam was found to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . the t-value of unpaired and paired t-test was found to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.fig.  <dig> regression analyses of number of cam and cml genes in different genomes. a correlation regression of cam gene number in different genomes. most of the genome encodes four to ten cam genes. the increase in the genome size is not related to the increase in number of cam genes in the genome. the correlation coefficient of the analysis was r =  <dig> . b correlation regression analysis of cml genes. similar to the cam gene family, the number of cml genes in a genome does not increase with increase with genome size. the correlation coefficient of cml was r =  <dig> 



group  <dig> indicates cmls and group  <dig> indicates cams. different parameters used to run the statistical analysis was as follows: group description, groups have unequal variance; number of tails, two tailed test; significance level ,  <dig> ; test, unpaired and paired t-test. in the table n signifies number of samples. in both the paired and unpaired test, group  <dig> and  <dig> are significantly different at p <  <dig> 




genome-wide analysis of the cml gene family in plants showed that the green algae c. subellipsoidea, o. lucimarinus, and c. reinhardtii encoded lower numbers of cmls than the higher plants . the genome of c. subellipsoidea and o. lucimarinus encoded only three and two cams, respectively. these two species encoded the same number of cmls, whereas c. reinhardtii encoded six cams and three cmls respectively. c. reinhardtii encoded more cams  than cmls . conversely, o. lucimarinus encoded equal numbers of cams and cmls . when compared with o. lucimarinus, v. carteri was also found to contain similar numbers of cams and cmls  . a. thaliana encoded maximum of  <dig> cml genes while b. rapa encoded  <dig> cmls. the tetraploid species g. max and p. virgatum encoded  <dig> and  <dig> cmls respectively. the monocot plant o. sativa encoded  <dig>  while s. bicolor and p. hallii encoded  <dig> cmls. on the other hand, p. patens, and s. italica encoded  <dig> cmls each. c. clementina, f. vesca, and m. guttatus encoded 19; a. coerulea, c. sativus, l. usitatissimum, p. persica, and z. mays encoded  <dig> cmls each. g. max, s. lycopersicum, s. tuberosum, and t. halophila encoded  <dig> cmls each. this distribution of the cml gene family shows, several plant species has encoded the same numbers of cml genes while other do not. the percentage analysis comparison between cam and cml shows, t. cacao encoded 700% and o. sativa 660% more cmls compared to their counterpart cams . the normal distribution study shows, the probability of occurrence of more than two cmls in a plant genome was  <dig>   while the probability of occurrence of more than  <dig> cmls was  <dig>   only . the details about the probability of distribution of the cmls among different groups are mentioned in table  <dig>  the student’s t-test was conducted to understand the significance of differences between gene numbers present between cam and cml gene family. both unpaired and paired t-test analysis shows cam and cml gene family group members were significantly different from each other . these changes in gene family size and unequal distribution of cams and cmls may be attributed to their ploidy level and different cellular processes require for different plants  <cit> , but they were not related to the size of the genome . because in principle, addition or evolution of more genes or genomic content within the genome will lead to increase in the genome size, but vice versa  is not true. this might have occurred because of the different cellular and ecological strategies associated with adaptation and expansion of the gene family . the variations in the gene family size were largely attributed to the important mechanisms that shape natural variation and adaptation in different species  <cit> .

cmls and cams contain varied numbers of introns
genome-wide analysis of the cml gene family in plants revealed that larger parts of the cmls were intronless. among the studied  <dig> cmls of  <dig> species,  <dig> genes  were identified to be intronless  whereas  <dig> had one intron ,  <dig> had two introns ,  <dig> had three introns ,  <dig> had four introns , and  <dig> had five introns . only a few cmls contained six, seven, eight or nine introns, and none of them were found to contain ten or more than ten introns . in opposite to cmls, the majorities of cams were contained introns. among the studied  <dig> cams of  <dig> species,  <dig>  were found to be intronless,  <dig>  contained one,  <dig>  contained two,  <dig>  contained three, six  contained  <dig>  five  contained five, and seven  contained six introns respectively. the evolutionary perspectives regarding the presence of introns in eukaryotic protein coding genes are not yet clear. however, mattic  <cit>  reported that introns can function as a transposable element and nuclear introns has originated from the self splicing group ii introns, which later evolved in conjunction with the spliceosome. it assumed that these introns were evolve after divergence from the prokaryotes and later established in the eukaryotic genome with new genetic space and function, which provided a positive pressure for their expansion  <cit> . according to this concept, it can be speculated that the majority of cmls were intronless and can therefore be considered older than cams. a few cmls contains introns in their genes, and it is believed that these introns were evolved recently with cams. this explains why the intron containing cmls contains only one  intron in their gene. similarly, a few cams were also intronless , which indicates that the genome has yet to incorporate the introns into the cams. some other cams contains either one , two  or three  introns. this could be possible because these introns were might have added recently and the genome did not got ample time to add more introns into the cams. similarly, the introns present in cmls are assumed to have been added recently. it requires sufficient time to carry out a major evolutionary event and the addition of more introns into a gene.

according to the intron late hypothesis, introns are the eukaryotic novelty and new introns are emerging continuously during the evolution of eukaryotic genome  <cit> . different genes in eukaryotic organisms differ dramatically in terms of density and size distribution. in some cases, zero to six introns per kilobase were observed in the eukaryotic genome  <cit> . comparative analysis of exon-intron structures of orthologous genes in higher eukaryotic organisms revealed that they share approximately 25% to 30% of the introns  <cit> . the presence of  <dig> % intronless genes in cmls shows that the cmls of plants are highly orthologous and conserved genes in the plant kingdom that evolved from a common ancestor. similarly, the presence of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % similarity for one, two and three introns containing genes, respectively, shows their close homology with orthologous genes. intron loss events dominate the short evolutionary distances, whereas intron gain accompanies important evolutionary transitions. intron gain is an ongoing process, and a high rate of intron gain has been reported for paralogous genes in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa . the shared introns were likely derived from a common ancestor of the corresponding species, while the lineage-specific introns were introduced into the genes at the subsequent stages of evolution.

cam contains four d-x-d motifs and cml contains one d-x-d-x-d motif in their ef-hands
cams and cmls are evolutionarily conserved gene families of plants, therefore it was very important to understand their conserved domains and motifs. hence, we conducted multiple sequence alignment of cams and cmls protein sequences separately to identify the conserved domains and motifs. multiple sequence alignment has revealed the presence of several conserved domains and motifs. the cam protein contains four calcium binding ef-hands . multiple sequence alignment of cams revealed the presence of four d-x-d motifs in four ef-hand domains . each ef-hand domain contains one d-x-d motif and the motif was conserved at position 14th, and 16th in all of the ef-hands. in addition to the presence of a d-x-d motif in the ef-hands, the first ef-hand contains a conserved e-x2-e motif that conserved at 5th, and 8th position. besides this it was found to contain a conserved e amino acid at position 25th of the 1st ef-hand . the second ef-hand contained a conserved e amino acids at positions 5th and 12th, respectively; a conserved d-f-x-e-f domain at the position 22nd, 23rd, 25th and 26th, respectively and a conserved d amino acid at position 36th . the third ef-hand contained conserved d and e amino acids at the 1st, and 8th position respectively, and conserved e amino acids at position 25th and 36th. the fourth ef-hand contained conserved e amino acids at the 4th, 5th, 12th and 25th position. a conserved e amino acid was found to present at 5th position in the first, second and fourth ef-hand. similarly, a conserved e amino acid was also found to present at position 25th in all four ef-hands . the first and fourth ef-hands contain no conserved amino acids at the 36th position, while the second and third ef-hands contained a conserved d and e amino acid respectively the 36th position respectively.fig.  <dig> three dimensional structure of cam protein.  secondary structure of the cam protein where calcium ligand was found to bind the n- and c-terminal end of the ef-hands. four calcium ligands bind to the four ef-hands.  the cavity model of cam and calcium ligands shown in green,  ligands and pockets in cavity model,  distribution of acidic amino acids in cam,  molecular structure  van der waals surface, and  dot surface. the protein sequence of arabidopsis thaliana atcam <dig> was used as a query sequence to model the figure. the protein model was created using geno3d software


fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of cam protein sequences. the sequence alignment shows presence of four conserved d-x-d motifs, one in each ef hand. the d-x-d motif was conserved at positions  <dig>  and  <dig> in each ef-hand. in addition to the presence of conserved d-x-d motifs in the ef-hands, cams were also contained several conserved d  and e  amino acids in each ef-hand. the d and e amino acids are prominent calcium sensors that bind calcium ions in the ef-hands. therefore, cam contains several conserved d and e amino acids in the ef-hands to increase the calcium binding affinity. multiple sequence alignment was conducted using multalin software




unlike the cams, cmls were also found to contain four calcium binding ef-hand domains . each ef-hand is around  <dig> amino acids long and contains a conserved aspartate  and glutamate  amino acid in the ef-hands. the ef-hand has a helix-loop-helix structure that coordinates the calcium ion. multiple sequence alignment of cmls shows the presence of a conserved d-x-d-x-d motif in the fourth ef-hand  that is conserved at 14th, 16th, and 18th position. no other ef-hands were found to contain conserved d-x-d motifs. instead, they contain some other conserved amino acid at different positions. the first ef-hand contained conserved f-x2-f motif at the 5th and 8th position and a calcium binding d-x3-d motif at 9th and 13th position. glycine  was found to conserve at position 14th and glutamate  was conserved at position 20th in the first ef-hand. unlike the first ef-hand, the second ef-hand was also contained a conserved d-x3-d motif at the 13th and 17th position. glycine was found to conserve at position 18th and e and f were conserved at position 24th and 25th, respectively, in the second ef-hand. in the third ef-hand, f was conserved at position 10th, while d and e were conserved at positions 14th and 25th respectively. in addition to the presence of a d-x-d-x-d motif in the fourth ef-hand, it was also found to contain a conserved f-x-e-f domain. the calcium sensor protein, calcium dependent protein kinase  contains a kinase domain and four calcium binding ef-hands. the ef-hand domain of cpk contains conserved d-x-d motifs in each ef-hand. the d-x-d motifs in the ef-hands of cpks are conserved at positions 14th, 15th and 16th similar to the d-x-d motifs of cams. the d-x-d-x-d motif of cml was conserved at 14th, 16th, and 18th position of the ef-hand. the molecular structure of cml also revealed about the presence of only two calcium binding ligand pockets in the c-terminal region of the ef-hand . these finding indicated that, the fourth ef-hand of cml present in the c-terminal region is more functional than the other three ef-hands. the two ef-hands of the n-terminal region and the first ef-hand of the c-terminal region  don’t have any calcium binding ligand pockets. this may be the reason that cmls might have undergone evolutionary changes to modified to cams and to add four calcium sensing d-x-d motif in it and hence they contain introns in the cam gene. although the d-x-d motifs were conserved at similar positions in the cam and cpks, only the cml contains the d-x-d-x-d motif in the fourth ef-hand while cam contains the d-x-d motif in all four ef-hands. these findings show that the ef-hands present in cpks are much similar to cams than that of cmls. the presence of four ef-hand domains in cmls, similar to that of cams and cpks as well as the absence of a conserved d-x-d motif from all ef-hand domains of cml shows that they have developed recently and have yet to gain complete structural conservation unlike cam and cpk.fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of cml protein sequences. the sequence alignment shows presence of the d-x-d-x-d motif in the fourth ef-hand. the d-x-d-x-d motif was conserved at 14th, 16th, and 18th position. in addition to the presence of a conserved d-x-d-x-d motif, cml also found to contain several conserved d and e amino acids in other ef-hands. the multiple sequence alignment was conducted using the multalin software

cml contain signal sequences while cam do not
proteomes are larger and more dynamic than genomes because of the presence of abundant alternative splicing of genes and expanded functional and chemical complexities at the protein level due to post-translational modifications. this explains to some extent why larger genomes do not automatically translate into more complex organisms. post-translational modifications lead to incorporation of new chemistry and molecular functions that cannot be precisely encoded by gene sequences. the posttranslational modifications event including myristoylation and palmitoylation have incredibly diverse biological functions in signaling, protein trafficking, localization, extracellular communication, protein regulation and metabolism. co-translational and irreversible addition of myristic acid to n-terminal glycine residues are known as myristoylation. the n-terminal glycine residues that undergo protein myristoylation are usually conserved at the second position in the n-terminal region. therefore, we analyzed about the presence of putative myristoylation and palmitoylation sites in cams and cmls using css palm software version  <dig> . our analysis revealed that the cams do not contain any palmitoylation or myristoylation sites. however, myristoylation sites were predicted in few cmls  . approximately  <dig>  of the  <dig> studied cmls were found to contain glycine  amino acid residue at the second position of n-terminal end. the myristoylation motif found in cmls were m-g-f, m-g-g and m-g-x  where g amino acid was found at the 2nd position of the n-terminal end. the cpks were also reported to contain conserved myristoylation motif including m-g-c, and m-g-n at the n-terminal end  <cit> . although the g amino acid was conserved at the second position in cml and cam, the third position was dynamic. the palmitoylation and myristoylation events are sometimes correlated, and the absence of myristoylation may abolish the palmitoylation. when myristoylation of oscpk <dig> was abolished by removing the n-terminal g amino acid, the protein could no longer be palmitoylated  <cit> . these finding indicated that the myristoylation event is pre-requisite to palmitoylation. the absence of a myristoylation and palmitoylation site in cam likely forced it to merged with the kinase domain resulting in evolution of cpk that contains palmitoylation and myristoylation site in the n-terminal region. similarly, the presence of myristoylation sites in a few cmls shows that the palmitoylation site has evolved recently in these proteins. although the myristoylation has been shown to be pre-requisite to palmitoylation the same is not true for myristoylation. the myristoylation event might have occur independently without the requirement of a palmitoylation site. this is because neither cam nor cml were found to contain any palmitoylation sites.fig.  <dig> myristoylation site of cmls. the cmls were found to contain putative myristoylation sites in the n-terminal end. glycine amino acid, which undergoes myristoylation, was conserved at 2nd position in the n-terminal end. approximately  <dig> % of the cmls were found to contain putative myristoylation sites




cmls were evolved earlier than the cams
phylogenetic trees were constructed to understand the evolution of cams and cmls. the phylogenetic tree was constructed by taking the protein sequences of cams resulted in a single monophyletic clades with different groups and shows that they have evolved from a common ancestor of lower eukaryotic plants lineages . we named them as group i , ii , iii , iv , v , vi , vii , viii , ix  and x . the majorities of cams were clustered in group i , ii , iii , viii  and ix . the cam group of ostreococus, micromonas, selaginella, volvox, chlamydomonas and picea forms the basal root of the phylogenetic tree. these finding show the that plant cams were evolved from their common ancestor of basal lower eukaryotic lineages. construction of phylogenetic trees by taking protein sequences of cmls revealed presence of eight monophyletic groups . we named them as group i , ii , iii , iv , v , vi , vii  and viii  . the cmls of lower eukaryotes forms the basal root of the phylogenetic tree. these finding show that cmls were also evolved from common ancestors of basal lower eukaryotic lineages. both the results show that, cams and cmls were evolved from their common ancestor. as both the cams and cmls were evolved from a common ancestor and contain four calcium binding ef-hands, it was very important to determine if cams and cmls were coevolved. therefore, we took the protein sequences of cams and cmls together and constructed a phylogenetic tree . the phylogenetic tree revealed the presence of six monophyletic groups with cams and cmls analysis . we named them as group i , ii , iii , iv , v  and vi  . the cams and cmls of lower eukaryotic plants forms the basal root of the phylogenetic tree which reflects that both cam and cmls were evolved from basal lower eukaryotes together. the monophyletic clades of cams and cmls were shared by each other. in the phylogenetic tree, part of the cml group is dominated  . these finding indicate that these cmls were evolved recently by duplication and got diversified. the cams and cmls show that they have evolved together from their common ancestors and cmls were found to be older than cams. this is why, during the evolution process, eucalyptus grandis did able to acquire only one cams in its genome. the species tree of studied species shows that, the higher plants were evolved from their basal ancestors of lower eukaryotic lineage . to understand the rate of evolution of cam and cml, evolutionary rate was studied by estimating gamma parameters for site rates . for cams, substitution pattern and rates were estimated under the jones-taylor-thornton model   <cit> . a discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate among differences sites . mean evolutionary rates for cam in these categories were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  substitutions per site. the amino acid frequencies were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % . the maximum log likelihood for this computation was − <dig>  and the analysis involved  <dig> amino acid sequences. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset. the mean evolutionary rates for cmls were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  substitutions per site. the amino acid frequencies were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % . the maximum log likelihood for this computation was − <dig> . the analysis involved  <dig> amino acid sequences. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset. in both the cases, all positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. that is, fewer than 5% alignment gaps, and missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position. result shows that the substitution rates of cams are higher than those of cmls.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of cams. the phylogenetic tree shows presence of ten monophyletic groups of cam. the cams of the lower eukaryotic plants were found at the base of the phylogenetic tree, indicating that the cams of higher plants were evolved from the common ancestor of basal lower eukaryotic lineage. the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the protein sequences of cams using the mega <dig> software

cam and cmls are differentially expressed in different tissues

cam and cmls were reportedly involved in diverse cellular process including signaling and different biotic and abiotic stress responses. different stress responses have varying effects on different parts of the plant. therefore, tissue specific expressions of the genes also have a large impact in regulating stress conditions. the presence of tissue specific expression data in the phytozome database led us to analyze the expression data of cams and cmls of g. max and p. vulgaris. the data revealed that the relative abundance of gmcam <dig> and gmcam8- <dig> were higher in all the studied tissues  compared to the rest of gmcams . the maximum abundance of gmcam <dig> was found to be  <dig>  in nodules and  <dig>  in stems respectibely. similarly, the maximum abundance of gmcam8- <dig> was found to be  <dig>  in leaves and  <dig>  in roots respectively followed by gmcam9- <dig> which was also relatively highly expressed in roots . the expression of gmcam9- <dig> and gmcam9- <dig> was not found in other tissues except the roots. the expressions of maximum pvulcams genes of p. vulgaris were observed in all tissues except the pvulcam9- <dig>  the abundance of pvulcam <dig> was higher than others in all the tissues. the pvulcam7- <dig> and pvulcam7- <dig> were highly expressed in all tissues, but to a lesser extent than the pvulcam <dig> . although other pvulcams were expressed in all tissues, their expression level was comparatively lower than that of pvulcam <dig>  pvulcam7- <dig>  and pvulcam7- <dig>  overall the result shows that, cam <dig> was highly expressed in all tissues in g. max and p. vulgaris, while gmcam8- <dig> was highly expressed in roots. similarly, the pvulcam7- <dig> and pvulcam7- <dig> were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues.table  <dig> tissue specific expression of cam gene family of glycine max and phaseolus vulgaris. all the expression data are presented as fpkm

compared to the cam, cmls were expressed relatively at lower levels in different tissues . the gmcml <dig> was found to be highly expressed in nodules  and flowers , while gmcml3- <dig> was highly expressed in pods , nodules , stems , and roots  . the gmcml5- <dig> was highly expressed in stems and flowers while gmcml3- <dig> and gmcml3- <dig> were not expressed in pods, nodules, flowers, or leaves. similarly, gmcml15- <dig> and gmcml15- <dig> were not expressed in pods, nodules, flowers, stems, leaves or roots . the gmcml15- <dig> was found to be slightly expressed in nodules, flowers, stems, leaves and roots whereas gmcml <dig> was not expressed in leaves, while it was slightly expressed in other tissues. additionally, gmcml <dig> was also found to be not expressed in flowers while slightly expressed in other tissues. similarly, the gmcml <dig> was not expressed in pods and slightly expressed in other tissues.table  <dig> tissue specific expression of cml gene family of glycine max and phaseolus vulgaris. all the expression data are presented as fpkm

when compared to pvulcams, pvulcmls were also expressed at relatively lower levels. the pvulcml3- <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in pods , nodules , flowers , stems , leaves , and roots   while pvulcml3- <dig> was found to be expressed significantly higher in nodules , flowers , stems , leaves  and roots , but expressed to a lesser extent than that of pvulcml3- <dig>  the pvulcml38- <dig> was highly expressed in pods  and roots  followed by expression of pvulcml25- <dig> in pods , flowers , stems , and roots  . the pvulcml <dig> was highly expressed in pods , nodules , flowers , stems , leaves  and roots  while pvulcml3- <dig> was not expressed in pods, nodules, stems, leaves and roots but it was relatively highly expressed in flowers  . similarly, pvulcml <dig> was not expressed in pods, nodules, stems, leaves and roots while relatively highly expressed in flowers . investigations of the expression of g. max and p. vulgaris cmls revealed that, cml <dig> and cml  <dig> were expressed in all tissues in both the plants, while cml3- <dig>  and cml <dig>  were not expressed in any of the plants.

CONCLUSIONS
the cam and cml gene family from  <dig> plant species were studied. study shows the presence of four calcium binding d-x-d motifs in cam and one d-x-d-x-d motif in cmls. the number of family members of cam and cmls gene family vary significantly and do not correlate to the genome size of the organism. the evolutionary study shows, cmls were evolved earlier than cams and diversified later. tissue specific expression of cam and cml shows, these genes plays important role in development of different tissues in g. max and p. vulgaris.
