BACKGROUND
ten years after the first plant genome sequence was completed  <cit> , dozens more have been sequenced but to date no effort has been made to sequence the genome of a gymnosperm species. with 110- <dig> species spread throughout the northern hemisphere, the pines  comprise the largest genus in the coniferous family pinaceae of the gymnosperms. known for their longevity and important ecological roles, pines have also undergone 200- <dig> million years of evolution separate from their distant angiosperm relatives  <cit> . a pine genome reference sequence would fill a great evolutionary gap, but it has long been questioned whether such an endeavor was even feasible.

pine genomes are extremely large   <cit> . these genomes, however, show no evidence of recent polyploidy or chromosome duplication  <cit> . pine chromosomes  are uniform in both number  and appearance, for they lack major distinguishing physical features  <cit> . they are also so large and dense that standard karyotyping probes such as rdna, gc-rich and telomeric repeat sequences failed to produce differential banding patterns among the chromosomes and have complicated karyotyping efforts  <cit> . pine chromosomes have arabidopsis-type  telomere repeat sequences  at their terminal telomeres, as well as substantial centromeric and interstitial sites  <cit> . a reference karyotype and cytogenetic map was recently produced for pinus taeda l. with improved chromosome spreading techniques and staining probes for two types of rdna, the a-type trs and centromeric at-rich regions  <cit> . a leading commercial timber species native to the southeast united states, p. taeda is among the best-characterized pine genomes. there are currently a total of  <dig> p. taeda expressed sequence tags  in ncbi databases, the results of at least five major sequencing projects in root, needle, lignifying and embryonic tissues under varying conditions. these est sequences were subsequently clustered into  <dig> p. taeda unigenes  <cit> . the current genetic map includes  <dig> markers across twelve linkage groups  <cit> . thus, p. taeda is ideal for additional genomic exploration among pines, conifers and gymnosperms.

several studies report on the complexity of the pine genome. a reassociation study estimated that the pinus strobus l. genome contained 22-26% single-copy elements  <cit> . when the reassociation calculations were performed with a more accurate genome size estimate, single-copy sequences were estimated to occupy 14% of the genome, or  <dig> mb  <cit> . this very large single-copy fraction could be due to the presence of large complex gene families in pines, as was evidenced by southern hybridizations performed on p. taeda using single-to low-copy gene probes from angiosperms  <cit> . additionally, the single-copy fraction of the pine genome is enriched for repeats, as it was later shown that at least one fifth of low-copy sequences in p. taeda are retroelements and one third contain microsatellite repeats  <cit> .

genomic exploration in conifers has not been limited to pines. picea  is the most closely related genus to pinus and contains 30- <dig> species with genome sizes similar to pines. recent assembly and analysis of four bacterial artificial chromosome  sequences in picea glauca  voss revealed that only one targeted gene was present in each bac assembly, despite averaging nearly  <dig> kb in length  <cit> . assessment of the surrounding noncoding regions for similarity to repeat database elements revealed that high-complexity repeats comprise 22% and 18% of the two bac assemblies, where authors noted a prevalence of retroelement-based elements in the results  <cit> . repetitive content is thought to be similar in spruces and pines, but there are currently no comparable bac resources for pine. while a bac library has been reported for pinus pinaster ait., no bac-length sequences have been published for that species  <cit> .

presented here is the first large-scale sequence survey of a pine genome. this study produced the annotated sequences of ten p. taeda bacs using standard sanger sequencing and assembly methods, as well as  <dig>  gigabases of the genome in whole genome shotgun  sequences from the genome analyzer ii platform. the linear organization of coding and repetitive elements in ten contiguous genomic sequences is presented visually through computational annotation, similarity to repeat database elements, and several additional innovative repeat analyses. by aligning the wgs reads to the bac sequences, variation in whole-genome coverage based on alignment stringency is shown. the wgs sequences produced evidence that the three most common repetitive elements in the pine genome together constitute less than 5% of the sequence, and that there appears to be a large number of previously unknown repeat families. while the pine genome is largely repetitive, most of the repeats are highly diverged from one another. therefore, the main barrier to assembling the nuclear pine genome is not the content of the genome, but the cost associated with its large size.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
ten p. taeda bac clones were sequenced to an average depth of 10× coverage and assembled into contigs . for ease of presentation, each bac clone will be referenced by its lab designation, given in the leftmost column of table  <dig>  among the sequenced clones, coverage ranged from 6×  to over 16× . nine assemblies were resolved into one scaffold that contains linkers and spacers as necessary, while bac <dig> assembled into two unoriented contigs. the bac sequences were deposited in genbank . three sets of whole genome shotgun sequencing were performed with read lengths of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp. these sets of wgs reads were deposited in the short read archive and assigned accessions srx <dig>  srx <dig> and srx <dig>  respectively. the gc content of the bacs is similar to the shotgun reads, and the gc content of the p. taeda genome falls within typical ranges of angiosperm species . the first bac sequenced, bac <dig>  is visualized in figure  <dig>  all ten bacs, their predicted genes and all repeat analyses are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> or at http://dendrome.ucdavis.edu/treegenes/gbrowse.

**bac coverage was calculated by dividing the total number of p <dig> bases by the total amount of pine sequence in each scaffold assembly. genomic coverage of wgs reads was determined by dividing the total base pairs by the genome size,  <dig> e <dig> bp.

gene content
the bac library was probed for sequences similar to ten p. taeda genes known to be involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and lignin biosynthesis . the probes were derived from est contigs amplified from genomic dna and either differ significantly from the published mrna or lack corresponding mrna sequence altogether. the bacs contained thirteen regions with similarity to six probes; cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase , caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase , caffeate o-methyltransferase , lim transcription factor  <dig>  s-adenosyl methionine synthetase  <dig>  and s-adenosyl methionine synthetase  <dig>  . the regions of similarity with these genes averaged  <dig> bp with 87% nucleotide identity. four probes did not significantly match any bac sequence. based on 100% nucleotide identity with its probe, it appears that a novel ccoaomt may have been captured in bac <dig>  the other nine bacs contained regions with partial similarity to the probes. in order to determine the coding potential of these regions and to discover untargeted genes in the bacs, the maker automated annotation software was run with both dicot and monocot parameters   <cit> . the runs indicate that approximately 1% of the sequence in these bac clones may be protein-coding. eight of the ten bacs contain predicted genes, while bac <dig> and bac <dig> contain no predicted genes. the two runs produced similar results, with dicot and monocot genes occupying the same or overlapping regions, but exon-intron structure generally differed between the two runs . on average, the dicot-like genes occupy less genomic space but produce longer mrnas and peptides than the monocot-derived genes. the dicot-like genes contained an average of  <dig>  exons  and the monocot-like genes showed an average of  <dig>  exons . both runs predicted four small introns per gene, with average lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the dicot run predicted a total of  <dig> genes, two of which lack consensus start or stop codons . the monocot run also predicted  <dig> genes but seven genes lack consensus start or stop codons, making them gene fragments. all gene predictions employ consensus splice signals at exon-intron junctions. fourteen of the  <dig> total predicted genes were annotated against protein or nucleotide genes sequences from organisms other than p. taeda. the results of the maker runs, including gene annotations and supporting evidence, can be viewed in additional file <dig>  figure s <dig>

of the  <dig> predicted genes, twelve have similarities to interpro domains  <cit>  with an e-value < 1e- <dig> . the putative ccoaomt gene on bac <dig> is only one of several genes that, if they function as predicted, could be homologues to genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. two additional ccoaomt genes , three comt genes , a lim transcription factor , and one sam <dig>  are predicted in regions of similarity to their probes . the set of predicted genes also includes untargeted genes such as a member of the 4cl family , a glycosyl transferase gene , a smarca <dig> helicase , three kinases  and a reverse transcriptase that likely belongs to a transposon . three predicted genes do not show any similarity to interpro . analysis of upstream promoter regions shows that while most of these twelve genes do contain promoter elements, many of the predicted genes lack appropriately located tata or caat boxes that are generally required for transcription . based on the presence of consensus start and stop codons, significant interpro hits, and > 97% nucleotide identity with p. taeda ests, only three methyltransferases  may be novel protein-coding genes. the other  <dig> predicted genes are most likely inactive pseudogenes.

repeat content
as can be seen in additional figure  <dig>  the noncoding component of the ten pine bacs is composed of highly diverse repetitive elements. the maker output reports that bacs showed similarity to nearly  <dig> complex repbase elements in less than one megabase of pine genomic sequence  <cit>  . these include simple sequence repeats such as gc-and at-rich areas and complex repeats such as ltr and non-ltr retrotransposons, dna transposons , endogenous retroviruses , and other repetitive elements as defined by repbase. the sources of the accessions with similarity to the pine bacs vary widely, including five gymnosperm species,  <dig> dicot and eight monocot species,  <dig> animals, three fungal species, a moss and one multicellular alga. only 4% of all hits to complex repbase repeats are to gymnosperm-derived repetitive elements, reflecting the relative lack of genomic resources for this clade.

conifer-specific ltr retroelements
similarity to gymnosperm accessions was used to identify conifer-specific ltr retroelements in the bacs. the ifg <dig> gypsy-like retroelement in pinus radiata d. don  and pprt <dig> in p. pinaster aiton  are known to be pervasive in the pine family  <cit> , and four p. taeda bacs show strong similarity  to ifg <dig> . these four ifg7-like sequences are over 90% similar to each other, so they represent four partial copies of a novel p. taeda equivalent to ifg <dig> that is designated ptifg <dig> . the high level of sequence conservation suggests that the retroelement may be relatively young and still active. the fact that ptifg <dig> is actively transcribed is further supported by the fact that wgs coverage of the ptifg <dig> elements is similar at 75% and 99% identity  and, ultimately, that the sequence shows 100% nucleotide identity with at least seven p. taeda ests. note that while ptifg <dig> is present in four bacs, they are each interrupted by other elements or truncated by the end of the bac assembly .

in bac <dig>  a nearly full-length match to ptifg <dig> shows only 66-73% nucleotide identity. the region is flanked by 94% similar direct repeats and also contains  <dig> bp similar to the gypsy <dig> element in vitis vinifera l. neither the ltrs nor vvgypsy <dig> are similar to ptifg <dig>  this novel relative of ptifg <dig> is tentatively described as ptifg7- <dig>  as can be seen in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the ltrs of the putative ptifg7- <dig> in bac <dig> are tightly flanked by large  similarity hits to copia-like elements from medicago truncatula gaertn., populus trichocarpa torr. & gray and oryza sativa l., so the ptifg7- <dig> appears to be nested inside a larger uncharacterized copia-like element. the ptifg7- <dig> element shows 100% nucleotide identity to a single est, so it is possible that ptifg7- <dig> is also actively transcribed in the genome. a second relative of the ptifg <dig> element can be found in bac <dig>  instead of one long similarity hit, however, this new ptifg7- <dig> element is fragmented into five pieces and contains a number of unrelated repetitive elements and similarity hits. the pieces of the ptifg7- <dig> element average 66% nucleotide similarity to ptifg <dig> and 75% similarity to ptifg7- <dig>  since the similarity seen here is below 80%, we consider ptifg7- <dig> a distinct but related element to ptifg <dig> and ptifg7- <dig>  although we note that classification of these elements into classes and families is confused by the level of divergence among them. one similarity hit each to ltr retroelements in pinus elliottii engelm. and p. thunbergii parl. average only  <dig> bp in length and were uninformative.

two additional novel ltr retroelements were identified based on similarity to picea elements . bac <dig> contains a 2300-bp region showing 84-87% identity with the pggypsyx <dig>  retroelement in picea glauca   <cit> . the region is flanked by 90% identical ltrs, so this new gypsy-like element is tentatively described as ptgypsyx <dig>  the ptgypsyx <dig> retroelement is also present twice in bac <dig>  and the three copies described here are 87-89% similar at the nucleotide level. a strong hit in bac <dig> to the pgcopiax <dig>  element from picea glauca  is situated between direct repeats located about  <dig> kb apart, a space shared with hits to copia-like elements in m. truncatula and v. vinifera. it remains unclear whether this ltr-flanked portion of bac <dig> represents a single intact element, but the portion showing 79% nucleotide identity with the spruce element is tentatively identified as a fragment of the newly described ptcopiax <dig> element. the ptgypsyx <dig> and ptcopiax <dig> have different wgs coverage profiles between the thresholds , suggesting that they are older than the ptifg <dig> family. however, the ptgypsyx <dig> near position  <dig> kb in bac <dig> shows 100% nucleotide identity with six full-length p. taeda ests, so this element appears to be actively transcribing and proliferating in the genome. the ptcopiax <dig> element in bac <dig> has a relatively high wgs coverage in the ltrs and the portion corresponding to the assembled tpe1-containing element, but an internal portion  has a distinctly lower coverage than the ptcopiax <dig> in which it is nested. this copy of the ptcopiax <dig> element does not show similarity to any p. taeda ests, but the unrelated internal region  shows 100% nucleotide identity with two p. taeda ests. this particular copy of ptcopiax <dig> is dead, and in this case appears to contain an active transcribed repetitive element of unknown origin.

angiosperm-derived ltr retroelements
sequences similar to repbase or repeatmasker database repeats contribute 23% to the total bac assemblies, and contributions among bacs range from 19% in bac <dig> to 33% in bac <dig> . if 1% of the bacs are considered coding , this leaves approximately 75% of the bac sequence uncategorized. to determine if the uncategorized sequence was single-copy or repetitive, wgs reads were aligned to the bacs and the alignment depth at each position was observed. the total coverage represented by the wgs was  <dig> x of the genome, so most single-copy regions should appear unaligned. repetitive regions, however, are expected to have multiple aligned reads. alignments were categorized as either ≥ 99% identical or ≥ 75% identical. at the 99% threshold, most  of the bac sequence can be considered single-copy. there are a few regions, such as the newly characterized ptifg <dig>  which are repetitive at this stringent threshold . at the 75% threshold, most  of the bac sequence is repetitive. based on wgs coverage of the ptgypsyx <dig> elements in bac <dig> and bac <dig>  it is estimated that the genome contains  <dig> to  <dig> copies with ≥ 75% similarity and  <dig> to  <dig> copies with ≥ 99% similarity to the copies in the bacs. using the ptcopiax <dig> in bac <dig>  the copy number of this element is estimated to be around  <dig> at the 75% threshold and just over  <dig> at the 99% threshold. there also appear to be several new families of repeats as indicated by similarity to non-gymnosperms, with coverage profiles that appear to confirm and delineate repetitive units .

the average length of similarity between pine bac sequence and non-gymnosperm repbase accessions is  <dig> bp, far shorter than full-length transposons, and most hits were not suggestive of full-length repetitive elements in pine. the maker output also included  <dig> significant blastx hits to repeatmasker coding sequences, averaging  <dig> bp of coding similarity to reverse transcriptases or polyproteins in angiosperm retroelements. complicating novel retroelement identification is the fact that a single gymnosperm element often shows similarity to numerous angiosperm repeat accessions. using the repbase and repeatmasker similarity hits coupled with the wgs coverage profiles,  <dig> novel partial or full-length pine ltr retroelement sequences were tentatively identified based on similarity to non-gymnosperm accessions . seven of these are gypsy-like elements and eight appear to be copia-like ltr retrotransposons. informative repbase accessions originate from glycine max  merr., populus trichocarpa, oryza sativa, vitis vinifera, zea mays l., cicer arietinum l. lotus corniculatus l., and the novel pine retroelement sequences are indicated in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the  <dig> novel angiosperm-derived ltr retroelements tentatively identified in this study are also older and less frequent in the genome than ptifg <dig>  as evidenced by lower wgs coverage profiles and the presence of unrelated repetitive elements between the ltrs.

direct, tandem and simple repeats
at least  <dig> direct repeats were found among the bacs, with individual bacs ranging from four pairs  to  <dig> pairs . as discussed above and illustrated in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  about  <dig> pairs of direct repeats belong to identifiable ltr retroelements, and this is almost certainly an underestimate. many of the direct repeats appear to simply be repeated sequences. as a case in point, the ptifg <dig> element in bac <dig> contains a 142-bp sequence that is also found about  <dig> kb upstream of the ptifg <dig> element . this small repeated sequence does not show similarity to any known sequence, and it is unclear how one copy was inserted into the ptifg <dig> retroelement. the average nucleotide identity between direct repeats was 86% and ranged from 53% to 99%.

tandem repeats, or minisatellites, have not to date been investigated in a gymnosperm genome. tandem repeat finder identified  <dig> repeats of units 5- <dig> bp in length in the ten p. taeda bacs   <cit> . bac <dig> shows a large defined peak in wgs coverage at the 50-bp tandem near the middle of the bac . the common occurrence of tandem repeats in the bacs and the peak in wgs coverage profiles of the bac <dig> tandem together offer evidence that tandem repeats may be dispersed throughout the genome and contribute to genome complexity. simple repeats are difficult to quantify based on wgs coverage, but over  <dig> were identified among the ten p. taeda bacs . previous studies have shown that simple repeats and microsatellites are found throughout the pine genome  <cit> . using the unmasked maker runs, there were also  <dig> putative orf elements identified . these are consistently predicted reading frames that are not near any putative protein-coding genes or pseudogenes in the bacs. as can be seen in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the putative orf elements typically fall within repetitive regions of the bacs as indicated by wgs coverage. they are not confirmed to belong to, or consist of, novel repetitive elements, but the suggestions are offered here as researchers begin exploring the evolutionary history of the conifer genome and identify more novel gymnosperm-specific families of repeats.

genome-wide consensus repeats. to derive the full-length sequence of the most common repetitive elements in the genome, a highly permissive assembler was used to build the repeats from wgs reads . since no two reads are expected to truly overlap, the assembled elements are consensus sequences containing the most common base at each position. the most abundant element is  <dig> bp long  and is 90% identical to the 1663-bp tpe <dig> , an internal copia-like sequence used to assay the occurrence of such retroelements in a variety of large gymnosperm genomes  <cit> . alignments to wgs reads show that this element comprises approximately  <dig> % of the p. taeda genome. the assembled tpe1-containing element is present in bac <dig> in four fragments  within the ptcopiax <dig> element located there . although the ptcopiax <dig> bac <dig> was determined to be interrupted and inactive, the tpe1-containing consensus shows > 97% full-length nucleotide identity with at least five p. taeda ests. the second most common element in the genome is ptifg <dig>  of a similar size and abundance  to the tpe1-containing element. the third repeat assembled was a 50-nucleotide tandem repeat , comprising  <dig> % of the genome. this may correspond to the centromere repeat, and if so, represents the first example from a gymnosperm. the sequences of the three assembled elements are presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  a separate assay of the wgs reads found that  <dig> % contains the a-type telomeric repeat . this suggests that this telomeric repeat accounts for roughly 50- <dig> megabases of the genome.

*also reported are the results of a separate assay of the wgs reads for similarity to the consensus plant telomeric tandem repeat .

discussion
the purpose of this study was to explore the content and organization of a conifer genome and assess the feasibility of sequencing and assembling a reference pine genome. in the course of the study, several interesting aspects of the pine genome have emerged. analyses of the structure and content of ten p. taeda bacs suggest that pseudogenes may be common in the pine genome and that isolated repetitive elements such as ltr retrotransposons can be discerned from a background of fragmented fossil repeats of unknown origin. the frequency of partially conserved coding regions in the genome is consistent with the numerous hybridizations observed to probes for single-copy genes  <cit> . in these ten bacs, apparent pseudogenes appear to occur five times more frequently than true potentially functional protein-coding genes, but the bacs were enriched for coding sequences and represent only  <dig> % of the genome. whether this ratio extends to the entire genome remains to be seen. the common occurrence of pseudogenes in these bacs is consistent with the two conclusions from other studies:  most pine genes have many paralogues or pseudogenes and  pine genes are relatively compact. the accuracy of these and any other computational gene predictions in pine are limited by our incomplete knowledge of codon or promoter usage in pines. gene identification in this complex genome must be achieved through deep transcriptome or genome sequencing, as well as experimental validation of expression. it is, however, critical to note the pine genes do appear to be quite compact relative to the dauntingly vast genome size . thus, intermediate sequencing strategies that can leverage a deep transcriptome may efficiently assemble the primary functional genomic domains. genetic localization of such gene islands can serve both as an experimentally valuable  scaffold and a solid foundation for completion of a reference genome sequence.

previous studies showed that the pine genome is highly repetitive, but not predominantly high c0t  <cit> . the current study indicates that the reason for this is that there are many diverged repeats, and no single conserved repetitive element constitutes more than 2% of the genome. depending on how one conducts a hybridization experiment, one could see extremely different results. under stringent conditions , only 24% of the genome is repetitive. under more permissive conditions , 80% of the genome is repetitive. the present sequence survey of the pine genome supports the findings of hybridization studies by suggesting a massive 'low-copy' fraction and a very small 'high-copy' fraction containing a few repeat families that occur fewer than  <dig> times in the 22-gb genome. at this point, little else is known about ltr retroelement families and other types of repeats in pine except that they appear to be numerous and highly diverged. the ifg <dig> family of elements is currently thought to exist only in pinus, while ptcopiax <dig> looks to be shared with picea. while it is clear that a significant amount of work remains in order to truly determine the age of any ltr retroelements in pine, the fact that ptcopiax <dig> is about 85% identical with pgcopiax <dig> suggests that this element may have been present in the common ancestor of the two genera. considering that pinus and picea diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , this copia-like element could be ancient. alternatively, the retroviral progenitor of ptgypsyx <dig> and pggypsyx <dig> may have inserted multiple times during the evolution of conifers. in either case, two aspects of the ltr retroelements described in the bacs are fundamentally different from those found in other plant genomes: age and degree of divergence.

analyses of ltr retrotransposons have been performed in a wide variety of plant genomes including eudicot, monocot and gymnosperm species. the abundance and organization of these repetitive elements are loosely correlated with clade: eudicots generally have fewer and smaller repetitive elements than other clades, while the monocots are known for their high ltr retroelement activity and rapidly changing genomes. now, conifer genomes can be distinguished from angiosperm genomes by the old age and high degree of divergence in both their intact and fragmented ltr retrotransposons compared to the younger ltr retroelements in angiosperm genomes. a rapid increase of retroelement density in oryza sativa occurred around eight million years ago, but unequal homologous recombination subsequently removed two-thirds of that ltr retroelement sequence and left a genome consisting of only 26% retrotransposons  <cit> . the sorghum bicolor l.  genome, twice the size of oryza sativa, is composed of 55% retrotransposons that have mostly inserted in the last two million years  <cit> . the zea mays genome, three times as large as sorghum bicolor, contains roughly 80% retroelements, most of which are not present in the orthologous sorghum bicolor  <cit> . this implies that most of the ltr retroelements in the zea mays genome inserted since its divergence from the sorghum genome about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . a survey of two linked triticum aestivum l. bacs identified eleven ltr retroelements, all determined to have inserted less than 10- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the majority of ltr retroelements observed in these studies of grass genomes are relatively young and clearly distinguishable. in contrast, only two conifer-specific ltr retroelements in the bacs  may be still active after  <dig> million years, and the ifg <dig> family of gypsy-like elements appears to be active in both subgenera of pinus  <cit> , which diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

the bulk of the pine genome remains an enigma. it appears to contain diverged fragments of an extremely diverse set of repetitive elements. the analyses performed here virtually exhaust similarity-based identification so future repeat discovery will require additional genomic sequence. in any case the implications of the ancient and diverged nature of the repeats that comprise a majority of the pine genome are both theoretical and practical. the conservative karyotype and the lack of rapid turnover of the vast and repetitive portion of the pine genome raises questions about the possible functional roles leading to evolutionary constraint, and about potentially unique mechanisms for the maintenance of genomic integrity. in terms of the challenging goal of a reference pine genome sequence, this predominance of a highly diverged repetitive component is critical since large amounts of identical dispersed repeats are inevitable sources of gaps in an assembly.

CONCLUSIONS
in this detailed analysis of ten pinus taeda bacs, we identified three putative protein-coding genes and at least fifteen pseudogenes or gene fragments. examining the bacs in the context of  <dig>  million wgs reads and  <dig> similarity hits to repeat databases, we found that  <dig> % of the bacs had high wgs coverage or significant similarity to one of three positively identifiable conifer-specific ltr retroelements . an additional 12% of the bacs contain relicts of ltr retrotransposons that were tentatively identified as copia-like or gypsy-like based on similarity to angiosperm repeats. simple repeats and imperfect tandem repeats together represent less than 4% of the total bac sequence. direct repeats larger than  <dig> bp occupy nearly 30% of the bac sequence, but two thirds of pairs are less than 90% similar  and only a minority are clearly associated with a retroelement. the majority of the bac assemblies were comprised of ancient repetitive sequences. this is in sharp contrast to the oryza sativa, sorghum bicolor and zea mays genomes, where recently amplified and minimally diverged ltr retrotransposons occupy much of the intergenic space. there is no evidence of recent segmental or block duplications within the bacs.

these preliminary insights into the nature of repeats in the pine genome provide compelling evidence that sequencing a large pine genome such as p. taeda is certainly within reach. sequencing a genome this large using a rigorous bac-by-bac approach, however, would entail an exorbitant time and monetary cost. can p. taeda be sequenced and assembled from wgs reads? it is difficult to answer this definitively because no one has attempted to assemble a 22-gb genome to date, but one can gain insight by comparing the repeat content to sequenced genomes. the p. taeda genome contains fewer repeats that are nearly identical  than either sorghum bicolor or zea mays . the sorghum bicolor genome was successfully assembled from wgs sanger reads, and the pinus genome contains fewer recently amplified, and highly similar, repeats than sorghum  <cit> . the degree of divergence within the genome should facilitate assembly of a draft sequence for p. taeda. based on the age and diversity of pine repeats, it may even be possible to assemble the genome using a whole genome shotgun strategy based on several platforms and a range of insert sizes. regardless of strategy, the massive p. taeda genome will surely challenge the limits of contemporary sequencing technology.
