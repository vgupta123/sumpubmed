BACKGROUND
global level profiling of in vivo protein-dna interactions using chip-based technologies has evolved rapidly in recent years, from hybridization with spotted or tiling microarray   <cit> , to sage-like tags   <cit>  or pair-end tag sequencing   <cit> , to current massively parallel sequencing   <cit> .

estrogen-mediated gene regulation is such a challenging question that it may require powerful genome-wide profiling tools like chip-based technologies. in breast cancer cells, erα can mediate genomic transcription regulation with nuclear initiated steroid signalling and non-genomic activation of various protein kinase cascades  <cit> . in the classical genomic pathway, estrogen receptor binds to estrogen response elements  at the regulatory region of the target genes and recruits co-activators or co-repressors to modulate gene transcription  <cit> . the non-classical genomic pathway does not require ere but mediates transcription by the interactions of erα with other proteins such as ap <dig>  <cit> , nf-kb  <cit> , sp <dig>  <cit>  and others. at molecular level, we need to identify those genes targeted and regulated by estrogen receptors, and the more challenging task is to delineate the architectures and the underlying mechanisms of such regulation. estrogen receptors, once activated, may induce increased or decreased transcription of its numerous targets, which have been investigated by expression arrays  <cit> . in some recent publications, profiling the distribution of erα by chip-seq chip-pet and chip-chip indicated a highly complicated regulation network involved with both erα and other relative transcription factors  <cit> . for instance, only a small portion of erα binding sites were located in the promoter regions of known genes and many unforeseen binding sites could be far away from the tss, up to 50- <dig> kb. it was also found that a large number of transcription factors had binding sites co-enriched with erα binding sites, which indicated a close collaboration between erα and other factors. all these findings support the evolving concept of estrogen receptor regulation from the conventional interaction between ere and erα to the long-range chromatin loop  <cit> .

tamoxifen is one of selective er modulators  and is widely used to block erα function for breast cancer treatment  <cit> ; however, this endocrine therapy is limited by the onset of drug resistance. tamoxifen resistance could be induced through both genomic and non-genomic estrogen pathways mentioned above and understanding estrogen regulation network will offer therapeutic advantages. our recent expression array study showed that, in breast cancer cells with acquired tamoxifen resistance, different groups of genes were targeted by estrogen treatment compared with the parental cells  <cit> . delineating the changed architectures of the erα regulation network in tamoxifen resistance cells by chip-based assays may provide direct and useful information on tamoxifen resistance.

in this study, we collected three public available chip-based datasets--chip-chip, chip-pet and chip-seq for erα binding sites in breast cancer mcf <dig> cells upon estrogen exposure, which also include rna polymerase ii  binding sites in these cells since the binding of pol-ii could provide direct information of potential transcription activation. we then applied computational approaches to investigate the hierarchical regulatory information for erα regulation in mcf <dig> cells. we have been able to construct hierarchical regulatory networks with target hubs and have established the regulatory pathways between tfs and genes. we also have applied chip-seq technology to systematically compare the estrogen-mediated regulatory information between mcf <dig> and mcf7-t cells.

RESULTS
whole-genome-wide localization of in vivo erα/pol-ii binding peaks to genes in breast cancer cells
it is well recognized that the transcription is driven by pol-ii and the general transcriptional machinery; therefore, it is likely that the genes  bound by erα may not be transcribed without pol-ii binding. as such, we need to use the whole-genome-wide binding peaks information combining erα with pol-ii antibodies.

the peak-calling procedure was described in the methods section. the number of chip peaks from chip-seq is  <dig>  for erα and  <dig>  for pol-ii upon e2-treated compared to the vehicle control, the number from chip-pet is  <dig>  for erα and  <dig>  for pol-ii, the number from chip-chip is  <dig>  for erα and  <dig>  for pol-ii .

our previous studies  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have tried to establish and characterize the molecular mechanisms of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. in order to further elucidate the more detailed underlying mechanisms, we then created a whole-genome-wide localization of in vivo erα binding peaks in the mcf <dig>  we located these identified erα and pol-ii binding peaks relative to a known annotated gene from the refseq database . our results showed that 18% for chip-seq, 44% for chip-pet, 45% for chip-chip of pol-ii binding peaks are located within promoter regions  of a known transcription start site  . we also found that a relatively small number of erα binding peaks are located in a known 5'tss region . a big portion of erα binding peaks are located within intra-genic regions  as well as gene desert regions ,  <dig> kb far away from known 5'tsss and 3'tsss . while our location analysis confirms the results from previous studies  <cit>  where the data were collected, our comparative analysis further showed erα binding patterns are essentially similar in which the majority of erα binding peaks are outside of proximal promoter regions regardless of different chip technologies. our analysis also suggests that most erα associated genes may be regulated by the long-distance interaction between er-bound distal enhancer and proximal promoter regions. we also found that some portions  of pol-ii binding peaks are located in the 3' ends . this finding might imply some alternative transcripts are transcribed in the 3' end and is consistent to the previous report of alternative promoters identified in the 3' end  <cit> . this could also be simply due to either stalled rna pol ii that has finished transcription or loops formed with the promoters as has been proposed  <cit> .

regulation of erα target gene expression in mcf <dig> cells
we then systematically compared three different chip based technologies. we aim to correlate  <dig>  e2-induced genes identified by carroll et al.  <cit>  to erα and pol-ii binding peaks identified from different chip-based datasets. for pol-ii binding peaks, we only considered those peaks within proximal upstream regions  relative of tss, within intra-genic regions, and within proximal downstream regions  relative of tts. for erα binding peaks, we considered all binding peaks except those in the gene desert regions . for chip-seq data, it turned out to have a total of  <dig>  erα binding peaks corresponded to  <dig>  annotated genes and  <dig>  pol-ii binding peaks corresponded to  <dig>  genes. and  <dig>  genes were identified to have both pol-ii and erα binding peaks in chip-seq dataset . among these  <dig>  genes with enriched double  binding peaks, only  <dig> of them overlapped with  <dig>  e2-induced genes in mcf <dig> show differential expression . surprisingly, a majority  of genes in chip-seq dataset with differential expression lack erα and pol-ii binding sites. after examining the correlation of erα and pol-ii identified by chip-chip dataset in mcf <dig>  we obtained very similar results, where  <dig> genes have both pol-ii and er enriched binding peaks. . in order to exclude different experiments' discrepancy, we also compared the erα and pol-ii binding data identified by chip-pet, and e2-induced expression data in mcf <dig>  similarly, only  <dig> common genes were obtained . the overlap of gene number of three different technologies was shown in figure 1b. overall, the similar findings in all three chip-based dataset seem to indicate that erα binding and e2-mediated pol-ii binding in most of erα direct targets may not necessarily lead to detectable activated or repressed expression changes. instead, they may be in paused states as the previous reports suggested  <cit> . meanwhile, it also seems that a majority of e2-induced expression changes could be caused by downstream estrogen effect and may have not direct and close correlation with erα-recruited pol-ii complex for transcription initiation  <cit> .

we also found that  <dig> genes  are common between chip-seq and chip-chip  while  <dig>  common genes between chip-chip and chip-pet . a comparison of chip-seq and chip-pet has shown that they have  <dig>  common genes .

de novo identification for erα binding sites and its binding partners in mcf <dig> cells
one possible scenario to explain why the majority of erα direct targets are not activated or repressed is that they may lack certain binding tf partners serving as helpers for erα to co-regulate these genes. thus we applied the de novo motif discovery approach   <cit>  developed in our previous study to identify the known or novel erα tf partners. chipmotifs is online software designed for searching the most significant motifs in given peaks based on the known factor motifs in transfac  <cit>  and jaspar  <cit>  databases.

in this study, for each chip-based dataset, we selected the top  <dig> peaks with high scores  as the input data for chipmotifs. after running chipmotifs, ere, pax <dig>  pitx <dig> and rora were identified in chip-seq data; ere, pitx <dig>  rora and gata <dig> were identified in chip-chip data; rora, pax <dig>  pitx <dig> and ere were identified in chip-pet data . we failed to identify several tfs   <cit> , foxa <dig>  <cit> ) reported to be associated with erα in previous studies. one possible reason is that our de novo chipmotifs first ab initio identify motifs at a set of relatively short sequences , then find possible matched tfs from the transfac database after obtaining significant motifs, therefore, this might miss some co-tfs if they locate outside  <dig> bp distance from erα. but if we used longer sequences, that might lose the specificity for the identified motifs such as missing identifying ere. regardless, we chose to include these three co-tfs  in our further analysis. these tfs' seq-logos in chip-seq data, chip-chip data and chip-pet data were shown in figure  <dig>  further analysis of these data indicates that in addition to ere, there are two tf motifs common among chip-seq data, chip-chip data and chip-pet data--pitx <dig> and rora .

erα regulatory network in estrogen-dependent mcf <dig> cells
previous studies have shown erα regulates its target genes through three major binding models a) direct binding to ere ; b) indirect binding, through which it binds to other tf partners which bind to dna; and c) co-occurrent binding, where both erα and other tf partners bind to their own specific dna motifs   <cit> .

in order to understand how the regulatory network responds to e <dig> treatment in three chip-based technologies, we here integrated the chip data with the time series of e <dig> induced gene expression data. in order to determine if a gene is differentially expressed, we used the difference of expression levels between time point  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr, positive value as up-regulated and negative value as down-regulated. thus all genes in the networks were differentially expressed and with erα and polii binding chip-peaks . furthermore, for the transcriptional regulatory network , only transcription factors were used for the network construction . erα binding peaks associated with those normal tfs were further scanned by hub tf  pwms to determine if there is any connection between a hub tf and a normal tf. a shuffling test was performed to test the reliability of each connection of the network. the resulted regulatory networks were thus constructed and topologically visualized using cytoscape  <cit>  software platform . in the network, all the normal/hub tfs were represented as a node , and all the connections were represented as edge between  <dig> nodes . an edge has a direction, where it starts from hub tfs to normal tfs. the edge between a hub tf pwm  and a normal tf differentially expressed following estrogen stimulation  means that a motif of hub tf  is found within erα peak region associated with another tf gene . since every normal tf was with both erα and pol-ii peaks, the edge represented for the possible direct/indirect binding of hub tf  together with erα to regulate normal tf .

in summary,  <dig> nodes  were identified for chip-seq data,  <dig> for chip-pet and  <dig> for chip-chip . a comparison of the three regulatory networks shows that there are  <dig> common hubs  and  <dig>  common targeted tfs  in mcf <dig>  the final combined erα regulatory network for mcf <dig> cell from all three chip-based datasets was shown in figure  <dig> 

erα regulatory pathway analysis in estrogen-dependent mcf <dig> cells
we next applied drem program to model, analyze, and visualize dynamic gene regulatory functions  <cit> . the maps would potentially infer major bifurcation events in the time series expression data and transcription factors responsible for them. take the chip-seq data as example, we used  <dig> erα associated tf partners--rora, pitx <dig> and pax <dig> were identified by de novo chipmotifs from our data, and cebp, fos  and foxa <dig> were known tf partners of erα. after integrating the tf-dna interactions data with  <dig>  genes , a total of  <dig> paths were clearly diverging for these genes ). the same tf partners were used in chip-pet dataset ). the tf pax <dig> was replaced with gata <dig> in chip-chip dataset ). all the tf partners were selected based on the chipmotifs results . a final combined regulatory pathway map obtained from three chip data showed that genes were traversing the  <dig> splits are shown with  corresponding to the split at  <dig> hr,  corresponding to the split at  <dig> hr and  corresponding to the split at  <dig> hr . the paths out of the splits were annotated with tfs determined by drem to be associated with the genes assigned to the path at a score <  <dig> . the go annotations for genes in  <dig> of the paths were shown at the right with their p-values . our finding showed e <dig> mediated a set of repressed genes with direct erα binding sites where they are overrepresented with lytic vacuole/lysossome . we further revealed a new estrogen-mediated up-regulated path requiring a tf partner pitx <dig>  and the function of this set of genes is associated with ribonucleoprotein complex , mrna metabolic process , mrna processing  and chromosome . our analysis also showed other paths with less significant genes: lyase activity with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> , response to virus with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  we also found that the tf fos, cebp, foxa <dig> and pitx <dig> are related to the up-regulated genes, while foxa <dig> was shown up in both up and down-regulated genes. the gene lists of five paths were shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the relationship of the  <dig> tfs  and their related genes were shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

a comparison of mcf7-t and mcf <dig> cells
to further understand the difference of the erα associated gene regulatory information between mcf <dig> and mcf7-t, a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line, we conducted erα and pol-ii chip-seq experiments in mcf7-t cells . around  <dig> million reads were obtained for pol-ii control data, and  <dig> million reads in pol-ii e2-treated data. for erα antibody, the number is  <dig> million for control data and  <dig> million for e2-treated data . after uniquely mapping to the human genome, the reads number reduced to  <dig> million for pol-ii control data,  <dig> million for pol-ii e <dig> treated data,  <dig> million for erα control data and  <dig> million for e <dig> treated data, respectively . in general, 25-30% reads were uniquely mapped to the human genome.

in mcf7-t cells,  <dig>  erα binding peaks corresponded to  <dig>  annotated genes and  <dig>  pol-ii binding peaks corresponded to  <dig>  genes were found.  <dig> genes were identified to have both pol-ii and erα binding peaks .  <dig> of them show differential expression overlapped with  <dig>  e2-induced genes identified in mcf7-t expression profile analysis . similar to the mcf <dig> cells, a majority  of genes with differential expression lack erα and pol-ii binding peaks.

since we used chip-seq technology for mcf7-t cells, we compared the number of erα regulated genes between mcf7-t and mcf <dig> cells using chip-seq technology. to illustrate the difference of these two cell lines, we first compared the overlapped number of genes with erα binding peak and pol-ii binding peak, respectively. we found that  <dig> genes were overlapped with erα binding peak for both mcf <dig> and mcf7-t cell lines, and this number is  <dig> for pol-ii binding peak. we also found that only  <dig>  common genes  between these two breast cancer cells. this low overlapped number demonstrated that erα targeted different sets of genes in these two cancer cells.

we next applied the same computational analytical approach to examine the erα regulated network in mcf7-t cells. we started with training the top  <dig> erα binding peaks with high scores  by the chipmotifs, a total of  <dig> tfs were identified, including ere, pax <dig>  pitx <dig>  rora, xbp <dig>  pparg and ppara . of them, ere, pax <dig>  pitx <dig> and rora are the same as the ones we identified in chip-seq data of mcf <dig> cells.

the erα associated transcriptional regulatory network in mcf7-t cells was then constructed and visualized as shown in figure 5c, including  <dig> nodes. a comparison of the networks between mcf7-t and mcf <dig> cells  showed that there are  <dig> common hub tfs  and  <dig>  common targeted tfs. however, in mcf <dig> cells we found that there are  <dig> common hub tfs and  <dig>  common targeted tfs among different chip technologies. taken together, our results strongly suggested that e <dig> induces a different erα associated regulatory mechanism in mcf7-t cells compared to mcf <dig> cells, in other words, a rewired erα regulation network in tamoxifen resistance cells.

discussion
in this study, we applied computational approaches to analyze and integrate three chip-based datasets and one time-series gene expression data to investigate the dynamic regulatory information for erα in estrogen-dependent breast cancer mcf <dig> cells. our studies not only compared the results of three chip-based protocols, but also have inferred the regulatory network and pathway for e <dig> induced mcf <dig> cells. moreover, we used the same approach to compare the difference between mcf <dig> and mcf7-t cells.

our comprehensive analysis of the estrogen-mediated regulatory network in mcf <dig> indicated that the three chip-based technologies have similar peak distribution patterns for the same antibody. however, for different antibody , the binding preference is totally different. pol-ii tends to binding to the promoter region, while erα has no specific preference.

our analysis  also showed that there were more common regulated genes  between chip-seq data and chip-pet data than chip-chip data. this may be due to a similar sequencing-based technology used for chip-seq and chip-pet, but an array-based technology used for chip-chip data. the regulatory network analysis indicates some common regulatory hub tfs were formed in response to estrogen signaling and may lead to the same regulatory paths in mcf <dig>  we also found that there are ~40% common tfs regulated by erα among three different chip-based technologies.

we also compared the regulatory network in mcf <dig> constructed by our approach with another method--remodiscovery  <cit> . we used  <dig>  , and  <dig>   as the input threshold. total  <dig>  nodes were overlapped between our method  and remodiscovery .

in figure  <dig>  all the genes were with both erα and pol-ii peak binding, and differentially expression between  <dig> hours of e <dig> treat and control. in figure 4a, the genes were clustered based on the expression values. each thin line meant the gene expression data  at different time point. the genes were classified into  <dig> groups ,  <dig> groups  and  <dig> groups , respectively. the thick lines corresponded to the gene expression trend of each group. in figure 4b, the important hub tfs  were identified for each group at every time point . the  <dig> groups of genes were also showed significantly different gene functions. we listed the functions and p-values. figure 4c  showed both up and down regulated genes,  corresponded to down regulated genes, and  corresponded to up regulated genes. a tf-gene relationship table is prepared as the input of drem . in this table,  <dig> represented motif of hub tf existed in the peak region of a gene.

since a totally different technology is used for chip-chip data, in order to reduce the inconsistency caused by the technology itself, we further examined only chip-seq and chip-pet data to reproduce the network . we found a total of  <dig> tfs in the network in which there is about 50% increase in terms of the number of nodes. after comparing the combined network  with chip-seq network  or chip-pet network , about 60% of the tfs were overlapped. however, this number is only 40% for the combined network of three technologies together.

the hierarchical regulatory network analysis with drem and cytoscape revealed that rora could be a potential erα partner, which is consistent to other reports  <cit>  showing that rora interacts with erα and enhances er transcriptional activity in breast cancer. this finding also indicates that rora was required for a subset of e2-mediated up-regulated genes associated with functions of lyase activity. our results may provide the guidance for further investigation on the role of this co-regulation pathway played in breast cancer.

in mcf7-t cells, we found very small proportion  of differential expressed genes overlapped with mcf <dig> cells  with both erα and pol-ii binding peaks. in addition, the number of common tfs of the network between mcf7-t and mcf <dig> cells is only 25%. moreover, we also found two tfs with opposite expression trend between mcf <dig> and mcf7-t cells, in which msx <dig> is up-regulated in mcf7-t cells and down-regulated in mcf <dig> cells, whereas esr <dig>  is down-regulated in mcf7-t cells. we also identified  <dig> new hub tfs in mcf7-t cells which were not found in mcf <dig> cells. this indicates that erα may be no longer the most important transcription factor, other transcriptional regulators and signalling pathways may play important role in tamoxifen resistant mcf <dig> cells. our comparative analysis also suggests that the erα associated regulatory network in mcf7-t cells is rewired upon e <dig> induced.

we have performed additional experiments using both rt-qpcr and chip-qpcr to validate randomly select eight er regulated binding loci in mcf7-t cell, and the result demonstrated that the predicted er regulated binding loci with differential gene expression after e <dig> treatment were validated as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> 

we further compared the e <dig> induced gene functions to specify the difference between mcf <dig> and mcf7-t cell line. we selected the genes that were differentially expressed and with erα and polii binding site. these genes were performed by go function by the david program  <cit>  and the top  <dig>  categories were selected based on the p-value. the result was shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> functions were the same between those two groups of genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we analyzed hierarchical regulatory networks for estrogen-dependent regulation in mcf <dig> and mcf7-t cells. we systematically compared different chip-based technologies as well as different breast cancer cells. our results revealed extended hierarchal regulatory networks with new target hubs in breast cancer cells. our computational analytical approach may also provide a framework for dissecting transcriptional regulatory networks in response to breast cancer and other human diseases.
