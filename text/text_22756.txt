BACKGROUND
almost the entire trans-acting fraction of genetic information is represented by the transcriptome, the population of transcribed sequences in a cell. in terms of complexity, much of the functional transcriptome of eukaryotic cells has traditionally been considered poly-adenylated and translated. in terms of quantity, this poly-adenylated fraction constitutes only 3–6% of the total rna population. for these reasons, experimental representation of eukaryotic transcriptomes was usually done by constructing cdna libraries from the poly a+ fraction of the rna population. all such libraries do not, by design, represent the entire trans-acting genetic information. they lack representation of non-coding but functional rnas , e.g.  <cit> , including the abundant but low complexity trnas and rrnas and the increasingly studied populations of various snrnas, scrnas, snornas, telomeric rnas, vrnas, and micrornas  <cit> . they lack representation of the mrnas of organelles – mitochondria and chloroplasts – for which polyadenylation may be a signal for degradation  <cit> . they lack representation of mrnas that are not poly-adenylated or lose their polya tails, but are nevertheless translated  <cit> . the recent call for a more systematic examination of the entire transcriptome – rnomics  <cit>  led to much greater interest in ncrnas and a variety of wet and computational approaches to their identification .

our purpose here was to develop a library construction method that would result in a more complete representation, in useable form, of the transcriptome. we reasoned that self-subtraction  <cit> , which equalizes the representation of different sequences through reassociation kinetics, should work as well as poly a+ selection for reducing the frequency of the abundant but low-complexity rrnas and trnas, without eliminating them, or any other polya- rnas, from cdna libraries. we describe here the method and show that informative, random-primed, directional, and more completely representative cdna libraries can be made from partially degraded total rna.

RESULTS
rna preparation
since a method for the production of high-quality, more fully representative cdna libraries from even difficult samples was sought, three very different rna sources were chosen:  <dig> hour zebrafish  embryos, field-collected  <dig> hour embryonic amphioxus , and isolated 3rd instar fruitfly  larval brain and eye discs. total rna was extracted from these samples with trizol . contaminating genomic dna was completely removed from aliquots of the rnas by digestion with  <dig> u rnase-free dnase /ug rna in the manufacturer's buffer for  <dig> minutes at room temperature.  <dig> μg of rnase free glycogen  was then added and the sample re-extracted with trizol . total rna was partially hydrolyzed in  <dig> mm co <dig>  ph  <dig> , for  <dig> min. at 60°c. this resulted in a population of 100– <dig> nt rna fragments .

cdna synthesis
double-stranded  cdnas were synthesized from the partially-degraded total rna by a standard gubler-hoffman replacement procedure. primer and template were annealed by mixing  <dig> μg of the partially hydrolyzed, dna-free rna with  <dig>  μg of the 5'-phosphorylated, directional, 1st-strand primer  , heating to 70°c for  <dig> minutes, and quenching briefly on ice. the first strand was synthesized by incubating the annealed mix with  <dig> units of superscript ii reverse transcriptase  for one hour at 45°c in the manufacturer's buffer containing  <dig> mm dtt and  <dig>  mm dntps. the second strand was synthesized by adding  <dig> μl h2o,  <dig> μl 5× 2nd strand buffer ,  <dig> μl dntps ,  <dig> μl ®nad ,  <dig> μl e. coli dna ligase ,  <dig> μl  <dig>  m dtt,  <dig> μl e. coli dna polymerase i , and  <dig> μl e. coli rnase h . the reaction mixture was incubated for  <dig> hours at 16°c. double-stranded cdnas were then blunt-ended by adding  <dig> units of t <dig> dna polymerase  and continuing the incubation for  <dig> minutes. the blunt-ended, double-stranded cdnas  were then extracted with phenol:chloroform , precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol and then resuspended in  <dig> μl of te. lone linker ll <dig>  was prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of ll1l and ll1r  for  <dig> minutes at room temperature in te.  <dig>  μg of ll <dig> was then added to the cdna and ligated overnight at 16°c . ligated cdnas were extracted with phenol:chloroform  and precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol and resuspended in  <dig> μl te. fragments smaller than approximately  <dig> bp were removed by sepharose cl-6b  gel filtration. the  <dig> μl flow-through peak was collected and the cdnas precipitated with sodium acetate,  <dig> μl of glycogen carrier and ethanol and resuspended in  <dig> μl te. this > <dig> bp cdna population was amplified in a  <dig> cycle pcr reaction. each  <dig> μl reaction contained  <dig> μg of the primer ll1p,  <dig> u and  <dig>  u of vent exo-, and exo+ thermostable dna polymerases  respectively,  <dig>  mm dntps, and  <dig> μl of α32p dctp. an initial incubation at 72°c for one minute generated full-length 3' ends  . the first  <dig> cycles were 95°c, 55°c, and 72°c for  <dig> min each. in the final three cycles, the 72°c extension steps were increased to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min. respectively. amplified cdnas were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.

self-subtraction
 <dig> μg of amplified cdna in  <dig> μl of annealing buffer  ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta) containing  <dig> ng of ll1f was overlayed with mineral oil, denatured by boiling for  <dig> min and then annealed at 60°c for one hour .  <dig> μl of binding buffer , ph  <dig> ) was added to the bottom aqueous phase which was then transferred to another tube.  <dig> μl of hydrated hydroxylapatite  suspended in  <dig>  ml of binding buffer at 60°c was then added and the suspension incubated at 60°c for  <dig> min with frequent mixing. bound dsdna and hydroxylapatite were removed completely by discarding the pellets after two consecutive centrifugations . the 32p counts of sample aliquots taken before and after subtraction, indicated that between  <dig> and 97% of the cdna was bound to the hydroxylapatite and removed. the hydroxylapatite phosphate buffer was replaced with  <dig> mm tris,  <dig> mm edta, ph <dig> , by four consecutive exchanges in centricon- <dig> filters . the remaining single-stranded  cdnas were then subjected to a second round of amplification, and self-subtraction as described above, with the exception that the second reannealing time was  <dig> hours instead of one hour . approximately 80% of the cdna amplified after the first subtraction was removed in the second self-subtraction. the phosphate buffer of the second self-subtraction reaction was exchanged for te as described. the final double-stranded cdna population for cloning was generated using the same pcr protocol used for the previous amplifications.

cloning
regenerated ds cdnas were then digested with bam hi and asc i, and size-selected by agarose gel electrophoresis to obtain 200– <dig> bp cdna fractions. these were then ligated into pke- <dig> or pke- <dig> vectors  <cit>  and used to transform e. coli dh10b  by electroporation. the three cdna libraries – amphioxus, drosophila and zebrafish – contained  <dig> ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig>  and  <dig> ×  <dig> independent clones respectively.

analysis
the cloning strategy was designed to preserve the orientation of the cdnas. the first strand directional random primer, drp <dig>  contained, from 5' to 3',  <dig> nt of defined buffer sequence, the  <dig> nt asci restriction endonuclease sequence,  <dig> nt of random sequence and a 3' t nucleotide . the 5' buffer sequence was included to prevent destruction of the asci site by the 5'->3' exonuclease activity of e. coli poli during second-strand synthesis. using a primer which did not contain the buffer sequence resulted in the frequent appearance of cdna clones that had lost the asci site and therefore orientation . t was added to the 3' end and as were excluded from the defined primer sequence at the cost of initiating cdna synthesis at a  to eliminate an observed drp <dig> self-priming artifact during first-strand synthesis.

we tested the procedure by sequencing random clones picked from the different cdna libraries. in an initial test,  <dig> clones from the amphioxus library,  <dig> from the zebrafish library, and  <dig> from the drosophila library were sequenced. of the  <dig> clones,  <dig> clones contained no cdnas and  <dig> clones yielded unreadable sequence data. the remaining sequences were compared to the ncbi non-redundant combined protein, combined dna, and combined est sequence databases, using the tblastx search procedure  <cit> . in the self-subtracted libraries,  <dig> sequences matched translated rnas, ests, or gene exons  and 87% of these were in the forward reading frame. this fraction is within the 80–95% observed in directional cdna libraries made by standard approaches using oligo dt primed cdnas  <cit> , indicating that the directional cloning strategy functions properly. that cloning was, as designed, directional.  <dig> matches to genomic dna that were not part of any known functional or encoding rna were identified. since the first strand priming technique was not completely random and the directional primer included additional 5' gc-rich sequence , we were concerned that priming might be biased towards gc-rich regions. we examined this using clones which identified perfect matches in the sequence databases. from the  <dig> such clones we collected the  <dig> nucleotides of sequence data lying within  <dig> nt of the 3' end of the random primer, i.e. under the non-random 5' portion of drp <dig>  these sequences were 49% g+c, indicating that the additional gc rich sequence in the 5' portion of the first strand cdna primer did not seriously bias the priming process. 74% of the sequenced clones in the self-subtracted libraries contained an a at the sixth nucleotide following the asci restriction site in the primer, indicating that cdna synthesis mostly initiated, as designed, at an a .

since these data provided an initial indication that the library construction technique was working as expected, we randomly picked and sequenced another  <dig> colonies from the danio rerio library. all the danio rerio and drosophila sequences were then compared to the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide sequence database  using tblastx and to the ensembl unmasked zebrafish genome  using blastn set to oligo sensitivity. of the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> sequences showed inconclusive or no matches. the remainder matched genomic dna to better than 97%, indicating that the genomic source contexts of almost all cdnas were identified . these were then categorized with respect to known or hypothetical transcription units .  <dig> of the  <dig> matches are unique in sequenced population, coming from different loci. although the source material for these libraries was partially degraded total rna, 70% of the sequences matched known or hypothetical mrnas. 17% of these were novel, being either first matches to hypothetical mrna sequence or unknown splice variants of previously identified mrna transcription loci. 16% of sequences matched hnrna sequence likely removed during mrna splicing – which does not necessarily mean that they are non-functional. eight matches to known or hypothetical ncrna loci were identified. these included one match to a large rrna transcription unit and  <dig> matches to known or hypothetical ncrna transcription units encoding mirnas. a total of  <dig> matches were outside either known or predicted transcription units. one of these exhibited discontinuous matches to very closely linked same-strand sequence in the genome, indicative of splicing, and suggested a novel unpredicted transcription unit. a total of  <dig> clones, some in known or predicted introns and others outside of predicted transcription units exhibited significant  matches to a large number of loci  dispersed throughout the genome. these may represent undescribed interspersed repeat elements  in the zebrafish.

in  <dig> of the matches, orientation of the cdnas could be assigned relative to known or hypothetical loci. of these, 80% were in the sense orientation. of the antisense matches, only four could clearly be considered artifacts of cloning.  <dig> antisense clones were structurally normal, exhibiting the appropriate transitions from cdna to vector sequences, but were spliced according to their sense strand match. although this suggests that the antisense orientation is an artifact of cloning, such precisely matching non-canonical splicing has been reported for at least one genuine antisense transcript  <cit> .

we turn finally to the question of the extent of subtraction. the library data clearly show that the cdna population was subtracted enough to remove most representation of the abundant rrnas and greatly increase the representation of the different mrna species. however, equalization was not complete. since the transcriptome contains all intron sequences, which greatly exceed the mrna population in complexity , a complete subtraction would be expected to contain far more intron than mrna sequence. this is not the case in the libraries examined, where mrna sequences outnumber intron sequences by a ratio of almost 7: <dig>  we addressed the issue of equalization within the mrna population in two different ways. we determined the frequency of β-actin sequence, a particularly abundant mrna, by probing the 200– <dig> bp zebrafish library with antisense oligonucleotide. only one β-actin clone was identified among  <dig> ×  <dig> colonies. since β-actin represents approximately 1% of the mrnas of embryonic zebrafish heart  <cit>  and is relatively constant across tissues under physiological conditions  <cit> , the representation of this abundant mrna has been reduced in the equalized libraries. in the second approach, we compared mrna representation among our sequences with mrna representation in an unsubtracted cdna library constructed from  <dig> hour embryonic zebrafish heart  <cit> . in the heart library, there are  <dig> mrnas that are represented at frequencies between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . of these abundant mrnas, two are represented once in our collection of  <dig> zebrafish cdna sequences and the rest were not represented at all. there were two other mrna loci that were represented twice among the zebrafish self-subtracted sequences, one encoding ankyrin  <dig> and the other encoding ran-binding protein  <dig>  neither of these two loci were represented in the  <dig> sequences from the heart library.

there are several points of caution in using the procedure. in self-subtraction, it is the complexity of contaminating sequence, rather than its abundance, that may determine the extent of contamination in the final library. even a few picograms of genomic dna has a greater complexity than the entire functional rna population. although the importance and extent of non-coding transcripts is under revision  <cit>  we did not observe any advantage to increasing the extent of self subtraction, either by including additional rounds of self subtraction or by increasing the cot value of the subtractions. clones chosen from a fourth library that had gone through an additional round of self-subtraction and amplification did not match any mrnas 

the goal of the described procedure was to have as much as possible of the entire rna population represented in a library, not to have it represented in full length copies. some functional non-coding rnas are almost certainly excluded from the libraries. we have used the procedure successfully on cdna fragments as small as 100– <dig> bp. self subtracted libraries of smaller sequences may be possible if the phosphate concentration in the hydroxylapatite binding buffer is decreased and only small sequences are included in the reaction. the smallest functional processed rnas, e.g. the  <dig> nt micrornas, will not be represented, although their primary transcripts certainly are. since the procedure functions via inter-molecular reassociation kinetics, sequences with extensive self-homology  will be removed independent of their abundance in the rna population. the procedure will not work well for most full length transcripts since amplifying sequences larger than even  <dig> base-pairs in size is more difficult and more sensitive to reaction conditions. even in our target size range of 200– <dig> bp there are undoubtedly some sequences that do not amplify well by pcr and are therefore underrepresented. we believe that the more complete representation possible with short sequences offsets the disadvantage of not cloning full length copies, especially as the sequences are more than long enough to identify significant matches in the databases, encode many complete protein domains, and to serve as probes for cloning or assembling full-length cdnas by the many other methods available.

CONCLUSIONS
the simple procedures described here permit the construction of high-quality, directional cdna libraries using small amounts of degraded total rna. since the method does not distinguish between polya+ and polya- species, all rnas above  <dig> nt may be represented, including polya- mrnas and many functional but non-translated rnas. the procedure should prove valuable in situations where more complete representation of the transcriptome is desired.
