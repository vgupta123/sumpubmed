BACKGROUND
maize  is one of the important grain and feed crops in which the stalk, as one indispensable part of plant morphology, serves as the conductor of transporting water and nutrients. stalk lodging lead to yield losses estimated to range from  <dig> to 20 % annually worldwide  <cit> . rind penetrometer resistance , which is one of the reliable indicators of stalk strength, has been widely used to measure stalk strength and improve stalk lodging resistance  <cit> . maize is also one of the most important annual forage crops. in vitro dry matter digestion  has been the most useful evaluating indicator for maize forage variety examination in many european countries  <cit> . therefore, a further and better understanding of the molecular basis for rpr and ivdmd is crucial for breeding lodging-resistant and highly digestible maize  <cit> .

the genetic analysis of quantitative traits is difficult and complex in maize, and quantitative traits are affected by key genes and interacting networks of small-effect genes. therefore, different studies have provided different results including quantitative trait loci  number, distribution, and genetic effects for one trait  <cit> . this lack of conformity may also be explained by the many differences in parental materials, segregation-population types, ecological conditions, genetic maps, analytical methods and phenotype evaluation  <cit> . moreover, high genome dosage levels have effect on genetic analysis  <cit> .

due to the advantages of time-saving and high genetic variance, doubled haploid  technology is routinely used in modern maize breeding for production of homozygous parental lines for maize hybrid breeding and constructing dh populations for genetic research . although haploid populations possess the characteristics of genetic homozygosity and have one genome dosage, moderate to strong correlations have been identified between small size dh populations and their haploid version populations for some agronomic traits  <cit> . moreover, haploid lines could react more sensitively to biotic and abiotic stresses and, therefore, they would effectively uncover susceptibility to diseases and environmental constraints. in a. thaliana, the utility and power of haploid genetics had been reported. haploids can provide genetic analysis advantages that are not available in diploids, such as specifically pyramiding multiple mutant combinations, forward mutagenesis screens and swapping of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes  <cit> . in yeast, haploid screens represent an ideal platform for negative selection since a certain genetic lesion set by mutagenesis will exert equal effects in all cells  <cit> . in this regard, the haploid lines may also be interesting in the genetic architecture exploration of maize quantitative traits.

different segregating populations have been used in linkage analysis or genome-wide association study of rpr, and the genome set number of all these populations was two. the results suggested the genetic complexity of rpr. flint garcia et al.  <cit>  first detected  <dig> rpr qtl in four f2: <dig> populations, which accounted for more than 33 % of the total phenotype variation. hu et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> qtl in a ril population developed from the cross of b73 × ce <dig>  which could explain  <dig> – <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation. li et al.  <cit>  narrowed the qtl interval which had the largest effect among the  <dig> qtl of rpr detected in two ril populations by the method of haplotype analysis. peiffer et al.  <cit>  reported that  <dig> family-nested qtl and  <dig> significant gwas associations were identified for rpr across nam  and ibm  families, while numerous weak associations were found in the ncrpis  diversity panel for rpr. mutations, brittle stalk  genes exhibiting a lower proportion of cellulose, had dramatically weakened tissue mechanical strength than that of wild type stalks  <cit> .

moreover, whole plant digestibility, which can reflect the feeding value, has been extensively studied in forage maize, and several reports of qtl analyses with low-density markers for stalk digestibility in forage maize were published  <cit> . maize mutants and/or genetically engineered plants have highlighted a few genes affecting maize cell wall degradability  <cit> . reports have emerged on nucleotide diversity and the extent of linkage disequlibrium  at the gene locus of lignin and cellulose synthesis .

it was well known that plant breeders are desired to choose lines based on minimizing negative effects of genotype agronomic value, so it was crucial to perform research on the genetic architecture of stalk traits, especially for rpr and ivdmd. in this study, we first used a dh population combined with the corresponding haploid population to identify qtl and observe candidate gene expression about stalk traits. our objectives were to:  explore the genetic architecture of stalk traits;  evaluate consistence and difference in phenotype, qtl characters, and gene expression between two different ploidy populations in stalk traits; and  preliminary propose and illustrate a ploidy effect mechanism for rpr and ivdmd under one genome dosage situation with the qtl mapping method.

RESULTS

inter-population and intra-population phenotypic correlation
the phenotypic correlation coefficients of all stalk traits between the dh and haploid populations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . coefficients of phenotypic correlation among different traits in dh population showed similar patterns to those in haploid population. in both populations, adf, ndf and cel showed high positive correlation among themselves, significantly positively correlated with rpr but negatively correlated with ivdmd, lig and wsc. rpr negatively correlated with ivdmd but with different correlation coefficients in dh and haploid populations, respectively .fig.  <dig> phenotypic correlations of stalk traits between dh and haploid populations. blues of the haploid population were presented in x axis and blues of the dh population were presented in y axis

constructing a linkage map and the characteristics of markers
a total of  <dig> dh lines were used for genotyping with maizesnp3k chip, which was carried out on the illumina golden-gate snp genotyping platform  <cit>  and  <dig> high-quality snps were detected. the missing rate for these snps ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  % , the heterozygosity ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  % . a total of  <dig>  %  of the dh lines with snp heterozygosity ≥ 10 % were excluded in further analysis. minor allele frequency  for these snps ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>   . of these high-quality snps,  <dig> snps were polymorphic between the two parental lines, and the marker distribution frequency for the two parents ranged from  <dig> to 65 % . after quality control,  <dig> snps were left and used to construct a linkage map using the joinmap <dig>  instructions  <cit> . the total length of the linkage map was  <dig>  cm with an average interval of  <dig>  cm .

qtl characteristics in the dh and haploid populations
across five environments, the number and position of qtl detected in the dh and haploid populations was shown in fig.  <dig>  for each trait evaluated in this study, one or more qtl were identified in one region or even shared the same support intervals with the distance of less than 20 cm between the dh and haploid populations.fig.  <dig> genetic maps and distribution of putative rpr, ivdmd and other stalk traits qtl in dh and haploid populations. blue letters represented qtl detected in dh population. black letters represented qtl detected in haploid population



in the haploid population, four qtl for rpr were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two of which were identified on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> using the dh population . the position of qtl identified in the haploid population on chromosome  <dig> was close to that detected in the dh population, which accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the rpr genetic variation, respectively. the favorable alleles of rpr qtl were contributed by the c7- <dig> parental line in the dh population. all qtl of rpr detected in the dh and haploid populations together explained  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the rpr genetic variation, respectively. the favorable alleles of rpr qtl on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were contributed by the rpr-higher parent c7- <dig>  while the rpr-lower parent z <dig> donated the alleles on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig> qtl detected for rpr, ivdmd in dh and haploid populations, respectively

for ivdmd, three qtl were identified in each population, which explained  <dig> – <dig>  % of total genetic variation in the dh population and  <dig> – <dig>  % in haploid population these qtl were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the dh population and on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the haploid population. two qtl detected on chromosome  <dig> were tightly linked, which explained the  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of ivdmd genetic variation, respectively, and both were contributed by the ivdmd-higher parent z <dig> in the dh and haploid populations.

in the dh population, qtl of rpr, ivdmd, adf, ndf and wsc shared the same region ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on chromosome  <dig>  the qtl intervals for rpr, adf, ndf and cel detected in the haploid population ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm were completely included in the region described above. on chromosome  <dig>  qtl of ivdmd detected in the dh population and the qtl of rpr detected in the haploid population were located adjacent to each other and shared common regions with the qtl of adf, ndf and cel. two or more qtl located in bin  <dig> / <dig>  for ivdmd, adf, ndf, cel, and wsc clustered in the same chromosome region ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm in the dh and haploid populations.

candidate gene identification for rpr and ivdmd in the dh and haploid populations
with a relatively high mapping resolution, some qtl representing the small genomic regions and the linear b <dig> genome can be used for searching candidate genes related to rpr and ivdmd. based on the available annotation of the b <dig> reference sequence version 5b. <dig> , we applied the mapman bin classification  <cit>  and maizegdb website  to search for candidate genes.

in this study, four qtl which equally assigned for rpr and ivdmd in the two populations could account for more than  <dig>  % of the genetic variation. the number of genes located in the four qtl of rpr and ivdmd were different from each other based on gene screening using qteller <dig>  . nineteen genes have previously been demonstrated to be associated with cell wall formation mainly involved with cellulose and lignin synthesis  . candidate genes participating same bioprocess were predicated between the dh and haploid populations for rpr and ivdmd, which were consistent with the results proposed by previous studies  <cit> . moreover, although some evidence illustrated that some transcription factors, such as nac, r2r3-myb, c2h <dig>  c3hc <dig> transcription factors families and so on, were associated with the cell wall , there was no clear evidence and further investigation was necessary to confirm the function of other annotated genes encoding similar transcription factors.table  <dig> putative candidate genes for rpr and ivdmd in two different ploidy populations



transcriptional expression analyses of key genes involved in lignin and cellulose synthesis for haploid and diploid version of parental lines
to determine whether key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were ploidy-modulated at a transcriptional level, relative expression levels of five genes, pal, comt, ccoaomt, ccr and cad, were analyzed . in parental line z <dig>  transcript levels of the five genes increased  <dig> – <dig> folds in haploid plant relative to diploid plants. particularly, comt had the largest change fromz <dig> in diploids to z <dig> in haploids, while with no significant change from c7- <dig> in diploids to c7- <dig> in haploids. in the other parental line c7- <dig>  higher expression levels of haploids than diploids were also observed across five genes, however, the changes of expression level  from diploids to haploids were lower than what observed in z <dig> fig.  <dig> expression levels of lignin and cellulose synthesis genes in fiag rind of haploid and diploid parental lines at milky stage. quantitative rt-pcr analysis for lignin and cellulose synthesis genes was shown in the first five pictures and the last two pictures, respectively . four bars in each picture presented z <dig> haploid, z <dig> diploid, c7- <dig> haploid and c7- <dig> diploid from left to right. different lowercase indicated that statistical significant difference . error bar ± sd



we also examined expression of cellulose synthesis genes encoding glycosyltransferase which detected in both populations for rpr and ivdmd , and cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> were consistently co-expressed at all developmental stages of and were predominantly associated with the deposition of the secondary cell wall in maize stems even after the anthesis stage  <cit> . for c7- <dig>  the two genes, cesa <dig> and cesa <dig>  were up-regulated  <dig> –fold and  <dig> –fold, respectively, in the haploid version relative to the diploid version. for z <dig>  the expression of cesa <dig> increased  <dig>  fold in haploids in comparison to diploids, however, haploids had lower expression level for cesa <dig> 

discussion
performance and heritability of stalk traits in dh and haploid populations
the previous genetic investigations on rpr and ivdmd in diploid populations revealed that the traits were likely polygenic in maize and were affected by several mechanisms and complicated by confounding factors.

in this study, two parent lines presented consistent trends on rpr, as well as other traits, between the dh and haploid populations. this result showed each parent contributed coherent negative or positive allele effects even under different genome dosages and additive effect may played important role for partial phenotypic variation.

heritability estimation depended on genetic background of the material, population types surveyed, interaction with environments and experimental design  <cit> . in this study, the heritability of rpr was  <dig>  and  <dig>  estimated in dh and haploid population respectively, which were all in agreement with a high heritability of rpr reported in previous studies . however, peiffer et al.  <cit>  reported that the heritability of rpr estimated from  <dig> ril families of maize nested association mapping  population ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , which may be due to a wide range in the flowering time among nam families. likewise, a high heritability was obtained for ivdmd in both dh  and haploid  populations, which were different from a moderate heritability, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , reported in previous studies . moderate or high heritability values were obtained for other stalk traits as well. in conclusion, the high heritability values of stalk traits evaluated in this study could provide solid basis for qtl mapping analysis.

for most of traits evaluated in this study, the heritability estimated from the haploid population was higher than that from the dh population. our results were consistent with heritability of dh and its haploid populations in maize reported by geiger et al.  <cit> , although different traits were studied. the higher heritability estimated from the haploid population can be explained by the relatively smaller σg × e <dig> and σe <dig> in haploid population than in dh population, which can be explained by that haploid lines mainly reacted more sensitively than dh lines to biotic and abiotic stress and therefore effectively uncover susceptibility to diseases and outer constraints, which had been proposed by chase et al.  <cit>  and geiger et al.  <cit> . in addition, all traits evaluated in this study were measured with high precision and then had a solid genetic basis in two ploidy populations, fundamentally suggesting that the haploid population as well as the dh population could be used in qtl analysis.

phenotypic correlations and qtl co-localization for the same trait between the dh and haploid populations
geiger et al.  <cit>  reported moderate to high correlations between the dh and haploid lines from three material sets  for early vigor, silking, plant height, and stover weight per plant. we also observed a significant  moderate to strong positive correlation  between the dh and haploid populations for all stalk traits . this could suggest that moderate to strong correlations can occur independently of material background and trait restrictions. this high correlation between haploids and corresponding dh lines may provide reference information for maize breeders to select desirable lines at haploid stage, which could reduce breeding costs. however, the genetic mechanism on the connection between the dh and haploid populations has not yet been studied and therefore, is still unclear. in this study, through qtl mapping studies conducted in dh and its haploid population, we intended to understand this issue in term of genetic architecture. we first identified common qtl regions between the dh and haploid populations for each stalk trait, which could be considered as the genetic reason for the phenotypic correlation. other qtl located on different chromosomes or having larger distance  may be partially caused by the change of genome dosage and explained by the different population size. ming et al.  <cit>  reported that many qtl for sugar content detected in sugarcane autopolyploids were not consistent with known candidate genes and suggested that other approaches will be necessary to isolate the genetic determinants of high sugar content of vegetative tissues. until now, qtl detection in haploid population has not been reported.

phenotypic correlations and qtl co-localizations among different traits
in an attempt to further understand the genetic architecture of rpr and ivdmd in maize, genomic regions for rpr, ivdmd and other stalk component traits were compared and phenotypic correlations between rpr, ivdmd and other stalk component were evaluated. forty-seven qtl were identified in the dh and haploid populations . the incidence of qtl clusters in similar genomic regions reflected trait associations  <cit> .

two studies have proposed that genes associated with the biosynthesis of cell wall components were considered as candidate genes for rpr  <cit> . we also observed the positive correlations and qtl co-location of rpr with adf, ndf and cel, which were consistent with previous studies. rpr was negatively correlated with wc in a high-oil ril population  <cit> . the same correlation trend of rpr with wc and wsc were observed in the dh and haploid populations, except that rpr had no correlation with wc in the haploid population. in addition, hu et al.  <cit>  reported that the internode diameter, fresh weight of internode and dry weight of internode were also significantly positively correlated with rpr, and the difference in planting years, densities and maize varieties led to different stalk rprs  <cit> .

ivdmd showed the opposite correlation direction as the correlations of rpr with adf, ndf, cel and wsc, and had the same correlation direction as the correlations of rpr with wc. therefore, wc may be one of the improved elements for practical breeding for stalk lodging resistance and forage maize. several qtl associated with ivdmd and other stalk components were located in the same bins as identified in our studied  <cit> . lig was positively correlated with ivdmd and was not correlated with rpr, which was not in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . this may be due to the no-forage background materials used in this study. no reports were available on qtl both for rpr and ivdmd. only in the dh population evaluated in this study, we first detected one qtl cluster for rpr and ivdmd at bin  <dig>  and bin  <dig> , respectively. however, we found more than one qtl of rpr or ivdmd sharing common regions or flanking markers with the qtl of other stalk components, which suggested close linkage or pleiotropy as the explanation for the correlations and some common genes had effects on rpr and ivdmd. the qtl clusters could be deployed for improving rpr and ivdmd in maize through marker-assisted selection.

compare qtl identified in this study with those identified in previous studies in diploid populations
we have identified additive qtl for rpr on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  flint-garcia et al.  <cit>  detected one qtl region on chromosome  <dig> contained overlapping support intervals across four f2: <dig> maize populations. also, in less than four populations, other qtl were detected at bins  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> , and  <dig> . similarly, our mapping study of the dh and haploid populations identified five rpr qtl located near bins  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . hu et al.  <cit>  investigated rpr in a ril population derived from a high-oil population and reported that rpr qtl were detected on all chromosomes except for chromosome  <dig> and the qtl located in bin  <dig>  was the most important one and it accounted for 12 % of the phenotypic variation. li et al.  <cit>  identified seven rpr-associated qtl in two ril populations. among these qtl, the largest-effect qtl accounted for  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation was located at bin  <dig> , and other qtl for rpr were observed at bins  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , explaining  <dig> – <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation. in the present study, the qtl location on chromosome  <dig> were only detected in the haploid populations and accounted for  <dig>  % of the genetic variation with highly detected frequency in  <dig> runs cross-validation . moreover, it is worth noting that rpr-associated qtl, which were observed at bin  <dig>  in the haploid populations and explained more than  <dig>  % of the contribution to genetic variation, were located in the same region as qtl detected by flint-garcia et al.  <cit> . the qtl detected at bin  <dig>  in the dh population could account for the highest percentage of rpr genetic variation  and were not located in the qtl cluster with other traits, and this qtl has not been proposed by previous studies. since these two newly discovered qtl were also detected with high frequencies in the  <dig> cross-validation, this confirmed our conclusion that qtl at bins  <dig>  and  <dig>  likely carried major candidate genes for rpr .

six qtl for ivdmd in total were detected in dh and its haploid population in this study. two qtl detected in the dh and haploid populations were located in adjacent bins  <dig>  and  <dig>  with a genetic distance of less than 3 cm. these two qtl also showed high detection frequencies in cross-validation . similarly, wei et al.  <cit>  reported that a ivdmd qtl located at bin  <dig> – <dig>  were detected in pop <dig> combined analysis, which was adjacent to qtl for ivdmd on chromosome  <dig> detected in this study. other qtl for ivdmd identified in the dh and haploid populations were distributed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  ivdmd qtl located at bin  <dig>  can explain  <dig>  % of the genetic variation. previous reports showed that qtl on chromosome  <dig> had a great effect on stalk digestibility  <cit> . the qtl located at bins  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  were detected in xuchang and luoyang pop <dig>  respectively, by wei et al.  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  suggested that ivdmd qtl explained more than 10 % of the genetic variation in both f <dig> and f <dig> generations were mapped on the same genomic position on chromosome  <dig>  which were the same as qtl detected in maize recombinant inbred line progeny of f288 × f <dig>  <cit> . one ivdmd qtl detected in our study was also on chromosome  <dig>  these qtl described above were closely linked under high-density snp markers and deserve further investigation for finding candidate genes underlying ivdmd in a no-forage genetic background.

the role of genome dosage changes on gene expression of lignin and cellulose synthesis in inbred and haploids of two parental lines
most candidate genes were involved in lignin and cellulose synthesis which affect the stalk cell wall structure. lignin was a phenolic polymer that imparted mechanical strength of the plant secondary cell wall, and therefore, was considered to confer stalk rot resistance and involve in plant evolution  <cit> . particularly, genes participating in lignin synthesis were identified only in haploid population in our study. therefore, based on the gene function annotations for rpr and ivdmd qtl detected in the dh and haploid populations, we analyzed the key gene expressions of lignin and cellulose synthesis and genome dosage regulation. the expression levels and phenotypes showed several interesting results, suggesting a partial explanation for ploidy effect mechanisms in the haploid condition.

in the one dosage genome, compared to the inbred, cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> gene expressions were up-regulated except for the cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> gene in z <dig>  which was consistent with the decreased cel content in haploid z <dig> and higher content in c7- <dig> haploids . unlike other gene expressions in lignin synthesis, the comt gene showed significantly lower expression levels in c7- <dig> haploids than that in z <dig> haploids. all these results illustrated the existence of genetic variation in morphological responses to ploidy changes, which was consistent with the results which reported by riddle et al.  <cit> .

all lignin and synthesis gene expression showed dramatically inversed expression levels, except for cesa <dig> in z <dig>  as genome dosage number increased , which was consistent with higher lig contents for two parents and increased cel contents for parent line c7- <dig> in the haploid condition and can be explained by dosage compensation  <cit> . these findings implied that the major effect of genome dosage changes were not simply proportional to copy number of regulatory genes and may not be directly related to the phenotype, but rather result from various regulatory components which resulted in compensation for gene expression in the one dosage genome. previous studies had also reported that many target loci exhibited dosage compensation, such as adh expression with reduced alleles number  <cit> . quantitative traits trended to be regulated by genes exhibiting dosage effects and most were transcription factors  <cit> . forty-seven dosage-dependent modifiers operated in macromolecular complexes in a regulatory network  <cit> . many other mechanisms, such as sirna, dna methylation and so on, may be concerned with expression changes in dosage- sensitive region genes, which can also sharpen the evolution of copy-number varied regions .

CONCLUSIONS
using dh and its corresponding haploid populations, this analyse revealed important genomic regions associated with eight stalk-related traits. these qtl explained a large extent of phenotypic variance. one or more qtl sharing common region for each stalk-related trait were detected between this two different ploidy populations. the heritabilities in haploid population were higher than dh population in all stalk traits except wc. this study identified candidate genes involving in lignin and cellulose synthesis for rpr and ivdmd, which were the two most important stalk traits. the expression levels of most of these candidate genes were significant higher in haploid parents than that in corresponding diploid parents. haploid population may be used as one of platforms providing information on the genetic basis for stalk-related traits, and the genetic connection between dh and haploids for traits can facilitate the selection of materials at haploid-stage which can boost the practical maize breeding.

the dosage compensation mechanism and dosage-sensitivity genes may be further examined by analyzing the genetic architecture of certain traits by comparing qtl mapping results between different ploidy populations, which may also have important implications for understanding gene regulatory networks and genome evolution.
