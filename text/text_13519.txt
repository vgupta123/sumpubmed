BACKGROUND
ovine and caprine scrapie are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  of small ruminant livestock. tses are also reported in domestic cattle and exotic zoo-raised bovids  and in farm-raised and free-ranging cervids . human tses include a varied group of familial, sporadic, iatrogenic and infectious disorders. human variant creutzfeldt jakob disease  is a novel infectious tse apparently originating from exposure to infectious bovine tissues
 <cit>  and transmitted at low rates through blood transfusion
 <cit> . although scrapie has not demonstrated zoonotic potential, the introduction of vcjd through exposure to domestic animal food products has led to a call for global eradication of all animal tses.

tses are characterized by accumulation of a relatively protease resistant isoform  of the normal cellular prion protein , encoded by the prnp gene
 <cit> . the transmissible agent, referred to as a prion, is uniquely proteinaceous
 <cit>  and composed largely of prpsc. in all tses, prions and prpsc accumulate in the central nervous system but significant accumulation also occurs in the lymphoid tissue and placenta
 <cit>  of sheep and goats with classical scrapie. classical ovine scrapie is apparently transmitted by oral or mucosal exposure to prions shed in the placenta, blood and/or milk of infected postparturient ewes
 <cit> . susceptibility to infection with the classical ovine scrapie agent is associated with the amino acid sequence of the host prpc <cit> . selection for relatively resistant breeding stock has the potential of accelerating eradication of ovine scrapie from domestic flocks.

caprine scrapie may originate from exposure to infected sheep or infected goats. classical ovine scrapie is readily transmitted from sheep to domestic goats by experimental oral challenge with placental tissue
 <cit> . the practice of co-housing sheep and goats during parturition and the use of milk from goats for feeding orphaned lambs raise the question of whether caprine scrapie is transmissible to sheep under field conditions and if so, whether there are strains of caprine scrapie that result in novel diagnostic or transmission patterns when passaged in sheep. large animal experiments to address these issues in the natural host are expensive and time consuming, with incubation time measured in years. the introduction of transgenic mice in which the murine prnp gene is replaced by the prnp gene of the species of interest has provided an alternative means for estimating interspecies transmission potential. the purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of using the well characterized ovinized mouse strain tg <dig> as a surrogate for sheep as bioassay recipients for detection of caprine prions.

RESULTS
donor animals
brain tissue was collected from three domestic goats  and one reference domestic sheep  with naturally-acquired classical scrapie. all four animals had been identified as scrapie suspect animals based on antemortem detection of prpsc in rectal mucosal associated lymphoid tissue using immunohistochemistry. scrapie was diagnosed by postmortem detection of prpsc in the medulla at the level of the obex.

prnp genotyping was performed on the  <dig> donor samples. the reference sheep  <dig> was homozygous for the wild type ovine allele, encoding alanine at codon  <dig>  arginine at codon  <dig>  and glutamine at codon  <dig> . this genotype is identified in more than 90% of the scrapie cases diagnosed in the us
 <cit>  and canada
 <cit> . the caprine prnp gene is highly polymorphic
 <cit>  and there is no standard nomenclature for naming alleles. polymorphisms have been identified on two haplotypes, differing at codon  <dig> . goat  <dig> was homozygous for the wild type allele encoding 240p with no other polymorphisms on either strand. goat 30– <dig> was heterozygous for  <dig> alleles on the 240p backbone; the wild type allele encoding glycine at codon  <dig> and an alternative allele encoding serine at that site. goat  <dig> was heterozygous for  <dig> alleles on the 240p backbone; the wild type allele encoding isoleucine at codon  <dig> and an alternative allele encoding methionine at that site.

brain homogenates were assessed for relative prpsc levels using serial endpoint dilutions in western blot and elisa . elisa testing using a commercial kit was performed on serial two-fold dilutions of brain homogenate; the coefficient of variation  for the  <dig> samples  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> , with  <dig> of the  <dig> samples having cv of less than or equal to  <dig>  . the last serial dilution resulting in a detectable signal by either elisa or western blot analysis varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg starting wet weight tissue. inoculations were performed using a standard brain homogenate inoculum equivalent to 2 mg starting wet weight containing 71–99 mg total protein .

survival curves in bioassay mice

 <dig> are the first  and second  passage survival curves for tg <dig> mice inoculated by the intracerebral route with scrapie isolates derived either from the three naturally infected goats  or a naturally infected reference sheep . median survival times with 95% confidence intervals are reported for all isolates in table
 <dig>  p <dig> survival curves were relatively prolonged in duration and variable , with limited overlaps between curves produced by the different isolates. in contrast, p <dig> survival curves were considerably less variable and shorter in duration . per isolate, the median survival time was reduced upon second passage by 36– <dig> dpi. since the p <dig> survival curve for the isolate derived from goat  <dig> appeared biphasic, the p <dig> brain homogenate from two mice, a shorter survival time mouse  and a longer survival time mouse , were used in p <dig> for this caprine scrapie sample. a significant difference was not observed between these two subset p <dig> survival curves . thus, these two data subsets were combined for calculation of the median survival time reported for this sample in table

western blot analysis
western blot analysis of brain homogenates from donor goats  and sheep  and bioassay recipient tg <dig> mice  showed the characteristic banding pattern of proteinase k resistant prpsc. representative data are shown in figure
 <dig>  ovine and caprine brain samples co-migrated and were detected with antibodies binding the carboxyl terminus  , the amino terminus  , and the central region  . for samples derived from all tg <dig> mice, the unglycosylated band migrated with an apparent molecular weight approximately  <dig> –2 kda lower than the samples from sheep and goat donor tissues. epitope mapping demonstrated the loss of the epitope for amino terminus mab p <dig>  but conservation of the epitope for mab f99/ <dig> . <dig> . there was no evidence of a 14 kda carboxyl fragment when using mab saf84
 <cit> . 

the possibility that the apparent shift in the pk cleavage site on mouse passage was due to replication in peripheral tissues and subsequent dissemination to the brain was addressed by intraperitoneal challenge of mice with the reference sheep homogenate. electrophoretic profiles of prpsc from the brain tissue of p <dig>  or p <dig>  mice inoculated with the reference sheep brain homogenate  by the ic route  were similar to those from the brain of p <dig> mice inoculated by the intraperitoneal  route , demonstrating co-migration of brain-derived prpsc from murine samples regardless of route of inoculation. prpsc bands from tg <dig> spleen samples  had a slightly slower migration rate than those from brain samples, ruling out peripheral amplification as a mechanism for the profile shift.

glycoform analysis
glycoform analysis was performed on pk-digested homogenates of p <dig> tg <dig> brain from each of the  <dig> inoculum groups . western blots were scanned and the percent of the total density represented in each of the  <dig> prpsc bands was plotted. although identical wet weight equivalents  of each p <dig> mouse brain homogenate were loaded, the relative amount of prpsc in each sample slightly varied among mice . the relative amounts of the prpsc bands were diglycosylated > monoglycosylated > unglycosylated . notwithstanding minor differences in relative band densities, graphic display on a tri-plot clearly shows clustering of all  <dig> four scrapie isolates .

histologic scoring of vacuolization by brain region of tg <dig> mice
distribution and severity of vacuolization was assessed in p <dig> tg <dig> mice from each of the  <dig> inoculum groups. twelve regions 
 <cit>  of each second passage tg <dig> mouse and non-inoculated, age-matched mice were scored for vacuolization by a pathologist  without knowledge of inoculum group. vacuolization was not observed  within any of the twelve brain regions of non-inoculated mice except for within g <dig> where a score of “1” was recorded for one mouse; the mean  score for region g <dig> in non-inoculated mice was thus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , which is not significantly different than a score of  <dig> 

mean vacuolization scores and variation for p <dig> tg <dig> mice are shown in figure
 <dig>  the mean vacuolization scores in all inoculum groups were significantly greater than  <dig> in brain regions g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and w <dig> and w <dig>  but were not significantly different from zero in regions g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and w <dig>  mean vacuolization scores in region g <dig> were the most variable: the mean vacuolization score was significantly increased for groups derived from sheep  <dig>  and goat  <dig>  but not for goats  <dig>  and 30– <dig> .

pet blots
paraffin embedded tissue  blot analysis was performed on brain sections from one mouse in each p <dig> inoculum group and  <dig> to  <dig> mice in each of the p <dig> groups. representative data are shown in figure
 <dig>  no labeling was detected in brains from negative controls  or in samples labeled with an isotype control antibody . pk-resistant prp was visible at all  <dig> anatomic levels in sections from infected mice, with dense labeling in the striatum, ventral pallidum, claustrum, insular cortex, paraterminal body and cingulated cortex at level  <dig>  the thalamus and hypothalamus at level  <dig>  the superior colliculus and midbrain at level  <dig> and deep cerebellar nuclei and medulla at level  <dig>  there was no evidence of species-specific discriminatory labeling and no significant variation within the  <dig> caprine scrapie groups.

discussion
bioassay of tissues from scrapie infected sheep and goats demonstrated the transmissible nature of the disorder and the novel characteristics of the infectious agent well before the introduction of the prion hypothesis
 <cit> . oral and parenteral challenge demonstrated the susceptibility of goats to ovine scrapie
 <cit> . reciprocal studies examining the susceptibility of sheep to caprine scrapie are less well described. studies in the natural ruminant host are limited by the prolonged incubation time and the expense of housing large animals in biocontainment. transgenic mice expressing a prnp gene from a species of interest are a suitable surrogate host for some studies of prion disease in humans, cattle, sheep and deer
 <cit> . considerable variation is noted among transgenic strains, however, with differences in outcome associated with route of inoculation
 <cit> , transgene sequence of the regulatory and coding regions of prnp
 <cit> , and transgene expression level
 <cit> . the murine tg <dig> line expresses the ovine prnp vrq allele under the ovine prnp promotor with overexpression of prpc in the central nervous system and lymphoreticular system
 <cit> , sites of prpsc accumulation in sheep and goats. this transgenic mouse line has been useful in characterizing atypical 
 <cit>  and classical scrapie in sheep of various genotypes
 <cit> . several ovine isolates have been further characterized by serial passage to identify candidate classical scrapie strains differing in biochemical or clinical profiles in tg <dig> mice
 <cit> . in this study, we examined the use of tg <dig> mice as a surrogate for characterizing caprine scrapie bioassayed in the ovine host. we examined incubation time, neuropathological phenotype, glycoform profile, and proteinase k cleavage pattern following primary and secondary passage of brain homogenates from three goats with naturally acquired scrapie. brain tissue from a sheep homozygous for the prnp arq allele was used as a reference ovine scrapie case.

incubation times for all  <dig> inoculum groups were prolonged and variable upon primary passage to tg <dig> mice; mean incubation times were not related to elisa/western blot titer. the sample from goat  <dig> showed the widest variation in survival time on primary passage, with insidious onset at as early as 199 days and clinical signs of ataxia, weight loss and kyphosis by 206 days; survival times in some mice in this group exceeded 300 days. mice were euthanized at 199–228 days , at 253–263 days , and at greater than 331 days . subpassage of samples from mice in the short  and long  incubation groups resulted in shorter incubation periods and mean survival times with no significant difference between the short and long incubation sample recipients ; likewise, there was no significant difference among the groups of p <dig> mice from the other inocula.

several phenotypes have been described following passage of tissue from scrapie infected sheep to tg <dig> mice. notably, differences in incubation time on primary and secondary passage associated with differences in electrophoretic profiles have been described
 <cit> , particularly in sheep with alleles occurring on the arq haplotype. these cases have been reported as homozygous for alleles encoding arq at codons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the effect of other polymorphisms  has not been determined. multiple electrophoretic patterns arising from a single ovine homogenate occur as individual or mixed profiles, even when this variation was not noted in the original ovine sample
 <cit> . in our study, the electrophoretic profiles from all murine samples showed only a fast migrating unglycosylated band corresponding to a reduction of ~ <dig>  to 2 kda in apparent molecular mass when compared to the ruminant derived samples. the shift in pk cleavage site was confirmed by marked reduction of reactivity by mab p <dig>  which recognizes an epitope at ovine residues 93– <dig>  western blot analysis with antibody saf <dig> showed no evidence of a 14 kda band, ruling out a strain ch <dig> pattern
 <cit> . the pattern of prolonged incubation associated with reduced apparent molecular weight product in western blot is consistent with arq isolates characterized by thackray et al.
 <cit> , beck et al.
 <cit> , and tixador et al.
 <cit> . our observation was not based on an inherent characteristic of the tg <dig> mouse line or our methods, as samples from mice infected with vrq ovine tissues migrate at ~21 kda .

pet blots, glycoform analysis, and lesion profiles of the tg <dig> samples derived from caprine brain inoculation were remarkably consistent. the marked uniformity in survival time following secondary passage and the consistent patterns in pet blot, glycoform analysis and electrophoretic profile suggest that the caprine isolates, derived from separate herds, represent a single strain with characteristics of a predominant us ovine scrapie strain. this finding is not surprising; scrapie appears to have been introduced into the us in sheep and is observed almost exclusively in arq homozygous sheep. subsequent spread to goats is reported only rarely and there may be a limited number of caprine scrapie strains in the population. the us will expand caprine scrapie surveillance over the next 3 years as ovine scrapie nears eradication; as additional samples from goats are identified, monitoring of caprine scrapie strains in the us using biochemical methods and bioassay in tg <dig> mice should be useful in identifying any additional strains.

CONCLUSIONS
the tg <dig> mouse strain expressing the vrq allele of the ovine prnp gene is useful in detection and analysis of ovine prions. in this study, this murine strain was found to propagate prions following intracerebral inoculation with brain homogenates from goats with naturally occurring scrapie. the electrophoretic profile and incubation time on secondary passage were similar to those observed by passage of arq homozygous sheep. the high attack rate and uniform findings on pet blot, glycoform analysis and lesion profile provide a suitable baseline for examination of caprine samples identified in the expanded us caprine scrapie surveillance program.
