BACKGROUND
the oncidiinae subtribe of the orchidaceae family, consisting of about  <dig> closely related genera with over  <dig> species, is divided into five alliances, with oncidium as its largest genus  <cit> . from the perspective of cellular biology, ecology and morphology, oncidium is the most diverse genus in the orchidaceae. traditionally, the taxonomy of the oncidiinae tribe is based on the morphology of the flower  <cit> ; however, morphology is affected by environmental factors, and over time flower morphologies have evolved convergently. the positions of some species in the evolution and taxonomy of oncidiinae are therefore difficult to identify. accurate identification is further complicated by the ease with which oncidiinae can be crossed intergenerically, as indicated by the  <dig> intergeneric hybrids reported  <cit>  and the fact that more than  <dig> hybrids  have been re-distributed into other genera.

different molecular marker techniques such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism , arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction , dna amplification fingerprinting , and random amplification polymorphism dna ] are available to conduct genetic analyses by pcr and provide information about evolution that is useful for taxonomy. tsai et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> rapd markers to investigate the relationships between  <dig> species of oncidiinae, and found that the species could be separated into seven groups; however, tsai and colleagues were unable to identify the more detailed relationships among these species.

although there are three different genomes in plants, chloroplast dna  is in many respects the genome of choice for taxonomic studies in orchids  <cit>  as well as other species  <cit> . there are many advantages to using cpdna for taxonomy and evolutionary research:  the size of cpdna is small, with high copy number and simple structure;  when compared to the mitochondrial and nuclear genome, cpdna gene content and arrangement are more conserved, making it easier to design primers and clone genes;  cpdna is maternally inherited and thus without the genetic reassortment that interferes with the molecular phylogenetic relationships  <cit> .

the chloroplast genome is a circular chromosome of 120~ <dig> kb that consists of two inverted repeats , a large single-copy region , and small single-copy region . this conserved structure and sequence information provides a resource for primer design for other cpdna sequencing by pcr  <cit> . this approach has been used for the sequencing of two bamboo cpdna genomes  <cit> . as chloroplast genome of one member of the orchidaceae family, phalaenopsis aphrodite, has already been published  <cit> , it is very useful to sequence complete cpdna from another orchid, such as oncidium using pcr.

the chloroplast genome also has applications in plant biotechnology. chloroplast genetic engineering offers a number of unique advantages, including high levels of transgene expression, multi-gene engineering in a single transformation event, transgene containment via maternal inheritance and a lack of gene silencing and position effects  <cit> . however, the lack of complete chloroplast genome sequences is still a major limitation to extending this technology. additional information about the chloroplast genome would, thus, be of great value in advancing orchid biotechnology.

in this study, we designed primers based on the p. aphrodite cpdna and used them to identify the cpdna of onc. gower ramsey, an important cut flower orchid. such primers were also used to investigate the nadh dehydrogenase  gene deletion patterns in  <dig> members of the oncidiinae, and sequence amplified dna regions to undertake phylogenetic analyses broadly across the angiosperms and at the species level.

methods
plant materials
fifteen commercial oncidiinae varieties were obtained from a grower  in taichung, taiwan, including four oncidium , five beallara , two odontoglossum , two odontocidium , one degarmoara  and one zelenkocidium . these orchids were maintained in the greenhouse at academia sinica, taipei, taiwan, and vouchers specimens were deposited at the national natural and science museum, taichung, taiwan. leaves from these orchids were used in this study. details of the parents of these species are shown in figure  <dig> 

dna purification, primer design and genomic pcr
the pcr strategy for sequencing the chloroplast genome was adapted from wu et al.  <cit> . for the chloroplast genomic pcr analysis, total genomic dna from greenhouse-grown plants was isolated using a urea extraction buffer system  <cit> . the coding regions of the p. aphrodite chloroplast genome were used as the templates for primer design. a series of overlapping dna fragments of  <dig> to  <dig> kb were amplified using specific primers . the overlaps between adjacent pcr fragments were about  <dig> bp. the pcr amplification program consisted of  <dig> cycles of at 94°c for  <dig> s, at 55°c for  <dig> s and at 72°c for  <dig> s. the pcr products were sequenced. dna sequencing was carried out with the big-dye terminator cycle sequencing kit using an abi prism  <dig>  dna analyzer . all gaps were filled by designing new primers on the basis of sequences obtained from pcr products . the sequences were verified by comparison with the chloroplast genome of p. aphrodite using the vectornti alignx software program .

broad phylogenetic analysis
analyses of  <dig> species were performed using the same  <dig> conserved protein-coding genes analyzed in previous studies  <cit> . this set of loci was assembled from the aligned nexus file for  <dig> species that is supplemental to the paper by hansen et al. . also included were sequences from lemna minor , joinvillea plicata , and hordeum vulgare  to increase sampling among monocots and break up putative long branches. gaps introduced by the alignment were excluded from phylogenetic analyses. two phylogenetic methods were used-- maximum likelihood , implemented in garli vers.  <dig> - <dig>  <cit> , and maximum parsimony , implemented in paup* vers.  <dig> b <dig>  <cit> . ml analyses were run under the general time reversible model, with all parameters estimated. a heuristic search of  <dig> random addition replicates was conducted for the mp analyses. nonparametric bootstrap analyses were also performed with  <dig>  or  <dig>  pseudoreplicates  <cit> . ginkgo biloba was the specified outgroup for all analyses  <cit> .

contig assembly and annotation
vectornti contig express was used to assemble contigs . the chloroplast genome was annotated using dogma   <cit> . this program uses a fasta-formatted input file of the complete genomic sequences and identifies putative protein-coding genes by performing blastx searches against a custom database of published chloroplast genomes. both trnas and rrnas were identified by blastn searches against the same database of chloroplast genomes. for genes with low sequence identity, manual annotation was performed after identifying the position of the start and stop codons, as well as the translated amino acid sequence, using the chloroplast/bacterial genetic code.

analysis of variability in ndh genes of  <dig> oncidium varieties
to investigate the ndh genes of oncidiinae, six cpdna regions  were obtained by a pcr approach from the  <dig> varieties as indicated in methods . the primer sequences, sequence size and sequence position in onc. gower ramsey of these regions in onc. gower ramsey are shown in figure  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> oncidium varieties
to investigate the phylogenetic relationships between oncidiinae at the species level, eight cpdna regions  were obtained by pcr from plastid dna of the leaves of the  <dig> varieties as above . the primer sequences, sequence size and sequence position of these regions in onc. gower ramsey are shown in figure  <dig>  phylogenetics were conducted using mega <dig>   <cit> . the evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum parsimony, minimum evolution , neighbor-joining  and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean methods. in these four analyses, the bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from  <dig> replicates  <cit> . branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in < 50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. the values of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  are shown next to the branches  <cit> .

RESULTS
oncidium chloroplast genome sequencing
the size of the onc. gower ramsey chloroplast genome is  <dig>  bp . the genome includes a pair of irs of  <dig>  bp each, a ssc region of  <dig>  bp, and a lsc region of  <dig>  bp. the onc. gower ramsey chloroplast genome contains  <dig> different genes, of which  <dig> are duplicated in the ir, giving a total of  <dig> genes. there are  <dig> distinct trnas, six of which are duplicated in the ir. sixteen genes contain one or two introns, with six of the introns in trnas. coding regions make up  <dig> % of the chloroplast genome  and non-coding regions, which contain intergenic spacer  regions and introns, comprise  <dig> %. the overall gc and at content of the chloroplast genome is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the gene order of onc. gower ramsey cpdna is similar to that of the orchid p. aphrodite . the rps <dig> gene is not included in the ir. in contrast with the chloroplast genomes of poaceae, onc. gower ramsey contained introns in the clpp and rpoc <dig> loci and had intact copies of the accd, and ycf <dig> genes, which are incomplete or entirely missing in poaceae.

the broad phylogenetic analysis resulted in two trees, an ml tree with -lnl =  <dig>   and an mp tree of  <dig>  steps and  <dig>  parsimony informative characters. the mp tree had a a consistency index  of  <dig>  and a retention index of  <dig>  . the topologies of the monocot subtrees were identical for the two analyses in which oncidium was maximally supported as the sister of phalaenopsis and the two orchids were united with yucca, another representative of asparagales, with maximum support.

analysis of variability in ndh genes of  <dig> oncidium species
six cp dna regions  were obtained by pcr from total dna of the leaves of the  <dig> varieties. most of the ndh genes in the  <dig> oncidiinae varieties, with the exception of ndhe in some species, had no function . in all  <dig> of the oncidiinae varieties studied, the ndhj gene was truncated  and the ndhk gene was absent . in ndhc, a frame shift occurred, creating a stop codon in the middle of the gene in all oncidiinae, including onc. gower ramsey, resulting from a  <dig> bp deletion .

the ndhb of oncidiinae does not function due to a stop codon in the first exon. to date, six orchid ndhb genes, including p. aphrodite, have been cloned and published in the ncbi database. two of them could translate putative functional ndhb protein . there is also a frame shift in the second exon of cypripedium passerinum . that of odontoglossum crispum  is only a partial sequence that could translate a putative ndhb protein.

the ndhf locus, which is located in the lsc-ira junction, was absent in the oncidiinae varieties. notably, the nucleotide deletions in the trnracg-trnnguu-ndhf-rpl <dig> region were different between p. aphrodite and oncidiinae .

all of the  <dig> oncidiinae ndhd genes cloned here were truncated. the overall pattern of truncation can be classified into two types: a truncation occurring at the 3'-end of ndhd  and a truncation in the 5'-end  .

the sequences of onc. gower ramsey varieties, onc. sweet sugar and odm. margarete holm indicate that the translation capacity of ndhe is retained in these species . of the species with modified ndhe genes, odm. violetta. von holm, odcdm. golden gate and odcdm. wildcat contained frame shifts; dgmra. flying high had a  <dig> bp deletion; and there were deletions of over  <dig> bp in the four beallara varieties .

although nine varieties had no deletions in the ndhg genes, these varieties had three internal stop codons within ndhg, rendering ndhg inactive . there was a deletion of about  <dig> bp in the ndhg gene of the beallara species .

the region encompassing ndhi is the most complicated of the chloroplast ndh gene regions. generally, genes from the same genus had the same pattern . in the onc. gower ramsey varieties, the ndhi gene was partially deleted, and in the beallara varieties, zelenkocidium little angel and odm. violetta. von holm, the ndhi gene was completely absent.

truncated ndha-ndhh genes still existed in most of the oncidiinae species in this study. with the exception of frame shifts in oncdm. garfield ndha and oncdm. golden gate ndhh, the other ndha through ndhh genes in the other five genera all showed deletions of various types.

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> oncidium species
based on the amount of variation in the cpdna and congruence with parent relationships, certain chloroplast regions were determined to be more useful than others. because rbcl is highly conserved; bootstrap scores are lower then 50% and are not useful for determining parent relationship . using the accd gene, only the species belonging to beallara and oncidium could be separated as the pattern and relationships among other species were not correlated with the parent relationship .

in the matk region, the phylogenetic analysis of these sequences and  <dig> economic varieties gave results that correlated with parent relationship . therefore, we combined the most diverse cpdna regions, trnh -psba  <cit> , matk and trnfgaa-ndhj  <cit> , for phylogenetic analysis. the trnhgug-psba and ndhj combination provided the most similar results to those obtained from all eight cpdna regions .

discussion
using pcr to sequencing oncidium gower ramsey and phylogenomic applications
although there are many methods for cp genome sequencing, pcr is one method that is easy and economical  <cit> . however, the gene content and order in monocot cp genomes is relatively diverse so that the use of the p. aphrodite as a template for primer design in this study was limiting. this was especially true in the ndh gene regions where the deletion of ndh genes in oncidium is very different from that in p. aphrodite. furthermore, when using pcr methods with total genomic dna as the template, some of the cp sequence regions are similar to those in other organelles, thus raising the possibility of false results. to prevent such results, we used blast analysis and different combinations of primers to amplify the same region.

considerable effort is being expended to investigate phylogenomic relationships among monocots using cp genomes . here, the phylogenetic position of orchidaceae among asparagales is confirmed with the robust support provided by many informative cpdna characters. further sampling among orchids in the future phylogenomic studies building on our results will clarify the complex relationships within the large family. therefore, the cpdna of oncidium gower ramsey provides valuable information for further orchid cp genome sequencing and phylogenomics.

ndh genes in oncidiinae cpdna
in higher plant chloroplasts, the nadh dehydrogenase  complex functions in psi cyclic electron flow and chlororespiration  <cit> . eleven subunits of the chloroplast ndh genes  are encoded in the chloroplast genome. in addition  <dig> cyanobacterial orthologs, nuclear-encoded subunits genes , have also been identified in chloroplasts  <cit> . this indicates that nucleus-encoded ndh genes originated in cyanobacteria and were transferred from the chloroplast genome to the nuclear genome during evolution  <cit> . however, in onc. gower ramsey, out of all the  <dig> chloroplast-encoded ndh genes, only ndhe theoretically translates into a functional protein. this ndh gene truncation and absence was also observed in p. aphrodite  <cit> . using a pcr approach to sequence the ndh genes of  <dig> varieties, we demonstrated that truncation and absence of ndh genes from the cp is a general phenomenon in oncidiinae.

the loss-of-function of ndh genes or other chloroplast-encoded genes occurs in many plants, such as parasitic plants  <cit>  and achlorophyllous orchids  <cit> . loss-of-function in ndh genes occurs not only in heterotrophic plants, but also in autotrophic species. in pinus thunbergii, all  <dig> ndh genes were putative loss-of-function alleles  <cit> , and in another coniferales species, keteleeria davidiana, was also found to contain nonfunctional ndh genes  <cit> . in three gnetophytes, which comprise three related families of woody gymnosperms , all  <dig> ndh genes are non-functional,  <dig> being absent and one, ndhb, being a pseudogene  <cit> . it is interesting to note that this ndh deletion does not occur in all gymnosperm species. the ndh genes exist in the chloroplast genomes of cryptomeria and cycas  <cit> . it is possible that ancestral plastid ndh genes were transferred to the nucleus, remaining functional to this day  <cit> .

loss-of-function ndh genes also occur in other orchids  <cit> . phaelenopsis aphrodite lacks the ndha, ndhf, and ndhh genes, and only remnants of the other eight subunits sequences were found  <cit> . the  <dig> ndh genes were either truncated or frame-shifted, suggesting that they are nonfunctional  <cit> . in this report, we demonstrated that ndh gene deletion is also common in oncidiinae: the deletion pattern differs not only between oncidium and phalaenopsis , but even within the  <dig> oncidiinae species analyzed .

from a physiological view, since parasitic plants obtain organic nutrients from the host, loss of functional ndh genes from the chloroplast is not surprising. however, this does not explain why most ndh genes are non-functional or deleted in autotrophic plants. the presence of ndh homologs encoded within the nucleus was confirmed using pcr assays of total dna of phalaenopsis  <cit> . the resulting sequences are in frame and imply that the ancestral functional ndh copies of the plastid genome may have been transferred to the nuclear genome  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> oncidium species
because it is easy to perform interspecific or intergeneric crosses with orchids, there are many artificial intergeneric hybrids. these hybrids are not distinct phenotypically and are partially named according to their parental background. however, hybrids with different parental backgrounds may be classified into the same genus. in addition, hybrids from differently named genera may originate from the same female parent. economic varieties of orchids are generally hybrids of other hybrids and some of the parental information has been lost. to further complicate matters, changes in the names of genera and taxonomy of the oncidiinae are frequent. in  <dig>  the names of more than  <dig> hybrids comprising some 20% of the oncidium group were changed. for example, colmanara wildcat was changed to odcdm. wildcat and oncidium little angel was changed to zelenkocidium little angel. these changes and whether there were grounds for them could be clarified by looking carefully at the cpdna, which could identify the female parent.

among the eight sequences studied here, the phylogenetic analysis using matk was most well-correlated with the parent relationship . there are at least three advantages of using the matk region for phylogenetic analysis:  this region is variable at the interspecies level  <cit> ;  this region is easy to amplify using published primer sequences  <cit> ; and  a large amount of sequence information about oncidiinae matk is readily available in the public domain, including the number of sequences  and the length of the sequences . here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis by using  <dig> varieties and their  <dig> related sequences. among the results we found several areas of divergence between the taxonomy of oncidiinae based on morphology and our phylogenetic analyses. for example, the female parent of beallara is miltassia, making the grandparent brassia. the sequences of beallara were highly correlated with other brassia species, and most closely with the female parent brassia verrucosa . however, the phylogenetic analysis of these sequences showed that the odontoglossum matk was dispersed around the oncidium group . result such as these suggests that analysis of a single region may not contain enough information for interspecies phylogenetic analysis.

to solve this problem, available sequence information must be increased. during phylogenetic analysis, correlation is dependent on the length and properties of dna or amino acid information. because the information on orchid cpdna is limited, the combination of several sequences derived by pcr using universal primers could be a successful strategy . in this report, eight sequences from each species were combined  and were well-correlated with the parent relationship. however, to manage labor and supply costs, we wanted to identify the smallest region that would result in the same performance as using all eight regions. therefore, we combined divergent cpdna sequences such as matk for further analyses. in addition to matk, the trnhgug-psba region is another divergent cpdna region useful for phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . various expansions or contractions of inverted repeats  in chloroplast genomes lead to diverse trnhgug-psba regions  <cit> . the structural changes in cpdna provide useful phylogenetic inferences  <cit> . according to these data, the trnhgug-psba regions are information-rich and could be used for phylogenetic analysis.

in addition, ndh gene deletion is a unique feature that may also provide useful information for parentage analysis. the trnfgaa-ndhj-ndhk-ndhc region could be amplified by pcr in all of the  <dig> varieties. therefore, different combinations of these information-rich regions  were used for phylogenetic analysis. according to our results, two variable cpdna regions, trnhgug-psba and trnfgaa-ndhj, could provide sufficient information for genus-to-species level phylogenetic analysis.

however, several questions require further investigation. the first is the placement of odm. violetta von holm, whose female parent is odm. bictoniense. irrespective of the cpdna template, odm. violetta von holm did not correlate with odcdm. golden gate or odm. margarete holm, which are both derived from the same female parent. the second is the placement of dgmra. flying high, which has the female parent mtssa. jet setter. theoretically, the cpdna of dgmra. flying high should be closely related to beallara species, which are derived from a miltassia female parent; however our data indicated that dgmra. flying high is more similar to odontoglossum.

there are many advantages to using cpdna for phylogenetic and parentage analysis. but this genetic information is only derived from the female parent. therefore, in the future nuclear genes also need to be analyzed for parentage analysis  <cit> . in pleione, the nrits region was found to be more variable than the plastid regions sequenced, and nrits gene trees were largely congruent with those inferred from the plastid regions  <cit> . our data here suggest that the taxonomy of the oncidiinae may be improved by both chloroplast and nuclear genome analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we used p. aphrodite as a prototype to design primers to complete the onc. gower ramsey genome sequence. the primers and the genome sequence information obtained will be useful for further orchid cpdna sequencing and broad phylogenetic analyses among monocots. gene annotation showed that most of the ndh genes in oncidiinae are non-functional, with the exception of ndhe, which could theoretically produce a functional protein. in the previous reports, non-functionality of ndh genes has been found in photosynthetic orchids and gymnosperms, such as in pinus thunbergii and phalaenopsis. in this report, using a pcr approach, we identified the ndh genes in different oncidiinae plants. the ndh genes were also non-functional in most of the plants tested, except for ndhe in four oncidium species and odm. margarete holm. these genes would be useful for parentage analysis. the non-protein coding regions trnhgug-psba and trnfgaa-ndhj were also determined to be cpdna regions that would be the most useful for phylogenetic analysis. when these regions were checked in commercial varieties, most confirmed to previously known inheritance information; however, some variations need further investigation. also, to confirm and complement the results obtained from cpdna, genetic information may also be derived from nuclear dna. we conclude that complete chloroplast genome information is useful for plant phylogenetic and evolutionary studies in oncidium breeding and variety identification.
