BACKGROUND
gene networks are constantly subject to noise or fluctuations, which originate from variations in transcription, translation, and environmental conditions. the stochastic nature of gene networks has been the focus of many studies . there are at least three types of fluctuations that affect gene network dynamics: 1) intrinsic noise or fast fluctuations, 2) extrinsic noise or slow fluctuations, and 3) periodic dna replication-dependent oscillations  <cit> . intrinsic noise arises from the inherent randomness during transcription and translation, key processes for gene expression  <cit> . extrinsic noise arises from the factors that universally affect the expression of all genes in a given cell, such as variations in the number of rna polymerase, ribosome, etc.  <cit> . the third type of fluctuation is due to periodic dna replication in growing and dividing cells  <cit> .

nevertheless, gene networks are usually able to perform their regulatory functions under the influence of such disturbances  <cit> , which provokes the question: how do they manage to achieve this remarkable robustness? in control theory, it is known that feedback, a situation in which two  dynamical sub-systems are connected in a way that their dynamics are coupled, can make a system resilient towards disturbances  <cit> . a well-known example of feedback in the context of gene networks is negative auto-regulation, in which a transcription factor represses the transcription of its own gene and reduces the effects of noise exerted on the transcription process  <cit> .

another example is the p53-mdm <dig> negative feedback, in which p <dig> transcriptionally activates mdm <dig>  an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, while mdm <dig> targets p <dig> for degradation   <cit> . as one of the most studied tumor suppressor proteins  <cit> , p <dig> plays a key role in repairing dna damage, arresting cell cycle and, when damage is beyond repair, activating apoptosis   <cit> . therefore, it is important for the cell to regulate p <dig> robustly, because disturbances may trigger unwanted cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. we have previously shown that the p53-mdm <dig> negative feedback can reject disturbances and improve robustness under normal  conditions  <cit> . intuitively, the negative feedback tries to compensate for changes in the p <dig> level, so that the impact of any disturbances is offset or at least attenuated.

the feedback is suppressed to stop disturbance rejection during dna-damage. within minutes of exposure to dna-damaging agents , the p <dig> protein level increases rapidly without any significant change in the p <dig> mrna level, for p <dig> is stabilized and no longer degraded by mdm <dig> at the normal rate  <cit> . the suppression of the feedback and the stoppage of disturbance rejection allow external factors such as atm to modulate p <dig> in response to stress  <cit> , which can result in pulses or sustained oscillation of p <dig>  <cit>  . therefore, the feedback mechanism is adaptive – under normal conditions the feedback rejects disturbance to maintain a low steady level of p <dig> whereas upon dna damage, the feedback is inactivated to allow pulses or oscillation  <cit>  .

interestingly, even though the negative feedback is stronger in normal conditions to reject disturbances, it is well known that feedback can also cause instability, which leads to transient fluctuation  and oscillation  <cit> . both the strength and the delay of a negative feedback can contribute to instability. as previous measurements showed, the transcriptional regulation of mdm <dig> by p <dig> has a noticeable delay  <cit>  . therefore, to maintain a steady p <dig> level in normal conditions, the p53-mdm <dig> feedback faces a dilemma: the stronger the feedback is to reject disturbances at the steady state, the more likely the feedback will become unstable and cause transient or sustained fluctuations. the feedback has to carefully balance the trade-off between steady-state and transient errors for disturbance rejection  <cit> .

does the p53-mdm <dig> feedback adopt any strategy to optimize this trade-off? it is intriguing that in this negative feedback loop mdm <dig> downregulates p <dig> through a post-translational mechanism , which is not as energy efficient as transcriptional repression because p <dig> is being produced and actively degraded simultaneously. however, post-translational regulation has distinct dynamic properties and is relatively faster than transcriptional regulation, so it is conceivable that post-translational regulations provides an advantage over transcriptional regulation in terms of the robustness-stability trade-off despite its less energy efficiency. to test this hypothesis, we used techniques from feedback control and adaptive estimation theories to analyze the p53-mdm <dig> feedback loop.

RESULTS
p53-mdm <dig> feedback model
to study the p53-mdm <dig> feedback, we started with a previously published p53-mdm <dig> feedback model that matches experimental measurements  <cit>  and added a term representing atm :

  dxtdt= <dig> 

  dytdt=pzyzt−pxyxt−pyyt 

  dztdt=−pyzyt−pzzt 

where x, y, and z represent atm, mdm <dig>  and p <dig> levels, respectively. in eq.  <dig>  since atm is inactive under normal conditions, the atm levels are assumed to be low and constant and the rate of change is zero. eq.  <dig> is composed of the p53-dependent production of mdm <dig> , atm-dependent suppression of mdm <dig> , and mdm <dig> degradation . eq.  <dig> is composed of the mdm2-dependent suppression of p <dig>  and p <dig> degradation . note that all the parameter values are supposed to be positive. following the practice in the published model  <cit> , eq.  <dig> does not include the constant basal production rate because it has no effect on the frequency domain and disturbance rejection analysis we will perform next  <cit> . a discrete-time model for the p53-mdm <dig> feedback system was also built for parameter estimation, which will be described in later sections of the paper.

feedback reduces steady-state error
eq.  <dig> is rather generic and can represent alternative p <dig> suppression mechanisms by mdm <dig>  a transcriptional mechanism would only affect pyz in the first term because the strength of transcriptional suppression only depends on the number of mdm <dig> molecules  but not on the number of p <dig> protein molecules. in contrast, a post-translational mechanism would affect both pyz  and pz , because the degradation rate of p <dig> depends on both the number of p <dig> molecules and the number of mdm <dig> molecules. this generic equation enables us to derive a common set of equations to compare the loop dynamics between transcriptional and translational regulation.

eqs. 1– <dig> can be represented as a block diagram using the laplace transform  <cit>  . x, y, and z denote the laplace transforms of x, y, and z respectively. e is the difference, or error, between the input, pxyx, and the output, pzyz. d represents any disturbance exerted on p <dig>  gy and gz are the transfer functions that represent the mdm <dig> and p <dig> systems as we showed previously  <cit> :

  gys=1s+py,gzs=1s+pz 

from figure 2a, e can be expressed as  <cit> :

  es=zspzy−xspxy→zs=es+xspxypzy 

from the same figure, z can be expressed as:

  zs=−esgyspyzgzs+dsgzs 

substituting eq.  <dig> for z into eq.  <dig>  we obtain:

  es+xspxypzy=−esgypyzgz+dgz→es=−pxy1+pyzpzygysgzsx+pzygzs1+pyzpzygysgzsd 

the second term in eq.  <dig> represents the contribution to e from d, the laplace transform of the disturbance signal. we denote this term as ed and its corresponding time domain function as ed:

  eds=ledt=pzygzs1+pzygyspyzgzsds 

using the final value theorem and assuming a step disturbance  = 1/s), we can determine the steady-state error due to the disturbance as follows:

  limt→∞edt=lims→0sed=lims→0spzygzs1+pzygyspyzgzsd=pzypypypz+pyzpzy 

according to eq.  <dig>  increasing either pyz or pz will reduce the steady-state error, because both terms are only in the denominator. therefore, either a stronger negative feedback through the mdm <dig> suppression of p <dig>  or less stable p <dig>  can reduce the steady-state error. interestingly, as stated previously, post-translational degradation of p <dig> by mdm <dig> increases both pyz and pz , while a hypothetical transcriptional suppression would only increase pyz. hence post-translational suppression of p <dig> may be more efficient at reducing steady-state error than transcriptional suppression, even though it is less energy efficient.

trade-off between steady-state and transient errors
the feedback has to minimize its transient response to disturbances in addition to steady-state error; otherwise, a temporary overshoot of the p <dig> level may trigger unintended effects. we therefore examine the percentage overshoot , which is the amount that the p <dig> level transiently overshoots the final steady-state level . because %os is a function of the damping ratio , we derive a second-order transfer function representative of the block diagram in figure 2a to determine its damping ratio . substituting eq.  <dig> for e in eq.  <dig>  the transfer function g, which directly relates the input x to the output z, can be expressed as:

  zs=zspzy−xspxygypyzgz+dgz→zs=pxygyspyzgzsxs1+pzygyspyzgzs+dsgzs1+pzygyspyzgzs→gs=zsxs=pxygyspyzgzs1+pzygyspyzgzs=pxypyzs2+py+pzs+pypz+pyzpzy 

from eq.  <dig>  the natural frequency and damping ratio can be expressed as  <cit> :

  ωnnaturalfrequency=pypz+pyzpzy 

  ζdampingratio=py+pz2pypz+pyzpzy 

and the %os is given by  <cit> :

  %os=100·e−ςπ1−ς <dig> 

the typical time responses  for a second-order system with different damping ratios are shown in figure 2b . the %os, or overshoot of the p <dig> level, decreases when the damping ratio increases .

according to eq.  <dig>  increasing pyz monotonically reduces the damping ratio and increases %os, for pyz only appears in the denominator. since, transcriptional suppression can only influence pyz, a transcriptional negative feedback is limited by the trade-off between steady-state error and transient overshoot – increasing the strength of the negative feedback reduces steady-state error at the expense of increasing transient overshoot.

on the other hand, how does pz affect the overshoot? if we take the partial derivative of the damping ratio in regard to pz, we get:

  ∂ζ∂pz=pypz+pyzpzy−pypy+pz2pypz+pyzpzy2pypz+pyzpzy 

  ∂ζ∂pz=0⇒pz=py−2pyzpzypy 

the second-order partial derivative of eq.  <dig> shows that ζ reaches the minimum value at pz=py−2pyzpzypy. when pz<py−2pyzpzypy, ζ decreases with pz; when pz>py−2pyzpzypy, ζ increases with pz. this suggests that when pz>py−2pyzpzypy, increasing pz can decrease both the steady-state error and overshoot . this insight potentially explains why cells choose to spend extra energy producing and then actively degrading p <dig> under normal conditions – it rejects disturbances by reducing both the steady-state error and the transient overshoot. furthermore, post-translational suppression influences both pyz and pz, because the mdm2-mediated degradation rate of p <dig> depends on both mdm <dig> and p <dig> concentrations. this suggests that post-translational suppression can achieve a better trade-off than transcriptional suppression, which can only influence pyz.

to quantitatively verify these analytical insights, we calculated the steady-state error, damping ratio, and %os using published, experimentally measured parameter values   <cit> , pz =  <dig>  h- <dig>   <cit> ). as pyz increases from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the steady-state error decreases while the %os increases  . hence there is a trade-off between steady-state error and transient overshoot , consistent with the previous analysis. any further decrease of the steady-state error from the system operating point  will have to pay a hefty penalty for transient overshoot. on the other hand, as pz is increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the %os initially increases but then decreases , exactly as eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> have indicated. the system operates at a point  where pz≥py−2pyzpzypy, which allows the system to reduce both the steady-state error and %os through pz . the combined effect of pyz and pz is shown in figure 3c and d. the steady-state error can be decreased by either increasing pyz or pz , but increasing pyz can increase %os , as shown by the arrows in the figures. therefore, by modulating both pyz and pz, post-translational suppression can achieve better steady-state error and %os than transcriptional suppression, which only modulates pyz.

interestingly, the fact that pz can improve both steady-state error and %os seems to suggest that cells should keep increasing pz to achieve ever better robustness. however, it is worth noting that there is another trade-off factor that ultimately comes into the picture, which is the energy cost. higher pz means that the cells have to spend more resources to rapidly produce and then degrade p <dig> in a “futile” cycle, so the degradation rate cannot be increased indefinitely. the cell has to balance between robustness and energy spending to achieve the optimal operating point.

altogether, our analytical and quantitative analyses suggest that cells spend extra energy to produce and degrade p <dig> simultaneously under normal conditions in order to maintain a more robust p <dig> level. by modulating both pyz and pz, post-translational suppression of p <dig> enables the p53-mdm <dig> feedback to achieve a better trade-off by reducing both steady-state errors and transient overshoots. on the contrary, transcriptional suppression only modulates pyz, which does not improve the overall trade-off.

robustness analyses with pole plots
as mentioned at the beginning of the paper, gene networks fluctuate over time under the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic noise. the range of pyz and pz in figure  <dig> demonstrated the robustness trade-off between steady-state and transient disturbance rejection, but it will be useful to examine the trade-off within the range of parameter fluctuation that a realistic cell has to experience. to estimate the time-varying parameter values from time-series data of the p53-mdm <dig> network  <cit> , we constructed a corresponding discrete-time model, which can be described by eqs. 16–18:

  xi=xi− <dig> 

  yi=wzyzi−1−wxyxi−1+wyyi− <dig> 

  zi=−wyzyi−1+wzzi− <dig> 

where x, y, and z represent atm, mdm <dig>  and p <dig> levels respectively. as before, the atm level is assumed to be low and constant under normal conditions. wxy represents the suppression of mdm <dig> by atm, wyz represents the suppression of p <dig> by mdm <dig>  wzy represents the transcriptional activation of mdm <dig> by p <dig>  wy represents the stability of mdm <dig> , and wz represents the stability of p <dig> . note that wy and wz represent stability rather than degradation, opposite to py and pz. block diagram representation of the discrete-time feedback model is shown in figure 2d. consistent with the continuous model, the discrete-time model confirms that the steady-state error can be decreased by increasing wyz or decreasing wz . note that decreasing wz means increasing p <dig> degradation and corresponds to increasing pyz.

  limi→∞edi==wzy1−wy1−wy1−wz+wyzwzy 

we used the time-series experimental data  <cit>  and an nlms adaptive filter  <cit>  to track the time-varying parameters of the p53-mdm <dig> model  . the published experimental data  <cit>  and matlab code used to estimate the parameter ranges are included in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  based on the estimates, we examined how wyz and wz affect %os.

using z-transform  <cit> , we first derived a transfer function, g, which represents the feedback system shown as the block diagram in figure 2d :

  gz=zzxz=wxygyzwyzgzz1+wzygyzwyzgzz=wxywyzz2−wy+wzz+wywz+wyzwzy 

to investigate the transient behavior and stability of g, we plotted its poles using the matlab robust control toolbox , which can be reproduced using the supplementary matlab file . for each map,  <dig> points were calculated based on monte carlo sampling of the estimated parameter range in figure 4a. we first plotted the poles for the dna damage condition, under which the mdm <dig> suppression of p <dig>  is weakened to stop disturbance rejection . consistent with the weakening of the feedback, the plot shows that the poles are mostly real and the system is stable, with damping ratios ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

western blot measurements of the total and ubiquitinated p <dig> levels showed that the suppression of p <dig> is  <dig>  fold higher under the normal condition compared to the dna damage condition  <cit> . we first increased wyz by  <dig>  fold  to evaluate how transcriptional suppression will affect transient overshoot and stability. the increased wyz values shifted poles higher on the map compared to the dna damage condition . the bigger imaginary components of the poles indicate that the damping ratios are lower  and the corresponding %os values are higher for the system, therefore confirming our previous conclusion that transcriptional suppression reduces the steady-state error at the expense of transient overshoot and stability.

however, if the increase of wyz is accompanied by a decrease of wz  by  <dig>  fold , which approximates post-translational suppression, the poles are located closer to the real axis. the smaller imaginary components of the poles indicate that the damping ratios are greater . therefore, post-translational suppression can reduce the steady-state error without a hefty penalty of transient overshoot  and stability, unlike transcriptional suppression.

post-translational regulation enables faster responses with predictable level shifts
post-translational regulation has another benefit over transcriptional regulation – it enables faster responses with more consistent amplitude. this is biologically significant, as cells must react quickly to external modulators  and stress conditions with a predictable shift of p <dig> levels. from eq.  <dig>  the step response of the p53-mdm <dig> feedback can be shown as

  zt=‒pyz·ypz1−e−pzt 

with the assumption that y has a constant value of y. eq.  <dig> suggests that pz but not pyz determines the response time  to reach the half steady-state value) . however, the increase in speed comes at a cost; it decreases the response amplitude as shown in figure 5b. interestingly, increasing both pyz and pz allows the system to achieve a faster response time with constant steady-state amplitude , because the respective increases of pyz and pz offset each other at the steady level . therefore, by modulating both pyz and pz, post-translational suppression can generate more prompt and consistent p <dig> response to stress conditions. indeed, cells respond to dna damage by modulating the post-translational degradation of p <dig> 

validation by a non-linear, mechanistic model
so far, our analyses have been performed using the linear p53-mdm <dig> feedback model  modified from geva-zatorsky et al.  <cit> . even though this model matches experimental measurements  <cit> , it does not capture the non-linear aspects of the negative feedback loop. therefore, the linear model, and hereby its analyses, can only be applied to the first order approximation.

to test whether our findings are still valid when non-linear effects are taken into consideration, we built a mechanistic model of the p53-mdm <dig> feedback :

  dmdm2mrnadt=β1p53nk1n+p53n−α1mdm2mrna 

  dmdm2dt=β2mdm2mrna−α2mdm <dig> 

  dp53mrnadt=β3−α3p53mrna 

  dp53dt=β4p53mrna−α4p53−γp53k2+p53mdm <dig> 

where, , , , and  denote the mrna and protein levels of p <dig> and mdm <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> denotes transcription rates, and β <dig> and β <dig> denote translation rates of mdm <dig> and p <dig>  αs  denote mrna and protein degradation rates. transcriptional activation of mdm <dig> by p <dig> is modeled by a hill function, where n is the hill coefficient and k <dig> is the dissociation constant. mdm2-mediated p <dig> ubiquitination and degradation are modeled by a michaelis-menten  function as described by xu et al.  <cit> . γ is the reaction rate of p <dig> ubiquitination by mdm <dig>  and k <dig> is the saturation constant.

to measure disturbance rejection, p <dig> production was increased by 1% from its steady-state level . steady-state error and %os were then calculated based on the following equations:

  steady−stateerror=ssold−ssnewssold 

  %os=os−ssnewssnew 

where os is the overshoot level, ssold is the p <dig> steady-state level before perturbation, and ssnew is the p <dig> steady-state level after perturbation .

when γ, the degradation rate of p <dig> by mdm2-mediated ubiquitination, increases, the %os initially increases but then decreases, which allows the system to reduce both the steady-state error and %os through gamma . this plot is similar to the previous analysis with the linear model when pz is increased . therefore, the mechanistic model confirmed the insight from the linear model that post-translational suppression enables the p53-mdm <dig> negative feedback to reduce both steady-state error and %os.

we explored the parameter space to examine the different operating regions of the non-linear model, and found that the above tradeoff trend is generally preserved even though the absolute values of steady-state error and %os vary . this is probably due to the fact that the model is roughly piece-wise linear at each operating point when given a modest disturbance, so that higher-order effects do not dominate the first-order behavior predicted by the linear model.

besides non-linearity, the linear model is also overly simplistic in terms of another critical aspect of the p53-mdm2negative feedback, which is time delay. time delay in a negative feedback loop can decrease stability, increase %os and cause sustained oscillation. to examine how time delay affects disturbance rejection, we added explicit delay terms between transcription and translation :

  dmdm2mrnadt=β1p53nk1n+p53n−α1mdm2mrna 

  dmdm2dt=β2mdm2mrnat−τ−α2mdm <dig> 

  dp53mrnadt=β3−α3p53mrna 

  dp53dt=β4p53mrna×t−τ−α4p53−γp53k2+p53mdm <dig> 

where τ denotes the time delay between transcription and translation.

simulations with varying time delay reveal that delay does not affect steady-state error but increases %os, which is consistent with the proposition that time delay decreases stability of negative feedback loops . a longer delay also increases the likelihood of sustained oscillation .

stochastic simulation
so far, the deterministic p53-mdm <dig> models have shown how the negative feedback helps reject external disturbances. however, how does the feedback affect intrinsic, stochastic noise? to understand this issue, we constructed a mechanistic, kinetic model and performed stochastic simulations using the matlab simbiology toolbox  . the mean and standard deviation of the steady-state p <dig> levels are calculated based on stochastic runs . we varied γ, the degradation rate of mdm2-ubiquitinated p <dig>  while keeping the p <dig> level constant, to investigate how the negative feedback affects p <dig> variance . the stochastic noise was then calculated as the variance normalized by the mean . these stochastic simulations reveal that stochastic noise on p <dig> increases when γ increases. this suggests that while mdm2-mediated p <dig> degradation improves disturbance rejection, it pays the price of amplifying stochastic noise. hence, the p53-mdm <dig> negative feedback loop has to balance the trade-off between disturbance rejection and stochastic noise.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our analyses indicate that cells maintain robust p <dig> levels and reject disturbances by simultaneously producing and degrading p <dig>  even though this process is more energy intensive. within the p53-mdm <dig> negative feedback loop, post-translational suppression of p <dig> by mdm <dig> achieves a better trade-off between steady-state and transient errors than transcriptional suppression, which potentially explains why the former has been experimentally observed in the cell. furthermore, post-translational suppression enables p <dig> to respond faster to stress conditions with a more predictable level shift. understanding these nuances allows us to appreciate the complexity of regulatory networks, which will potentially lead to better therapeutics.

besides ubiquitination, p <dig> activity is also heavily regulated by phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling  <cit> . interestingly, these post-translational processes provide similar beneficial tradeoff between steady-state errors and overshoot, while being faster and less energy intensive than protein degradation. it is probably not a coincidence then that p <dig> has multiple phosphorylation sites and is shuttled alongside mdm <dig> between nucleus and cytoplasm. therefore, protein degradation is only one of several post-translational mechanisms that enhance the robustness of the system.

increasing degradation rather than reducing production might be a common strategy evolved by biological systems for robustness. for example, hematopoietic stem cells continuously go through apoptosis  <cit> , which seems energy-inefficient and futile as the protein degradation we discussed. however, our analysis would suggest that regulating apoptosis rather than cell division may enable the stem cell population to become more robust to disturbances and respond faster to changes. the fact that biological systems employ mechanisms for robustness at many different levels raises an interesting question - how does robustness at each level contribute to the overall robustness of the whole system? undoubtedly challenging, attempts to answer this question will help unravel the underlying design principles of complex biological systems.
