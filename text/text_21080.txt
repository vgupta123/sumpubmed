BACKGROUND
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  catalyzes the irreversible β-carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate  to yield oxaloacetate and inorganic phosphate . pepc exists widely in plants, algae, and bacteria, but not in animals or fungi  <cit> . in plants, pepc acts as an allosteric enzyme and is phosphorylated by pepc protein kinase  <cit> . active pepc commonly consists of a plant-type pepc  homotetramer, and is typically inhibited by l-malate and aspartic acid and activated by glucose-6-phosphate . pepc has been extensively studied in c <dig> and cam photosynthesis, because it is a critical enzyme catalyzing the initial reaction of atmospheric co <dig> fixation  <cit> . it also plays pivotal metabolic roles in nonphotosynthetic and c <dig> photosynthetic cells, particularly in the anaplerotic replenishment of the tca cycle intermediates consumed during lipid synthesis  <cit> , biosynthesis, and nitrogen assimilation  <cit> . the genomic analysis of the pepc of arabidopsis and rice first revealed that higher plants contain a small pepc family containing two types of pepc, ptpc and bacterial-type pepc   <cit> . btpc resembles the bacterial pepc rather than the common plant pepc in terms of its gene structure and the absence of an n-terminal seryl-phosphorylation domain, a hallmark of ptpc . recent studies have indicated that btpc in developing castor oil seeds  interacts with ptpc to form a heterooctameric complex with pepc activity  <cit> .

recently, ptpc was reported to be a ubiquitinated protein in arabidopsis  <cit>  and a monoubiquitinated protein in germinated cos  <cit> . ubiquitination is one of the major protein modifications that occur in all eukaryotic cells, and is critical for the regulation of various cellular functions, such as dna damage repair, endocytosis, endosomal sorting, and signal transduction, in addition to proteolysis by the  <dig> s proteasome  <cit> . we previously established a method for the purification and identification of ub-related proteins  in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> . applying this method, we purified and identified ptpc and btpc from the lily anther as candidate ub-related proteins .

as far as we know, no previous study has focused on the pepc expressed in plant reproductive tissues. because atbtpc showed significant expression in stamen  and cos btpc is reported to interact with ptpc  <cit> , we focused here on btpc and ptpc in male reproductive tissues. in this study, we analyzed the expression, localization, and interaction of btpc and ptpc in lily and arabidopsis. our results suggest that btpc forms a complex with ptpc and monoubiquitinated ptpc  to accelerate the accumulation of storage substances during pollen maturation.

RESULTS
btpc and ptpc are identified as ub-related proteins in lily anther, and atbtpc shows stamen-specific expression
with the large-scale purification of ub-related proteins from the lily anther,  <dig> proteins were identified as candidate ub-related proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . the limited number of proteins identified is probably attributable to the small available database of lily proteins. nineteen distinct orthologous arabidopsis genes were determined based on the database . five candidate proteins  have been reported in the arabidopsis pollen proteomes  <cit> . moreover, two orthologous arabidopsis genes  have been reported to be essential for pollen development  <cit> .

to determine the expression patterns of the identified candidate ub-related proteins, the mrna expression of putative arabidopsis orthologues were examined because of the limited genomic information available for the lily. fourteen orthologous genes were selected for rt-pcr analysis in various vegetative tissues, and all of the genes investigated were expressed in flowers. the expression of each gene was examined in the flower organs. all the genes were expressed in the stamen . among them, the transcripts of α-tubulin  <dig>  and atbtpc  showed almost stamen-specific expression. tua <dig> is already known to be expressed specifically in pollen  <cit> . therefore, we focused our attention on btpc. we found that one of the ptpc orthologous genes, atppc <dig> , is also expressed in stamens . ptpc has also been identified as a ub-related protein and they are reported to interact in cos  <cit> , so both types of pepc were investigated in the following analysis.

to verify that btpc and ptpc are ub-related proteins, lily anther proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-ub antibody , which selectively recognizes the ub moiety but not free ub  <cit> . as expected, both bands representing llbtpc and llptpc, of the expected sizes , were co-immunoprecipitated with fk <dig>  indicating that they are the ub-related proteins in the lily anther . another band, larger than the expected size of llptpc, was also detected with the anti-atptpc antibody . the 'larger' anti-atptpc antibody immunoreactive band was approximately  <dig> kda larger than the 'smaller' immunoreactive band and showed similar mobility to the monoubiquitinated ptpc  band in germinated cos  <cit> . the larger bands were also co-immunoprecipitated with fk <dig>  but not with mouse serum , indicating that the larger bands were probably ub-llptpcs.

large-scale purification enabled the identification of truncated sizes of btpc and ptpc , indicating that the in vitro proteolytic cleavage of the two proteins occurred during protein extraction and purification . in contrast, immunoprecipitated ub-related proteins contained the expected sizes of btpc and ptpc . the size discrepancies of purified btpc and ptpc between these two immuno-purification experiments may be due to the different purification periods because in vitro cos btpc proteolysis in an inappropriate buffer was also observed when the incubation period was extended  <cit> . it seemed like that the anti-atbtpc antibody detected two bands , implying the truncation of btpc by proteolysis or post-translational modification , although these possibilities need to be confirmed in future studies.

llbtpc is specifically expressed in pollen after pollen mitosis i  and forms a complex with liptpc
to clarify the tissue specificity of llbtpc and llptpc within the lily anther, the anthers of  <dig> cm flower buds were dissected into the anther wall and pollen, and an immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-atbtpc and anti-atptpc antibodies. as shown in figure 3a, llbtpc specifically existed in the pollen, whereas llptpc was detected in both pollen and the anther wall.

the expression of both pepcs was examined in pollen at various developmental stages. during pollen development, an asymmetric division of the haploid microspores, called pmi, produces two differently fated cells, a larger vc and a smaller generative cell . the gc, which is enclosed within the vc, undergoes a second mitotic division called "pollen mitosis ii" , giving rise to two sperm cells  before fertilization  <cit> . pmii in the lily pollen occurs after pollen germination, so the mature pollen is bicellular at anthesis. the lily pollen developmental stages are distinguishable based on the flower bud length  <cit>  . flower buds of 3- <dig> cm contain microspores, and pmi is completed by the  <dig> cm flower bud stage  <cit> . the gc morphology changes from round to spindle-like shape in the 12- <dig> cm stages  <cit> , and the pollen reaches maturity at anthesis. immunoblot analysis of llbtpc during pollen development demonstrated that llbtpc accumulation starts after pmi, and the amount increases to the  <dig> cm flower bud stage, and is sustained at this level until after anthesis . llptpc and ub-llptpc remained at constant levels during pollen development.

to investigate the interaction between the llbtpc and llptpc proteins and their pepc activity in pollen, the lily pollen proteins were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , followed by in-gel staining for pepc activity and immunoblot analysis . in the microspores at the  <dig> cm flower bud stage, the band showing pepc activity only reacted with the anti-atptpc antibody. in pollen from the  <dig> cm flower buds, two pepc active bands were detected and the smaller band only reacted with the anti-atptpc antibody, whereas the larger band reacted with both the anti-atptpc and anti-atbtpc antibodies. the molecular masses of the smaller and larger bands were approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively. this indicates that llbtpc interacts with llptpc, forming an active pepc complex in late bicellular pollen.

atbtpc promoter is preferentially active in pollen
because the lily is refractory to molecular analysis, the expression patterns of arabidopsis pepc orthologues were analyzed of detail in plant tissues. the arabidopsis pepc gene family contains three ptpc genes  and one btpc gene . transgenic plants were produced in which the β-glucuronidase  reporter gene was placed under the control of the promoter of each atppc gene. to roughly compare the expression levels of these genes, all the transgenic lines were incubated with the substrate for the same time. as expected, the atbtpc gene promoter proatppc <dig> showed significant activity in mature pollen . strong gus staining was detected in the stamens in the late flower bud stage, whereas it was never observed in the younger flower buds . faint activity was observed in the root cortices of the same transgenic lines , but no signal was observed in the leaves , even with longer incubation. transgenic plants expressing green fluorescent protein  under the control of proatppc <dig> showed specific gfp signal in the pollen within the stamens , indicating that atbtpc is expressed specifically in pollen. conversely, weaker gus staining was observed in the mature pollen in all transgenic lines when the gus reporter gene was driven by the atptpc gene promoters . among the atptpcs, proatppc <dig> activity seemed to be strongest in the stamen and pollen in the late flower bud stage . proatppc <dig> activity was negligible in mature pollen , whereas gus staining was observed in the stamens of the younger flower buds . all the atptpc gene promoters were active in all the somatic tissues investigated here, but with different expression patterns .

atbtpc localizes in vegetative cell cytoplasm and shows limited expression during pollen development
to analyze the localization and the expression pattern of atbtpc in the pollen during pollen development, "fluorescent tagging of full-length proteins technology" was applied, because this strategy was available to monitor the expression patterns and subcellular localization of arabidopsis gene products in planta  <cit> . the transgenic plants were produced by introducing the native genomic atppc <dig> gene, including the 5' and 3' untranslated regions , coupled to venus  <cit> , which encodes a variant of yellow fluorescent protein, with low sensitivity to ph . unlike lily pollen, arabidopsis pollen undergoes pmii before pollen germination, so the mature pollen is tricellular at anthesis. the stages of pollen development were distinguishable based on the flower bud length . a notable fluorescent signal was observed in pollen at the  <dig>  mm flower bud stage . 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  staining indicated that pollen at  <dig> fb was tricellular , whereas pollen preceding the  <dig>  mm flower bud stage  was bicellular . confocal laser scanning microscopic  analysis of the pollen at  <dig> fb showed that atbtpc-venus localized in the vc cytoplasm, whereas there was no signal in the vc nuclei or scs .

the levels of atbtpc-venus expression during pollen development were estimated by analyzing the fluorescent signal intensities . whereas no fluorescent signal was observed in the pollen at  <dig> fb , the signal with the most intense fluorescence appeared in the pollen at  <dig> fb . the intensity then decreased sharply in the later developmental stages .

immunoblot analysis of atbtpc-venus using anti-gfp antibody showed that the atbtpc-venus protein accumulated in the pollen at  <dig> - <dig> fb, supporting the results of the clsm analysis . to confirm the mrna expression of endogenous atbtpc in pollen, rt-pcr of full-length atppc <dig> was performed. as expected, the atppc <dig> transcripts accumulated strongly in the pollen at  <dig> - <dig> fb, similar to the atbtpc-venus protein .

discussion
rt-pcr and promoter-gus analyses of arabidopsis pepc genes revealed that atbtpc was also preferentially expressed in stamen , particularly in pollen , similar to lily, whereas atptpcs  were expressed more strongly in somatic tissues. unlike a previous study  <cit> , however, the atppc <dig> expression shown by our rt-pcr analysis was negligible in somatic tissues . this may be due to the reaction conditions or the developmental stages of the investigated tissues, because transgenic plants with proatppc1-gus showed gus staining in confined regions of leaf, root, and flower . the difference in the proatppc3-gus expression pattern from the rt-pcr result reported by sánchez et al.  <cit>  may be due to the same reason as that stated above and/or differences in mrna and protein stability. analysis with a reporter protein fused to each arabidopsis pepc would provide detailed information of atpepc expression.

btpc is significantly expressed in the pollen of both arabidopsis and lily , but the initiation of the expression of each btpc differs during pollen development . libtpc starts to accumulate after gc formation, after pmi, whereas atbtpc expression starts immediately after sc formation, after pmii. based on these findings, it seems that the initiation of btpc expression in pollen does not depend on the mitosis type, but is triggered after the 'last mitosis' during pollen development, before germination. in both bicellular and tricellular pollen, the expansion of the pollen grain, organelle differentiation, and dehydration occur after the last mitosis for pollen maturation  <cit> . however, pollen dehydration does not seem to affect atppc <dig> expression, because atppc <dig> expression started after pmii, but was not sustained until anthesis , although it has been reported that atppc <dig> expression is inducible by drought stress in root tissues  <cit> .

we examined the atbtpc-null mutant line, atppc <dig> , but no abnormal characteristics were observed in the mutant pollen when analyzed by dapi staining and ultrastructural observation, or in plant growth or fertility . therefore, plant btpc may not be an essential factor for pollen development or plant survival, at least under our experimental growth conditions. nevertheless, the expression of btpc is significant in the pollen, suggesting that btpc plays an important role in pollen development.

it is well known that pepc is a ptpc homotetramer. in a previous study with cos, the presence of low- and high-molecular-mass pepc isoforms was reported, which were designated class- <dig>  and class- <dig> pepcs , respectively  <cit> . after nondenaturing page in our study, the small active pepc band only reacted with anti-atptpc antibody, whereas the large active pepc band reacted with both anti-atptpc and anti-atbtpc antibodies , showing the same immunoreactivities as cos class- <dig> and class- <dig> pepcs, respectively  <cit> . the small and large active pepc bands in lily showed similar sizes to those of the cos class- <dig> and class- <dig> pepcs, respectively. therefore, the lily pepcs in the microspores and the late bicellular pollen exist as complexes, and the small and large pepc complexes probably corresponded to the cos class- <dig> and class- <dig> pepcs, respectively. it has also been reported that ptpc is monoubiquitinated in cos, resulting in a class- <dig> pepc heterotetramer comprised of ub-ptpc:ptpc  <cit> . in this work, fk <dig> immunoprecipitated ub-llptpc from the lily anther containing late bicellular pollen in addition to the native forms of llbtpc and llptpc , suggesting that the native forms of libtpc and llptpc are the associated proteins of ubiquitinated-llptpc resulting in the identification by large-scale purification of ub-related proteins from lily anther . in addition, ub-llptpc was present together with llptpc in the pollen throughout its development from microspore to mature pollen . from these results, we infer that the class- <dig> pepc complex in the microspore comprises ub-llptpc:llptpc and the class- <dig> pepc complex in the late bicellular pollen comprises llbtpc:ub-llptpc:llptpc.

pepc is allosterically activated by glc-6-p and inhibited by l-malate and aspartic acid metabolized from oxaloacetate . recently, it was reported that class- <dig> pepcs show much lower sensitivity to allosteric activators and inhibitors than do class- <dig> pepc homotetramers, suggesting that the interaction of ptpc and btpc stabilize the metabolic flow under physiological conditions that would otherwise inhibit class- <dig> pepc  <cit> . it has also been reported that class- <dig> pepc heterotetramers of ub-ptpc:ptpc are more sensitive to both activators and inhibitors than are class- <dig> pepc homotetramer of ptpc in cos  <cit> . these reported features and our results together suggest that expressed btpc binds to the ub-ptpc:ptpc complex, and that the resulting btpc:ub-ptpc:ptpc complex is even less sensitive to inhibitors, but maintains its higher sensitivity to activators relative to the sensitivity of class- <dig> pepc homotetramers. consequently, it is speculated that the btpc:ub-ptpc:ptpc complex may stabilize and accelerate the metabolic flow required for lipid and protein synthesis in pollen . the increase in pepc activity in developing cos endosperm was coincident with the onset of the most active phase of storage oil accumulation  <cit> . it has also been reported that the protein content of transgenic bean plants expressing a corynebacterium glutamicum pepc was elevated in their seeds by up to 50%  <cit> . in lily pollen, there is a marked increase in lipid bodies in the vc cytoplasm of the mature pollen compared with those in the pollen before pmi  <cit> . in arabidopsis tricellular pollen, storage vacuoles accumulate after pmii and disappear from the mature pollen just before anthesis and at anthesis  <cit> . the patterns of the appearance of storage organelles in lily and arabidopsis pollen almost coincide with the patterns of llbtpc and atbtpc expression, respectively, supporting our hypothesis that btpc plays a role in the acceleration of metabolic flow to facilitate the synthesis of storage substances during late pollen development. previous studies of class- <dig> pepcs have suggested that green alga and vascular plants have divergent pepcs that serve to function in adaptation for survival in different environments  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine what triggers and suppresses the expression of btpc during pollen development. further investigation of class- <dig> and class- <dig> pepcs is expected to provide more information of the metabolic pathway underlying the synthesis of storage substances in both bicellular and tricellular pollens during development.

CONCLUSIONS
the large-scale purification of ub-related proteins from the lily anther should advance research into the reproductive factors related to ub-mediated protein modifications. in this study, btpc was first found as a ub-related protein in pollen.

llbtpc and atbtpc show significant expression in pollen and they are first expressed after the last mitosis before pollen germination. the duration of their expression almost coincides with the appearance of storage organelles during the maturation processes of both pollens. the presence of btpc:ub-ptpc:ptpc with pepc activity during pollen maturation is also suggested in this study. it would be necessary to confirm the presence of the ub-ptpc:ptpc and btpc:ub-ptpc:ptpc complexes with their kinetic properties in pollen in future studies. furthermore, future tasks include clarification of the atptpc proteins  involved in class- <dig> and class- <dig> pepc formation during pollen development because atptpcs show different expression patterns , and investigation of their post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation. the results are expected to shed light on the role of pepcs in pollen development.

btpc is strongly expressed in the late stage of pollen development, but an atbtpc-deficient mutant plant, atppc <dig>  showed no abnormalities in pollen development, at least under our experimental growth conditions. pepc itself is involved in the anaplerotic replenishment of intermediates of the tca cycle, and for this reason, any obvious effects of btpc deficiency may be difficult to identify. alternatively, analysis under various physiological and growth conditions, such as varying temperatures, may identify the physiological function of btpc in the reproductive process, because the thermal stability of class- <dig> pepc activity is relatively increased  <cit> . this is the first characterization of btpc in pollen, the male gametophyte of higher plants. our work provides new information for the study of the function of btpc in plants.
