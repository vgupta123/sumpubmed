BACKGROUND
as the main role of microsomal cyp2e <dig> is detoxification of xenobiotics  the highest level of its constitutive expression is found in liver and kidneys, organs that mostly utilize and excrete harmful substances off the organism
 <cit> . there are  <dig> hydrophobic substances of exogenous origin known as substrates for cyp2e <dig> . most of them are environmental pollutants , components of food additives, drugs and cosmetics. cyp2e <dig> on one hand contributes in withdrawal of xenobiotics by metabolizing them in liver . on the other hand cyp2e <dig>  while metabolizing, may activate its substrates into cytotoxins, which causes different cell damages. substrates of cyp2e <dig> induce its protein expression level but the mechanisms of such induction steel need to be investigated. such increase in cyp2e <dig> protein level causes homeostasis misbalance in cell. thus it is shown that introduction of ethanol  into the animals causes intensification of peroxidation processes and depletion of hepatocyte antioxidant system
 <cit> . activation of peroxidation processes may be caused by the ethanol-dependent induction of cyp2e <dig>  which can generate oxygen radicals during its catalytic cycle. as a result an oxidation stress usually develops in cell
 <cit> . herewith ethanol does not only stimulate cyp2e1-dependent peroxidation, but serves as a source of free radicals itself . posttranslational stabilization of protein molecule with substrates is one of the main mechanisms of regulation of cyp2e <dig> expression level in cell. it is believed that substrates while in the active site of enzyme, change and stabilize protein structure, thus preventing its fast degradation with proteasomes
 <cit> . the mechanisms of such substrates-dependent cyp2e <dig> protein stabilization mostly are staying uninvestigated. the processes of transfer of microsomal cyp2e <dig> to the proteasome  also need to be investigated. it is thought that cytoplasm heat shock proteins, in particular hsp <dig>  actively participate in these processes
 <cit> . this work is devoted to investigating the role of hsp <dig> in the degradation of microsomal cyp2e <dig> and studying the influence of ethanol on these processes.

RESULTS
it is known that the level of cyp2e <dig> expression in cell is regulated at all stages of protein biosynthesis from the initiation of transcription to the posttranslational stabilization of this enzyme
 <cit> . posttranslational substrate-dependent stabilization is one of the main mechanisms that regulates the intracellular content of cyp2e1
 <cit> . it is shown that the stabilization of cyp2e <dig> by the ethanol molecule increases its half-life period from  <dig> to  <dig> hours
 <cit> . it is known that in the absence of substrate and with the participation of the enzymes of proteasome system the so-called rapid degradation of cyp2e <dig> is taking place. the in vitro experiments with heterologous recombinant proteins revealed that a cytoplasmic heat shock proteins could play a decisive role in the mechanisms of such degradation
 <cit> . in particular, it was shown that specific inhibition of hsp <dig> resulted in the accumulation of microsomal cyp2e <dig> in cell
 <cit> . however, hsp90-dependent processes of cyp2e <dig> degradation are poorly investigated today. it is also unclear how cyp2e <dig> is being transferred from membrane to the cytoplasm and becomes accessible to the proteasome degradation system. in order to investigate the hsp90-dependent processes in the cyp2e <dig> degradation mechanisms we have evaluated the possibility of direct spatial interactions of proteins by using computer simulation methods. during the protein-protein docking of cyp2e <dig> with hsp <dig> the cyp2e1-hsp <dig> complex was obtained. this complex  is characterized in the table
 <dig>  due to this model, it was revealed that hsp <dig> binds to membrane-associated domain of cyp2e <dig> . besides, two main structural and functional features of this complex could be distinguished from tables
 <dig> and
 <dig>  first of all, the entrance to the cyp2e <dig> active centre channel is being covered by hsp <dig> molecule, which reduces the probability of cyp2e <dig> interaction with substrates. this prevents protein structure stabilization by substrates and results in enzyme rapid degradation. secondly, some hydrophobic region of cyp2e <dig>  is also being screened by hsp <dig> molecule while forming cyp2e1-hsp <dig> complex. this promotes the microsomal cyp2e <dig> dissociation from the membrane and helps to shuttle it into the cytoplasm to the proteasome for proteolysis. the obtained results that allowed us to evaluate the studied proteins as partners confirmed data obtained by other authors during in vitro experiments with heterologous recombinant proteins
 <cit> . it is known that substrate-dependent stabilization of the cyp2e <dig> molecule significantly inhibits its degradation
 <cit> . it was shown that ethanol can structurally stabilize the cyp2e <dig> molecule and suppress proteolysis by the ethanol-dependent inhibition of the proteolytic system
 <cit> . however, the mechanism of such an inhibition has not been fully understood yet. during our work the features of cyp2e <dig> and hsp <dig> expression under the chronic action of ethanol were studied. wb method revealed a twofold increase in cyp2e <dig> level in the liver of experimental mice, which consumed 10% ethanol in drinking water for  <dig> days . previously, no significant changes were shown in cyp2e <dig> mrna level relative to the control under similar experimental conditions
 <cit> . the obtained data indicates that the increase in cyp2e <dig> protein level is caused by the stabilization of the enzyme molecule but not by the transcription process intensification. it is known that such substrate-dependent induction of cyp2e <dig> increases peroxidation processes and leads to the antioxidant system depletion and development of oxidative stress in the cell. this state is accompanied by intracellular structural and functional damages of macromolecules , thus in turn causing an intensification of the stress genes expression, in particular genes that encode proteins of the hsp family. the doubling of hsp <dig> content in the liver of experimental animals was found using wb method . such increase in intracellular stress proteins level is one of the main adaptive responses to oxidative stress and is aimed to restore the cell homeostasis
 <cit> . the increase in the level of expression of the hsp <dig> should lead to the intensification of cyp2e <dig> proteolysis and reducing of its content in the cell. however, such effect was not observed in our experimental conditions. therefore, we suggested that under the chronic effect of ethanol the interaction of the chaperone hsp <dig> with cyp2e <dig> is being inhibited thus blocking its hsp90-mediated transfer to the proteasome for subsequent degradation. in order to test this hypothesis we studied the effect of ethanol on the interactions of cyp2e <dig> with hsp <dig>  for this purpose, a complex of cyp2e <dig> with ethanol  was designed and optimized using computer simulation methods. we have shown that ethanol molecule causes some decrease in volume and surface area of the cyp2e <dig> . this may indicate the spatial stabilization of cyp2e <dig> molecule. some changes in charges on protein surface and a significant decrease in the enzyme polar surface under the influence of ethanol were also shown . the appearance of large positively charged region in the area of entrance to the active site and changes in the cyp2e <dig> protein surface charge and polar surface area can affect its ability to interact with other ligands and/or protein partners, hsp <dig> in particular. to study the effect of ethanol on the cyp2e <dig> interaction with hsp <dig>  we performed a protein-protein docking of cyp2e1-ethanol with hsp <dig>  the structure of cyp2e1-ethanol-hsp <dig> complex is presented at figure
1b. the obtained data showed significant change in preferred hsp <dig> binding site of cyp2e <dig> . such difference in favourable binding sites may be explained by the changes in charged regions on protein surface in presence of ethanol. the obtained data shows that some structural adjustments in spatial structure of cyp2e <dig> under the influence of ethanol reduce the efficiency of its interaction with hsp <dig>  such ethanol-dependent inhibition of the cyp2e1-hsp <dig> complex formation leads to further inhibition of both the enzyme dissociation from the membrane and its subsequent degradation in the proteasome. this may explain the revealed elevation of cyp2e <dig> level in conjunction with a high level of hsp <dig> expression in the liver of animals chronically treated with ethanol. based on these results we can assume that the cytoplasmic hsp <dig> and microsomal cyp2e <dig>  as partner proteins, can directly interact with each other leading to the dissociation of the cyp2e <dig> from the membrane and its further transfer to the proteasome for proteolysis. the ethanol-dependent inhibition of the interaction between hsp <dig> and cyp2e <dig> suppresses its proteasome degradation, thus leading to its accumulation in the cell. the obtained data let us suggest that this is one of the mechanisms of substrate-dependent regulation of the cyp2e <dig> level in the cell.

CONCLUSIONS
cytoplasmic chaperone hsp <dig> and membrane-bound cyp2e <dig>  as partner proteins may directly interact with each other, leading to the dissociation of the cyp2e <dig> from the membrane. this makes it possible to transfer microsomal cyp2e <dig> to the proteasome for proteolysis. the ethanol molecule inhibits the interaction of hsp <dig> with cyp2e <dig> leading to the increased content of this protein in the cell. we assume that other substrates of cyp2e <dig> should increase its content in the same way. this may be one of the mechanisms of substrate-dependent regulation of the cyp2e <dig> level in the cell.
