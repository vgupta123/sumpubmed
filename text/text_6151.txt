BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic colonizer of the nasopharynx and the causative agent of many serious diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis and otitis media. initially, strains of s. pneumoniae were exquisitely susceptible to penicillin, and β-lactam antibiotics were the recommended empirical treatment against pneumococcal diseases. however, pneumococci resistant to β-lactams and other classes of antibiotics now represent a major burden due to the spread of multidrug resistant clones  and penicillin-resistant pneumococci are listed among the most serious antibiotic resistance threats  <cit> . antimicrobial resistance will require innovation not only in the development of new antibiotics but also in alternative treatment strategies and, in this context, biological therapeutics were included among the seven key areas of antimicrobial resistance for which research is urgently needed  <cit> .

bacteriophage  therapy represents one of the promising alternatives against multidrug resistant pathogens. strategies include the use of isolated virions but also some of their products like endolysins, a family of peptidoglycan hydrolases released at the terminal stage of phages replication cycle for the lysis of infected cells and phage progeny release. in the case of s. pneumoniae, a number of studies have demonstrated the potential of phage-produced endolysins against otitis media  <cit> , bacteremia  <cit>  and pneumonia  <cit> . in contrast, while pneumophages have been repeatedly described in the literature , studies evaluating the use of whole virions have lagged behind. a high proportion of s. pneumoniae clinical isolates are lysogens  and the vast majority of pneumophages currently identified are temperate phages. however, because temperate phages have the ability to transfer host dna and/or increase virulence  <cit> , virulent phages are thought to be better suited for biocontrol purposes.

very few virulent bacteriophages infecting s. pneumoniae have been isolated. despite the isolation of omega phages several decades ago  <cit> , the pneumophages dp- <dig> and cp- <dig> are the only lytic phages that remain available in curated bacteriophage collections. phage dp- <dig> was the first virulent pneumophage to be isolated  <cit> . it belongs to the siphoviridae family and has a dna genome of  <dig>  bp coding for  <dig> putative proteins,  <dig> of which could be annotated based on sequence homology  <cit> . phage cp- <dig> was isolated in  <dig>  <cit>  and is a member of the podoviridae family. its dna genome of  <dig>  bp contains  <dig> open reading frames > <dig> nucleotides of which a third could be assigned a function based on sequence homology at the protein level with gene products from bacteriophage phi <dig> infecting bacillus subtilis  <cit> . the infectivity of dp- <dig> and cp- <dig> was shown to require choline in the pneumococcus cell wall  <cit> . more recently, a natural variant of cp- <dig> called socp with a genome of  <dig>  bp and  <dig> single nucleotide variations has been described  <cit> . the annotation of the genome of socp revealed  <dig> open reading frames, each preceded by a putative ribosome-binding site, and a putative function could be assigned to  <dig> proteins  <cit> .

one of the perceived drawbacks of phage therapy is the likely emergence of phage-resistant derivatives or clones  <cit> . such phage resistance phenotype may be due to dedicated defense mechanisms harboured by some strains, including restriction-modification systems and crispr-cas systems or may be due to the absence of specific host factors such as phage receptors or to the presence of interfering capsular polysaccharides  <cit> . in addition to phage adsorption at the cell surface, many other steps of the phages lytic cycle such as replication, transcription and translation also likely depend on bacterial cytoplasmic gene products. the absence or inactivation of some of these genes could prevent the lysis of phage-infected cells. therefore, an in-depth understanding of the bacterial factors involved in phage-host interactions is needed to optimize the selection of appropriate therapeutic phage.

here, we identified host factors involved in the pneumophage infection process. we first confirmed, using molecular tools, the role of the capsule in protecting pneumophage infection. we also infected the unencapsulated s. pneumoniae r <dig> with virulent phage dp- <dig> and socp and selected spontaneous bacteriophage-insensitive mutants. genome sequencing of the mutants and functional analysis revealed diverse mutations implicated in resistance to pneumophages.

RESULTS
interaction of bacteriophages socp and dp- <dig> with s. pneumoniae
the unencapsulated strain s. pneumoniae r <dig> is highly sensitive to pneumophages socp and dp- <dig> . this is in sharp contrast to its encapsulated s. pneumoniae d <dig> ancestor which demonstrates complete resistance . the pneumococcal capsule had previously been shown to inhibit infection by omega pneumophages  <cit>  and it is possible that a similar protective role also occur against bacteriophages socp and dp- <dig>  the role of the pneumococcal capsule in the resistance to phages socp and dp- <dig> was assessed by generating a s. pneumoniae d <dig> derivative inactivated for the gene cps2c . the inactivation of cps2c was previously shown to result in a severe reduction in capsule size  <cit> . capsular serotyping with an antisera directed against type  <dig> pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides confirmed the absence of detectable capsule in s. pneumoniae d39Δcps2c . s. pneumoniae d39Δcps2c also had the same level of sensitivity to socp and dp- <dig> as s. pneumoniae r <dig> . reverting cps2c to a wt version in d39Δcps2c restored the capsule and abrogated phage sensitivity in the resulting s. pneumoniae d39cps2c-rpsl transformant . the pneumococcal serotype  <dig> capsule is thus a major determinant of resistance against virulent pneumophages.table  <dig> sensitivity of s. pneumoniae strains to bacteriophages socp and dp-1

to further our understanding of interactions between pneumophages and s. pneumoniae r <dig>  we selected bacteriophage-insensitive mutants . one mutant resistant to phage socp and another resistant to phage dp- <dig> were chosen for further characterization and these were named s. pneumoniae r6-socpr and r6-dp1r, respectively . the bacteriophage-insensitive mutants r6-socpr and r6-dp1r mutants had unaltered growth kinetics compared to s. pneumoniae r <dig> wild-type  . both mutants also displayed a normal morphology under electronic microscopy and had unaltered cell wall thickness compared to their s. pneumoniae r <dig> parent . the r6-socpr and r6-dp1r mutants were highly resistant to the phage used for their selection. there were no detectable plaques when a socp bacteriophage suspension  was spotted onto a lawn of r6-socpr . in contrast, spotted socp bacteriophages onto a lawn of s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt resulted in a confluent zone of clearing . similarly, the efficiency of plaquing  of dp- <dig> on r6-dp1r was determined to 10− <dig> when compared to the indicator strain s. pneumoniae r <dig> . the mutants r6-socpr and r6-dp1r remained sensitive to dp- <dig> and socp, respectively .

adsorption and replication of pneumophages socp and dp-1
to gain further insights into the step of the infective cycle that is blocked in the resistant mutants, we first tested whether bacteriophage adsorption was prevented in r6-socpr and r6-dp1r. adsorption assays showed that pneumophages socp and dp- <dig> efficiently adsorbed to s. pneumoniae r <dig> but that adsorption of socp was reduced on mutant r6-socpr . socp adsorption levels on r6-socpr still remain substantially high however , suggesting additional mechanisms for resistance . in contrast, the s. pneumoniae r6-dp1r mutant adsorbed dp- <dig> bacteriophages as efficiently as s. pneumoniae r <dig> . the resistance of both mutants thus likely affect a step of the lytic cycle beyond the phage adsorption process.fig.  <dig> adsorption of phages socp and dp- <dig> on s. pneumoniae strains. rates of adsorption of socp and dp- <dig> on s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt , r6-socpr  or r6-dp1r . no adsorption occurred in the absence of bacteria . adsorption of socp on r6-dp1r and adsorption of dp- <dig> on r6-socpr was not measured since no bacteriophage cross-resistance occurred in the mutants . ***denotes significant differences in adsorption compared to the mock control . ###denotes significant differences in adsorption compared to r <dig> wt 



we next assayed whether the intracellular replication of pneumophages is impaired in s. pneumoniae r6-socpr and r6-dp1r. total dna  was extracted at successive time points following infection of s. pneumoniae r6-socpr and r6-dp1r with phages socp and dp- <dig>  respectively. the dna samples were then digested with sspi before being electrophoresed and transferred on nylon membrane. hybridizing membranes with probes covering the holin gene from socp or dp- <dig> allowed monitoring the kinetics of phage genome replication by measuring the intensity of phage dna over time after infection. in s. pneumoniae r <dig>  replication of socp was already well advanced at  <dig> min following infection and socp dna levels had increased by an estimated 20-fold after  <dig> min . in contrast, no holin-derived signals could be detected following infection of r6-socpr even at the  <dig> min time point . this suggests that resistance in s. pneumoniae r6-socpr occurs at very early stages of the infection cycle. in our experimental conditions, the replication of pneumophage dp- <dig> within s. pneumoniae r <dig> began after a latency of about  <dig> to  <dig> min  <cit> , and after  <dig> min dp- <dig> dna levels had increased by an estimated 22-fold . an increase in dp- <dig> holin signals was also observed upon infection of s. pneumoniae r6-dp1r but at a 4-fold decreased rate compared to s. pneumoniae r <dig> . this suggests that dp- <dig> replication occurred but was severely impaired in the r6-dp1r mutant.fig.  <dig> kinetics of socp dna replication. s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt , r6-socpr  and s. pneumoniae r <dig> transformed with r6-socpr-derived alleles for genes spr <dig> , spr <dig>  or spr <dig>  were infected with the lytic phage socp at a moi of  <dig> . total dna was extracted at baseline and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min after infection. total dna was digested with sspi before being hybridized with an dctp-labeled probe covering the holin gene of socp . dna loading was controlled by hybridizing the blots with an dctp-labeled probe covering the spr <dig> gene from s. pneumoniae r <dig> . holin/spr <dig> signal ratios are indicated in italics below the blots. hybridizations were done in triplicates and representative blots are shown. f plot of holin/spr <dig> signal ratios for s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt , r6-socpr , r6spr <dig> , r6spr <dig> , and r6spr <dig> . for each strain, the ratios at each time point  were significantly different  than those of r <dig> wt

whole genome sequencing of s. pneumoniae r6-socpr and r6-dp1r
whole genome sequencing is useful for identifying genes involved in host-phage interactions  and the genomes of s. pneumoniae r6-socpr and r6-dp1r  were sequenced to identify mutations putatively implicated in resistance. whole-genome sequencing revealed a total of eleven and five nucleotide mutations in the genomes of r6-socpr and r6-dp1r, respectively . none of the mutations  was common to both mutants  which is consistent with the absence of cross-resistance . every mutation detected in r6-socpr occurred within coding sequences  while two of those found in r6-dp1r were non-coding . for both mutants, mutations in open reading frames invariably led to amino acid substitutions .table  <dig> list of all mutations identified in the genome of r6-socpr and r6-dp1r

the role of each mutation in pneumophage resistance was assessed by resistance construction, a strategy shown useful for pinpointing mutations implicated in antibiotic resistance in s. pneumoniae . this was done by transforming s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt with separate pcr products covering variant alleles derived from r6-socpr or r6-dp1r along with a pcr fragment covering the rpsl allele of s. pneumoniae cp <dig>  <cit>  and conferring resistance to streptomycin. the latter was used as a surrogate marker for the selection of transformants. the rpsl allele had no impact on pneumophage susceptibility levels when transformed alone . the streptomycin-resistant transformants were then screened for the presence of mutated alleles. using a similar approach, the mutated genes were reverted back to their wt versions in the r6-socpr or r6-dp1r mutants for phenotype confirmation. finally, each reconstructed strain was tested for resistance to socp or dp- <dig> table  <dig> the role of mutations detected in r6-socpr in resistance to phage socp

mutations involved in resistance to socp
a role in resistance to phage socp was confirmed for three of the eleven mutations  detected in the s. pneumoniae r6-socpr mutant . the gene spr <dig> codes for a gntr-type transcription factor and the introduction of the spr <dig> allele from r6-socpr into s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt decreased the eop of socp by three orders of magnitude . transforming s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt with pcr fragments covering the genes spr <dig>  or spr <dig>  amplified from s. pneumoniae r6-socpr similarly decreased the eop of socp by three logs . in all cases, reverting any of the three mutations in s. pneumoniae r6-socpr to a wt allele conferred coherent sensitivity levels to phage socp for the transformants r6-socpr_spr0058wt, r6-socpr_spr0897wt and r6-socpr_spr1443wt . moreover, introducing the spr <dig>  spr <dig> and spr <dig> mutations altogether in s. pneumoniae r <dig> produced transformants as resistant to socp as the original r6-socpr mutant , although the combination of any two mutations appears sufficient to confer high-level resistance . interestingly, introducing the spr <dig>  spr <dig> or spr <dig> mutations in s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt also impaired the dna replication of socp , especially in the case of spr <dig> .

when additional s. pneumoniae r <dig> mutants made resistant to socp were tested for the presence of mutations in spr <dig>  spr <dig> and spr <dig>  three  additional mutants had a mutation in at least one of the genes . none of the mutants had the exact same genotype for the three genes tested which preclude multiple sampling of the same end-point clone from the original culture  . instead, it highlights the major role of genes on the infective cycle of socp. for spr <dig> and spr <dig> the mutations even targeted the same amino acid as in the r6-socpr mutant, leading to a different substitution in the case of spr <dig> . s. pneumoniae r6-socp-5r was the only additional mutant with a mutation in gene spr <dig>  harbouring a non-sense mutation at codon  <dig> . the e154k mutation originally detected in spr <dig> in r6-socpr  is also expected to considerably alter the activity of the protein given that s. pneumoniae r6spr <dig> harbouring the spr <dig> e154k mutation from r6-socpr displayed the same level of resistance to socp than s. pneumoniae r6Δspr <dig> in which we inactivated spr <dig> by insertion-duplication mutagenesis . the gene product of spr <dig> has similarity with regulators of the metabolite-responsive gntr family, which often regulate the expression of genes nearby of their location on the chromosome  <cit> . comparative gene expression profiling by rna-seq between s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt and s. pneumoniae r6Δspr <dig>  indeed revealed that an adjacent operon on the chromosome  coding for sugar transporters and metabolizing enzymes is overexpressed upon inactivation of spr <dig> . additional putative operons also had their expression altered in s. pneumoniae r6Δspr <dig>  including several carbohydrate transport systems, which are also likely part of the spr <dig> regulon .table  <dig> targeted screening for mutations in additional bacteriophage insensitive mutants

mutations involved in resistance to dp-1
whole genome sequencing of s. pneumoniae r6-dp1r revealed a total of five mutations, three of which occurred within open reading frames . resistance reconstruction further confirmed two nucleotide mutations targeting the same codon and leading to a single amino acid substitution in the mcrb subunit of the mcrbc restriction endonuclease   were solely responsible for the high-level resistance of r6-dp1r . indeed, pneumophage dp- <dig> had the same eop on r6-dp1r than on s. pneumoniae r6spr <dig>  a s. pneumoniae r <dig> wt derivative into which a spr <dig> pcr fragment amplified from r6-dp1r was introduced . conversely, reverting spr <dig> to a wt version in r6-dp1r completely abrogated its resistance against pneumophage dp- <dig> , confirming the role of the mutation in the phage resistance phenotype. testing for additional s. pneumoniae r <dig> mutants made resistant to dp- <dig> again revealed that three out of the four additional mutants had the same mutation as r6-dp1r , although this time we cannot exclude that the same clone had been selected multiple times from the original culture.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
bacteria have evolved diverse antiviral strategies to survive in phage-containing environments. these include adsorption resistance, which results in reduced interactions between the phage and its bacterium host; restriction-modification mechanisms and crispr-cas systems, where bacteria survive and phage genomes are cleaved; and abortive infections, where bacteria die and phages usually remain trapped inside . also, many steps of the phage replication cycle likely depend on bacterial gene products, which if mutated may lead to phage resistance. additional phage defence systems include superinfection exclusion whereby immunity occurs through the expression of a protein blocking the entry of dna for specific phages. the genes encoding these proteins are often found in prophages, suggesting that in many cases these systems are important for phage–phage interactions rather than phage–host interactions .

the genomic characterization of a s. pneumoniae r <dig> mutant insensitive to phage socp revealed mutations in genes spr <dig>  spr <dig> and spr <dig> that seemingly work additively to increase resistance. the gene spr <dig> is coding for a transcriptional regulator of the gntr family and suffered from a g460a mutation leading to an e154k substitution in s. pneumoniae r6-socpr . gntr regulators are one of the most abundant and widely distributed groups of helix-turn-helix transcription factors  <cit> . they contain a dna-binding domain at their n-terminus as well as an effector-binding and oligomerisation domain at the c-terminus of the protein in which the e154k mutation is located. the effector-binding domain is believed to modulate activity of bacterial transcription factors in response to binding small molecules  <cit> . the inactivation of spr <dig> in r6Δspr <dig> conferred the same socp resistance phenotype as the e154k mutation alone  and it is tempting to speculate that the activity of the gntr regulator is also greatly impaired in the r6-socpr mutant. inactivation of gntr regulators through the acquisition of mutations was similarly shown to occur during adaption of comamonas testosteroni to utilize phenol as the major carbon source, whereby several different missense mutations inactivated the repressor activity of the gntr regulator aphs  <cit> . gntr regulators bind dna as dimers through interaction between their c-terminal domain  <cit>  and one possibility is that the spr <dig> mutation in r6-socpr prevents repression by impairing with dimerization of the regulator at the operator-binding site. another possibility would be that the mutation locks the repressor in a conformation mimicking the presence of bond ligand, thereby alleviating repression.

gntr family regulators often regulate  the expression of neighbor genes  <cit>  and the increased expression in r6Δspr <dig> of adjacent genes spr0059- <dig> coding for sugar transporters and metabolizing enzymes is consistent with this assumption. bacterial operons coding for carbohydrate transporters constitute functional units and, in addition to the transporter, they are usually coding for glycosyl-hydrolases for the production of mono- or disaccharides and/or enzymes for the metabolic steps linking specific sugars to glycolysis  <cit> . in the case of the spr0059- <dig> operon overexpressed in r6Δspr <dig> , the beta-galactosidase encoded by spr <dig> was characterized as a surface enzyme responsible for cleavage of galβ1-3glcnac  <cit>  and it was proposed that the operon may thus code for a galactose uptake system  <cit> . increased content of galactose in cell wall polymers have been correlated with increased bacteriophage resistance in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris  <cit>  and rhizobium meliloti  <cit> . in the case of phage-resistant l. lactis subsp. cremoris, an increase in galactosyl-containing lipoteichoic acid in the cell wall was further linked to a reduced bacteriophage adsorption  <cit> . teichoic acid is also involved in pneumophage adsorption  <cit>  and a similar phenomenon could possibly explain the reduced adsorption of socp on s. pneumoniae r6-socpr. the expression of many other genes  was altered in r6Δspr <dig> besides spr0059- <dig> however , and pinpointing the gene actually implicated in resistance to socp will required further investigation.

the gene spr <dig> mutated in r6-socpr  codes for a plasma membrane glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase , an enzyme of the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway involved in the production of glycerol-3-phosphate along with choline or ethanolamine from glycerophosphocholine or glycerophosphoethanolamine, respectively  <cit> . the p162t substitution in r6-socpr is located at a conserved position within the second extracellular loop based on tmhmm transmembrane domains prediction. most studies on glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterases have focused on the catalytic domain which is located away from the p162t mutation at the c-terminus of the protein and the role of the mutation on the activity of the protein remains to be further explored. given the role of these enzymes in the production of choline  <cit>  and the dependency of pneumophage adsorption on choline-containing teichoic acid in the bacterial cell wall  <cit> , it is possible that the mutation either interferes with the function of the protein or that it is favoring glycerophosphoethanolamine over glycerophosphocholine as its preferred substrate. in both cases this would translate into a decreased choline content  in the cell wall, possibly explaining the decreased adsorption of socp on r6-socpr . however, glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterases have been shown to influence gene expression  <cit>  and an indirect role for the mutation in resistance by altering gene expression in r6-socpr cannot be ruled out.

the last mutation implicated in resistance against bacteriophage socp in r6-socpr occurred in gene spr <dig>  coding for a mur ligase homolog named murt . murt, along with the product of gene spr <dig> , was recently shown to be responsible for the amidation of the glutamate residue in position  <dig> of the stem peptide of lipid ii, a peptidoglycan precursor . amidation of lipid ii is required for efficient peptidoglycan cross-linking in some gram positive bacteria, including s. pneumoniae, and non-amidated glutamate-containing peptides were indeed found to be scarce in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . cell wall cross-linking is important for optimal growth and influences susceptibility to antibiotics and murein hydrolases  <cit> . the murt v408a substitution detected in r6-socpr is located at the c-terminus of the protein in a domain named duf <dig>  this domain of unknown function is associated with the c-terminus of bacterial mur ligases . the role of the v408a substitution on the activity of murt/gatd remains to be established but is unlikely to inactivate the activity of this amido transferase system which was shown to be essential in s. aureus  <cit>  and s. pneumoniae r <dig>  <cit> .

resistance to bacteriophage dp- <dig> involved a single mutation in the gene spr <dig> coding for the mcrb subunit of a type iv mcrbc restriction endonuclease . type iv restriction endonucleases recognize modified, typically methylated, dna. the mcrbc endonucleases recognize and cleave dna containing two hemi or fully methylated rmc sites in an optimal distance of about  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs  <cit> . the nuclease active site of the mcrbc restriction endonuclease resides in its mcrc subunit  <cit>  while mcrb is responsible for dna binding and gtp hydrolysis  <cit> . the c330a mutation in r6-dp1r is not in the mcrb domain responsible for recognition of methylated dna which was shown to reside in the first  <dig> residues of the protein  <cit> . the mutation is instead located in the gtpase domain located at the c-terminus of mcrb, in a region conserved between several mcrb sequences  <cit> . interestingly, targeted mutagenesis of conserved polar amino acids to an alanine residue within the conserved region in escherichia coli translated into an array of phenotypes going from complete inactivation to impaired gtp or dna binding and even enhanced gtpase activity  <cit> . the equivalent residue to c <dig> in r6-dp1r was not part of the sites targeted by the mutagenesis however and it is not possible to infer about a possible phenotype at the moment. still, the dp- <dig> genome is resistant to several type ii restriction enzymes, suggesting the presence of modified bases, and it will be interesting to further study the impact of the mutated version of mcrbc on dp- <dig> dna.

finally, every lytic pneumophage studied to date  are inhibited by the pneumococcal capsule and it is puzzling how these phages can thrive in natural settings among encapsulated clinical isolates. many encapsulated pneumococcal strains also carry prophages and were thus infected by phages at some point . on the other hand, pneumococcal strains that lack a capsule have been isolated from conjunctivitis cases  <cit> . the conversion between encapsulated and unencapsulated states is not uncommon in s. pneumoniae however and may be an important factor in population dynamics  <cit>  and favor phage infection. alternatively, the nasopharynx is host to the related streptococcus mitis which was shown to support the replication of pneumophages, at least in the case of socp and dp- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, non-typeable strains of s. pneumoniae  were shown to have significantly higher probabilities to act as dna donor in dna recombination events compared to strains with well-defined capsule types  <cit> . whether this is due to phage-mediated lysis is not known but it is worrying that non-typeable strains of s. pneumoniae also appear to be highly enriched in antibiotic resistance alleles  <cit> . it might thus be worth assessing whether sensitivity to lytic phages makes unencapsulated  strains a potential major reservoir to enhance the flow of resistance genes.

in conclusion, this study reported on the use of whole genome sequencing to expedite the identification of novel pneumococcal genes involved in phage-host interactions. it also suggested that different host factors are involved in the replication of phages belonging to different phage families.
