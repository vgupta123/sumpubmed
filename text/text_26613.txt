BACKGROUND
many recent studies that sequenced large numbers of individuals have shown that human populations have experienced a complex demographic history, including a recent epoch of rapid growth in effective population size, although estimates have varied greatly among studies  <cit> . the growth of european population has recently been estimated to be exponential with a rate of 2-5% per-generation increase in population size  <cit> . this recent growth has resulted in an excess of rare single nucleotide variants , commonly defined as those with a minor allele  frequency  of less than  <dig> %  in a sample of individuals from the same population . the proportion of singletons  is especially elevated due to this recent rapid growth  <cit> . consequently, the corresponding site frequency spectrum , a summary statistic that indicates the proportion of variants of each possible allele count in the sample  is skewed towards lower allele counts.

a predicted consequence of the skew in the sfs due to population growth is an increase in the burden of private mutations for each individual. we recently defined this quantity as the proportion of heterozygous positions in each newly sequenced individual that are novel, i.e., completely absent from a previously sequenced sample from the same population  <cit> . in that previous paper, we observed this burden to be higher in samples from populations of european and east asian descent than is predicted by previously estimated demographic models that do not include an epoch of recent population growth  <cit> . however, empirical estimates in that paper were based on a small sample size of less than  <dig> individuals, while the contribution of recent rapid growth is expected to be more pronounced for larger sample sizes  <cit> .

here, we set out to  empirically estimate the burden of private mutations from large samples of individuals of european ancestry,  compare these estimates with predictions of previously proposed demographic models with and without a recent epoch of exponential growth  <cit> , and  contrast snvs of different functions that are expected to have undergone different selective effects. as purifying, negative selection on deleterious snvs skews the sfs towards rare variants  <cit> , it can interact with the effect of recent population growth in increasing the burden of private snvs, and differently so for different functional categories. with the rapidly decreasing cost of sequencing, more and more high-quality sequencing data sets of large sample sizes and improved accuracy of detecting rare variants become available. this provides an excellent opportunity for a more accurate study of the burden of private mutations. in this paper, we considered two such sequencing data sets of samples from populations of european ancestry: the nhlbi exome sequencing project   <cit>  <cit>  and the neutral regions  data set of putatively neutral regions  <cit> .

RESULTS
in all analyses, we contrast three different demographic models and the fit of their predictions to the nr data set  <cit>  and to  <dig> functional categories of the esp data set  <cit> . the three demographic models are  a population that has been of constant population size throughout history,  a model of european history that includes two population bottlenecks  <cit> , and  a model of european history with two bottlenecks, a recent change in population size, followed by a recent epoch of rapid population growth  <cit>  .

comparison of site frequency spectra
as the burden of private mutations is a function of the site frequency spectrum, we first contrasted the site frequency spectra between three demographic models, the nr data  <cit> , and the esp data  <cit>  . in order to allow comparison of the data sets with different sample sizes, as well as account for missing genotype calls for each snv, we probabilistically subsampled all data to a sample size of  <dig> haploid chromosomes .

the proportion of singletons from demographic models  and  is greatly lower than that in the observed data and that predicted by model , where recent growth is incorporated . among the categories of the esp data, categories that are expected to be more functional show a higher proportion of singletons, e.g. intronic, intergenic, synonymous, and utr snvs have a significantly lower proportion than non-synonymous, nonsense, and splice snvs , which is expected by the latter being more often deleterious. these results recapitulate those from the esp  <cit> . the proportion of singletons in the snvs from the nr data is lower than all categories of snvs from esp, which is consistent with the former being designed such that variants are very far from genes and putatively neutral  <cit> , while the latter consists of variants in and near protein-coding genes  <cit> , which are expected to more often be targeted by purifying selection. another factor that can contribute to this difference between the nr and esp datasets is that the former aimed to capture a sample of homogenous ancestry, which corresponds to north-western european ancestry  <cit> , while the latter consists of a broad sample of european americans that exhibits a higher level of population structure  <cit> . increased population structure can lead to an increase in the proportion of rare variants since some of these can be due to mutations that postdate the split of the population captured by the different ancestries  <cit> .

comparison of the burden of private mutations
the predicted burden of private mutations for each individual from all demographic models and the empirical burden observed in the different data sets and functional categories are presented in figure  <dig>  across all sample sizes, the burden of private mutations from empirical data is significantly higher than that predicted by demographic models without growth. for example, based on the results of the nr data, when  <dig> individuals have been sequenced, we estimated that about  <dig> % out of all heterozygous sites in the 101st sequenced individual are novel, that is specific to the 101st individual and completely absent from the first set of  <dig> individuals. while models  and  predict only 1% in this scenario, model  is consistent with this estimate in the nr data.

for all demographic models and observed data, as more individuals are sequenced, the burden of private mutations decreases , because increasing sample size makes it more probable that a variant has already been discovered  <cit> . at the same time, the effect of recent growth itself on the burden of private mutations is much more pronounced with increasing sample size. for example, for the nr data, when  <dig> individuals are sequenced, the estimated burden of mutation from the 493rd sequenced individual is about  <dig> % . the estimations from models  and  are only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, about a third of empirical data, while model  matches the data well. we note that this percentage varies greatly across individuals with the relatively small number of snvs in the nr data .

when extrapolating the models to consider a scenario in which  <dig>  individuals are sequenced, model  predicts the burden of mutations of the  <dig> st individual to be  <dig> % , 24-times and 18-times that from models without recent growth that predict  <dig> % and  <dig> % based on models  and , respectively . this corresponds to almost  <dig> of  <dig> heterozygous positions, which is equivalent to about  <dig>  variants genome-wide. this estimate is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the expected number of de novo mutations of each individual . hence, we predict that thousands of novel variants will be discovered in each newly sequenced genome even after tens of thousands of genomes from exactly the same population have already been sequenced with perfect accuracy, and that these are rarely due to de novo mutations.

constant population

the burden of private mutations and the standard deviation of the sample for three demographic models and the nr data. the results correspond to n =  <dig>  the sample size of the nr data less one, as they are based on the individuals from that dataset. these results are not based on randomized chromosomes, but rather on the actual genotype information for each individual in turn. for the three demographic models, sequences were simulated with the same number of snvs as in the nr data . the number in parenthesis denotes the standard deviation of the sample. these large standard deviations suggest a significant variation in percentage of private mutations across individuals when the small number of snvs from the nr dataset is considered.

another important observation is that the burden of private mutations for each individual calculated from all seven categories of the esp data is consistently higher than that from the nr data for all sample sizes . this is consistent with the observation that the sfs of the esp data are more left-skewed than those of the nr data, which is consistent with decreased effect of purifying selection and population structure on the latter. comparing the different esp categories, splice and non-sense snvs, which are expected to most often be deleterious, have the largest burden of private mutations across all sample sizes. similarly, the burden of all functional categories is ordered by common expectations as to how often such mutations are expected to be functional. the burden of private mutations captures a unique summary of the sfs that more clearly shows the effect of purifying selection. for example, when n =  <dig>  the proportion of singletons is  <dig> % for the esp intergenic snvs and  <dig> % for the esp splice snvs, which is  <dig> -fold. in comparison, the burden of private mutations for splice snvs is about  <dig> -fold of that for intergenic snvs. this difference is even more pronounced when the sample size is larger, with  <dig> -fold different when n =  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
recent whole-genome sequencing data sets show that the proportion of rare variants in large samples, especially singletons, is significantly elevated compared with the prediction from the standard coalescent theory that assumes a constant population size and from previous demographic models without recent growth  <cit> . recent demographic modeling studies predict that humans have experienced a recent and rapid population growth, which explains an increased proportion of singletons and other rare variants  <cit> . in this paper, we examined the burden of private mutations for each individual, a statistic that reflects the relationship between the relative proportions of singletons and more common variants contained in a sample, with three demographic models and two data sets under different sample sizes. we found that the burden of private mutations calculated from empirical data and estimated from demographic models with a recent growth is significantly higher than that estimated from models without recent growth across all sample sizes. the discrepancy is predicted to be much more pronounced for larger number of sequenced individuals. we showed that this finding is consistent with a recent epoch of population growth. moreover, we found that the snvs that are affected by stronger purifying selection will generally have larger burden of private mutations compared with more selectively neutral snvs, since they will have a higher proportion of singletons.

the proportion of private mutations that we consider translates to the number of novel variants expected to be ascertained with each newly sequenced genome. hence, our results have implications to sequencing-based association studies of complex human diseases and other sequencing studies. for instance, we predict that even after  <dig>  individuals from the exact same european population have been perfectly sequenced, still  <dig> in  <dig> heterozygous sites will be novel in each newly sequenced genome, which corresponds to discovering about  <dig>  new variants. this large expectation is due to the effect of the recent rapid growth of european populations, which leads to this number being at least 18-fold that predicted in the absence of such growth. hence, careful consideration must be given to private mutations in the design and analysis of sequencing-based association studies and in quantifying the role played by rare variants in complex human disease  <cit> .
