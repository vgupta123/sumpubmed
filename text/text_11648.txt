BACKGROUND
mirnas are one family of small  non-coding rnas. they regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally through binding to the complementary sites of target mrnas in the 3′-utr, and play an important role in regulating diverse biological processes  <cit> .

recently, mirna have been demonstrated as regulators of processes involved in physiological stress adaptation, including inflammation  <cit> , angiogenesis  <cit> , mitochondrial metabolism  <cit> , muscle force generation  <cit> . however, just a few studies were published to date describing the changes in mirna expression during exercise of different intensity  <cit> . they did not include the analysis of post-exercise recovery period and thus provided no information concerning dynamics of the predicted mirna-mrna regulatory pairs. detailed investigation of mirna-mrna networks specifically regulated by exercise could reveal important biomarkers of exercise physiology and would provide for deep insight into the molecular control of the stress response.

mirnas regulate target gene expression in different ways including mrna degradation and translation inhibition  <cit> . the target genes which were regulated by mirnas through mrna degradation are anti-correlated with the mirna regulators. in this study, for the first time whole transcriptome changes were monitored during exercise followed by 30 min and 60 min of recovery period and differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas were analysed resulting in identification of four dynamically regulated mirna-mrna networks.

RESULTS
anthropometric and physiological data
to exclude possible effects of gender, only male subjects were recruited for this study. anthropometric and physiological parameters of athletes are presented in table  <dig>  before exercise the serum lactate level was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm. after exercise, it was mildly elevated, but still below  <dig>  mm, confirming that the exercise performed was moderate without transgression of the anaerobic threshold.

values are mean ± sd.

branched-chain amino acids  include three structurally related amino acids leucine , isoleucine , and valine . the initial steps of their degradation are catalyzed by the same set of mitochondrial enzymes, and therefore, the bcaa behave as a very homogenous group. their regulation is performed by short-term metabolic control reflecting consuming of energy sources. it has been shown previously that an acute bout of prolonged exercise increases the rate of bcaa oxidation by skeletal muscle  <cit> . we observed a slight increase in the bcaa level immediately after exercise followed by a decline below base level during recovery . the ratio of citrulline  to ornithine  is indicative of the ornithine carbamoylphosphate transferase activity and characterizes the regulation of the urea cycle pathway  <cit> . this ratio had a tendency to increase . the ratios of methionine sulfoxide  to methionine  and tyrosine  to phenylalanine  indicate oxidative stress  <cit> . we found a decrease in met-so/met and a slight increase in tyr/phe .

abbreviations: bcaa branched-chain amino acids, cit citrulline, orn ornithine, met-so methionine sulfoxide, met methionine, tyr tyrosine, phe phenylalanine.

the data summarized in table  <dig> confirmed that the exercise was moderate and athletes reacted as normal healthy subjects  <cit> .

flow cytometry analysis
changes in white blood cell subpopulations in response to exercise are presented in table  <dig>  total white blood cell counts revealed the expected exercise-induced leukocytosis. nk lymphocytes  substantially contributed to the observed changes which was consistent with the published data  <cit> . however nk-specific mrnas  in the whole blood did not demonstrate similar nearly 3-fold increase  thus confirming that our subsequent microarray analysis showed true changes in rna expression.

values are mean ± sd.

mirna and mrna differential expression profiles
the mirna and mrna expression profiles in the whole blood for each time point and each athlete were determined using microarray analysis. paxgene rna tubes enable the isolation of intracellular rna of circulating leukocytes, including b cells, t cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and other less abundant cell types. furthermore, a large proportion of reticulocyte-derived globin mrna is prepared from paxgene blood rna tubes, as it has been demonstrated previously  <cit> . affymetrix genechip human gene  <dig>  st arrays contain both mirna and mrna probes and are capable of measuring about  <dig>  mrnas and  <dig> mirnas.

the data are presented in additional file  <dig>   <dig> mrnas and  <dig> mirnas were changed significantly , including hsa-mir-21-5p, hsa-mir-24-2-5p, hsa-mir-27a-5p, hsa-mir-181a-5p and hsa-mir-181b-5p. remarkably, hsa-mir-24-2-5p is clustered with hsa-mir-27a-5p, and hsa-mir-181a-5p is clustered with hsa-mir-181b-5p. consistently, the clustered mirnas exhibited similar expression profiles over time .

pathway analysis of differentially expressed mrnas
all  <dig> differentially expressed mrnas were analysed for enriched metabolic pathways. table  <dig> indicates the revealed pathways including immune response and glycoproteins. as expected, they were previously reported to be associated with exercise  <cit>  thus confirming the relevance of our experimental model.

pathway analysis of mrna targets of differentially expressed mirnas
all  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas have  <dig> validated target mrnas in total. we performed pathway enrichment analysis for these mrnas . again, the revealed pathways are highly relevant to exercise, e.g. transcription regulation, apoptosis, response to stress etc.

it has been demonstrated that the same mrnas can be targeted by more than one mirna which provides for more efficient and specific regulation  <cit> . we found  <dig> mrnas which are known to be validated targets for  <dig> or even  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas. they have higher potential to be involved in exercise-induced regulation. table  <dig> shows the pathways enriched with some of these mrnas. notably, these exercise-relevant pathways  comprise significant number of intersecting mrnas. figure  <dig> presents the identified regulatory mirna-mrna network for all  <dig> revealed pathways. interestingly, some of these genes are known to interact with each other. namely transcription factor myc was reported to be functionally associated with rna helicase ddx3x  <cit> , apoptosis regulator bcl <dig>  <cit>  and tumor suppressor brca <dig>  <cit> . brca <dig> in turn interacts itself with bcl <dig>  <cit>  and transcription factor e2f <dig>  <cit> . the presented data support the regulatory role of identified mirnas in response to exercise.

dynamically regulated mirna-mrna networks
we monitored the transcriptome expression level before and following exercise and this allowed us to reveal dynamically regulated mirna-mrna networks. we used a two-step approach to identify the mrna targets for the differentially expressed mirnas. first, we looked for anti-correlating groups of mirnas and mrnas expression of which over time tended to have opposite profiles. target mrna degradation is one of the mechanisms of mirna action when their perfect complementarity occurs  <cit> . thus, the second step of our strategy was either analysis of published data and selection of experimentally validated target mrnas for a given mirna or theoretical prediction of mirna targets based on their complementarity, using one of the most popular web resources targetscan  <cit> . the expression profiles and biological function of selected mirnas and mrnas were analysed in more detail. based on this analysis, our final identified mirna-mrna pairs have a high probability of being involved in the regulation of exercise-related physiological processes.

hsa-mir-21-5p
mirna hsa-mir-21-5p demonstrated different expression profiles over time  however remarkably anti-correlating with experimentally validated target mrnas tgfbr <dig> , pdgfd  and ppm1l  . rhobtb <dig> mrna  predicted by targetscan to be a potential target for hsa-mir-21-2-5p behaved similarly. we observed the up-regulation of hsa-mir-21-5p one hour after exercise. the differences in kinetics can be potentially explained by individualities of each athlete.

the expression level of hsa-mir-21-5p itself is known to be stress-responsive and play an important role in heart failure  <cit>  and renal ischemia reperfusion injury  <cit> . notably the up-regulation of circulating hsa-mir-21-5p was recently reported to occur in plasma upon exercise  <cit> . the overall action of hsa-mir-21-5p has been described by several authors to be strongly anti-inflammatory  <cit> . note, that 60 min into relaxation, there was an up-regulation of hsa-mir-21-5p in all  <dig> subjects. this may reflect the self-protective anti-inflammatory reaction to exercise.

we identified four pairing targets for this mirna namely tgfbr <dig>  pdgfd, ppm1l, and rhobtb <dig>  tgfbr <dig> is a transforming growth factor -beta type iii receptor, mrna of which is known to be up-regulated in the peripheral blood leukocytes in allograft rejection-prone recipients after intestinal transplantation thus mediating innate and adaptive inflammatory functions of leukocytes  <cit> . pdgfd encodes for platelet derived growth factor d  <cit> , a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family which can regulate many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, transformation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis  <cit> . ppm1l encodes a protein phosphatase gene  <cit>  responsible for the regulation of stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade and apoptosis  <cit> . finally, the fourth identified target for hsa-mir-21-5p is rhobtb <dig> mrna  <cit>  which encodes for the rho gtpase regulating the membrane traffic of proteins  <cit> . interestingly, this mrna proved to be a blood biomarker of psychosis and shows a decreased expression level in high hallucinations states  <cit> .

hsa-mir-24-2-5p
mirna hsa-mir-24-2-5p  was up-regulated immediately after exercise, then tended to decrease during the recovery period except athlete d . in our study for the first time we report the reaction to exercise of this mirna which is known to have protective effects on myocytes against myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis  <cit> .

myc mrna  which is known to be the target for this mirna from the literature, and kcnj <dig> mrna  predicted by targetscan to be a potential target essentially followed anti-profile of hsa-mir-24-2-5p. the protein encoded by the myc gene is a multifunctional, nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. it functions as a transcription factor that regulates transcription of specific target genes. interestingly, hsa-mir-24-2-5p is known to be up-regulated during hematopoietic cell terminal differentiation suppressing myc expression  <cit> . thus the increase of this mirna we observed  may reflect the regulation of hematopoiesis upon exercise. remarkably, myc mrna is among those which are regulated by  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, namely hsa-mir-21-5p and hsa-mir-24-2-5p , however its expression profile is anti-correlated with only the profile of hsa-mir-24-2-5p .

kcnj <dig> protein is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel participating in establishing the action potential waveform and excitability of neuronal and muscle tissues  <cit> . this mrna expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a biomarker for parkinson’s disease  <cit> .

hsa-mir-27a-5p
mirna hsa-mir-27a-5p is clustered with hsa-mir-24-2-5p and behaved similarly to it increasing after exercise and decreasing during the recovery period except athlete d  with the adjusted p-value  <dig> . this mirna was reported to promote myoblast proliferation by reducing the expression of myostatin  <cit> .

the only mrna target identified is predicted by targetscan st3gal <dig>  the encoded protein belongs to the sialyltransferase family and is responsible for the synthesis of selectin ligands  <cit> .

hsa-mir-181a-5p
hsa-mir-181a-5p tended to increase after exercise and then to down-regulate during the first as well as the second period of the relaxation time  with an adjusted p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  the observed differential expression of hsa-mir-181a-5p in our athletes is consistent with previously published results  <cit> . this mirna is characterized as a regulator of hematopoietic lineage differentiation  <cit>  and a modulator of t cell sensitivity and selection  <cit> . radom-aizik showed up-regulation of this mirna after 30 min interval exercise. they related it to increased t cell responsiveness and reduced susceptibility to infection due to physical activity. in our study  <dig> subjects showed up-regulation immediately after exercise .

the mrnas ropn1l  and slc37a <dig>  were previously validated to be targets for hsa-mir-181a-5p and demonstrated pronounced anti-correlation with the mirna expression profile. the ropn1l gene encodes a member of the ropporin family. the encoded protein is involved in the targeting towards specific physiological substrates of protein kinase a, regulating glycogen, sugar, and lipid metabolism  <cit> . the slc37a <dig> protein belongs to transmembrane sugar transporters and is responsible for sugar metabolism  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified metabolic pathways enriched with differentially expressed mrnas and with mrna targets of differentially expressed mirnas, including mrnas known to be regulated by  <dig> or  <dig> mirnas described here. the result supports previously published data. moreover, we revealed four mirna-mrna networks dynamically regulated following exercise. these observations provide a novel insight into the potential regulatory role of mirnas in the numerous physiological processes involved in stress adaptation.
