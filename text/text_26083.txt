BACKGROUND
post-translational modification  is the chemical modification of a protein after its translation. during protein synthesis, a protein is build using twenty different amino acids, yet after translation a post-translational modification of amino acids can be observed by attaching to them other biochemical functional groups such as acetate, phosphate, various lipids and carbohydrates, by changing the chemical nature of an amino acid, or by making structural changes, like the formation of disulfide bridges. in the advent of massive  sequencing experiments, the availability of whole proteomes requires accurate computational techniques for investigation of protein modification sites for the high-throughput scale. to address these needs we propose here our improved technique to identify ptm sites by using artificial neural network, trained on proteins from the current version of swiss-prot database  <cit>  and phospho.elm dataset  <cit> .

the automatic prediction of ptm sites is now very important area of interest for the bioinformatics research community. the currently available ptm prediction tools can be categorized into four major groups based on the used types of classification schemes. the first category includes general ptm related resources like elm  <cit>  that perform rapid regular expression pattern search in order to predict eukaryotic linear motifs  in protein sequences. another web service, namely prosite  <cit>  predicts many types of ptms based on the consensus of sequence patterns. consensus based approaches combine several signature recognition methods to scan a given query protein sequence against observed protein signatures. the scansite tool  <cit>  predicts kinase-specific and signal transduction relevant motifs. the conserved sequence motifs represent footprints of important biochemical properties or biological functions performed by those proteins. gps approach predicts kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from protein primary sequences for  <dig> different pk groups by family-based phosphorylation scoring technique  <cit> . the phosite  <cit>  algorithm for prediction of phosphorylation sites is based on case-based sequence analysis to obtain predictions with constant specificity and sensitivity.

the second class of methods covers different neural network prediction tools. these include phosphorylation related prediction servers like netphos  <cit>  and netphosk  <cit> , glycosylation based tools like netoglyc  <cit> , netnglyc, dictyoglyc  <cit> , yinoyang  <cit> , prediction of cleavage sites in protein sequences  <cit> , prediction of n-terminal myristoylation on protein sequences  <cit>  and many others. the most popular among these servers is netphosk that allows the user to choice its preferred 'threshold' value during prediction. in our manuscript we present the results with three threshold levels:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for making the predictions and they are called respectively as netphosk_ <dig> , netphosk_ <dig>  and netphosk_ <dig> .

the third category of methods involves several support vector machine  based prediction techniques. among the recent works, protein methylation site prediction is attempted using bayesian feature extraction technique and svm based classifier  <cit> . in another work, the prediction of lysine acytelation sites is done using svm  <cit>  based classifiers. predphospho  <cit>  is another svm based system that attempts to predict phosphorylation sites and the type of kinase that acts at each site. our previously developed web-server automotifserver   <cit>  for prediction of post-translational modification sites in protein sequences, also uses svm classifier with both linear and polynomial kernels. this software is available freely at http://ams <dig> bioinfo.pl/. kinasephos  <dig>   <cit>  is another web server for identifying protein kinase-specific phosphorylation sites based on  <dig> amino acid long sequences and coupling patterns. there are several options provided in this prediction program, including three different levels of specificity: 90%, 95% and 100%. these three options are named respectively kinasephos_ <dig>  kinasephos_ <dig> and kinasephos_ <dig> 

the fourth category consists from the remaining other types of machine learning based ptm prediction tools. it includes for example sulfinator  <cit>  that predicts tyrosine sulfation sites using a combination of hmm models; prediction of glycosylation sites using random forests  <cit> ; ppsp prediction of pk-specific phosphorylation sites  <cit>  that deploys bayesian decision theory ; and many others. the ppsp predicted the plausible phosphorylation sites accurately for approximately  <dig> pk  groups. for our tests we choose the ppsp_balanced model that seems to provide the best overall performance for all types of protein families. in the important work of wan et al.  <cit>  the efficient meta predictor is designed that organize and process predictions from individual source prediction algorithms. they compiled and evaluated their technique on four unbiased phosphorylation site datasets, namely the four major protein kinase families: cdk, ck <dig>  pka and pkc. in addition to the aforementioned classification software/tools, the dbptm database  <cit>  compiles diverse information on protein post-translational modifications , such as the catalytic sites, solvent accessibility of amino acid residues, protein secondary and tertiary structures, protein domains and protein variations. the database includes a majority of the experimentally validated ptm sites from swiss-prot, phosphoelm and o-glycbase. the recent survey  <cit>  describes available resources for predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from sequence properties. they compare strengths and weaknesses of variety of prediction tools, as described above.

despite almost ten years of work and above reported computational solutions, still we are unable to boost the precision of in silico methods to be really useful in high throughput context of personalized medicine. therefore, the present research improvements concentrate on two important factors. the first is to further optimize prediction accuracy in comparison with the current state-of-the-art methods for variety of ptm sites, especially focusing on selecting more informative feature descriptors. the second factor is the speed of a prediction procedure that is needed for the virtual screening of whole proteomes. therefore, we present here an extensively optimization scheme for selecting the most informative amino acids features, than used for training the very fast machine learning method, namely artificial neural network.

we have improved significantly the accuracy of the previous versions of ams prediction tool  <cit>  using an efficiently designed multi layer perceptron  pattern classifier. in the current version of the tool, the query protein sequences are dissected into overlapping short segments. ten different physico-chemical features represent each amino acid from a sequence segment; therefore the nine amino acids segment is represented as the point in a  <dig> dimensional abstract space of protein characteristics. the mlp used in this work, special artificial neural network  algorithm, is developed to replicate learning and generalization abilities of human's behavior with an attempt to model the functions of biological neural networks of the human brain. the mlp architecture is build from a feed-forward layered network of artificial neurons, where each artificial neuron in the mlp computes a sigmoid function of the weighted sum of all its inputs.

the mlp based anns  are observed to be capable of classifying highly complex and nonlinear biological sequence patterns, where correlations between amino acid positions are important. unlike earlier attempts, in the current design of the neural network we have implemented three different network models for each of the ptm types, by independently optimizing the network weights for three factors: optimum recall ; precision; and maximizing the receiver operating characteristics of the prediction model. the consensus build by those three anns for each type of ptm gives an additional advantage in comparison to the previously reported ann based ptm prediction models. in our previous publications on ams  <cit> , the svm based classification model failed to classify several ptm types with limited number of positive samples. the current mlp based design is much better suited to highly unbalanced ratio between positives and negatives in the training dataset, therefore preferred over the previously chosen svm based approach.

summarizing, the ams  <dig>  tool  integrates heterogeneous classification schemes for different ptm types, and it is designed to boost both the efficiency and speed in comparison with previously presented computational methods. as discussed earlier, the neural network is designed in much more efficient and unique way to predict post-translational modifications than previously used ann algorithms. a detailed discussion on the architecture of the neural network, details of the machine learning algorithm is given in the first section. the next section presents the results on several benchmarking datasets, and finally the discussion part of the paper report the major advances of our work.

RESULTS
the performance of the networks is evaluated on the training and test datasets for each of the ptm types. during training of the feed-forward neural network with back-propagation learning algorithm, the learning rate  and acceleration factors  are chosen as  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the classification performance is described by the following measures of accuracy:   

where, tp is the number of true positives, fp is the number of false positives, tn is the number of true negatives, and fn is the number of false negatives. the classification error  is used to provide an overall error measure, recall  corresponds to the percentage of correct predictions, precision  measures the percentage of observed positives that are correctly predicted, true positive rate  is similar to recall or sensitivity measure and false positive rate  estimates the false alarm rate or fall-out. we also estimate the receiver operating characteristic  by plotting the fraction of true positives  vs. the fraction of false positives . more specifically, the roc curves are drawn for both training and test datasets in each of the three runs of experiment, i.e., optimal auc, recall and precision values. this roc analysis provides a tool to select possibly optimal network models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from the class distribution. the area under the roc curve  is also calculated in the current experiment and presented in table  <dig>  the auc is equivalent to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one  <cit> .

the detailed performance analysis of the current software using three random sub-sample validations on training and test datasets of different ptm types is given in the additional file  <dig>  the three sets of results  for each ptm type corresponds to the training of the network based on the optimized auc area, recall and precision values for the random test dataset under consideration. each such network is trained with possible variations of hidden neurons from  <dig> to  <dig> . the number of hidden neurons, for which a given network is observed to give best possible recognition accuracy, is also listed in the detailed experimental datasheet of the additional file  <dig>  it may be observed that the high recall value , reasonable precision  and auc area  is achieved on independent test datasets of most of the ptm types.

the performance of the current technique is observed to be significantly better for most ptm types in comparison with the results of the previous version of automotif server, i.e., ams  <dig> . in ams  <dig> , classification results using support vector machine on the training datasets for respective ptm types are shown, which improved the earlier recognition performance of the earlier version of the server ams  <dig>   <cit> . a relative comparison of the training set results of our technique with the corresponding results of the ams  <dig>  is shown in table  <dig>  detailed results related to respective test set accuracies and due to variations in nomenclature, the current version of swiss prot dataset sometimes could not be matched precisely with all the ptm types, experimented in ams <dig>  however, a detailed experiment is also conducted with the old dataset to show the level of improvement for the current methodology. the results in both cases  clearly indicate that the developed software outperforms/improves the performance of the previous server.

many researchers concentrated their efforts on prediction of four major kinase families, namely cdk, ck <dig>  pka and pkc. to compare the current technique with the existing ones, we have conducted detailed experiments with those four kinase families from the latest phospho.elm dataset. figure  <dig>  shows scopes of aucs for these four kinase families for the train and test datasets of ams <dig>  in the current work we have compared the performance of ams <dig> with the existing state-of-the-art prediction systems for phosphorylation sites in protein sequences. figure  <dig> shows a comparative analysis of the current technique with standard predictors, namely gps, kinasephos, netphosk, ppsp, predphospho, scansite and meta predictor. table  <dig> lists the comparative performances, i.e. sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, of aforementioned prediction systems  with the current one. in another comparison, we have plotted the roc curves of the four kinase families figure  <dig> for different runs of trainset/testset results for ams <dig> and compared the same with claimed roc values of the standard predictors.

among the other comparable works in this domain, the netphos  <dig>  server predicts serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins and netphosk  <dig>  server  <cit>  predicts kinase specific eukaryotic protein phosphoylation sites. similar to our approach, both servers use neural network based classifiers for prediction of amino acid sequences. the performance of the netphosk server is reported on  <dig> different ptm types, i.e. pka, pkc, cam-ii, cdc <dig> and ckii on independent test datasets. table  <dig> shows the comparative analysis of best recognition performances of both the servers on test samples of comparable ptm types. it can be observed that our current technique also shows superior performances in all the cases under consideration. due to variations in nomenclature and datasets, the further  comparison with netphosk and other available servers could not be carried out exhaustively.

average execution time for the current software is around  <dig> ms for  <dig> entries of short amino acid sequences. each such short sequence contains nine amino acids, extracted from a complete fasta formatted protein sequence. the experiment is conducted on a moderately powerful desktop with  <dig>  ghz processor and  <dig> mb primary memory in linux based operating environment.

discussion
the present method provides a fast and accurate system for prediction of post-translational modification sites that is capable of classifying highly complex local biological sequence features. the current design of the neural network implements three different network models for each of the ptm types by independently optimizing the network weights for optimum recall/precision/auc values on randomly chosen test patterns.

the efficiency of classification and the prediction power of our method, estimated on training and test datasets for each ptm types using the sensitivity , precision values and area under roc curves, clearly outperforms the previously reported results. as evident in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the current technique improves the earlier versions of the automotifserver  and also outperforms the other state-of-the-art systems, gps, kinasephos, netphosk, ppsp, predphospho, scansite and meta predictor, designed for kinase-specific prediction of phosphorylation sites in protein sequences. for comparison with our earlier version of ams, the new swiss prot dataset could not be used because of the new nomenclature in the current version. therefore, we partially ran the experiments with the old version of the dataset. however in the case of phospho.elm, the complete experimentation is done, together with the new version of the swiss prot dataset. significant differences in the performance of differently optimized neural networks  are observed, yet the ams  <dig>  tool integrates those heterogeneous classification schemes and it is able to boost the precision and recall values independent of a ptm type in comparison. performances of ams <dig> are also evaluated on four kinase families cdk, ck <dig>  pka and pkc and compared with the aforementioned predictor systems. we could observe that the performance of the current technique is comparable with the best among the rest. however, there are cases when the current technique fails to beat all other predictors. as shown in figure  <dig>  for the best auc value for kinase type pkc, meta predictor outperforms ams <dig>  similarly, in case of kinase type ck <dig>  ams <dig> comes third, below netphosk and ppsp. in another illustration related to roc values, similar findings could be observed, where the roc values of different predictors and their variations mostly come within roc curves of ams <dig> train sets and independent test sets.

there are two key reasons behind the performance boost of the current version of the ams. firstly, prudent choice of the feature descriptors from the aaindex database by exhaustive trial and error with different possible features. secondly, the choice and design of the mlp base classifier. despite popular choice of svm in binary classification problems, we have got better accuracy with mlp by exhaustively tuning variety of learning parameters and experimented on a wide range of hidden neuron variations. the prudent choice of train/test ratios in positive and negative samples and the novel idea of optimizing respective networks separately on peak auc/recall/precision values, also boosted the overall performance preserving the generality of the tool.

the current technique is very fast in comparison to our previously developed svm based version of the server. as mentioned earlier, the average prediction time for  <dig> short amino acid sequences is estimated at around  <dig> ms on a standard desktop computer. in a nutshell, the mlp based pattern classifier, with independent recall/precision/auc optimized networks, along with an effective feature descriptor is found to be more suitable to the massive prediction of post-translational modifications for whole proteomes. the availability of the precompiled, standalone version allows for high-throughput screening of large sequence datasets, the main problem that the scientific proteome community is now considering heavily.

CONCLUSIONS
summarizing, the ams  <dig>  tool integrates heterogeneous classification schemes for different ptm types, and it is designed to boost both the efficiency and speed in comparison with previously presented computational methods. our fast and accurate system for prediction of post-translational modification sites in protein sequences is capable of classifying highly complex and nonlinear biological sequence patterns. we have implemented three different network models for each of the ptm types by optimizing the model for optimum recall/precision/auc. the features for the current experiment are chosen by exhaustive experimentation on the aaindex database, based on the previously proven amino acid characteristics for prediction of side chain interaction sites, secondary structure information and related attributes. the developed predictor tool, reads primary protein sequences in fasta format and decides whether an overlapping short amino acid sequence qualifies for a potential ptm site or not, along with a probabilistic confidence for such a decision. the user also specifies the type of ptm for a specific prediction and the nature of optimization required .
