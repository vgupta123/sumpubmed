BACKGROUND
ruminant species produce oestrogens in the cotyledons of their placentas. the functions of placental oestrogens change during gestation. first, together with progesterone, they are local activators of trophoblast growth and differentiation, acting via intracrine, autocrine or paracrine mechanisms . second, an oestrogen peak near term triggers endocrine and paracrine processes involved in the initiation of parturition, cervical softening and dilatation, and increasing myometrial contractibility . in ruminants, low oestrogen levels and a reduced prepartal oestrogen peak are associated with an increased abortion rate, dystocia, and placental retention  <cit> . oestrogens are synthesised by aromatisation of androgen precursors, which is catalysed by the enzyme aromatase cytochrome p <dig> . oestrogen biosynthesis in various tissues depends on the expression of the p450arom-encoding cyp <dig> gene, which involves tissue-specific promoters. tissue-specific cyp <dig> transcripts contain at their 5'ends unique untranslated exons, which, during processing, are spliced to a common acceptor site just upstream of the coding region  <cit> . accordingly, these tissues express identical p450arom proteins. the placenta-specific cyp <dig> promoter in the cow is p <dig>  . interestingly, placenta-specific promoters in humans  <cit>  and even in sheep  <cit>  are not orthologous to p <dig> .

to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms behind the expression of cyp <dig> in the bovine placenta we have analysed p <dig>  in vitro and by reporter gene experiments. we found that the e-box element at position - <dig> was required for full promoter activity in jeg <dig> cells, which served as a model for trophoblast cells. moreover, it has been demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays  that a placental transcription factor could specifically bind to the e-box   <cit> . the human placenta-specific promoter has also been extensively studied by others. it has been demonstrated in transgenic mice that a sequence of only  <dig> bp in this promoter could mediate placenta-specific expression of a transgene  <cit> . in cultured human trophoblast cells under hypoxic conditions, cyp <dig> expression was inhibited by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor mash- <dig>  though its binding to the cyp <dig> promoter was not demonstrated  <cit> . the inhibitory effects of hypoxia and mash- <dig> on cyp <dig> expression in the human placenta turned out to be mediated by binding of the transcription factors usf <dig> and usf <dig> to two e-box elements  <cit> . furthermore, surveys of the dna methylation status and of the chromatin structure of bovine and ovine placenta-specific promoters provided evidence of the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in tissue-specific and developmental regulation of cyp <dig> expression  <cit> .

the aim of the present work was the identification and characterisation of the placental transcription factor binding to the e-box  element  and to fully define these interactions as a step towards understanding the regulatory mechanism underlying the expression of cyp <dig> in the bovine placenta. to this end, we developed a procedure to enrich the e-bp from placental nuclear protein extracts by using immobilised e-box target dna. western blot analysis and supershift experiments revealed that the e-bp consists of the transcription factors usf <dig> and usf <dig>  their functional significance with regard to p <dig> -dependent gene expression was demonstrated by rnai-mediated knockdown experiments and by the expression of a dominant-negative usf mutant.

RESULTS
p <dig>  activity in primary bovine trophoblast cells
the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  was reassessed in a recently established tissue culture model of primary bovine trophoblast cells   <cit> . trophoblast cells were transiently transfected with p <dig>  reporter gene plasmids containing either a wild type or a mutated e-box motif, as described in materials and methods. cells were harvested  <dig> h later, and reporter gene activities were measured. the wild type p <dig>  clearly enhanced reporter gene expression in pbtc . upon inactivation of the e-box  by point mutations the reporter gene activity dropped significantly, and reached a level not significantly different from that of the promoterless control plasmid. the results show that the e-box  element is required for full promoter activity in bovine trophoblasts.

the e-box binding protein is composed of the transcription factors usf <dig> and usf2
a procedure was developed to enrich the e-bp from placental nuclear protein extracts. to optimise the yield of a specific e-bp/dna complex, and to reduce "unspecific" protein binding to non-e-box sites of the probe, unspecific competitor dna was added to the binding reactions. furthermore, we took advantage of an observation made during pilot experiments, that the e-bp was resistant to heat treatment at 65Â°c for  <dig> min. while most of the original e-bp activity was preserved, unspecific complexes were no longer detectable during emsa experiments . in small-scale experiments, heat-treated extracts were incubated with e-box target dna, which had been immobilised to paramagnetic dynabeads. as a control, experiments with mutated target sites were performed in parallel. the eluted proteins were analysed by sds-page. a 35-kda protein band was consistently detected with proteins eluted from the wild type, but not from the mutated e-box target sites . to identify the protein, the 35-kda band was cut out of the gel and processed for maldi-tof analysis. the obtained spectra, however, were not informative, due to contamination of the samples by bsa, which was an indispensable component of the elution buffer. omitting bsa resulted in the loss of the 35-kda band . nevertheless, the described features of the e-bp strikingly resembled those of the transcription factors usf  <dig> and usf <dig>  <cit> : first, e-bp and usf proteins bind to a cacatg core e-box element; second, usf proteins are the only known heat-stable e-box-binding transcription factors; and third, the molecular weights of bovine usf proteins as deduced from their cdna sequences  range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. we therefore hypothesised that the e-bp might be usf <dig> and/or usf <dig>  to demonstrate this experimentally, the eluted proteins were subjected to western blot analysis using commercial anti usf1- and anti usf2-igg. as shown in the figure 3a, both antibodies visualised a 35-kda band eluted from the wild type e-box targets. in contrast, no signal was obtained with eluates from mutated e-box targets. in supershift emsa experiments both antibodies, but not an unrelated igg , interacted with the e-bp complex. there was no evidence for more than one single complex suggesting that the e-bp is likely a heterodimer of usf <dig> and usf <dig> . taken together, our results demonstrate a specific interaction of the transcription factors usf <dig> and usf <dig> with the e-box  motif of the placenta-specific promoter p <dig> .

functional significance of usf <dig> and usf <dig> for p <dig>  activity
we used an rnai-based approach to assess the function of both usf transcription factors with regard to p <dig>  activity. pools of sirna targeting usf <dig> or usf <dig> transcripts were transfected into jeg <dig> trophoblast cells, and the transcripts were then measured by quantitative real-time pcr . as shown in figure 4a, both usf sirna pools specifically knocked down their respective usf transcripts. a control sirna pool, which does not target any known transcript, did not affect the usf transcripts. then, we transiently cotransfected jeg <dig> cells with the usf sirna pools, either individually or simultaneously, and with a reporter gene plasmid bearing p <dig> , to measure the effects of usf knockdowns on p <dig> -dependent transcription. the results are summarised in figure 4b. interestingly, transfection of either usf <dig> or usf <dig> sirna alone did not reduce p <dig>  activity. unexpectedly, usf <dig> knockdown even increased the promoter activity. however, the double knockdown of usf <dig> and usf <dig> transcripts was associated with a significant decrease in p <dig> -dependent reporter gene expression. hence, the two factors could substitute for each other, at least in the case of the reporter gene experiments in jeg <dig> cells.

to analyse more directly if usf factors indeed bind to the e-box , and thereby activate p <dig> -dependent transcription, we cotransfected jeg <dig> cells with a p <dig> -luciferase reporter gene vector and an expression plasmid for a dominant-negative usf mutant, a-usf  <cit> . a-usf specifically dimerises with endogeneous usf <dig> and usf <dig> and efficiently prevents usf binding to dna  <cit> . indeed, upon introduction of various amounts of the a-usf construct into the jeg <dig> cells, p <dig> -driven luciferase reporter gene activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner . lysates used for reporter gene measurements were also analysed by emsa experiments, which revealed that a-usf indeed inhibited the formation of the usf/e-box binding complex . to examine the relationship between p <dig>  activity and usf binding to the e-box , we plotted measurements of the reporter gene activity vs. usf/dna complex intensity, as determined by emsa experiments similar to the one shown in figure 5b. hence, in the scatter plot shown in figure 5c, each data point represents measurements of both parameters in one given lysate. a strong positive correlation between the two parameters was observed.

discussion
the e-box  is required for p <dig> -dependent transcription in pbtc
we studied the functional relevance of the e-box . results from reporter gene experiments with pbtc are in line with those of our earlier analyses with jeg <dig> cells  <cit> , but, unexpectedly, there were also remarkable differences. in pbtcs, the reporter gene activity significantly dropped upon inactivation of the e-box, reaching the level produced by the promoterless control plasmid. in contrast, our previous studies in jeg <dig> cells had revealed that p <dig>  activity dropped by only about 50%, and was still significantly higher than the reporter activity of the pgl <dig> control plasmid. only additional mutations in the hexameric motif at position - <dig> completely abrogated p <dig>  activity  <cit> . hence, the hexameric motif  is not needed for full p <dig>  activity in pbtc. this conclusion is also supported by our observation in emsa experiments that only nuclear extracts from jeg <dig> cells, not from bovine placenta, yielded specific binding complexes with a probe containing the hexameric motif .

the e-bp is composed of usf <dig> and usf2
our results from supershift emsa experiments and western blot analysis of the proteins eluted from the immobilised target oligonucleotides show that the ubiquitously expressed bhlh-leucine-zipper transcription factors usf <dig> and usf <dig> bind to the e-box , most likely as heterodimers. in most tissues and cell lines, usf1/usf <dig> heterodimers represent the major usf species  <cit> . the functional significance of usf binding to the e-box  is emphasised by results of rnai-mediated knockdown experiments. interestingly, p <dig> -dependent reporter gene activity was only decreased by double knockdown of the two usfs, suggesting at least partially overlapping functions of these two transcription factors. similar observations have been reported by others studying effects of usf gene targeting in mice  <cit> . during single knockdown experiments, we did not observe effects with usf <dig> sirna, but, surprisingly, reporter gene activity increased upon transfection of usf <dig> sirna. the underlying mechanism, however, is not yet understood. the use of the dominant-negative a-usf protein gave a direct analysis of the effects of usf binding to the e-box  on the transcriptional activity of p <dig> . this analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the two parameters. taken together, different kinds of experimental challenges , provoked consistent effects on p <dig>  activity in the trophoblast cell culture model, emphasising the potential importance of usf/e-box-interactions for p <dig> -dependent cyp <dig> expression in the bovine placenta.

how can ubiquitous usf transcription factors act in a cell/tissue-specific manner?
although usf <dig> and usf <dig> are ubiquitously expressed transcription factors  <cit> , p <dig> -derived cyp <dig> transcripts were predominantly found in the cotyledons of placentas  <cit> . however, both usf proteins are involved in cell/tissue-specific expression or developmental regulation of other genes as well, among them fshr and sf <dig>  <cit> . but the mere presence of usf proteins is not sufficient for productive interactions with p <dig> , because a second e-box motif at position - <dig>  despite being an efficient binding site during emsa experiments, proved to be irrelevant for promoter activity in vivo  <cit> . hence, possible additional conditions, which could include appropriate spacing with regard to other binding motifs, presence of other transcription factors or of cofactors, and accessibility of binding sites, must be fulfilled to achieve functional interactions. a highly conserved domain shared by usf <dig> and usf <dig>  termed the usf-specific region, putatively mediates cell-type-specific gene expression by interactions with a specialised coactivator  <cit> . accordingly, usf-activated cyp <dig> transcription in the placenta via p <dig>  might well involve additional, yet unknown transcription factors or cofactors that are not present in other tissues. on the other hand, confinement of usf activities to a set of cell-type/tissue-specific or developmentally regulated promoters could be mediated by epigenetic factors, such as dna methylation and chromatin structure. our recent results mapping dnasei hypersensitive sites within p <dig>  support this assumption  <cit> , and our finding in bovine placentomes that p <dig>  dna was unmethylated in the cyp19-expressing cotyledons, but methylated in the non-expressing caruncles  <cit> . in sheep dna methylation and chromatin accessibility of the placenta-specific cyp <dig> promoter correlated with expression levels as well  <cit> . interestingly, methylation of an e-box  prevented usf1/ <dig> binding and abrogated fshr transcription  <cit> . in the case of cyp <dig>  however, usf binding to p <dig>  cannot be prevented by methylation of the e-box  because its core sequence  does not feature a potential cpg methylation site.

usf binding to placenta-specific promoters from human and bovine cyp <dig> has opposite effects
several species, among them human, cattle and sheep, express cyp <dig> in their placentas. they use different, non-orthologous placenta-specific promoters, which are located  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  kb, respectively, upstream from the coding sequence  <cit> . comparative analysis of their functional protein/dna interactions might readily reveal transcription factors and respective promoter elements that are relevant for placenta-specific cyp <dig> expression. indeed, usf <dig> and usf <dig> interact with the bovine and human placenta-specific promoters, but with very different effects. the bovine e-box  clearly activated the p <dig> -dependent reporter gene expression in pbtc and also in jeg <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast, binding of usf to two e-box sites, at - <dig> of the human promoter and + <dig> in the adjacent untranslated exon, inhibited cyp <dig> expression in human cytotrophoblasts  <cit> . also in jeg <dig> cells cultured in a normoxic environment, comparable to that used in our study, sirna mediated double knockdown of usfs resulted in markedly increased levels of cyp <dig> mrna  <cit> . hence, the observed effects of usf binding depend on the context of the promoter.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we show that i) the e-box  element of the placenta-specific cyp <dig> promoter p <dig>  is required for full promoter activity in bovine trophoblasts and that ii) the transcription factors usf <dig> and usf <dig> interact with the e-box  and thereby activate p <dig> -dependent transcription. this suggests that usf <dig> and usf <dig> act in the opposite way on the bovine p <dig>  and the  human placenta-specific promoter. the results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that are involved to regulate p <dig> -dependent transcription in bovine trophoblasts.
