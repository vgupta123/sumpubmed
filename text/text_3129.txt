BACKGROUND
leaf rust is a fungal disease caused by puccinia triticina  which has been a serious threat to the world production of bread wheat  and other cereals over the past decades . the leaf rust pathogen is a biotrophic parasite with many physiological races that often are highly specific to wheat cultivars with compatible resistance genes. to date, at least  <dig> leaf rust  resistance genes have been identified, and the majority of them confer the race-specific resistance in the seedling stage  <cit> . however, a few race-nonspecific lr genes including lr <dig> and lr <dig> have been also found particularly at adult stage, conferring resistance to multiple pathogen species .

according to krattinger et al.  <cit> , the lr genes in wheat and other cereals may be divided into three groups based on their specificity and durability. the first group contains genes that confer race-specific resistance against one but not other races of the same pathogen species. as mentioned above, the majority of the lr genes are within this group. these lr genes often encode intracellular immune receptor proteins with nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeats . proteins encoded by r genes directly or indirectly perceive pathogen-derived virulence effectors that are secreted into the cytoplasm of host cells in order to suppress basal immunity. the second group contains genes that confer race-nonspecific resistance against multiple fungal pathogens simultaneously. the well-studied example in this group is lr <dig>  this locus was first reported by dyck  <cit>  and it was mapped on wheat chromosome 7d. it has been subsequently known to confer resistance against multiple diseases including leaf rust with the resistance gene named as lr <dig>  stem rust  with the resistance gene named as sr <dig>  stripe  rust  with the resistance gene named as yr <dig>  powdery mildew  with the resistance gene named as pm <dig> and barley yellow dwarf virus with the resistance gene named as bdv <dig> . thus, lr <dig> has other designations including lr34/yr <dig>  lr34/yr18/sr57/pm <dig> and lr34/yr18/sr57/pm38/bdv <dig> in the literature. lr <dig> has been molecularly characterized and it encodes a putative abc transporter containing transmembrane  and nucleotide binding  domains  <cit> . the third group, like the second group, confers race-nonspecific resistance, but unlike the second group, such resistance is against all races within the same pathogen species. a known example in this group is a gene with resistance to stripe  rust in wheat , and the resistance genes in the group are called start genes because they code for a start  protein  <cit> . additional examples of start genes in other cereal species include the recessive rice blast resistance gene pi <dig> encoding a small proline-rich protein  <cit> , and the recessive barley powdery mildew resistance gene mlo coding for a membrane-anchored protein  <cit> .

a common feature among the nlr, abc and start proteins described above is the presence of distinct domains within each family. in the nlr group, a large number of potential r-genes or resistance gene analog  encode r-proteins or effector-recognition receptors known as intracellular immune receptors and most belong to nucleotide-binding site-lrr  class  <cit>  including seven domains or motifs: toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor , coiled-coil , leucine zipper , nbs, lrr, tm and serinethreonine kinase   <cit> . in the abc group, the only well-characterized gene  encodes a full-size atp-binding cassette  transporter and this protein is a member of the abcg subfamily which is also known as the pdr  subfamily  <cit>  and this protein impedes the invasion and spread of compatible pathogens in wheat and other cereals  <cit> . the functions of lr <dig> are constitutive rather than induced because the gene functions irrespective of whether or not pathogens are present. there is no known lr gene that is yet available in the start group. yr <dig> is the only rust resistance gene in the group that is currently known to confer resistance to a broad spectrum of stripe rust races in wheat and this adult resistance is highly expressed at high temperatures   <cit> . in general, the start genes are not well studied but they are known to encode proteins for many functions in plants. the first function of the start proteins is, of course, the resistance to plant pathogens . the second function is the response to abiotic stresses, e.g., increased expression of transmembrane start  genes in chickpea in response to drought, salt, wound and heat stresses  <cit> . the third function is the ability to modulate transcription factor activity in arabidopsis  <cit> .

rna-seq is a more accurate method of quantifying gene expression levels than previous expression assay techniques such as microarray  <cit> . as rna-seq works without need for a genome sequence, it enables joint assays of host and pathogen transcriptomes, thereby gaining insights into how pathogens regulate the expression of their genes for disease progression and how they influence the host plant’s circuitry during a defense response . a recent study  <cit>  reported a detailed rna-seq time-course for a susceptible wheat cultivar  and a resistant line  inoculated with the wheat yellow rust pathogen puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici  at different days post-inoculation . these authors were able to identify clusters of differentially expressed genes in wheat plants and pst. for example, they identified a total of seven clusters of genes with similar expression profiles that were enriched in go  term annotations and kegg  pathway memberships for the wheat host. in particular, their cluster iii of host genes had a peak expression at  <dig> dpi and those genes for membrane transport and abc transporters and chitinases in this cluster were significantly enriched. thus, it would be desired to identify the expression profiles of the host genes that belong to the abc, nlr and start gene families.

recent qtl mapping studies have reported several hundred qtls for rust resistance in wheat populations . additionally, novel qtls associated with wheat rust resistance have been reported in several genome-wide association studies  , using the 9 k or 90 k single nucleotide polymorphism  chips  <cit> . most of the qtls for leaf rust resistance at the seedling and adult stages are now stored in the t <dig> database  <cit> . however, little is known about the physical relationships between these qtls and the abc, nlr and start genes. for example, it may be expected  <cit>  that the abc  genes are more likely to share genomic regions with qtls for race-nonspecific adult resistance whereas the nlr genes are more likely to share genomic regions with qtls for race-specific resistance that is readily expressed in the seedlings. the objective of this study is to conduct bioinformatic prediction and gene annotation within abc, nlr and start gene families in wheat that share genomic regions with qtls for leaf rust resistance at the seedling and adult stages as obtained from the t <dig> database  <cit> . specifically, we first predicted the putative abc, nlr and start genes across the wheat genome. then we attempted to establish physical relationships between these putative genes and the designated lr genes from the sequences of snp markers flanking the leaf rust qtls. together, this work provides an important framework for future studies to discover molecular functions of existing and new rust resistance genes in the wheat gene pool for their deployment in the development of wheat cultivars with improved rust resistance.

RESULTS
putative abc, nlr and start proteins in wheat
in total, we predicted  <dig> abc genes in the wheat genome. these abc proteins were classified into eight subfamilies with the subfamily g further divided into gwbc and gpdr . our results show that the g , c, b and i subfamilies in wheat are the four largest in the abc family, accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total  <dig> abc genes, respectively. notably,  <dig> abc gpdr transporters were predicted in the wheat genome, slightly more than a previous estimate of  <dig> full-size abcg transporters estimated from the full-size abcg gene numbers in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . in comparison, we also performed a parallel analysis in arabidopsis to validate the prediction pipeline. our result showed that, of  <dig> abc proteins found in arabidopsis g , b , i , c  were the four largest subfamilies, which is consistent with the arabidopsis result on the abc proteins recently reported by andolfo et al.  <cit> . these authors also reported  <dig> abc proteins in rice  <cit> , including  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in a, b, c, d, e, f, gwbc, gpdr and i families, respectively.table  <dig> numbers of abc, nlr and start family proteins and their subfamily classes over three wheat genomes  and chi-squared tests for even distributions across the genomes

for the nlr family, we predicted  <dig> nlr proteins in wheat . this number is slightly higher than those in previous studies of the genome-wide analysis of nlr-coding genes in wheat  <cit>  but slightly lower than the  <dig> nlr proteins predicted using the new gene models in the wheat genome assembly recently generated by earlham institute  <cit> . in a concurrent analysis, we predicted  <dig> nlr proteins in arabidopsis and the majority of them were tnl , accounting for nearly 69% , compared to less than 21%  of cnl  proteins. this high tnl/cnl ratio was consistent with previous studies of the nlr proteins in dicot species  <cit> . in contrast, nearly 88%  of the wheat nlr proteins were classified to the cnl class. however, nine  wheat tnl proteins were detected using nlr-parser, contrary to the commonly accepted belief that tnl genes might have been lost completely in monocots  <cit> . these nine proteins were further analyzed with pfamscan  <cit>  and the analysis indicated that none of them contains a predicted tir domain , the analysis also showed that eight of them contain a truncated nb-arc domain  whose length ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids  and the remaining one  was annotated by pfamscan as a ceramidase family protein. thus, this limited number of tnl proteins predicted in wheat is likely due to nlr-parser annotation error arising from the presence of truncated nb-arc domains. in addition,  <dig> % in arabidopsis and  <dig> % in wheat of the nlr proteins could not be classified to either cnl or tnl, which were designated as ‘n/a’ by nlr-parser.

the start family genes were predicted exclusively based on the presence of start  and/or start-like domain  following domain analysis of the wheat proteome using interproscan  <cit> . from this analysis, we detected  <dig> and  <dig> start genes in arabidopsis and wheat, respectively. among the five classes, the start class was the largest in both arabidopsis and wheat, with  <dig>  in the former and  <dig>  in the latter. hd-start was the second largest class in arabidopsis with  <dig> members , whereas minimal-start was the second largest class in wheat with  <dig> members . in both species, hd-start-mekhla was the smallest, each with seven members accounting for  <dig> % in arabidopsis and  <dig> % in wheat. in an early study, only  <dig> arabidopsis start genes were reported  <cit> , but these authors used only five start-domain proteins  as queries for blast searches. recently, satheeth and colleagues  <cit>  reported  <dig> start genes in chickpea , using the start domain  encoded by the arabidopsis gene at5g <dig>  as query sequence in the tblastn search against the genome contigs database of chickpea. to the best of our knowledge, no genome-scale analysis of start proteins has been reported in wheat.

our prediction was primarily based on domain analysis, with their domains summarized in additional file  <dig>  however, our classification of the putative abc proteins in wheat into different subfamilies was based on protein sequence homology to the abcs in arabidopsis and rice . therefore, we analyzed sequence similarity of abc proteins and their two main types of domains  between wheat, arabidopsis and rice . the protein sequence identity was higher between wheat and rice than between wheat and arabidopsis. on average, these entire abc proteins shared  <dig> % sequence identity  between wheat and arabidopsis, and  <dig> %  between wheat and rice . as expected, the abc domains showed greater homology in both wheat-arabidopsis and wheat-rice comparisons, especially for the nbds including abc transporter-like domain , aaa+ atpase domain  and p-loop ntpase fold . for instance, the abc transporter type  <dig> transmembrane domain  had an average sequence identity of  <dig> % between wheat and arabidopsis, and  <dig> % between wheat and rice . likewise, the average identity of the abc- <dig> transporter domain  was  <dig> % between wheat and arabidopsis, and  <dig> % between wheat and rice . for the abc transporter-like domain  the average identity increased to  <dig> % between wheat and arabidopsis, and  <dig> % between wheat and rice . the homology of the aaa+ atpase domain  was even higher between these species, with the average identity reaching  <dig> % between wheat and arabidopsis and  <dig> % between wheat and rice . lastly, the p-loop ntpase fold  showed slightly lower homology, with an average idenitity of  <dig> % between wheat and arabidopsis and  <dig> % between wheat and rice . although the sequence identity between wheat and rice abc proteins is mostly higher than between wheat and arabidopsis, the top hit of some wheat abc proteins was from arabidopsis. thus, we used both arabidopsis and rice abcs to classfiy the wheat abc proteins.fig.  <dig> the sequence percent identity between wheat abc proteins and their critical domains and those in arabidopsis and oryza sativa . a: entire abc protein sequences; b: abc transporter type  <dig> transmembrane domain ; c: abc- <dig> transporter domain ; d: abc transporter-like ; e: aaa+ atpase domain ; f: p-loop ntpase fold . red: wheat-arabidopsis comparison; green: wheat-rice comparsion; grey green: overlapping tails of the two comparisons. the average sequence identity , standard deviation  and number of comparisons  are indicated in the two text boxes: wheat-arabidopsis at the left side and wheat-rice comparison at the right side




annotation of the wheat abc, nlr and start genes
as almost all abc, nlr and start genes have no informative annotation  in the ensembl plants database  <cit> , we enhanced their annotation using sequence analysis with blast  <cit> . we first performed blast searches against the known plant disease resistance genes in genbank and prgdb  <cit> . though  <dig> abc proteins showed various degrees of sequence similarity to the known lr <dig> protein, only two had more than 97% identity , suggesting that the respective lr <dig> and lr34-b genes are traes_7ds_25b02ba <dig> and traes_4al_603b6dc <dig> in ensembl. traes_7ds_25b02ba <dig> is partial, encoding only  <dig> amino acids  instead of  <dig> aa for the full-length lr <dig> . in the ensembl release  <dig>  we found the full-length lr <dig> gene  encoding a protein of  <dig> aa. our annotation of lr <dig> and lr34-b was confirmed by multiple sequence alignment  of the lr <dig> and lr34-b proteins in ensembl as well as the known resistant  and susceptible  lr <dig> proteins in genbank . interestingly, this msa indicated that the putative lr <dig> proteins in ensembl  represent the resistant version of lr <dig>  in addition, the putative lr34-b  protein has about 97% sequence identity with lr <dig> , consistent with a previous study  <cit> . in contrast, in the nlr and start families, no genes showed over 90% sequence identity with known rust related proteins, and thus unlikely to represent the same genes. for example, traes_1ds_5ff8d9e2d in the nlr family exhibited an identity of ~85% with the known stripe rust resistance protein yr <dig> in genbank . in the start family, only the sequence of a kinase-start domain protein from t. dicoccoides was found in genbank , and the highest identity was ~63% at the protein sequence level with traes_7dl_a330c0f <dig> . the relative low sequence identity may be attributed to  the use of chinese spring  for genome sequencing and different wheat cultivars for gene isolation and  increased allelic diversity of r genes among the wheat accessions. for example, lr <dig> was cloned from glenlea  <cit>  and lr <dig> from thatcherlr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, it is reasonable to expect that when the same wheat genotype is used for both genome sequencing and gene cloning perfect sequence matching may be found. the only example we have found so far for this case is lr <dig> whose sequencing and cloning was based on cs  <cit>  and its protein sequence showed 100% identity with putative lr <dig> we annotated in this study .fig.  <dig> protein sequence alignment of the resistant and susceptible lr34-d in genbank and putative lr34-d and lr34-b in ensembl. acn41354: resistance version of genbank lr34-d; adk62371: susceptibility version of genbank lr34-d; traes_7ds_25b02ba46: lr34-d in ensembl release  <dig> ; triae_cs42_7ds_tgacv1_621754_aa2025300: lr34-d in the ensembl release  <dig> . traes_4al_603b6dc64: lr34-b in ensembl release  <dig>  the protein length is shown after the slash  of each identifier. arrows indicate the deletion of the phenylalanine residue  on position  <dig> and tyrosine  substitution to histidine  on position  <dig> in lr34res-d. the beginning and ending regions of the sequence alignment were removed for clarity




since numerous arabidopsis genes have been characterized, especially for the abc family, of which the major functions were largely known  , we then annotated these genes based on their best hit in the arabidopsis genome . for example, the putative lr <dig> in ensmebl was annotated as atpdr <dig> . similarly, lr34-b  was annotated as atpdr <dig> . thus, this annotation can be used to help select candidate genes for molecular characterization in wheat by leveraging the knowledge in the model plant.

distribution of abc, nlr and start genes in the three genomes of wheat and their physical proximity to snps of qtls for leaf rust resistance
of the abc genes we predicted in this study,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are from the a, b, and d genomes, respectively . for nlr genes,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are from a, b and d genomes respectively. for the start family:  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  are from a, b and d genomes respectively. the abc, nlr and start genes were evenly distributed over the three wheat genomes , judging from insignificant chi-squared  tests for individual subfamily classes.

from the two data sets each with  <dig> leaf rust resistance qtls being downloaded from the t <dig> database  <cit> , we retained  <dig> and  <dig> significant  qtls for seedling and adult resistance, respectively. in these two data sets, a total of  <dig> unique snp markers were used , and  <dig> of them are present in the qtls of both seedlings and adult plants . because a total of  <dig> snps for seedling and adult resistance  have unknown  chromosomes , we mapped their flanking sequences to the wheat genome to determine if these snps are located within the abc, nlr and start genes analyzed in this study or their neighboring regions .

the predicted abc, nlr and start genes and the snps for seedling and adult resistance that reside within coding or neighboring  regions of the predicted genes were mapped onto individual chromosomes in each of the three wheat genomes  . the designated lr genes previously mapped on each chromosome are also shown in the outer layer in fig.  <dig> to indicate their physical affinity with the candidate genes and snps for leaf rust resistance. unfortunately such affinity is very coarse due to the lack of mapping positions of the lr genes on individual chromosomes. some of the candidate genes with leaf rust snps only have positions on a scaffold , and thus could not be depicted in fig.  <dig> . for this reason, we divided these snps into two categories: the genes with chromosome positions  and the genes with scaffold positions . the numbers of snps for seedling and adult resistance residing in coding regions of abc, nlr and start genes or their neighborhood  showed different patterns . for example, we found  <dig> snps in genic or neighboring regions of the abc genes in seedlings and  <dig> in adult plants. conversely,  <dig> and  <dig> snps for seedling and adult resistance were found in genic or neighboring regions of the nlr genes, respectively. in contrast, the start genes or their neighborhood contain roughly identical numbers of qtl snps for both seedlings and adult resistance.fig.  <dig> distribution of abc, nlr and start genes and snp markers for leaf rust resistance in the a, b and d genomes of the hexaploid wheat genome. the circles were arranged according to the size of each family: inner, middle and outer circles for start, abc and nlr genes. a: seedling a genome; b: adult a genome; c: seedling b genome d: adult b genome; e: seedling d genome; f: adult d genome. red △ denotes markers within a gene; blue □ denotes markers  <dig> kb upstream  or downstream  of a gene. seven snps overlapped because of their close physical proximity on the same chromosome, see additional file  <dig> for details. we do not show designated leaf rust  genes on the chromosome maps for seedling resistance and adult plant resistance, which are listed as follows: 1a: lr59; 2a: lr <dig>  lr17a, lr17b, lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr49; 3a: lr63; 4a: lr28; 5a: -; 6a: lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr64; 7a: lr <dig>  lr47; 1b: lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr55; 2b: lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr58; 3b: lr27; 4b: lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr48; 5b: lr <dig>  lr52; 6b: lr3a, lr3bg, lr3ka, lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr61; 7b: lr14a, lr14b; 1d: lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr60; 2d: lr2a, lr2b, lr2c, lr <dig>  lr22a, lr22b, lr <dig>  lr54; 3d: lr <dig>  lr32; 4d: -; 5d: lr <dig>  lr57; 6d: -; 7d: lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr34

abc, nlr and start genes linked to non-snp molecular markers of rust resistance
the primer sequences of  <dig> non-snp molecular markers linked to designated rust genes were used to identify corresponding candidate abc, nlr and start genes in wheat. in total, we found  <dig> combinations of rust and ensembl genes located near these markers, with the median physical distance of about  <dig>  mb . of these, eight genes are located less than  <dig> kb away from the rust-associated markers, including two, five and one gene in the abc, nlr and start family, respectively . for example, we found the gwm <dig> marker is only 293 bp to traes_4al_7afba <dig>  this gene might therefore be srnd <dig>  a temporarily designated stem rust gene conferring resistance to several ug <dig> races of pgt  <cit> . in addition, lr <dig>  on 7ds was associated with traes_7ds_25b02ba <dig>  with a distance of 1212 bp to cssfr <dig> and 2189 bp to cssfr <dig>  two known markers for lr <dig>  <cit> . along with fig.  <dig> , this result further supports the annotation of traes_7ds_25b02ba <dig> as lr <dig>  demonstrating the usefulness of bioinformatics analyses in the discovery of rust resistance genes for functional characterization.table  <dig> candidate genes less than  <dig> kb to rust resistance markers for designated rust genes in the abc, nlr and start families

gene expression
the expression differences of the putative abc, nlr and start genes at different time points of infection  in resistant and susceptible wheat plants are presented in additional file  <dig>  our analysis revealed that the expression levels of the nlr genes for both resistant and susceptible plants were close to zero across all time points with the resistant plants being expressed only slightly more that the susceptible plants at comparable dpi . in contrast, we observed higher levels of gene expression in the resistant wheat plants than in susceptible for abc and start genes at early stages of infections  but susceptible plants had the similar amount of expression at the later stage . this is consistent with the finding in fig.  <dig> of dobon et al.  <cit>  in which seven clusters of host genes were identified and one cluster  including the genes encoding abc transporters had a peak expression at  <dig> dpi.fig.  <dig> rna-seq expression profiles of abc, nlr and start genes in resistant  wheat line  and susceptible  wheat cultivar  inoculated with yellow rust pathogen puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici  during  <dig> and 11 days post inoculation, respectively. abbreviations: dpi, days post inoculation; tpm, number of transcripts per million reads; r_abc, abc gene expression in resistant wheat; r_nlr, nlr gene expression in resistant wheat; r_start, start gene expression in resistant wheat; s_abc, abc gene expression in susceptible wheat; s_nlr, nlr gene expression in susceptible wheat; s_start, start gene expression in susceptible wheat




however, this result needs to be interpreted with care. resistant and susceptible plants may have very different genetic backgrounds  because they are different cultivars but not isogenic lines. similar gene expression analyses were performed in the wheat cultivars thatcher  and its near-isogenic line  carrying a leaf rust resistance gene lr <dig>  or lr <dig>    <cit> , but both using an est  based approach. these analyses showed some genes were expressed at higher levels in the resistant cultivar, including an abc transporter gene, while several nlr genes were expressed in both the susceptible and resistant samples infected with ptr. additionally, gene expression changes induced by the rust resistance gene lr34/yr <dig> were reported in the wheat nils using affymetrix wheat genechip microarray  <cit> , which identified both upregulated and downregulated genes associated with resistance.

discussion
the present study employed a domain analysis of wheat proteome to predict a total of  <dig> genes, with  <dig> coding for abc proteins,  <dig> for nlr proteins and  <dig> for start proteins over the three wheat genomes  . we were able to identify a number of snps that reside within protein-coding regions and cause amino acid changes of the predicted abc, nlr and start genes or their neighborhood . a total of  <dig> such snps were identified as the markers of qtls for leaf rust resistance at the seedling stage and another  <dig> snps as the markers of qtls for leaf rust resistance at the adult stage . the number of adult-resistance snps residing in the abc genes or their neighborhood at the adult stage was more than doubled the number of seedling-resistance snps whereas the reverse pattern was observed for the snp variants associated with the nlr genes . this seems consistent with the expectation  <cit>  that the qtls for race-nonspecific, adult rust resistance are more likely to share genomic regions with the candidate genes in the abc  family whereas those for race-specific rust resistance in the seedlings are more likely to share genomic regions with the candidate genes in the nlr family.

this study represents a major step towards classification of the candidate genes for race-specific and race-nonspecific resistance in the three gene families and their chromosome-wise physical affinity with snps  for leaf rust resistance in wheat. such information will be valuable for further characterizing qtls at molecular level and their functional relationships with the abc, nlr and start genes. we were already able to document our predicted amino acid changes due to alternation of single snps  in the coding regions of the abc, nlr and start genes . our analysis was motivated by recent reports that changes in two amino acids caused the difference in proteins encoded by the resistance and susceptibility alleles of lr <dig>  <cit>  and lr <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, our prediction based on point mutation must be treated as a preliminary result as structural variations such as copy number variation  of resistance genes may possess a more dramatic impact on disease and other biotic stress  <cit> . further complication arises from temporal variation among expressions of the putative abc, nlr and start genes in compatible  and incompatible  wheat-rust interactions as evident in our rna-seq analysis . thus, the predictions based on point mutation such as ours can only serve as a starting point towards more thorough molecular and functional characterization of resistance genes for their eventual cloning.

our prediction indicates that the number of race-specific nlr genes  is almost doubled the number of race-nonspecific genes . this seems consistent with the phenomenon that the majority of lr genes identified so far in wheat are effective against single races of lest rust only. as krattinger et al.  <cit>  pointed out, this phenomenon is also true for resistances to other diseases in wheat and other cereals. the problem with the use of such race-specific lr genes deployed in the wheat cultivars is that they have quickly become ineffective when new, more virulent races appear in leaf rust pathogen  <cit> . for this reason, wheat breeders and pathologists have focused on discovery, characterization and use of race-nonspecific genes for durable resistance. however, decades of genetic and breeding research have only been able to identify a limited number of genes in wheat with durable and broad-spectrum resistance to rusts including lr34/yr18/sr57/pm <dig>  lr46/yr29/pm <dig>  lr67/yr46/sr55/pm <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  and yr <dig>  <cit> . thus far, lr34/yr18/sr57/pm <dig>  is the most well-characterized multi-pathogen resistance gene located on wheat chromosome 7d  <cit> . unfortunately we did not find any known snps for the leaf rust resistance in the t <dig> data sets  <cit>  that would reside within coding regions of the lr <dig> gene or its neighborhood within  <dig> kb upstream and downstream. certainly, the wheat 9 k and 90 k snp chips are hardly sufficient to cover large, complex wheat genomes, particularly the d genome . with ongoing international efforts on manifold sequencing of wheat genomes, exact physical positions and functions of those snp variants within the abc genes  will be further clarified and characterized.

it may be questioned why lr67/yr46/sr55/pm <dig>  was not included in this study as it is another well-characterized race-nonspecific gene at the molecular level just like lr <dig>  the reason is that it does not encode an abc transporter, but rather it encodes a hexose transporter and confers a similar, but somewhat reduced partial resistance to all three wheat rust pathogens and powdery mildew  <cit> . like in lr <dig>  only two amino acid substitutions  distinguish the resistance  from susceptibility  protein  <cit> . the hexose transport activity of lr <dig> has been demonstrated in a yeast  mutant lacking the glucose uptake ability  <cit> . a preliminary analysis of five protein sequences encoded by lr <dig>  <cit>  including three homoeologs  and the resistance/susceptibility versions from genbank  showed that none of them exhibited a high level of homology to the three family proteins  analyzed in this study . since lr <dig> belongs to the sugar transporter protein  family, a genome-wide search of the stp proteins using the major facilitator, sugar transport domain , allowed for discovering  <dig> stp proteins  in wheat. this stp data set along with the abc and other possible transporter families can be further examined in future studies for their physical relationships with qtls for partial, adult resistance to multiple pathogens in wheat and other cereals.

this study has focused on annotating and characterizing the physical relationships between abc, nlr and start genes and qtls for resistance to leaf rust. similar efforts can be made for stem and stripe  rusts. at the time of completion of this work as of february  <dig>  there is only a limited amount of qtl data available for stem and stripe rust resistance from the t <dig> database  <cit>  that can be used for such annotation and characterization; in particular, imbalanced availability of qtls for seedling and adult resistance makes a valid comparative assessment more difficult. as more qtl data become available for stem and stripe rusts, it is conceivable that a similar pattern of the physical relationships between the gene families and qtls will be identified, just like what we observed in leaf rust.

our sequence analyses were greatly affected by the fragmentary status of the draft wheat genome assembly  <cit> . in the ensembl release  <dig> of the wheat genome used in this study, the  <dig> wheat chromosomes were represented by a total of  <dig>  assembled scaffold sequences. the average scaffold length was about  <dig>  bp , with the median of 3800 bp and maximum of  <dig> ,471 bp. because of similar concerns about assembly quality, we chose not to use ensembl release  <dig> , which incorporated short rna-seq reads and full-length cdna sequences  <cit>  but seems more fragmented than release  <dig> according to our assessment. for example, the wheat genome assembly in release  <dig> consists of  <dig>  supercontig sequences , with an average supercontig length of  <dig>  bp , median of 2431 bp and maximum of  <dig>  bp. the fragmentary assembly of the wheat genome might also have affected our blast searches using the primer sequences against the wheat genomic sequences, and this may be the primary reason of why only seven abc, nlr and start genes were identified within 100kb to the markers of qtls for rust resistance . other studies based on similar fragmentary assemblies were not even able to identify candidate genes but rather some genomic regions for disease resistance and other agronomic traits. two such studies are:  an in silico mapping of dart marker sequences for identification of genomic regions harboring resistance to the three rusts  <cit>  and  flanking sequences of the snps of the wheat 90 k chip for identification of candidate genes and regions for pre-harvest sprouting  resistance in wheat  <cit> , but with the candidate genes being inferred from brachypodium  and rice genomes via comparative mapping.

in addition to the abc, nlr and start genes analyzed in this study, genes in other families may also be involved in rust resistance. we have already mentioned genes within the stp transporter family like lr <dig>  additional genes include those encoding unusual kinases, receptor-like kinases  and receptor-like proteins   <cit> , and genes involving cell wall biosynthesis and metabolism, such as cysteine proteinase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, plasma membrane atpase and chalcone synthase  <cit> . when a pathogen attacks its host, the first line of host defense is through secretion of cell surface pattern-recognition receptors  and such defense-induced proteins may be recognized and overcome by specific pathogen effectors. the majority of characterized prrs are either rlks or rlps . a recently developed tool called rgaugury  <cit>  focused on classification of these proteins and nlr protein family. however, our study had a different focus on the three major protein families related to leaf rust resistance in wheat and these families contain different domains suitable for large-scale analyses.

certainly with ongoing international efforts for more in-depth wheat genome sequencing, the candidate genes we identified for each of the three gene families eventually will be physically mapped at accurate locations on individual chromosomes. in other words, fig.  <dig> will be significantly clarified and updated. such updating will enable wheat breeders and pathologists to use the well-characterized abc, nlr and start genes for molecular characterization of the designated lr genes in breeding for rust resistances. while abc and start genes may be preferably used as reasoned above, their resistance is only partial and insufficient under high disease pressure when used alone. strong, durable resistance has been achieved by combining these race-nonspecific genes with race-specific nlr genes such as ‘sr2-complex’  <cit> . however, little is known about the other combining genes and their interactions in the complex. thus, it would be desirable that future studies will investigate how race-nonspecific genes in the abc or start gene family interact with weak and strong r genes in the nlr gene family at the molecular level using the candidate genes we identified and characterized for the three gene families.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we predicted the putative abc, nlr and start genes in the hexaploid wheat genome, and performed an integrated analysis with the available genetic resources related to rust resistance, including mapped lr genes, snps and other molecular markers. our analysis suggests that the abc  genes are more likely to share genomic regions with qtls for race-nonspecific, adult resistance whereas the nlr genes are more likely to share genomic regions with qtls for race-specific resistance that would be often expressed at the seedling stage. candidate genes such as those containing one or multiple missense coding snps can be tested in future studies. with continuing efforts for producing an improved assembly and annotation of the wheat genome, bioinformatics analyses such as ours can help identify novel genes for rust resistance breeding in wheat.
