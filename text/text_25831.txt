BACKGROUND
seed maturation begins during mid-embryogenesis and controls important traits, including seed quality and viability. in arabidopsis, during mid-embryogenesis the embryo accumulates storage compounds, such as seed storage proteins  and lipids, which are broken down during the first days of germination to sustain the growing seedling. as development progresses into late embryogenesis a variety of protective proteins, including late embryogenesis abundant proteins  and heat shock proteins , are synthesized to prepare the embryo for desiccation and the final stage of dormancy  <cit> . genetic and molecular studies have shown that seed maturation is orchestrated by the hormone abscisic acid  and a network of transcription factors, which include the leafy cotyledon <dig>  ccaat binding factor and the b3-domain transcription factors, lec <dig>  fusca <dig>  and abscisic acid insensitive <dig>   <cit> . these genes are considered global regulators of seed maturation, as loss-of-function mutant embryos skip late-embryonic development and enter the vegetative program prematurely. as a consequence, immature mutant seeds are less dormant, can germinate precociously and accumulate less seed storage compounds. furthermore, seeds of fus <dig>  abi <dig> and lec <dig> mutants are also desiccation intolerant and become inviable when dry  <cit> . enhancement of these phenotypes shown in higher order mutants, and in transcriptional regulatory studies, demonstrates that these genes act in concert to control seed maturation, dormancy and desiccation tolerance  <cit> . the important role of aba in regulating seed maturation and dormancy is exemplified by genetic and chemical studies, which show that a reduction of aba level also decreases seed dormancy  <cit> . further studies have shown that b3-domain transcription factors are important nodes in hormone signaling pathways and control important steps in hormone biosynthesis. for example, fus <dig> promotes dormancy and prevents precocious germination of immature seeds, by stimulating aba synthesis while repressing ga biosynthesis  <cit> . in a feedback regulation, aba and ga respectively stabilize and destabilize the fus <dig> protein through a mechanism involving the c-terminal region of fus <dig>  <cit> . in addition to its role in seed development, abi <dig> is a positive regulator of aba signaling, as abi <dig> seeds are strongly insensitive to aba during germination  <cit> . aba sensitivity is not affected in fus <dig>  lec <dig> and lec <dig>  suggesting that aba sensitivity and seed maturation can be uncoupled  <cit> . the b3-domain proteins are also involved in auxin sensitivity and biosynthesis. the promoters of fus <dig> and abi <dig> are induced by auxin, while auxin biosynthetic genes are positively regulated by lec <dig> and fus <dig>  <cit> .

the b3-domain binds the sph/ry  core element found in the promoter of many seed-specific genes and some of the b3-domain targets include lea and em  <cit> . these genes are also under the control of aba  <cit> . ry/sph elements have been shown to act synergistically with aba response elements , suggesting that a complex interaction of seed-specific and aba-regulated factors controls late embryogenesis and seed maturation  <cit> . heat shock factors  and hsps, which are rapidly induced during heat stress  and highly abundant in seeds, are also b3-domain and aba targets. in particular, the expression of the seed specific hsfa <dig> is induced by abi <dig> through the sph/ry in an aba-dependent manner. activation of hsfa <dig>  in turn, regulates the expression of select hs genes  <cit> .

transcript levels of the lec, fus <dig> and abi <dig> genes are abundant during embryogenesis, decrease during germination, and are expressed at low levels in vegetative organs  <cit> . repression of these genes during germination is required to enter vegetative development, as overexpression of fus <dig> and the lec post-embryonically results in the expression of embryonic markers and the development of embryonic structures during vegetative growth  <cit> . more specifically, overexpression of fus <dig>  results in delayed seed germination and hypersensitivity to aba. since one of the roles of dormancy is to stagger germination and prevent mass growth under suboptimal conditions, we tested whether during imbibition under abiotic stress fus <dig> would be re-activated to delay germination. among the stresses tested in this study, we found that high temperature induces de novo fus <dig> mrna synthesis and protein accumulation in imbibed seeds. in contrast to wt, ml1:fus3-gfp seeds overexpressing fus <dig> during germination are hypersensitive to supraoptimal  temperature and fail to germinate. inhibition of ml1:fus3-gfp germination at supraoptimal temperature is partly dependent on aba biosynthesis and is a reversible process, as ml1:fus3-gfp seeds imbibed at high temperature for six days can resume germination when the temperature becomes optimal for growth. transcriptomic analysis shows that seeds exposed to supraoptimal temperature re-activate the expression of late embryonic and seed maturation programs, while inhibiting germination-promoting programs, to delay seed germination at supraoptimal temperatures.

RESULTS
germination at supraoptimal temperature activates the fus <dig> promoter and induces fus <dig> mrna and protein accumulation
to test whether fus <dig> plays a role during germination under abiotic stresses, we measured fus <dig> mrna levels in wt seeds imbibed on high salt , during osmotic stress  and at low  and high  temperatures . these conditions have been previously shown to delay wt seed germination  <cit> . we screened for changes in patterns of fus <dig> expression at early  and late  stages of seed imbibition, since fus <dig> transcript level rapidly decreases during germination  <cit> . fus <dig> mrna level is only slightly affected on  <dig> mm nacl and fluctuates in expression on  <dig> mm mannitol and at 12°c. in contrast, fus <dig> mrna level increases 2- <dig> fold in seeds imbibed at 32°c for  <dig> h and  <dig> h, therefore, we investigated the role of fus <dig> during seed germination at high temperature in more detail.

we performed a more detailed time-course experiment and monitored fus <dig> expression level in seeds imbibed at 32°c for up to  <dig> days . we found that the level of fus <dig> mrna decreases faster during the first  <dig> h of hs, reaching a comparable level to the control at  <dig> h. thereafter, the mrna starts increasing and remains higher than the control for at least  <dig> days . to test whether the increase in fus <dig> mrna after longer hs exposure was due to an activation of the fus <dig> promoter or an increase in fus <dig> mrna stability, we used the fus3:gfp transcriptional reporter previously described   <cit> . compared to the 21°c control, there is a marked increase in gfp fluorescence at 32°c between  <dig> and  <dig> h, which reflects an increase in fus <dig> promoter activity. thus, the exposure of seeds to high temperatures induces rapid degradation of fus <dig> mrna within the first  <dig> h, followed by transcriptional activation  leading to new mrna synthesis from  <dig> h. these findings are mirrored by an increase in fus <dig> protein level, measured by using the fus3:fus3-gfp  translational reporter previously described   <cit> . the fus3-gfp protein was detected in the nuclei of epidermal cells and on immunoblots of seeds imbibed at 32°c for  <dig> and  <dig> h . in agreement with previous studies, no fus3-gfp was detected in seeds imbibed at 21°c for up to  <dig> days   <cit> .

next, we tested whether the late accumulation of the fus3-gfp protein at 32°c was due to an increase in the seed aba/ga ratio, as arabidopsis seeds imbibed at high temperature repress ga biosynthesis and induce de novo aba synthesis resulting in a higher aba level at  <dig> h  <cit> . no fus3-gfp was detected in fus3:fus3-gfp seeds germinated on aba or paclobutrazol, a ga biosynthesis inhibitor, at 21°c, suggesting that fus <dig> accumulation at high temperature is not dependent solely on higher aba level . interestingly, the fus <dig> protein was detected only in seeds that have commenced germination , but not in thermoinhibited seeds  or seedlings that have germinated from the seed coat. this suggests that during germination at high temperature, fus <dig> may act in a small developmental window that precedes seedling emergence from the seed coat. together, these results indicate that imbibition at the supraoptimal temperature of 32°c induces an increase in fus <dig> transcript level at 12- <dig> h, which is followed by an increase in fus <dig> protein level at  <dig> h.

seed germination and seedling survival of wt and fus <dig> loss- and gain-of-function mutants imbibed at high temperature
to dissect the role of fus <dig> during germination at supraoptimal temperatures, we monitored the germination and survival rates of wt, fus <dig> loss-of-function  and overexpression  mutant seeds imbibed at 32°c . the ml1:fus3-gfp construct was previously shown to rescue the fus3- <dig> loss-of-function mutant and overexpress fus <dig> post-embryonically throughout vegetative and reproductive development  <cit> . at 21°c, mature wt seeds reach 100% germination within  <dig> days, while ml1:fus3-gfp seeds are more dormant and germinate slower reaching 90% germination in 5- <dig> days . despite reaching 60-100% germination within  <dig> days , mature wt seeds show delayed germination at 32°c . all grown seedlings manifest phenotypes associated with high temperature stress, including arrested growth and bleached cotyledons and hypocotyls . these seedlings do not recover and fail to grow even when transferred to 21°c, indicating that prolonged exposure to 32°c is lethal for arabidopsis seedling growth . in contrast, germination of mature ml1:fus3-gfp seeds was greatly reduced or inhibited  for up to  <dig> days at 32°c, suggesting ml1:fus3-gfp seeds are hypersensitive to high temperatures . although a very low percentage of seeds show radicle protrusion between  <dig> and  <dig> days, no seedling emerges from the seed coat . interestingly, all ml1:fus3-gfp seeds resumed germination when transferred to the control temperature and this results in a much greater ml1:fus3-gfp survival rate compared to the wt .

mature fus <dig> loss-of-function  mutant seeds are desiccation intolerant and inviable, but can be rescued if immature seeds are harvested when still green, prior to desiccation. therefore, we compared the germination rates of immature green seeds of fus3- <dig> and wt when imbibed under control and high temperature . at 21°c, immature wt seeds begin to germinate  <dig> days after imbibition and reach ~60% germination by  <dig> days. this is expected, as immature wt seeds are dormant. however, at 32°c, immature wt seeds show strong thermoinhibition and reach ~10% germination after  <dig> days. after transfer to 21°c, wt immature seeds resume germination. in contrast, immature fus3- <dig> seeds reach ~80% and ~60% germination by  <dig> days at 21°c and 32°c, respectively, and thus are strongly resistant to thermoinhibition. as expected, immature fus3- <dig> seeds, which have a higher percentage of germination than immature wt seeds at 32°c, showed lower seedling survival than wt after recovery at 21°c . in summary, this data indicates that overexpression of fus <dig> inhibits seed germination at supraoptimal temperature and this increases seedling survival when temperatures become optimal for growth. it also suggests that inhibition of germination at supraoptimal temperature is a reversible process and has a protective role for the embryo.

ml1:fus3-gfp hypersensitivity to high temperature during imbibition is dependent on aba biosynthesis
arabidopsis seeds imbibed at 34°c have higher aba/ga ratio due to the activation of aba and repression of ga biosyntheses, which results in thermoinhibition of seed germination  <cit> . ml1:fus3-gfp seeds are hypersensitive to aba during germination and transient activation of fus <dig> using an ml1:fus3-gr construct increases aba levels post-embryonically  <cit> . in light of this, we investigated whether ml1:fus3-gfp inhibition of germination at 32°c is due to altered aba biosynthesis. to test this, we germinated wt and ml1:fus3-gfp seeds in the presence of fluridone, an inhibitor of aba biosynthesis. fluridone can fully reverse the delay of wt germination at 32°c and partly recover the inhibition of ml1:fus3-gfp germination at 32°c . fluridone also increases the germination rate of ml1:fus3-gfp seeds at 21°c . this suggests that the delayed germination of ml1:fus3-gfp seeds at the control temperature, and inhibition at high temperature, appear to be partly dependent on de novo aba biosynthesis. furthermore, since seeds overexpressing fus <dig> are more dormant, partly due to increased aba biosynthesis, increased dormancy may have a positive effect during germination at supraoptimal temperatures.

in contrast, fluridone did not have any effect on the germination of immature fus3- <dig> and wt seeds at 32°c, and slightly increased the germination of wt seeds at 21°c . the insensitivity of fus3- <dig> seeds to fluridone was expected, as fus3- <dig> seeds have a lower aba level  <cit> . however, the lack of effect of fluridone on the germination of immature wt seeds was surprising. since immature wt seeds resume germination when plates are shifted to the optimal temperature, the lack of effect of fluridone on wt germination cannot be attributed to damage or death of the wt green seeds. this suggests that de novo aba synthesis may not have a predominant role in regulating the germination of wt immature seeds at high temperature .

transcriptomic analysis of seeds imbibed at high temperature
our data shows that seed germination at the supraoptimal temperature of 32°c induces de novo fus <dig> mrna synthesis and, most importantly, fus <dig> protein accumulation. furthermore, fus <dig> overexpression strongly inhibits arabidopsis germination partly through aba biosynthesis. since high temperature induces not only changes in aba/ga levels but also reactivates fus <dig> function in imbibed seeds, we predicted that high temperature would also activate seed maturation programs partly regulated by the b3-protein network to delay germination. furthermore, since fus <dig> controls the aba/ga ratio and since aba and ga have been shown to play important roles during thermoinhibition, we were interested in identifying hormonal networks working at the time fus <dig> is active. therefore, we characterized the transcriptomic response of wt seeds imbibed at high temperature. we conducted a time-course microarray  with wt arabidopsis seeds imbibed at optimal  or supraoptimal  temperatures for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. these time points were chosen to identify early  and late  heat-stress responsive  genes. the latter time points were also chosen because they correlate with an increase in aba level and fus <dig> expression, and thus may identify fus <dig> and aba coexpressed genes.

only a small set of  <dig> genes change in expression level after  <dig> h of heat treatment, while >  <dig> genes are differentially expressed at both  <dig> and  <dig> h, indicating a large transcriptional reprogramming at later stages of hs . while there is a relatively small overlap between early and late hsr genes, a large number of genes show increased  or decreased  expression at both  <dig> and  <dig> h. to determine the cellular responses to hs, we analyzed transcriptional changes using the gene ontology  enrichment analysis   <cit> . at all time points, the largest go-function categories being enriched are those comprising 'cellular and metabolic processes', while the most significant function being enriched is the 'response to stimulus' . after  <dig> h of exposure to 32°c the imbibed seed has limited response, and genes important for the 'response to high temperature' and 'protein folding' are among the most enriched in early hsrs . after  <dig> and  <dig> h of imbibition at 32°c, however, the cellular response of the seed becomes more complex. go-enrichment analysis suggests that the specificity of the hs response is strengthened by activating genes required for thermotolerance, adjusting cellular metabolism and inhibiting growth and development . while the most significant biological function enriched in late hsrs is again the 'response to stimulus', 'embryonic development' and 'seed dormancy' are also among the go-function categories significantly enriched . the most enriched 'stimuli' include abiotic  and chemical  stimuli.

stress-related and seed maturation genes are activated during seed imbibition at supraoptimal temperature
hsps and hsfs are well known for their protective role in cellular functions at high-temperature and are rapidly induced after hs, however, they also play a role in other stresses  <cit> . seven hsps and four hsfs increase in expression at  <dig> h, including hsfa <dig> and hsfa <dig>  which have been well characterized for their role in the acquisition of thermotolerance in seedlings   <cit> . a larger number of hsps  and hsfs  show an increase in transcript abundance at  <dig> h and/or  <dig> h, with a strong induction of the highly expressed hsfa <dig> and the proposed seed-specific and hs-independent, hsfa <dig>   <cit> . these late-induced hsf genes may be required for prolonged cellular responses to high temperature.

as expected, seeds imbibed at high temperature for  <dig> and  <dig> h show a large increase in the expression levels of late embryogenesis and seed maturation genes, including lea, ssps and storage lipids . together with molecular chaperones and other protective compounds, lea genes are thought to be involved in direct abiotic stress tolerance and are induced by several abiotic stresses  <cit> . ssp and storage lipids are typical markers of seed maturation and some have been shown to be regulated directly or indirectly by b3-domain proteins, including fus <dig>  <cit> . among the known global regulators of late embryogenesis and seed maturation, fus <dig> is the only gene induced by hs, suggesting that it may play an important role in the activation of seed-specific programs during imbibition at supraoptimal temperature . interestingly, transcript levels of three yet uncharacterized b3-containing proteins  are also induced at  <dig> h , and may play complementary roles with fus <dig> during imbibition at supraoptimal temperature.

prolonged hs activates aba and represses ga metabolic genes
genes involved in hormone metabolism and signaling, predominantly the hormones aba and ga, are enriched among the late hsr genes . genes regulating aba metabolic pathways show increased mrna levels, while transcript levels of ga biosynthesis genes are decreased . only a few known ga signaling genes were identified as hsr in our microarray, including the ga receptor, gid1a, and signaling components such as spy and sly. in contrast, several genes involved in aba signaling are differentially expressed at high temperature. these include several members of the aba receptor family , as well as other downstream signaling components such as pp2c phosphatases  and transcription factors  . more than  <dig> kinases have altered expression level during heat stress, including members of the snrk2/ <dig> families of serine/threonine kinases, which comprises positive regulators of aba signaling and abiotic stress responses   <cit> 
. most of these genes, including several pyl/rcars, pp2cs and snrk2/ <dig> kinases have uncharacterized functions. thus, transcriptomic analysis of seeds imbibed at high temperature suggests that select known aba signaling genes as well as uncharacterized members of the pyl/rcar, pp2c and snrk families are differentially regulated during germination at supraoptimal temperature and may play specific roles during thermoinhibition.

a number of genes coding for different families of transcription factors involved in other hormone or stress signaling pathways are also differentially regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h. transcript levels of the drought and heat-stress responsive dreb2a  <cit> , auxin  and ethylene  responsive genes are among some of those that fluctuate in expression level at  <dig> and/or  <dig> h . thus, other hormones beside aba and ga may play a role during germination at supraoptimal temperature.

core hsr genes
the transcript levels of  <dig> genes are increased or decreased at all three time points and constitute the core hsr genes . beside the constitutively and highly expressed hsfa <dig>  all other genes in this list have not been tested for their role during hs. interestingly, pdx <dig>  is highly expressed and is among the strongest hsr genes induced at  <dig> h. mutations in pdx <dig> genes affect pyridoxine  biosynthesis, however, the role of pdx <dig>  has not been clarified yet  <cit> . vitamin b <dig> is known to play a protective role against oxidative stress and it is a cofactor in many biochemical processes  <cit> . thus, vitamin b <dig> may be an important component in the response of seeds to high temperature.

discussion
seed germination is controlled by endogenous factors, such as the degree of dormancy, as well as environmental cues, including light, temperature and water. in arabidopsis, germination of wt seeds is delayed or moderately inhibited at temperatures between  <dig> and 32°c, but completely inhibited at 34°c  <cit> . physiological, genetic and molecular studies have highlighted the important and opposite roles of aba and ga in promoting and alleviating thermoinhibition of seed germination, respectively  <cit> . the master regulator of seed maturation, fus <dig>  controls the aba/ga ratio by negatively regulating ga biosynthesis, while positively regulating aba levels  <cit> . here, we show that one of the functions of fus <dig> during post-embryonic development is to regulate seed responses to high temperatures, by delaying seed germination and inhibiting seedling growth partly through the regulation of aba biosynthesis .

high temperature induces de novo fus <dig> mrna synthesis and fus <dig> protein accumulation during imbibition
fus <dig> plays a predominant role during mid-late embryogenesis by promoting seed dormancy and maturation, while inhibiting precocious germination of immature seeds  <cit> . accordingly, fus <dig> mrna level is high during mid-late embryogenesis and dramatically decreases during germination and throughout vegetative growth  <cit> . furthermore, the level of the fus <dig> protein does not correlate with that of its mrna and remains undetected after mid-embryogenesis  <cit> . given the very low level of fus <dig> expression post-embryonically, one question raised by these studies is the physiological role of fus <dig> during post-embryonic development. here we found that seeds imbibed at 32°c rapidly degrade fus <dig> mrna stored in the seed and induce de novo fus <dig> mrna synthesis at  <dig> h, which is then followed by the accumulation of the fus <dig> protein by  <dig> h . notably, the fus <dig> mrna levels at 32°c are ~ <dig> to 70-fold lower than those measured  <dig> h after imbibition at 21°c. despite the lower mrna level, the fus <dig> protein is detected in seeds imbibed at 32°c but not at 21°c. we have previously shown that fus <dig> is a short-lived protein and posttranslational regulation is one of the mechanisms that maintains fus <dig> protein levels very low  after mid-embryogenesis and during germination  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the accumulation of the fus3-gfp protein at 32°c is due to translational and/or posttranslational regulation induced by hs.

considering the fus3-gfp protein is not detected in fus3:fus3-gfp seeds imbibed on aba at 21°c , aba alone does not seem to be sufficient to induce fus3-gfp protein accumulation during imbibition at high temperature. however, aba may be required to maintain fus <dig> protein levels high by a positive feedback regulation, as aba was previously shown to positively regulate fus <dig> abundance in ml1:fus3-gfp seedlings   <cit> . interestingly, we found that at 32°c the fus <dig> protein can only be detected in seeds that have commenced germination  and is not detected in inhibited seeds  or in seedlings that have fully emerged from the seed coat. this indicates that fus <dig> is only active in a small developmental window during germination at high temperature and may be important to delay germination and inhibit seedling growth .

overexpression of fus <dig> inhibits seed germination at supraoptimal temperature partly through positive regulation of aba biosynthesis
overexpression of fus <dig> has a protective role for the embryo during germination at high temperature. indeed, at 32°c wt seeds show delayed germination compared to the optimal temperature of 21°c and suffer from heat-stress related damages. in contrast, seeds overexpressing fus <dig> post-embryonically  show a strong thermoinhibition and result in a much higher seedlings survival than wt when shifted at 21°c . thermoinhibition exhibited by ml1:fus3-gfp seeds at 32°c can be alleviated by the aba biosynthesis inhibitor, fluridone, suggesting it is dependent on de novo aba biosynthesis. furthermore, ml1:fus3-gfp seeds are more dormant than wt at 21°c and the delayed germination exhibited by ml1:fus3-gfp seeds at optimal temperature can also be rescued by fluridone. considering that transient activation of fus <dig> post-embryonically increases aba levels and that ml1:fus3-gfp seeds are hypersensitive to aba even at the optimal temperature of 21°c  <cit> , we conclude that seeds overexpressing fus <dig> are hypersensitive to high temperature and induces thermoinhibition through de novo activation of aba biosynthesis. these findings mirror previous findings showing that thermoinhibition of germination at 34°c is partly due to de novo aba biosynthesis and that loss-of-function mutants affected in aba biosynthesis show resistance to thermoinhibition  <cit> . thus, increased seed dormancy and/or aba biosynthesis is advantageous as it delays or prevents germination at high temperatures and protects the developing seedling from temperature-induced damage.

immature green seeds of the fus3- <dig> loss-of-function mutant, which accumulate less aba during embryogenesis, are less dormant than wt at 21°c   <cit> . accordingly, fus3- <dig> is more resistant than wt to thermoinhibition at 32°c. surprisingly, thermoinhibition of wt immature green seeds is not dependent on aba biosynthesis, as it cannot be rescued by fluridone. thus, it appears that different mechanisms may regulate immature and mature seed germination at supraoptimal temperature. in the future, the sensitivity of different stages of immature seeds should be assessed in order to determine the role of aba in thermoinhibition of immature seeds. indeed, two peaks of aba occur during seed development in arabidopsis and many species; the first maternally-derived aba peak is required to prevent precocious germination while the second aba peak is made by the embryo and important to induce and maintain dormancy  <cit> . thus, the response of immature seeds to fluridone may be dependent on the stage of development.

transcriptomic analysis of wt seeds imbibed at supraoptimal temperature
a transcriptomic analysis of seeds imbibed at 32°c shows differential expression of several genes involved in aba and ga metabolisms as well as signaling. among the aba biosynthetic genes, nced <dig>  nced <dig>  nced <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> showed increased expression at  <dig> and/or  <dig> h, while cyp707a <dig>  the most abundant aba catabolic gene during germination  <cit> , showed a transient reduction of expression at  <dig> h. these changes in gene expression are consistent with previous quantifications of transcript levels of several aba metabolic genes during imbibition at 34°c  <cit> . the increase in fus <dig> mrna level at  <dig> and  <dig> h parallels that of the aba biosynthetic genes. interestingly, all aba metabolic genes identified in this microarray with the exception of nced <dig> contain ry elements, which interact with b3-domain proteins  <cit> . since fus <dig> positively regulates aba levels, these genes may be directly regulated by fus <dig> and/or other b <dig> domain proteins.

genetic analysis indicates that aba biosynthesis and signaling are required for thermoinhibition of germination and also for the acquisition of thermotolerance during vegetative growth  <cit> . differences were observed in the degree of responses to high temperature of single or higher order aba biosynthetic mutants, with aba <dig> and the triple nced <dig> nced <dig> nced <dig> mutants being strongly resistant to thermoinhibition  <cit> . in agreement, aba <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig> show the highest increase in transcript level in our microarray .

aba insensitive  mutants affected in aba signaling display different sensitivities to high temperature; for example, abi <dig> is strongly resistant to thermoinhibition, while abi <dig> is moderately resistant and abi <dig>  abi <dig> and abi <dig> are sensitive to thermoinhibition  <cit> . several aba signaling components show altered expression during imbibition at high temperature , including several members of the aba receptor family  and downstream signaling and response genes   <cit> . the regulation and function of most of these genes during germination at high temperature has not been tested. together with the fact that not all aba signaling mutants tested so far are resistant to thermoinhibition, this suggests that different components of the aba pathway are used to delay or inhibit seed germination at high temperatures.

our transcriptomic analysis shows that the expression levels of several ga biosynthetic genes were reduced in response to high temperature. interestingly, ga3ox <dig>  ga3ox <dig> and ga20ox <dig>  which show the strongest and prolonged reduction in mrna levels, are under fus3-mediated repression  <cit> . genetic and chemical studies have shown that thermoinhibition of seed germination in arabidopsis requires the suppression of ga biosynthesis and signaling  <cit> . indeed, thermoinhibition can be partly alleviated by the addition of exogenous ga. furthermore, loss-of-function mutations in some negative regulators of ga signaling  confer resistance to thermoinhibition, while mutations in several others  do not  <cit> . analysis of multiple combinations of della mutants may be required to fully understand the role of ga signaling components in thermoinhibition. interestingly, our transcriptomic analysis shows that repression of ga signaling at high temperature starts with the transient downregulation of sly <dig> at  <dig> h and is followed by the upregulation of gid1a and spy at  <dig> h . thus, downregulating sly <dig>  which encodes an f-box protein involved in the degradation of multiple della proteins  <cit> , may be sufficient to dampen ga signaling during germination at high temperature. the induction at  <dig> h of gid1a, coding for the most abundant ga receptor in dry and imbibed seeds, is possibly due to a feedback regulation triggered by changes in the aba/ga ratio, as previously suggested  <cit> . the increase in gid1a level at  <dig> h may also counteract the effect of decreased sly <dig> mrna at this time point, since gid <dig> overexpression down-regulates della repression  <cit> . genetic analysis of sly and gid mutants is needed to dissect the role of ga in thermoinhibition of germination.

seed-specific and seed-maturation related genes are induced by high temperature at  <dig> and  <dig> h. a large number of these genes, which are among the highest expressed in dry seeds  <cit> , also show the highest abundance of transcripts in seeds imbibed at 32°c . a survey of public microarrays shows that most of the ssp/lea genes displaying highest mrna levels during seed imbibition at 32°c are preferentially expressed during seed development  <cit> . furthermore, most of the ssp/lea genes showing increased expression at 32°c, also show induction by aba in seeds or seedlings  <cit> . this suggests that at high temperature, the expression levels of ssp/lea genes may fluctuate in response to changes in aba level. this also corroborates the view that ssp/lea genes are strongly regulated by aba, but play different roles beyond seed maturation  <cit> . among the known global regulators of late embryogenesis, fus <dig> is the only gene induced by hs in our microarray, and thus may play a predominant role in the regulation of seed-specific programs during germination at high temperature . this was surprising, as abi <dig> mutants have been recovered in genetic screens for high-temperature resistant mutants  <cit> . the reduced sensitivity of abi <dig> to high temperature during germination is likely a consequence of the inability of this mutant to respond to aba. possibly, high temperature may affect translational and/or posttranslational regulation of abi <dig> and/or other components required to act in concert with abi <dig>  such as abi <dig>  without affecting abi <dig> transcription directly  <cit> . although abi <dig> and  <dig> expression levels is altered at 32°c, abi <dig> and also abi <dig> mutants have wt responses in thermoinhibition of seed germination  <cit> . several uncharacterized bzip genes change in expression level at  <dig> and/or  <dig> h after heat stress and may play more predominant roles than abi <dig> and abi <dig> during germination at high temperatures .

several stress-related genes are induced by high temperature in our microarrays, including hsf, hsp as well as lea genes, most of which are abundant during seed maturation and are also thought to play a role in several abiotic stress responses  <cit> . among the hs-related genes, hsfa <dig> expression in vitro has been shown to be induced by abi <dig>  but not fus <dig>  furthermore, hsfa <dig> mrna is ~10-fold higher in seeds imbibed on aba, suggesting a preferential regulation of hsfa <dig> by aba and abi <dig>  <cit> . although abi <dig> transcripts do not increase in seeds imbibed at high temperature, activation of the hsfa <dig> promoter during hs may require additional factors beside abi <dig>  seed imbibition at high temperature induces the expression of several hsfs at different times, some of which  play important roles during the acquisition of thermotolerance in seedlings, while others  have not been previously shown to be regulated by hs. this is possibly due to the long hs exposure time  and stage of development  used in this microarray compared to previous ones  <cit> . the role of these hsf in thermoinhibition and during prolonged hs remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have uncovered a novel function for the master regulator of seed maturation, fus <dig>  in delaying germination and inhibiting seedling growth at supraoptimal temperature. fus <dig> mrna and protein levels are induced de novo when seeds are imbibed at supraoptimal temperature. furthermore, hyperdormant ml1:fus3-gfp seeds are hypersensitive to thermoinhibition, and this is partly dependent on de novo aba synthesis. physiologically, this is important since increased dormancy can delay or prevent germination at high temperatures and thus has a protective role for the embryo. transcriptomic analysis of seeds imbibed at high temperature reveals that a complex program is activated, which involves not only the regulation of heat and dehydration response genes to adjust cellular functions, but also the induction of aba and repression of ga metabolism and response genes. finally, our study shows that seeds imbibed at high temperature also activate the expression of genes involved in seed-maturation programs, and that fus <dig> is the only master regulator of late embryonic development activated during imbibition at supraoptimal temperature. considering fus <dig> is induced by heat stress, regulated by aba/ga levels and itself regulates aba/ga levels and seed maturation programs, this gene may play an important role in seed responses to high temperature.

we propose a model where fus <dig> protein and aba levels increase during seed imbibition at supraoptimal temperature to delay or inhibit germination through shared as well as independent pathways . once induced by hs, fus <dig> may functions to delay seed germination and prevent seedling growth under unfavorable conditions through positive regulation of aba synthesis. aba in turn stabilizes fus <dig> levels establishing a positive feedback regulation. fus <dig> and aba negatively regulate ga biosynthesis to delay or prevent germination at supraoptimal temperature.
