BACKGROUND
early-diverging lineages can provide important insight into genomic evolution  <cit> . the proteaceae is a large gondwanan plant family belonging to the ‘basal’ eudicots, a paraphyletic group comprising several lineages that diverged prior to the origin and spectacular radiation of largest clade of flowering plants, the ‘core’ eudicots  <cit> . extensive morphological and ecological diversity in the proteaceae make it a focus for studies of adaptive radiation and biome evolution . the long-held view of rainforest ancestry for the proteaceae is challenged by recent fossil evidence for a great diversity and abundance of major lineages in open, fire-prone habitats in central australia during the late cretaceous  <cit> . although species diversity is highest in regions with mediterranean climates including biodiversity hotspots in southwest australia and south africa, generic diversity is highest in rainforests  <cit> .

macadamia is the most economically important proteaceae crop. the industry is based on cultivars developed from the australian subtropical trees macadamia integrifolia, m. tetraphylla and hybrids  <cit> . commercially-grown cultivars are diploid , highly heterozygous and closely-related to their wild progenitors . all four macadamia species are rare and threatened, and the lowland rainforest ecosystems to which they contribute are listed as critically endangered  <cit> . the subtropical rainforests of eastern australia are centres of plant endemism, with high rainfall and low fire frequency that acted as stable refugia through quaternary glaciation and interglacial periods  <cit> . this habitat is in contrast to the open, fire-prone habitats that support the majority of extant proteaceae species.

rainforests are biodiverse and tree survival depends on long-term defense strategies to respond to the biotic stresses imposed by a broad range of insect herbivores and pathogens  <cit> . genome sequencing of the rainforest fruit tree theobroma cacao revealed an expansion of plant resistance  genes, and in particular a group of lrr-rlk receptor protein kinase genes involved in pathogen recognition  <cit> . in comparison to other eudicots, including the model tree populus trichocarpa, there was also evidence for expansion of flavonoid and monoterpene-related genes involved in plant defense, insect resistance and floral scent. while little is known of the defense arsenal of macadamia, cyanogenic glycosides have been identified and cyanide has been detected in seedlings  <cit> . cyanogenesis is the production of hydrogen cyanide in response to wounding or attack by herbivores. although this defense strategy is rare among plants including rainforest trees, it is more common in food plants and in the proteacaeae subfamily grevilleoideae to which macadamia belongs . insect herbivores and fungal pathogens are a major cause of yield reduction in macadamia production and the identification of genes that may confer natural resistance would be of great benefit for crop improvement.

whole genome sequences have been developed for many crop species accelerating the discovery of genes underlying agriculturally important traits  <cit> . for perennial tree crops such as macadamia with long generation times, selective breeding is a protracted and expensive process. genomic information can improve the efficiency and precision of plant breeding through marker-assisted selection  <cit> . sequence data for macadamia is very limited and the composition of the proteaceae genome is unknown. given its position as a large early-diverging eudicot family, its role as a model for adaptive radiation, and the economic importance of macadamia we aimed to characterise the gene space of macadamia integrifolia through genome and transcriptome sequencing, assembly and annotation.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
a draft assembly of the macadamia integrifolia cultivar haes  <dig> was constructed with  <dig>  gb of quality-filtered short-read illumina sequence data . preliminary de novo assembly of paired-end reads was improved by scaffolding with mate pair reads producing  <dig>  scaffolds with a total assembly size of 518 mb. the largest scaffold was  <dig>  bp and n <dig> scaffold size was 4745 bp. the genome was estimated at 652 mb in length based on a k-mer size of 26mer  <cit>  suggesting that the assembly comprises 79% of the genome .table  <dig>

approximately 37% of the assembled genome is identified as repetitive. as reported in most other plant species, long terminal repeats  comprised the largest group accounting for approximately 29% of known repetitive elements and ~11% of the assembled genome . short and long interspersed repeats  accounted for ~18% while the majority of the identified repeats  were unclassified, lacking similarity to known repeats. in total,  <dig>  perfect simple sequence repeat  motifs with di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats were detected. of these,  <dig>   were dinucleotide repeats and consistent with reports for other plant species, the majority of these  were ag/ct repeats  <cit> . in addition, there were  <dig>  tri-,  <dig>  tetra-,  <dig>  penta- and  <dig>  hexanucleotide repeats.fig.  <dig> repeat content of the macadamia genome showing the relative proportions of the long terminal , long and short interspersed , dna element, simple, low-complexity and unclassified repeats identified using repeatmasker and repeatmodeller




transcriptome assembly, gene prediction and functional annotation of proteins
transcriptome assembly using the quality controlled reads from three cdna libraries  in trinity de novo generated  <dig>  contigs  including different isoforms per contig. the transcripts had an n <dig> size of 1339 bp, mean transcript length of 823 bp, maximum transcript length of  <dig>  bp and minimum transcript length of 224 bp . initial transcripts were clustered to generate a final set of  <dig>  transcripts, which were used as one source of evidence in the evidence-based gene model prediction pipeline. final annotation using maker pipeline and assembled transcripts produced  <dig>  high-confidence gene models. of these,  <dig> %  were supported by expression values, fpkm  of  <dig> or more, and  <dig> %  were supported by at least two rna-seq reads. although  <dig> gene models lacked rna-seq read support it is important to note that rna-seq data was collected from flower, leaf and shoot tissue only. over  <dig> and 74% of predicted proteins had at least one significant blastp hit  against nelumbo nucifera or arabidopsis thaliana proteins respectively.

core eukaryotic genes  are  <dig> highly conserved genes understood to be present in virtually all eukaryotes in a reduced number of paralogs  <cit> . among flowering plants,  <dig> single copy genes have been identified that are shared between arabidopsis, oryza, populus and vitis  <cit> . more than 84% of these single copy genes  and 96% of cegs  had a significant blastp hit  against the predicted macadamia genes. assessment of annotation completeness with busco   <cit>  indicates that the macadamia gene space contains  <dig> % of the expected content. using a  <dig> single-copy eukaryote gene set,  <dig> complete single-copy,  <dig> complete duplicated,  <dig> fragmented, and  <dig> missing universal single-copy genes were identified. this compares to  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the expected content in the high-quality genome assemblies of eucalyptus grandis and nelumbo nucifera respectively. in total,  <dig>  macadamia genes were assigned to  <dig>  interproscan  domains and  <dig>  go terms. predicted macadamia genes with a significant blast hit in kass  were assigned to  <dig> known metabolic or signalling pathways. the metabolic pathway  contained the largest number of genes , followed by biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , biosynthesis of antibiotics  and microbial metabolism in diverse environment .

gene family analysis
comparative genome wide analysis of orthologous genes was performed with orthovenn  <cit>  to compare putative macadamia integrifolia protein sequences with those of five other eudicot species including the core eudicots arabidopsis thaliana, eucalyptus grandis, populus trichocarpa, vitis vinifera and the basal eudicot nelumbo nucifera. in total,  <dig>  sequences from the six species were grouped into  <dig>  clusters. of these,  <dig>  clusters contained at least two species and  <dig> were single copy clusters containing one gene for each of the six species. there were  <dig> orthologous gene clusters shared across all six species indicating their conservation within eudicots, while  <dig> clusters containing  <dig> genes were specific to macadamia . macadamia and nelumbo shared  <dig> gene clusters, the highest between any two species compared, consistent with their positions among basal eudicot families.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the distribution of gene families  among six plant species including early diverging eudicots macadamia integrifolia, nelumbo nucifera and core eudicots arabidopsis thaliana, eucalyptus grandis, populus trichocarpa and vitis vinifera





tests for go enrichment of clusters unique to macadamia in comparison to other eudicot plant species identified  <dig> significantly enriched terms , including ten related to biological processes . of these, the most significant terms  were the immune response-regulating signaling pathway , detection of bacterium , regulation of anion activity  and defense response signaling pathway . one or more of these plant defense terms was assigned to  <dig> macadamia-specific clusters containing  <dig> predicted genes . the best swiss-prot hits for these clusters were the lrr receptor-like serine threonine-protein kinases efr and fls <dig>  in total,  <dig> and  <dig> macadamia gene models were functionally annotated as efr and fls <dig> genes respectively. other go terms associated with these clusters included plant-type hypersensitive response , defense response to bacterium  and defense response . in total,  <dig> macadamia gene models with kegg annotation were assigned to plant-pathogen interaction pathways for microbial defense through pathogen-triggered and effector-triggered immunity .table  <dig> hypergeometric test for significantly enriched biological process gene ontology  terms of macadamia-specific gene clusters compared to those identified among six eudicot species




there was also evidence for an expansion of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. in total,  <dig> macadamia gene models were functionally classified using interpro as belonging to the terpene synthase gene family. of these,  <dig> had high protein sequence similarity  in blastp comparisons to arabidopsis thaliana tps-b monoterpene synthases. among macadamia-specific clusters, significantly enriched go terms included  <dig> predicted genes in six clusters involved in terpenoid biosynthetic process , and in particular biosynthesis of monoterpenes through geranyl diphosphate metabolic process  and monoterpene biosynthetic process . monoterpenes, or c <dig> isoprenoids are components of essential oils and fragrance in aromatic plants with roles in pollinator attraction, plant-plant interaction and defense with potential as pesticides and antimicrobial agents. while the functionality of these putative genes is yet to be tested, these results suggest that there may have been a lineage-specific expansion in macadamia of gene families involved in monoterpene synthesis.

identification of candidate genes potentially involved in cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis
in macadamia, the cyanogenic glycoside  dhurrin and its diglucoside derivative proteacin have been identified  <cit> . the metabolic pathways for cyanogenesis are best understood in sorghum bicolor, trifolium repens and prunus spp. with three genes  encoding enzymes in the cg biosynthesis pathway from amino acid. synthesis from specific amino acids is catalysed by cytochrome p450s and udp-glucosyltransferase. cyanogenesis occurs upon tissue disruption with catabolism involving a β-glucosidase and release of hydrogen cyanide  that is either catalyzed by a α-hydroxynitrile lyase  or occurs spontaneously at high ph .fig.  <dig> overview of the biosynthetic and catabolic pathway of cyanogenic glycosides in plants

discussion
illumina shotgun sequencing was used to develop a draft assembly of m. integrifolia, the first for the large basal eudicot family proteaceae. a de novo assembly was constructed with  <dig>  gb of quality-filtered dna sequence data. transcriptome assembly from  <dig>  gb of rna-seq data from leaf, shoot and flower tissue generated  <dig>  transcripts. these were used as reference ests, and with the proteins of nelumbo nucifera and arabidopsis thaliana provided sources of evidence in the gene model prediction pipeline  <cit> . using maker,  <dig>  protein-coding genes were predicted of which over 90% were expressed in at least one of the green tissues examined. subsequent evaluation of these gene models showed significant similarity to 96% of core eukaryotic genes  <cit>  and 84% of single copy genes shared by the angiosperm taxa arabidopsis, oryza, populus and vitis  <cit>  indicating that our assembly covers much of the functional gene space of macadamia. in comparison to the eudicots arabidopsis, vitis, populus, eucalyptus and nelumbo,  <dig> gene families were specific to macadamia. the closest available complete genome sequence, that of the aquatic sacred lotus nelumbo nucifera  <cit> , is over  <dig> million years divergent based on fossil evidence and dated molecular phylogenies  <cit> . macadamia and nelumbo shared  <dig> gene clusters, the highest between any two taxa compared here and consistent with their relatively close taxonomic positions of proteaceae and nelumbonaceae among basal eudicot families.

quality assessment of the draft genome assembly as determined by technical measurements including the number of scaffolds  and n <dig>  indicate that it is fragmented in comparison to completed plant genomes, and further work is required to develop a more contiguous genome with scaffolds anchored to chromosomes. however, quality assessment based on expectations of gene content using busco sets  <cit>  indicate that  <dig> % of the expected gene content is represented in our assembly. this compares to  <dig>  and  <dig> % in the comprehensively assembled and annotated genomes of eucalyptus grandis  <cit>  and nelumbo nucifera  <cit>  respectively. ongoing efforts to improve coverage and reduce fragmentation include deeper short read genome sequencing, incorporation of longer pacbio reads, transcriptome sequencing of additional tissues and the development of a high-density genetic linkage map. macadamia integrifolia is a diploid species with a haploid number of  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . there are no previously published estimates of genome size. in a recent extensive assessment of proteaceae genome size from flow cytometry-based estimates, a 60-fold range was reported. most grevilleiodeae species, however, had relatively small genome sizes with 1c values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  pg  genome  <cit> . the kmer-based estimate of 652 mb from this study is relatively small compared to closely-related species, and suggests that the draft assembly spans approximately 79% of the genome.

evidence for expansion of plant defense-related gene families
rainforests are among the oldest and most diverse ecosystems  <cit> . australian subtropical rainforests in particular, are ancient refugia with high levels of plant species richness, endemism and rainfall  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that insects and pathogens are instrumental in the maintenance of plant species diversity in rainforests  <cit> . likewise, elevated predator-pathogen pressure is hypothesised to increase and diversify plant chemical defense systems. plants have developed a wide range of defense systems to respond to the biotic stresses exerted by the predators and pathogens with which they have co-evolved  <cit> . expansion of the receptor-like kinase genes in particular is purportedly in response to fast-evolving pathogens  <cit> . comparative genomic analyses suggests that there has been a lineage specific expansion in macadamia of gene families with similarity to arabidopsis lrr receptor-like serine threonine-protein kinases efr and fls <dig>  these encode proteins that play a key role in pathogen recognition and the activation of plant defense response  <cit>  and it has been demonstrated that arabidopsis efr enhances bacterium resistance in dicot and monocot transgenic plants including rice  <cit> . further research is needed to identify the complete suite of macadamia plant resistance and defense genes and to determine whether polymorphism at sites on candidate genes is associated with resistance to co-evolving pathogens in macadamia as has been previously reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . future growth in macadamia global production is expected following rapid expansion of cultivation and demand particularly in asia. germplasm collections, including clones of wild and domesticated trees have been established. these resources, along with wild populations undoubtedly contain genetic variants of interest for breeding, including improved yield, nutritional benefits, pest resistance and capacity to grow under variable climatic conditions. insect herbivores and microbial pathogens are a major cause of yield reduction in macadamia production and identification of natural resistance would be of benefit for crop improvement.

genes involved in cyanogenesis
cyanogenesis is a plant chemical defense response to generalist herbivores involving the release of hydrogen cyanide following tissue disruption and hydrolysis of cyanogenic glycosides   <cit> . endogenous recycling without cyanide release suggests that cgs serve additional biological roles including nitrogen and carbon supply at specific plant developmental stages  <cit>  and there is evidence that intermediate compounds produced during biosynthesis of cgs have anti-microbial activity . while relatively few plant species are cyanogenic, they are over-represented among food plants  <cit>  and are common in the proteacaeae, particularly in the subfamily grevilleiodeae to which macadamia belongs  <cit> .

in macadamia, cyanide has been detected in seed, root, cotyledon and leaf tissue  <cit> . while levels in mature kernels of the commercial species m. integrifolia and m. tetraphylla are extremely low, they are much higher in the bitter mature kernels of m. ternifolia and m. jansenii. in almond prunus amygadalus, bitterness of the kernel is determined by the content of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin  <cit> . intraspecific and temporal variation in cyanogenic capacity, and acyanogenic individuals have been reported in a number of cyanogenic plant taxa . in white clover trifolium repens, inheritance follows a mendelian two-locus model. the ac/ac  gene controls production of cyanogenic glycosides, and the li/li  gene controls their hydrolysis  <cit> . there is an apparent selective advantage for acyanogenic individuals in colder climates, and polymorphism is maintained within populations through recurrent gene deletions over time  <cit> .

we identified macadamia homologues with high sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in cg biosynthesis in other cyanogenic plants including sorghum bicolor and trifolium repens. based on the relatively high rna-seq expression values in green tissue, six homologues to genes encoding the enzymes cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  ugt <dig> and β-glucosidase are probable candidates in macadamia to target for further analysis. the discovery of candidate cyanogenesis genes in macadamia is likely to be an important step in facilitating the utilization of the smaller tree species m. ternifolia and m. jansenii into breeding programs to reduce tree size while retaining kernel edibility. in previous studies, 28% of the proteaceae species tested were cyanogenic. this compares to  <dig> % of  <dig> species from  <dig> families in australian rainforests, and 4% of eucalyptus species  <cit> . the high proportion of cyanogenic plants in proteaceae indicates that cyanogenesis is an important defense strategy in this family. further work is planned to validate candidate genes, screen wild macadamia germplasm for natural variants and investigate the interaction between pest resistance, climatic variation and cyanogenesis in macadamia and more broadly across the proteaceae.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first available genomic resources for the large basal eudicot family proteaceae and provides a platform for comparative genomics. as a recently domesticated subtropical tree crop with a long generation time, macadamia presents unique challenges for crop improvement. macadamia breeding and the utilisation of wild germplasm resources is presently restricted by a paucity of genomic information. we have assembled genome and transcriptome sequence data and here introduce the gene space of macadamia integrifolia as a resource to access to most macadamia genes. this presents opportunities to uncover genes and markers associated with variation in traits of importance for conservation, domestication and crop improvement.
