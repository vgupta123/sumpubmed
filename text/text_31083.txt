BACKGROUND
phytohormones are organic compounds that exist naturally in plants and that even in low concentrations, orchestrate a broad range of physiological processes, including growth and development, as well as responses to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . these hormones overlap signal transduction pathways or gene expression profiles by rapid induction or by preventing the degradation of transcriptional regulators .

among all of the described phytohormones, ethylene, a naturally occurring triple response growth regulator  in seedlings, has been studied since ancient times  <cit> . ethylene is also involved in leaf abscission, fruit ripening and senescence  <cit>  as well as seed germination, growth of adventitious roots under flooding conditions, epinasty stimulation, inhibition of shoot growth and stomatal closing and flowering  <cit> . moreover, it is involved in a wide variety of stresses, including wounding, pathogen attack, flooding, drought, hypoxia, and temperature shifts  <cit> .

ethylene biosynthesis is derived from the amino acid methionine provided by the yang cycle  <cit> , in which the precursor s-adenosylmethionine  is synthesized from atp and methionine by s-adenosylmethionine synthetase   <cit> . adomet is then converted into 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  and 5-methylthioadenosine  by the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylase synthase   <cit> . mta is recycled through a series of yang cycle reactions back to methionine  <cit> .

active acss are encoded by eight genes in arabidopsis thaliana, and at least one encodes a catalytically inactive acs  . based on the sequence present in its c-terminal region, these proteins can be divided into three main groups: type i proteins, which are the targets for phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> and/or  <dig>   <cit>  as well as by calcium-dependent protein kinase ; type ii proteins, which show phosphorylation sites for only cpk  <cit> ; and type iii proteins, which have the c-terminal portion greatly reduced and do not present phosphorylation sites for either kinase. furthermore, the acss can be regulated by putative endogenous signal receptors  and/or intracellular accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as calcium. in the absence of an endogen signal, type ii acss are degraded by 26s proteasome. this degradation is mediated by eto proteins  and eol , which are members of specific plant proteins with e <dig> ubiquitin ligase domain  <cit> . this process activates kinase protein signaling, which culminates in the stabilization of type ii acss. furthermore, mpk3- <dig> kinases are able to phosphorylate the c-terminal of type i acss, which preserve and stabilize their degradation via the 26s proteasome pathway, thereby increasing the production of ethylene and inducing other ethylene-dependent signaling pathways  <cit> .

the enzyme directly responsible for the ethylene biosynthesis is 1-aminociclopropane-1-acid carboxylic oxidase , which converts acc into this plant hormone  <cit> .

several reports have suggested that the acc metabolite could combine with other organic molecules. different studies have demonstrated that the acc n-malonyzation pathway in various plant tissues is involved in the regulation of ethylene production, wherein the conjugate 1-malonyl-acc  is formed by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-acid carboxylic acid-n-malonyltransferase, an enzyme that has been purified from plant protein extracts but without reference to its respective gene  <cit> . in addition to macc formation through a metabolic route, acc can also be conjugated in the form of 1-glutamyl-acc  in a reaction that is catalyzed by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase   <cit> .

another possible acc metabolic pathway is the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme acc deaminase , a protein that degrades acc into oxobutyrate  and ammonia , thus decreasing the levels of acc that are available for ethylene production  <cit> . the acd gene was first identified in a. thaliana and populus, and studies of tomato plants have shown that acd activity varies during fruit ripening and that its peak activity coincides with the reduction in ethylene synthesis  <cit> .

the classic routes of ethylene intracellular signal transduction, initially described in a. thaliana, are triggered by the gas interaction with membrane receptors  and the modulation of ctr <dig>  activity to regulate the expression of several genes, such as ein3/eil . both receptors and ctr <dig> function as negative regulators of the signal transduction pathway in the absence of ethylene. the kinase ctr <dig> phosphorylates the ein <dig>  c-terminal domain, allowing for the degradation of this protein. etp <dig> and etp <dig>  play important roles in ein <dig> proteolysis. these proteins, which have f-box domains, interact with the conserved ein <dig> c-terminal domain that was previously phosphorylated by ctr <dig>  thus, in the absence of ethylene, the phosphorylated ein <dig> c-terminal domain is ubiquitinated and then degraded by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . however, in the presence of ethylene, instead of being phosphorylated, the ein <dig> domain is cleaved and transported to the nucleus to stimulate ein3/eil activity by repressing ebf . thus, ein3/einl induce the transcription of target genes, mainly the ap2/erf transcription factor superfamily  <cit> . earlier studies have also suggested an ein3/eil activation route independent of ein <dig> and ctr via a phosphorylation cascade of kinase proteins, mkk4-5- <dig>  → mpk3- <dig>  which is mitogen activated  <cit> . in the presence of a signal, ein3/eil transcription factors are phosphorylated by mpk3- <dig> and do not interact with the f-box protein ebf , preventing their degradation through the 26s proteasome. thus, these factors that accumulate in the nucleus interact with target gene promoters and trigger different ethylene responses  <cit> . in addition, the exoribonuclease 5’-3’ ein <dig> , another positive regulator, promotes ebf mrna decrease and thereby increases ein3/eil protein levels in the nucleus  <cit> .

ethylene signal transduction triggers substantial changes in the gene expression of plant cells. promoter region analyses of the genes induced by ethylene led to the identification of cis-acting elements as well as the trans-acting protein erebp  family, which interacts with dna and erfs  . recent studies have demonstrated that ein3/eil are erf <dig>  gene activators, constituting an erf family member that establishes a hierarchy of ethylene-mediated signaling  <cit> . the homodimers ein3/eil interact with cis-acting elements in the erf <dig> promoter region that once transcribed and translated, interact with other cis-acting elements present in the promoter regions of target genes  <cit> . ein <dig> can induce transcription not only of erf <dig> but also of other members of the ap2/erf transcription factor superfamily  <cit> .

the mechanism underlying environmental stress tolerance has been extensively studied in model plants in attempts to determine its impact on agriculture  <cit> . the metabolic pathways induced under drought in a. thaliana have been associated with abscisic acid -dependent and aba-independent pathways governing drought-inducible gene expression  <cit>  as well as the existence of an interconnection between both signaling pathways  <cit> . furthermore, advanced aba and ethylene signaling research has revealed that under stress, both hormones act antagonistically among yield-impacting processes  <cit> .

although ethylene has been extensively studied in the plant senescence process, its role during drought-induced senescence is less well known. it has been demonstrated that under drought conditions, ethylene caused leaf abscission and consequently reduced water loss  <cit> . under water deficit, ethylene production was paralleled by an increase and subsequent decrease in acc, suggesting that water stress induced the de novo synthesis of acc synthase, which is the rate-controlling enzyme along the pathway of ethylene biosynthesis. moreover, ethylene and its metabolic process are important for activating plant responses to flooding and water deficit  <cit> . it activates a signal transduction network that culminates in the synthesis of several transcription factors that regulate gene activation/repression during stress, such as erf <dig>  <cit> .

despite important insights having been reported in ethylene signaling pathways, the available studies have not addressed the soybean , an economically important crop. this commodity is the second largest source of edible oil and the most important high-quality vegetable protein for feeding both humans and animals worldwide. however, deficiency in water supply can negatively impact this crop, reducing yields and posing threats to farmers and food production in several countries  <cit> .

considering the important position that soybean occupies in the brazilian economy, the second largest world soybean producer, the brazilian soybean genome consortium  was created to identify the genes related to different biotic and abiotic stresses. because there have been no reports concerning ethylene molecular mechanisms in soybean, this work described the ethylene metabolic pathway in silico in the soybean genome using various databases. the gene expression profile data obtained from the genosoja database was validated by rt-qpcr experiments, and determinations of free acc levels and ethylene production in susceptible and tolerant soybean genotypes under water deficit conditions were also performed. moreover, transcriptional regulation was studied by analyzing putative cis-acting elements present in the possible promoters. these data allowed for the inference of the first accurate in silico models for soybean ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, which facilitated a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this important phytohormone.

RESULTS
in silico reconstruction of soybean ethylene molecular models
to evaluate the influence of ethylene in soybean water stress response, it was necessary to reconstruct the metabolic pathways to improve those available in public databases. hence, we conducted an extensive search in the crop genome for genes previously associated with ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction. thus, a total of  <dig> genes were analyzed, of which  <dig> corresponded to model plants  and  <dig> to glycine max . all of the soybean genes were mapped on their respective chromosomes  and were functionally annotated . the proteins identified in model plants a. thaliana  and o. sativa  as well as in glycine max  were thoroughly characterized in silico, making possible the identification of the main characteristic domains. the soybean orthologous proteins in a. thaliana and o. sativa were investigated by bbh  analysis, comparing the three species databases . according to these data , accurate soybean models of ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction have been proposed.table  <dig> ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction gene summary in different plants

the putative soybean proteins that participate in the metabolic pathways involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling mediated by this molecule are highly conserved, with domains that have already been described for their homologs in model organisms. the bbh experiment suggested a higher phylogenetic proximity of soybean to a. thaliana, corroborating that both are classified as dicotyledonous, although significant portions of these proteins are conserved in all three species. the ontological analysis indicated the same conclusion, showing that both function and molecular processes as well as the cell localization of these proteins were similar in different species.

soybean ethylene biosynthesis model
based on the model for ethylene biosynthesis in a. thaliana, the  <dig> genes of soybean related to this metabolic route were divided into three groups: yang cycle genes ; ethylene biosynthesis ; and acc conjugation or degradation  .

pommerrenig et al.  <cit>  described a model for methionine recycling reactions through the yang cycle in plantago and a. thaliana  <cit> . based on this work, we proposed an in silico model for this route in soybean, in which the homologs for all components were identified: mtn , mtk , mti , dep , ard  and aat  or asp   . each of the identified enzymes had at least one ortholog in a. thaliana and/or o. sativa identified in silico through the bhh experiment, suggesting plausible conservation of the pathway in different plant species.fig.  <dig> soybean model of ethylene biosynthesis. in silico experiments identified  <dig> proteins that could be involved directly or indirectly in soybean ethylene biosynthesis. in this putative model: green - yang cycle; red - ethylene biosynthesis; blue - acc  degradation and conjugation with other metabolites ; yellow - lignin and polyamine biosynthesis . enzymes:  <dig> - mat  or sams ;  <dig> - acs ;  <dig> - aco ;  <dig> - mtn ;  <dig> - mtk ;  <dig> - mti ;  <dig> - dep ;  <dig> - ard ;  <dig> - aat  or asp ;  <dig> - acd ;  <dig> - act ;  <dig> - ggt . other abbreviations: asc - ascorbate; dhasc - dihydroxyascorbate; hcn - hydrogen cyanide. the blue asterisks  present in numbers  <dig> and  <dig> indicate enzymes that could be candidates to play the roles described in the model, but their functions described in vitro and in vivo are not primarily associated with these metabolic pathways. each enzyme is represented by a generic name 



the first enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway, mat  or sams, is responsible for the production of the adomet used for ethylene production and also for lignin and polyamine synthesis  <cit> . among the eleven mat proteins in soybean, five were bhh-positive with possible orthologs in a. thaliana and/or o. sativa.

subsequently, the classification of  <dig> soybean acss was proposed by tucker et al.  <cit> , who reported phylogenetic relationships with similar acss in a. thaliana, suggesting that they are expressed when the plant is infected by the nematode heterodera glycines  <cit> . in our work, we studied the phylogenetic relationships of acs amino acids residues between g. max and a. thaliana and also with its homologues in o. sativa. we also determined in silico the possible phosphorylation sites of the respective kinases . the distribution of the sequences is similar to that presented by tucker  <cit>  because they are distributed uniformly, indicating high conservation between species. moreover, although the sequences of gmacs# <dig>  gmacs# <dig>  gmacs# <dig> and gmacs# <dig> present high similarity with acs, they are phylogenetically unrelated to the rest because differences were found in the catalytic domain. therefore, these sequences were named acs-like, i.e., belonging to the family of aats . among the seventeen acs sequences identified in soybean, six were possible orthologs of a. thaliana and/or o. sativa, of which two were determined to be type i , two to be type ii  and two to be type iii  .

regarding the conversion of acc into ethylene, sixteen aco genes were identified in the soybean genome, with  <dig> of them encoding ortholog proteins in a. thaliana and/or o. sativa  .

furthermore, acc can also be used in combination with malonyl and glutamyl in the synthesis of macc  and gacc   <cit> . we selected thirty possible candidate genes with this function in soybean, based on six acyltransferases  from a. thaliana and o. sativa . five were considered bbh-positive with a. thaliana and/or o. sativa  . it is important to emphasize that although most of the malonyltransferase enzymes play roles in fatty acids, they could also have n-malonyzation activity. thus, it would be interesting to characterize them in vitro and in vivo after selecting them in silico. with regard to the formation of gacc, five γ-glutamyl transpeptidases  were identified in soybean, and two of them  were bbh-positive with a. thaliana and o. sativa .

finally, acc could be the substrate of acc deaminase  in soybean because we identified two genes that codified for homologous acd enzymes in a. thaliana , of which only one was bhh-positive  .

model for soybean ethylene-mediated signal transduction
in this work, we identified  <dig> genes related to ethylene-mediated signal transduction. we found that  <dig>  % of the proteins coded by these genes had orthologs in a. thaliana and/or o. sativa . the main components of this signal route were represented because  <dig>  % were specific receptors  and proteins important for receptor activity ,  <dig>  % were ctr,  <dig>  % were ein <dig> proteins, approximately  <dig>  % were kinases ,  <dig>  % were ein3/einl transcription factors,  <dig>  % were important in proteolysis routes , and  <dig>  % were orthologs of ein <dig> exoribonuclease, which is important for ein3/einl activity regulation .fig.  <dig> soybean model of ethylene signal transduction. in silico experiments identified  <dig> proteins that could be involved directly or indirectly in soybean signal transduction initiated by ethylene. in this putative model, brown rectangles show the route-identified proteins in a. thaliana, and white rectangles show the soybean genes that encode proteins homologous to this plant model; orange rectangles illustrate membrane sensors that respond to biotic and abiotic stress in addition to receptors/sensors for endogenous signals ; the purple rectangle represents mrnas related to etp proteins; the rectangle with dotted outline  represents a protein in this pathway that has not been identified in the studied plants; blue and purple hexagons represent acss types i and ii, respectively; black and red circles correspond to ubiquitin and phosphate groups, respectively; gray arrows correspond to routes that occur in the presence of ethylene and/or biotic/abiotic stress; dotted arrows in red and gray represent pathways that occur in the absence of this hormone and routes that culminate in ethylene biosynthesis, respectively; black lines indicate interactions among proteins. cellular compartments represented: endoplasmic reticulum , golgi complex , nucleus  and cytoplasm . symbols: acs: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase; cpk : calcium-dependent protein kinase; ctr: constitutive triple response protein; ebf: ein <dig> binding f-box protein; eil: ein protein like; ein: ethylene insensitive; eol: eto protein like; erf: ethylene response factor; etp: ein <dig> targeting protein; eto: ethylene overproducer; mkkk : map kinase kinase kinase; mkk : map kinase kinase; mpk : mitogen-activated protein kinase; ran: responsive to antagonist; rav: related to abi3/vp1; rte: reversion to ethylene sensitivity. the route of intracellular signal transduction is initiated by the interaction of ethylene with a membrane receptor  and through the modulation of ctr activity, which regulates the activity of several genes, such as ein <dig>  the receptors with ctr  work similarly to negative regulators of the pathway and, in the absence of ethylene, suppress downstream positive components of signal transduction. the hormone binding blocks the receptors in an inactive conformation, reducing the repression of metabolic pathway-positive regulators  <cit> . in the absence of ethylene, ctr phosphorylates the ein <dig> c-terminal domain, promoting its interaction with etp f-box protein  and its subsequent degradation via proteasome 26s  <cit> . in the absence of ein <dig> c-terminal phosphorylation , this domain is cleaved and moves to the nucleus, where it stimulates ein3/eil activity by ebf repression , which in turn induces target genes transcription through some members of the ap2/erf superfamily of transcriptional factors  <cit> . in addition to the interaction with the c-terminus of ein <dig>  ein3/eil activity can be influenced by the mkk4-5-9 → mpk3- <dig> phosphorylation cascade, which is ctr/ein2-independent. in the presence of a signal, the ein3/eil transcriptional factors are phosphorylated by mpk3- <dig>  preventing the interaction with ebf and their degradation via the 26s proteasome. thus, ein <dig> and eil accumulate in the nucleus, interact with gene target promoters and trigger ethylene responses  <cit> . another positive regulator is ein <dig>  a 5’-3’-exoribonuclease that promotes ebf mrna decay, increasing the levels of ein3/eil in the nucleus  <cit> . additionally, ethylene biosynthesis is also regulated. possible receptors for endogenous signals  can induce the secondary metabolites accumulation  in an intracellular environment and activate protein kinases , culminating in the stabilization of type ii acss, an important enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. then, type ii acss  are phosphorylated by cpk <dig>  which prevents the interaction of these enzymes with eto/eol and their subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome. this event induces an increase in ethylene production and the activation of signal transduction pathways  <cit> . moreover, various stress conditions  induce the activation of mapk modules . the mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> kinases are able to phosphorylate the c-terminal type i acss , which stabilize and protect these enzymes against 26s proteasome degradation  <cit> . there is no consensus regarding the direct participation of ctr in a route involving mpk3- <dig>  <cit> . the receptor activity is associated with two proteins: ran, a copper carrier protein   <cit> ; and rte, a protein with an unknown mechanism of action that facilitates the transition among active and inactive states of one receptor, etr <dig>  <cit> . each protein is represented by a generic name: ein2: gmein# <dig>  gmein# <dig> and gmein#007; ein3: gmein# <dig>  gmein# <dig>  gmein# <dig>  gmein# <dig> and gmein#010; ein5: gmein# <dig>  gmein# <dig> and gmein#011; mkk4: gmmkk# <dig> and gmmkk#003; mkk5: without representatives identified in soybean;

four of the five ethylene receptors described in soybean were found to be homologs of etr <dig> and etr <dig>  and of ers <dig> and ein <dig>  .

the receptors in soybean have four principal domains similar to those in a. thaliana:  receptor response regulation domain ;  histidine kinase a domain ;  gaf domain ; and  histidine kinase−, dna girase b− and atpase-like . the different combinations of these four domains comprise the different families of receptors in soybean. for example, the etr <dig> homologs have the four domains in their structure because homologs to etr <dig> and ein <dig> have only the ,  and  domains and ers <dig> has the ,  and  domains.

regarding canonical ethylene signal transduction, we identified five soybean homologs of ctr <dig>  four of rte genes, seven ran transporters and three homologs of ein <dig>  . it is worth mentioning that homologs encoding the etp proteins could not be found in soybean, suggesting either that other proteins are performing this role or that other mechanisms regulating ein <dig> exist but have not yet been discovered. furthermore, we also found five homologs of ein3/eil  and three of ein <dig>  in the g. max genome.

finally, with regard to the main kinases and f-box proteins related to ethylene signal transduction, thirteen homologs of the kinases were found in the soybean genome, with four of them being homologs of mkk4/mkk <dig>  four of mpk3/mpk <dig> and five of cpk <dig> as well as seven of ebf and ten homologs of eto/eol .

transcriptional regulation of soybean ethylene genes
to understand better their transcriptional regulation mechanisms, we performed an in silico analysis of the putative promoter regions of the  <dig> soybean genes. we identified  <dig>  elements in these putative promoters, corresponding to  <dig> cis-acting element families described in the literature for their transcriptional regulation in different plant species .fig.  <dig> distribution of cis-acting elements in putative soybean gene promoters. the graph shows the distribution of cis-acting elements in promoter regions of soybean genes, related to ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction. the cis-acting element families identified were as follows: abre ; aref ; ataf ; brre ; caat ; cdc <dig> ; ce1f ; cnac ; dpbf ; dreb ; einl ; eref ; flo <dig> ; garp ; gbox ; gccf ; heat ; jare ; lrem ; miig ; mybl ; mybs ; mycl ; nacf ; ptbp ; rav <dig> ; rav <dig> ; salt ; swns 



as expected, all of the promoter regions contained elements from ptpb  and/or caat , suggesting that the analyzed sequences have a strong likelihood of being real gene promoters.

apart from the ptpb and caat families, the most represented families in this analysis were those related to transcription factors myb, myc and nac  and to elements known for heat and light response . interestingly, no cis-acting elements were found from the rav <dig> family in any of the putative promoters, indicating that there are possible variations in recognizing the sequence of the b <dig> domain that is representative of the rav family in soybean. another possibility could be that the regulation occurs because of the interaction of the ap <dig> domain with the rav <dig> cis-acting element, which is broadly dispersed in the analyzed regions  <cit> .

the families einl  and gccf  of cis-acting elements are most likely directly related to the regulation of metabolic pathways in which ethylene plays a critical role. einl and gccf were present in  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, of the putative promoters analyzed . the dreb  and eref  elements are known for their involvement in the response to different stresses, and they were found in  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, of the analyzed sequences.

when we analyzed the cis-acting elements contained in the putative promoters of the ethylene biosynthesis genes, we observed that  <dig>  % had einl elements and that  <dig>  % had gccf elements. moreover, other cis-acting elements that respond to other phytohormones were detected, of which the jare family  was present in more than  <dig>  % of the putative promoters, followed by the abre and ce1f  families, which were present in  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, of the putative promoters. moreover,  <dig>  % of them have elements that respond to auxin  and  <dig>  % to brassinosteroids . finally, the elements dreb and eref could be detected in  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the putative promoters, respectively.

considering the group with an ethylene-mediated transduction signal, we observed the presence of einl elements in  <dig>  % and gccf in  <dig>  % of the putative promoters. we also detected the jare element in more than  <dig>  % of the sequences analyzed, abre and ce1f in  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, the auxin and brassinosteroid response elements in  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, and the dreb and eref elements in  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the putative promoters, respectively.

the analysis of the putative promoters showed that the activation or repression of the transcription of a gene in soybean is not likely to be regulated by isolated transcription factors but rather by the interaction of different proteins in a set of dna-regulatory sequences. in accordance with this hypothesis, this study supported the results of other studies that had proposed crosstalk between the regulation of ethylene metabolism with other development mechanisms, homeostasis and response to various stresses. this affirmation was confirmed by the detection in the possible promoters of different cis-acting elements important for responses to other phytohormones, in addition to elements involved in different biotic and abiotic stress responses . the presence of cis-acting elements in the  <dig> global soybean genes analyzed showed that the jare elements were the most abundant, followed by einl, dreb and abre. the putative promoter analysis indicated that each cis-acting element family could contribute in distinct ways to the regulation of the considered soybean genes: abre, einl, aref and brre are the most represented in the putative promoters of ethylene biosynthesis genes, and jare, dreb, eref, ce1f and gccf are the most represented in the putative promoters of ethylene-mediated signal transduction . few  of the putative promoters presented gccf cis-acting elements , whereas almost half of them had the very similar dreb element, which responds first to drought stress. these proportions were the same in the genes that were differentially expressed in drought stress. recent chip  experiments showed that the transcription factor erf <dig> from a. thaliana could interact directly with both cis-acting element families. more interestingly, this transcription factor interacted with gccf elements under biotic stress conditions and with dreb elements under abiotic stress conditions but never with both at the same time  <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution of cis-acting element families important in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in putative soybean promoters. the diagram corresponds to the number of possible soybean promoters and the number of cis-acting elements present in each group analyzed: ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction. the line thickness is directly related to the contribution of each family of cis-acting elements in each group: the thinnest lines correspond to the fewest number of elements and putative promoters that have them, and the thickest line corresponds to the highest number of elements and putative promoters that have them. abre - aba response elements; aref - auxin response elements; brre - brassinosteroid response elements; ce1f - coupling elements  <dig> binding factors; dreb - dehydration responsive element binding factors; einl - ethylene insensitive  <dig> like factors; eref - ethylene response element factors; gccf - gcc-box family; jare - jasmonate response elements



the data showed that  <dig>  % of the putative promoters have the lrem cis-acting element  and that  <dig>  % have heat elements  . in a. thaliana, the response to low light intensity could be regulated by ethylene and auxins . similarly, ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction, regulated by phytochrome b, are affected by antiphase light and temperature cycles  <cit> . complementary studies with etiolated pea stems showed that in addition to light intensity, red light also regulates ethylene biosynthesis and gravitropism  <cit> . additionally, mutants in receptors or orthologs of ein <dig> sensitive to ethylene produce high levels of the gas, whereas ctr1- <dig> mutants produce lower levels of ethylene than wild plants  <cit> . however, although the double mutants ein3/einl <dig> have similar phenotypes to ein <dig> mutants, they produce low levels of ethylene when grown under long day periods but high levels when grown under dark conditions and even lower levels of ethylene than in etr <dig> and ein <dig> mutants  <cit> . thus, it is suggested that there is a parallel route to ein3/eil that is responsible for the negative control of ethylene biosynthesis, a mechanism that is light dependent. transcriptional regulation could be associated with the light-responsive transcription factors that interact with lrem elements, which can modulate the response depending on the variation of the g-box sequences that commonly flank the lrem elements  <cit> . because more than  <dig>  % of the putative promoters have gbox elements and are associated with a high rate of lrem, we believe that the mechanisms involving ein3/einl, its partners or regulated factors, and other light-responsive factors play important roles in the regulation of soybean ethylene biosynthesis.

many differentially expressed transcripts identified in soybean transcriptomes have been described in the literature as being important in the response to drought. the functions of these transcripts could be associated with not only ethylene biosynthesis and signaling but also with other metabolic pathways. for example, the enzymes responsible for adomet production in ethylene biosynthesis also contribute to other metabolic pathways that are ethylene-independent. plant polyamines in a. thaliana are involved in the response to different environmental stresses, and recent studies have indicated that polyamine signaling is involved in direct interactions with different metabolic pathways and intricate hormonal crosstalks, such as aba regulation in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . because mat  enzymes provide the substrate for polyamine synthesis, it is very probable that these enzymes are induced by aba in the response to abiotic stresses, as was demonstrated in tomato plants that had high levels of these enzyme transcripts under nacl stress conditions and after aba treatment  <cit> . thus, it could be suggested that high levels of aba are related to low levels of ethylene because of a possible redirection of adomet toward the biosynthesis of polyamines. we observed that among the mat genes in soybean,  <dig>  % have abre in their putative promoters, indicating induction of these genes by aba in response to abiotic stresses.

the presence of elements responsive to other phytohormones must also be considered in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. zhang and coworkers  <cit>  demonstrated that aba could induce the genes that encode the enzymes acc synthase and acc oxidase, stimulating ethylene biosynthesis and fruit ripening  <cit> . additionally, studies have shown that one of the first actions of auxins is the induction of acss, which increase ethylene production  <cit> . along with auxins, brassinosteroids and methyl-jasmonate could also induce aco enzymes, increasing ethylene production in maize and olive plants  <cit> .

these studies with putative soybean promoters are important not only for a better understanding of ethylene signaling in this crop but also for the production of genetically modified plants with genes regulated under different stress conditions separately and/or simultaneously.

analysis and validation of soybean transcriptomes in water deficit conditions
transcriptome databank analysis of water deficit contrasted with soybean genotypes
to investigate the expression of soybean genes, we studied the transcriptome of two cultivars with contrasting responses to drought stress . the plants were grown hydroponically and under different water stress conditions. the transcriptomes, provided by the genosoja project, were constructed using subtraction library hybridization , which detects differential expression of transcripts under water stress. in this database,  <dig>  % of the genes identified were expressed differentially in at least one of the listed situations. among them,  <dig>  % were related to ethylene biosynthesis and  <dig>  % to its signal transduction . furthermore, we found that  <dig>  % of differentially expressed genes were detected in sensitive br <dig>   <dig>  % were detected in drought-resistant embrapa <dig>  and  <dig>  % were present in both cultivar databases. these contrasting results might be explained by the genetic basis of each cultivar providing the relative variations in the gene expression or by a discrepancy between the obtained unique sequences and the cultivar databases   <cit> .

we observed that  <dig>  % of the differentially expressed genes were detected uniquely in roots ,  <dig>  % were detected exclusively in leaves , and  <dig>  % were expressed in both roots and leaves. these results, together with the normalized data presented , suggested that the expression of genes in the roots was preferentially observed in the drought-tolerant embrapa <dig>  whereas in the leaves, the differential expression was more proportionate depending on the group of genes and the duration of stress.

furthermore, the expression of both groups of genes was analyzed. we observed that  <dig>  % of the biosynthesis genes were expressed in roots and leaves of the sensitive and tolerant cultivars. among them,  <dig>  % were expressed in only sensitive br <dig>  mainly in the leaves. conversely,  <dig>  % differential expression was detected exclusively in tolerant embrapa <dig>  mainly in the roots .

in ethylene-mediated signal transduction,  <dig>  % of the genes were differentially expressed under water stress conditions. in the sensitive cultivar,  <dig>  % were differentially expressed, mostly in the leaves, and in the tolerant cultivar,  <dig>  % had a differential expression, mainly in the roots .

transcriptome functional validation of the candidate genes
to validate the data obtained in silico, the levels of some differentially expressed genes were assessed by rt-qpcr in both leaf and root tissues exposed to drought stress. the plants were grown under the same conditions as those used for transcriptome analysis. the ct  values obtained are listed .

the expression of the genes mat, acs and aco were found to have the same differential trends as the data obtained in silico, although with variations in the expression profiles . this result could be due to limitations in the construction of the genosoja subtractive libraries and general experimental variations. as an example, the expression of acs is different in both cultivars and tissues with rt-qpcr, but it was detected in only the transcriptome of the roots of embrapa <dig> fig.  <dig> expression of ethylene-related genes in soybean under drought stress conditions. the graphs show the expression levels, obtained by rt-qpcr, of five soybean genes related to ethylene biosynthesis  and ethylene signal transduction . the expression of these genes in the experiment was compared in roots and leaves of soybean cultivars br <dig> and embrapa <dig> after different durations of drought stress. in the column graphs  <dig> and  <dig>  the statistical analysis was performed by comparing similar tissues in both cultivars under the same conditions of drought stress . the asterisks represent the level of statistical significance:  p ≤  <dig> ;   <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> ;   <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> . each dot represents the average amount  of three experimental replicates  in three biological samples , totaling nine replicates. the standard error is not presented with some of the dots because their absolute values are lower than the scale. after normalization based on housekeeping genes, the values given in the graph are relative to the lowest expression, whose value was set at  <dig> . information about the target genes is presented 



induction kinetics analysis of soybean acs and aco genes confirmed the temporality of the metabolic reactions catalyzed by these enzymes in both cultivars because acs gene expression reached its peak earlier than that of the aco gene . furthermore, when comparing the two soybean varieties, the expression of these two genes was observed earlier in the drought-tolerant cultivar. this fact could be evidence of ethylene participation in soybean responses to water stress.

the same analysis was performed with the genes coding ethylene receptors  and for the protein kinase ctr . few differences were observed in the expression patterns of the transcripts of these genes between the cultivars. in the roots of both cultivars, there was a reduction in the level of etr transcripts, comparing stressed and non-stressed plants. the maximal expression was achieved under the longest periods of stress. in the same tissue, the transcripts of ctr were reduced, with a significant increase detected only after 150 min of water deficit in both cultivars. in the leaves, when comparing the stress and no-stress conditions, we were able to observe a slight reduction in the levels of transcripts of etr in the first 125 min of drought and a peak elevation at the end of the analysis . relative to the ctr transcripts, it was observed that the expression of the drought-tolerant cultivar was higher in the non-stressed state .

levels of free acc and ethylene production
to compare and correlate the data obtained in silico with the physiological data, we assessed the levels of free acc and ethylene in both br <dig> and embrapa <dig> cultivars. the plants were grown under similar conditions as those used for the analysis of transcriptomes. the physiological data showed that both of the cultivars suffered under the water deficit but that the tolerant cultivar responded better, exhibiting increases in the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration after 75 min of stress . the water consumption  showed that before 75 min had elapsed, the sensitive cultivar was using its water resources better than the tolerant cultivar, but subsequently, the situation was reversed; thus, the stress caused a greater impact on the susceptible cultivar.

we analyzed the levels of free acc and ethylene production and found, in general terms, that free acc was mostly increased in the leaves, whereas ethylene was mostly increased in the roots . we observed that the embrapa <dig> cultivar had higher levels of free acc in the leaves and variable levels in the roots. in the roots of non-stressed plants , the free acc was higher in br <dig> plants, and the ethylene production was higher in the embrapa <dig> cultivar , whereas in the leaves, the level of free acc was the same in both cultivars, and the quantity of ethylene production was higher in embrapa <dig> . except for the period of 25– <dig> min of stress, it was observed that both free acc and ethylene production exhibited cyclic behavior in both the leaves and roots of br16: when free acc increased, ethylene decreased, and vice versa. additionally, in br <dig>  we found that in both tissues, the peak of ethylene production  corresponded to the lowest value of free acc. in the embrapa <dig> cultivar, this cyclic pattern was much less evident. we observed that the highest peaks of free acc were found after 75 min in the roots and after 125 min in the leaves, whereas the maximal production of ethylene corresponded to  <dig> and 150 min of stress, respectively. in the leaves, the maximal peak of ethylene production occurred at time zero.fig.  <dig> levels of ethylene production and free acc in soybean under drought stress conditions. values were determined for ethylene production and free acc  in roots and leaves of soybean cultivars br <dig> and embrapa <dig> after the application of different durations of drought stress. the codes a <dig> and a <dig> represent levels of free acc; b <dig> and b <dig> represent levels of ethylene production. the statistical analysis was performed by comparing similar tissues in both cultivars under the same conditions of drought stress . the asterisks represent the level of statistical significance:  p ≤  <dig> ;   <dig>  < p ≤  <dig> ;   <dig>  < p ≤  <dig> . each dot represents the average amount  of three replicates in different plants. the standard error is not presented with some dots because their absolute values are lower than the scale



when we compared the levels of ethylene production and free acc, two different situations were observed. first, an increase in free acc coincided with an increase in ethylene production. although the hydrolysis of acc aggregates remains contradictory, the high level of free acc could be explained by the degradation of these aggregates of malonyl-acc into free acc, accompanied by an increase in free acc production and the conversion of adomet into acc by the acs enzyme. thus, the levels of free acc would exceed the capacity of aco enzymes to convert it into ethylene, which would be present at its maximal level  <cit> . conversely, we observed a reduction of the levels of free acc, together with a reduction in ethylene production. this finding could be explained by the formation of malonyl-acc and glutamyl-acc, accompanied by the degradation of the ethylene precursor by acd enzymes. to support this conclusion, we simultaneously detected the differential expression of gmggt# <dig> in the roots and leaves of both cultivars and gmacd# <dig> in the roots of embrapa <dig>  to understand this trend better, it would be necessary to characterize the molecular pathways involved in acc conjugation and degradation in vitro and in vivo to determine the precise mechanisms underlying the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in response to diverse signals, in addition to the identification of the actual role of the formation of acc aggregates in this case.

in our work, transcriptome analysis, rt-qpcr and ethylene production revealed that ethylene synthesis depended on the tissue analyzed. after 75 min of water deficit, the maximal production of ethylene was observed in leaves of br <dig>  whereas after the same period of water deficit, in the leaves of embrapa <dig>  ethylene exhibited a significant decrease. in the roots, both cultivars had high levels of ethylene production . together with only the tolerant cultivar displaying an increase in stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate and transpiration after the same stress period , these findings indicated that in this situation, leaves and roots undertake different responses to ethylene. additionally, we can suggest that in the leaves, ethylene production could be associated with the response to drought stress because ethylene could regulate stomatal closure  <cit> .

nonetheless, studies have shown that the levels of this phytohormone are low when plants are exposed to water deficit  <cit> . these conflicting observations could be attributed to the system in which the soybean plants were grown. the plants were grown hydroponically, with the roots submerged in a nutrient-containing solution. some studies have shown that variations in gene expression could occur when hydroponic and soil cultures were compared  <cit> . thus, it is believed that hydroponically grown roots have molecular responses similar to those of roots grown under flooding conditions and that when subjected to water deficit, they exhibit molecular responses different from those shown by roots grown via soil culture.

additionally, other works have reported that in plants grown under flooding conditions, the levels of ethylene production were higher than those obtained under water deficit conditions  <cit> . we also believe that a natural elevation of the temperature caused by rapid water loss could be explained by an increase in ethylene biosynthesis because the activity of enzymes was also rapidly increased, as shown by antunes and sfakiotakis  <cit> . because ethylene diffusion is more rapid in the air than in liquid  and because water deficit and dehydration are more rapid under hydroponic conditions, we believe that the plants do not have sufficient time to begin molecular responses before desiccation occurs. one explanation could be that when short intervals of water deficit  are applied, ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction remain similar to those under normal growing conditions. therefore, when the stress duration is increased, the signal transduction could be strongly decreased. in fact, the plants were switched from flooding stress to water deficit stress, possibly activating different responses that substituted for the normal water deficit responses because we observed the differential expression of many genes even before the stress was administered. thus, the analysis of the genosoja database would be best complemented by next-generation sequencing experiments to replace the ssh methodology and cultivation in pot systems, instead of under hydroponic conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study was the first to propose accurate models for ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in the soybean. based on the currently available databases, soybean genes and proteins homologous to almost all of the components of the pathways featured in a. thaliana were identified, with the exception of the etp gene. the cis-acting elements present in soybean putative promoters were described to infer possible models and the regulation of signaling pathways linked directly to ethylene as well as their communication with other metabolic routes. rt-qpcr experiments were important to the validation of soybean transcriptome data and allowed for the evaluation of the induction kinetics of acs and aco soybean genes. finally, changes were observed in the levels of production of ethylene and its precursor  in soybean cultivars under water stress conditions.

by the integration of all data, many inferences could be made, among which the involvement of ethylene in soybean water stress responses stands out. furthermore, this work showed that regulation of the ethylene-mediated response could be influenced by diverse exogenous and endogenous factors, indicating that the balance of these various factors determines the quality and intensity of different stimuli responses. further studies are necessary to continue elucidating in vivo molecular mechanisms involved in ethylene coordination in soybean both to confirm our observations and to facilitate biotechnological strategies for the improvement of cultivar tolerance to various stresses.
