BACKGROUND
plant cell wall and the cytoskeleton control plant polarity and morphogenesis  <cit> . they determine cell shapes and control the fate of cells during cell differentiation. to better understand mechanisms, which regulate plant polarity and morphogenesis, it is very important to get a deeper knowledge about the functional architecture of the cell wall during cell shape acquisition and cell differentiation. somatic embryogenesis requires strict spatio-temporal control over cell division and elongation/differentiation  <cit> . the polarity within the embryo is established through the precisely controlled cell division pattern of embryogenic cells  and elongation of supporting suspensor-like and callus cells. the cell wall appears to play an essential structural role during somatic embryogenesis  <cit> .

cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin polysaccharides and structural proteins have been considered as the most abundant cell wall components. the major classes of cell wall proteins are arabinogalactan-proteins , hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins , proline-rich proteins  and glycine-rich proteins. extensins represent a well studied sub-family of hrgps  <cit> . they have been implicated in nearly all aspects of plant growth and development including cell division and differentiation  <cit> . some extensins were also proposed to be involved in the plant response to biotic  <cit>  and abiotic stresses  <cit> . additionally, extensins were implicated to have a role in the development of zygotic embryos in maize , arabidopsis and tobacco   <cit> . to gain deeper insight in the possible functions of hrgps in somatic embryogenesis, it is very important to localize them, and to study their biological function during somatic embryo development. however, to our knowledge, there are no reports about hrgp localization and function in somatic embryos of higher plants.

antibodies represent one of the most useful probes for the study of plant cell walls, on the biochemical as well as on the structural levels in light and electron microscopy  <cit> . tremendous progress has been made in the precise determination of cellular and subcellular distribution of cell wall components using diverse polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. among them, jim <dig> and jim <dig> recognize specific arabinosylation motifs of hrgps such as extensins and solanaceous lectins  <cit> . these antibodies were successfully used to study the distributions of extensins during plant developmental processes, such as pericycle and vascular tissue development  <cit> , zygotic embryo development  <cit>  but also during plant-microbe interactions  <cit> . in the present study, developmental immunolocalization of jim <dig> and jim <dig> epitopes was performed during somatic embryogenesis of banana .

to study function of hrgps, two main methods have been used to alter their content in the cell wall. the first one is a transgenic approach, which has been employed to study the effect of changes in hrgp gene expression level on the plant phenotype  <cit> . the other one is to use chemicals such as  <dig> -dhp  which inhibits biosynthesis of hrgps. most of the proline  residues in hrgps are hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases and the resulting hydroxyproline  residues serve as major sites for o-glycosidic oligosaccharide decoration  <cit> . thus,  <dig> -dhp, as a potent inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase, has been used to alter hrgps in plant cell walls and thereafter to study the biological function of extensins  <cit> .

in the present study, embryogenic cultures of banana were treated with  <dig> -dhp or hrgp epitopes were immuno-modulated with the jim <dig> antibody to affect hrgps in the cell wall and to test the biological function of these glycoproteins during somatic embryo development.

RESULTS
expression pattern of hrgps in ecs, necs and somatic embryos of different developmental stages
immunoblots were used to detect the expression of hrgps in necs, ecs and embryos of different developmental stages by using monoclonal anti-hrgp antibodies jim <dig> and jim <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  there was negligible signal of jim <dig> in necs, while there was a strong signal in ecs, globular embryos and especially in late-stage embryos . the jim <dig> epitope was moderately expressed in embryogenic tissues while only very low expression was detected in necs . the signal of jim <dig> in later-stage embryos was relatively weaker than that found in embryos at globular stage . there were two major hrgp bands in ecs and tissues with molecular weight of around  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively . these immunoblot results were corroborated by immunofluorescence labelling data.

immunolocalization of hrgps in necs, ecs and somatic embryos of different developmental stages
necs, ecs and somatic embryos at different developmental stages were labelled with monoclonal anti-hrgp antibodies jim <dig> and jim <dig>  these results revealed that the fluorescence signal of jim <dig> epitope was generally very weak in the necs. moderate fluorescence signal was found only at the surface of cell aggregates . on the contrary, much stronger fluorescence was found in ecs, especially in the cell wall and cytoplasm around the nucleus, but mostly no signal was detected at the surface of cell groups . in young pro-embryos, there was a very strong fluorescence layer at the cell surface but only moderate fluorescence inside the cells . with the development of the somatic embryos, the fluorescence layer covering embryonic epidermis became thinner, however, new and strong fluorescence signal appeared in the cells within the embryo. detailed study revealed that the jim <dig> epitope was abundant in the cell walls and especially in the tricellular junctions of the inner cortical cells . the negative controls showed almost no labelling of ecs  and somatic embryo . when compared to jim <dig>  there was slightly stronger signal of jim <dig> in necs, which was mostly located in the cell walls . the immunolabelling results of jim <dig> in ecs and pro-embryos were similar to those of jim <dig> . nevertheless, in comparison to jim <dig> there was always relatively strong signal of jim <dig> at the surface of ec groups . moreover, the jim <dig> signal in late stage embryos was weaker than that of jim <dig> . again, negative controls showed only very negligible unspecific signal .

an overview of immunolabelling of jim <dig> and jim <dig> epitopes in different cell types and embryogenic stages is summarized in table  <dig> 

necs: non-embryogenic cells; ecs: embryogenic cells. increasing intensity was evaluated as: ± , + , ++ , +++ , ++++ .

effect of  <dig> -dhp treatment and immunomodulation by jim <dig> antibody on the growth, development and regeneration of somatic embryos
to target hrgps/extensins more specifically,  <dig> -dhp was added directly into rd <dig> embryo regeneration medium. one week after transfer of ecs on the rd <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> -dhp, many small cell aggregates showed necrosis , unlike to fully viable cell colonies in the control . about two weeks later, some cells gradually recovered. at the end of culture on the rd <dig> medium, embryo-cultures were light brown  while fresh weight was significantly reduced if compared to the control . brown and black colour  in  <dig> -dhp treated cultures increased on rd <dig> medium . simultaneously with this phenomenon, both embryo germination and plant regeneration capacity were significantly lower in  <dig>  4-dhp treated cultures as compared to the control .

ecs: embryogenic cells. the data in the table represent an average of four biological replicates ± standard deviation. a comparison of groups was conducted using a paired t-test of variance. values marked with star were considered significant at p <  <dig>  while values marked with two stars were considered significant at p <  <dig> 

to evaluate an effect of  <dig> -dhp on the distribution and localization of hrgps in somatic embryos, immunolabelling with jim <dig> antibody was carried out on embryos grown on rd <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> -dhp. some of these embryos showed slightly less labelling with the jim <dig> antibody when compared to the control. most importantly, epidermis of embryos treated with  <dig> -dhp was disorganized and the fluorescent layer representing ecm at the surface of these embryos disappeared when compared to the control .

finally, somatic embryos were surface-treated with jim <dig> antibody to immunomodulate hrgp epitopes in the ecm. these embryos were subsequently transferred to rd <dig> and reg media for maturation and germination. at the end of culture on the rd <dig> medium, antibody-treated embryo-cultures were light brown to black while this was not the case with the control showing mostly white or yellow colour of embryos . subsequently, fewer plants were obtained from the same amount of antibody-treated embryos when compared to the control . statistically significant differences were found between the control and antibody treatment, showing germination efficiency of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively .

ecs: embryogenic cells. the data in the table represent an average of four biological replicates ± standard deviation. a comparison of groups was conducted using a paired t-test of variance. values marked with star were considered significant at p <  <dig>  while values marked with two stars were considered significant at p <  <dig> 

discussion
hrgps represent a major protein component of plant cell walls  <cit> . they are rich in hydroxyproline but also in serine, lysine, tyrosine, and valine residues, and they contain arabinose and galactose in the attached oligosaccharide chains  <cit> . extensins represent a subfamily of hrgps. in contrast to dicotyledonous plant species, the extensin subfamily of monocotyledonous plants is relatively simpler. they are rich in threonine or histidine rather than serine, and hence they are called threonine- or histidine-hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins   <cit> . moreover, extensins of dicots are highly glycosylated, contain 50-60%  of carbohydrate and form a left-handed polyproline ii helix while extensins of monocots are less glycosylated and exist in a random coil conformation  <cit> .

monoclonal antibodies jim <dig> and jim <dig> recognize specific arabinosylation patterns of hrpgs such as extensins and solanaceous lectins but not those of arabinogalactan proteins  <cit> . since banana also contain lectins  <cit>  it is possible that jim <dig> and jim <dig> antibodies recognize except extensins also these lectins. the jim <dig> and jim <dig> antibodies were used previously to study extensin, extensin-like and hrgp epitopes in diverse dicotyledonous plants  <cit>  but also in green alga  <cit>  and green seaweed  <cit> . in monocotyledonous species such as onion, jim <dig> and jim <dig> extensin epitopes were localized to rhizodermis, exodermis, endodermis, pericycle and phloem of primary root as well as to the root surface . here, to our knowledge for the first time, the localization and function of jim <dig> and jim <dig> hrgp epitopes were studied during somatic embryogenesis of banana, a very important monocot fruit and crop.

in monocotyledonous maize, the mrna of hrgp accumulates in young organs rich in dividing cells but it decreased in mature tissues  <cit> . moreover, it showed a specific pattern of expression in immature embryos  <cit> . further study revealed that the accumulation of this mrna occurred early during cell differentiation and before acquisition of the final cell wall structure  <cit> . in the present study we showed that ecs of banana contained hrgp epitopes recognized by jim <dig> and jim <dig> antibodies. thus, these epitopes might serve as good markers of embryogenic competence in ecs. during embryo development from ecs, the same jim <dig> and jim <dig> epitopes were abundant at the surface of proembryos and globular embryos. they were likely associated with the proper adhesion and monolayer formation of embryo epidermis. in late-stage embryos, however, the jim <dig> and jim20-positive signal was stronger in inner cortical and vascular tissues. we also showed that developmental distribution and subcellular localization of these surface-located hrgp epitopes were affected by  <dig> -dhp treatment, which led to the disintegration of the ecm and disaggregation of the epidermis . particularly important was finding that both immunomodulation with jim <dig> antibody as well as treatment with  <dig> -dhp negatively affected and reduced embryo formation and germination as well as plant regeneration capacity from banana somatic embryos. altogether, these data suggest that developmentally regulated hrgp proteins are essential for development, germination and regeneration of banana somatic embryos. similar results were recently reported by zhang et al.  <cit>  on tobacco zygotic embryo development. these authors suggested that extensins reacting to the same antibodies jim <dig> and jim <dig> play important roles in the cotyledon primordium formation, in the activity of the shoot apical meristem and in vascular differentiation during embryo development.

although there are many differences between hrgps and extensins of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species, there are still some similarities between them. there are few reports about similar localization of extensin epitopes in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species. for example, in rice , jim <dig> and jim <dig> antibodies raised against extensins from dicotyledonous plant species labelled the root tissues in the same pattern as the lm <dig> antibody  <cit>  which was derived against extensins from rice  <cit> . monocot barley and rice protoplasts contain jim <dig> and jim <dig> extensin-like epitopes  <cit> , while there were both similarities and differences to the labelling pattern detected in dicot pea  <cit> . here we show that jim <dig> and jim <dig> antibodies prepared against extracts from dicotyledonous plants such as carrot and pea, respectively  <cit>  could recognize hrgps in banana.

interestingly, synthetic decapeptide matching the c-terminal sequence of inversion-specific glycoprotein , a hrgp from algae closely related to the extensins from higher plants, was able to disaggregate alga into individual cells  <cit>  and this isg was likely involved in the early processes of ecm biogenesis. little is known about chemical composition, biogenesis and function of ecm at the surface of somatic embryos  <cit> , especially in monocot plant species. in maize, the ecm contains agp and pectin epitopes  <cit> . here, we found, to our knowledge for the first time, jim <dig> and jim <dig> hrgp epitopes in the ecm covering outer surface of banana somatic embryos while this ecm was disrupted by treatment with  <dig> -dhp.

CONCLUSIONS
immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed two hrgp epitopes jim <dig> and jim <dig> in ecs and in various developmental stages of banana somatic embryos. interestingly, these epitopes were found also in the ecm at the surface of embryogenic cells. treatment with extensin inhibitor  <dig> -dhp depleted surface-localized jim <dig> and jim <dig> epitopes and also disrupted ecm. additionally, both treatment with  <dig> -dhp and immunomodulation with jim <dig> antibody showed similar negative effects on the embryo development, germination and plant regeneration. these data suggest that proper developmental regulation and surface localization of hrgps in ecm were essential for the embryo development and plant regeneration. future studies should be devoted to the molecular identification and cloning of hrgps involved in banana somatic embryogenesis.
