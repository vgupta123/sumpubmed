BACKGROUND
metzincins are a superfamily of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases that include the matrix metalloproteinases , the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain  and the a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin- <dig> motifs  enzyme families. metzincins are represented across prokaryotes and unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . all metzincins share the zinc-binding catalytic motif consensus sequence hexxhxxgxx , whereby the three histidines  coordinate the binding of a zinc molecule, the glutamic acid residue facilitates general acid–base catalysis and the small glycine residue allows for steric flexibility within the catalytic motif  <cit> . the first role for a metzincin was discovered while examining mechanisms of morphogenesis in tadpoles where collagenase  activity was found to contribute to the tail fin resorption  <cit>  but they are now known to contribute to a vast array of biological processes  <cit> .

the adamts genes encode secreted enzymes that remodel the extracellular matrix ; they play roles in cell-cell interactions such as cell signalling and fusion, as well as developmental morphogenesis in mammals and annelids  <cit> . there are  <dig> adamts genes in human, designated adamts <dig> through adamts <dig>  where adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> represent the same gene  <cit> . the functional subdivisions of the  <dig> members are based on common affinities towards preferred substrates. the evolution of several adamts genes has previously been reported across various species including the fugu, the urochordate ciona intestinalis, and the invertebrates drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . these studies have underscored the importance of adamts enzymes throughout vertebrate evolution including the rapid expansion of this gene family concomitant with the emergence of chordates and vertebrates  <cit> . however, in light of the rapid advancement of sequences now available across vertebrates and beyond, an up-to-date analysis of the evolution of this gene family is now required.

moreover, the complexity of understanding the cooperative adamts biology in rodent models of development  <cit>  means additional vertebrate models are required to further elucidate adamts biology during embryogenesis. zebrafish has emerged as a popular model to study vertebrate embryonic development with well conserved gastrulation, somitogenesis and organogenesis  <cit> , which generates a body plan showing strong parallels to rodents and human  <cit> .

in this current study, we undertook a detailed analysis of the evolutionary history of adamts through the three major rounds of whole genome duplications  across vertebrate species using up-to-date genomic dna databases supplemented with additional sequences from other repositories. we also examined the expression pattern of zebrafish adamts genes in the developing embryo and adult organs. our analyses highlight key events in adamts gene evolution, providing insight into their roles throughout the emergence, and then divergence of vertebrates. collectively, our study highlights the evolution of the metzincin-superfamily of zinc-peptidases and conservation of adamts protein sequences, and suggests the zebrafish as an attractive model to dissect adamts biology throughout vertebrate development, with potential applications in pathological contexts.

RESULTS
the initial aim of this study was to understand the evolution of adamts genes through the  <dig> whole genome duplication  events in vertebrates  <cit> . adamts proteins share a common structure with distinct modules, including a propeptide region, a metallopeptidase m12b domain, a disintegrin-like and a thrombospondin  type- <dig> domain followed by a spacer . with the exception of adamts <dig>  which lacks additional c-terminal domains, all other members contain from  <dig> up to  <dig> additional tsp type- <dig> domains. these can form the c-terminus for adamts <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> or that can be in addition to other domains, those being plac for  <dig> adamts , a gon- <dig> domain for adamts <dig> and − <dig>  or a cub domain for adamts <dig> .figure  <dig> 
structural relationships amongst adamts proteins
. all adamts proteins share a common protease domain including the peptidase m12b and its active site, and a disintegrin-like, thrombospondin  type- <dig> and cysteine-rich domain. ancillary  domains are variable among the genes as indicated.



phylogenetic analyses  showed that adamts proteins are clustered into clades that match their structural subdivisions. these are: adamts <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig>  which lack a plac domain and are known as the retrotransposed angiogenesis-aggrecanase group  <cit>  ; adamts <dig> and − <dig> ; adamts <dig> and − <dig> ; adamts <dig> and − <dig> ; adamts <dig> and − <dig> ; adamts <dig> and − <dig> ; adamts <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> , a group known as the procollagen amino propeptidases  <cit> ; and adamts <dig> . all of these groups were rooted by a single gene in either ciona  and/or amphioxus, or even from another branch of the deuterostomia, the echinodermata sea urchin s. purpuratus . adamts <dig> was found in a single copy in both sarcopterygii and actinopterygii species with these orthologous proteins clustered into an independent monophyletic group . thus, all genes except adamts <dig> remained duplicated at least once during the  <dig> successive wgds, which occurred at the base of vertebrate evolution.figure  <dig>

there were sets of two paralogous copies that were all rooted by one gene in non-vertebrate deuterostomian species: adamts <dig> and − <dig>  adamts <dig> and − <dig>  adamts <dig> and − <dig>  adamts <dig> and − <dig>  and adamts <dig> and − <dig> . the dichotomic phylogenetic pattern they present is the signature of a duplication process that most likely occurred through either the 1r- or 2r-wgd, with no additional duplication in the teleost-specific 3r-wgd . further, each of these pairs of paralogues share the common structure of all adamts proteins; adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> have an additional four tsp type- <dig> domains ending with a plac domain, a structure also found in adamts <dig> and its paralogue adamts <dig>  adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> have  <dig> and  <dig> tsp type- <dig> domains, respectively also ending with a plac domain. adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> have a similar structure with  <dig> tsp type- <dig> domains, a large spacer domain, four other tsp type- <dig> domains and a plac domain. adamts <dig> and − <dig> are the two longest adamts proteins with  <dig> additional tsp type- <dig> domains and a large gon domain to end the c-terminal region . of note, the gene encoding adamts <dig> was lost along the lineage leading to teleosteans, as it is not found in these fish, with the interesting caveat that it is observed in the gar genome  .figure  <dig>

the procollagen amino-propeptidases adamts <dig>  adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> also share a same common structure with three additional tsp type- <dig> domains ending by a plac domain . these three paralogues form a monophyletic group rooted together by orthologous proteins from non-vertebrate deuterostomes. in contrast to other family members, adamts <dig> is found in two copies in each teleostean species, but only one copy in the non-teleost spotted gar, and also in the coelacanth and all tetrapod species . the dichotomy found in the phylogeny is the pattern expected for the teleostean fish specific 3r-wgd. adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> are phylogenetically closer to each other than to adamts <dig>  indicating that their corresponding genes were most probably duplicated through the 1r- and 2r-wgd, with the counterpart of adamts <dig> being lost after the second vertebrate wgd .figure  <dig>

the last group of adamts comprises adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  adamts <dig> and adamts <dig>  a single gene copy in the two urochordates roots all these vertebrate members . the phylogeny of these family members is complicated by an additional tandem duplication that has likely occurred early in the vertebrate evolution, most parsimoniously between the 1r- and 2r-wgd, as evident by adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> lying in a tail-to-head tandem configuration, and adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> lying in tail-to-tail tandem . adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> share the same structure with only one additional tsp type- <dig> domain ending the c-terminal region, while the two other members of the tandem duplications have  <dig> additional tsp type- <dig> domains. by contrast adamts <dig> has no extra domain to end the c-terminal region after the spacer region . thus, the ancestral  gene encoding this clade was duplicated during the 1r-wgd, one of the two copies went on to be duplicated in tandem before the occurrence of the 2r-wgd. in addition, it gained or lost one tsp-encoding sequence. the gene that lost its duplicate after that is adamts <dig>  as for the two tandem duplicates, one of the duplicates was inverted, ending in a different orientation . adamts <dig> was lost in the actinopterygii lineage  but kept in the sarcopterygii from the coelacanth to all tetrapods . after the occurrence of the teleostean 3r-wgd, one of the copies of the tandem adamts1-adamts <dig> was lost. the other tandem adamts8-adamts <dig> remained duplicated in the lineage leading to the ostariophysii  found in the zebrafish and the cave fish , but adamts8b was lost in the lineage leading to the percomorpha. altogether in this clade, there are  <dig> adamts in the sarcopterygii , and among fish,  <dig> in percomorpha and  <dig> in ostariophysii.

based on the alignment of the peptidase m12b, the disintegrin-like, the first tsp-type- <dig> and the cysteine-rich domains, phylogenetic analyses were performed and phylogenetic trees drawn at the same scale, which revealed some interesting features. a strong acceleration of the evolutionary pace of the adamts <dig> proteins has occurred in the branch leading to the primates . a strong increase in the evolutionary pace is also observed in the branch leading to the therian for adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> . adamts2a and adamts2b are evolving faster than their tetrapod counterparts, with a stronger acceleration of adamts2a compared to adamts2b in the percomorpha lineage . adamts <dig> is strongly constrained, with the opposite being true for adamts <dig>  which has the fastest evolutionary rate .

evolution of adamts among opisthokonta
the next aim of this study was to elucidate the evolutionary origin of all adamts utilizing the data available in the non-vertebrate opisthokonta, including insects or nematodes, that are ecdysozoan species, or lophotrochozoans , and even non-bilaterian species like the cnidaria nematostella vectensis. only one sequence was retrieved in the porifera, i.e. the sponge amphimedon queenslandica, which was used to root the phylogenetic tree . all but three groups of adamts in vertebrates were in a monophyletic group shared with some adamts genes found in either the ecdysozoa or the lophotrochozoa . the first exception was adamts <dig>  which encodes two cub domains, a novelty probably acquired by domain shuffling at the base of the deuterostomian lineage from the procollagen amino-propeptidases-encoding adamts2/3/ <dig> . this scenario is consistent with an occurrence of a protein in the starlet sea anemone  that can be annotated as adamts2/3/ <dig> . the second exception is the group of adamts1/4/5/8/ <dig> proteins, with a homologue found in ciona, and a short sequence in the amphioxus . thus, this group of genes was acquired somewhere in the deuterostomian lineage leading to the chordata . given that adamts9/ <dig> belong to the same monophyletic group of both lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans, the retroposition event most likely originated from the long adamts9/ <dig>  a scenario more probable due to the fact that all of these genes are rooted by a cnidaria sequence . the last group is adamts6/ <dig>  which clusters with a very low bootstrap value with adamts7/ <dig>  adamts16/ <dig> and adamts17/ <dig>  therefore, a duplication of any of these in the bilaterian lineage could be a plausible evolutionary scenario .

the adamts family is dynamically expressed throughout zebrafish embryonic development
based on the detailed analysis of the evolutionary relationship of the adamts family across vertebrate species, it became of interest to scope the potential of zebrafish as a model to study roles of adamts enzymes in development. therefore, q-rt-pcr was performed on rna extracted from staged zebrafish embryos to determine the expression profile of the adamts family, that revealed dynamic and overlapping expression patterns . notably, with the exception of adamts <dig>  all members of the family detected during embryogenesis were maternally derived with amplicons representing mrna expression found at the one cell-stage. with the consideration of maternal mrna instability in mind however, it is important to note that full-length maternally derived encoding mrna transcripts for each adamts gene detected were not confirmed at this stage. in most cases adamts mrna species were however upregulated at 8 hours post fertilization  indicative of zygotic expression with adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> increasing 5-fold or greater; adamts8a, adamts8b, adamts <dig>  adamts <dig> increasing 10-fold or greater, and; adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> increasing 100-fold or greater . during somitogenesis  noticeable increases in mrna expression were observed for adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  adamts15a, adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> . all adamts members detected showed significantly increased mrna expression at  <dig> hpf coinciding with the onset of organogenesis . in contrast, mrna transcripts for adamts <dig> were not detected despite attempts with several sets of dna oligonucleotide primers and varying rt-pcr conditions . however, there is strong bioinformatics evidence of its presence in the zebrafish genome .figure  <dig>

adamts15a and adamts <dig> are specifically expressed in craniofacial and neural structures respectively during zebrafish embryonic development
there is currently no report of an adamts <dig> knockout mouse, and the adamts <dig> knockout mouse is embryonic lethal at gastrulation, making the zebrafish a prime candidate to study their roles in development. therefore, whole-mount in situ hybridisation was performed for adamts15a and adamts <dig> to obtain a snapshot of the expression pattern of two key members of the proteoglycanase clade of adamts enzymes. adamts <dig> was specifically expressed in neuronal tissue at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, in the cerebellum and rhombic lip respectively , and was also found in the ventral region of the otic vesicle at  <dig> hpf . for adamts15a, expression could be seen in the hyoid  at  <dig> hpf with additional expression in the 1st arch  from  <dig> hpf through to  <dig> hpf .figure  <dig>

the adamts family is widely expressed in zebrafish adult organs
further analysis of adamts expression in adult zebrafish by rt-pcr revealed a wide distribution across different organs  suggesting a role for those genes in normal adult organ function. subsequent q-rt-pcr performed across organs revealed some interesting expression patterns. high levels of expression were seen in the liver for adamts2a, adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  adamts8a, adamts <dig>  adamts15a, adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> . adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> were most highly expressed in skeletal muscle but both essentially absent in the liver. adamts <dig> was also highly expressed in the eye . the brain had representative transcripts for most adamts genes with notably high expression in the case of adamts <dig> . adamts15a was the most highly expressed gene in several organs including skeletal muscle, eye, thymus, heart, liver, kidney and gut .figure  <dig>

discussion
this report describes a significantly updated evolutionary understanding of adamts metzincins across vertebrate species compared with previous studies  <cit> . the initial motivation of this work was to check whether each of these genes had an orthologue in the zebrafish and/or the medaka, two fish species that represent two major species groups that diverged about  <dig> millions of years ago  and circa  <dig> mya, respectively  <cit> . given that the vertebrate lineage experienced two wgds at its base  <cit>  and a third wgd specific to the fish teleost species  <cit> , it was of interest to determine how many ohnologues  could be found in these fish compared to human, and, whether the evolutionary scenario of the adamts in the metazoans could be elucidated. the adamts family, composed of  <dig> genes in the human and mouse, has expanded dramatically during the course of metazoa evolution starting from one single gene in the common ancestor with the sponge, more than  <dig> mya  <cit> , up to  <dig> in the non-vertebrate chordates . future releases of genomes in species may lead to slight modifications in the proposed scenario at deeper animal nodes; however, the conservative approach used here should minimize them.

the 1r-and 2r-wgds have substantially impacted this gene family in the vertebrate lineage expanding its numbers to  <dig>  interestingly, the teleost specific 3r-wgd did not have a significant impact on the number of adamts genes as the duplicates retained  may be compensating the general teleostean losses of adamts <dig> and adamts <dig>  albeit that adamts <dig> is still found in the gar.

in general, phylogenetic trees demonstrated very similar patterns of branching and branch lengths across adamts genes. the first exceptions are teleost adamts2a and adamts2b that both have very long branches compared to the tetrapod orthologue adamts <dig> indicating the former two are rapidly evolving possibly gaining divergent functions, a pattern of sub-functionalization. the second is adamts <dig>  which has a very distinctive branch in the primates, suggesting specific divergence.

we previously reported the remarkable conservation of certain adamts members  at the primary amino acid level  <cit> . ancestral adamts gene function has been previously reported in early evolution with c. elegans gon- <dig> shown to mediate distal tip migration during gonadal morphogenesis  <cit> . moreover, adamts knockout mice show profound developmental defects demonstrating their unquestionable importance during vertebrate embryonic development.

adamts <dig> knockout mice have reduced rates of ovulation and impaired fertility as well as abnormally remodelled ovarian follicular basement membranes  <cit> . we found a low abundance of adamts <dig> transcript in oocytes but did not investigate its abundance in follicular somatic cells in this current study, although its presence has been previously reported in teleost fish follicular somatic cells  <cit> . therefore it may have similar roles in the ovulatory process across vertebrate species.

during limb development, reduced interdigital tissue resorption leading to soft tissue syndactyly  occurred in combinatorial adamts <dig>  adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> knockout mice and mesodermal prx- <dig> cre conditionally deleted adamts <dig>   <cit> . in this current study, adamts <dig>  adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> were abundant in adult zebrafish skeletal muscle and we previously reported a role for adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> during myogenesis and muscle regeneration  <cit> .

cardiac and aortic abnormalities including the appearance of ectopic chondrogenic nodules and myxomatous heart valves were observed in heterozygous  mice  <cit>  and myxomatous heart valves were also observed in adamts5−/− mice. both adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> were expressed in the adult mice hearts, although whole-mount in situ hybridisation for adamts <dig> did not reveal clearly discernable expression in the zebrafish heart at the developmental time-points examined in this study. however, in adult zebrafish hearts, adamts <dig> and adamts15a were strongly expressed suggesting a role for these two genes in normal heart function.

adamts9−/−  knockout mice were embryonic lethal, dying around gastrulation  <cit>  and its expression was found in mesoderm near the optic vesicle and in the common ventricle in the mouse  <cit> . this current study showed strong expression of adamts <dig> in the zebrafish adult eye and developing otic vesicle, and consistent with the mouse, in the primitive central nervous system including the rhombic lip and presumptive cerebellum.

interestingly, single adamts <dig> knockout mice have no apparent phenotype although when knocked out combinatorially with adamts <dig>  mice die of post-natal renal failure  <cit> ; the current study shows adamts <dig> is absent in the zebrafish genome, collectively suggesting adamts <dig> to be less important during vertebrate development, whereas adamts <dig> was strongly expressed in zebrafish kidney. several adamts genes were highly expressed in the adult zebrafish liver, however roles for adamts enzymes in liver function are largely unreported with the exception of a report of their expression correlating with liver fibrosis  <cit> .

we recently reported the expression of adamts <dig> during mouse embryogenesis  <cit> ; however, there is currently no report of an adamts <dig> knockout mouse. in this current study, we showed specific expression of adamts15a in the first and second pharyngeal arches of the zebrafish, suggesting a role during craniofacial development. while little is known about adamts <dig> in mouse craniofacial development, adamts <dig> is expressed in meckel’s cartilage in the developing mouse embryo  <cit> , while adamts <dig> is expressed in branchial arches i and ii in the mouse  <cit> . each of these enzymes have overlapping substrate specificity towards versican, a widely expressed transitional matrix proteoglycan  <cit> . therefore it is attractive to hypothesise, given the cooperative nature of the adamts family that more prominent roles for any given family member could arise through divergent evolution.

in each of the adamts proteoglycanase  knockout mice outlined above versican remodelling is markedly reduced or essentially absent in areas relevant to their phenotypes. the zebrafish genome possesses two confirmed versican homologues: versican  and dermacan   <cit>  and one computationally predicted versican homologue . the putative zebrafish versicans  both represent only a small portion of mammalian versican, comprising just a g <dig> globular domain. however, this domain is known to mediate important cellular events such as proliferation, and both resistance and sensitivity to apoptosis during tumourigenesis  <cit> . dermacan, on the other hand, shows homology to all regions of full-length human versican  including the n-terminal region proteolytically processed by mammalian adamts proteoglycanases . although the specific adamts–mediated versican cleavage site reported: dpeaae↓a  <cit>  is not conserved in the zebrafish, an alternatively conserved cleavage site: vaeqe↓a is present. whether adamts-mediated remodelling of dermacan is apparent in the zebrafish throughout development requires further investigation, although dermacan expression overlaps with adamts <dig> expression in zebrafish craniofacial development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data highlight the evolution of the adamts gene family through recurrent events of single gene duplication processes across metazoans with by a burst of amplification through vertebrate wgd events. in contrast, the wgd event that occurred at the base of the teleostean fish did not impact much the total number of this gene family in fish compared to other vertebrates. adamts enzymes are highly conserved across vertebrate species, dynamically expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis and widely expressed in its adult organs. given the incontrovertible role of some adamts enzymes, and in particular the proteoglycanases during murine embryonic development, it is likely that similar and additional roles exist in the developing zebrafish embryo. the zebrafish therefore represents an additional powerful model to further our knowledge regarding the underlying complexities of adamts enzyme biology in development and disease. it is also expected to help in understanding the increasing complexity and specialisation of functions of these enzymes during evolution since our common ancestor with sponges.
