BACKGROUND
time series experiments have been widely used to study the dynamic behavior of the cells in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation  <cit> , development  <cit> , and response to extracellular stimuli  <cit> . time series data can be broadly divided into two classes: the short-time series with few sampled time points  and long-time series with more than  <dig> time points sampled. most algorithms used to analyze time series datasets initially were based on general clustering methods like hierarchical clustering  <cit> , k-means  <cit> , bayesian networks  <cit> , and self-organizing maps  <cit> . although these methods are capable of revealing some biological features, they are not taking into consideration the sequential nature of the time series data. more recently, some groups suggested methodologies specifically designed for clustering time series expression data, including the use of continuous representation of expression profiles  <cit> , hidden markov models  <cit> , and others  <cit> . however, algorithms such as those developed by bar-joseph et al.  <cit> , de hoon et al.  <cit>  and peddada et al.  <cit>  perform better on long time series datasets where the statistical power is higher. for short time series data, which represent about 80% of the time series gene expression datasets  <cit> , they are expected to perform less optimal due to data overfitting caused by the small number of sampled time points.

in order to avoid that, some researchers have suggested the use of predefined patterns of expression profiles  and matching the observed data to these profiles using some cost function  <cit> . such approaches usually identify a large number of patterns, but many of them may arise randomly from noise due to the small number of sampled time points. the algorithm proposed by ernst et al.  <cit>  is capable of partially correcting for this problem with the implementation of heuristics: the user is required to select a set of potential profiles that are expected to represent better the real biological nature of such data. last but not least, almost all of the approaches mentioned above use a cost function followed by a greedy algorithm to find clusters. as we will show later, such approaches may miss some biologically significant characteristics of the data.

in this paper, we present two new algorithms, astro and mimesr, respectively, which are specifically designed to identify biologically relevant clusters of genes from short time series data. astro and mimesr are inspired by the order preserving framework and the minimum mean squared residue approach, respectively. other algorithms have used the same principles in the past, but in the biclustering context  <cit> , which makes such algorithms np hard  <cit> . we demonstrate the utility of astro and mimesr using several well-defined short time datasets. we show that our approaches are robust to noise and random patterns and they can correctly detect the temporal expression profile of relevant functional categories in linear time. comparative analysis also showed that our approaches outperform both general clustering algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for short time series gene expression data.

RESULTS
robustness to noise
to test the robustness of astro and mimesr to noise, we generated three sets of data,  <dig> rows and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> time points respectively, with five order preserving submatrix which at the same time verify the minimum mean squared residue property embedded in it . then, we added 0%, 1%, 3%, and 5% level of noise into the simulated data. we ran each algorithm several times on each set of data and plot the average of the adjusted rand index . the adjusted rand index values lies between  <dig> and  <dig>  larger value means higher similarity between the clustering results. if the simulated result is perfectly consistent to the domain knowledge, the index value will be  <dig>  if a clustering is no more than a random choice, the index will be zero  <cit> . the results in figure  <dig> show that both algorithms perform equally well on the  <dig> time points dataset, while astro is more robust on the  <dig> time points datasets and mimesr on the  <dig> time points dataset.

application on saccharomyces cerevisiae amino acid starvation dataset
we tested the ability of astro and mimesr to identify biologically relevant clusters from short time series data using the yeast amino acid  starvation dataset  <cit> . saccharomyces cerevisiae response to stress by aa starvation is measured at time points  <dig>  h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h and at the control  cells . the data was filtered to remove genes with missing values and genes whose expression level did not change substantially between time points, filtering threshold Îµ <  <dig>  for astro and mimesr. the results show that both our approaches can correctly identify the temporal profiles of relevant functional groups. statistical evaluation of our clusters was performed using external datasets, like the go categories  <cit>  and aa starvation chip-chip data  <cit> . compared to general clustering algorithms  and algorithms designed specifically for clustering short time series gene expression data  <cit> , our techniques were able to detect more significant patterns.

evaluation using chip-chip data
another reasonable assumption is that genes that belong to the same cluster  are more likely to be regulated by the same transcription factors . we evaluated the astro and mimesr clusters using the published aa starvation chip-chip dataset on  <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . each of the  <dig> transcription factors in the chip-chip dataset was tested for target over-representation in each of the clusters using the fisher's exact test. the results are presented on tables  <dig>  and  <dig> . fhl <dig>  and sfp <dig> appear to have overrepresented number of target genes in clusters a <dig>  b <dig>  d <dig> , a <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig>  and g <dig> , which are also the most similar in their overall expression pattern , especially in  <dig>  hr and  <dig> hr time points. it is possible that these transcription factors act early on in the aa starvation response as it was previously suggested  <cit> . consistent with our results, jorgensen et al.  <cit>  have found that fhl <dig> and sfp <dig> regulate many ribosome biosynthesis genes, which is the most significant go process in cluster c <dig>  d <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  and f <dig> genes. furthermore, met <dig>  met <dig> and met <dig> have been associated with regulation of sulfur metabolism genes  <cit> , which is the most significant category for our cluster e <dig> genes.

comparison of the results in tables  <dig> and  <dig> also shows that in general astro finds more clusters that are statistically significantly enriched in genes bound by transcription factors. in other words, astro performs better than mimesr in identifying co-regulated genes.

comparison with other methods
we compared astro and mimesr with the popular k-means general clustering algorithm and the recently published stem  <cit>  and fcv  <cit> , both of which are designed specifically for short time series gene expression data. we used the matlab  <dig> . <dig> implementation of k-means with correlation distance. we ran the k-means algorithm for  <dig> clusters because most of our algorithm picked the same number. fcv was implemented according to the description provided in  <cit> . stem ran over the web  with the following parameters: maximum unit of change in model profiles between time points = 4; number of model profiles =  <dig>  for unbiased comparison, we ran these algorithms on the same dataset of  <dig> genes . we selected clusters with less than 50% genes of unknown function as depicted by the go database. figure 3a and 3b presents the comparative evaluation of these approaches using go and chip data, respectively. a particular cluster was considered to be "significant" if the p-value of the top go category or transcription factor-gene association was smaller than the threshold. a good clustering algorithm is expected to identify sets of genes that will participate in the same biological processes  and/or regulated by the same transcription factors. the more homogeneous these clusters are the more significant the annotation categories will become. astro identified a higher number of significant clusters than the k-means and the fcv algorithms in all p-value thresholds . also, it performed equally well or better when compared to stem. mimesr also performed equally well or better than all other algorithms with respect to the tf-gene association data; and it gave comparable results to the other algorithms in the go category analysis. in particular, we found it to be more accurate than the other algorithms in predicting the more tight clusters , whereas the other algorithms performed better in higher p-values. this shows the potential of our algorithms in identifying more tight, biologically relevant clusters. we note, however, that a thorough comparison of different methods is impossible when dealing with noisy datasets and algorithms with different reporting thresholds.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we presented two new algorithms for analyzing short time series gene expression data: astro that uses the order preserving matrix concept and mimesr that uses the minimum mean squared residue concept. both these algorithms use linear algebra techniques to identify coherent gene clusters over all time points in linear time. this offers a significant advantage over existing methods that employ greedy approaches or heuristics, since astro and mimesr avoid problems related to cost functions or the choice of predefined sets of expression profiles  <cit> . also, the complexity of our methods is smaller than that of existing algorithms, even when it is compared to those that use a greedy approach to speed up their running time  <cit> . astro identifies all gene clusters with coherent expression patterns, irrespectively of the magnitude of expression change. genes belonging in such clusters are generally expected to participate in the same biological processes . mimesr identifies all gene clusters with coherent expression change both in direction as well as in magnitude. genes belonging in such clusters are expected to be regulated by the same set of transcription factors . in general, mimesr identifies clusters that are enriched for genes belonging to the same pathways, while astro identifies clusters with genes that are regulated by the same transcription factors . in terms of overall statistical significance of the identified clusters, mimesr outperforms astro in most cases . in a direct comparison of the two algorithms in simulated data  we found that astro outperforms mimesr when fewer data points are available, whereas mimesr performs better when more data points are available.

testing astro &mimesr in well-characterized short time series gene expression datasets showed that it is robust to noise and to random patterns, and that it can correctly predict the temporal expression profile of relevant functional categories as confirmed by statistical analysis of go category membership over-representation and analysis of transcription factor occupancy in the promoters of the gene members of the various clusters. our approaches are shown to outperform existing clustering algorithms, including the popular k-means, as well as fcv and stem and they were able to distinguish between closely related but biologically distinct patterns. as expected, astro finds more homogeneous clusters than mimesr, with respect to the percentage of genes associated with a given transcription factor. this is because it takes into consideration the magnitude of the change in gene expression, which is more closely related to the transcription factors involved.

in principle, astro and mimesr can also be applied to long time series gene expression data  or gene expression data sampled over different conditions, but in this case the number of genes in each cluster is expected to be low. however, they can be adapted to identify local patterns, thus overcoming this problem.
