BACKGROUND
two component signal transduction systems  in plants were first described in  <dig> and rapidly ascribed to the signalling of a number of external outputs, including phosphate and nitrogen availability  <cit>  and stress  <cit> , usually through hormonal compounds  <cit> . more recently, related molecules have been linked to circadian regulation  <cit> . the full tcs structure in plants involves the perception of an external signal through membrane-bound histidine kinases , dimerization and trans-phosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent transfer of a phosphate group among alternate histidine and aspartic residues in the kinase receptor, intermediate phosphotransfer proteins  and response regulators , respectively. the conformational change induced by phosphorylation modifies the response regulator activity, either in its capacity to interact with other downstream proteins  or by modification of its function as a transcriptional regulator   <cit> . a wide array of physiological processes is regulated through phosphorelay routes, including senescence, meristem activity both in shoots and roots  <cit> , circadian mechanisms  <cit>  and tissue differentiation  <cit> . this multiplicity of tasks and the general ubiquity of most tcs molecules underscore the probable functional redundancy of elements within the system and the need for additional, external-to-the-route regulatory mechanisms.

transfer cells  occupy the base of the maize endosperm, directly in front of the maternal vascular terminals, and represent a modified surface, specialized in the uptake of nutrients from the apoplastic discontinuity between the mother plant and the seed  <cit> . this transport specialization, similarly to other transfer cells and transport-associated tissues elsewhere in the plant, involves the development of a highly invaginated basal surface, which presents flange wall ingrowths closely covered by cell membrane, abundant mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . additionally to nutrients, the basal endosperm transfer layer  cells receive environmental and developmental signals through the pedicel, which affect their own differentiation and function, and the proper growth and filling of the kernel. in particular, sugars and the hormones abscisic acid  and cytokinin have been shown to reach the mother-seed interface in high concentrations and affect the kernel development significantly  <cit> , suggesting that transfer cells possibly play a role in the interpretation and further transmission of those signals. in recent years a number of transfer cell specific genes have been described  <cit>  including a myb-related transcription factor, zmmrp- <dig>  which controls the expression of several of these genes  <cit>  through interaction with specific dna motifs in their promoters  <cit> . in a previous paper we reported the isolation of zmtcrr- <dig>  a type-a response regulator exclusively expressed in the transfer cell layer of the maize caryopsis during early development, and transcriptionally controlled by zmmrp- <dig>  remarkably, the zmtcrr- <dig> protein is exported from the transfer cells into the endosperm, where it can be detected at later developmental stages  <cit> . in this work we describe a second transfer cell-specific response regulator, related in sequence to zmtcrr- <dig>  and their interaction with known tcs molecules in maize. immunolocation and expression data within the seed for several proteins related to this transduction system support a role for the basal endosperm transfer cells in the perception of mother plant-borne signals and its transmission to the developing grain, with the hormone-insensitive, zmmrp-1-controlled response regulators zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig> conferring specificity to an otherwise ubiquitous two component signalling route. we also obtained circumstantial evidence indicating that similar pathways operate in arabidopsis in connection with transport-related tissues.

RESULTS
cloning of zmtcrr-2
zmtcrr- <dig> was identified in a blast search of a private cdna collection using the coding sequence of zmtcrr- <dig>  blast searches in the maize genome sequence http://www.maizesequence.org revealed that zmtcrr- <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  and similarly to zmtcrr- <dig> , contains  <dig> exons with short untranslated extensions, and a coding region of  <dig> bp. the exon sizes and the splicing positions are similar in both genes, except for exon  <dig> which encodes an additional amino acid in zmtcrr- <dig>  a synteny analysis to rice and sorghum genomes using the tools in the maize database sequence http://www.maizesequence.org links both loci to a single chromosome of rice  or sorghum . the corresponding syntenic regions are, however, in different chromosome arms, suggesting that they may have originated in an intra-chromosomal duplication event predating the separation of these species around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this event would have been followed by genome reorganisation in zea mays . a blast analysis of the cds with the ncbi non redundant database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov shows homologies to known type-a response regulators from plants and bacteria. the alignment of the protein sequences with response regulators from rice, arabidopsis and maize  clusters zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig> together with osrr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and osrr13h  . these proteins  share a reduced size even for type-a standards , and a common c-terminal motif , which is in fact the longest similar stretch, not present in other rr sequences. contrary to zmtcrr- <dig>  <cit> , zmtcrr- <dig> possesses all the canonical amino acids described to be critical for response regulator activity  <cit>  .

protein names are taken from ferreira and kieber  <dig>  ito and kurata  <dig>  and hirose et al. 2007; gi numbers are taken from the ncbi protein database. note that osrr13h corresponds to osrr <dig> in hirose et al.  <dig> 

expression of zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig> in developing endosperms
the expression of zmtcrr- <dig> has been previously shown to be restricted to the transfer cells at the base of the kernel, in a reduced time frame during early development and peaking at 8- <dig> dap   <cit> . rt-pcr analysis of zmtcrr- <dig> showed no expression in maize plant tissues other than the developing kernel . within the seeds, an early peak was detected around  <dig> dap and, contrary to the situation observed for zmtcrr- <dig>  a significant level of expression was observed until at least  <dig> dap . in situ hybridization experiments using the full length cdna as a probe indicated that the expression of the gene was restricted to the transfer cell layer; no signal was detected in the embryo, inner endosperm or pedicel . the signal remains confined to this area between  <dig> and  <dig> dap . the corresponding hybridizations with a zmtcrr- <dig> probe  are shown for comparison; these results show that the transfer cells express a pair of tissue-specific, developmentally controlled response regulators.

regulation of the expression of zmtcrr genes
the promoter of zmtcrr- <dig> has been previously shown to contain cis elements  responsive to a tc specific transcription factor, zmmrp- <dig>  <cit> . a bioinformatic analysis of a  <dig> base pair zmtcrr- <dig> promoter fragment showed several motifs similar to the tc-box, tatct at - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> bp  from the translation start site. the  <dig> bp upstream sequence was fused to the uida reporter gene and cotransformed in onion epithelial cells with a constitutive zmmrp- <dig> construct. after chromogenic detection, a positive transactivation result was obtained , indicating that zmmrp- <dig> is a direct transactivator of zmtcrr- <dig>  considering their identity as type-a response regulators, we tested the possible activation of both zmtcrr- <dig> and - <dig> transcription by culturing developing kernels on media containing different hormones and performing either northern blot or qrt-pcr as detailed in material and methods. none of the treatments tested  produced a significant variation in the levels of transcript . we used a detached leaf system similar to the one described in references  <cit>  and  <cit>  to further check the effect of cytokinins on the expression of zmtcrr- <dig> and - <dig> due to their structural similarity to tcs molecules. this system allowed the monitorization of the effect of the hormone treatment through the quantitation of well established inducible markers  <cit> , which have not been described in the maize kernel to our knowledge. none of the zmtcrrs was detected in the leaves, regardless of the treatment. in summary, our experiments did not provide any evidence for an involvement of cytokinin in the transcriptional activation of the zmtcrrs .

expression pattern of candidate tcs upstream components
two elements are positioned upstream of response regulators in the phosphorelay tcs pathways in plants, the sensory hybrid kinases and the intermediate histidine phosphotransfer proteins. in order to identify potential components of the tcs pathway in which zmtcrr-1/- <dig> participate, we have analysed the expression pattern of these elements along seed development.

three hps are currently known in maize  <cit> , located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a homology search did not show any additional loci in the maize genome. all three genes were found to be almost ubiquitously expressed . we found, however, differential expression patterns along seed development . zmhp <dig> and  <dig>  which are 88% identical in protein sequence, share also similar transcript kinetics, being already detectable at the earliest time point tested . transcript levels peak at  <dig> dap in the upper halves of the seeds and at  <dig> dap in the lower ones. the overall variation in the tested interval is within one order of magnitude. zmhp <dig>  on the other hand, displayed a distinct expression pattern, showing stable low level accumulation of transcript until  <dig> dap, when it raises, especially in the lower seed half, up to  <dig> times respective to the previous time point, and  <dig> to  <dig> times as compared to the other zmhps. this increase in expression did not extend to the embryo, which at  <dig> dap expresses the  <dig> zmhp genes at comparable levels .

 <dig> non ethylene receptors  histidine kinases have been described in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . we searched for additional loci to those described in  <cit>   and  <cit>   by homology searches against the maize sequence database http://www.maizesequence.org. the genome sequence analysis confirmed the presence of only these  <dig> separate hk loci in the current release of the maize genome sequence. qrt-pcr analyses of zmhk <dig>  1a <dig>  1b <dig>  1b <dig>   <dig>  3a and b  showed ubiquitous expression for all members , in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . along seed development, the level for the  <dig> histidine kinase transcripts was investigated using qrt-pcr ; zmhk <dig> and 1a <dig>  which are 93% identical in amino acid sequence, peaked at  <dig> dap in the upper part of the seed, with zmhk <dig> being the major isoform at this point. both transcripts decreased subsequently, but zmhk <dig> rises again in the whole kernel at  <dig> dap. zmhk1b <dig> and 1b <dig>  in spite of being also very similar in their primary structure , showed quite distinct expression kinetics. zmhk1b <dig> was the least expressed of the zmhk isoforms, except for a sharp, highly specific peak at  <dig> dap, rising over  <dig>  and almost  <dig> times  from the previous time point, thus reaching expression levels comparable to the other transcripts at that stage. remarkably, this expression pattern in the lower half of the seed almost replicates that previously reported for zmtcrr- <dig>  <cit> . zmhk1b <dig>  on the other hand, was expressed at a higher basal level, showing two minor increases  at  <dig> and  <dig> days after pollination. zmhk <dig> showed an early, 3-fold increase over the previous levels, peaking at  <dig> dap in the whole seed and then decreased back to its original levels. finally, the alternative splicing products of locus zmhk <dig>  maintained a stable expression level from  <dig> to  <dig> dap, when they both started to increase. in the embryo at  <dig> dap zmhk <dig> and 1a <dig> are the major hybrid kinase isoforms, zmhk1a <dig> seems to accumulate preferentially in the embryo, given the low expression levels detected in the whole seed samples at  <dig> dap .

protein kinetics along development
the downstream interactors of type-a response regulators are currently unknown in most cases. there is however ample evidence to support their direct upstream interaction with histidine phosphotransfer proteins within the transduction route  <cit> . to study whether zmtcrrs show coincidence with maize hps in timing and location, polyclonal antibodies were raised against zmtcrr- <dig>  zmhp <dig> and zmhp <dig>  the polyclonal anti-zmtcrr- <dig> was already available  <cit> . cross-reactivity tests using gst- and his-tagged proteins  proved that anti-zmtcrr- <dig> recognizes both zmtcrr peptides, whilst anti-zmtcrr- <dig> is specific to this second protein, allowing its differential analysis. the anti-zmhp <dig> serum recognizes zmhp <dig> with lower affinity, which was expected due to their high sequence similarity, and zmhp <dig>  although in this case this cross-reactivity was only observed using relatively high amounts of recombinant proteins. this serum is thus referred from here on as anti-zmhp1/ <dig>  the immunopurified anti-zmhp <dig>  however, does not react with the other phosphotransfer proteins, and allows the independent detection of this peptide.

the zmtcrr- <dig> peptide accumulation pattern reproduced almost identically that reported for zmtcrr- <dig>  being detectable since 6- <dig> dap with a maximal accumulation at  <dig> dap . in spite of the lack of transcription in the upper seed half, the peptide was detectable in this area since the early developmental stages. furthermore, the protein was only found in the upper seed halves at later developmental stages. the incomplete overlapping of protein and transcript accumulation patterns has been also reported in the case of zmtcrr- <dig>  <cit>  and very likely indicates that the proteins are exported towards the endosperm from the transfer cells where they are produced. the abrupt decay in protein concentration after  <dig> dap very likely reflects the combination of reduced transcript levels at the transfer cells  and dilution of the protein in the endosperm, where high amounts of storage proteins begin to accumulate after 11- <dig> dap. interestingly, the antisera detected two polypeptides within the expected size range . considering the functional nature of this peptide, this double band may represent a phosphorylated form of the protein.

concerning the detection of the phosphotransmitters, the anti-zmhp1/ <dig> antiserum detected a band of approximately  <dig> kda, consistent with the expected sizes of zmhp <dig> and  <dig> , which accumulated since  <dig> dap and appeared to be more abundant in the upper seed half, consistently with the accumulation pattern observed for the transcripts. the band decreased in intensity along development and was no longer detectable by  <dig> dap . zmhp <dig> was detected as a protein with an apparent size slightly smaller than the predicted  <dig>  kda, this may be explained by its high negative charge  at the neutral ph of the electrophoresis system, which causes a faster than expected migration. the protein was present since  <dig> dap all through the analysed interval, without significant differences between top and bottom halves within each time point . no steep increase in peptide levels was observed, in contrast to the variation detected in the transcript accumulation at  <dig> dap . this may be the result of the diluting effect of the reserve proteins being actively stored in the seed at that stage, although the existence of a post-translational regulation mechanism cannot be ruled out. significantly, the absence of reacting proteins in several time point samples assayed with the anti-zmhp1/ <dig> antiserum indicates that this antibody cannot detect zmhp <dig> at the concentrations found in planta. in summary, the three intermediate histidine phosphotransfer peptides are present in a time range which encompasses those of the zmtcrrs.

protein cellular localization
the polyclonal antisera were used to detect the proteins at the cellular level by chromogenic immunolocation . the parallel use of preimmune sera allowed us to identify unspecific background from "sticky" areas, such as the placento-chalaza. at  <dig> dap the anti-zmtcrr- <dig> antibody produced a clear signal in the transfer cell area, extending into the endosperm tissue above it . the signal is visible in inner areas of the endosperm where no transcription is detected, as previously reported for zmtcrr- <dig>  <cit> , indicating a similar transport of the peptide into the endosperm storage tissue . no specific signal is found at the pedicel . similar experiments performed with anti-zmhp1/ <dig> polyclonal serum labelled all endosperm compartments and the pedicel . by contrast, zmhp- <dig> was only weakly detectable at  <dig> dap within the endosperm ; the protein accumulated, however, in two distinct areas at both ends of the pedicel vascular terminals . at later stages  the clearest signal for this peptide is still concentrated in these areas . the corresponding preimmune panel shows no signal in this area.

protein-protein interaction experiments
we tested the  <dig> zmhps for interaction with both zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig> in a yeast-based 2-hybrid system. using a gal1-driven auxotrophy marker as a sensor for interaction, zmtcrr- <dig> interacted with all three zmhps, supporting a faster growth in the zmtcrr-1/zmhp <dig> interaction. zmtcrr- <dig>  on the other hand, showed positive results in the interaction test only with zmhp <dig>  as neither zmhp <dig> nor zmhp3-carrying clones supported yeast growth even after extended culture . a second, quantitative system based on fluorogenic galactosidase activity confirmed the zmhp <dig> stable interaction, and indicated, on the basis of the quantification of galactosidase activity, that the interaction of zmhp <dig> with zmtcrr- <dig> is more stable than with zmtcrr- <dig> .

function of the zmtcrr- <dig> promoter in arabidopsis
we had previously obtained evidence indicating that the promoter of zmmrp- <dig>  the transcriptional regulator of zmtcrr- <dig> and - <dig>  was labelling nutrient exchange surfaces in arabidopsis  <cit> . here we analyzed in a similar way the promoter of zmtcrr- <dig>  the expression pattern of the uida reporter gene was examined in  <dig> independent a. thaliana transgenic lines containing promoter:uida constructs. the signal was transiently visible in the endosperm of developing seeds within young siliques, concentrating in the area identified as the chalazal endosperm , a situation resembling that encountered in the maize basal endosperm. the gus signal disappeared as seed maturation proceeded, being absent in imbibed and germinating seeds. in the seedling, positive gus staining indicates promoter activation in isolated cells, associated to cotyledon and leaf venation , and in vascular branching points immediately below the shoot apical meristem . this signal was patent around  <dig> days after germination and became stronger around  <dig> days. roots and other aerial parts lacked any signal throughout the plant's life cycle. within the vascular bundles the signal localized to cells with a thickened primary wall, in close contact with xylem vessels. the staining was more intense in cells located in the internal side of the bundle, proximal to earliest developed vessel elements. . the effect of different hormonal treatments on the promoter activation was tested. neither naphthalene-acetic , indole-acetic acid , benzyl-aminopurine , gibberellic acid  nor aba caused visible alteration on the location or intensity of the gus signal when  <dig> day-old seedlings were cultured on them for  <dig> or  <dig> hours .

discussion
since their first description  <cit> , two component systems have been shown to take part in most of the transduction routes in bacteria and a number of sensing mechanisms in plants. some functions have been attributed to particular molecules through mutant analysis  <cit> , generally connected to cytokinin-mediated processes. in a previous paper we reported the isolation of a type-a response regulator specifically expressed in the basal endosperm transfer cell layer of the maize seed. this gene is transcribed under the control of a tissue-specific transcription factor in a restricted timeframe and the resulting peptide exported onto the starchy endosperm  <cit> . the protein  presents a number of unexpected features in a plant response regulator: it is short, with the regulatory domain encompassing the whole primary sequence and no c-terminal extension; its expression is not controlled by cytokinins, but developmentally regulated through a tissue specific transcription factor; it carries a d to h polymorphism affecting one of the amino acids in the active centre; and finally, and perhaps more strikingly, the protein accumulates in cells that do not transcribe the gene, suggesting a trans-cell operation of this signal transduction pathway.

in this work we have tried to identify other components of the tcs pathway in which zmtcrr- <dig> participates. in addition, we have identified a second gene  with very similar characteristics to zmtcrr- <dig>  both loci present a similar genomic structure and sequence identity of  <dig> % at protein level. however, a possibly significant difference from a functional point of view is the conservation in zmtcrr- <dig> of the canonical aspartic residue in position  <dig> . other than this, the similarity indicates a closer evolutionary ancestry between these sequences than to the rest of known maize response regulators  <cit> . in fact, a protein sequence comparison including type-a response regulators of arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa and zea mays  produces an independent branch where zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig> cluster with four putative response regulators predicted in the rice genome  <cit> . these putative orthologues are also short  and contain a c-terminal motif not found in other type-a rrs in these  <dig> species, except zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig>  furthermore, three of the four rice molecules  have been found to be expressed only in reproductive tissues.

the similarity between zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig> extends to their expression pattern. zmtcrr- <dig> transcript accumulates specifically at the betl, peaking around  <dig> dap. this similarity suggests a common regulatory mechanism. furthermore, both transcripts can be detected in transfer tissue ectopically induced in the aleurone layer by the expression of zmmrp- <dig>  <cit> . zmmrp- <dig> is a transfer cell specific myb-related, r1-type transcription factor, which has been shown to control a number of tissue specific genes . collectively, these data point to zmmrp- <dig> as a main transcriptional regulator of zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig>  and reinforce the role of this gene as a master regulator of transfer cell development. although the existence of a yet unidentified type-b response regulator expressed in the transfer cells is possible, all the currently known members of this class seem to be ubiquitously expressed. furthermore, the apparent lack of cytokinin-dependent transcriptional regulation in the in vitro cultures and detached leaf assays reinforces the hypothesis that these genes are not dependent on a standard type-b rr. our data suggest an alternative model in which these type-a rrs would have been recruited by the zmmrp- <dig> controlled pathway and subsequently adapted to participate in transfer cells' functions, which are not necessarily restricted to the processes occurring within the cells. this co-optation would be facilitated by the partial coincidence of the preferential recognition site of type-b rrs, agattc  <cit> , and the core binding site of zmmrp <dig> in betl genes, in complementary orientation, tatctc/gagata  <cit> . we have found similar sequences in the promoters of zmtcrr- <dig>  <cit>  and zmtcrr- <dig> , in the same relative positions than tc-boxes are located in betl genes  <cit> .

a further point of similarity between zmtcrr- <dig> and zmtcrr- <dig> is the polarized export of the corresponding proteins from the transfer cells into the endosperm, as shown by western blot analyses and immunolocation with antisera differentiating both proteins. a number of proteins produced in the tc, or in the adjacent embryo surrounding region, are exported to the pedicel, in some cases to participate in defensive functions  <cit> , which supports the active interfacial/exchange role of this tissue during seed development. an opposed polar signalling, from the transfer layer to the inner cell layers, is suggested by the differential appearance of these cells  as compared to the starchy endosperm cells. transmitting cells are elongated along the pedicel-silk axis and facilitate the symplastic transport of metabolites towards the crown, where they are used to build storage polymers. whether the primary role of zmtcrrs is exerted in the transmitting tissue remains unknown, although examples of non cell autonomous functions based on protein movement can be found in the literature  <cit> .

zmtcrr- <dig> could be detected in the transfer cells, while zmtcrr- <dig> is not  <cit> . this may reflect differential stabilisation mechanisms acting in the transfer cells, as those shown for phosphorilated vs. un-phosphorilated forms of arr <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , or a simple difference in the antibodies' sensitivity in immunolocation. in any case the lack of the phosphorilation target aspartic in zmtcrr- <dig> should be studied regarding this issue.

we have investigated the transcription of the other known components of tcs pathways , notably maize histidine kinases and histidine phosphotransfer proteins, along kernel development, trying to identify potential interactors of zmtcrr- <dig> and - <dig>  all these upstream components are almost ubiquitously expressed in the plant and have been shown to intervene in cytokinin signalling  <cit> . we found no significant quantitative variation  for zmhks or zmhps expression during early seed development, except for the receptor zmhk1b <dig>  which showed an expression pattern remarkably similar to that of the zmtcrrs. further investigation of this receptor, including its tissue location, chemical ligand and downstream interactors is of clear interest, as it may clarify whether both ends of the transduction route are connected.

the analyses of the expression, protein accumulation and distribution within the kernel  indicated that all three histidine phosphotransfer proteins co-localize with the zmtcrrs within the kernel, and are thus possible interaction partners. the two hybrid results  pointed to zmhp <dig> as the most probable interactor. however, local differences in protein concentration and availability of other interactors may determine the final partner in the kernel, or even variations along development. zmhp <dig> accumulated preferentially in two distinctive patches under the collapsing placento-chalaza in opposite ends of the endosperm, and associated to vessel terminals , suggesting involvement with other tcs components, a common feature in histidine phosphotransfer proteins  <cit> .

the relevance of cytokinins in the role of zmtcrrs is merely speculative at this stage. however, the current data about the function of histidine phosphotransfer proteins point to cytokinins, and a number of papers show their effect on seed development in processes such as cell division and tolerance to heat stress  <cit>  and maturation  <cit> , and a careful regulation of their homeostasis along kernel development  <cit> .

it must be noted that zmtcrr- <dig>  interacts more strongly than zmtcrr- <dig> with the phosphotransmitters . the relevance of this feature in planta remains to be determined, but differences in the transfer rate or the turnover of the phosphorylation state have been proposed as a mechanism to finely tune the activity of response regulators in transmitting a changing signal  <cit> .

we have previously shown  <cit>  that the promoter of zmmrp- <dig> responds to transport demanding situations  in heterologous species. in this work we show that the zmtcrr- <dig> promoter directs the expression of the uida gene to the arabidopsis developing seed and vascular tissues . the promoter activity within the seeds resembles that observed in maize for the zmtcrr genes and the behaviour observed for the zmmrp- <dig> promoter in arabidopsis. the activity of the zmtcrr- <dig> promoter in branching areas of the vascular system, particularly below the shoot apical meristem also resembles that reported for zmmrp- <dig>  <cit>  albeit the zmmrp- <dig> promoter labelled more exchange surfaces.

a detailed study of gus expressing cells shows staining of thick-walled cells associated to the xylem, interspersed and surrounding the earliest formed vessel elements within the bundle. the use of ruthenium red and toluidine blue stains, that allow detection of pectin and the differentiation of lignified and not lignified cell walls, respectively  <cit> , show that these cells are surrounded by an engrossed middle lamella and primary wall, , which identifies them as xylem parenchymatic cells. this cell type has been shown to participate actively in solute transport into and from the vessels, facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from xylem  <cit> , response to osmotic variations  <cit>  and participating in the modification of the cell wall in tracheary elements  <cit> . it's noteworthy that the zmtcrr- <dig> activity is not continuous along the veins but limited to specific cells along the bundle, and is not visibly affected by growth on hormone-supplemented media .

CONCLUSIONS
we have found two genes encoding type-a response regulators whose expression is cell type specific and developmentally regulated. we have shown that both molecules can be detected in the inner endosperm, and both are able to interact with known histidine phosphotransfer proteins. if zmtcrrs are indeed able to respond to signals arriving from the mother plant they would provide developmental regulation to the response to an external stimulus, by which only the coincidence of the proper signal from the mother plant and the right differentiation/maturation stage from the interfacial betl would transfer the message into the seed tissue. whether these regulatory characteristics apply to the putative related rice molecules osrr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 13h remains to be determined  <cit> , but if so, it points to a conserved adaptation of this type of signalling pathways to reproductive specific functions.
