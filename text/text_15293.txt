BACKGROUND
the sarcomere is the fundamental unit of the muscle myofibril, and mediates atp-dependent contraction and relaxation. while the components of sarcomeres are well understood, the mechanics and sequence of their assembly remain under debate. a key early process in myofibrillogenesis is the polymerization of α-actinin-rich z-bodies into the z-discs that flank the myosin-containing a-band. in a mature vertebrate sarcomere, z-discs are held in register with the central m-band by titin filaments tightly associated with filamentous actin  <cit> .

molecular chaperones, which mediate specific protein maturation events, have recently been shown to play important roles in vertebrate myofibrillogenesis. originally identified as an uncoordinated nematode mutation  <cit> , the muscle-specific chaperone unc45b cooperates with hsp <dig> to fold the n-terminal globular motor  domain of sarcomeric myosins  <cit> . depletion of these gene functions in zebrafish results in absence of integrated myosin in the sarcomere  <cit> , but no effects on z-disc formation were noted. while in vitro studies of these chaperones in cultured mammalian myoblasts have supported roles in sarcomere formation  <cit> , in vivo requirements for these proteins have not been described in vertebrates other than teleost fish.

vertebrate myofibrillogenesis is readily studied in xenopus embryos, where most skeletal muscle arises from blocks of mesodermally derived somites running along the flank that eventually contribute to the easily-imaged transparent tadpole tail. somites form and differentiate in a strict anterior-to-posterior sequence, permitting observation of different stages of muscle formation in a single embryo. recently, a number of xenopus tropicalis mutations displaying a range of developmental phenotypes  <cit>  including defective cardiac muscle formation  <cit>  have been described.

in one of these mutations, dicky ticker , embryos are completely paralyzed with no heartbeat. tail muscle shows decreased birefringence under polarized light, consistent with disruption of sarcomeric structures. while the myofibrillogenesis program initiates and muscle myosin is detectable at early stages, sarcomeric myosin heavy chain  staining rapidly decreases. disorganized sarcomeres bounded by α-actinin-rich structures eventually form, but the transition from z-bodies to z-discs is delayed. in the first use of the rapid gynogenesis-based positional cloning strategy developed by khokha et al,  <cit>  we show here that the dit phenotype is caused by a missense mutation in the myosin chaperone unc45b. these results not only demonstrate a conserved role for this protein in vertebrate myofibrillogenesis, but also suggest a novel function for this chaperone in z-disc formation, a key early step in sarcomerogenesis.

RESULTS
a cys to arg conversion in the ucs domain of unc45b disrupts sarcomerogenesis in dit
dit was first identified in a forward genetic screen for xenopus tropicalis developmental mutations  <cit> . homozygous embryos lack a heartbeat  and are completely paralysed even after vigorous stimulation , developing cardiac edema and dying by ~stage  <dig>  when visualised under polarized light, dit somites showed a marked reduction in birefringence compared to wild type, suggesting disruption to the normal paracrystalline sarcomere structure  consistent with defective muscle formation rather than aberrant innervation or metabolism. phalloidin staining of stage  <dig> tail muscle likewise showed severe disruption to myofibrils .

the rapid gynogenetic mapping strategy described in khokha et al.  <cit>  was used to place dit onto a chromosome and estimate a locus-centromere distance. briefly, dit and sibling wild type gynogenetic embryos were generated by 'early coldshock' suppression of polar body formation in haploid embryos derived from heterozygous carrier females. bulk segregant pools of mutant and wild type gynogenotes were then assayed with centromeric sslps from the  <dig> x. tropicalis chromosomes  <cit> . linkage was detected to marker 016h <dig> near the centromere of chromosome 2/linkage group  <dig>  but not to other centromeres . an estimate of the mutation-centromere distance was obtained from the fraction of phenotypically mutant embryos observed  in gynogenetic clutches, placing the locus ~ <dig> cm from the centromere using the formula assuming complete interference  = 50)  <cit> . sslps from this region of the meiotic map as well as additional bespoke sslps and snps from identified scaffolds were then used for high resolution mapping on embryos obtained from a conventional cross of polymorphic heterozygous carriers. analysis of  <dig> mutant embryos  placed the mutant locus in a  <dig> kb interval on scaffold_ <dig>   containing  <dig> gene models: ap2b <dig>  pex <dig>  aldh3a <dig>  and the sarcomeric myosin chaperone unc45b, whose loss-of-function phenotype in zebrafish closely resembles dit  <cit> . sequence of unc45b from wild type and dit embryos revealed a thymidine to cytidine transition at bp  <dig> in the coding sequence, converting cys <dig> to arg . conserved in both vertebrate and invertebrate unc45b orthologs , cys <dig> is in the n-terminal ucs  domain important for folding myosin in vitro  <cit> . whole mount in situ hybridization  of wild type embryos shows unc45b is expressed throughout the somites and heart at stage  <dig> , becoming further localised to the jaw, branchial arches and body wall muscles by stage  <dig> . the mutation in a conserved cysteine residue, expression during muscle development, and similarity of loss-of-function phenotypes in zebrafish combine to suggest unc45b may underlie the dit phenotype.

z-disc formation is delayed in dit
myofibrillogenesis in dit was investigated further by confocal microscopy. at stage  <dig>  the earliest at which dit can be identified, wild type and mutant embryos were scored, genotyped, and their sarcomeric structures analysed by immunohistochemistry. the oldest  somites of wild type sarcomeres showed myhc  integrating into evenly spaced a-bands . dit embryos at this early stage displayed myhc staining in disorderly fibrillar structures at levels comparable to wild type siblings , in contrast with the negligible myhc immunoreactivity observed in zebrafish unc45b and hsp90a mutants  <cit> . headless myosin species retain the capacity to form thick filaments  <cit> , and it is known that unc45b functions to prevent myosin aggregation  <cit> . the myhc staining seen in dit during early myofibrillogenesis may represent transient aggregates of filament intermediates in which head domains remain unfolded and are unable to integrate into the sarcomere.

we then evaluated z-disc formation in dit embryos; z-disc defects were not described in the zebrafish chaperone mutants steif and sloth  <cit> . in stage  <dig> x. tropicalis tadpoles, wild type anterior sarcomeres had formed discrete α-actinin-stained z-disc structures , while mutants lacked z-discs but showed punctate staining consistent with α-actinin-rich z-body precursors . occasional stretches of regularly spaced staining are seen consistent with the onset of sarcomere formation  similar to the premyofibrils described by sanger et al.  <cit> . in more posterior somites, sarcomere formation is at an earlier stage. figure 3e &2f show the border  between somites  <dig> and  <dig> in tails stained with α-actinin. in wild type , z-discs are beginning to assemble into sarcomeres in the slightly older somite  <dig>  while in the adjacent somite  <dig> no z-discs are seen. no organized α-actinin staining is seen in mutant embryos at these stages in somite 15- <dig> .

myhc is lost and z-disc formation recovers in dit tadpoles
later in development , wild type sarcomeres are organized into paracrystalline structures with myhc-stained a-bands, α-actinin-stained z-discs, and titin-positive i-bands in register . dit tadpole tails at this stage showed no organized myhc fibrils , and the level of immunoreactivity was significantly weaker than wild type, more closely resembling the zebrafish myosin chaperone mutations  <cit> . lower myhc protein levels in dit were confirmed by western blots of stage  <dig> and  <dig> embryos using another pan-sarcomeric myhc antibody, f <dig> . sarcomeric myhc proteins are subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation and autophagy  <cit> , and it is likely that the misfolded head domains in dit are actively degraded. interestingly, z-discs  were present in dit tadpole tails at these stages, although these were scattered and severely out of register .

depletion of unc45b phenocopies dit
to confirm that a deficit in unc45b function underpinned the dit phenotype, we injected two non-overlapping antisense morpholino oligonucleotides  into wild type embryos. both a translation blocking  and a splice blocking amo deleting ~2/ <dig> of the mature protein  resulted in highly significant numbers of paralysed or partially paralysed tadpoles lacking heartbeat ; splice-mo 32/ <dig> , compared to 0/ <dig> in control amo-injected embryos). confocal analysis revealed that both the atg-mo and splice-mo produced specific defects in sarcomere formation mirroring those in dit , with reductions in sarcomeric myhc staining and scattered α-actinin-rich z-disc-like structures. the similarity of the mutant phenotype to those produced by these two independent knockdown experiments is consistent with dit being a strong hypomorph of unc45b.

interestingly, wish analysis shows that dit embryos and unc45b antisense-mo injected embryos express increased levels of unc45b mrna relative to siblings or control mo-injected controls developed in parallel . in zebrafish steif  and sloth  mutants, expression of the mutated genes is also upregulated  <cit> . the chaperone hsp <dig> regulates its own expression by holding the transcription factor hsf <dig> in a latent complex, which is released during heat shock or pharmacological stress when unfolded proteins compete for hsp <dig> binding  <cit> . the freed hsf <dig> in turn directly upregulates hsp <dig> as well as other stress response chaperones  <cit> . in the dit and steif mutants, persisting unfolded myosin head domains could likewise bind hsp <dig> and free a heat shock factor to increase chaperone transcription.

discussion
while the organization of the mature sarcomere is well understood, the order and mechanism of its assembly remain under debate  <cit> . our data strongly suggest that z-disc formation, a key early step in myofibrillogenesis, initially requires the presence of mature sarcomeric myhc proteins. this observation most closely supports the premyofibril model proposed by du et al.  <cit>  in which closely spaced α-actinin-rich z-bodies are initially separated by non-muscle myosin ii; non-muscle myosin ii is then replaced by sarcomeric myhc proteins as these premyofibrils mature, coincident with z-body alignment and polymerization into z-discs . while closely spaced α-actinin-stained z-bodies are observed in dit sarcomeres, lack of mature sarcomeric myhc replacement could be responsible for delay of polymerization of these into z-discs, and z-disc alignment remains poor. our data provide less support for the model proposed by holtzer et al.  <cit> , which hypothesizes that titin 'stitches' together α-actinin rich i-z-i bodies with already formed thick filaments to add sarcomere elements at the ends of z-disc containing striated myofibrils. this model does not anticipate the presence of the regularly spaced premyofibril-like α-actinin-stained z-body structures observed in early dit sarcomeres. the molecular mechanism by which sarcomeric myhc might participate in z-disc maturation remains to be determined. while a direct interaction seems unlikely, feedback to z-bodies via correct myhc interdigitation with thin filaments or even contractile activity are also plausible explanations for the requirement for correct myhc head domain maturation. our data also do not rule out the possibility that unc45b functions directly in z-disc maturation on an unknown protein target; indeed, unc45b protein is known to localize to mature z-discs in zebrafish  <cit> . alternatively, incorrectly folded myhc heads or aggregates could interfere with z-disc formation in the mutant, with this block released following myosin degradation.

CONCLUSIONS
the x. tropicalis dicky ticker mutant demonstrates a conserved role for unc45b and sarcomeric myosin-specific chaperone function in tetrapod myofibrillogenesis, extending previous phenotypic analysis in teleost fish. a possible novel role for sarcomeric myhc integration in z-disc maturation is suggested by the observed delay in aggregation of α-actinin staining. dicky ticker is the second x. tropicalis mutation to be cloned, and the first to make use of the rapid gynogenesis-based mapping strategy. analysis of myofibrillogenesis mutations in x. tropicalis, with its potential for combining genetics with embryological and biochemical tools, promises additional insights into function and regulation of vertebrate muscle assembly.
