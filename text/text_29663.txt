BACKGROUND
metallothioneins  constitute a superfamily of small ubiquitous cytosolic proteins  which are able to bind metal cations through their numerous cysteine  residues . several functions have been proposed for these proteins  <cit> , such as protection from toxic metals and oxidative stress  <cit> , essential-metal homeostasis  <cit>  and protection against xenobiotics  <cit> . likewise, they have been implicated in protection against neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> , apoptosis and the biology of aging  <cit> , as well as in processes of development and cellular differentiation  <cit> . this is the reason why these proteins are considered to be multifunctional proteins, involved in many diverse cellular processes.

since  <dig>  when the first mt was described  <cit> , more than  <dig>  articles have been dedicated to the study of the structure, biochemical or functional features and gene expression analysis of mts  <cit> . mts have been reported in both eukaryotic organisms  and prokaryotic cells   <cit> . to date, the presence of mts has been reported among ciliated protozoa in only two genera  . however, with regard to the putative paramecium mt gene, no experimental data has been reported on its gene expression under metal stress  <cit> . experiments on expression are therefore needed in order for it to be considered as a real mt. attempts to classify mts have been made by different authors. in  <dig>  binz and kägi  <cit>  proposed a classification based on  <dig> families, defining one mt family for each main taxonomic group of organisms except fungi, to give six different sets. in this classification ciliate mts are included in family  <dig>  which has been subsequently divided into two main subfamilies: 7a or cadmium-binding mts  and 7b or copper-binding-mts   <cit> . at present, subfamily 7a includes  <dig> cdmts from different tetrahymena species: two from t. pyriformis   <cit> , three from t. thermophila   <cit> , one from t. tropicalis   <cit> , one from t. rostrata   <cit> , one from t. pigmentosa   <cit> , one from t. vorax , one from t. mobilis  and four from t. hegewischi   <cit> . subfamily 7b contains  <dig> cumts: two from t. thermophila   <cit> , one from t. pigmentosa   <cit> , two from t. tropicalis , one from t. rostrata   <cit>  and one from an unspecified tetrahymena sp <dig>  . the two subfamilies differ mainly in their typical cys residue clustering  <cit> .

tetrahymena mts have unique features with respect to mts from other organisms. their lengths  and molecular masses  are higher than mts from vertebrates ; therefore, they have a considerably higher number of cys residues and a potentially larger metal binding capacity per mt molecule  <cit> . as detected in other organisms, a remarkably regular and hierarchical modular structural organization has been observed in tetrahymena mts, mainly cdmts  <cit> . several authors have proposed evolutionary history models for these mt genes, based on their modular and submodular structure and gene duplication as the main mechanism involved in mt evolution  <cit> . in general, mt genes can be induced by an extensive range of different environmental biotic or abiotic stressors, such as metals, oxidative agents, heat or cold shocks, hormones, cytokines, ph changes, starvation, and a large variety of organic chemicals or drugs. likewise, tetrahymena mt gene expression can be induced by very diverse stressors  <cit> .

in this study we report the cloning and characterization of  <dig> new mt genes  isolated from five tetrahymena species never before analysed: t. borealis, t.elliotti, t.americanis, t. patula and t. malaccensis, selected from the two main taxonomic tetrahymena groups   <cit> . thereby increasing the cdmt sequences by about 46 % and the cumt sequences ~ 56 % in the tetrahymena mt family, to give us a broader view of these highly conserved molecules. furthermore, a new putative cumt from the tetrahymena related species and fish parasite ichthyophthirius multifiliis has been incorporated into the actual in silico analysis of the mt sequence list . owing to the high nucleotide sequence identities among these mt genes, it has only been possible to analyze six of them by quantitative rt-pcr under different metals and other environmental stressors.

RESULTS
new cd- and cumts from different tetrahymena species
at present, there are about  <dig> known species of the genus tetrahymena. these have been classified into two main groups: australis and borealis, according to the small subunit ribosomal gene   <cit> . at the same time, the borealis group is divided into three groups or ribosets: rsa <dig>  rsa <dig> and rsb. in order to isolate new mt genes, tetrahymena species from the ssrrna phylogenetic tree were selected  <cit>  to obtain a broader wide view of the biodiversity of these conserved genes. table  <dig>  shows all the tetrahymena mts reported up to now, including the new mts isolated in this study. so far,  <dig> tetrahymena species have been analyzed :  <dig> from the borealis group and  <dig> from the australis group. from these, a total of  <dig> cdmt and  <dig> cumt sequences have been reported . in the present study, we incorporated  <dig> new cdmt cdna sequences  and  <dig> new cumt cdna sequences , so thereby considerably increasing our knowledge of these conserved genes. also included in this analysis was a new cumt sequence from the ciliate parasite  ichthyophthirius multifiliis , giving a total of  <dig> cumt sequences considered in this study . of the new cdmt cdna sequences, one  is identical to the previously reported tmalmt <dig>  also isolated from the t.malaccensis  <cit> . however, in this putative cdna  5’or 3’utrs have not been reported, while our tmalamtt <dig> cdna already presents both utr regions .table  <dig> present ciliate metallothioneins

ciliate mts   <cit>  have been divided into two subfamilies: 7a  and 7b   <cit> . an updated phylogenetic tree drawn up to include the new inferred amino acid sequences from all the new ciliate mt genes , confirms the previous classification into two large groups or subfamilies: cdmts and cumts. this is due to the strict cys residue patterns or modular configuration of these proteins in both mt groups . although the cumt sequence from i. multifiliis  is clearly separated from the rest of the tetrahymena cumts, it is completely integrated in the cumt group or subfamily . in general, mts from the same tetrahymena species are located close together in the tree, although this is not always the case. this may indicate a certain convergent evolution of these genes into the tetrahymena genus, or a common ancestor gene structure which originated very similar proteins through the different tetrahymena species.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of all ciliate metallothioneins. two well defined groups corresponding to both mt subfamilies are observed. multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were obtained by using the t-coffee program. numbers indicate bootstrap values  from  <dig> replicates. brach lengths are drawn to scale as indicated by the scale bar. the names of the new mt sequences reported in this paper are indicated into the red boxes. see table  <dig> for ciliate species identification

cysteine patterns
cysteine  residues are the main amino acids in mt composition because they are the chelating points for metals, forming metal-thiolate clusters  <cit> . the total amount of tetrahymena mt cys residues is considerable  , due to the longer length of these molecules with respect to standard mts. however, the average cys percentage of these mts lies within the average cys percentage values for standard mts  . traditional cys  clusters appear in tetrahymena cdmts as in standard mts, such as: xccx , cxc  and xxcxx or non-clustered cys  . in addition, they have other cys clusters that are almost exclusive to tetrahymena cdmts: ccc , cxcc  or cxcxc   . these unusual cys clusters also appear in the mts of certain other organisms, such as the annelid eisenia foetida  , the yeast yarrowia lipolytica  , the arthropod callinectes sapidus  , the mollusk crassostrea virginica  , the american lobster homarus americanus , the amphibious xenopus laevis , the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  , the nematode caenorhabditis elegans   and the purple sea urchin strogylocentrotus purpuratus  . in tetrahymena cdmts, ccc and xccx are the most abundant clusters . however, in ciliate cumts ccc, cxcc and cxcxc clusters are almost absent . on the other hand, the predominant cluster in these cumts is cxc , as in mts from other organisms.table  <dig> distribution of cys clusters among tetrahymena mts

another structural feature differentiating both tetrahymena mt subfamilies is the relation between lys and cys residues along the polypeptide backbone. lys residues also seem to have an important role in these proteins because cys reactivity depends on the proximity of these basic amino acids. in ciliate cumts , as in mammalian mts, lys  residues are usually contiguous to cys residues. furthermore, the great majority of cxc motifs in cumts are ckc clusters . on the other hand, in tetrahymena cdmts  the ckc clusters are less frequent and normally limited to the c-terminal regions of the type  <dig> submodules . at physiological ph, lys residues are positively charged, and it has been reported  <cit>  that the presence of these adjacent basic residues considerably decreases the pk value thus decreasing the reactivity of cys residues. therefore, it is possible that tetrahymena cumts may have a certain metal buffering capacity that differs from the one theoretically assigned to them.

modular/submodular structure of the subfamily 7a 
the highly conserved cys residue locations in tetrahymena cdmt sequences define a strict modular/submodular structure in all of these proteins  <cit>  . each module was initially defined by the rule that every segment  carries a cxccx motif at its c-terminus, the last “x” being a lys  or glutamine  residue . module lengths vary from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and are separated by linkers of 2– <dig> amino acids . the number of modules per mt molecule is from  <dig> to  <dig>  so at present  <dig> cdmts have only two modules : tpyrmt- <dig>  tthemtt <dig>  trosmtt <dig>  tpigmt- <dig>  thegmt <dig>  tbormtt <dig>  tmalamtt <dig>  tpatmtt <dig> and tamermtt <dig>  the majority  have a tri-modular structure: tthemtt <dig>  tthemtt <dig>  ttromtt <dig>  tvormt <dig>  tmobmt <dig>  thegmt <dig>  tbormtt <dig>  tellimtt <dig>  tellimtt <dig>  tmalamtt <dig>  tmalamtt <dig>  tpatmtt <dig> and tamermtt2; only  <dig> of them  have four modules , and only one  has five modules  . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the 18s rrna phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> tetrahymena species analysed separates them into borealis and australis groups. although the species analyzed from the australis group are still scarce, we detect a certain tendency towards a cdmt tri-modular structure in the borealis group species with respect to the australis group . this could mean that the cdmt tri-modular structure might be more similar to the ancestral cdmt common structure for the tetrahymena genus.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree  of tetrahymena species with reported cdmts and their modular structures. two well defined ribo-groups corresponding to both taxonomical groups were obtained. multiple alignments of ribo-nucleotide sequences were obtained by using the t-coffee program. numbers indicate bootstrap values from  <dig> replicates. branch lengths are drawn to scale as indicated by the scale bar. the number of bi-, tri-, tetra- or penta- modular structures of cdmts are indicated for each tetrahymena group. see table  <dig> for ciliate species identification



these modules are made up of two types of submodules: type  <dig> submodules  have the consensus sequence c2-3x6c1-2x <dig> , while complete type  <dig> submodules  can be represented as c2x6–8 + cxcxxc1-2xxc1-2x1– <dig> . sm <dig> represents approximately the final half of the type  <dig> submodules , plus a quite conserved c-terminal region, where the last “x” is k  ~ 55 %, q  ~ 36 %, e  ~ 7 % or n  ~  <dig>  %. approximately 47 % of sm <dig> are incomplete; 42 % only present the c-terminal region, while ~ 5 % of them have only half the sm <dig>  . in most cases , these modules are made up of two complete sm <dig> and one complete sm <dig>  but a ~ 34 % of them present incomplete modules, such as tpyrmt- <dig> . despite the fact that tetrahymena cumts do not present such clear modular structure, their consensus sequence ckcx2-5cxc is repeated multiple times  may be substituted by another amino acid) . therefore, a structural organization based on these repeats should also be considered  <cit> .

gene duplication is one of the main phases in the generation and evolution of new genes and seems to be the main mechanism involved in the evolution of these proteins, as several authors have noted . given the clear modular structure of tetrahymena cdmts and the highly conserved cys repeats in both subfamilies, we might suppose that successive gene duplication events and subsequent specialization could be the main mechanisms involved in the evolution of these ciliate mts. therefore, the gene duplication hypothesis, already considered for tetrahymena mts  <cit> , is the most credible mechanism for explaining the evolution of these proteins. a model that attempts to explain the evolutionary history of tetrahymena mts has been described in  <cit> . it is based on the hypothesis that both mt subfamilies were constructed from an ancestral module, containing the c3x <dig> motif , which was duplicated many times as a result of episodes of gradual environmental pollution. therefore, both paralog duplications into the same species  and many orthologs could have been created in different related tetrahymena species, giving rise to those mt isoforms that are currently known to us.

an example of a probable semi-complete duplication of a cdmt gene originating a new cdmt isoform in the same species, can be observed in cdmt genes from t. malaccensis . two copies of the tmalamtt <dig> gene isoform  seem to have been involved in the creation of the tmalamtt <dig> gene . a recombination process seems to have occurred between a 29 bp region from the 3’ end of one tmalamtt <dig> gene copy and a 40 bp region from the 5’end of a second copy of this same gene, together with the elimination of 60 bp from both gene copies, resulting in the origination of the junction area  between both tmalamtt <dig> gene copies . this 9 bp new sequence is formed by four nucleotides from one tmalamtt <dig> copy  and  <dig> inverted nucleotides from the other gene copy . therefore, the tmalamtt <dig> gene is composed of a first uncompleted copy  of the tmalamtt <dig> gene, a junction region  originated after recombination and elimination, and a second uncompleted copy  of the tmalamtt <dig> gene . through evolution, these uncompleted tmalamtt <dig> copies have suffered some degree of gene diversification, so each of them currently presents  <dig> and 94 % identity, respectively, with respect to the corresponding section of the original tmalamtt <dig> gene sequence .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of tmalamtt <dig> gene origin from tmalamtt <dig> gene duplication. 5’ and 3’ striped sections show the eliminated regions  of both tmalamtt <dig> gene copies. the red boxes in the striped sections from each tmalamtt <dig> gene copy and in the tmalamtt <dig> gene represent nucleotides forming the junction between both copies. numbers indicate the nucleotide location. see the text for explanation



asymmetry of the codon usage for glutamine residues: phylogenetic implications
glutamines  are important residues for mts because they are also involved in stabilizing the metal-protein complex  <cit> . ciliates use a particular genetic code, because the uaa and uag codons, which are universal stop codons in many organisms, codify the amino acid glutamine , uga being the only stop codon used by these eukaryotic microorganisms   <cit> . almost all ciliate mts  contain q residues  . in general, tetrahymena cdmts have more q residues than cumts . in a previous study  <cit>  it was hypothesized that gln residues were only codified by caa codons in tetrahymena cumts. however, after analyzing  <dig> new ciliate cumts, we have detected that this is not necessarily the case. although the universal caa codon is predominant in cumts , it is not the only one encoding gln  . on the other hand, tetrahymena cdmts mainly use the uaa codon to codify this amino acid , together with other codons  . moreover, in cdmts these uaa codons are primarily located in liker regions  and at the end of sm <dig> . the total ratio of non-canonical /canonical  gln codons for tetrahymena cdmts is 123/55 =  <dig>  . the opposite is true for cumts, however, where this ratio is 39/67 =  <dig>  or the inverse 67/39 =  <dig>  . interestingly, only two cdmts sequences  use the four possible gln codons . this drastic asymmetry in codon usage for gln residues again corroborates the fact that tetrahymena cumts are more similar to standard mts. likewise, it shows another important difference between both mt subfamilies.table  <dig> distribution of glutamine codons in both ciliate mt subfamilies

from a phylogenetic point of view, which we reported in a previous review article  <cit> , it seems cumts are diverged earlier than cdmts as it has been reported that rather than resulting from a single ancient event, these genetic code deviations arose independently several times within the phylum ciliophora  <cit> . also, if these changes occurred in the trna gene of an ancestral ciliate using the standard genetic code, we would have to assume that tetrahymena cumts appeared before cdmts . this agrees with the assumption, supported by several authors, that two early mt lineages  were already present in the early phases of eukaryotic evolution  <cit> . it appears that early on in evolution, the primary function of mts was to bind to physiologically important or essential metals . accordingly, the appearance and evolution of mts was probably not dictated by cd, although with the evolution of higher life forms, mts became more indispensable for protecting against cd and other non-essential metals than for performing other suggested functions  <cit> .

other interesting features of tetrahymena mts
tetrahymena mts are considerably longer  than standard ones . of the ciliate cdmts and cumts, the longest are thegmt <dig>  and immtt <dig>  or tbormtt <dig> and tbormtt <dig> , respectively . the length they reach is therefore more than double that of the longest standard mts. despite having the longest mts and a higher number of cys residues, the cys % lies within the range for standard mts  . however, because of their greater amount of cys residues, they present a higher theoretical metal binding capacity than standard mts. the calculation of this theoretical metal binding capacity takes into consideration that all cys residues in vertebrate mts are involved in heavy metal binding; therefore, the stoichiometry is cd <dig> for cdmts and cu <dig> for cumts  <cit> . the 3d structure analysis of several mts corroborates this stoichiometry  <cit> . we can assume that this stoichiometry is also applicable to tetrahymena mts and have calculated the theoretical binding capacity for all of them . the shortest tetrahymena cdmts   are able to bind  <dig> or  <dig> cd2+/molecule and up to  <dig> cd2+/molecule  in the case of tpyrmt- <dig>  which is one of the longest cdmt  with the highest amount of cys residues  . the average amount of the theoretical cd binding capacity of these cdmts is about  <dig> cd2+/molecule , which is more than double that of standard mts . some of these data have been corroborated experimentally; for instance:  <dig> cd2+ per mole of protein or  <dig> cd2+ per polypeptide for tpyrmt- <dig>  <cit> . likewise, a stable in vitro cd <dig> complex has been suggested  <cit>  for tthemtt <dig>  , and cd <dig> complex has also been suggested  <cit>  for the cumt tthemtt <dig>  with a metal-to-cys residue ratio of about 1: <dig> for both t. thermophila mts. in addition, it was found that cu2+ cannot replace cd2+ from the cd16-tthemtt <dig> complex, but cu2+ can replace cd2+ from the cd11-tthemtt <dig> complex  <cit> . this confirms the classification of the tthemtt <dig> and tthemtt <dig> as cdmt and cumt, respectively. more recently, we have analysed the metal binding preference and abilities of the five mt isoforms from t. thermophila by electrospray mass spectrometry, circular dichroism and uv–vis spectrophotometry  <cit> . we conclude that both cdmt isoforms  which yield unique cd17- and cd8- complexes, respectively, are optimal for cd2+ coordination, thus corroborating the theoretical metal binding capacity values obtained for these cdmts . the mtt <dig> isoform showed poor binding abilities with both cd2+ and cu+, and yielded the best result whith zn2+. although this mt, also considered as a cdmt, has a theoretical metal binding capacity value of about  <dig>  the two histidine  residues present in the protein enhance the relative affinity for zn2+ through their imidazol rings  <cit>  in comparison with cd2+. his residues, the most frequent zn ligands in metaloenzymes, are also present in mts  from a variety of species , thus increasing the affinity for this essential metal. of the tetrahymena mts, only two cdmts   contain his residues, while cumts contain nine isoforms with one or two his , coinciding with the general knowledge that this amino acid is more abundant in cumts than in cdmts. in addition, his residues have an important role in mt proteins as they stabilize the formation of metal-protein complexes  <cit> . both t. thermophila cumts , were found to form homometallic cu-complexes   <cit> , which coincides with the theoretical metal binding capacity value obtained  . zn-mt complexes were only found in tthemtt <dig>   <cit> . these cumts  differ in only one relevant amino acid position , and it is interesting how this amino acid position change increases the cumt character  of tthemtt <dig>  in relation to tthemtt <dig>   <cit> . this special feature has also been reported in snail mts, balancing in favour of zn/cdmts  or cumts   <cit> .

another peculiar characteristic of mts  is the large asymmetry in the ratio of specific amino acids, such as the positively charged amino acids lys and arg. there is a considerably higher use of lys residues with respect to arg residues, and this asymmetry  appears in all reported mts. in ciliate mts the arg residues are almost absent of the cdmts, only two  present one arg residue , and only two cumts  have arg residues, with one and two residues, respectively . the location of these arg residues is the same as those of lys residues in other ciliate mt sequences. these two positively charged amino acids  are mostly exposed to the protein surface and play important roles in protein stability by forming electrostatic interactions. arginine forms a higher number of electrostatic interactions compared to lysine. experiments carried out on the green fluorescent protein , after changing lysine for arginine on the protein surface and retaining protein activity, have shown that the gfp variant was relatively more stable compared to the control gfp , but the thermal stability of the protein was similar to the control  <cit> . on the other hand, proteins with elevated solubility, a higher expression and abundant intracellular levels have an increased ratio of lys content to arg content  <cit> . in general, mts have large number of lys residues and null or very few arg residues per molecule, preferring higher solubility and the avoidance of protein aggregates to higher stability by forming a larger number of electrostatic interactions . this could therefore mean that the asymmetry  reported in all mts is a basic requirement for forming proteins with an elevated solubility and high intracellular level to respond to metal stress.

analysis of tetrahymena mt cdnas
after comparing all new isolated cdnas of putative mt genes with the genomic dna from the corresponding tetrahymena species, we confirmed that none of these genes have introns in their open reading frames, which is also the case in all previously reported tetrahymena mt genes  <cit> . the absence of introns could be related to a faster gene response to different environmental stressors. the presence of introns can delay regulatory responses and they are selected against in genes with transcripts requiring rapid adjustment in order to survive environmental changes  <cit> . in general, the gene expression of tetrahymena mt genes is very fast, as reported in a cdmt gene  from t. pigmentosa, in which an approximately tenfold increase of this transcript was detected after 30 min cd treatment  <cit> . an exception was reported in the gene isoform mtt <dig> of t. thermophila, in which an intron was located in the 3’utr of the corresponding cdna. the existence of mtt <dig> mrnas with and without this intron supports the first case of alternative intron splicing reported in this ciliate  <cit> . in the tetrahymena comparative database  the mtt <dig> dna sequence from t. malaccensis  shows a putative intron . after a more detailed analysis, we detected that the putative intron corresponds to the amino acid sequence of the second type  <dig> submodule from the second module, sequence that is quite conserved in almost all tetrahymena cdmts. the nucleotide sequence identified as an intron  starts in gt and ends in ag , and therefore, it might be assumed that it would coincide with the ciliate consensus intron ends . a similar situation in which no introns are observed is detected in tamermtt <dig>  and tpatmtt <dig>  cdnas. the gt pair corresponds to a cys residue , while ag pair corresponds to glu  residue . the same occurs in the tamermtt <dig> and tpatmtt <dig> cdmt sequences, but not in the rest of the tetrahymena cdmts, because the majority codon used for glu residues is gaa. in addition, the a + t content of these regions has very similar values to the complete orf sequences from all cdmts reported to date . all of this corroborates that the putative intron reported in a cdmt from t. malaccensis  is not a real intron but rather an error.

in general, mt genes are mainly regulated at transcriptional level  <cit> . as in a previous study using an in silico analysis  <cit> , we identified several conserved motifs in both 5’ and 3’utr regions from the new isolated cdna molecules, which may be related to the regulation of their gene expression and/or transcript processing. in the 5’utr region or putative promoter we identified two types of motifs : a tata box  with an average number of ≈  <dig> motifs/cdna in both cd- and cumts, and motifs similar to mtcm <dig>  <cit>  with an average number of ≈  <dig> motifs/cdna in cdmts or ≈  <dig> in cumts. this mtcm <dig> motif was identified in almost all tetrahymena mt promoters , so these sequences might play an important role in the gene expression regulation of these mts. most mtcm <dig> motifs include the consensus sequence tgatca or similar , which recalls to the sequence tca) binding the eukaryotic ap- <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . in saccharomyces cerevisiae an ap- <dig> transcription factor  is involved in response to oxidative stress and metal resistance  <cit> . transcription factors similar to ap- <dig> have been detected in the mt promoters of insects  and mollusks   <cit> . ap- <dig>  also known as c-jun, is a member of the bzip superfamily of eukaryotic dna-binding transcription factors. in t. thermophila the number of mtcm <dig> motifs in the three cdmt putative promoters is correlated with the gene expression level of each gene therefore, the relative induction ranking of gene expression is: tthemtt5> > tthemtt1 > tthemtt <dig>  <cit> . this motif is present  <dig> times in tthemtt <dig>  twice in tthemtt <dig> and  <dig> times in tthemtt <dig> promoter region . the promoter of the tthemtt <dig> gene has a 416 bp tandem duplication . five copies of the mtcm <dig> motif are present in each duplication and another three copies are near to the start codon  <cit> . quantitative gene expression analysis revealed that tthemtt <dig> is the gene most strongly induced by diverse environmental stressors   <cit> . the presence of the duplicated promoter region in tthemtt <dig> may be related to the high expression level of this cdmt gene when compared with the rest of t. thermophila cdmt genes. there is no direct and clear correlation between the number of mtcm <dig> motifs in the putative promoter regions of each tetrahymena mt gene studied and their higher or lower expression level.table  <dig> conserved motifs detected in 3’ and 5’ utr regions of tetrahymena cdmt genes

of the  <dig> new tetrahymena mt genes only  <dig> were analyzed, using qrt-pcr, owing to the great similarity among mt gene nucleotide sequences isolated from the same tetrahymena species, which makes it impossible to design specific primers to differentiate each gene. we studied the expression of two cdmt genes  and one cumt gene  from t. borealis. the rest of the mt genes isolated from this species have a great similarity; the tbormtt3/tbormtt <dig> and tbormtt4/tbormtt <dig> pairs have  <dig> and 98 % identity, respectively. one cumt gene  from t. elliotti was analyzed because the tellimtt1/tellimtt <dig> pair has 85 % identity, and although tellimtt <dig> is very similar to tellimtt <dig> the later is much longer, making it possible to design specific primers to amplify a fragment of the tellimtt <dig> 3’ region. only one cumt gene was analyzed from t. americanis because tamermtt <dig> and tamermtt <dig> are almost identical . finally, one other cumt gene expression  was carried out from t. malaccensis because the tmalamtt1/tmalamtt <dig> and tmalamtt3/tmalamtt <dig> pairs have  <dig> and 94 % identity, respectively. chang et al. , used qrt-pcr to analyze the expression of a gene  isolated from t. malaccensis under metal stress   <cit> , but this gene  has 84 % identity with a second cdmt gene, tmalamtt <dig>  which we isolated from the same tetrahymena species, this being the reason we were not able to analyze them by qrt-pcr. therefore, the gene expression analysis carried out by chang et al.   <cit>  very probably corresponds to the sum of both cdmt gene expressions . in the case of t. patula it was not possible to analyze the expression of any of the genes because both cdmt genes  have 91 % identity.

figure  <dig> shows the relative fold induction values for each mt gene expression under five different metal stress treatments at 1 h  or 24 h . in general, the induction values are higher at 1 h of treatment than after 24 h of metal exposures, except for the cdmt gene tbormtt <dig> under cd2+, cu2+ or pb2+ treatments . both putative cdmt genes from t. borealis  are induced by cd2+ among other inorganic cations, but there are several differences in the expression patterns of each gene isoform. at both  <dig> and 24 h exposures of cd2+, pb2+ or as5+, the expression levels for tbormtt <dig> are considerably higher than for the tbormtt <dig> gene. on the other hand, the tbormtt <dig> gene isoform seems to be induced later and more uniformly with these metals. therefore, under the same stress conditions, two differential gene expression behaviors are detected for these t. borealis cdmt isoforms; the tbormtt <dig> gene responds faster and with a higher level to most metal stress, while the tbormtt <dig> gene responds later and with a lower level under the same stress conditions . both genes respond to arsenate . after 1 h of treatment with this toxic metalloid, tbormtt <dig> is induced about 300-fold while tbormtt <dig> is only induced ≈ 20-fold. the toxicity of arsenic depends on its chemical form and state of oxidation, and is generally assigned to its capacity to produce ros . arsenic-induced ros originate lipid peroxidation and genotoxic damage  <cit> . metallothioneins reduce arsenic toxicity, either because as5+ may interact with their thiol groups and to involve detoxification, or they may act as antioxidants to protect against the oxidative stress originated by as5+  <cit> . in fact, arsenic induces mt gene expression  <cit> , including some previously studied tetrahymena mt genes   <cit> .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of six tetrahymena mt genes after diverse metal treatments. relative expression levels for each mt gene are shown in the different histograms, after cellular treatment with heavy metals, during exposures of 1 h  or 24 h . each bar of the histogram corresponds to an average value ± sd of two or three independent experiments. asterisks indicate significant differences from control at p <  <dig> . numbers on each bar indicate the corresponding average fold induction value for each treatment. see table  <dig> for mt gene identification

the rest of tetrahymena mt genes analyzed are putative cumts, which are induced primarity but not exclusively by cu2+ , as is also the case in other previously studied cumt genes from other tetrahymena species  <cit>  . the tbormtt <dig> gene is enormously induced by zn2+ and cu2+, especially after 1 h of treatment. this is considerably more than other cumt genes , so this mt may play an important role in essential metal  homeostasis, which might also occur in cdmts, such as; tthemtt <dig>  <cit> , thegmt <dig>  thegmt <dig>  <cit>  and other cumts . almost all of these have his residues in their molecules , which, as previously indicated, enhance the relative affinity for zn2+  <cit>  or cu2+.

comparisons of the qrt-pcr values obtained by different authors is difficult because of the different experimental conditions used, but even when conditions are the same and identical samples are used, it is difficult to reproduce experiments from different laboratories  <cit> . however, after the qrt-pcr values from different tetrahymena mt genes are compared , some general considerations can be inferred: a) in general, tetrahymena cdmt genes are mainly induced by cd2+ , whereas cumt genes are induced by cu2+ . this difference corroborates their separation in two previously well-defined sub-families   <cit> . b) induction by zn2+ sometimes occupies first position in the ranking of relative fold-induction values for both cd- or cumt genes but only with 1 h metal treatments, indicating a possible metal homeostatic role. c) occasionally, induction by pb2+ replaces cd2+ at the top of the ranking, as in the case of tthemtt <dig>  trosmtt <dig>  thegmt <dig> and thegmt <dig>  this is likely to be due to similarities between pb2+ and cd2+ in their chemical structure. mts are induced by pb2+ in rats, humans and fishes . pb2+ is second to cd2+ in its ability to displace zn2+ from hepatic znmt and is able to displace cd2+ from the cdmt complex  <cit> . a transcriptome study in plants has revealed that many genes respond similarly to pb2+ and cd2+  <cit> . other metals can also induce tetrahymena mt gene expression, for instance: la3+ induces the expression of both tthemtt <dig> and tthemtt <dig> genes. fluorescence analysis shows that la3+ binds to both t. thermophila mts  <cit> , and that the tpigmt- <dig> gene is induced by hg2+  <cit> .

mt gene expression, including both tetrahymena cd- and cumt genes, is induced by oxidative stress originated by h2o <dig> or organic compounds, such as paraquat  or menadione  . however, the fold-induction values obtained after pq treatment are generally very low or null . on the other hand, fold-induction values for md  are generally significantly higher than those obtained with pq treatment . both compounds are pro-oxidants generating superoxide anions through redox cycling  <cit> , and they are known to potentially activate the transcription of some mts  <cit> , such as cup <dig> from s. cerevisiae  <cit> . certain antioxidant ability for both t. thermophila mts  has been suggested, because of the appearance of disulfide bonds in cdmt complexes after in vitro reaction with no  <cit> . however, as shown by both previous results and our own , other tetrahymena cdmt genes  are not significantly induced by h2o <dig> or pq  <cit> . likewise, the apoptosis inductor camptothecin  does not seem to be a good inducer of tetrahymena mt gene expression, except in the case of the tbormtt <dig> gene, which is slightly induced  after 24 h treatment .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of six tetrahymena mt genes after apoptotic or oxidative stress treatments. relative expression levels for each mt gene are shown in the different histograms, after cellular treatment with different oxidative or apoptotic stressors, during exposures of 1 h  or 24 h . each bar of the histogram corresponds to an average value ± sd of two or three independent experiments. asterisks indicate significant differences from control at p <  <dig> . numbers on each bar indicate the corresponding average fold induction value for each treatment. a gene expression induction is considered positive when the fold-induction value obtained is >  <dig> . see table  <dig> for mt gene identification



other abiotic environmental stressors  have been analyzed as inducers of tetrahymena mt gene expression. as shown in fig.  <dig>  acid ph induces gene expression in some tetrahymena mt species , mainly in cumts. under basic ph stress, only four new tetrahymena genes are induced  with fold-induction values between ≈  <dig>  and  <dig> . in general, ph changes induce a very wide and variable range of responses in tetrahymena mt genes, from null  <cit>  to a certain degree of induction irrespective of whether they are cd- or cumts.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of six tetrahymena mt genes after different abiotic stress treatments. relative expression levels for each mt gene are shown in the different histograms, after cellular treatment with different abiotic stressors  during exposures of 3 h , 24 h , 48 h  or 4 days . each bar of the histogram corresponds to an average value ± sd of two or three independent experiments. asterisks indicate significant differences from control at p <  <dig> . numbers on each bar indicate the corresponding average fold induction value for each treatment. a gene expression induction is considered positive when the fold-induction value obtained is >  <dig> . see table  <dig> for mt gene identification



high temperature  induces gene expression in the majority of tetrahymena mt isoforms . t. rostrata mts seem to be quite sensitive to thermal stress, because both isoforms  are considerably induced by the 2 h heat-shock  treatment  <cit> . likewise, the three isoform genes analyzed from t. borealis are also induced by 42 °c  . according to several phylogenetic studies, both tetrahymena species are very closely related  <cit>   and both species belong to the rsa <dig> riboset of the borealis group, although t. rostrata is a histophagous ciliate, whereas and t. borealis not  <cit> .

however, other mt genes from the tetrahymena species are not induced by high temperature  <cit>  , although it has been reported that the tthemtt <dig> gene is also induced  at 40 °c   <cit> . in general, a low temperature  does not induce the gene expression of tetrahymena mt genes.

one of the main and more common environmental stressor to which cells are subject is starvation. among newly analyzed tetrahymena mt genes, the tbormtt <dig> gene has a higher fold-induction value, while the rest of the genes present very low or null induction values under starvation stress . previous studied of tetrahymena mt genes have also shown induction  under starvation conditions  <cit> . the tthemtt <dig> gene is expressed during ciliate conjugation   <cit> , and the s. cerevisiae cup <dig> metallothionein gene is induced under glucose starvation  <cit> .

at present, this multi-stress character has been reported by the majority of expression analyses of mt genes under diverse abiotic stressors  <cit> . the transcriptional induction of several mt genes by a variety of stress conditions suggests that cellular exposure to one type of stressor might lead to the acquisition of tolerance towards another different stressor. this cross-protection reported in some organisms suggests at least the partial existence of overlapping between genome responses to different types of stress  <cit> . this overlapping genome expression comprises general stress-responsive genes, such as heat-shock or mt genes.

independent of this general multi-stress feature of mts, a differential gene expression level exists under the same environmental stressor, in different mt gene isoforms from the same subfamily, the same tetrahymena species or among different species, which also seems to exist in different mammalian mt isoforms  <cit> . there are several examples in the same tetrahymena species : a) the three cdmt isoform genes from t. thermophila present differential expression patterns. both tthemtt <dig> and tthemtt <dig> seem to be general stress and metal detoxification proteins. however, the gene expression induction values reached by tthemtt <dig> gene are considerably higher than the rest of the t. thermophila mt isoforms  <cit> , and it responds preferably but not exclusively to pb2+. on the other hand, the tthemtt <dig> gene preferably responds, at a lower level, to cd2+  <cit> . in fact, according to a physicochemical analysis of these mts recombinantly synthesized as metal-complexes  <cit> , tthemtt <dig> has a higher affinity or binding preference by cd2+ than tthemtt <dig> isoform. the transformed t. thermophila strain  with the pmtt1::gfp::mtt <dig> plasmid construct  has been shown to be about  <dig> times more resistant to cd2+ with regard to the wild-type strain  <cit> , indicating that the tthemtt <dig> promoter responds to cd2+ and that an increase in the tthemtt <dig> gene dose  affects the cd2+ lc <dig> value of this ciliate. a third his-containing cdmt isoform  has a higher affinity to zn2+  <cit> , and could be involved in the intracellular homeostasis of this metal; b) two cdmt isoform genes from t. hegewischi   <cit>  show different gene expression induction patterns, although, as in other cases, these fold-induction values change depending on the metal time exposure ; c) likewise, the two new cdmt gene isoforms from t. borealis  also have different gene expression induction patterns .

in the majority of organisms, several isoforms of mt genes are present, suggesting the existence of differential cellular roles for them. the differential gene expression patterns reported from different mt isoforms under the same environmental stressor corroborate this idea. however, more extensive analysis needs to be done on the molecular behavior of each mt isoform and its relevance with respect to cellular response to a specific stress. future analyses of knockout strains in one mt gene isoform and expression studies carried out on the rest will be of great importance for understanding the role of each mt isoform.

CONCLUSIONS
at present, a total of  <dig> mt gene isoforms from different tetrahymena species have been reported, of which  <dig> have been isolated as new cdnas and reported in this study. in addition, one more mt gene from the sequenced macronuclear genome of the tetrahymena-related ciliate ichthyophthirius multifiliis has been added to the ciliate mt analysis described in this paper. from analysis of the results, the following points can be conclude:two main tetrahymena mt subfamilies  were once more corroborated after the  <dig> new mt cdnas isolated from different tetrahymena species were analyzed. both mt subfamilies are based on their protein structural organization  and their preferential gene induction under cd2+ or cu2+ stress.

among all the known mts from most organisms, the tetrahymena mts have several unique features. for example, they are considerably longer in size , and therefore have higher molecular masses than standard mts. cdmts have relatively abundant ccc motifs with a strictly conserved modular-submodular structure and higher metal binding capacities.

among the tetrahymena cdmts, the tri-modular structure seems to occur mainly in the borealis group, while the bi-modular structure is found in the majority of species from the australis group.

the remarkable asymmetry between tetrahymena cd- and cumts in codon usage for glutamine residues, corroborates the possibility that cumts could have diverged earlier than cdmts in the tetrahymena genus.

the gene expression patterns from the new tetrahymena mt isoforms analyzed corroborate their multi-stress character. likewise, a differential gene expression behavior among different mt isoforms is present in the same tetrahymena species.
