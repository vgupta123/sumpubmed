BACKGROUND
zinc and iron are essential for plant metabolism and development  <cit> . zinc serves as a key structural motif in many proteins, including dna-binding zn-finger protein  <cit> , ring finger proteins and lim domain containing proteins  <cit> , which play vital roles in controlling cellular processes such as growth, development and differentiation. an adequate zn content enhances crop productivity  <cit> . iron plays an important role in electron transfer in photosynthesis and respiration, though high concentration of intracellular iron may lead to elevated fe3+/fe2+ redox reactions and cause damage  <cit> . the deficiency of zn and fe decreases plant growth and affecting cereal production and grain quality  <cit> , but excess zn and fe may cause significant toxicity to biological systems  <cit> . therefore, plants have established a tightly controlled system to balance the uptake, utilization and storage of these metal ions  <cit> . because zn cannot diffuse across cell membrane, specific zinc transporters are required to transport zn into cytoplasm  <cit> . in recent years, a number of metal transporters have been identified in plants, including the p1b-atpase family, zinc-regulated transporter , iron-regulated transporter -like protein , natural resistance-associated macrophage protein  family, and cation diffusion facilitator  family  <cit> .

zrt, irt-like protein  family has been characterized ubiquitously in organisms, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals, and has been demonstrated to be involved in metal uptake and transport  <cit> . zip proteins generally contribute to metal ion homeostasis by transporting cations into the cytoplasm  <cit> . functional complementation in yeast indicated that zip proteins are able to transport various divalent cations, including fe2+, zn2+, mn2+, and cd2+ <cit> . the zip proteins consist of 309- <dig> amino acid residues with eight potential transmembrane domains and a similar membrane topology. there is also a variable region between tm- <dig> and tm- <dig>  in which the amino- and carboxyl-terminals located on the outside surface of plasma membrane. the variable region contains a potential metal-binding domain rich in conserved histidine residues  <cit> . several zip proteins have been identified in arabidopsis <cit> . atirt <dig>  was the first member to be identified through functional complementation of a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake, and it encodes a major fe transporter at the root surface in arabidopsis <cit> . further analysis showed that the irt <dig> mutant exhibited lethal chlorotic phenotypes  <cit> , and had lower ni accumulation under fe-deficient conditions than the wild type plants. these results indicated that atirt <dig> mediates fe and ni translocation in arabidopsis <cit> . likewise, overexpressing atirt <dig> leads to increased accumulation of zn in shoots and fe in roots. moreover, atirt <dig> could complement the zn and fe uptake double yeast mutants, indicating that atirt <dig> is involved in zn and fe translocation  <cit> . besides, expression analysis revealed that the transcripts of atzip <dig> to atzip <dig>  atzip <dig> to atzip <dig>  and atirt <dig> were increased in response to zn-deficiency, suggesting that they may enhance zn acquisition under deficient zn status in arabidopsis <cit> . in rice, overexpression of osirt <dig> leads to increased fe and zn accumulations in shoots, roots and mature seeds, suggesting osirt <dig> is a functional metal transporter for iron, and it is responsible for the absorption of iron from soil, especially under fe-deficiency  <cit> . on the contrary, over accumulation of oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> cannot increase the zn content in seeds, though the zn concentration in roots were dramatically increased in transgenic plants  <cit> . these results indicated that maintaining the endogenous expression pattern of zip genes may be essential for zn translocation in plants. likewise, overexpression of tdzip <dig>  a zn transporter from wild emmer wheat, causes excess accumulation of zn in cells, thus generating a toxic cytosolic environment  <cit> . therefore, increase zn content by transgenic approaches may benefit from elucidating the expression pattern of zip genes.

since zip is the key transporter for zn and fe uptake and translocation in plants, considerable progress has been achieved in cloning and characterizing its functions in crop plants, including soybean and maize  <cit> . the soybean gmzip <dig> is highly selective for zn, and it might play a role in the symbiotic relationship between soybean and bradyrhizobium japonicum <cit> . the zmzlp <dig>  was identified from a cdna library of zea mays l.  pollen. it was reported that zmzlp <dig> localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and may be responsible for transporting zinc from the er to the cytoplasm, though its physiological function has not been characterized  <cit> . the maize genome has been thoroughly sequenced and assembled. however, systematic analysis of the maize zip gene family is still limited. in the present study, we provide detailed information on the gene identification, chromosomal locations, subcellular localizations and expression patterns of nine zmzip genes. in addition, the transporter activities of zmzips were tested by yeast complementation analysis. our results suggest that zmzip genes may be responsible for the uptake and translocation of zn or fe and involve in detoxification and storage of metals in plant cells, as well as embryo and endosperm development.

RESULTS
cloning of zmzip genes and phylogenetic analysis
extensive searches of public genomic databases, by using reported zip proteins from rice as tblastn queries, identified a total of nine maize zip genes that have complete sequences. nine cdna fragments containing complete opening reading frame  were cloned from leaf tissues of maize  by rt-pcr, and they were designated as zmzip1- <dig> and zmirt <dig> according to the amino acid sequence similarity with the rice and arabidopsis . the predicted proteins of zmzips consist of 359- <dig> amino acids, and harbour 6- <dig> putative transmembrane  domains. in addition, there was a variable region between tm- <dig> and tm- <dig>  containing a potential metal-binding domain rich in histidine residues . the phylogenetic analysis showed that zmzip <dig> was closely related to atiar <dig> and osiar1; zmirt <dig> was related to hvirt <dig> and resided in a branch comprised by iron transporter osirt <dig> and osirt <dig>  it was suggested that the amino acid residue d <dig> in atirt <dig> is responsible for fe and mn transport  <cit> , and it is conserved in zmirt <dig> , which indicates that zmirt <dig> may be functional related to a fe transporter. in addition, zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> formed a gene cluster with oszip <dig> and oszip4; zmzip <dig> was most closely related to oszip <dig> in the other branch comprised by zinc transporters oszip <dig>  atzip <dig> and atzip11; zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> were observed in a branch; zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> were closely related to oszip <dig> and oszip <dig>  respectively . these results revealed that zmzips may be functional zn or fe transporters.

expression patterns of zmzip genes in different tissues of maize
recently, functional analysis has revealed that some zip genes in arabidopsis and rice play important roles in transporting zn or fe  <cit> . to better understand the physiological functions of zmzip genes, their expression patterns in seedlings , embryo and endosperm were investigated by real-time rt-pcr. under sufficient metal nutritional conditions, eight zmzip genes were mainly expressed in shoots, while zmirt <dig> was accumulated abundantly in both shoots and roots . in addition, the expression profiles of zmzip genes were determined in response to fluctuating divalent metal status. under zn-deficient conditions, the expression levels of zmirt <dig>  zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> were up-regulated in shoots at 96 h, whereas zmzip <dig> was induced in both shoots and roots at 6 h . the accumulation of zmirt <dig> was gradually increased in response to zn-excess in shoots and reached the maximum level at 96 h after treatment, while that was suppressed in roots. moreover, the expression of zmzip <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were suppressed and decreased gradually in shoots, while zmzip <dig> was down-regulated remarkably in roots . these results indicated that zmirt <dig>  zmzip <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are sensitive to fluctuating environmental zn status in seedlings.

under fe-deficient conditions, the expression of zmirt <dig> was dramatically up-regulated in shoots and roots. in response to fe-excess, the transcript level of zmirt <dig> was suppressed in shoots and roots, while that of zmzip <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were increased and reached to the maximum level at 96 h in both shoots and roots . these results indicated that zmirt <dig> and zmzip <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are sensitive to environmental fe conditions in shoots and roots. under cu- and mn-deficient conditions, the expression patterns of zmzip genes showed no obvious change .

a detailed analysis of the transcriptional profiles of zmzip genes along embryo and endosperm development of maize were measured by real-time rt-pcr. total rna was isolated from embryo and endosperm on indicated days after pollination  . the results revealed that the expression levels of zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> were up-regulated on  <dig> dap, while zmirt <dig> and zmzip <dig> were mainly expressed in the late developmental stages of embryo. moreover, the expression of zmzip <dig> was dramatically increased associated with endosperm development and reached a peak on  <dig> dap  . taken together, these results suggested that zmirt <dig>  zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> may play important roles during embryo development in maize, while zmzip <dig> may be essential for both embryo and endosperm development.

subcellular localization of zmzips
to study the localization of zmzip proteins, the full-length coding regions without termination codons of the zmzip genes were c-terminal fused with green fluorescent protein  and the fusion proteins were expressed under cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter. the zmzips-gfp fusion proteins were transiently expressed in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts and onion epidermal cells. the green fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy. as showed in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  all zmzip proteins were localized to the plasma membrane and endomembrane system, which was further identified as endoplasmic reticulum  by co-localization with an er marker in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . in addition, the gfp signal can be observed at the border of the cell, indicating the plasma membrane localization of zmzips . moreover, plasmolysis was performed to further confirm the plasma membrane localization . cells expressing gfp were used as controls, which showed green fluorescence in nucleus and cytoplasm.

complementation in yeast cells
the yeast complementation analysis was performed in order to test whether zmzips possess the capacity of transporting zn or fe in organisms. although, it was demonstrated that mn is a potential substrate for zips  <cit> , it has not been tested in this study. the full-length cdnas of zmzip genes were expressed in the saccharomyces cerevisiae zrt1zrt <dig> double mutant  and fet3fet <dig> double mutant . the transformed zhy <dig> expressing zmzip genes were grew on sd media plus  <dig>  mm edta. the result showed that the expression of zmirt <dig> protein remarkably reversed this growth defect in the yeast mutant, while other zmzips reversed this growth defect as efficiently as the functional characterized zip proteins, oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> . to test the iron transporter activity, the yeast mutants dey <dig> transformed with pfl61-zmzips were grown on sd media plus 50 mm mes. the result revealed that zmirt <dig> reversed the growth defect significantly, while the effect of other proteins were relatively inferior, though that was as efficiently as a reported iron transporter osirt <dig> . it was interesting to find that the yeast mutants expressing zmirt <dig> showed the strongest propagation under both zn- and fe-limited conditions , indicating that zmirt <dig> may be essential for zn and fe translocation during maize growth. in addition, except for zmirt <dig>  other zmzip proteins can complement the iron transporter mutant fet3fet <dig> at high ph but weakly at low ph conditions . thus, the zmzip genes identified in this study encoded functional zn or fe transporter, and zmirt <dig> may play a dominant role in ion translocation in maize.

discussion
the zip genes have been reported in several plants, including arabidopsis, rice, medicago truncatula, wild emmer wheat, vitis vinifera l and barley  <cit> . most of these genes are found to function as zn or fe transporter, though some zips have major roles in mn transport  <cit> . members of the zip family have eight predicted transmembrane  domains and a variable region between tm- <dig> and tm- <dig> where contains a potential metal-binding domain  <cit> . although zips have been characterized in many plants, to the best of our knowledge, there were few reports concerning the isolation and functional characterization of zips in maize. since, the maize genome sequencing project was completed, many gene families have been identified and characterized in maize  <cit> . in this study, nine cdnas encoding zmzip genes were obtained from maize based on amino acids sequences similarity. in order to analyze the evolutionary relationship of the zip family, a phylogenetic tree consists of nine zips and one zlp <dig> from maize,  <dig> rice zips ,  <dig> arabidopsis zips ,  <dig> hordeum vulgare zips ,  <dig> medicago truncatula zips , wild emmer wheat zip , and glycine max zip  was generated . it was revealed that the predicted amino acid sequences of zmzips were closely related to zips from other plant species and they were existed as orthologs , indicating that those zips from maize, rice and barley may share a common evolutionary ancestor. it has been reported that oszip <dig>  oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> are functional zinc transporters and localized to the plasma membrane  <cit> . atirt <dig> is an iron transporter and localized to intracellular vesicles, suggesting an essential role in preventing metal toxicity through compartmentalization and remobilize iron stores from internal storage vesicles  <cit> . all of these proteins are able to complement the growth of the yeast strain zhy <dig> or dey <dig>  which is sensitive to zn or fe deprivation due to the mutation in both high and low zn or fe affinity system. in this study, similar to the arabidopsis and rice zips, the maize zip proteins showed different degree of zinc or iron complementary capabilities . moreover, zmzips were localized to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum , suggesting they may functional related to excessive ion detoxification. hence, these results demonstrated that zmzip genes encode zn or fe transporters and have various functions associated with uptake and translocation, detoxification and storage of zn or fe in plant cells.

the expression patterns of zmzip genes reflect their diverse functions during zn or fe translocation. it has been reported that the zip genes displayed various expression profiles regarding tissue specificity and response to fluctuating environmental zn and fe conditions. for example, oszip7a was induced mainly in fe-deficient roots, while oszip <dig> was stimulated in zn-deficient shoots and roots  <cit> . histochemical localization analysis showed that the mrna of oszip <dig> was accumulated in the vascular bundles of leaves and roots, phloem cells of the stem and the meristems  <cit> . in the model legume medicago truncatula, the expression of mtzip <dig> was detected in roots and stems and was induced by zn deficiency  <cit> , likewise mtzip <dig> was expressed in zn-deficient roots and leaves  <cit> . in our study, the expression of zmirt <dig> was remarkably up-regulated in roots and shoots under fe-deficiency, and was induced in shoots at 96 h after zn-deficiency . zmzip <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were induced and reached a peak in shoots and roots at 96 h after fe-excess . these results suggested that zmirt <dig> may play essential roles in fe and zn uptake, especially under iron deficiency, while zmzip <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may associate with detoxification and storage of excessive fe. previous study showed that arabidopsis thaliana transcription factors bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> regulate the adaptation to zinc deficiency by increase the transcription of zips and other genes  <cit> . therefore, maize bzip-like transcription factors may be essential for the regulation of zmzip expression under zn deficient status.

it has been demonstrated that zn play essential roles in embryo and endosperm development  <cit> . therefore, the zmzip genes that preferentially expressed in embryo and endosperm may be important for translocation of zn2+ into sink organs. the expression analysis showed that zmirt <dig>  zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> were mainly expressed in embryo, while zmzip <dig> was expressed in both embryo and endosperm. the accumulations of zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> were up-regulated in the middle stages of embryo development and then they were repressed, suggesting that they may be essential for plumule and radicle growth. in contrast, zmirt <dig> and zmzip <dig> were stimulated in the late development stages of embryo, which indicates that they may associate with the maturation of embryo. interestingly, it was observed that the accumulation of zmzip <dig> was dramatically up-regulated during the development of endosperm and reached a peak on  <dig> dap, though its expression was decreased on  <dig> dap, which suggests that zmzip <dig> may involve in the accumulation of nutrient substance at early grain filling stage. by the light of well assembled genome sequence of maize, an in silico promoter analysis was performed for those zmzip genes preferentially expressed in embryo and endosperm. the results showed that the zmirt <dig>  zmzip <dig>  zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> contain cis-elements for seed expression . considering that there was some correlation between the vvzip <dig> expression profile and the zn accumulation pattern during the development of reproductive organs  <cit> , we assumed that zmirt <dig>  zmzip <dig>  zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> may play various roles in both embryo and endosperm development.

enhancing the iron and zinc content in cereal grains is important for improving human nutrition. since the amount of metal transporter is generally rate-limiting  <cit> , manipulating the transporters involved in translocation of micro-essential metals into sink organs could be a way to increase mineral contents. for instance, overexpressing atzip <dig> in barley resulted in a rise in the short-term zinc uptake as well as higher seed zn and fe contents  <cit> . likewise, the iron and zinc contents were elevated in the shoots, roots and mature seeds of transgenic rice constitutively overexpressing osirt <dig> <cit> . however, overexpressing oszip <dig> under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter lead to zn accumulation in roots, while the zn concentration in seeds were four times lower than untransgenic controls  <cit> . moreover, overexpressing oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> in rice under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter lead to increased zn level in roots, though that in shoots and mature seeds were reduced in the transgenic plants  <cit> . these results indicate that ectopic overexpression of zip proteins may have little effect on the enhancement of zn content in seeds due to overproduction of zip in vegetative tissues. therefore, increasing the accumulation of zip proteins and maintain their expression pattern may provide an alternative way to enhance zn or fe contents. since it was revealed that the expression of zmirt <dig>  zmzip <dig>  zmzip <dig> and zmzip <dig> are associated with seed development, it can be assumed that overexpression of these zip genes in a seed specific manner may provide an alternative strategy for biofortification of crops with zn and fe.

CONCLUSIONS
although zinc and iron are essential micronutrients for plant growth and development, functional analysis of zip family in maize is still limited. the present study provides relevant information concerning the identification and functional characterization of zmzip family, and suggests that they may involve in metal uptake and overall cell zinc homeostasis. it is also indicated that zmzips may be essential for ion translocation and storage during differential stages of embryo and endosperm development. in the present study, we provided detailed information of the evolutionary relationship and putative functional divergence of the zmzip gene family during the growth and development of maize.
