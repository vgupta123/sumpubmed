BACKGROUND
globally, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica is one of the leading food-borne pathogens. for example in  <dig> in the united states, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica caused  <dig>  registered cases of salmonellosis, corresponding to an incidence of  <dig> cases/ <dig>  inhabitants  <cit> . furthermore the actual number of infections is estimated to be  <dig> times higher  <cit> . in denmark, there were  <dig> registered cases of salmonellosis  in  <dig>  <cit> . salmonella serotype typhimurium, denoted s. typhimurium, accounted for 17% of the salmonellosis cases in the usa and 25% of the danish cases  <cit> . the outcome of human infection ranges from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to severe diarrhoea that requires hospitalization. in rare cases, often among immunocompromised patients, salmonellosis can be fatal.

several factors in both the host and the bacteria influence the outcome of an infection. clearly an important aspect of human infection is the immune state of the patient. it has been shown that immunocompromised patients are more prone to develop a severe infection  <cit> . another important aspect of human infection is the intestinal microbiota of the host. ingestion of antibiotics is known to affect the intestinal microbiota leaving the host more prone to infection and disease caused by s. typhimurium  <cit> .

significant bacterial factors for the outcome of infection are encoded by a wide range of genetic elements, including plasmids, prophages and salmonella pathogenicity islands . a total of  <dig> spis have been described so far  <cit> . spi- <dig> encodes type  <dig> secretion system  <dig>  that causes secretion and translocation of a range of bacterial proteins to the host cell. spi- <dig> encodes t3ss- <dig> that allows intracellular survival and replication  <cit> .

different s. typhimurium strains share more than 99% genomic content  <cit> . the detected variation within s. typhimurium is primarily represented by the prophages in the genome  <cit> . variation in phenotype has also been demonstrated as there are different phagetypes of s. typhimurium strains, and some of them can even show a high degree of variation in host adaptation  <cit> . intra-serotype variability is also caused by the plasmids carried by s. typhimurium, in particular, the salmonella virulence plasmid  which was observed more frequently in the strains isolated from blood than the strains isolated from faeces  <cit> . it has been proposed that this plasmid is significant in the spreading of an infectious strain from the intestine  <cit> .

the recent development of microarray technology has allowed an extensive screening of many s. typhimurium strains  <cit> , but to our knowledge, no study has been able to link the molecular data obtained by microarray analysis of the strains to detailed epidemiological and clinical patient data.

we analyzed a collection of s. typhimurium strains by dna microarray analysis. these strains were selected on the basis of a previous epidemiological study where clinical data were obtained by means of patient interviews. the strains were selected from patients with mild infections and from patients with severe infections, and clinical data allowed us to correct for known underlying diseases and patient age. strains were analyzed for presence or absence of  <dig> genes covering marker groups of genes related to pathogenicity, phages, antimicrobial resistance, fimbriae, mobility, serotype, and metabolism. we show that s. typhimurium strains causing very different symptoms in patients had little genomic variation, and the observed variation does not correlate to the severity of disease.

RESULTS
subtyping
all strains were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , multiple-locus variable-number of tandem-repeat analysis  and multilocus sequence typing . in general, the pfge types of the strains correspond to the phagetype. all of the phagetype dt <dig> strains had the pfge  <dig> profile and five out of six dt <dig> strains had the pfge  <dig> profile. the remaining phagetypes showed different pfge profiles .

the mlva types of the strains were all different. loci sttr- <dig> and sttr- <dig> were the most conserved alleles and they had  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> repeat units. sttr- <dig>  sttr- <dig> and sttr- <dig> were all alleles with varying repeat units. some strains did not contain the sttr- <dig> allele at all, corresponding well to the fact that these strains were not carrying the pslt .

the sequence types  of the strains were primarily st <dig>  only three strains had other sts and these were st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> .

dna microarray marker groups resistance and serotyping
the dna microarray included  <dig> probes that targeted  <dig> different resistance genes and some of their known variants. the phenotypic resistance profiles all corresponded to the results obtained by the array . the dna microarray included  <dig> probes that target different o-serogroups and h-antigens. the s. typhimurium serotype was confirmed by the array .

dna microarray marker groups metabolism, prophage and mobility
the dna microarray contained  <dig> probes targeting different genes in the metabolism marker group. all strains on the array possessed  <dig> of the  <dig> metabolism genes. the gene sen <dig>  which has been observed in serotypes s. enteritidis, s. dublin and s. gallinarum and the gene sty <dig>  which has been found in serotypes s. typhi and s. paratyphi a, were not detected in any of the s. typhimurium strains.

the dna microarray contained  <dig> probes targeting different genes in the prophage marker group. prophage related genes showed different present/absent profiles in different strains. all dt <dig> strains displayed identical profiles within the prophage marker group. only dt <dig> strains possessed the orf <dig> marker. the prophage genes sb <dig> and sb <dig> were present in all dt <dig> strains and some other strains. the genes sty <dig>  sty <dig> and sty <dig> were present in both dt <dig> strains and one of three rdnc strains. the remaining genes in the prophage marker group were identically present/absent in all strains .

the dna microarray contained  <dig> probes targeting different genes in the mobility marker group which also included plasmid incompatibility markers and is-element markers. the markers showed high variability in the present/absent pattern among all strains. the variability correlated well with known properties of strains, e.g. all strains lacking the pslt, also lacked the gene encoding the typical fiia replicon of pslt, and these strains also lacked the trat gene that is encoded in pslt .

dna microarray marker groups pathogenicity and fimbrial
the pathogenicity marker group consisted of  <dig> markers and the strains had a highly similar pattern of present/absent genes within this marker group. only the dt <dig> strains showed variation, as they lacked the gipa gene encoded by the gifsy- <dig> prophage but harboured the two other genes encoded by gifsy- <dig>  the dt <dig> strains also possessed two other prophage-related genes which no other strains possessed. all strains harboured prophage gifsy- <dig> and lacked prophages gifsy- <dig> and fels- <dig>  five strains of five different phagetypes lacked the pslt and, therefore, lacked the virulence genes encoded in the plasmid. in total, 72% of the strains in this study carried the pslt. the same percentage is observed when comparing all of the s. typhimurium strains detected in denmark between  <dig> and  <dig> .

the spi- <dig> to spi- <dig> were present and spi- <dig> was absent in all strains .

the dna microarray contained  <dig> probes targeting different genes in the fimbrial marker group. all strains showed identical patterns within this marker group, except for the pefa gene which is encoded in the pslt. one strain carrying the pslt did not show a positive reaction in the pefa probe .

clustering of strains
the microarray analysis clustered the strains into four major branches in a dendrogram . the dendrogram is calculated from all markers except the resistance and serotyping markers as these could create a bias in the analysis. cluster a had a depth of  <dig> % and contained most of the dt <dig> strains but also other phagetypes. the strains in cluster a all harboured the pslt, and all seven strains were fully sensitive to antimicrobial agents . in cluster a, two strains represented severe infection, four strains represented mild infection, and there was one outbreak strain. cluster b had a depth of  <dig> % and contained all six dt <dig> strains, which all harboured the pslt. two of the dt <dig> strains were fully susceptible to antimicrobial agents. in cluster b, two strains represented severe infection, two strains represented mild infection, and additionally there were two outbreak strains.

cluster c had a depth of  <dig> % and contained only three strains of three different phagetypes. all of the three strains carried the pslt and showed resistance to at least four antimicrobial agents. the strains in cluster c branch off separately as they possess more genes from the mobility marker group which includes transposases. in cluster c, two strains represented severe infection and one strain represented mild infection. cluster d had a depth of  <dig> % and contained five strains of different phagetypes, including a dt <dig> strain, but none of the strains harboured the pslt. one strain in cluster d showed resistance to three antimicrobial agents. in cluster d, three strains represented severe infection while two strains represented mild infection. in conclusion, strains causing severe and mild infection were represented equally across the dendrogram .

discussion
a collection of s. typhimurium strains were analyzed and compared by the use of a microarray designed for characterization of salmonella. the array consisted of  <dig> markers covering marker groups of genes related to pathogenicity, phages, antimicrobial resistance, fimbriae, mobility, serotype, and metabolism. extensive background knowledge of patients regarding symptoms and underlying diseases enabled us to compare strains causing mild symptoms to strains causing severe symptoms.

initial subtyping of the strains was performed using mlst and mlva. these two methods target different parts of the chromosome and areas with different genetic variability, leading to differences in the discriminatory power of the methods. mlva methods are generally high-discriminatory typing methods developed for outbreak investigations, and the s. typhimurium mlva method used in this study was specifically developed to differentiate the highly similar dt <dig> clone  <cit> . this method is based on highly variable repeat regions on the chromosome and on a plasmid. mlst is developed to estimate long term development and is based on conserved housekeeping genes with minimal variation  <cit> . most strains in this study belonged to st <dig>  except for three strains with different sts. the difference between st <dig> and each of the other sts was a single nucleotide change in one allele, so the similarity of the strains was high as expected with mlst. the strains all had different mlva profiles, corresponding well with the fact that mlva is a more discriminatory typing method and the strains were selected to be epidemiologically unrelated.

the strains were tested for antimicrobial resistance and eight of  <dig> strains showed resistance to three or more antimicrobial agents. three strains from the group with mild symptoms, four strains from the group with severe symptoms, and a single outbreak strain showed resistance to antimicrobial agents. the resistance pattern did not correlate with the severity of disease in patients. the lack of increased virulence of resistant strains has previously been shown in dt <dig> strains  <cit> . an american study described that humans who ingested antimicrobials are more prone to get a subsequent infection with a resistant s. typhimurium strain  <cit> . two of the patients included in our study were administered antimicrobials within a month before onset of the s. typhimurium infection, one patient was in the group with severe symptoms and the other patient was in the group with mild symptoms. both infections were caused by resistant s. typhimurium strains.

differences between the s. typhimurium strains were detected in the prophage marker group. the dt <dig> strains were different as seen by detection of the orf <dig> marker, previously shown to be present primarily in dt <dig> strains  <cit> . the salmonella prophage st64b  was detected in different phagetypes in this study, but notably this prophage is present in all dt <dig> strains, and these observations corresponded to previous findings  <cit> . other genes showing variability within the prophage marker group were the s. typhi specific genes sty <dig>  sty <dig> and sty <dig>  the markers of these genes were detected in three s. typhimurium strains. the occurrence of these genes could be explained by lacking specificity of the probe, or by point mutations in the s. typhimurium strains leading to cross-hybridization. prophages are known to contribute to virulence in mice  <cit>  but presence or absence of prophages does not correlate with any differences in symptoms caused by strains in our study investigating strains isolated from humans.

the mobility marker group also displayed variation between strains, but most variation related to incompatibility groups of plasmids and probes encoding transposons. the variation did not correspond to any phagetypes or disease symptoms.

the strains showed highly similar profiles when comparing the virulence associated genes. some variation was detected between other phagetypes and the dt <dig> strains which were the only strains containing the hldd gene and the irsa gene, but these genes have previously been shown to be specific for the dt <dig> phagetype  <cit> . also the gifsy- <dig> encoded genes showed variation between other phagetypes and the dt <dig> strains, as the dt <dig> strains lacked one of three gifsy- <dig> encoded genes present on the array. the gene lacking in our dt <dig> strains is consistent with an observation made recently in a study comparing the genome sequence of a dt <dig> strain to a s. typhimurium lt <dig> strain  <cit> . the study observes a prophage sequence in dt <dig> which only shows partly homology to the gifsy- <dig> prophage sequence. all other strains in our study possessed the gifsy- <dig> prophage. the spi- <dig> to spi- <dig> were present in all strains but the spi- <dig> was absent. spi- <dig> was initially reported in a s. typhi  <cit> , and similar islands were detected in s. dublin and s. paratyphi c  <cit> . the pslt is another important virulence marker. in an american study, pslt was shown to be present in 76% of strains isolated from blood compared to 42% of strains isolated from faeces  <cit> , however, in the present study the virulence plasmid was present in 72% of the strains, even though the strains were all isolated from faeces and some strains caused very mild disease symptoms. the selected s. typhimurium strains are representative for the danish s. typhimurium population regarding the presence of pslt, as 72% of all danish s. typhimurium isolates from  <dig> until  <dig> carried the plasmid. out of five strains lacking the pslt, three had caused severe symptoms. interestingly, strains can cause infection with severe symptoms even if they lack the plasmid. furthermore, strains can carry the pslt and only cause infection with mild symptoms. in this study, the presence or absence of pslt did not correspond to any phagetypes or disease symptoms.

the dendrogram calculated on the basis of the array results showed clustering of the strains into four groups. the clustering confirmed dt <dig> as being a clonal phagetype, but a number of probes were also designed to target only dt <dig> strains, and that might emphasize the separate clustering of this phagetype. the clustering of the remaining groups was mainly correlated to the presence or absence of the pslt and other mobile elements such as transposons. the four clusters in the tree represented an almost equal amount of strains causing severe or mild symptoms of s. typhimurium infections.

the probes on the array were designed primarily on basis of the s. typhimurium lt <dig> sequence, but also some additional known genes from other serotypes such as s. enteritidis and s. typhi. the presence or absence of additional s. typhimurium genes, which are not present in the lt <dig> sequence, could not be assessed in this study. it is possible that the presence or absence of such genes, not present in lt <dig>  are responsible for the observed differences in the patient symptoms. although this is not likely, as recent publications of sequenced s. typhimurium strains showed few gene differences to the lt <dig> sequenced strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we investigated a collection of salmonella strains for the presence of a wide range of known virulence genes, and detected no significant difference in the presence of these genes. the investigated strains were carefully selected, based on epidemiological data, to represent strains causing severe symptoms of disease and strains causing mild symptoms of disease. although the investigated strains had different genomic contents, this study found no evidence of a correlation between the genomic contents of the s. typhimurium strains and the symptoms they caused in human cases of salmonellosis. based on the results of this study, an idea which immediately suggests itself is that the factors and defence mechanisms of the host immune system may play a fundamental role in the different outcomes of infection.
