BACKGROUND
the molecular basis for cellular recognition of signal molecules is their binding to specific cell surface receptors  <cit> . despite large structural differences between the huge numbers of extracellular ligands, many bind to  specific receptors belonging to a large family of pertussis toxin-sensitive g-protein linked receptors   <cit> . these receptors possess a high degree of similarity and although activated by different agonists, they transduce downstream signals that have many common features  <cit> . nevertheless, it is clear that there are also important differences between receptor-ligand pairs regarding their functional repertoire  <cit> . the pattern recognition, formyl peptide receptor  family, belongs to the larger gpcr group of chemoattractant receptors  <cit> . the fpr gene family has a complex evolutionary history and the number, function, and specific cell expression of genes comprising the family vary considerably between different mammalian species  <cit> . human neutrophil granulocytes express two fpr members  <cit> , the fpr and the fprl <dig> . fprl <dig> was originally defined as an orphan receptor, cloned from an hl- <dig> cell cdna library by low-stringency hybridization with the fpr sequence  <cit> . in the past few years several neutrophil activating ligands specific for fprl <dig> have been identified  <cit> , but knowledge on the precise functional activities and the signal transduction pathways utilized by fprl <dig> are still somewhat limited. in contrast to fprl <dig>  a large number of studies on fpr induced cell function and signaling have been performed in neutrophils and in receptor-expressing transfected cell lines. these studies reveal that fpr signaling shows all the basic characteristic of a gpcr. binding of the prototype fpr agonist fmlf to its receptor initiates a chain of events starting with dissociation of the g-protein α subunit from its βγ subunit. these subunits directly or indirectly activate downstream signaling molecules such as protein kinase c , mitogen-activated protein kinase , and phosphoinositide 3-kinase  that uses the membrane phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  as substrate  <cit> . the dissociated subunits of the g-protein also activate the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c  that upon cleavage of pip <dig> produces the second messengers responsible for an elevation of intracellular free calcium  <cit> . it has been assumed that fprl <dig> shares signal transduction features with fpr, since both receptors are sensitive to pertussis toxin and possess a high degree of amino acid identity in the signaling cytoplasmic domains  <cit> . further, the functional responses induced by the fprl <dig> specific hexapeptide agonist wkymvm is in most respects similar to  those induced by the prototype fpr agonist fmlf  <cit> . however, in this study we have used a membrane permeant polyphosphoinositide-binding peptide  derived from the cytoskeletal protein gelsolin, and we show that with respect to messengers generated by the these receptors leading to mobilization of secretory granules and nadph-oxidase activation, two totally different signaling routes are used by fpr and fprl <dig>  one being sensitive  the other insensitive  to the pip2-binding peptide.

RESULTS
nadph-oxidase activity induced by fmlf and wkymvm and effects of pbp10
the peptides fmlf and wkymvm, agonists for fpr and fprl <dig>  respectively, both induced a robust oxidative burst measured as a release of superoxide anions . in accordance with the known receptor specificity  <cit> , the wkymvm response was totally inhibited by the fprl <dig> specific antagonist wrwwww whereas the fpr specific antagonist was without effect. the effects were reversed for fmlf-triggered activity, that is, this response was totally inhibited by cyclosporine h but not affected by wkwwww . the time-courses of the responses were very similar, as were the ec <dig> values . both the fpr and fprl <dig> mediated response was inhibited by pertussis toxin , showing that a heterotrimeric g-protein is involved in the signal transduction of both receptors . these indistinguishable responses were expected, based on the fact that the two receptors are very similar in the regions suggested to be of importance for intracellular signaling.

despite the indistinguishable activation by fpr and fprl <dig> shown in fig. 1a–c, functional differences between these two highly homologous receptors emerge when they are treated with the membrane permeant polyphosphoinositide-binding peptide rhodamine-b-qrlfqvkgrr  prior to activation. the neutrophil nadph-oxidase activity was totally inhibited by pbp <dig> when fprl <dig> was stimulated by wkymvm, whereas there was no effect of the peptide on the fmlf-induced, fpr-mediated neutrophil response. the ic <dig> value for the wkymvm induced response was around  <dig>  μm whereas no effect was seen on the fmlf induced activity even at concentrations up to  <dig> μm. there was no effect on wkymvm or fmlf induced superoxide production of rhodamine alone .

the neutrophil response is inhibited by wortmannin
the amino acid sequence of pbp  <dig> peptide corresponds to the phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  binding region segment  <dig> of the cytoskeletal protein gelsolin  <cit> . following g-protein coupled receptor  activation, the dissociated g-protein subunits activate the downstream phosphoinositide remodeling enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase   <cit> , an enzyme that uses the membrane phosphoinositide pip <dig> as substrate to generate the signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate   <cit> . the oxidase activity induced by fmlf as well as by wkymvm was largely inhibited by the specific pi3k inhibitor wortmannin  suggesting that this signaling pathway is of importance in the cellular response. in contrast to the effect of pbp <dig>  the effects of the pi3k inhibitor showed no specificity in the inhibition of the wkymvm/fprl <dig> triggered response.

pbp  <dig> inhibits the response to fprl <dig> but not to fpr
the inhibition induced by pbp <dig> on neutrophil oxidase activity was linked to the receptor fprl <dig> rather than to an fprl1-specific agonist, since the same inhibition pattern was obtained when wkymvm was replaced by serum amyloid a  , an agonist that activates cells through binding to fprl <dig>  <cit> . moreover, no effect was induced by pbp <dig> when fmlf was replaced by annexini9– <dig> , a  <dig> amino acid peptide derived from the n-terminus of annexin i that has been shown to be a fpr agonist . moreover, the cellular responses mediated through other receptors, such as the chemokine receptor cxc or the c5a-receptor were not affected by pbp <dig> .

the membrane permeability of pbp <dig> is necessary for fprl <dig> inhibition
interaction of pbp <dig> with pip <dig> depends on the peptide sequence, as truncation of the peptide either at the n terminus or c terminus reduces the pip <dig> binding affinity  <cit> . accordingly, rh-vkgrrg affected the oxidase activity induced by wkymvm only when higher concentrations of peptide were used  suggesting that pip <dig> binding is of importance for inhibition of the neutrophil oxidase response induced by fprl <dig> 

the pbp <dig> peptide possesses not only pip <dig> binding capacity but is also membrane permeable. this feature has been shown to be coupled to the rhodamine b part of the molecule, i.e., the unconjugated peptide qrlfqvkgrr exhibits the same pip2-binding characteristics as pbp <dig> but lacks the ability to cross the plasma membrane  <cit> . the unconjugated peptide had no effect on the wkymvm induced neutrophil oxidase activity  suggesting that membrane permeation is required for peptide-induced inhibition.

no effect of pbp <dig> on the transient calcium response
pip <dig> is utilized for generation of ip <dig> that induces a transient increase in intracellular calcium  <cit> , we thus investigated the effect of pbp <dig> on the neutrophil calcium response. stimulating the cells with fmlf or wkymvm induced a rapid and transient increase in cytosolic calcium. these responses were not significantly reduced by the removal of extracellular ca2+ with egta , suggesting that the rise in intracellular free ca2+ relates to a mobilization from calcium storing organelles rather then from an influx through ion channels in the plasma membrane. treatment of the cells with pbp <dig> prior to stimulation did not alter the calcium responses, neither induced by fmlf nor by wkymvm . hence, the pbp10-induced effect on fprl <dig> signaling is not due to a specific inhibition of the calcium transients induced by the activated gpcrs.

pbp <dig> inhibits mobilization of cr3
the ca2+ elevation has been claimed to be required but not sufficient for the generation of an nadph-oxidase activating signal from fpr  <cit> . likewise, the mobilization through regulated exocytosis of neutrophil secretory storage organelles containing reserve pools of cell-surface receptors  <cit>  has been suggested to be directly regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free ca2+  <cit> . we found that despite the fact that pbp <dig> was without effect on the transient rise in intracellular ca2+ induced by wkymvm, it blocked the secretory response . in accordance with the inhibition of the nadph-oxidase activity, pbp <dig> was without effect on the fpr induced granule mobilization . this suggests that degranulation and nadph-oxidase activity induced by fprl <dig> both are on the same, pbp10-sensitive, signal transduction pathway in contrast to fpr, which induces both cellular functions by a pbp10-insensitive pathway.

regulation by the cytoskeleton
regulation of fpr signaling has been suggested to involve mechanisms that depend on direct receptor interaction with the membrane cytoskeleton  <cit> . it is well known that the neutrophil response to fpr and fprl <dig> agonists is both augmented and prolonged in the presence of cytochalasin b  <cit> , a fungal metabolite that inhibits re-organization of actin polymers and uncouples receptors from the cytoskeleton  <cit> .

to investigate the involvement of cytoskeleton in the pbp10-sensitive signal transduction pathway, neutrophils were treated with cytochalasin b prior to activation by a receptor agonist . interestingly, the receptor selectivity of pbp10's inhibitory effect was lost when the receptors were first uncoupled from the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin b . in accordance with the findings reported above, the nadph-oxidase activity induced by wkymvm was largely inhibited by pbp <dig> also in the presence of cytochalasin b. however, the drug introduced a pbp <dig> sensitivity also in the fpr-induced response. the inhibition of the fpr-mediated response required higher concentrations of pbp <dig>  and the response was only partly inhibited suggesting that the pbp10-insensitive as well as the pbp10-sensitive signaling pathways were triggered simultaneously during activation of fpr uncoupled from the cytoskeleton. the transient rise in intracellular calcium induced by the active receptors was not affected by cytochalasin b . in conclusion, both fprl <dig> and fpr appear to possess the ability to activate neutrophils via a signaling route that is sensitive to pbp <dig>  but that this signaling pathway normally is blocked for fpr, through association of the receptor with the cytoskeleton.

discussion
the two formyl peptide receptor family members fpr and fprl <dig> possess a high degree of amino acid identity in the signaling cytoplasmic domains  <cit> , and the cell functions induced by the fpr and fprl <dig> agonists are in most respects identical  <cit> . the indistinguishable responses of activated fpr and fprl <dig> respectively, are expected, based on the fact that the two receptors are very similar in the regions suggested to be of importance for their interaction with the signaling, pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric g-protein. dysfunctional variant fpr alleles  have been described that are associated with juvenile periodontitis and a deficiency in g-protein coupling  <cit> , but fprl <dig> contains the functional amino acids of fpr both in position  <dig> and in  <dig>  other g-protein coupling structures, identified through expression of different fpr mutants, suggest that the n-terminal part of the second transmembrane domain  and the c-terminal interface of the third transmembrane domain  may be sites of interaction between the receptor and the g-protein  <cit> . in fprl <dig> all but one of the amino acids in these suggested interaction sites are identical with those in fpr, and the signal-regulating npxxy motif in the seven transmembrane domain  is identical  in the two receptors. the exception is the serine in position  <dig> that in fprl <dig> is replaced by a cysteine, but this difference seems to be of minor importance with respect to the effect of pertussis toxin, since both receptors are sensitive to the toxin.

despite the indistinguishable activation by fpr and fprl <dig>  functional differences between these two highly homologous receptors emerge when they are challenged by the membrane permeant polyphosphoinositide-binding peptide pbp <dig>  prior to activation. the fprl1-mediated neutrophil activity was totally inhibited by the peptide pbp <dig> whereas there was no effect on fpr-mediated responses. as mentioned, the amino acids in the pbp  <dig> peptide correspond to the pip <dig> binding region segment  <dig> of the cytoskeletal protein gelsolin  <cit> . one of the enzymes competing with pbp <dig> for pip <dig> would be the phosphoinositide remodeling enzyme pi3k that converts pip <dig> into phosphatidylinositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate  which is of importance for cell locomotion and the associated dynamic reorganization of cytoskeletal components. the precise target for pip <dig> has however not yet been defined  <cit> . the inhibition of neutrophil function by wortmannin, an inhibitor of pi3k, suggests that this signaling pathway is of importance for the nadph-oxidase activity but the pi3k inhibitor lacked receptor specificity  and we can thus rule out that the mechanism behind the pbp <dig> effect is a direct interference with the pi3k pathway.

the basic properties of pbp  <dig> have been described earlier  <cit> , and it has been shown that when coupled to rhodamine b the peptide possesses not only pip <dig> binding activity but also crosses the cell membrane of neutrophils and other cells. interaction of rhodamine labeled peptides with pip <dig> depends on the peptide sequence, and truncation of the peptide reduces the pip <dig> binding affinity  <cit> . the truncated peptides were still membrane permeable and affected the oxidase activity only at higher concentrations. the unconjugated peptide qrlfqvkgrr exhibiting the same pip2-binding characteristics as pbp <dig> but lacking the ability to cross the plasma membrane  <cit>  had no effect on neutrophil oxidase activity. taken together these data suggest that membrane permeation is required and pip <dig> binding is of importance for peptide-induced inhibition.

plasma membrane localized pip <dig> is utilized for generation of ip <dig> which in turn is responsible for inducing transients in intracellular calcium  <cit> . triggering of cells with fmlf or wkymvm induced a rapid and transient increase in cytosolic calcium, but pbp <dig> did not have any inhibitory effect on the calcium transient. the ca2+ elevation has been claimed to be required but not sufficient for the generation of an nadph-oxidase activating signal from fpr  <cit> . likewise the mobilization of granule localized reserve pools of cell-surface receptors  <cit> , has been suggested to be directly regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free ca2+  <cit> . these experimental evidences rely, however, on methods that cannot distinguish a dependency on basal ca2+ levels from a requirement for a ca2+ transient, and we have earlier shown that receptor mobilization can occur and the oxidase can be activated without any transient rise in cytosolic ca2+  <cit> . despite the fact that pbp <dig> was without effect on the transient rise in intracellular ca2+ induced by wkymvm, the secretory response was blocked and pbp <dig> selectively inhibited the fprl <dig> induced granule mobilization.

the gpcr family is very diverse and the transmission of signals by such receptors is a critical function in many cell/organ systems. signaling through gpcrs is highly complex, evidently not only with respect to the wide variety of mechanisms that regulate different functional responses  <cit> , but also with respect to the pathways used to regulate a defined cellular response through closely related receptors. the two fpr and fprl <dig> genes, although originating from a common ancestral gene, appear to have undergone markedly different evolutionary events  <cit> . in contrast to fpr, which is characterized by a relatively high degree of single nucleotide polymorphism , no fprl <dig> polymorphism has been found. only one of the fpr polymorphisms is located in the cytoplasmic regions; and the variant  has the same amino acid in that position in the cytoplasmic tail as fprl <dig>  a direct comparison of the amino acid sequences of fpr and fprl <dig> reveal very small differences between the receptors in all intracellular domains except for the c-terminal tail. in the first intracellular loop the h <dig> in fpr is replaced by an r  in fprl <dig>  in the second loop differences are found in v <dig> → i and t <dig> → a, and in the third loop the q <dig> → k and l <dig> → m exchanges are found. the only major differences between the two receptors are found in the cytoplasmic c-terminal tail in which  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acids differ, and it is worth noting that the amino acid exchange in nine of the positions that differ between fpr and fprl <dig> are potential targets for phosphorylation. five potential phosphorylation sites, suggested to be of importance for arrestin-binding and receptor desensitization in fpr  <cit> , are missing in fprl <dig> while two new sites have been added in this receptor. it seems reasonable to assume that the signaling route that is sensitive to pbp <dig> originates from this region of the fprl <dig> receptor. despite the fact that the differences between fpr and fprl <dig> are limited, the identification of putative sites in fprl <dig> of importance for the pbp <dig> sensitivity cannot be achieved through experiments performed with receptor chimeras, site-directed receptor mutants or deletions, since no cells equipped with the required effector functions are available for expression of the receptors.

regulation of fpr signaling has been suggested to involve mechanisms that depend on direct receptor interaction with the membrane cytoskeleton  <cit> . it is well known that the neutrophil response to fpr and fprl <dig> agonists is both augmented and prolonged in the presence of cytochalasin b  <cit> , a drug that inhibits re-organization of actin polymers and uncouples the receptors from the cytoskeleton  <cit> . the cytoskeleton is part of the signaling modulating machinery and we show that the receptor selectivity of the pbp <dig> inhibitory effect was lost when the receptors were uncoupled from the cytoskeleton. in accordance with the earlier described findings, the nadph-oxidase activity induced by wkymvm was largely inhibited by pbp <dig> also in the presence of cytochalasin b, but the drug introduced this sensitivity when fmlf was used as the triggering agent. the inhibition of the fpr-mediated response required higher concentrations of pbp <dig>  and the response was only partly inhibited suggesting that the pbp10-insensitive as well as pbp10-sensitive signaling pathways were activated simultaneously by fpr's uncoupled from the cytoskeleton. it is interesting to note that when fpr was uncoupled from the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin b, pbp <dig> affected the sustained generation of superoxide but not the initial rate of production. this suggests that different signals are responsible for the triggering of the oxidase in the early and late phases of the response, respectively. it is reasonable to assume that the pbp <dig> sensitive signal generated by the uncoupled fpr is identical to that generated by fprl <dig>  however, we cannot at present exclude the possibility that also a novel fpr-triggered pathway is blocked by pbp <dig>  the transient rise in intracellular calcium induced by the active receptors was not affected by cytochalasin b , suggesting that this signaling route does not depend on interaction with the cytoskeleton. a possible explanation for the effects when pbp <dig> and cytochalasin b are combined is that signaling g-proteins compete with cytoskeletal proteins for the same site on fpr, and that this interaction involves a region of the receptor that differs between fpr and fprl <dig>  a  <dig> amino acid long sequence in fpr  has a fairly high  identity with the actin-binding cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and coronin, and this region also participates in fpr interaction with the g-protein  <cit> . it is of interest to notice that the amino acid sequence in this region of fprl <dig> differs from that of fpr in five positions and four of these are  potential phosphorylation sites. phagocytes express predominantly the giα <dig> complex of the pertussis toxin sensitive g-proteins and, to a lesser extent giα <dig>  <cit> . the molecular mechanism behind the difference in sensitivity to pbp <dig> between fpr and fprl <dig> could possibly be that the receptors couple to different g-protein subtypes. fpr has, however, been shown to couple to both g-protein subtypes with similar efficiency  <cit> . it is however important to note that these experiments were performed in receptor-expressing cells in which nothing is known about the linkage between the receptors and the cytoskeleton and in which the proper cell function repertoire is missing.

the relation of the biochemical/biophysical activities of the pbp <dig> peptide to its effect on the fprl1-triggered cell function is not obvious and is likely to be complex. the sensitivity to pbp <dig> seems to be unique to fprl <dig>  but this receptor is expressed also in other cells such as astrocytes, neuroblastoma, and microglia cells  <cit> . fpr is also expressed in other cell types and whether the receptor selectivity/specificity of pbp <dig> is maintained in other cells remains to be determined. the biochemical/biophysical characterization of the ten strategically organized basic and hydrophobic amino acids of the gelsolin molecule included in pbp <dig> reveal that it may interact with a broad range of negatively charged phosphomonoesters and hydrophobic acyl chains of anionic phospholipids  <cit> . this suggests that in addition to blocking/competing activities which involve proteins that are regulated by cellular phosphoinositides, the peptide may function as a buffer of bioactive and signaling lipids. although elucidation of the step in signal transduction that is disrupted by pbp <dig> requires much additional work, the receptor-specific and signal-selective effects of this peptide on neutrophil functions suggest that it has a potential as a tool to manipulate and help define how gpcrs produce and integrate the signals generated from activated receptors and to probe new signaling functions of polyphosphoinositides as well as defining the role as promotor/blocker of g-protein signaling of different cytoskeletal proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the neutrophil formyl peptide receptor family members fpr and fprl <dig> share 69% of amino acid identity and mediate almost indistinguishable cellular responses. thus, the assumption that fpr and fprl <dig> use the same signaling pathways has been generally accepted. however, in this study we clearly demonstrate a fundamental difference in intracellular signaling between these two very closely related neutrophil formyl peptide receptor members, one being pbp <dig> sensitive and the other not. this novel pbp <dig> sensitive signaling pathway utilized by fprl <dig> is also used by fpr but only when the cytoskeleton network is disrupted.
