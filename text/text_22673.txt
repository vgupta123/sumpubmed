BACKGROUND
plant cellular and developmental processes are significantly affected by many environmental conditions, e.g. drought, cold, high salinity, flood, submergence, pathogen attack and hormone stress  <cit> , and the processes are regulated by various transcription factors   <cit> . the apetala2/ethylene response factor  gene family is one of the most important plant transcription factor families  <cit> . ap2/erf genes contain one to two ap2/erf domains comprising 60– <dig> conserved amino acid residues  <cit>  and perform important regulatory functions in plant stress defence. in arabidopsis,  <dig> ap2/erf genes have been characterized and are divided among five families  <cit> : those containing two ap <dig> domains , one ap <dig> domain and an ethylene-responsive factor domain , one ap <dig> domain and a dehydration-responsive element-binding protein domain , one ap <dig> domain and one b <dig> domain , and the soloists  <cit> . the ap2/erf super-family has been recently studied in various plants, e.g. bamboo  <cit> , grape  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , rice  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , peach  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , chinese cabbage  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> .

the ap2/erf family is known to have important functions in plant growth and development, as well as in abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> . ap <dig> subfamily members regulate seed abscission zone  <cit> , petal  <cit> , ovule  <cit> , and leaf epidermal cell identity  <cit> , as well as flower development and seed growth  <cit> . the erf subfamily has specific functions in the regulation of abscission zone development  <cit>  and biotic stress response  <cit> . the dreb subfamily is involved in drought  <cit> , cold  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , water-deficit  <cit> , heat and osmotic stress response  <cit> . the rav subfamily functions in the ethylene response  <cit> . four ap2/erf genes have been implicated in abscission: sha <dig> in rice  <cit> , slerf.b <dig>  <cit>  and slerf <dig>  <cit>  in tomato, and fuf <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . sha <dig> and fuf <dig> both function in az development, whereas the two tomato genes function in az breakdown.

cassava  is the most important root crop in the world as more than  <dig> million people depend on cassava for staple food  <cit> . cassava plants have obvious abscission zone structures in their leaf pulvinus-petioles , which facilitate their high drought tolerance as the abscission zones control the inflexible leaf abscission mechanism . when subjected to prolonged adverse environmental conditions, cassava adapt to the new environment by shedding some old leaves, resulting in substantially reduced root yield in adverse environments  <cit> . when water becomes available, the crop can recover by rapidly forming new canopy leaves with substantially increased photosynthetic rates compared with unstressed crops, compensating for yield losses and producing final yields approaching those of well-watered crops  <cit> . cassava plants require a flexible leaf abscission mechanism. many abscission-related ap2/erf genes have been identified in arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , rice  <cit> , melon  <cit>  and apple  <cit> ; however, no studies have identified and characterized cassava abscission zone ap2/erf super-family members.

this study surveyed the ap2/erf family members using phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> cassava ap2/erf genes, and expression profile analysis indicated that  <dig> and  <dig> ap2/erf genes were expressed during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, respectively. comparative analysis of ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission suggested that the expression of  <dig> ap2/erf genes in response both treatments resulted in leaf abscission. sota clustering indicated that ap2/erf genes exhibited similar expression patterns during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, and the putative promoters of the genes were examined for motifs. additionally, acc oxidase activities were measured at various time points for both treatments. the important ap2/erf genes were further studied in two cassava cultivars that exhibit different levels of leaf abscission when subjected to the same stress. together, the data suggest that erf subfamily genes regulate the progression of cassava leaf abscission.

RESULTS
cassava ap2/erf gene identification
one hundred and ninety-six putative ap2/erf genes were identified from the manihot esculenta genome  that were predicted to include one or two complete ap2/erf domains . the gene set represents approximately   <dig>  % of the annotated genes in the cassava genome , which is very similar to the proportion of arabidopsis genes , and greater than the proportion of poplar , foxtail millet  and rice  genes  <cit> . based on the similarity of the amino acid sequences with the arabidopsis thaliana ap2/erf protein family, twenty-nine genes were identified as encoding proteins containing two ap2-domains and thus assigned to the ap <dig> family. seven genes were predicted to encode one ap2-domain and one b3-domain and were thus assigned to the rav family. one hundred and fifty-five genes were found to encode proteins containing a single ap2/erf domain, and the genes could be further classified into two groups based on the similarity of their amino acid sequences: one hundred genes were found to potentially encode erf subfamily members, whereas fifty five genes were predicted to encode dreb subfamily members. two genes were assigned to the soloist family based on their similarity to the arabidopsis soloist   <cit> . three genes were also found to contain one single ap <dig> domain; however, their homologies were quite low compared with the other ap2/erf factors and were therefore assigned to the others subfamily .table  <dig> comparison the ap2/erf family of m.esculenta with a.thaliana

phylogenetic reconstruction of the cassava ap2/erf superfamily
to study the phylogenetic relationships among the cassava ap2/erf super-family members, a phylogenetic tree were generated using  <dig> ap2/erf amino acid sequences. the resulting phylogenetic tree contained  <dig> groups, termed ap <dig>  rav, dreb, erf, soloist and others. members of the dreb group were classified into six subgroups: a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a6; similarly, the erf genes were also classified into  <dig> subgroups: b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> .fig.  <dig> an unrooted phylogenetic tree of  <dig> cassava ap2/erf transcription factors. cassava ap2/erf protein sequences were aligned using clustalw, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with mega  <dig>  using the neighbour-joining method, based on the p-distance model with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. each subfamily is represented by a specific colour



microarray identification of ap2/erf genes that are expressed in cassava leaf pulvinus-petiole azs during both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission
to compare the gene expression profiles during ethylene and water-deficit stress-induced cassava leaf abscission, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence  values  <cit>  of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were represented as six time points . to verify the reliability and accuracy of differential gene expression profiling, azs samples were collected with the same fv/fm values for both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission. then used time course cassava whole genome microarray analysis to examine the az gene expression during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission using the t <dig> time point as a control.

to analyse the az gene expression profiles during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, a cassava whole genome microarray  containing  <dig>  probe sets was constructed, representing the  <dig>  jgi database transcripts  and the  <dig> genbank transcripts. to identify differences in ap2/erf gene expression, statistical analysis was used to screen the microarray data for genes that were differentially expressed in the treatment samples  compared with the t <dig> control. a stringent false discovery rate  and log2t2-t6/t <dig>  values as thresholds were used to estimate the differences in gene expression during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission using three replicates. sota clustering performed to analyze the differences in gene expression profiles among the six leaf abscission time points, finding that fdr-corrected p values of < <dig>  and significant changes in expression occurred at least one time point for each ap2/erf gene expressed during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission.

during ethylene-induced leaf abscission,  <dig> ap2/erf genes were differentially expressed, whereas  <dig> ap2/erf genes were differentially expressed during water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission . ninety-nine ap2/erf genes were differentially expressed during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, whereas  <dig> were differentially expressed only during ethylene-induced leaf abscission, and  <dig> were differentially expressed during water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission . of the ap2/erf genes induced by water-deficit stress treatment, six sota clusters  could be separated into four groups of primary expression patterns . the first group, clusters wds <dig> and wds <dig>  was down-regulated throughout the experimental period compared with the control. the second group, cluster wds <dig>  was up-regulated at the early and middle experimental time points, t <dig> and t3; whereas the third group, clusters wds <dig> and wds <dig>  was up-regulated at the later experimental time points t <dig>  t <dig> and t6; and the fourth group, cluster wds <dig>  was up-regulated at the latest experimental time points, t <dig> and t <dig> fig.  <dig> ap2/erf genes shared between and unique to ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission. wd: water-deficit stress; et: ethylene

the six ethylene-induced ap2/erf gene sota clusters  were separated into five main expression patterns . the first group, clusters ets <dig> and ets <dig>  was down-regulated throughout the experimental period compared with the control. the second group, cluster ets <dig>  was up-regulated early, at t2; the third group, cluster ets <dig>  was up-regulated at t <dig> during the middle of the experimental period; and the fourth group, cluster ets <dig>  was up-regulated at the later experimental points t <dig> and t <dig>  the fifth group, cluster ets <dig>  was up-regulated throughout the experimental period but also exhibited the highest expression levels at t <dig> and t <dig> compared with the control.

comparison of ap2/erf expression profiles between ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission indicated that erf subfamily genes are widely expressed in the cassava abscission zone
to identify the ap2/erf genes that participate in both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, the ap2/erf expression profiles were compared in both treatments using sota clustering. because the expression patterns of ap2/erf genes were nearly identical between ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, the similar expression patterns at each time point were compared in both ethylene and water-deficit stress treatment.

the ap2/erf genes that were up-regulated during the early experimental period  in response to both treatments  were first examined. during ethylene treatment-induced leaf abscission, nineteen ets <dig> cluster ap2/erf genes exhibited increased expression during the early stages of leaf abscission, and go annotation indicated that  <dig> of the genes participate in ethylene-mediated signalling  . during water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, seven wds <dig> cluster ap2/erf genes exhibited increased expression during the early stages of leaf abscission, and go annotation indicated that five of the genes participate in ethylene-mediated signalling . two genes, cassava <dig> _025181m and cassava <dig> _026705m, were expressed during the early stages of leaf abscission in response to both ethylene and water-deficit stress, and both participate in ethylene-mediated signalling . cassava <dig> _025181m encodes crf <dig>  a member of the ethylene response factor  b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _026705m encodes dreb <dig>  a member of the dreb a- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively.table  <dig> gene count, p-value and q-value for ap2/erf genes participated in ethylene-mediated signalling  among six clusters in both ethylene and water-deficit stress treatment



at the middle stage of leaf abscission , the ets <dig> and wds <dig> groups  exhibited similar expression patterns . twenty-two ap2/erf genes exhibited increased expression in response to ethylene treatment, and go annotation indicated that ten participate in ethylene-mediated signalling . at the t <dig> time point during water-deficit stress, seven ap2/erf genes exhibited increased expression. two genes, cassava <dig> _015499m and cassava <dig> _028940m, were expressed during both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission . cassava <dig> _015499m encodes erf <dig>  a member of the b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _028940m encodes erf <dig>  a member of the b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively.

later in leaf abscission , ets <dig> and wds <dig>  exhibited similar expression patterns . in response to ethylene treatment, nineteen ap2/erf genes exhibited increased expression, and go annotation indicated that fourteen participate in ethylene-mediated signalling . in response to water-deficit treatment, eight ap2/erf genes exhibited increased expression, and go annotation indicated that six participate in ethylene-mediated signalling . comparative analysis indicated that three genes, cassava <dig> _023899m, cassava <dig> _027342m and cassava <dig> _030658m, were expressed during both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission. cassava <dig> _023899m encodes crf <dig>  a member of the b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively; cassava <dig> _027342m encodes ebe, a member of the b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively; and cassava <dig> _030658m encodes ese <dig>  a member b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively.

the ets <dig>  wds <dig> and wds <dig> groups of genes were up-regulated throughout the experimental period . thirty-one ap2/erf genes exhibited this expression pattern in response to ethylene treatment, and go annotation indicated that  <dig> participate in ethylene-mediated signalling . fifty ap2/erf genes were up-regulated throughout the experimental period in response to water-deficit treatment, and go annotation indicated that  <dig> participate in ethylene mediated-signalling . seventeen genes, cassava <dig> _010068m, cassava <dig> _010102m, cassava <dig> _010512m, cassava <dig> _014721m, cassava <dig> _022726m, cassava <dig> _023527m, cassava <dig> _023697m, cassava <dig> _007311m, cassava <dig> _007457m, cassava <dig> _013880m, cassava <dig> _014267m, cassava <dig> _014632m, cassava <dig> _014695m, cassava <dig> _015856m, cassava <dig> _017103m, cassava <dig> _022781m and cassava <dig> _032424m were expressed during both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission. cassava <dig> _010068m encodes edf <dig>  a rav transcription factor family member that contains ap <dig> and b <dig> binding domains, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _010102m encodes rap <dig> , a dreb a- <dig> subfamily member of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _010512m encodes crf <dig>  a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _014721m encodes erf <dig>  a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _022726m encodes crf <dig>  a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _023527m encodes rap <dig> , a member of the dreb a- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _023697m encodes erf <dig>  a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _007311m and cassava <dig> _007457m encode a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, cassava <dig> _007311m has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively; cassava <dig> _007457m has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _013880m and cassava <dig> _014267m both encode rap <dig> , a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of plant-specific erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, cassava <dig> _013880m has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively; cassava <dig> _014267m has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _014632m encodes rap <dig>  l, a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _014695m encodes crf <dig>  a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _015856m, cassava <dig> _017103m and cassava <dig> _022781m encode erf <dig>  a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, cassava <dig> _015856m has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively; cassava <dig> _017103m has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively; cassava <dig> _022781m has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively. cassava <dig> _032424m encodes erf <dig>  a member of the erf b- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> transcription factors, it has the expression ratio  of  <dig>  in response to ethylene and  <dig>  to water-deficit stress respectively.

promoter motif prediction for erf subfamily genes expressed during both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission
as described above, twenty-four genes were expressed in response to both ethylene and water-deficit stress, and twenty belonged to the erf subfamily . to further understand the potential functions of the genes in regulating abscission zone development, the promoters of the twenty erf subfamily genes were analysed to identify cis-elements. for this analysis,  <dig> kbp sequences of putative promoter regions were examined for potential cis-regulatory elements that are responsive to water-deficit stress and ethylene  <cit> . three drought stress response cis-elements, s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  as well as two ethylene response cis-elements, s <dig> and s <dig>  were frequently identified within the promoter regions of the genes . many erf genes contained more than twenty drought stress elements and more than five ethylene response elements, e.g. cassava <dig> _025181m, cassava <dig> _014721m, cassava <dig> _022726m, cassava <dig> _023697m, cassava <dig> _007311m, cassava <dig> _013880m, cassava <dig> _014267m, cassava <dig> _015856m, cassava <dig> _017103m and cassava <dig> _022781m .table  <dig> twenty erf subfamily genes are widely expressed in the cassava abscission zone in both water-deficit stress and ethylene treatment

acc oxidase was up-regulated during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission
go annotation and promoter motif prediction of the twenty erf subfamily genes expressed during ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments indicated functions in the ethylene response, suggesting that ethylene is an important factor in both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission. measurements of acc oxidase concentration  indicated that acc oxidase activity gradually increased from t <dig> to t <dig>  furthermore, acc oxidase activity levels were reduced during the early and middle stages of water-deficit stress-induced abscission compared with ethylene treatment. in contrast, acc oxidase activities later increased sharply during water-deficit stress-induced abscission compared with ethylene treatment . together, the results indicate that ethylene was more concentrated in azs during water-deficit stress than during ethylene treatment.fig.  <dig> aco measurements at six time points during ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments. wd: water-deficit stress; et: ethylene



validation of comparative gene expression profiles of twenty erf subfamily genes in two cassava cultivars with differing levels of leaf abscission
to further understand the regulatory function of erf subfamily genes in leaf abscission, their expression levels were examined in two cassava cultivars, ‘ku50’ and ‘sc5’. compared to ‘sc5’ and other cultivars, ‘ku50’ is more easily drop off the leaves when met the same stress condition  <cit> . the expression ratios of the twenty erf genes were compared between the cultivars at six time points during water-deficit stress, and clustered the erf gene expression patterns using hierarchical clustering. the analysis indicated that most of the erf genes  were more highly expressed at the middle and later time points  in the ‘ku50’ cultivar than in ‘sc5’. in particular, six erf genes, cassava <dig> _ <dig>  cassava <dig> _ <dig>  cassava <dig> _ <dig>  cassava <dig> _ <dig>  cassava <dig> _ <dig> and cassava <dig> _ <dig> exhibited increased expression in ‘ku50’ compared with ‘sc5’ during the middle stages . at this stage, ‘ku50’ is more susceptible to dropping leaves than ‘sc5’ under the same conditions of water-deficit stress as all ‘ku50’ leaves, but few ‘sc5’ leaves, wither . together, the data indicate that the middle stage is the key stage for determining leaf abscission.fig.  <dig> identification of  <dig> erf subfamily genes in two cassava cultivars  under water-deficit stress. a heat map of real-time quantitative pcr  results for  <dig> erf subfamily genes in two water-deficit stressed cassava cultivars; three biological and technical replicates were performed. b the water-deficit stress phenotype of two cassava cultivars, ‘ku50’ and ‘sc5’, at the middle stage of leaf abscission. real-time pcr primer sequences are listed in additional file 7: table s <dig>  the expression ratios for each erf gene at each time point are presented first using t <dig> as a control for both ‘ku50’ and ‘sc5’, and then to cut ‘ku50’ expression ratios with those of ‘sc5’ at each time point. the heat map depicts the log2-transformed fold change values. the log <dig>  and the colour scale are indicated above the heat map



discussion
comparative analysis of cassava and arabidopsis ap2/erf genes indicated a greater number of erf subfamily members in the cassava genome than in the arabidopsis genome
the ap2/erf family is one of the most important subfamilies involved in plant development as well as abiotic and biotic stress response  <cit> . this study is the first to identify and characterize the ap2/erf family in cassava. here, one hundred and ninety-six cassava ap2/erf genes were classified into  <dig> subfamilies . previously, sakuma et al.  reported the existence of  <dig> arabidopsis ap2/erf genes  <cit> . we compared the cassava and arabidopsis families and groups using the available complete genome sequences, finding more erf and ap <dig> subfamily members within the cassava genome. notably, the number of cassava erf subfamily members  far exceeds that of the arabidopsis genome  . the number of dreb subfamily members is similar between the two genomes; however, the dreb subfamily sizes differ. four arabidopsis erf groups, b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b6; and two dreb groups, a <dig> and a <dig>  contained more members . the number of cassava erf subfamily members far outnumbers that in arabidopsis, suggesting that this subfamily experienced a gene duplication event during cassava evolution. gene duplication is considered to be the primary driving force of new gene functions  <cit> . in the study, more erf genes were observed to participate in ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced abscission, suggesting that the erf subfamily plays more important functions in cassava plant development than in other subfamilies.

erf subfamily genes expressed at various time points function to regulate the progression of cassava leaf abscission
ap2/erf genes have been shown to play crucial roles in various developmental processes, such as response to various stresses  <cit> , phytohormone signalling  <cit>  and defence  <cit> . here, molecular methods were used attemptly to identify the key ap2/erf genes that regulate cassava leaf abscission in response to ethylene and water-deficit stress. to maintain consistency between the two leaf abscission induction experiments, six fv/fm values were selected to serve as time points during leaf abscission for az sample collection prior to microarray analysis. to identify the ap2/erf genes expressed during cassava leaf abscission in response to both treatments, the ap2/erf gene expression profiles of pulvinus-petiole azs were used for sota clustering. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> ap2/erf genes were detectably expressed during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission, respectively . among the ap2/erf genes,  <dig> were expressed during both ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission , suggesting that similar genes regulate leaf abscission in response to the stresses. comparative analysis of ap2/erf gene expression profiles during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced leaf abscission resulted in the selection of  <dig> ap2/erf genes distributed among the different time points, including  <dig> erf subfamily genes,  <dig> derb subfamily genes, and one rav subfamily gene , suggesting that erf subfamily genes play important roles in cassava abscission zone development. during early leaf abscission, high levels of crf <dig> expression were detected  that mediate the cytokinin response  <cit> , indicating that cassava plant maintained growth and development during the early stages of ethylene and water-deficit stress treatment. abscission does not occur during the early stages. crf <dig> expression decreased during the middle and late stages of abscission, suggesting that abscission occurs within azs at the stages. the reduced expression this gene type in response to cytokinin may indicate the start of abscission.

during the middle of abscission, erf <dig> expression was high . erf <dig> was shown to direct leaf senescence progression, and transgenic arabidopsis plants with increased aterf <dig> expression exhibited precocious leaf senescence  <cit> . gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggested that this gene is involved in regulating the expression of many genes that are involved in leaf senescence progression  <cit> . high erf <dig> expression during the middle stages of cassava abscission suggested that senescence occurred in az cells at this stage and that az cells underwent precocious senescence in response to external stresses that induced erf <dig> expression  <cit> .

later in abscission, high ese <dig> expression levels were detected . ese <dig> has been suggested to regulate stamen abscission zone development by communicating with components of the hae pathway within the ethylene-dependent pathway  <cit> . from this point, both ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments regulate leaf abscission via the ethylene-dependent pathway. the acc oxidase activity measurements also confirmed that the ethylene contents of azs increased during ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced abscission, although their ethylene contents increased sharply during water-deficit stress treatment . the data suggest that ethylene is a primary factor that contributes to ethylene- and water-deficit stress-induced cassava leaf abscission.

seventeen ap2/erf genes were highly expressed between t <dig> and t <dig> in response to both ethylene and water-deficit stress treatment . the genes that exhibited the expression pattern primarily contributed to cassava leaf abscission. high levels of edf <dig> expression at this stage have been reported to promote flower senescence and abscission, as well as activate senescence-associated genes downstream in the ethylene response  <cit> . rap <dig> a was also highly expressed at this stage; this gene is predicted to act in reactive oxygen species  signalling by controlling nuclear expression of 2-cys peroxiredoxin a and other chloroplast antioxidant enzymes. in the previous study, ros were proved to play an important role in the regulation of cassava leaf abscission  <cit> ; furthermore, ros are related to ethylene and water-deficit stress  <cit> . high expression levels of another erf <dig> gene were also detected at this stage. rap <dig>  has been implicated in the abiotic stress response, acting to regulate multiple aquaporin genes that were also highly expressed in response to ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments, suggested that water homeostasis is disrupted during cassava leaf abscission  <cit> . two rap <dig>  genes, cassava <dig> _013880m and cassava <dig> _014267m, were also highly expressed at this stage and have been shown to participate in the responses to low oxygen, oxidative and osmotic stress  <cit> . go annotation also suggested this gene functions to regulate cell death , and comparison of their expression ratios between ‘ku50’ and ‘sc5’ confirmed increased expression in the ‘ku50’ cassava cultivar that exhibited precocious abscission when met the same stress . rap <dig>  l has been reported to induce premature senescence by increasing stomatal closure more than the high antioxidant enzyme activity levels that are also detected at that stage. the gene has also been reported to participate in the jasmonic, salicylic, and abscisic acid pathways as well as the ethylene pathway, indicated that many phytohormone pathways are involved in cassava leaf abscission  <cit> . furthermore, increased expression levels were also observed in the precocious abscission ‘ku50’ cultivar compared with ‘sc5’ cultivar subjected to the same stress . two erf <dig> genes, cassava <dig> _ <dig> and cassava <dig> _017103m, are highly expressed at that stage, and this gene has been shown to have early and transient oxidative activity during plant responses to osmotic, ionic, redox and hormonal signalling  <cit> . comparison of the ‘ku50’ and ‘sc5’ erf <dig> expression ratios further confirmed increased expression in the precocious abscission ‘ku50’ cultivar when subjected to the same stress . together, the data suggest that many signalling pathways are involved in cassava leaf abscission, e.g. hormonal, ros, water stress, programmed cell death , and osmotic signalling.

since six erf genes, cassava <dig> _ <dig> , cassava <dig> _ <dig> , cassava <dig> _ <dig> , cassava <dig> _ <dig> , cassava <dig> _ <dig>  and cassava <dig> _ <dig> , expressed at higher levels in the precocious abscission ‘ku50’ cultivar than in the delayed abscission ‘sc5’ cultivar, suggested the six erf genes play important regulation roles on abscission when suffered form stress. the analyses of the putative downstream genes of the six genes were examined. glutathione s-transferase  <dig>  can be regulated by rap <dig> , glutathione s-transferase  proved to play major roles in oxidative stress metabolism, the levels of gst, can be induced by diverse environmental stimuli, were necessary to maintain cell redox homeostasis and protect plants against oxidative stress  <cit> . overexpression rap <dig>  in arabidopsis have been proved to cause up-regulation of gst <dig>  suggested gst <dig> act downstream of the rap <dig>   <cit> . pdf <dig> , a plant defensin gene, related to ros detoxification, was increased in arabidopsis lines overexpressing rap <dig>  and erf <dig>  <cit> . actually, pdf <dig>  is a typical downstream gene of the ethylene/jasmonic acid signaling, thus, it is likely that erf promotes transcription of pdf <dig>  through in vivo binding to the gcc-box  <cit> .

weak ethylene insensitive2/anthranilate synthase α <dig> , encoding a rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan  biosynthesis, asa <dig> has proved to act downstream of erf <dig>  <cit> . erf <dig> can bind to asa <dig> promoter and directly up-regulate asa <dig> expression  <cit> . which also has been examined to have the function of leading to auxin accumulation and ethylene-induced inhibition of plant growth  <cit> , indicated asa <dig> regulate the abscission zone separation by regulate the homeostasis of auxin and ethylene. in addition, arabidopsis nudix hydrolase  <dig>  also proved to act downstream of erf <dig> because erf <dig> protein has been examined to bind to the gcc-box motif in the atnudt <dig> promoter  <cit> . atnudt <dig> plays an important role in regulating redox homeostasis during stress/defense signaling  <cit> . the early responsiveness of atnudt <dig> provides a useful marker especially during oxidative cell death in plants  <cit> , indicated atnudt <dig> may participate in regulating abscission zone development by oxidative cell death pathway.

many antioxidant enzymes, including apx <dig>  and fsd <dig> , and the water logging responsive gene adh <dig> , were proved to participate ros regulation  <cit> . all these encoded genes of these antioxidant enzymes acted downstream of rap <dig>  l, rap <dig>  l overexpression caused significant increases in the transcripts of these antioxidant enzymes  <cit> , suggesting these antioxidant enzymes participate to regulate abscission zone development by modify the antioxidant system of plants.

the expression profiles of other known genes involved in cassava abscission zone development
two most important breakthroughs were made in the abscission research, one of the most important breakthrough in abscission research was the identification of inflorescence deficient in abscission  to regulate cell separation processes in a. thaliana  <cit> . the ida mutant proved to fail to undergo floral organ abscission, while overexpression of ida lead to premature and ectopic abscission  <cit> . ida mediates its effect through the two leucine-rich repeat rlks  haesa  and haesa-like  <dig> , as the double knockout hae hsl <dig> is phenotypically similar to the ida mutant and overexpression of ida is not able to rescue this phenotype . another breakthrough in abscission research was the identification of the jointless  mutant locus in tomato  <cit> , which causes the plant to fail to develop pedicel azs. the j locus was isolated by map-based cloning and the wild-type gene encodes a mads-box transcription factor  <cit> . in tomato, three mads-box genes, including jointless, macrocaylyx, and slmbp <dig>  have been shown to be implicated in development of the flower abscission zone  <cit> , svp family mads-box proteins have also been confirmed the function on abscission regulation, moreover, svp family mads-box proteins have been proved to have the same function as jointless in abscission regulation, and discovered to interacted with macrocaylyx, and slmbp <dig>  indicating the key regulation role on abscission development  <cit> .

in the cassava abscission zone, ida expressed both in ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments, the expression patterns in both treatments were confirmed by qpcr in cassava abscission zones, the ida expression levels had very low at the early stages of abscission in both ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments, however, the expression levels of ida increased sharply at the later stages of abscission in both ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments, the highest expression ratios increased  <dig>  in ethylene treatment and  <dig>  in water-deficit stress treatment at t <dig> time point when compared to t <dig> time point respectively .fig.  <dig> identification of expression patterns of ida gene under water-deficit stress and ethylene treatment by real-time quantitative pcr. wd: water-deficit stress; et: ethylene



five mads-box proteins have been confirmed to express in abscission in both ethylene and water-deficit stress treatments . four mads-box genes, mads <dig>  mads <dig>  mads <dig> and mads <dig> detected with high expression levels in ethylene treatment, the highest expression ratio of mads <dig> and mads <dig> appeared at t <dig> time point and had  <dig>  and  <dig>  times when compared with t <dig> time point ; the highest expression ratio of mads <dig> and mads <dig> appeared at t <dig> time point with  <dig>  and  <dig>  times when compared with t <dig> time point. one mads-box gene, mads <dig> detected with high expression levels in water-deficit stress treatment, the expression ratio of mads <dig> had  <dig>  times in t <dig> time point when compared with t <dig> time point .fig.  <dig> identification of expression patterns of mads-box genes under water-deficit stress and ethylene treatment by real-time quantitative pcr. wd: water-deficit stress; et: ethylene



CONCLUSIONS
more erf subfamilies were found in the cassava genome than in the arabidopsis genome. comparative analysis of transcriptome expression profiles in response to ethylene and water-deficit stress indicated that most ap2/erf genes were expressed in response to both treatments, suggested that the same ap2/erf genes may function in leaf abscission in response to different treatments. comparisons of ap2/erf genes that were expressed at the same time points during abscission in response to both treatments indicated that  <dig> erf subfamily genes were highly expressed during leaf abscission. further analysis of promoter cis-elements and acc oxidase activities confirmed that the erf subfamily responds to ethylene and regulates cassava abscission zone development. the detection of high expression levels for most erf subfamily genes in precocious abscission cassava cultivar verified the regulatory function of erf subfamily genes in cassava abscission zone development.
