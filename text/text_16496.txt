BACKGROUND
parathyroid hormone  regulates calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. changes in extracellular ca2+  are sensed by the parathyroid g-protein coupled calcium receptor   <cit> . the car determines the response of the parathyroid to o at the levels of pth secretion, pth gene expression and parathyroid cell proliferation  <cit> . increased o activates the car, resulting in a g-protein-dependent activation of plc, pla <dig> and pld  <cit> . this results in decreased pth secretion and parathyroid cell proliferation. calcimimetics bind transmembrane   <dig> and tm <dig> of the car to allosterically alter the conformation of the car  <cit> . the calcimimetic r <dig> decreases pth secretion, pth mrna levels and parathyroid cell proliferation  <cit> . genetic deletion of gq/ <dig> specifically in the parathyroid leads to severe hyperparathyroidism   <cit> . similarly, car-/- mice are not viable due to the severe hpt  <cit>  and can be rescued by mating with pth-/- or gcm2-/- mice, where pth is either absent or markedly reduced  <cit> . therefore, the car and its signal transduction are central to parathyroid physiology and the maintenance of a normal serum pth and intact ca2+ homeostasis.

low serum ca2+ and chronic kidney disease lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism which is characterized by increased pth mrna levels in experimental models  <cit> . the increased pth mrna in vivo is post-transcriptional and is mediated by the interaction of trans-acting proteins to a defined cis-acting au-rich element  in the pth mrna 3'-untranslated region   <cit> . a 26-nucleotide sequence within the are is conserved among species and is both necessary and sufficient for protein binding and the regulation of pth mrna stability by dietary calcium or phosphorus depletion  <cit> . au-rich binding factor  <dig>  and upstream of n-ras  are pth mrna trans-acting proteins that stabilize pth mrna  <cit> . the binding of these proteins to the pth mrna 3'-utr is regulated in the parathyroid by chronic hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and experimental kidney failure as well as by the calcimimetic r <dig>  <cit> . we have recently identified the decay-promoting protein ksrp  as an additional pth mrna 3'-utr binding protein that determines pth mrna stability in transfected cells  <cit> . ksrp-pth mrna interaction is increased in parathyroids from hypophosphatemic rats, where pth mrna is unstable, and decreased in parathyroids from hypocalcemic and experimental renal failure rats, where the pth mrna is more stable. the balanced interaction of pth mrna with auf <dig> and ksrp determines pth mrna half-life and levels and hence serum pth levels  <cit> .

there is no parathyroid cell line and the signal transduction pathway whereby o regulates pth secretion has been characterized by using bovine parathyroid cells in suspension and rat parathyroid organ cultures  <cit> . parathyroid hormone gene expression and its regulation in cells in vitro have been studied in primary cultures of bovine parathyroids  <cit> . hek <dig> cells transfected with the car faithfully maintain an intact signal transduction after the stimulus of a high o to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway  <cit> . we have now utilized this transfected heterologous cell system to study the mechanisms whereby the car regulates pth gene expression. as the regulation of pth gene expression by o is predominantly post-transcriptional, we studied pth mrna stability in a system that was independent of any effect on pth transcription through the pth promoter. to do this we expressed pth mrna driven by a viral promoter to express large amounts of pth mrna in hek <dig> cells. differences in pth mrna levels would therefore represent only post-transcriptional regulation. expression of the car markedly decreased pth mrna levels and stability and conferred responsiveness to o and the calcimimetic r <dig> in these cells. this was mediated by the pth mrna 3'-utr are. moreover, expression of the car in the hek <dig> cells led to a shift from the interaction of the pth mrna with the stabilizing protein, auf <dig>  to the destabilizing protein, ksrp. furthermore, the expression of car modified auf <dig> post-translationally as previously shown in vivo  <cit> . therefore, the expression of the car in this heterologous cell system reproduces the signal transduction that determines pth gene expression in the parathyroid.

RESULTS
the calcium receptor decreases parathyroid hormone mrna levels post-transcriptionally in hek <dig> cells
pth gene expression is regulated post-transcriptionally by ca2+ and calcimimetics affecting pth mrna stability  <cit> . to focus on the effect of the car on pth mrna stability in a cell system we constructed an expression vector containing the full-length human pth gene including its three exons and two introns  driven by a viral sv <dig>  or cmv promoter . expression of pth from both viral promoters gave similar results and we used the cmv promoter for further studies.

the hpth expression plasmid was transiently transfected into hek <dig> cells. the transcribed pth mrna was correctly spliced resulting in pth mrna of the expected size . the pth mrna was translated into mature human pth that was measured in the medium by radioimmunoassay . we then studied the effect of the car on pth mrna levels in hek <dig> cells expressing the pth gene by transient transfection. the expression of the car was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on whole cells using an intact cell enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine cell surface expression  <cit>   and by western blot . transfection efficiency was >95%, as indicated by fluorescent microscopy of the cells co-transfected with a green fluorescent protein  expression plasmid . co-transfection of the human  car together with the hpth plasmid resulted in a marked decrease in pth mrna levels by northern blot  and real time rt pcr   corrected for co-transfected control genes gh  or endogenous hprt . the decrease in pth mrna by the car was reflected in a decrease in secreted pth at  <dig> h . transfection with another g protein coupled receptor , the pth receptor  had no effect on pth mrna levels, confirming the specificity of the car effect on pth mrna .

the calcium receptor decreases parathyroid hormone mrna levels through the parathyroid hormone mrna 3'-utr au-rich element
we have previously reported that the regulation of pth mrna levels is dependent upon a cis-acting instability are in the pth mrna 3'-utr  <cit> . we then determined if the regulation of pth mrna levels by the car is exerted through the pth mrna are, using a growth hormone  reporter gene containing either the rat pth  <dig> nt are  or a truncated non-functional pth mrna  <dig> nt element  <cit> . over-expression of the car decreased gh <dig> mrna levels but had no effect on wild-type gh mrna levels or on a gh mrna with the truncated  <dig> nt pth mrna are . our results indicate that the car specifically decreases pth mrna levels through the pth mrna are.

to study the effect of the car on pth mrna stability we used an in vitro degradation assay   <cit> . a radiolabeled polyadenylated in vitro-transcribed hpth mrna was incubated with extracts from cells transfected with either the car expression plasmid or a control plasmid. the amount of intact pth mrna remaining with time represents the decay of the transcript by the different extracts and is indicative of the decay rate in vivo  <cit> . the rate of pth mrna decay was increased by extracts from cells expressing the car compared with extracts from cells with control plasmid correlating with pth mrna levels in the transfected cells . we then performed ivda using polyadenylated pth mrna with an internal deletion of the are . the pth mrna transcript lacking the are was stable throughout the experiment and in contrast to the full-length pth mrna, was not affected by expression of the car . our results indicate that the car specifically decreases steady-state pth mrna levels and pth mrna stability through the pth mrna are.

protein-pth mrna interactions by rna immunoprecipitation assays
in vivo in the rat parathyroid, pth mrna stability is determined by the regulated binding of auf <dig> and ksrp to the pth mrna 3'-utr  <cit> . to identify protein-mrna interactions in the car transfected cells, we performed rna immunoprecipitation  assays using extracts from hek <dig> cells transfected with the car or control plasmids. immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies to auf <dig>  ksrp or control igg followed by qrt pcr of the recovered rna and input extracts. parathyroid hormone mrna was decreased in the car expressing extracts compared with control extracts  as above . the rip assay showed that the amount of pth mrna bound to auf <dig> was decreased in car-expressing cells compared with control cells . in contrast, pth mrna bound to ksrp was increased in the car-expressing cells . this binding pattern is consistent with the stabilizing function of auf <dig> and the destabilizing function of ksrp on pth mrna  <cit> . the increased binding to ksrp and the decreased binding to auf <dig> correlate with the lower levels of pth mrna induced by the car in the transfected cells.

the calcium receptor leads to post-translational modification of the parathyroid hormone mrna binding protein auf1
in vivo dietary-induced hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia as well as adenine-induced renal failure and the calcimimetic r <dig> lead to post-translational modifications of auf <dig> as shown by 2d gels  <cit> . to determine whether the effect of the car on pth mrna stability in the engineered cells involves post-translational modifications of auf <dig> as it does in the parathyroid, we performed 2d gels on extracts from hek <dig> cells transfected with the car expression plasmid or an empty vector as control. auf <dig> has four isoforms of p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  there was no difference in auf <dig> protein levels in the 1d gels between cells with and without the car, apart from a small decrease in p <dig> in the car-expressing cells . however, 2d gels showed that endogenous auf <dig> isoforms p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> had a different distribution of the spots between extracts of cells with and without the car . these results suggest that the car induces post-translational modifications in auf <dig> in the transfected cells.

to analyze the four isoforms of auf <dig> separately, we utilized myc-tagged auf <dig> expression plasmids. hek <dig> cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for myc- p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or p <dig> isoforms of auf <dig> together with the car or control plasmids. cell extracts were analyzed on 2d gels with an anti-myc antibody. car expression led to changes in mobility of myc-auf <dig> p <dig>  p <dig> and also p <dig> but not p <dig> . unlike the changes in myc-auf <dig> p <dig>  endogenous auf <dig> p <dig> was only slightly modified by car signaling. the change in endogenous p <dig> was not reflected in the myc-tagged transfected p <dig>  the reasons for these discrepancies are not clear. auf <dig> p <dig> undergoes reversible phosphorylation which may regulate are-directed mrna turnover  <cit> . we therefore added a non-specific phosphatase to extracts from cells expressing myc-p <dig> with or without the car. calf intestinal phosphatase  treatment of control extracts modified auf <dig> to the form present in car-expressing extracts . treatment with cip had no further effect on the car-expressing extracts. these results indicate that the car modifies auf <dig> post-translationally and suggests that at least part of this change involves phosphorylation of isoform p <dig> 

parathyroid hormone mrna levels are regulated by o and the calcimimetic r <dig> through the calcium receptor
we then studied the effect of a low-calcium medium on the regulation of pth gene expression by the car in the transfected cells. hek <dig> cells transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for pth and the car or a control plasmid were grown in a medium with either  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm ca2+. expression of the car decreased pth mrna in cells grown in physiological  <dig>  mm ca2+ concentration by both northern blots and qrt pcr  as in figure  <dig>  importantly, the low-ca2+ medium attenuated the decrease in pth mrna levels induced by the car . there was no effect of a low-ca2+ medium in cells that did not express the car.

calcimimetics are compounds that bind and activate the car  <cit> . we then performed the same experiments with and without the calcimimetic, r <dig> . the car decreased pth mrna levels as before at  <dig>  mm ca2+ . activation of the car by r <dig> decreased pth mrna levels at  <dig>  mm ca2+  and also at  <dig>  mm ca2+ .  <dig>  mm ca2+ prevented the decrease in pth mrna levels due to the car . however, at  <dig>  mm ca2+ the addition of r <dig> still effectively decreased pth mrna levels . there was no effect of car expression on co-transfected gfp mrna levels  used as a control for transfection efficiency and loading. there was also no effect of r <dig> on pth mrna levels in cells co-transfected with the control plasmid that did not express the car . the effect of r <dig> on pth mrna levels in the car-transfected cells at  <dig>  mm ca2+ indicates that the calcimimetic is effective at activating the car even when the car is in a relaxed configuration. therefore, in these engineered cells, the car is permissive for the effect of o and r <dig> on pth mrna levels.

discussion
primary bovine parathyroid cells in culture have been successfully used for the study of pth secretion in the short term  but not for longer term effects on pth gene expression. this is because these primary monolayer cultures of parathyroid cells lose the expression of the car after  <dig> h in culture  <cit> . parathyroid organoid cultures retain a prolonged calcium response and regulation of pth mrna stability by high o and a calcimimetic  <cit> . however, there is no parathyroid cell line. kifor et al  <cit>  showed that the car activated the phosphotyrosine kinase in both car-transfected hek <dig> cells and native bovine parathyroid cells. in car-expressing hek <dig> cells, o activates pi-plc, pla <dig> and pld, similar to the effect in bovine primary parathyroid cell cultures  <cit> . there have been no studies on the effect of the car on the regulation of pth gene expression using the transfected hek <dig> cells. we therefore expressed the car together with the hpth gene in hek <dig> cells. the effect of o and the calcimimetic r <dig> on pth expression in the parathyroid in vivo is predominantly post-transcriptional, regulating pth mrna stability and not transcription through the pth promoter  <cit> . this allowed us to use a viral promoter upstream of the hpth gene to study the effect of the car signaling on pth mrna levels. the pth gene was efficiently transcribed, processed and translated to mature immunoreactive pth. significantly, pth mrna and secreted pth levels were decreased in cells expressing the car compared with control cells. the calcium concentration in the medium was  <dig>  mm, which would activate the car to reduce pth mrna levels in the car-transfected cells. therefore, the car suppresses pth gene expression post-transcriptionally by acting on pth mrna driven by a viral and not the native pth promoter. in vitro degradation assays using extracts from cells with or without the car showed that expression of the car led to a decrease in full-length pth mrna half-life but not the half-life of a pth mrna with an internal deletion of the pth mrna are. the decreased pth mrna stability correlated with decreased pth mrna steady state levels.

dietary-induced changes in serum calcium and phosphate levels regulate pth gene expression in vivo post-transcriptionally  <cit> . this regulation is mediated by the changes in binding of stabilizing trans-acting factors, auf <dig> and unr, and the destabilizing protein ksrp, to the defined cis-acting are in the pth mrna 3'-utr  <cit> . the role of the pth mrna are in the regulation of pth mrna levels by the car was demonstrated by transfection experiments using a gh reporter mrna containing the pth mrna  <dig> nt are. the car decreased gh-pth are mrna levels but had no effect on native gh mrna or a gh mrna containing a truncated pth mrna are. calcium receptor-transfected hek <dig> cells showed increased ksrp-pth mrna binding and decreased auf1-pth mrna binding by rip analysis, correlating with the decreased pth mrna levels and stability in the car-transfected cells. therefore, the signaling of the car in the parathyroid is maintained in the transfected cells as reflected in changes in auf <dig> and ksrp pth mrna interactions and the role of the pth mrna are in this regulation.

auf1-pth mrna binding is increased by hypocalcemia or chronic kidney disease, or decreased by hypophosphatemia or administration of the calcimimetic r <dig>  <cit> . these changes in serum ca2+ or phosphate and kidney disease are associated with post-translational modifications of auf <dig>  auf <dig> isoforms p <dig> and p <dig> are modified by dietary-induced hypocalcemia, and the secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic kidney disease and its treatment by r <dig>  <cit> . we now show that expression of the car in the engineered cells also induces post-translational modifications in both endogenous auf <dig> and myc-tagged transfected auf <dig> isoforms that are similar to the modifications in vivo in the parathyroid. the modification of at least auf <dig> p <dig> involves phosphorylation where expression of the car is associated with dephosphorylation. post-translational modifications of this isoform, auf <dig> p <dig>  are altered concomitant with changes in rna binding activity and stabilization of are-containing mrnas in phorbol ester-treated monocytic leukemia cells  <cit> . auf <dig> p <dig> recovered from polysomes was phosphorylated on ser <dig> and ser <dig> in untreated cells but lost these modifications following phorbol ester treatment. it was suggested that selected signal transduction pathways may regulate are-directed mrna turnover by reversible phosphorylation of auf <dig> p <dig>  <cit> . therefore, both in the car-transfected cells and in the phorbol ester-treated cells, dephosphorylation of auf <dig> p <dig>  is associated with decreased auf <dig> activity. in the case of pth mrna, inactivity of auf <dig> results in a less stable pth mrna after expression of the car, as auf <dig> is a pth mrna stabilizing protein  <cit> .

we also show that expression of the car conferred responsiveness to low o and the calcimimetic r <dig>  underlining the relevance of this cellular model to the parathyroid. a low- o medium increased pth expression only in the cells expressing the car. similarly, r <dig> decreased pth expression through the car at both  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm o. therefore, regulation of pth mrna levels by expression of the car itself and both its activation by the calcimimetic and its relaxation by a low o are maintained in these transfected cells. this is the first demonstration that the car can regulate pth gene expression in heterologous cells. this regulation is obtained through the post-transcriptional mechanisms that involve changes in pth mrna-protein interactions in the parathyroid . it is likely that pth secretion would exhibit a similar regulation by calcium as pth mrna levels, given its dependence on the latter. however, secretion was not measured as a function of the extracellular calcium concentration in the heterologous hek <dig> cell system, in which there is a prominent component of constitutive secretion, unlike the parathyroid cell  <cit> . secretion in hek <dig> cells may be independently regulated by the car although we have not studied this question. the parathyroid cell is unique in that the stimulus for secretion, gene expression and cell proliferation is a low o and not a high o. inverse control of secretion by a low o of pthrp secretion also occurs in the epithelial cells of the lactating breast and certain breast cell lines  <cit> . in addition high o decreases hormone secretion in the secretion of renin by renal juxtaglomerular cells  <cit> . calcium receptor activation increases cell proliferation in cultured cells  <cit> , but inhibits parathyroid proliferation in vivo  <cit> . it is remarkable and intriguing that despite these differences, the transfected cell system retains so many of the native characteristics of the unique parathyroid cell, specifically the relationship between calcium and pth mrna stability. the car-mediated decrease in pth expression in these cells mirrors the marked increase in serum pth in vivo in mice and men with inactivating mutations of the car  <cit> . these results support the concept that the parathyroid cell is geared to constitutively synthesize and secrete pth, and it is the presence of a functioning car that tonically inhibits pth expression and secretion and allows responsivity to o.

auf <dig> = au rich binding factor; ksrp = kh domain splicing regulatory protein; pth = parathyroid hormone

CONCLUSIONS
the expression of the car in transfected hek <dig> cells decreases pth gene expression post-transcriptionally and is sufficient to confer the regulation of pth gene expression by o and a calcimimetic, r <dig>  the car decreases pth gene expression in these engineered cells through the balanced interactions of the trans-acting factors ksrp and auf <dig> with pth mrna and the pth mrna are, as in vivo in the parathyroid. this is the first demonstration that the car can regulate pth gene expression in heterologous transiently transfected cells.
