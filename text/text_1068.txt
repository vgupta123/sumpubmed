BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is a gram-negative zoonotic bacterium that can colonise the gut of humans and many species of food producing farm animals and cause enteric or septicaemic salmonellosis 
 <cit> . in pigs, infections by s. typhimurium mostly lead to a localised enterocolitis, which is responsible for significant economic losses to the pig industry 
 <cit> . an unknown percentage of salmonella infected pigs continue to be asymptomatic carriers even after acute response, thereby posing long-term zoonotic threats through contaminating the pork production chain. prevention and control of salmonellosis in pigs thus assumes great importance not only for animal welfare, reduced antibiotic use and improved profitability of pig industry but also for minimizing risks to public health 
 <cit> .

host genetic response to salmonella infection has been well studied in several species. a review by roy and malo 
 <cit>  has reported several genes to be involved in regulation of responses to salmonella infection in mice, for example, slc11a <dig> , tlr <dig>  btk, lbp, cd <dig>  cybb, nos <dig>  tnf, il <dig>  ifng, il12b, tlr <dig> and others. clinical manifestations associated with salmonella infection are dependent on several factors such as the serotype of salmonella involved, host species affected and age of the host. while infection with s. typhimurium induces a systemic disease similar to human typhoid fever in mice, the infection is mostly of the enteric form in pigs, except in the case of very young piglets 
 <cit> . thus a different set of genes may contribute to resistance against salmonella infection depending on the host species and the salmonella serotype involved. indeed, studies of salmonella resistance in chicken report different genes depending on whether the infection is systemic or enteric 
 <cit> . for example, the slc11a <dig> gene and the sal <dig> locus confer resistance to systemic salmonellosis 
 <cit> , whereas several members of the gallinacin gene family confer resistance to enteric salmonellosis 
 <cit> .

studies on several species have shown that host genetic variations in natural populations contribute to varying responses to different pathogens in terms of resistance or increased susceptibility 
. distinct responses to salmonella infection have been observed in pigs, some recovering faster and shedding lower levels of salmonella in faeces than others  
 <cit> . this trait variation could indicate the existence of a genetic component to salmonella shedding and resistance that may be exploited in animal breeding and disease diagnostics. uthe et al. 
 <cit>  reported snps in ten genes, including gng <dig>  ncf <dig> and ccr <dig>  that were associated with salmonella shedding in pigs. while many studies have looked into the host genetic response to salmonella infection, relatively few have used trait-gene expression correlation to identify genes whose variable expression among uninfected individuals may be associated with differences in salmonella clearance and resistance. for example, several genes involved in innate immunity  have been shown to be either constitutively or inductively more highly expressed in caecal tonsils of salmonella resistant strains of chicken compared to susceptible strains 
 <cit> . a study on mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in humans identified a snp that appears to control susceptibility to tuberculosis through its effects on the expression of the dusp <dig> gene in dendritic cells prior to infection 
 <cit> . differences in gene expression prior to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  virus infection have been observed among pigs belonging to different phenotypic groups as defined by the viral load and weight gain of individual pigs observed during a defined number of days following infection 
 <cit> . such differences in gene expression among different phenotypic groups have been attributed to the differences in the genetic background of individual pigs 
 <cit> . taken together, the findings reported above may indicate that genetic resistance to infections is mediated in part through the presence of a more activated defense system in resistant individuals compared to susceptible individuals so that, in the event of an infection, resistant individuals can mount a faster and more effective immune response.

in this study we assess the whole blood transcriptome prior to and following infection. whole blood consists of cells that form integral parts of the immune system and whole blood can be easily and repeatedly sampled. the whole blood transcriptome provides a ‘snap shot’ of the complex immune networks that operate throughout the body 
 <cit>  and several studies in humans and animals have analysed the blood transcriptome to provide new insights into host immune responses against a wide variety of pathogens and to identify potential biomarkers 
 <cit> .

a recent microarray based study 
 <cit>  identified several hundreds of differentially expressed  genes including slc11a <dig> and tlr <dig> when comparing the whole blood transcriptome of pigs before  and two days after salmonella inoculation  and also reported significant differences in the number and expression profiles of de genes post inoculation in ls compared to ps. however, the de analysis performed in those studies failed to identify significant differences in expression of genes between ls and ps before salmonella challenge that could potentially explain or predict the varying responses between the two groups upon infection. this absence of de could be due to the fact that the differences in expression of host resistance genes against salmonella between ls and ps may be subtle, unlike the gene expression differences between non-infected and infected states, and thus requires a broader or more sensitive approach to identify those genes.

de analysis typically focuses on identifying genes with the most significant differences between contrasting conditions. in addition, the requirement for multiple testing corrections may further impede the discovery of genes with subtle differences in expression. a powerful alternative approach for gene expression analysis is co-expression analysis, which considers the relationships between measured transcripts in an unsupervised way. the weighted gene co-expression network analysis  approach 
 <cit> , one of the popular methods developed for gene co-expression analysis, effectively overcomes the multiple testing problems inherent in high throughput gene expression data analysis. this methodology begins with the identification of modules of highly correlated genes assessed by pair-wise correlations between gene expression profiles. next the relationships between only a few tens of modules and the phenotypic trait of interest are considered. finally candidate genes associated with the trait are prioritised based on network statistics like module membership and gene significance. wgcna has been used to identify genes and gene networks associated with specific tissues, distinct biological states or diseases, and qualitative as well as quantitative phenotypes 
.

here, we aimed to identify porcine genes and gene co-expression networks that differentiate distinct responses to salmonella challenge with respect to faecal salmonella shedding, using wgcna and rna-seq data from whole blood.

RESULTS
faecal salmonella shedding counts
the pigs used in this study were identified as ls or ps based on the cumulative area under the plotted log curve  of their faecal salmonella shedding counts  . for ls, the aulc ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   whereas for ps, it ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the lower the aulc, the lower the faecal shedding counts estimated for that pig. we predict that a lower early shedding count will accelerate the return of the animal to a healthy  status following salmonella challenge.table  <dig>

rna-seq profiling of porcine whole blood expressed genes and their functional classification
rna extracted from porcine peripheral blood samples collected at day  <dig> and day  <dig> post inoculation  of salmonella from  <dig> selected pigs identified as ls  and ps  were depleted for globin transcripts and subjected to illumina sequencing. the sequencing depths achieved for these samples ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> million reads , of which approximately 90%  mapped to the pig genome , identifying a total of  <dig>  expressed genes. the efficiency of the globin depletion protocol varied across samples with the total globin reads  ranging from  <dig> -60% of the total mapped reads post-depletion . based on data from a different set of samples  that were used to develop the globin depletion protocol 
 <cit>  , it is known that the total globin reads constitute  <dig> to 54%  of the total mapped reads in blood of pigs between 3– <dig> weeks of age. using this information on normal globin levels in pig blood, we estimate the globin depletion protocol to have worked well for  <dig> of the  <dig> samples used here where the total globin reads constituted below 15% of the total mapped reads. for  <dig> of the  <dig> samples, the protocol seemed to have worked to some extent, limiting total globin reads to between 20-30% of the total mapped reads. for the remaining  <dig> samples, however, the protocol either worked poorly  or did not work at all . the differing efficiencies of globin depletion would have affected our ability to detect genes expressed at very low levels via improved coverage for non-globin genes. however, this would not affect the analysis we do here as we filter out the genes expressed at very low levels across all samples. the globin genes were also removed from the gene expression matrix prior to normalisation and further analysis. removal of genes expressed at very low levels  per sample >  <dig> in at least  <dig> samples) resulted in a set of  <dig>  genes expressed in porcine peripheral blood. a multi-dimensional scaling in two dimensions  performed using this set of expressed genes revealed a clear separation of the samples by day  but not by shedding status  on either day .

for a broad overview of the functions attributed to the genes expressed in porcine blood, we performed a functional classification based on gene ontology  terms from go slim using the panther gene list analysis tool . in the biological processes category ,  <dig> % of the blood-expressed genes were annotated to metabolic process, 16% to cellular process,  <dig> % to cell communication and  <dig> % to transport. in the molecular functions category,  <dig> % of the genes were annotated to binding and  <dig> % to catalytic activity whereas in the cellular composition category, the dominant term was intracellular .

gene co-expression network constructed using gene expression data from uninfected pigs
gene expression profiles of day  <dig> samples of pigs were analysed using wgcna in order to identify gene co-expression patterns that may be associated with differences in faecal salmonella shedding counts of those pigs upon future challenge. after setting a minimum module size of  <dig> and merging modules with highly correlated  eigengenes , a total of  <dig> modules were found . these modules will be referred to by their colour labels henceforth, as is standard practice. the modules labelled by colours are depicted in the hierarchical clustering dendrogram provided in figure 
1a. to evaluate the robustness of the identified modules, we performed module stability analysis from bootstrapped networks . the module representations were fairly consistent across the majority of the bootstrapped networks .figure  <dig>

modules associated with differences in faecal salmonella shedding
to determine if any of the  <dig> modules of co-expressed genes identified in day  <dig> samples were associated with the observed differences in faecal salmonella shedding counts upon future salmonella challenge, we tested the correlations of the module eigengenes with the trait, aulc of faecal salmonella shedding counts. four modules were found significant at the defined cut-offs . of these, the pink, grey <dig> and darkorange modules showed negative correlations with the trait while the magenta module showed a positive correlation. figure 
1b depicts the module sizes and correlations of the module eigengenes to the trait. the module membership  versus gene significance  plots for these modules  showed that mm and gs are highly correlated, indicating that genes most significantly associated with the trait are often also the most important  elements of the respective modules. here, mm is a measure of the strength of a particular gene’s membership in a module obtained by correlating the gene’s expression profile with the module eigengene of that module. highly connected intramodular hub genes tend to have high mm values to the respective module. gs is a measure of the biological relevance of a gene with respect to the trait of interest obtained by correlating the gene’s expression profile with the trait. the gene expression profiles of genes within the four modules associated with salmonella shedding, across all samples ordered by aulc of salmonella shedding counts , indicate tight co-regulation with an overall higher expression in ls than ps for the pink, grey <dig> and darkorange modules and a lower expression in ls than ps for the magenta module. gene ontology enrichment tests  revealed that the grey <dig> and pink modules were related to immune functions whereas the darkorange module was related to signalling processes . the positively correlated magenta module was not significantly enriched for any go term. the ensembl ids of the genes within these four modules are provided in additional file 
 <dig> and the complete lists of go terms enriched in these modules are provided in additional file 
 <dig> 

salmonella shedding associated modules identified at day  <dig> are largely preserved at day 2
we speculated that the salmonella shedding associated modules found at day  <dig> may be preserved at day  <dig> and have a majority of their constituent genes still co-expressed if they indeed are involved in response to salmonella challenge. therefore, we first constructed a co-expression network using day  <dig> samples and tested for module preservation between day  <dig> and day  <dig> using the modulepreservation method 
 <cit>  implemented in wgcna package that calculates zsummary preservation scores. a zsummary score below  <dig> indicates no preservation, a score above  <dig> indicates strong preservation and a score between  <dig> to  <dig> indicates weak to moderate evidence of preservation 
 <cit> . most of the day  <dig> modules  were seen to be strongly preserved at day  <dig> including the pink and magenta modules , eight were weakly to moderately preserved including the grey <dig> and darkorange modules and only one was not preserved.figure  <dig>

differences in expression levels of salmonella shedding associated genes between low and persistent shedders and between days
de analyses between day  <dig> and day  <dig> performed separately for ls and ps samples identified  <dig> genes de  in ls and  <dig> genes de  in ps , with an overlap of  <dig>  genes. however, only  <dig> genes were significantly de between ls and ps at day  <dig>  the low number of genes de between ls and ps at day  <dig> was due to the fact that the direction of change was similar for most genes in both groups, though the degree of change in expression between days were higher in ps. from the expression patterns of the modules of co-expressed genes at day  <dig> that were associated with differences in faecal salmonella shedding counts, it was observed that genes within the grey <dig>  pink and darkorange modules were, in general, more highly expressed in ls than ps at day  <dig> whereas the opposite trend was observed for genes within the magenta module . if the genes within the modules are influencing salmonella shedding and thereby pathogen clearance and host resistance, one might hypothesise that genes within the modules negatively associated with salmonella shedding at day  <dig> would have a general up-regulation post-inoculation and those within the positively associated module would have a general down-regulation. to test this hypothesis, we first determined genes differentially expressed  between day  <dig> and day  <dig> p.i. using samples from both ls and ps taken together. a total of  <dig> genes were found de  of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated at day  <dig> p.i. . approximately 60% of the genes in both the pink  and grey <dig>  modules were up-regulated at day  <dig> p.i and  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the two modules, respectively. for genes in the darkorange module, 36%  were found significantly up-regulated at day  <dig> p.i. and none down-regulated. even when considering all genes in the three modules , the majority were more highly expressed at day  <dig> p.i. compared to day  <dig> . thus, the majority of genes within the modules negatively associated with salmonella shedding counts had a higher mean expression in ls than ps at day  <dig> and were significantly up-regulated in both ls and ps at day  <dig> . however, the positively associated magenta module, in spite of showing a majority of genes expressed lower in ls than ps at day  <dig>  did not show a trend of overall down-regulation at day  <dig> . in this case, we observed  <dig> %  of the genes to be significantly down-regulated,  <dig> %  significantly up-regulated, and the majority of the non-de genes were more highly expressed at day  <dig> figure  <dig>

differences in connectivity of salmonella shedding associated genes between low and persistent shedders and between days
connectivity is a central concept in network statistics. in gene co-expression networks, connectivity measures how correlated a gene is with all other network genes. here we calculated the scaled mean connectivities of all genes for four separate networks constructed using the following four subsets of the gene expression dataset: ls at day  <dig>  ps at day  <dig>  ls at day  <dig> and ps at day  <dig>  and tested if the connectivities differed significantly between ls and ps  when considering either all genes in the networks or only those genes belonging to the salmonella shedding associated modules . the mean, median and maximum connectivities were all higher for networks from ps samples than those from ls networks, at both days, when considering all genes in the networks. however, the opposite trend was seen when considering only the salmonella responsive genes within each network. at day  <dig>  the network connectivity measures were significantly higher in ls compared to ps for genes within the pink  and grey <dig>  modules, not significantly different for the darkorange module genes and significantly lower in ls compared to ps for the magenta  module genes . at day  <dig>  the network connectivity measures were significantly higher in ls compared to ps for genes within all four salmonella shedding associated modules . though significant differences in connectivity were also seen between ls and ps for some of the other modules not associated with salmonella shedding both in the day  <dig> and day  <dig> networks, it was remarkable that the two immune function related modules, pink and grey <dig>  showed significantly higher connectivities within the ls than ps even before salmonella challenge.figure  <dig>

prioritisation of candidate genes for salmonella shedding
for prioritising candidate genes within the salmonella shedding associated modules that could possibly determine better immune responses to salmonella challenge, we restricted further analysis to the pink and grey <dig> modules. these modules were found to be immune-related, had a majority of genes significantly up-regulated at day  <dig>  were well preserved with the corresponding modules from the network constructed using day  <dig> samples, and also showed overall higher gene connectivity measures in ls compared to ps in networks from both days. a total of  <dig> genes in the pink module and  <dig> in the grey <dig> module were up-regulated at day  <dig> p.i. network properties of this refined set of candidate genes within these two modules are provided in additional file 
 <dig>  this candidate gene list includes genes previously reported to be involved in the regulation of host responses to salmonella infection  or as having snps associated with salmonella faecal shedding , as well as those for which an association with salmonella is novel .

we prioritised the genes within these refined sets of candidates based on module membership, gene significance and also connectivity in ls at day  <dig> since we speculated that the significantly higher gene connectivity in ls may have a biological significance related to salmonella shedding. the top candidates in these modules with module membership above  <dig> , gene significance below - <dig>  and connectivity in ls at day  <dig> above  <dig> , ordered by connectivity are presented in table 
 <dig>  these top candidates are also among the most well connected genes in the network visualisations using the refined set of candidate genes within the pink  and grey <dig> modules .table  <dig>

further, as an independent validation of our results, we compared the expression patterns of a subset of the candidate genes reported here with the corresponding expression patterns from a previous microarray based salmonella challenge study involving a different set of ls and ps animals

 <dig>  except for slc26a <dig> and numb, all other genes showed expression patterns similar to those observed in our study: higher in ls than ps at day  <dig> and up-regulated in both ls and ps at day  <dig> p.i. in addition, the genes slc11a <dig>  tlr <dig> and cd <dig>  which are known to play important roles during salmonella infection, showed similar expression patterns as described above. figures comparing the expression patterns of these  <dig> genes between the two studies are provided in additional file

discussion
significant gains have been made in our understanding of host–pathogen interactions during salmonella infection 
 <cit> . several studies, involving a variety of different species of farm and model animals, have investigated the host response to salmonella infection and have successfully identified genes differentially expressed upon infection or gene variants and chromosomal loci associated with immune response traits during infection with salmonella <cit> . a genetic basis for differences in resistance to salmonella has also been shown with slc11a <dig> , the seminal example of a gene with genetic variants dramatically affecting resistance to bacterial infection 
 <cit> . while many studies have looked into the host response to salmonella infection 
 <cit> , relatively few have focused on identifying the genes whose variable expression among different individuals may be associated with differences in salmonella clearance and resistance.

initial characterisation of the pigs used in an earlier salmonella challenge study 
 <cit>  revealed a significant positive correlation between serum interferon-γ  levels at day  <dig> p.i. and faecal salmonella shedding levels at day  <dig> and day  <dig> p.i. the same study also demonstrated that the peak of both clinical symptoms  and salmonella shedding occurs at day  <dig> p.i. and that substantial whole blood transcriptome changes occur at day  <dig> p.i. compared to day  <dig> in pigs belonging to both ls and ps groups. therefore, here we chose to profile whole blood transcriptomes at the same time-points, day  <dig> and day  <dig>  but belonging to a different set of pigs, using rna-seq instead of microarrays, for a different purpose: to identify genes whose expression prior to inoculation is correlated with salmonella shedding levels observed p.i. the genes identified may serve as blood-based candidate biomarkers that could potentially be used to develop quick screening tests for determining the host’s resistance/susceptibility to salmonella infection and predicting their shedding characteristics early into or even before infection.

the extent of de and degree of change in expression between day  <dig> and day  <dig> were, in general, higher in ps than ls. this finding, as previously speculated 
 <cit> , may indicate that ls animals respond faster and more effectively against infection than ps so that by day  <dig>  while the ls are returning back to normal, the ps are still actively fighting the infection. with this in mind we believe that the comparison between ls and ps at day  <dig> likely identifies de due to differing levels of infection. a comparison at day  <dig>  on the other hand, stands to better highlight genes responsible for differences in the efficacy of the initial response to the bacteria, assuming that some of these genes exhibit expression differences prior to infection. however, the de analysis between ls and ps at day  <dig> did not yield any significant de genes here as well as in an earlier salmonella challenge study 
 <cit> . this failure to find de genes could be due to a combination of the subtlety of the expression differences, the relatively small sample size, and the strict multiple testing corrections. hence we used an alternative approach, wgcna, to find genes associated with salmonella shedding.

remarkably, the genes whose pre-inoculation expression profiles were found associated with post-inoculation salmonella shedding levels included major genes already reported in literature as de during salmonella infection and involved with host resistance against salmonella such as slc11a <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd <dig> and ccr <dig> <cit> . moreover, the majority of genes within the modules significantly associated with salmonella shedding, following further refinement based on up-regulation and de at day  <dig> , were found to have an established or possible role in innate defense against bacterial/salmonella infections. these include mainly the early innate immune response genes responsible for cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions , genes involved in toll-like receptor pathway , nf-kappa b signalling pathway , nod-like receptor signalling pathway  or otherwise linked to response to bacterial infections . prioritisation of these genes based on gene significance, module membership and gene connectivity in ls at day  <dig>  highlights some genes which have not been previously associated with salmonella infection. for example, little is known about the role of siglec <dig>  a member of the siglec family of sialic acid-binding lectins in host response to bacterial infection. however, it has been reported in humans that the absence of a functional siglec <dig>  results in attenuated cytokine response to some gram-negative bacteria in null individuals 
 <cit> .

the mean expression levels of the salmonella shedding associated genes at day  <dig> were generally higher in ls than ps and mostly up-regulated in both at day  <dig> compared to day  <dig>  in most instances, the expression was higher in ps than ls at day  <dig>  we showed, at least for the top candidate genes reported here, that the pattern of expression is consistent with that from a previous microarray based salmonella challenge study involving a different set of ls and ps animals. examining the connectivities of genes within the salmonella shedding associated modules in ls and ps, it became apparent that the genes in general showed higher connectivity in ls than ps, indicative of higher correlation/connection strengths with other network genes. the differences in connectivity measures for a set of genes between different conditions may signify differences in the co-ordination or strength of transcriptional regulation of that set of genes. highly connected genes  have been shown to play central roles in the biological processes that are represented by the module 
 <cit> , and strong positive correlations have been reported between gene connectivity within the whole network and gene essentiality 
 <cit> . here, the significantly higher connectivity despite the lack of significant de between ls and ps may be considered analogous to the results in a study on breast cancers of different histological grades 
 <cit> . the authors of that study concluded that the differential connectivity patterns were not due to primary alterations of hub gene expression, but rather due to more subtle changes in expression of numerous genes interacting with those hubs. further, they reported that complex epistatic interactions that underlie cellular functions might also be responsible for differences in network connectivity patterns as a function of a phenotypic trait. a study on aging in mice 
 <cit>  reported a decreasing correlation of gene expression within genetic modules and attributed this to changes in expression of certain transcription factors  as well as deterioration of chromatin structure with age. it is possible that genetic differences at mutiple levels as discussed above may contribute to the differences in strengths of coexpression and connectivity between ls and ps. exploring these contributions may be a direction for future research.

one of the limitations of our study is the absence of samples from time points post-inoculation but before day  <dig> p.i., which are crucial to capture the early immune response during which the ls pigs have effectively managed the salmonella challenge. secondly, this study would benefit from a larger sample size, which would provide more power to detect the subtle changes in expression expected between ls and ps animals. further experiments are required to rank the relative functional importance of our suggested candidate genes as contributors to distinct responses to salmonella challenge with respect to faecal salmonella shedding. however, the use of multiple criteria and strict cut-offs to refine the set of candidate genes, the agreement with existing literature regarding the immune related functions of many candidate genes and the concordance of the expression patterns of top candidate genes reported here with the corresponding expression patterns from an independent dataset, all lend further support to our predictions.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis integrates gene co-expression network analysis, gene-trait correlations and differential expression to provide new candidate regulators of salmonella shedding in pigs with implications for future use as biomarkers for selection of animals with reduced susceptibility to, or carriage of, salmonella or for predicting response to infection. the comparatively higher expression  and the significantly higher connectivity of genes within the salmonella shedding associated modules in ls compared to ps even before salmonella challenge may be factors that contribute to the decreased faecal salmonella shedding observed in ls following challenge.
