BACKGROUND
mycobacterium bovis is the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. isolation of m. bovis from tissues harvested from suspect animals remains the gold standard for diagnosis. although bacteriological culture is a reliable, definitive method for detection of m. bovis it takes a significant amount of time. detecting the presence of m. bovis dna in tissues prepared for culture may provide a simple, rapid diagnostic method.

mycobacteria other than m. bovis are routinely isolated from tissues submitted for diagnostic culture. these non-m. bovis mycobacteria may interfere with pcr diagnostic tests performed on these tissues if the test does not have sufficient specificity. most pcr primer pairs published to date were designed for identification of mycobacteria that have been isolated by culture. use of selective media and biochemical tests can eliminate many non-m. bovis mycobacteria prior to pcr tests; however, pcr assays on tissues that may have non-m. bovis mycobacteria requires sufficient specificity to differentiate environmental mycobacteria from m. bovis.

to address this possibility, dna from strains of mycobacteria other than m. bovis, that are routinely isolated from diagnostic samples, were tested for cross reactivity with the commonly used is <dig> pcr primer pairs used to detect m. bovis.

RESULTS
specificity of pcr primers
the following mycobacteria are routinely isolated from tissues submitted for m. bovis diagnostic culture at the national veterinary services laboratories: m. smegmatis, m. terrae, m. goodii, m. fortuitum, m. kansasii, m. wolinskyi, m. simiae, m. peregrinum, m. intracellulare, m. chelonae, m. avium subsp avium, and m.avium subsp paratuberculosis. dna from these strains were used to determine the specificity of two previously published pcr primer pairs is41/ <dig> <cit>  and is <dig> <cit> . both sets of primers generated a pcr product for m. bovis, m. terrae, m. goodii, and m. wolinskyi . the is41/ <dig> primer pair also detected m. fortuitum; whereas, is <dig> primer pair cross-reacted with m. peregrinum and m. chelonae.

development of real-time pcr primers with increased specificity
the cross reactivity of previously published primers with commonly isolated environmental mycobacteria necessitated the development of primers with greater specificity. primers and probe for real-time pcr were developed that targeted is <dig> . the primers were tested for specificity using the mycobacteria described above . the is6110_t primer pair generated a pcr product from m. bovis, m. wolinskyi and m. goodii using conventional pcr; however, using the primers and probe in a real-time pcr assay resulted in a positive reaction to only m. bovis and m. wolinskyi . a  <dig> bp region of m. wolinskyi and m. bovis genomes that contained the region amplified by the primers used in this paper were sequenced to determine if a test with higher specificity could be developed using this region. the amplified region from m. wolinskyi was 100% identical to that of m. bovis. portions of the 16s gene was sequenced to confirmed the identity of m. wolinskyi.

establishing assay conditions
the limit of detection for is6110_t was  <dig> fg of m. bovis dna. the limit of detection was determined using serial dilutions of m. bovis dna. clinical tissue samples will contain bovine  dna that may inhibit the real-time pcr reaction. to determine the effect of non-target dna on the real-time pcr reaction, increasing amounts of bovine dna was spiked with m. bovis dna. m. bovis was detectable in up to  <dig> μg of bovine dna. at  <dig> μg of bovine dna inhibition of the pcr was detected.

to test the utility of this assay to detect m. bovis in clinical samples, dna was isolated from tissue homogenates that were culture positive for m. bovis or m. smegmatis. real-time pcr using primers for m. bovis and bovine β-actin was performed on each sample in duplicate. β-actin served as a control to detect inhibition of the pcr reaction. a sample was considered positive when a pcr product was detected in both duplicates from β-actin and is <dig>  initial studies using both conventional and real-time pcr assays only detected 2/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> samples respectively. it was hypothesized that the low level of detection was due to relatively little m. bovis dna relative to bovine dna present in samples. to test this hypothesis, dna from  <dig> homogenized tissues that were culture positive for m. bovis and one that was culture positive for m. smegmatis were chosen. real-time pcr reactions were prepared with increasing amounts of dna from these samples . one of the four m. bovis culture positive samples was pcr positive when  <dig> ng and two of four when  <dig> ng of dna was used in the pcr reaction . increasing dna concentration did not result in detection of the remaining samples.

to increase the sensitivity of the assay, a nested pcr strategy was developed. initially, conventional pcr was performed using primer is <dig> and the is6110_t reverse primer to generate a  <dig> base pair product that encompasses the region targeted by the real-time pcr assay. five microliters of the initial pcr reaction was used as the template in the real-time pcr assay. the samples described above were tested using the nested assay. m. bovis dna was detected in all four of the samples from infected tissues.

detection of m. bovis in tissues from naturally infected animals
additional tissue homogenates were obtained to test the diagnostic potential of this assay. dna was isolated from tissues of m. bovis infected cattle  and non-m. bovis infected animals . of the  <dig> m. bovis culture positive tissues  <dig> were pcr positive; whereas, no pcr product was detected in the non-m. bovis infected tissues .

discussion
a number of factors may affect the ability of a pcr based test to be successful. uncharacterized pcr inhibitors can be carried over from dna isolation procedures from blood and tissues. although these may be a cause of concern, they are irrelevant if primers and probes with sufficient specificity are not available. environmental mycobacteria present in lymph nodes submitted for diagnostic testing can confound assays that lack sufficient specificity. detection of m. tuberculosis complex species using primers to is <dig> is well established; as evidenced by the large number of publications referencing the original publication by eisenach et al.  <cit> . in the usa, is <dig> is the diagnostic target used at national veterinary services laboratories for detection of m. bovis in fixed tissues  <cit> . most publications testing the specificity of the method of eisenach et al. are designed to detect m. tuberculosis with specificity being tested against mycobacteria thought to be common in humans. because cattle may be infected with a different subset of non-tuberculous mycobacteria than those infecting humans, we sought to determine if established pcr protocols targeting is <dig> would be appropriate for strains isolated from cattle in the usa. in the present study, eisenach et al. primers cross-reacted with mycobacteria other than m. tuberculosis complex species . redesign of the primers and the addition of a probe increased the specificity against strains commonly isolated from cattle in the usa.

cross-reactivity to m. wolinskyi remained after redesign of the probe used in the real-time pcr reaction. sequencing of the region targeted by the is <dig> primers and probes revealed that the region was identical between m. bovis and m. wolinskyi. the region of the is <dig> that is targeted by these primers is in the 5' region of the transposase gene, which may be common between is <dig> and another insertion sequence in m. wolinskyi. the 16s gene of the m. wolinskyi sample used in this study was sequenced to confirm the identity of the isolate. the impact of this cross reactivity will be relatively minor since m. wolinskyi was only isolated  <dig> times between  <dig> and october  <dig> 

thirty m. bovis infected and  <dig> non-m. bovis infected tissues were used to test the utility of this assay. none of the tissues from non-m. bovis infected animals were positive by pcr. although the sample size is small the apparent specificity is 100% .

this assay detected m. bovis dna in  <dig> of the  <dig> culture positive samples tested, with an apparent sensitivity of  <dig> % . several methodologies have previously been employed to increase sensitivity. parra et al. used a capture probe to isolate mycobacterial dna from tissue homogenates  <cit>  achieving a similar sensitivity  to that reported here. taylor et al. reported a sensitivity of 70% when performing pcr directly on tissue homogenates, but increased the sensitivity to 91% when pcr was only performed on dna isolated from lesions excised from the tissues rather than whole tissue homogenates  <cit> . the limitation of this method is that the assay can only be performed on tissues that have visible lesions, thus excluding samples without readily apparent lesions.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of a pcr assay to detect m. bovis in tissue homogenates may provide a more rapid method for providing diagnostic test results to field veterinarians than culture. the is6110_t real-time pcr assay provides increased specificity over previously published is <dig> assays with a sensitivity of  <dig> %. a large-scale study is needed to determine if the sensitivity of the assays are adequate for the bovine tb eradication program in the usa.
