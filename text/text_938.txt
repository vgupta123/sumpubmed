BACKGROUND
tannase  specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of the galloyl ester bonds in hydrolyzable tannins that occur widely in the plant kingdom and are considered to be a protective strategy against microbial attack  <cit> . the enzyme was first reported in fungal genera  and is used in tea, wine, and beer processing for removal of insoluble condensation products composed of caffeine and tea flavonoids, including catechins  <cit> . the first indication of bacterial tannase was reported more than 20 years ago, based on methylgallate-hydrolytic activity observed in streptococcus gallolyticus and lonepinella koalarum found in the alimentary tract of koalas feeding on tannin-rich eucalyptus leaves, implying a possible symbiotic relationship between the animal and these bacteria  <cit> .

to date, tannase production has been identified in other bacterial species  <cit> , including lactobacilli species of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus, which were isolated from fermented vegetables  <cit> . l. plantarum, l. paraplantarum, and l. pentosus have been reported to play an important role in the production of many fermented foods including dairy products, silage, and pickled vegetables, thus being proposed as a potential probiotic. furthermore, it has been speculated that their tannase activities in the human alimentary tract have significant effects on pharmacological aspects of dietary tannins that are prevalent in beverages and teas  <cit> . recently, we identified tanlpl  within the genome of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> and found it to be similar to a known bacterial tannase gene in staphylococcus lugdunensis <cit> . subsequently, tanlpl was expressed in e. coli <cit>  to show remarkable differences to characterized fungal tannases. however, little is known about genes responsible for tannase activities of l. paraplantarum and l. pentosus.

in this study, we aim to identify tannase genes in other lactobacilli, such as l. paraplantarum and l. pentosus and to compare them with tanlpl in l. plantarum as well as to distinguish their structural and enzymological characteristics.

dna manipulation
genomic dna from the bacterial strains was prepared following the method of marmur  <cit> . the purity and amount of dna in each preparation was estimated spectrophotometrically, and stored at 4°c until use. isolated genomic dna was subjected to pcrs along with various sets of primers for cloning of the tannase encoding genes.

all pcr reactions were performed with ex taq polymerase . nucleotide sequences were determined using a bigdye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sequencing products were read on an abi prism  <dig> genetic analyzer . the universal primers, t <dig> promoter primer, and sp <dig> promoter primer, were used for sequencing.

identification of tannase encoding genes of l. paraplantarum and l. pentosus
based on the tanlpl sequence , primer pair tanlp-1f  and tanlp-1r  were designed to obtain partial tannase genes in l. paraplantarum nso <dig>  and l. pentosus 22a- <dig> . amplified products were cloned into pgem-t easy cloning vector and sequenced. to determine the entire sequences of orf, inverse pcr was performed as described by willis et al.  <cit> . in brief, genomic dna  of l. paraplantarum nso <dig> and l. pentosus 22a- <dig> was digested with hincii and smai respectively, and purified with the high pure pcr purification kit  following the manufacturer’s protocol. the recovered dna were incubated for 12 h at 15°c with  <dig> u of t <dig> dna ligase  to obtain circularized dna as templates for inverse pcr using the following primer sets: p <dig>  and p <dig>  for tanlpa, p <dig>  and p <dig>  for tanlpe. the sequencing of inverse pcr products was performed as described above, and the sequences determined were compared with the tannase gene sequences available in genbank using the blast program .

sequencing of tannase genes in other lactobacilli isolates and their phylogenetic analysis
we designed primers sets based on tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe sequences and following pairs of primers were used to amplify tannase gene sequences in other  <dig> lactobacilli isolates: tanlpl-f  and tanlpl-r , tanlpa-f  and tanlpa-r , and tanlpe-f  and tanlpe-r . the amplified pcr fragment was cloned into pgem-t easy cloning vector, and the dna sequence was determined.

construction of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe expression plasmids
the coding regions of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe were amplified by pcr using the following three primers pairs: for tanlpl; 5′-catatgtaaccgattgctttttgatg-3′  and 5′-aagcttttggcacaagccatcaatccagga-3′ , for tanlpa; 5′-catatgagtaaccgattgatttttgatg-3′  and 5′-aagcttttgacacaagtgatcaatccaggc-3′ , and for tanlpe; 5′-catatgacggatactttgatttttgatg-3′  and 5′-ggatccctgacacaggccatcgatcca-3′ . the amplified fragment was cloned into pgem-t easy cloning vector and sequenced to confirm the absence of pcr errors. the plasmid was digested with ndei and hindiii, or ndei and bamhi, and the resultant  <dig> -kb dna fragment was ligated with pbe-s vector  that had been digested with ndei and hindiii, or ndei and bamhi, to generate pbe-tanlpl, -tanlpa, and -tanlpe. those of pbe-s construct in which the orf for tannase genes were fused with sequences for  <dig> unique signal peptides and the ligated products were transformed into b. subtilis rik  <dig> using b. subtilis secretory protein expression system  according to manufacture’s protocol. the transformed cells were plated onto lb agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin. to screen for the clones with high tannase activity, the spectrophotometric method of sharma et al.  <cit>  was used.

enzyme purification
for the production of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe that contained his tags at the c-termini, the transformed b. subtilis rik  <dig> cells that showed highest tannase activities were inoculated into lb medium  containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin and grown for 24 h at 37°c with gentle shaking. cells were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 5 min and resuspended in buffer a  containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and then disrupted by rigorous shaking with glass beads  for 5 min. the crude cell-free extract was prepared by removal of cell debris by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 20 min. the recombinant protein with a his tag was purified using a talon® metal affinity resin  according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the exception that 10% glycerol was added to all buffers. the purified recombinant tannase proteins were dialyzed against buffer b . the purity of the recombinant proteins was checked by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the protein concentration was measured with a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer .

amino acid sequencing
the n-terminal amino acid sequence of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe were determined by automated edman degradation using a ppsq- <dig> protein sequencer .

effects of ph and temperature on tannase activity
the activity of the purified recombinant tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe on ph and temperature was determined in comparison with that of a commercially available a. oryzae tannase . all reaction mixtures contained  <dig> nm of the purified tannase and 1 mm mg as a substrate. the optimal ph of the enzyme was determined at 37°c for 15 min in the range of ph  <dig> – <dig>  using the following buffers: 50 mm sodium citrate buffer , 50 mm phosphate buffer , 50 mm tris–hcl buffer , and 50 mm nahco <dig> buffer . the optimum temperature was determined by measuring the tannase activity at 20–55°c in 50 mm tris–hcl  for tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe, and in 50 mm sodium citrate  for a. oryzae tannase. the reaction products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography  as described previously  <cit> . one unit of tannase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release  <dig> μmol of gallic acid in 1 min under specified conditions.

effects of various chemicals on tannase activity
effects of various metal ions , edta, urea, β-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  on the lactobacilli tannase activities were investigated. activity of each enzyme was estimated using 1 mm mg as substrate with 1 mm each of the above chemicals at 37°c for 15 min under the predetermined optimal ph condition. the reaction products were analyzed by hplc as described above.

kinetic constant of lactobacilli tannase
the reaction mixture  was prepared in 50 mm tris–hcl  for tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe, or 50 mm sodium citrate  for a. oryzae tannase, containing each of the substrates , and the enzyme . the mixture without enzyme was once preincubated at 37°c for 10 min, and the reaction was started by adding the enzyme. after incubation at 37°c for 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 20%  phosphoric acid to be subjected directly to hplc analysis. km and vmax values were calculated from a hanes–woolf plot. kcat value was calculated based on the molecular mass of each tannase enzyme .

RESULTS
sequence analysis of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe
the full-length nucleotide sequence of the tanlpa  of l. paraplantarum nso <dig> and tanlpe  of l. pentosus 22a- <dig> as determined by inverse pcr predicted proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues, with molecular mass of  <dig>  da and  <dig>  da, respectively. tanlpa and tanlpe turned out to be homologs of tanlpl with 88% and 72% amino acid identity, respectively. the average dn/ds ratios for three lactobacilli tannase was  <dig>  suggesting that these genes are under neutral  or purifying selection . the levels of sequence identity to other known bacterial tannases, such as tana from s. lugdunensis and two putative tannase-coding genes from the whole genome sequence of s. gallolyticus ucn <dig>  were less than 30% . however, alignment analysis revealed that these enzymes contained a highly conserved gly-x-ser-x-gly motif , typical of the catalytic triad with a nucleophilic serine found in serine hydrolases  <cit>  . although the enzymes were supposed to be secreted, signalp  <dig>  server  analysis failed to suggest any plausible signal peptide sequence.

we sequenced the tannase-coding genes from  <dig> additional isolates of l. plantarum, l. paraplantarum, and l. pentosus . their amino acid sequences composed the clades subdividing the species ranged from  <dig> %-100% for l. plantarum,  <dig> %-100% for l. paraplantarum, and  <dig> %-100% for l. pentosus . the comparative analysis revealed that the lactobacilli tannase genes had a restricted diversity, forming a distinct phylogenetic cluster among the known tannases . tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe are representing a novel subfamily as they showed low amino acid sequence similarity less than 60% with any other reported tannases in ddbj/embl/genbank databases.

expression and purification of recombinant tannase
it should be noted that we did not obtain any clone that secreted a measurable amount of recombinant tannase protein in the spent medium. therefore, we obtained the purified recombinant enzymes from bacterial cells of the clones of transformed b. subtilis. each of the three lactobacilli tannase genes  was expressed as c-terminal his-tag fusion proteins with n-terminal secretion signal peptide which were originating from ybdk protein, which was selected from several clones showed high tannase activity, under the control of apre promoter in b. subtilis rik  <dig>  in all cases, no tannase activity was found in the culture media, while washed b. subtilis cells showed appreciable activity. moreover, only after tannase activity appeared in the supernatant of cultures the lysozyme treatment providing the protoplast, suggesting that the secreted recombinant tannases might be associated with the cell wall. the cells  were harvested and disrupted by shaking with glass beads prior to purification of the recombinant tannases were purified by the metal affinity chromatography to the purities greater than 95% . molecular masses of the recombinant tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe were approximately 50 kda, 50 kda, and 51 kda, respectively , which well agreed with the estimation from their respective amino acid sequences. amino acid sequencing confirmed that the n-terminal sequences of purified tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe matched the corresponding sequence predicted from tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe, respectively.

effects of ph, temperature, and chemicals on tannase activity
enzymatic properties of the lactobacilli tannases were investigated using mg as a substrate. tanlpl and tanlpa showed maximum activities at ph  <dig>  and at 40°c, whereas those of tanlpe were optimal at ph  <dig>  and at 35°c . although tanlpl and tanlpa sustained more than 80% of their enzymatic activities at a ph range of  <dig> – <dig> , tanlpe drastically lost its activity above ph  <dig> . in addition, the activity of tanlpe was always lower than that of tanlpl and tanlpa at temperatures higher than 40°c. in contrast, the activity of a. oryzae tannase showed a maximum level at approximately ph  <dig>  and 45–50°c, while it dropped drastically at ph values above  <dig>  and below  <dig> , but retained more than 50% activity was between 20°c and 60°c .

the tannase activities of the purified recombinant enzymes were partially inhibited by but not significantly affected by pmsf, edta, and urea . some metal ions including mn2+, ca2+, and mg2+ slightly interfered the enzymes. especially, tanlpl and tanlpe were affected to decrease the activity down to  <dig> % and  <dig> % by the presence of zn2+, respectively. all three recombinant tannases were inhibited in the presence of 1 mm feso <dig> approximately down to one fourth levels .

discussion
in this study, tanlpa from l. paraplantarum nso <dig> and tanlpe from l. pentosus 22a- <dig>  cloned to reveal their high amino acid identity to tanlpl from l. plantarum. recently, ren et al.  <cit>  reported a crystal structure of tannase from l. plantarum, that has 99% amino acid identity to tanlpl. they identified ser <dig>  his <dig>  and asp <dig> as a catalytic triad with a nucleophilic serine within the pentapeptide sequence motif gly161-x-ser163-x-gly <dig> of the crystal structure. alignment analysis indicated that all the three lactobacilli tannases, tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe contained the conserved gly-x-ser-x-gly motif in their amino acid sequences as the catalytic triad . in addition, we found that amino acid residues of asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and glu <dig>  considered to play a key role in binding of the enzyme to them corresponding galloyl site of the substrate  <cit> , were also conserved.

we sequenced a total of  <dig> possible lactobacilli tannase genes, forming a distinct phylogenetic clade among the tannase genes reported in databases. no other bacterial tannases in databases showed higher than 60% amino acid sequence similarity with tanlpl, tanlpa, or tanlpe, suggesting that the three lactobacilli tannases form a novel independent lineage of tannase superfamily.

although an increasing number of genome sequencing reports are revealing that bacteria possess various tannase genes, only few of them have been cloned and expressed in heterologous hosts  <cit> . we thus undertook the gene expression and protein purification of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe in b. subtilis. however, the recombinant tannases were not readily secreted into the culture medium, but were trapped within the cell walls. in agreement with our previous report  <cit> , the optimum temperature and ph for activities of tanlpl were 40°c and  <dig> , respectively. on the other hand, rodríguez et al.  <cit>  reported that cell-free extracts of the type strain l. plantarum cect 748t  had optimal tannase activity at ph  <dig>  and at 30°c. according to the available genome information of l. plantarum atcc 14917t, this strain is known to have at least two unique tannase genes in its genome, i.e., tanlpl and another gene . it might be possible that rodríguez et al.  <cit>  worked with the second one. the optimum temperature and ph of tanlpa were similar to those of tanlpl, whereas tanlpe was weaker at temperatures higher than 40°c. the number of proline residues was reported to contribute to the enzyme thermo-stability  <cit> . the difference might be due to the lower proline content of tanlpe , compared with tanlpl  and tanlpa .

most of lactobacilli species are acid tolerant reflecting the fact that they produce various organic acids during fermentation, and thought until recently, to be generally not considered alkali sensitive. nevertheless, sawatari et al.  <cit>  reported that some lactobacilli strains including l. plantarum and l. pentosus originating from plant materials showed growth at ph up to  <dig>  and alkali tolerance of the glycolytic enzymes of the strains. moreover, in turned out that l. pentosus cect  <dig> has been used as a starter to ferment lye-treated green olives at ph higher than  <dig>   <cit> . these facts and findings suggest that some lactobacilli are able to tolerate a very alkaline environment in some occasions for their survival. nishitani et al.  <cit>  speculated that tannase production might allow l. plantarum strains to accumulate high intracellular levels of mn2+, which is otherwise chelated by tannins, compensating for the absence of superoxide dismutase in l. plantarum and providing resistance to oxygen toxicity under aerobic conditions. if this is actually the case, the alkaline tolerant tannases may be beneficial for their survival under alkaline conditions.

it was reported that tannase activities were affected by several chemicals  <cit> . the activities of recombinant tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe were significantly affected by neither edta, mn2+, mg2+, ca2+, pmsf, nor urea. previously curiel et al.  <cit>  reported that the activity of tanlpl was greatly increased in the presence of ca2+ and was significantly inhibited in the presence of urea. notably, they used e. coli as a host for the expression of a recombinant n-terminal his-tagged tanlpl while we used b. subtilis and c-terminal his-tagged recombinant. in order to clarify the inconsistency further characterization is required, but the effects of edta, mn2+, and mg2+ were in good agreement.

tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe were not affected in 1 mm edta, implying that the enzymes do not depend on divalent metallic ions as co-factors. only the exception was fe2+, which was also shown to inhibit a tannase from penicillium chrysogenum <cit> .

previously  <cit> km value of tanlpl for mg was found to be lower than that of commercially available tannase of a. orzae. in this study, km and kcat values of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe were calculated not only for mg, but also for various catechin galloyl esters. km values of the enzymes on each these substrates were comparable; however, kcat/km values of tanlpa for egcg, ecg, cg, and gcg were significantly higher than those of tanlpl and tanlpe. the results suggest that the small differences in the amino acid sequences of tannase can exert such a drastic effect. interestingly, kcat/km values for egcg3″me of tanlpl and tanlpa were much lower than those for other catechins . egcg3″me is a derivative of egcg, in which the methoxyl group is located at the galloyl group of egcg. ren et al.  <cit>  showed that the hydrogen-bonding network which was observed between three hydroxyl groups of gallic acid and the side chains of asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and glu <dig> of lactobacilli tannase is important in enzyme-substrate complex. therefore, egcg3″me may not form a strong and stable complex with the enzymes.

tannins are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and bind readily with proteins or heavy metals to form insoluble complexes, thereby presumably acting as a defense mechanism in plants against microbial attacks  <cit> . tannins, such as tannic acid, methyl gallate, and catechin galloyl ester derivatives are structurally diverse. our study suggests that variety in bacterial tannases may reflect adaptation to various tannin substrates present in the environment. this is the first comparative study of closely related bacterial tannases, which may be as functionally diverse as bacterial β-glucosidases required for the break down of the plant-based glucosides  <cit> , reflecting the possible “co-evolutional arms race” between plants and bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we identified the genes encoding tannase, designated tanlpa and tanlpe, were cloned from lactobacillus paraplantarum nso <dig> and lactobacillus pentosus 21a- <dig>  which shared 88% and 72% amino acid identity with tanlpl, cloned from lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917t, respectively. our comparative analysis showed that lactobacillus tannase genes had a little diversity in each other, forming a phylogenetic cluster in the known tannase genes in silico. meanwhile, tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe that were recombinant enzymes of tanlpl, tanlpa, and tanlpe expressed in bacillus subtilis rik  <dig> showed appreciable difference in enzymological acitivity against several galloyl esters, in which tanlpa, for example, had markedly higher catalytic activity than tanlpl and tanlpe against some galloyl esters of green tea catechins . this is the first comparative study of closely related bacterial tannases.
