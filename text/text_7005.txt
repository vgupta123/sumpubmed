BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  form one of the largest gene families in the human genome and participate in a wide range of physiological and sensory functions. their ability to mediate specific signals over the cell membrane contributes to the fact that about 25% of the  <dig> top-selling pharmaceutical targets are gpcrs  <cit> . however, many of these receptors are still orphans with unknown functions. gpcrs can be classified into five main families; glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled/tas <dig> and secretin  <cit> . the characteristic 7tm domain is the hallmark of all gpcrs and the members within each of the five families are likely to share common descent. these main families can also be distinguished by different types of n-termini. most of the receptors from the glutamate, secretin, frizzled and the adhesion families have long n-termini with functional domains while very few of the rhodopsin receptors have such domains. the n-termini of the adhesion family, also known as family b <dig>  <cit>  or lnb-tm <dig>  <cit> , are very different from those of the other groups since these consist of long stretches rich in serine and threonine which produce a stalk-like formation projecting from the cell membrane. this structure is probably very important for cell-to-cell interactions. interestingly, these n-termini frequently contain multiple functional domains such as epidermal growth factor , cadherin, lectin, laminin, olfactomedin, immunoglobulin or trombospondin that are most commonly found in other types of protein such as integrins, cadherins and tyrosine kinases. while the rhodopsin family is by far the largest gpcr family with many well studied amine and peptide binding receptors, the adhesion family is the second largest family with  <dig> members in the human genome. several of them were identified recently  <cit>  and the functional roles of these are not well understood. the adhesion gpcrs can be further subdivided into groups i-viii based on phylogeny  and virtually all of them contain the gpcr proteolytic site  domain  <cit> .

we previously identified three novel receptors; gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig>  which phylogenetically cluster together with the adhesion gpcr family  <cit> . these receptors form adhesion group iii  <cit> . gpr <dig> is highly expressed in cortical layer  <dig> pyramidal neurons and in most parts of the thalamus and the spinal cord  <cit> . gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> are also known as tumor endothelial marker  <dig>  and tem5-like, respectively  <cit> . members of the tumor endothelial marker family were originally identified by searching for genes with both elevated expression under tumor angiogenesis  <cit>  and cell surface expression to facilitate the drug design process  <cit> . originally, tem <dig>  was classified as gpcr-like while tem5-like  has only been discussed in  <cit> . expression of both tem <dig> and tem5-like are elevated in human tumors and proteins for these genes were found to bind the human homologue of the drosophila discs large tumor suppressor gene  which localizes receptors to the cell surface  <cit> . with respect to localization by northern blot analysis, gpr <dig>  was identified throughout many peripheral human tissues with a low expression in the brain but high expression in human brain tumors  <cit> . a second study suggested a developmental role for gpr <dig>  <cit> . gpr <dig> is found in highly proliferative adult spermatogonial progenitor cells  and multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells  but is downregulated after differentiation, thus suggesting gpr <dig> as a marker for cultivation of spcs or mascs which may later be used for transplantation therapies  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to describe the evolutionary history of gpr <dig> and map the mrna expression pattern using in situ hybridization and real-time rt-pcr on mouse brain and peripheral tissues. additionally, we used immunohistochemistry to localize gpr <dig> to a given cell type and animal models to determine whether expression of this new gpcr changes in response to pathophysiological stimuli.

methods
sequence retrieval and editing
full-length adhesion-sequences for human , mouse   <cit>  and chicken   <cit>  were downloaded from previously published articles. the sequence for rat  corresponded to accession number xp_ <dig> . the human sequences were truncated to include only the tm regions according to rps-blast at   and served as probes against tetraodon nigroviridis , takifugu rubripes  and drosophila melanogaster . tn and tr were both investigated using blast-like alignment tool  searches against their genome at . dm, on the other hand, was searched against its proteome with blastp searches at . to rule out further hits, the previously obtained sequences were used as probes in new blat-searches against their respective genomes. the potential sequences were manually assembled in editseq from the dna-star package version  <dig>   according to the canonical splice site gt...ag. the assembled sequences were then aligned with their probes in the windows version of clustalw  <dig>   <cit>  to confirm consistency of splice sites. the n-terminals of the selected sequences were assembled in the same manner as mentioned above but with the full-length human protein as probes. they were then searched for their domain extent in rps-blast with a cutoff value of  <dig> .

adhesion confirmation
to confirm that the sequences of interest were adhesion gpcr members, an in-house program was applied. the program searched the sequences against a blast database comprised of all human gpcr families  and additional sequences from the methuselah family  <cit>  and the camp family  <cit> . the sequences had to fulfill the following criteria; that the first three hits were indeed adhesion and that an overall of five of the first ten hits were adhesion.

phylogenetic analysis
the newly discovered sequences related to gpr <dig> and their homologs were collected into a fasta file. the entire human adhesion gpcr repertoire together with gg and mm members of group iii, according to previous division of the adhesion family conducted by bjarnadottir and colleagues  <cit> , additional methuselah sequences  <cit>  and the complete human secretin family  was also included in the file. subsequent multiple alignments were performed on the file using the windows version of clustalw  <dig>   <cit>  with default parameter settings. using seqboot from the win <dig> version of the phylip  <dig>  package  <cit> , the alignment was bootstrapped  <dig> times. the output file from seqboot was then subjected to protdist from the win <dig> version of the phylip  <dig>  package using the jones-taylor-thornton matrix  <cit> . the neighbour command with default settings, from the win <dig> version of the phylip  <dig>  package, was then used to construct neighbour-joining trees from the distance file produced by protdist. in order to combine the trees into a consensus tree, the command consense from the win <dig> version of the phylip  <dig>  package was used with the majority rule and then plotted in the win <dig> version of treeview  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the consensus tree was then weighted in treepuzzle version  <dig>   <cit>  with the settings; tree reconstruction, evaluate user-defined trees, exact  parameter estimates, mueller-vingron model of substitution, gamma distributed rates as model of heterogeneity estimated from the data set and eight categories of gamma rate. the remaining parameters were kept default.

experimental subjects
all experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committees in sweden, portugal and the united states. animal care procedures followed the guidelines of swedish regulation  and eu legislation .

gene expression using qpcr
tissue collection
to prepare the mouse tissue panel,  <dig> adult, male sv <dig>  were housed in a climate-controlled facility  with constant temperature  and 55% humidity. animals were given  <dig> days to acclimatize to the local conditions and had free access to water and r <dig> food pellets . between  <dig> and  <dig> hours into the light period, animals were decapitated for dissection of brains and various peripheral tissues. brains were placed in a brain matrix for dissection into areas indicated in figure  <dig> while peripheral organs were taken in their entirety. all samples were frozen on a dry ice block before immersion into rnalater solution . following  <dig> hr of incubation at room temperature to allow complete penetration of the tissue, samples were stored at -80°c until further processing.

rna extraction and cdna synthesis
tissue samples were homogenized in trizol reagent  using a branson sonicator. total rna was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol . to remove contamination, samples were treated with dnase i  at 37°c for  <dig> hours followed by  <dig> minutes at 75°c to inactivate the enzyme. to confirm that there was no dna contamination, a pcr was performed on the rna sample using reference gene gapdh as a positive control. if bands were detected after this pcr, dnase i treatment was repeated until no amplification was observed in the rna. the concentration of rna was measured with the nanodrop® nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . cdna was then synthesized according to the manufacturer's protocol with m-mlv reverse transcriptase  and random hexamers . to ensure presence of cdna in the samples, a pcr was run  but this time a band was expected for each sample.

primer design
primers were designed using beacon designer v <dig>   and specificity was verified via a blast search against the genome. mouse primers  were as follows: gpr <dig> , reference genes , f – gcc ttc cgt gtt cct acc, r – gcc tgc ttc acc acc ttc; β-tubulin, f – agt gct cct ctt cta cag, r – tat ctc cgt ggt aag tgc; ribosomal protein l <dig>  f – aat cgc caa tgc caa ctc, r – gga atg gac agt cac agg; histone h3b, f – cct tgt ggg tct gtt tga g, r – cag ttg gat gtc ctt ggg; cyclophilin, f – ttt ggg aag gtg aaa gaa gg, r – aca gaa gga atg gtt tga tgg; β-actin, f – cct tct tgg gta tgg aat cct gtg, r – cag cac tgt gtt ggc ata gag g; succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit b, f – tgg tgg aac gga gac aag, r – cag cgg tag aca gag aag g).

qpcr
quantitative pcr was performed in 96-well plates with the myiq icycler real-time detection instrument . sybr green i  dissolved in tris-edta  was used as the fluorescent reporter. the  <dig> μl reaction volume consisted of  <dig> μl 10× pcr buffer,  <dig> mm dntp,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μl forward and reverse primer ,  <dig> μl dmso, 1: <dig> sybr green i,  <dig>  μl  taq dna polymerase  and  <dig>  μl rnase-free water mixed with  <dig> μl  of cdna template. for each primer pair,  <dig> pcr cycles were run with parameters of 95°c for  <dig> s,  <dig> –62°c  annealing for  <dig> s followed by extension at 72°c for  <dig> s. a melting curve analysis was performed following the cycles to ensure that a single pcr product was formed in the reaction. primers were originally optimized by running a temperature gradient  to give an optimal temperature of 62°c for mouse gpr <dig> 

normalization and data analysis
data was obtained using the myiq software  and a normalization factor was calculated using the  <dig> reference genes and the genorm method  <cit> . primer efficiency was calculated using the linregpcr method and corrected ct values were calculated using the assumption-free analysis method of  <cit> . expression in the tissue with the smallest value was set to  <dig> and all other values were expressed relative to this minimum. samples were run in duplicate and repeated if necessary.

tissue collection and sectioning
adult, male sv <dig> mice were anaesthetized with a 1: <dig> mixture of dormitor  and ketalar  and transcardially perfused with pbs followed by 4% formaldehyde. brains were dissected and then fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde. after washing in pbs, brains were embedded in 4% agarose and sectioned  on a leica vibratome. slices were then dehydrated through a series of methanol washes and stored in 100% methanol at -20°c until use.

synthesis of riboprobes
antisense and sense probes for gpr <dig> were synthesized from the bmap clone id#  <dig> . dna was prepared with the jetstar  <dig>  plasmid purification midi kit/ <dig>  and the clone was then sequenced at mwg  to verify the accuracy of the clone. the antisense probe was synthesized with t <dig> rna polymerase and restriction enzyme spei  while the sense probe was synthesized using t <dig> rna polymerase after restriction with aflii . both types of probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-utp . probe concentration was measured with the nanodrop® nd- <dig> spectrophotometer  before storage at -80°c.

antibodies
primary antibody dilutions were as follows: 1: <dig> mouse anti-pan cytokeratin , 1: <dig> chicken anti-gfap  and 1: <dig> for nucleic acid stain  <dig> -diamidino-2-phenylindole  . secondary antibodies were diluted as follows : 1: <dig> anti-mouse-alexa  <dig>  and 1: <dig> anti-chicken-alexa  <dig> 

modifications to the in situ protocol
primary antibodies were incubated at 4°c overnight simultaneously with the anti-dig antibody. sections were developed using the red fluorescent enzyme substrate fast red according to the manufacturer's instructions . slices were stained for  <dig> minutes in 1: <dig> diluted  <dig> -diamidino-2-phenylindole  in depc-treated water and then placed on superfrost plus glass slides  and protected from light. secondary antibodies were added to the glass and incubated for  <dig> hours followed by mounting with coverslip and the antifade dtg mounting medium ,  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig> , 90% glycerol).

image acquisition
slides were photographed using the zeiss laser scanning microscope lsm <dig> confocal microscope system version  <dig>  and zeiss lsm image examiner software. all  <dig> fluorophores were acquired together via customization of track settings and filter/mirror positions and channels were overlayed by the software. when necessary, the z-stack function was used to acquire images of several layers of the tissue which was rendered 3-dimensionally by the software to aid in visualization of the co-localization.

immunohistochemistry using gpr <dig> antibody
the rabbit polyclonal antibody against gpr <dig> was obtained from the swedish human proteomics resource project  <cit> . two naïve wistar rats were sacrificed at  <dig> weeks of age by decapitation and the brain was dissected and rapidly frozen in isopentane at -22°c followed by storage at -80°c until sectioning. sections of  <dig> μm were made using a cryostat, thaw-mounted onto superfrost plus slides  and stored at -20°c until analysis. sections were re-hydrated in pbs and fixed in methanol at -20°c followed by treatment with  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  sections were then incubated in blocking solution ) for  <dig>  hr and incubated overnight with primary antibodies ; anti-mct- <dig> in chicken at 1: <dig> ). after pbs wash, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies . finally, dapi nuclear stain  was added and sections were mounted in dtg medium as described previously.

induction of inflammatory response by lps
inflammation was induced by intraperitonial injection of lipopolysacharide  as described previously  <cit> . briefly, animals were injected i. p. with  <dig> μg/g body weight lps  or saline . at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after injection, the choroid plexus was rapidly removed and stored at -80°c until further processing. a minimum of five pools of choroid plexus from n =  <dig> animals were prepared and analyzed for each time point.

the rat traumatic brain injury  model
adult male long-evans rats weighing 280– <dig> g were purchased from harlan sprague-dawley . the controlled cortical impact model of tbi was used as previously described  <cit> . rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium  and were placed in a stereotactic frame. a 4-mm craniotomy was performed on the right side of the skull to expose the dura, with the center of the opening located  <dig> mm posterior to bregma and  <dig>  mm lateral to the midline. the velocity of impact was  <dig> m/sec and the duration of impact was  <dig> msec. the diameter of impactor's tip was  <dig>  mm and the depth of brain deformation was set at  <dig> mm. immediately after the insult, the scalp was closed with a nylon suture and the rats were allowed to recover in their cages. at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after injury , samples of the lateral ventricle choroid plexus and the hippocampus ipsilateral and contralateral to the injury side were collected for qpcr analysis. qpcr results are presented as the mean number of copies of gpr <dig> mrna per  <dig> copies of cyclophilin a mrna ± s.e.m. results were analyzed by anova followed by the neuman-keuls test for multiple comparisons. comparisons in gpr <dig> expression were made for ipsilateral vs contralateral tissues and over time within the ipsilateral and contralateral sides.

RESULTS
sequence retrieval and phylogenetic analysis
a phylogenetic tree was prepared using the adhesion, secretin, and methuselah families . gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> grouped together  and the drosophila receptor dmcg <dig> branches before the cluster of these three receptors. domains were identified through the conserved domain database  and the n-terminal regions with each domain are illustrated in figure 1b. the gpcr proteolytic site  domain is conserved in all sequences except dmcg <dig>  rodent gpr <dig> have longer n-terminal regions than human gpr <dig> but all contain hormone binding domains , immunoglobulin  and leucine-rich-repeat  domains. in contrast, teleosts either have an hbd and ig domain  or ig and lrr domain  but not all three. dmcg <dig>  however, contained all three domains and was therefore consistent with rodent gpr <dig>  an analysis of the conservation of intron-exon boundaries is provided in additional file  <dig>  intron-exon boundaries were conserved between human, rat and mouse gpr <dig> and between the two teleost sequences but there was no conservation of boundaries between these and dmcg <dig> 

gpr <dig> was present in the teleosts  and takifugu rubripes ) as well as the chicken and mammals. the full alignment of these sequences is presented in additional file  <dig>  amino acid similarity in the transmembrane regions was high between human and mouse  and also human and chicken  and human versus the teleosts . dmcg <dig> had a  <dig> % amino acid similarity with the human gpr <dig> and similarity to tn and tr was  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

gpr <dig> expression via qpcr
to obtain an overview of the expression of mrna for gpr <dig>  qpcr was performed on a panel of mouse brain regions and peripheral organs . to simplify presentation, values were normalized to the tissue with minimum expression of gpr <dig> . expression in most brain tissues was approximately 2-fold that of the colliculus such that no differential pattern of expression was observed between striatum, hippocampus or thalamus. in particular, cortical expression of gpr <dig> was nearly 8-fold higher than that of the colliculus while hypothalamic expression was roughly  <dig> -fold higher. expression in the periphery was higher compared to the brain ; heart , liver , kidney  and pancreas . highest overall expression for gpr <dig> was observed in the lungs .

gpr <dig> expression via in situ hybridization
for localization, in situ hybridization was performed using the visible enzyme substrate bm-purple and  <dig> ng of digoxigenin-labeled gpr <dig> probe. the complete series of this can be seen in additional file  <dig>  staining was limited to two key areas; the choroid plexus and neighbouring cerebral cortex  and the piriform cortex area  <dig>  while no staining was observed in the hippocampus. a sense probe for gpr <dig> did not stain these areas .

cellular localization of gpr125
to co-localize gpr <dig> expression to a given cell type, a combined in situ hybridization/immunohistochemistry protocol was used. gpr <dig> was labeled with the fluorescent enzyme substrate fast red and could be localized to the cytoplasm around the cell nuclei labeled with dapi . gpr <dig> was co-localized to cells of the choroid plexus  using the epithelial-cell-specific antibody pan-cytokeratin . an enlargement using a 63× objective  clearly indicates co-localization of gpr <dig> in choroid plexus cells. localization of gpr125-positive staining in the choroid plexus itself was confirmed using an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein  which stains gfap-positive ependymal cells that line the ventricle walls .

to demonstrate localization of the gpr <dig> protein in the choroid plexus, sections were labeled with the gpr <dig> antibody . using the epithelial cell-specific cytokeratin antibody and the z-stack function of the confocal microscope, gpr <dig> staining  was observed in the central portion of the choroid plexus with some overlap with the cytokeratin staining  which marks the barrier region of the choroid plexus . localization of this in the choroid plexus from a 3-week-old animal also indicates central nervous system expression in pre-adolescence. gpr <dig> did not, however, co-localize with the cerebral vasculature  as illustrated by double staining with the monocarboxylate transporter mct- <dig> which labels the cerebral vasculature and the walls of the ventricle  <cit> .

expression of gpr <dig> after induction of inflammation
to determine whether gpr <dig> may have an immune function, inflammation was induced by injection of lps and choroid plexus samples were collected at various times after injection. expression of gpr <dig>  as measured by qpcr, is illustrated in figure 2b. no differences were observed , thus indicating that induction of inflammatory response does not change gpr <dig> mrna expression in the choroid plexus.

expression of gpr <dig> after tbi
to determine whether gpr <dig> expression changes in response to brain injury, gpr <dig> mrna in the choroid plexus and hippocampus was measured after tbi . gpr <dig> expression in the choroid plexus significantly changed after injury . at  <dig> h post-tbi, the level of expression of gpr <dig> in both the ipsilateral and contralateral plexuses was higher than those observed at  <dig> and  <dig> days  post-tbi. furthermore, the expression of gpr <dig> in the ipsilateral choroid plexus at  <dig> h after injury was elevated compared to the levels found in both the contralateral and ipsilateral plexuses at  <dig>  and  <dig> days  post-tbi. in addition, a significant difference  in gpr <dig> mrna between the ipsilateral and contralateral plexuses was observed at  <dig> h post-tbi. gpr <dig> expression in the hippocampus was also significantly affected by injury . the expression of gpr <dig> in the contralateral hippocampus at  <dig> day post-tbi was increased compared to the expression levels observed in both the contralateral and ipsilateral hippocampi at  <dig>  and  <dig> h  after injury. additionally, a significant difference  in gpr <dig> expression between the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi was observed at  <dig> day post-tbi. overall, gpr <dig> expression transiently increased in the choroid plexus at  <dig> h post-tbi followed by a delayed transient increase in the hippocampus at  <dig> day post-tbi.

discussion
gpr <dig> is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate genomes. we found this gene to be present in fish, the two teleosts , as well as chicken, suggesting that this gene appeared at least  <dig> million years ago. it is, therefore, likely to be present in most vertebrates. moreover, all the vertebrate species we investigated had a single copy of a gpr <dig> gene without any duplicates. this is in contrast to gpr <dig> which is present in fish together with an extra copy termed gpr123-like  <cit>  and some other adhesion gpcrs that show differences in gene repertoire between mammals  <cit> . gpr <dig>  however, does not seem to be present in teleosts while it is found in chicken. interestingly, our evolutionary mining and phylogenetic analysis identified a drosophila sequence, dmcg <dig>  which is a common ancestor for the entire group iii of adhesion gpcrs. dmcg <dig> did not group with other drosophila sequences, other adhesion gpcrs or the methuselah-like gpcrs found in drosophila  <cit> , further supporting the notion that this is an ancestral gene to group iii. dmcg <dig> had approximately 20% sequence identity to gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> but has few introns and, thus, less complex genomic structure than its descents in fish and mammals . the fish genes have lower genomic complexity which suggests an increase over evolution in the number of introns in this lineage which concurs with the hypothesis that intron numbers in gpcrs are increasing through the evolution  <cit> . interestingly, dmcg <dig> shares ig, lrr and hbd domains with the fish and mammalian gpr <dig> as well as the mammalian gpr <dig> , providing further strong support for the suggestion that this is a common ancestor to this group. a  <dig> % amino acid sequence similarity was observed to human gpr <dig> and both genes contain hbd, ig and two lrr domains in the n-terminal regions. however, dmcg <dig> does not contain a gps domain which is surprising as the gps domain is likely to be found in common ancestors to all the adhesion gpcrs  <cit> . in addition to this, we performed a second analysis using the amphioxus sequence published from our recent report  <cit>  and this branch coincided with dmcg <dig>  suggesting similar conclusions with respect to ancestry and conservation.

the study on a wide tissue panel shows that the mrna for gpr <dig> was expressed in the periphery  but also in the brain which is in line with previous studies by yamamoto and colleagues  <cit> . our more detailed mapping of the brain found highly specific expression of gpr <dig> in cells of the choroid plexus in the mouse brain. the choroid plexus is the major source of cerebrospinal fluid  and is a site of the blood-csf barrier  <cit> . choroid plexus cells are of epithelial origin  <cit>  and were therefore immunopositive for cytokeratin which is a protein specific for epithelial cells  <cit> . in the choroid plexus, the pattern of staining for gpr <dig> was similar to that found for cytokeratin staining and its filamentous appearance suggests a role of this receptor in cell-cell adhesion or choroid plexus barrier function. immunostaining for gpr <dig> in 3-week-old rats also confirms the expression of this receptor in the pre-adolescence period and suggests a functional role in postnatal development in addition to the previously reported early developmental properties  <cit> . interestingly, a choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid is present in all vertebrate species but not amphioxus  <cit> . therefore, selective localization of gpr <dig> in the choroid plexus concurs with our evolutionary findings and suggests a conserved function important for vertebrates.

with knowledge of the evolutionary history and localization of gpr <dig>  it is possible to search for the function of this gpcr. the search for adhesion receptor function is difficult and the function of very few of these receptors have been determined compared to other gpcr classes  <cit> . brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor i  is one adhesion receptor of known function which recognizes phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells and subsequently promotes engulfment of these cells  <cit> . the involvement of bai <dig> in tumor growth  <cit>  and the report of elevated gpr <dig> in human tumors  <cit>  suggests one line of research to decipher the function of gpr <dig>  consultation of protein-protein interaction databases  suggests interaction of gpr <dig> with synapse-associated protein  <dig>  which was previously reported in  <cit>  and latrophilin, a protein involved in synaptic function and carbohydrate binding  <cit> . we observed a hormone binding domain in gpr <dig> but it is difficult to speculate which hormone may bind to this. however, this does suggest a role of gpr <dig> in the transfer of a message from the periphery via some circulating hormone, thus forming the basis of our study of inflammation and response to brain injury.

very few genes are expressed selectively in specific brain structures  <cit>  or brain cell types, but our results show abundant and specific expression in cells of the choroid plexus as determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. although we also found some expression in the cortex and periphery, it is likely that gpr <dig> may serve as a specific marker for choroid plexus cells and may thus be useful for the specific targeting of choroid plexus function in transgenic animals. we have previously described the selective production of transthyretin in the choroid plexus and this protein binds the β-amyloid peptide which is known to accumulate during alzheimer's disease  <cit> . the selective localization of gpr <dig> to the choroid plexus may also suggest a role for this in the etiology of alzheimer's.

the choroid plexus expresses a wide range of receptors and neuropeptides capable of signaling and immunological defense  <cit>  and we hypothesized that gpr <dig> could be involved in one of these processes. we have previously shown that induction of an inflammatory response by peripheral injection of lps increases mrna expression of cytokines il-1β and tnf-α in the choroid plexus  <cit> . inflammation itself induces expression of icam- <dig>  <cit>  and this adhesion molecule is thought to mediate influx of t-cells from the blood to the brain  <cit> . however, induction of inflammation by lps did not change gpr <dig> expression at any of the time points investigated, suggesting a lack of gpr <dig> regulation by changes in peripheral inflammatory mediators. despite these findings, gpr <dig> could be involved in signal transduction of peripheral inflammation to the brain through the choroid plexus via mechanisms not requiring alterations in gene expression.

function of the choroid plexus declines with age  <cit>  and these differences are even more pronounced in neurodegenerative diseases. for example, patients with alzheimer's disease have a 22% greater choroid plexus epithelial cell atrophy compared to controls  <cit>  and the decrease in cerebrospinal fluid  production with age  <cit>  may lead to the accumulation of β-amyloid peptides in the brain which could eventually form plaques  <cit> . additionally, cerebral ischemia produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion induces apoptotic cell death in the choroid plexus which spreads to the neighbouring hippocampus  <cit> . changes in gpr <dig> expression were measured after traumatic brain injury . whereas no differences between the contralateral and ipsilateral expression  were observed in the choroid plexus, the expression transiently increased at  <dig> h after injury followed by a decrease from  <dig> days onwards. increased expression in the hippocampus, a brain structure having a close contact with csf, was delayed until  <dig> day after injury. these observations suggest that the csf pathways may play a role in the injury-mediated regulation of gpr <dig> expression in both the choroid plexus and hippocampus  <cit> . these results illustrate an important difference in sensitivity between in situ hybridization and qpcr since the hippocampus was positive for mrna of gpr <dig> even though expression was considerably less than the cortex. nonetheless, tbi caused a significant induction of gpr <dig> mrna in the hippocampus after initial increases in the choroid plexus . this suggests that despite low basal levels of gpr <dig> expression in many brain regions, the gene can be upregulated in response to challenges such as brain injury.

real-time rt-pcr data identified mrna for gpr <dig> in small quantities throughout the brain. this was confirmed by in situ hybridization data as scattered expression across the cortex . the expression pattern of gpr <dig> is very different compared to gpr <dig>  <cit>  despite the similarity of these receptors and classification together as group iii adhesions. gpr <dig> is expressed in select regions of the brain and more widely in the peripheral organs while gpr <dig> was selectively expressed in the brain  <cit> . a difference in function is also suggested by the presence of hbd, ig and gps domains on gpr <dig> and the absence of these in gpr <dig> . the expression pattern of gpr <dig>  in human tissues corresponds somewhat to the expression pattern observed in mouse  <cit> . major differences include a lower expression in the human brain and virtually no expression in the human lung  <cit> . however, it is difficult to compare and quantify differences between northern blot measurements and qpcr results. importantly, gpr <dig> is highly upregulated in tumor samples from human brains  <cit> , which also suggests a role for gpr <dig> in cancer or an upregulation of this in relation to cancer progression.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, gpr <dig> is an adhesion gpcr which has a long evolutionary history in vertebrates. in contrast to gpr <dig> which is selectively expressed in the brain, gpr <dig> is expressed both in the brain and periphery. we have demonstrated that gpr <dig> expression is increased after tbi whereas no changes were observed after peripheral induction of inflammation. the connection of gpr <dig> expression to brain injury suggests a functional role of this receptor in response to and/or recovery from injury.
