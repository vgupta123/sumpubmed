BACKGROUND
following their initial discovery in worms, an increasing number of 18- <dig> nt-sized small rnas have been identified as crucial regulatory molecules in multicellular organisms, animal viruses, and unicellular organisms  <cit> . identification of abundant mirnas and other small regulatory rnas in different organisms is critical in improving our understanding of genome organization, genome biology, and evolution  <cit> . the silkworm, bombx mori , an important model organism used to investigate several fundamental biological phenomena , has been employed for silk production for about  <dig>  years. the recently sequenced b. mori is the first lepidopteran insect genome that provides a resource for comparative genomics studies, facilitating our understanding of insect evolution  <cit> . the latest mirna database release  presents  <dig> silkworm mirnas and two so-called mirna* sequences originating from the rna hairpin arm opposite the annotated mature mirna-containing arm  <cit> . however, some of these mirnas have been identified solely on the basis of sequence similarity to known orthologs, and have never been confirmed experimentally. furthermore, the total number of silkworm mirna genes is significantly lower than that in fruit fly  and human , and it is likely that further mirnas remain to be discovered in the silkworm.

to extend the known repertoire of small regulatory rnas expressed in the silkworm, we constructed and sequenced three small rna libraries prepared from the whole body  as well as the anterior-middle and posterior silk glands  of day- <dig> fifth instar larvae. the silk gland of b. mori is differentiated into anterior, middle, and posterior sections  <cit> . expression of all sericin genes is limited to the anterior and middle parts of the middle silk gland  <cit> , whereas the fibroin genes are expressed exclusively in the posterior silk gland  <cit> . both sericin and fibroin genes are topologically and temporally regulated at the transcriptional level in a concerted manner during larval development  <cit> . the spatial distribution of mirnas may contribute to the mechanistic understanding of concerted silk protein synthesis. each library was individually sequenced, and generated more than  <dig> million short reads, resulting in a total of  <dig> million reads, of which  <dig> , <dig> were mirna reads. the newly identified mirnas significantly enhance our knowledge of insect mirna species and provide insights into mirna evolution, biogenesis, and expression in insects.

RESULTS
overall complexity of small rna pools between the libraries
we obtained raw data by sequencing three small rna pools of the whole silkworm body from 5th-instar day- <dig> larvae, and anterior-middle and posterior silkworm silk glands, using the latest sequencing solexa technology  <cit> , filtered the low quality reads according to base quality value, trimmed the adaptor sequence at the 3' primer terminus, cleaned up 5' adaptor contaminants formed by ligation, and finally collected the small rnas and analyzed size distribution. the raw data and processed files of the three libraries have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus   <cit>  under accession number gse  <dig>  for analysis, all identical sequence reads in each small rna library were grouped and converted into unique sequences with associated counts of the individual reads. the flow results of data filtration for the three libraries are presented in additional file  <dig>  the total number of raw sequence reads in the whole body small rna library is  <dig> , <dig>  comprising  <dig> , <dig> low-quality reads  and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads . the majority of high-quality reads in this library  were longer than  <dig> nt, and used to map the silkworm genome assembly  using the soap program  <cit> , leading to  <dig> , <dig> genome-matched reads . all clean reads of at least  <dig> nt were divided into different categories of small rnas. the length distribution of high-quality reads was different among the three rna libraries . for example, some  <dig>   sequences in the whole body are canonical  <dig> nt mirnas, while  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads meet this length in the two silk gland libraries, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the respective high-quality reads. a significant fraction of the clean reads was derived from putative degradation products of rrnas, trnas, small nuclear rnas, and other non-coding rnas . another two large fractions were derived from unannotated genome sites  and highly repeated sequences in the genome . substantial portions  matched the exons and intergenic regions of protein-coding genes, respectively. in all,  <dig>  reads  were finally screened as mirna candidates in the whole body small rna library, and submitted for subsequent analyses. similarly, the total sequence reads of potential mirnas in the two silk gland libraries were  <dig>  and  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of high-quality clean reads, respectively. investigation of unique reads in the whole body and anterior-middle and posterior silk gland libraries revealed that the largest fractions were attributable to unannotated small rnas . upon addition of the known and unannotated mirna loci, the unique sequence reads of candidate mirnas in the three libraries were estimated as '923', ' <dig> ' and ' <dig> ', accounting for only  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the respective high-quality clean unique reads. after successive filtering of these data sets, we identified  <dig> unique mirna genes comprising  <dig> known and  <dig> novel genes, which collectively correspond to  <dig> independent genomic loci . notably, however, the majority of total or unique reads in this category in the three libraries were derived from annotated mirna hairpins. the sequence reads and hairpin structures of all sequenced mirnas in the whole body, anterior-middle silk gland, and posterior silk gland are detailed in additional files,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. reads counts and genomic distribution categories of the conserved and silkworm-specific mirnas were summarized in figure  <dig> 

the majority of known silkworm mirnas are conserved across species
to date, only  <dig> mirnas of bombyx mori have been reported   <cit> , and are available from latest mirbase database   <cit> . some of these mirnas were identified based solely on sequence similarity to known orthologous mirnas, and have never been confirmed experimentally   <cit> . here, we present evidence to support the authenticity of  <dig> known mirnas. the remaining  <dig> known mirnas, including bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-mir- <dig>  were not successfully sequenced, possibly because of low expression levels or stage-/tissue-specific transcription. in total,  <dig> conserved mirnas were firstly identified in the silkworm,  <dig> conserved mirnas were sequenced in all three rna libraries, while  <dig> were detected in only one or two small rna libraries . for example, bmo-mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were identified in the whole body, but not in the anterior-middle and posterior silk gland, opposite to the patterns shown by bmomir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-9b. sequence comparisons between silkworm mirna candidates and other mirnas present in mirbase  revealed that  <dig> silkworm mirnas  are widely distributed in over  <dig> species from invertebrates to vertebrates,  <dig>  are evolutionarily conserved throughout invertebrates,  <dig>  exist only in the insecta, and  <dig> known mirnas  are presently confined to b. mori . all conserved silkworm mirnas were classified into known families or currently undefined groups on the basis of sequence similarity . various families of these mirnas may have evolved for purposes as diverse as the phyla in which they occur. the identification of conserved mirnas as potential phylogenetic markers raises the possibility that mirnas serve as rapid evolutionary signaling molecules.

we observed heterogeneity at the 5' and 3' ends of sequenced tags derived from the same arms of the known mirnas; strikingly, the 3' ends showed stronger heterogeneity than the 5' ends. as exemplified by bmo-mir-263a, let-7a, and mir- <dig> in figure  <dig>  the highlighted isoform of mature sequences is more highly accumulated in the three libraries than is the previously annotated sequence, and should be regarded as the final functional molecule. similarly, over  <dig> known silkworm mirnas were refined based on sequencing reads . the mirbase annotations of silkworm mirnas may thus be improved based on the most frequently sequenced mirna isoforms. nevertheless, some annotated mirnas and highest reads were not derived from the same arms of the hairpin precursors, as illustrated by bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir- <dig> . accordingly, we postulate that these mirna precursors produce functional molecules on both arms in one or more cell types in the silk gland or other tissues of the silkworm. following identification by cloning  <cit> , bmo-mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> exhibit sequential degradation from the 5' to 3' ends, and low levels of the annotated mature sequences accumulate in the three libraries . actually, a small number of reads originating from the loop regions exist in our sequencing data, but they should be by-products of processing. well-established known mirnas tend to show high numbers of reads for the mir and mir* sequences, and very small numbers or no reads elsewhere. now, we find bmo-mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> suspicious with respect to being real mirnas when we see significant numbers of overlapping reads tiling a whole region.

in all,  <dig> conserved mirnas are closely clustered as polycistronic transcripts  . clusters 1- <dig> constitute conserved mirnas, whereas clusters 9- <dig> comprise conserved and silkworm-specific mirnas. all clustered mirnas have different total read counts in any one of the three libraries. for example, the read counts of bmo-mir- <dig> are almost 10-fold greater than those of bmo-mir- <dig> in the anterior-middle and posterior silk gland, but only two-fold greater relative to the whole body. the majority of clustered mirnas are derived from unique regions of the genome and, in general, are coordinately regulated. in cluster  <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig> is intergenic, whereas other members of the cluster are intronic. the read count of bmo-mir- <dig> is far lower than those of intronic mirnas in this cluster, and the mirnas are thus unlikely to be coordinately regulated. seven families of conserved mirnas, including four clusters described above , have paralogs in the silkworm genome  . significant differences were seen between the read counts of clustered paralog mirnas across the three libraries . in paralog  <dig>  both arms of bmo-mir- <dig> produced over a 10-fold greater number of mature molecules than did bmo-mir-993a and mir-993b. both mir- <dig> and mir-993b were confirmed in the three libraries, but mir-993a was absent in the posterior silk gland. the five members in paralog  <dig> or cluster  <dig> produced mirnas from the 3' arms and star sequences from the 5' arms. however, neither mirnas nor mirnas* were equally accumulated in each library, and the star sequences of bmo-mir-2a- <dig> abnormally outnumbered mirna sequences in the whole body. the read counts of bmo-mir-263a were at least 1000-fold higher than those of bmo-mir-263b in each library. the data collectively indicate that both paralogs and clusters are not prerequisites for the coordinate transcription and accumulation of mirna genes.

the mirna depot of bombyx mori is greatly enriched by newly identified mirnas
in total,  <dig> unique mirna and  <dig> star sequences were identified in this study . sequence comparisons between the silkworm candidates and mirnas of other organisms present in mirbase  revealed that  <dig> novel silkworm mirnas were orthologous to those identified in other species  whereas most unique mirnas displayed no evidence of evolutionary conservation, even within the insecta, and thus appeared to be silkworm-specific . the genome loci of all silkworm mirna genes were characterized, as presented in additional file  <dig> and figure 1b. we identified  <dig> mirna genes in the exons of protein-coding genes, including four conserved and eight silkworm-specific mirnas. four novel members, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir- <dig>  were located within the introns and exons of single protein-coding genes. in total,  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> conserved and  <dig> silkworm-specific members were intronic, whereas  <dig> mirna genes were widely distributed within intergenic regions  of the silkworm genome. in contrast to conserved and known mirnas,  <dig> silkworm-specific mirna genes were located in predicted transposable elements, and were repeat-associated . strikingly, these transposable elements are preferentially found outside protein-coding genes; only  <dig> of  <dig> unique transposable elements seem to be contained within predicted protein-coding genes. we identified  <dig> clusters consisting of  <dig> novel mirna and  <dig> annotated genes. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were located in the second exon of the protein-coding genes, bgibmga <dig> and bgibmga <dig>  respectively. clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were composed of intronic mirna genes. both clusters  <dig> and  <dig> consisted of intronic as well as intergenic mirnas , and are thus unlikely to be transcribed as polycistronic primary transcripts. clusters  <dig>   <dig>  13- <dig> and  <dig> were located in intergenic regions, whereas five clusters  were derived from predicted transposable elements. we identified  <dig> groups of paralogs,  <dig> consisting of  <dig> silkworm-specific mirna genes and  <dig> comprising  <dig> conserved mirnas . paralogous mirnas existed in  <dig> clusters, specifically,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  13- <dig> , 18- <dig> . these clusters possibly originated via a series of duplication and deletion events during silkworm evolution. the clustered paralogous mirnas may have overlapping functions in regulating a similar set of genes, as reported for the three clusters, mir-106b~ <dig>  mir-106a~ <dig>  and mir-17~ <dig> in mice  <cit> .

a number of evolutionarily conserved mirnas  were among the most abundant mirnas, as demonstrated previously  <cit> , whereas the majority of novel mirnas  were among the least abundant , consistent with the correlation between evolutionary conservation of mirnas and their expression levels  <cit> . however, some conserved mirnas displayed very low read counts; these included bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir- <dig>  some silkworm-specific mirnas  exhibited very high sequence reads, comparable to those of the abundant conserved mirnas . nevertheless, momentary and local read counts cannot represent transcriptional levels during the entire life-cycle of the silkworm. for example, we could not identify bmo-mir- <dig> in the present study, but this mirna was confirmed to be strongly expressed in the embryo and early larval stages of the silkworm  <cit> . only  <dig> silkworm-specific mirnas were common to the three libraries. in addition,  <dig> were shared by the whole body and the anterior-middle silk gland,  <dig> by the whole body and the posterior silk gland,  <dig> by the anterior-middle and posterior silk gland,  <dig> were in the whole body only,  <dig> were in the anterior-middle silk gland only, and  <dig> were identified only in the posterior silk gland . these data support the theory of several levels of complexity in mirna processing and regulation in response to specific physiological circumstances.

discussion
the present results provide experimental evidence supporting the authenticity of  <dig> unique mirna genes in the silkworm, including  <dig> novel and  <dig> known ones . analysis of the evolutionary conservation of all silkworm mirnas revealed that only  <dig> were widely conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates,  <dig> were limited to invertebrates, and  <dig> had homologs in other insects , whereas the majority of mirnas were specific to the silkworm. nearly  <dig> of the  <dig> newly identified chicken mirnas were also likely to be exclusively expressed in chicken lineages  <cit> . these data indicate that most of the newly identified mirnas are present in only a small group of organisms, and in some cases, in a single species  <cit> . species-specific mirnas may be large in number and evolutionarily dynamic as a result of gene duplication, sequence divergence and gene loss. a gray pawn hypothesis has been proposed for the species-specific chemoreceptor gene families in caenorhabditis species  <cit> ; this hypothesis suggests that individual genes are of little significance, but the aggregate activities of a large number of diverse genomic loci are required to establish a large phenotype space. the evolutionarily divergent mirnas may also contribute to establishing and maintaining phenotypic diversity between different groups of organisms  <cit> , and highly specific mirnas have a specialized function in particular organisms, possibly involving regulation of lineage-specific pathways  <cit> . furthermore, over 60% of the matched sequence tag fraction was attributed to unannotated small rnas. the substantial proportion of unclassified small rnas identified in this study may represent other classes of small regulatory rnas in the silkworm that have not been covered in our analyses. some of these may include rare mirnas represented by very low sequence reads, thus not passing our filtering criteria. these candidates should be explored in future studies applying the deep sequencing approach to developmental stages, tissues, or cells.

our sequence tag analysis led to the identification of mirna and mirna* sequences for  <dig> previously annotated mirna genes and unilateral sequence tags for  <dig> known mirna genes . the total reads of  <dig> mirstar sequences  were heavily skewed toward the rna hairpin arm containing annotated mirnas in at least one library . furthermore, we observed that bmo-mir-iab-4-5p levels exceeded those of bmo-mir-iab-4-3p in all three libraries , thus revealing strand bias, even for the twin mirnas. the reversal in the ratios of 5'- and 3'-derived sequence tags indicates preferential use of mature mirnas originating from different arms of pre-mirna precursors, and suggests additional levels of complexity in mirna processing, which remain incompletely understood  <cit> . these findings are evidently inconsistent with the current knowledge of mirna biogenesis and strand selection. the mirna* strand is probably degraded rapidly on exclusion from the rna-induced silencing complex , as the recovery rate of mirnas* from endogenous tissues is 100-fold lower than that of mirnas  <cit> . consequently, in many cases, mirna* cannot be detected using conventional methods, because of rapid turnover  <cit> . however, in the silkworm, a number of mirna genes  exhibited a similar number of sequence reads originating from the 5' and 3' arms of the mirna hairpin precursors  . the equivalent expression rates of mirna and mirna* largely result from similar 5' end stability that leads to equal incorporation of either strand into the risc and protection from degradation  <cit> . in some cases, sequence tags originate from the terminal loop region of the pre-mirna precursor . such examples have also been reported in other studies  <cit> , and are explained as genuine products of pre-mirna processing or random degradation products of unprocessed pre-mirna  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> pairs of sense/antisense mirnas in the silkworm . for example, bmo-mir- <dig>  -mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir-2799-as are the reverse complements of the bmo-mir- <dig>  -mir-9b, and bmo-mir- <dig> hairpins, respectively, and form hairpins reminiscent of mirna precursors . sequencing tags from small rna libraries of the anterior-middle and posterior silk glands mapped uniquely to the 5' arms of the bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-mir-2799-as hairpins. interestingly, the sense and antisense transcripts display highly similar sequences, and are paralogous mirnas . their mature sequences are derived from complementary palindromes of the precursors. both mirna and mirna* sequences were identified for bmo-mir- <dig> in the three libraries, but no sequencing reads mapped to the bmo-mir- <dig> hairpin, although this has previously been identified in the silkworm moth  <cit> , possibly indicating stage specificity. sense and antisense mirnas may coordinately control genes at their respective locations, as they both have target sites in the 3' untranslated regions  and 5' utrs of relevant genes . the host gene bgibmga006265-ta is significantly enriched in all examined tissues of fifth-instar day- <dig> larval silkworm  <cit> , and is optimally aligned to the thioredoxin domain of annotated homo sapiens disulfide isomerase  <cit>  that functions in protecting hypoxic cells from apoptosis  <cit> . another sense/antisense mirna pair, mir-79/mir-9b, also contains potential targeting sites for the untranslated regions of their home gene, bgibmga005856-ta, similar to the checkpoint kinase of mus musculus. however, previous studies suggest that mirnas do not target highly coexpressed genes  <cit> , and thus it needs to be urgently determined whether the potential sites are indeed authentic and how expression of the sense/antisense pairs and their host genes are coordinated in biogenesis. the bmo-mir-927/mir- <dig> pair is located in one intergenic region of the silkworm genome, but has target sites in the 3' utrs of unannotated genes proximal to their loci. significantly, the sense and antisense mirnas target each other . these mirnas may potently downregulate each other via transcriptional interference, or may interact post-transcriptionally, or function in vivo via a feedback pathway. however, the issue of whether the sense and antisense transcripts are processed in the same cell type remains to be established, since sense and antisense mirnas within an individual cell should interact. genomic arrangement of two mirnas arising from different strands of the same locus provides a simple and efficient means to create nonoverlapping mirna expression domains  <cit> . the whole body and the anterior-middle and posterior silk glands comprise more than two cell types; a particular pre-mirna may be processed into normal mature mirna in one type of cell and mirna* in another. while mirna and mirna* are equally processed, their functions may be distinct in the different cell types constituting this tissue. therefore, the sequencing reads in unique cell lines of the silkworm should aid in determining the significance of mirna, mirna,* and sense/antisense transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
we have sequenced mirnas in the whole body and silk gland of the silkworm. our data confirm the authenticity of  <dig> mirna genes in the silkworm, including  <dig> novel and  <dig> known mirnas. conservative analyses imply that mirnas act as phyla markers in evolutionary signaling. the silkworm-specific mirnas were significantly different between the anterior-middle and posterior silk glands. target predictions revealed that the sense/antisense mirnas target the 3' and 5' utrs of their host genes. identification of novel mirnas resulted in significant enrichment of the repertoire of insect mirnas and provided insights into mirna evolution, biogenesis, and expression in insects.
