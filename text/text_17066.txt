BACKGROUND
the excessive and often inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to a continuous increase and spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria, thus making it imperative to discover and carefully use new antibacterial substances  <cit> . bacteriocins are bacterial ribosomally synthesised proteinaceous substances with strong antibacterial activity, excellent structural stability, low immunogenicity, while resistance does not develop frequently  <cit> . one general mechanism of action of bacteriocins involves pore formation in target cells leading to the leakage of small molecules and cell death  <cit> . bacteriocins from gram positive bacteria can be grouped into three classes: class i which includes lantibiotics containing post-translationally modified amino acids such as lanthionine and dehydrated amino acids, class ii non-lantibiotics, containing only common amino acids and class iii containing bacteriocins with higher molecular mass   <cit> . lantibiotics  are divided into type a  and type b   <cit> . class ii is subdivided into three subclasses, namely, class iia , class iib  and class iic   <cit> . the biosynthesis of bacteriocins requires the translation of the prepeptide, post-translational modifications such as dehydration and cyclisation reactions to form the thioether bridges in lantibiotics and cleavage of the leader peptide during transport outside of the cell  <cit> . streptococcus mutans, a human indigenous oral bacterial species, is known to produce bacteriocins named mutacins  <cit> . it is believed that production of such mutacins may confer to s. mutans an advantage against competitive species living in the same niche  <cit> . to date, mutacins from class i and class ii have been purified and characterised: the mono-peptide lantibiotic , the di-peptide lantibiotic , the mono-peptide non-lantibiotic  and the di-peptide non-lantibiotic  . production of more than one mutacin by a given strain has been experimentally demonstrated for several strains and is also predicted by bioinformatic analysis of sequenced strain genomes  <cit> . mutacin-producing strains and some of their purified peptides have shown activity against gram positive and some gram negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . because of their biochemical diversity and activity spectra, many applications can be expected for mutacins as antibiotics or food preservatives  <cit> .

the main objective of our research is to further characterise mutacins to uncover new useful antibacterial substances active against bacterial pathogens. we previously classified  <dig> mutacin-producing strains into  <dig> groups  and subsequently seven clusters of activity were defined from the  <dig> type strains. this grouping was based only on their activity spectra towards other mutacinogenic strains and against various bacterial species including pathogens  <cit> . s. mutans  <dig>  and  <dig>  were clearly distinct in their activity spectra and the mutacins produced by these strains were not genetically related to the well known lantibiotics  nor to previously well characterised mutacins , j-t <dig> , h-29b) by using specific molecular probes  <cit> . we present here results on the production, purification and characterisation of mutacins f- <dig>  and d- <dig> .

RESULTS
mutacin f- <dig>  was produced in swp and the activity was measured as  <dig> au/ml while production of mutacin d- <dig>  was achieved in semi-solid medium by using tryptic soy with yeast extract containing agarose. activity of the crude mutacin d- <dig>  preparation was measured to be  <dig> au/ml.

mutacins d- <dig>  and f- <dig>  were purified by successive steps of hydrophobic chromatography. active fractions of mutacin f- <dig>  purification were recovered with an elution gradient of 50%-60% methanol in  <dig> mm hcl  and those of mutacin d- <dig>  with a 60%-70% gradient . the final specific activities were  <dig>  ×  <dig> au/mg for the purified mutacin f- <dig>  and of  <dig>  ×  <dig> au/mg for the purified mutacin d- <dig>  .

a total of  <dig> amino acids were sequenced for mutacin f- <dig>  and its identity with pediocin-like bacteriocins was confirmed by multiple alignment . the sequence revealed high levels of similarity to class iia bacteriocins with the presence of the five residues of the common consensus sequence -ygngv- and the two conserved cysteine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  the substitution of unidentified amino acids  in the mutacin f- <dig>  sequence with consensus amino acids found in our alignment  and those of others  <cit> , revealed that the following n-terminal sequence kyygngvtcgkhscsvdwskattni matches the molecular mass determined by maldi-tof ms analysis ). the isoelectric point of mutacin f- <dig>   and secondary structure prediction with this sequence correlate well with other class iia bacteriocins   <cit> .

the molecular mass for mutacin d- <dig>  was computed to be  <dig> da . however, sequencing of the mutacin d- <dig> proved to be problematic. edman degradation of native mutacin d- <dig>  was blocked after the first residue . the sequence of only the first  <dig> amino acids was clearly obtained after the derivatisation procedure, but with at least two peaks at each cycle.

the growth of m. luteus atcc  <dig> was inhibited immediately following the addition of a purified preparation of mutacin f- <dig>  at  <dig> au/ml as the viable count decreased rapidly and dropped to zero compared to the control. over an incubation period of  <dig> h, the viable count of the test culture remained unchanged, suggesting that mutacin f- <dig>  activity was bactericidal at the concentration tested .

the activity spectra observed for mutacins f- <dig>  and d- <dig>  show inhibition of a wide range of pathogenic bacteria including bacillus spp., enterococcus spp., listeria spp.,

staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. .

discussion
the inhibitory activity produced by the fermentation of s. mutans  <dig>  in swp did not come from release of pediocin already present in the whey proteins or permeate used to make the medium because no inhibitory activity in swp was detected from non-fermented nor purified medium against m. luteus atcc  <dig> and also because many other s. mutans strains were unable to produce an inhibitory activity by fermentation of the same medium  <cit> .

of all the current microbiological broth media commonly used for the growth of streptococcus sp., none permitted the production of a detectable level of mutacin activity by s. mutans  <dig> . activity of mutacin d- <dig>  was only detected after growth on solid medium. the production of some bacteriocins and mutacins is controlled by quorum sensing mechanisms which are better expressed when cells are grown at high density compared to lower cell density obtained in liquid culture  <cit> . for the isolation of mutacin d- <dig> , agarose was preferred over agar as agar may contain compounds interfering with accurate detection of mutacin activity  <cit> . the nature of these compounds is still unknown, but divalent anions such as sulfates are suspected. as seen in previous work with other mutacins, purification yields were low  and additional chromatographic steps will be necessary to improve yields and purity. the higher concentration of methanol used to recover mutacin d- <dig>  suggests that the peptide is more hydrophobic than mutacin f- <dig> . collected samples of pure mutacin d- <dig>  were very viscous because they probably retain part of the polymeric sugars from the agarose. however, with the methods used here, sufficient amounts of the substances were collected to carry out a preliminary characterisation of the peptides but the evaluation of their antibacterial spectrum was somewhat restricted.

the sequence of mutacin f- <dig>   was shorter than the generally recognised size for pediocin-like bacteriocins which is between  <dig> and  <dig> residues  <cit> . this may be due to peptidase activity of the strain. fifty three peptidases or peptidase homologues are found in the genome of s. mutans ua <dig> using the merops database  <cit> http://merops.sanger.ac.uk. the pediocin-like bacteriocin sequence could thus be a substrate in its 25th position for many of these peptidases. maldi-tof ms analysis revealed a major peak with an isotopic mass + of  <dig> da for mutacin f- <dig>  . this mass represents the lowest reported mass for an active naturally-produced pediocin-like bacteriocin after the study of bhunia et al.  <cit> . the length of mutacin f- <dig>  was sufficient to confer antimicrobial activity against several bacterial genera including bacillus spp., enterococcus spp., lactococcus spp., micrococcus spp., listeria spp., and streptococcus spp. . salvucci et al.  <cit>  reported activity of short peptides derived from the nh2-terminus of enterocin crl <dig> and other class iia bacteriocins, suggesting that the c-terminus of pediocin-like bacteriocins is not essential for their inhibitory activity. also, an active antimicrobial region in the nh2-terminus of this class of bacteriocin was identified by a bioinformatic approach  <cit> . the c-terminus section is known to confer specificity in the activity spectra of class iia bacteriocins and to interact with their cognate immunity proteins  <cit> . pediocin-like bacteriocins are unstructured in an aqueous solution and become structured when in contact with membrane-mimicking entities  <cit> . the electrostatic distribution along the molecule is highly polarized with most of the cationic residues concentrated in the n-terminal region. in the model class iia bacteriocin sakacin p, the n-terminal residues in positions 7- <dig>  and 15- <dig>  are predicted to form an anti-parallel β-sheet-like structure stabilised by a conserved disulfide bridge, followed by a hairpin-like structure that consists of an amphiphilic α-helix in position 18- <dig> . a second α-helix normally found in pediocin-like bacteriocins at position 29- <dig>  with the c-terminal tail  that folds back onto the central α-helix is absent in mutacin f- <dig> . a flexible hinge is found in position  <dig>  between the n-terminal β strands and the hairpin-like c-terminal region  <cit> . studies on the conformational changes of pediocin in an aqueous medium were conducted by gaussier et al.  <cit> . the authors concluded that the flexibility of the protein ensures its activity and that the aggregation of the c-terminus caused a loss of activity. lack of the c-terminus in mutacin f- <dig>  should prevent the formation of such aggregates and does not disrupt the activity of the molecule. the predicted secondary structure of mutacin f- <dig>  appears to differ slightly from that of pediocin pa- <dig>  an α-helix is formed between residues  <dig> to  <dig> and a turn is found at position 14- <dig> as compared to position 18- <dig> of pediocin pa- <dig>  the positions of the disulfide bridges were correctly predicted between positions c9-c <dig> for mutacin f- <dig>  and between positions c9-c <dig> and c24-c <dig> for pediocin pa- <dig> .

as for mutacin i, edman degradation of native mutacin d- <dig>  was blocked after the first residue , suggesting that the second residue  was dehydrated as dehydrated amino acids in lantibiotics were shown to block edman degradation  <cit> . following close inspection using the relative intensity of each peak as a reference and the fact that ethanethiol treatment broke mutacin i into two fragments according to qi et al.  <cit> , therefore creating two n-termini peptides in the mixture to be sequenced, we reasoned and found the following partial amino acid sequence for mutacin d- <dig> : f-sec-sec/dser-l-sec-l-sec-sec/dser-l--p-sec/dser-f-n-sec/dser-y-sec-sec. according to meyer et al.  <cit> , sec results from the conversion of a dha while a sec signal accompanied by a dser signal indicates residues involved in lan  formation, making the thioether bridge. based on these observations and by analogy to mutacin i, a more accurate, partial and truncated sequence with structural thioether bridges positions can be proposed for mature mutacin d- <dig> . the sequence of the two separate fragments obtained for the mutacin d- <dig>  is as follows:

nter-f-s-s-l-s-l-c-s-l--p-s-f-n-s-y-c-c

nter-f-dha-a-l-dha-l-a-a-l--p-a-f-n-a-y-a-a.

 residues are involved in lan formation. at this stage, an accurate thioether bridge pattern of mutacin d- <dig>  cannot be proposed unambiguously. the mass of mutacin d- <dig>  matched exactly that calculated for the lantibiotic mutacin i produced by s. mutans ch <dig> and ua <dig>   <cit> . this observation strengthens the apparent identity between mutacin d- <dig>  and mutacin i.

the activity spectra of purified mutacins f- <dig>  and d- <dig>  are in accordance with the antibacterial activity spectra of the respective producing strains inhibiting bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. using the deferred antagonism assay and thus observed for other purified pediocin-like bacteriocins and mutacins  <cit> . however, some of the strains tested, particularly listeria spp., were less sensitive to the activity of purified mutacin f- <dig>  than to the producer strain itself  <cit> . this may be due to the production by s. mutans  <dig>  of more than one mutacin in solid medium having activity against listeria spp.. also, resistance to pediocin-like bacteriocins in listeria species has already been reported and can be physiologically or genetically acquired  <cit> . low levels of resistance are caused by alterations in membrane lipid composition while high resistance levels involved the loss of a mannose permease component  <cit> .

nisin resistance is also reported and is related to membrane composition  <cit>  or alterations in the cell wall  <cit> . our results show that nisin-resistant listeria strains were still sensitive to the lantibiotic mutacin d- <dig> . lipid ii-targeted lantibiotics that are too short to form a pore across the bilayer membrane can still maintain their antibacterial activity to be able to kill the nisin-resistant strains in a similar manner, mutacin d- <dig>  could act by trapping lipid ii from the septum, blocking peptidoglycan synthesis and leading to cell death  <cit> . moreover, activity of mutacin d- <dig>  against antibiotic-resistant enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. stresses its potential as a new antibiotic. weak activity of mutacins f- <dig>  and d- <dig>  were observed against their respective producing strains  as compared to the highly sensitive strain m. luteus atcc  <dig>  which suggests that the respective strains are able to produce specific self-immunity factors. bacteriocin biosynthesis genes are generally co-transcribed with a gene encoding a cognate immunity protein ensuring protection of the producing cell against the lethal activity of the bacteriocin they produce  <cit> .

pediocin-like bacteriocins were identified in a wide variety of gram positive bacteria such as bacillus spp., carnobacterium spp., enterococcus spp., lactobacillus spp., leuconostoc spp., listeria spp.  <cit> . while high heterogeneity has been observed in the genetic determinants coding for production of mutacins  <cit> , this is the first report of a pediocin-like mutacin produced by s. mutans, which further extends the distribution of pediocin-encoding genes as well as the antibacterial spectra of s. mutans against pathogens sensitive to class iia bacteriocins. from the two genomes of s. mutans strains available in public databases   <cit> , no lantibiotic nor pediocin-like bacteriocin sequences were found, although many bacteriocin-related genes are detected  <cit> . only some entries with bacteriocin_ii superfamily proteins  in the ncbi database matched two pediocin family proteins from streptococcus bovis atcc  <dig> and streptococcus mitis atcc  <dig> . to our knowledge, only a streptococcus uberis strain was shown to produce a pediocin-like bacteriocin named ubericin a  <cit> . production of bacteriocins is widely distributed among strains of s. mutans. lantibiotic-type mutacin production is sporadically detected from strains isolated from different origins; this strongly suggests the existence of a common genomic ancestor element for lantibiotic biosynthesis  <cit> . comparative genomic analysis reported that dispensable genes exist and have been scattered through horizontal genetic transfer in various s. mutans strains. these optional mobile genes may be selected when they provide competitiveness to the strains as in the case of bacteriocin production to compete with the numerous other bacterial species resident in the oral cavity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
two bacteriocins from s. mutans have been isolated and characterised in terms of molecular mass, sequence and activity spectra. mutacin f- <dig>  is related to pediocin-like bacteriocins and is the first one shown to be produced by s. mutans. mutacin d- <dig>  appears identical to mutacin i in molecular mass and in the n-terminus sequence. antibacterial activity spectra of these mutacins indicate promising potential application by inhibiting numerous bacterial pathogens. more research remains to be done to increase the low yields of mutacin production and purification.
