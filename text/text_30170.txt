BACKGROUND
plants sense and respond to external stimuli using a repertoire of mechanisms that regulate gene expression for survival in hostile environments. to defend against external stimuli, plants have evolved inducible defense mechanisms against microbial pathogens and herbivores that involve the regulation of gene expression for the synthesis of specific proteins and secondary metabolites
 <cit> . signals that mediate systemic plant responses are classified as either slow or fast moving, travelling within minutes to several hours, and are typically mediated by different hormones/electrical signals
 <cit> . these fascinating phenomena imply the existence of cell-cell communication that transmits the defense response over a long distance
 <cit> . wounding responses in plants regulate multiple signaling pathways
 <cit> . it is well established in tomatoes and arabidopsis that ja is a systemic, long-distance, mobile- signaling molecule that functions by transmitting information about wounding to distant, non-wounded tissues where a defense response is invoked
 <cit> . moreover, jasmonates, which are synthesized from α-linolenic acid  via the octadecanoid pathway, induce the expression of a wide range of defense genes against mw, ha and necrotrophic pathogens
 <cit> . mutant and traditional grafting experiments support that the ja-signaling pathway creates long-distance mobile signals to activate defense gene expression
 <cit> . in addition, there is sufficient evidence that the kinetics of the ja and sa signaling pathways aid in choosing the defensive strategy following stress
 <cit> . cross-talk between phytohormones other than ja and sa, ethylene and aba  has not been extensively studied with respect to wounding signal perception . it has been well documented that signal transduction pathways often overlap and that the induced responses to various stimuli are different
 <cit> . for instance, insects chewing cause severe damage to leaf tissue and release volatile organic compound , which induce direct defense by activating wound signaling pathway
 <cit> . some of the oxylipin compounds  have the ability to be a master-switch against herbivores and turn on herbivore-related defense genes
 <cit> . moreover, saliva-derived compounds are brought to the wound site during ha. these saliva-derived compounds  were shown to induce an outburst of both ja and herbivore-induced volatile organic compound 
 <cit> . how the herbivore feeds on the plant tissue, either by sucking or chewing, will determine whether the signaling pathway is ja solely, or ja and sa, induced
 <cit> . the coevolution between plants and herbivores has generated a costly defensive trait, which is greatly dependent on the concentration and timing of the hormone 
 <cit> . extensive studies defining the global expression profiles upon the activation of wounding signaling pathways have been conducted using microarrays
 <cit>  and proteomic
 <cit> . the role of such signaling hormones, integrated in the decision-making of stress response, are played by a class of reactive oxygen species 
 <cit> . an example of ros as retrograde signaling from chloroplast to nucleus having sub-cellular and systemic functionality has been documented
 <cit> . however, these cells are equipped with an excellent antioxidant  defense mechanism to detoxify the harmful effects of ros
 <cit> . sweet potato  with its hexaploid complex genome  accounts for the fifth-largest tuber crop worldwide. unlike others, the cultivar tainong  <dig> has great potential to defend itself against herbivore and/or wounding stress. the versatility of sweet potato sporamin makes it a very attractive tuberous storage protein because of its strong trypsin inhibitory activity and multiple biological functions against various stresses
 <cit> .

in this article, we analyzed the first line of ros scavenging mechanisms by antioxidant enzymatic activity in leaves after mw and ha. we dissect the role phytohormones play in shaping the interaction between mw and ha in the regulation of sporamin expression. we report for the first time that the sweet potato leaf, damaged by mw and ha, utilizes different phytohormone signals to orchestrate the interactive role in the regulation of the sporamin gene. realizing the potential importance of these signals, we studied the regulatory mechanisms that attenuate two wound-induced transcription factors  by either ja or sa under the stress of mw and ha. furthermore, we performed a transcriptome analysis of wounding stress and surveyed global gene expression to identify the relevant genes of the phytohormone network. together, our findings illustrate the precise role of the phytohormone and signaling pathways that play critical roles in regulating sweet potato sporamin expression upon abiotic mechanical damage and biotic ha.

RESULTS
in vitro antioxidant scavenging enzymatic activities after mw or ha
initial attempts were made to learn how the different ros levels at the site of damage leads to increasing anti-oxidative enzymes and response to stress. damage caused by free radical-induced oxidative stress is repaired by antioxidant enzymes, which are important as they protect cells. we performed two different stresses, mw and ha, to estimate the total level of antioxidant enzymes. the time points were designed to identify the early  and late  responses of wounding stress in the sweet potato leaf. phenolics can directly scavenge molecular ros to eliminate free radicals, linearly correlated with antioxidant capacity. total phenolic content and  <dig>  1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl  assay was measured for control leaf , leaf damaged by mw and leaf damaged by ha. the total phenol content from mw leaves increases at  <dig>  h ,  <dig>  h , and 6 h  compared to that of ck leaves  . the increase in phenolic content in response to insect feeding   was likely not significant except for values 6 h time point . in addition, the sweet potato leaves showed a significant increase in dpph antioxidant level in response to mw and ha. using the ec <dig> value of ascorbic acid , the dpph antioxidant level was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 6 h, respectively, in response to mw . similarly, the dpph antioxidant level was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 6 h, respectively, in response to ha. collectively, a direct correlation between total phenolic content and dpph free radical scavenging activity was shown in response to mw and ha at all the time points tested. however, a significant reduction of the total phenolic content and dpph antioxidant level was observed upon ha as compared to mw.

antioxidant-catalyzing enzymes , catalase , peroxidase , and hydrogen peroxidase ): the superoxide dismutase  activity increased at all of the time points tested in response to mw and ha, compared to the control  . the mean enzymatic activity of sweet potato sod significantly increased at  <dig>  h  and 6 h  after mw . however, the enzymatic level at  <dig>  h  after mw was lower than that at  <dig>  and 6 h. similar enzymatic activity levels were observed at  <dig>  h  and 6 h  after ha, but in comparison with mw, ha resulted in lower sod activity . catalase assay: catalase  is an enzyme that reduces oxidative stress by removing h2o <dig>  our results showed that in response to mw, the activity of catalase decreased significantly over time;  <dig>  h  and 6 h  was lower than that at  <dig>  h  . in contrast, upon ha, the catalase enzyme activity was significantly reduced at  <dig>  h  but increased at  <dig>  h  . however, at 6 h , some activity remained in both the mw and ha leaves . overall, this data indicates a significant increase in catalase activity in mw and ha leaves compared with control leaves  . peroxidase activity assay : hydrogen peroxide production often results in an increase in peroxidase activity in response to stress. from our data, the peroxidase activity did not show any significant differences between the control leaves and the mw and ha leaves at the different time points . however, a notable increase in the basal level activity was observed in the mw leaves. in contrast, the ha leaves showed a slight decrease in peroxidase activity at all of the time points tested . hydrogen peroxidase activity assay : next, we used the tmb  assay to determine the hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, which revealed notable changes in this activity between control leaves and mw or ha leaves. the h2o <dig> scavenging activity at  <dig>  and  <dig>  h was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm upon mw, respectively, compared to the control  . however, the h2o <dig> scavenging activity gradually decreased in both the mw  and ha  leaves at 6 h . collectively, our results of total phenolic content , dpph antioxidant level , pod  and h2o <dig> assay  showed similar or identical total antioxidant level and activity upon mw and ha stresses. in contrast, sod  and cat  showed a significantly different pattern of total antioxidant level and activity upon mw and ha stresses.

in vivo fluorescence determination of the singlet oxygen species  levels in response to wounding stress
to assay the singlet oxygen  level at an early time point is essential because it is the primary signal to induce other ros species. here, we monitored wounded leaves  under the short illumination duration  and light intensity. the formation of 1o <dig> was measured by sosg dye . figure 
2a-h shows our confocal laser-scanning microscope  experiment of leaves from unwounded  and mw or ha leaves  that were infiltrated with sosg dye in the dark or light. substantial sosg fluorescence was only detected in mw or ha leaves treated with sosg in the dark and in the light compared to the ck leaf . the significant generation of 1o <dig> in sweet potato leaves damaged by mw or ha induces hydrogen peroxide and superoxide in the presence of light, suggesting the cross-talk role of 1o <dig> production during ros metabolism .

alteration of endogenous ja and sa levels in sweet potato leaves in response to mw or ha
from the changes of ros levels, we suspected that leaves damaged by mw or ha  eventually increase endogenous hormones for defense signaling. to address this point, a time-course analysis  was carried out to quantify the levels of endogenous ja and sa by lc-esi-ms in the third leaf of sweet potato plants damaged by mw or ha. in a healthy sweet potato leaf, the endogenous levels of ja and sa were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g fresh weight  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g fw, respectively . in the leaf damaged by mw, the level of endogenous ja began to increase at  <dig>  h and remained significantly higher than its initial level at  <dig>  h . this increase in the endogenous ja level was 2-fold higher than the control . in contrast, the level of endogenous sa began to increase slightly at  <dig>  h and was significantly reduced at  <dig>  h . at 6 h after mw, both endogenous ja and sa were detected at their basal levels . in contrast, upon ha, the level of endogenous ja positively correlated with mw at  <dig>  and  <dig>  h and at 6 h  . similarly, we noticed a significant and stable increase in the sa level beginning at  <dig>  h  and continuing to 6 h  after ha . thus, our results indicate that the levels of ja and sa are inversely correlated during mechanical damage and ha in sweet potato leaves. the reduction of sa and ja  could be explained by the variation between the samples tested.

nac and wrky were the dna-binding proteins that recognize swre element of sporamin promoter
a yeast one-hybrid screening system was performed to isolate a dna-binding protein that binds to three tandem repeats of the swre fragment , -1103- acatttctcgtaaatacgtacaatatccttgtctttcc -1061). a cdna library generated from wounded sweet potato leaves was expressed as a translational fusion with a gal <dig> activation domain  in a yeast reporter strain which carries an integrated his <dig> allele, with the three tandem copies of the swre sequence  employed as a probe . at the first screening using the library, which contains 6 × 105 cfu,  <dig> colonies were selected from the selective medium and were re-streaked on a more stringent selective medium. finally, two cdnas, named ibnac <dig>  and ibwrky <dig>  respectively, emerged within the swre fragment sequence. in order to confirm their binding ability with swre fragments, these two clones were transformed into a yeast cell containing the phis2-3xswre reporter vector or phis <dig> as a negative control again. as shown in figure 
4b, co-transformation of pgadt7-rec2-ibnac <dig> with phis2-3xswre or phis <dig> can both grow in the sd/-leu/-trp medium, as well as pgadt7-rec2-ibwrky <dig> with phis2-swre or phis <dig>  however in the sd/-his/-leu/-trp plus 100 mm 3-at selective medium, only co-transformation of pgadt7-rec2-ibnac <dig> or pgadt7-rec2-ibwrky <dig> with phis2-3xswre can grow but not phis <dig> reporter vectors only .

the regulation of sporamin is facilitated by transcription factors in response to wounding stress and hormonal treatment
to address whether the systemic expression of sporamin, ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> gene were activated by endogenous hormones ja and sa in response to wounding, we executed an experiment in which similar time points were analyzed. qrt-pcr was performed on sweet potato leaves treated subjected to mw and treated with the exogenous application of meja, sa or dieca. we reproducibly demonstrated that the expression of sporamin transcript is induced in leaves damaged by mw over the time course . similarly, the expression of ibnac <dig> was strongly induced at  <dig>  and  <dig>  h and at 6 h  after leaves damaged by mw.

on the other hand, the accumulation of the ibwrky <dig> transcript did not show any induction at all of the time points tested . thus, sporamin and ibnac <dig> were induced upon mw stress, suggesting the association of ibnac <dig> as a positive regulator and ibwrky <dig> as a negative regulator of sporamin gene expression upon mw stress.

next, we examined the expression level of the sporamin, ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> gene after the application of meja. using qrt-pcr, we confirmed that the sporamin and ibnac <dig> transcripts induced at  <dig>  and  <dig>  h after the exogenous application of meja, and their level noticeably declined from  <dig>  to 6 h . furthermore, ibwrky <dig> was not detected at the early time points  and showed a remarkably higher expression at 6 h after meja treatment . in plants, dieca is a potent inhibitor of ja- biosynthesis in the octadecanoid pathway
 <cit> . as expected, exogenous application of dieca was only effective against the expression of sporamin transcript at the early time points  <dig>  and  <dig>  tested, and had no effect at 6 h after treatment . however, exogenous application of dieca does not alter the ibnac <dig> gene expression . in contrast, ibwrky <dig> transcript had no expression at early time points, similar to the without-dieca treatment , but induced to express only at 6 h after dieca treatment . together, this can be easily explained by the fact that blocking of ja biosynthesis will automatically lower the signal transduction in the ja-signaling pathway; antagonistically, sa levels should be induced and sa-responsive genes should be up-regulated.

furthermore, upon treatment with sa, our qrt-pcr results shows that the low level or basal expression of sporamin was significant at all the time points tested . on the other hand, strong activation of ibnac <dig> gene expression was stable post-exogenous application of sa treatment at all the time points . thus, we hypothesize ibnac <dig> is a positive convergence regulator, activated upstream of sporamin that is influenced by both ja- and sa-mediated signaling in a time-dependent manner. moreover, the accumulation of ibwrky <dig> did not show any expression at early time points , but induced to express at 6 h after sa treatment . therefore, ibwrky <dig> has a partial role in both ja and sa signaling at later time points in the wound- signaling pathway.

effects of ha on the expression of sporamin and the transcription factors ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> in sweet potato leaves
to demonstrate that leaves damaged by ha have different responses to those with mw, second instar larvae  were placed on the underside of every third leaf of sweet potato plants and the leaves were observed for biotic damage. herbivore -eaten leaves were collected at three different time points , and the mass of the leaves consumed by the larvae was moderately reduced at 6 h after feeding began . we further observed the behavior and survival of the herbivores, and our results showed that the body color of the larvae changed from brown to brownish-green and the larvae moved from the upper side to the lower side of the leaves whenever perturbed. furthermore, the growth of the larvae was measured every 2 days for a period of 7 days. a few of the larvae died at various stages, leaving 6– <dig> individuals that survived to adults . their weight moderately increased, beginning at day  <dig> and continuing to increase until day  <dig> . the larvae produced wet fecula from the dorsal anus from day  <dig> to day  <dig> .

next, we examined the expression of sporamin, ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> in response to ha by qrt-pcr. we observed a similar pattern of sporamin and ibnac <dig> gene expression between mw  and ha . however, we did find a significant accumulation of ibwrky <dig> transcripts in leaves damaged by ha . in the ha leaf, the accumulation of ibwrky <dig> began at  <dig>  h, peaked at  <dig>  h and was maintained until 6 h . this differs from leaves with mw , in which the transcript levels of ibwrky <dig> transcription factor was inversely expressed. collectively, we concluded that endogenous ja plays a major role in the activation of sporamin gene expression upon two different stresses  mediated by ibnac <dig>  however, the differentiated responses of ibwrky through s. littoralis-specific oral secretion created a cross-talk interaction of ja and sa signaling pathways.

solexa sequencing: global expression profiling of the sweet potato response to mw
digital gene expression library sequencing
in this study, we conducted solexa sequencing from sweet potato leaf  with mw  and control without wounding . a total  <dig> , <dig> million raw reads were produced by using the llumina solexa genome analyzer  ii sequencing platform, with total nucleotides  <dig>   <dig> , <dig> . the mean read length, contig length and gc % were  <dig> , 519 bp and  <dig> % for control and  <dig> , 493 bp and  <dig>  for wounding library. distribution of total clean reads and its coverage are shown . after quality trimming, the removal of primers, adaptor, poly  sequences, and low quality reads, we obtained a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from mw and ck libraries, respectively . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from the wounding and control libraries . a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts were identified from control and wounding libraries. we have analyzed the most differentially regulated transcripts with a log2ratio > <dig> or < - <dig> as a threshold by means of significant value  as well as false discovery rates , representing  <dig>  differentially expressed  transcripts  . the major go  terms corresponding to the differentially expressed transcripts are shown in figure 
 <dig>  a large number of transcripts were associated with ‘response to stimulus’, ‘signaling’, ‘hormone response’, ‘metabolic’ and ‘cellular process’. among the differentially expressed genes , we observed that a large number of transcripts were associated with responses to stimulus such as allene oxide synthase , alternative oxidase , sensitive to proton rhizotoxicity , sen <dig>  salt tolerance zinc finger , non-race specific disease resistance  and nucleosome assemble protein- related protein nrp <dig>  including sporamin , ipomoein , etc. furthermore, we noticed that the several transcription factors, such as arabidopsis transcription activator factor , wrky, arabidopsis response regulator , ethylene responsive factor , myc etc., overlap in the subcategory of ‘response to stimulus’.

enriched pathway analysis of degs
in this study, the degs were mapped to a total of  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways with q value of < <dig>  . the  <dig> most enriched pathways were involved in ‘phenylalanine metabolism’, ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’, ‘nitrogen metabolism’, ‘plant-hormone signal transduction’, ‘amino sugar nucleotide sugar metabolism’, ‘plant-pathogen interaction’, ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’, ‘alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism’ and ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’. altogether, these results shed light on the wounding response in the sweet potato leaf, which is overwhelmed by dynamic metabolism as well as actively adapting to the hostile environment .

gene enrichment analysis
next, go term enrichment was analyzed using bingo software . we next screened and compared the degs against the arabidopsis genome database. of the  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts,  <dig>  transcripts were matched to the arabidopsis genome with an e-value 10- <dig>  of these  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts,  <dig> genes were found to have putative biological functions . these  <dig> genes were assigned to various functional role categories based on their significant matches to proteins that were already assigned a functional role. their expression patterns were separated into six major clusters based on their gene enrichment values. transcripts from each cluster are presented in the additional file
5: figures s <dig> and additional file
6: figure s <dig> 

quantitative real-time pcr  confirming accuracy of solexa sequencing
the expression of all  <dig> degs was consistent with the predictions based on the illumina sequencing results. among them, nine genes  were up-regulated and six genes  family protein; and efe and gamma-vpe) were down- regulated . actin <dig> was chosen as the reference gene for normalization data. in most cases, the expression values were a little higher than those obtained from the illumina sequencing .

early wounding-responsive genes that act in the first line of the wounding signaling cascade as assessed by qrt-pcr
based on our computational analysis, we have selected genes related to the plant-pathogen interaction pathway and plant-hormone signal transduction, and we discovered  <dig> differentially expressed, early wounding-responsive genes which may act in the first line of the wounding signaling cascade, including cyclic nucleotide- gated ion channel , calmodulin , ja-induced wrky, myc <dig>  myc <dig>  jaz <dig>  jaz <dig>  jaz <dig>  non-expressor of pathogenesis related , and tga. we compared the time-dependent changes in the expression of these genes with qrt-pcr . the results showed that jaz1/tify 10b, jaz2/tify 10a, myc <dig> and myc <dig> were significantly up-regulated at early time points and these up-regulated genes were associated with wounding or the ja- mediated signaling pathway. therefore, the induced expression of jaz1/tify 10b, jaz2/tify 10a, myc <dig> and myc <dig> confirms that the first line of the signaling cascade requires ja signaling in the control of the defense response.

on the other hand, the down-regulation of cngc and cam in response to wounding suggests their roles as negative regulators of defense gene expression in the wounding response. it is possible that ca2+/cam control downstream defense genes in the wounding signaling pathway. in addition, we examined npr <dig> and tga, which were down-regulated in response to wounding, which suggests the npr1- and sa-dependent stimulus pathway .

discussion
to minimize the damage caused by either mw or ha, plants produce antioxidant and ros scavenging enzymes
 <cit> . different patterns of ros and antioxidant mechanisms exist between mw and ha in the sweet potato leaf . this study supports the notion that two different stresses  generate ros in the plant cells. during this process, production of 1o <dig> initiates lipid peroxidation to disrupt psii as a result of plasma membrane nadph oxidase 
 <cit> . the enhanced activity of sod in response to mw constitutes the primary defense that efficiently protects membrane lipids against oxidative damage
 <cit> . in parallel, mw reduced cat activity that can be explained by its interaction with sa, and induced the role in plant-pathogen defense mechanism
 <cit> . however, the increase in cat activity upon ha may prevent excess h2o <dig> production, which is responsible for membrane lipid peroxidation
 <cit> . increasing evidence of differential activation of these antioxidant enzymes was solely dependent upon growth and development
 <cit> .

sweet potato has differentially and chronologically expressed antioxidant enzymes when under mw and ha stress. the antioxidant system protection against wounding stress depends on growth stages. sod acts as a primary defense signal for mw at all time points tested. conversely, cat and pod followed a two-step activation upon mw and ha. at an early time point, cat was deactivated upon mw stress. in this instance, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide acts as a signal to induce octadecanoid signaling transduction pathway. in contrast, cat is activated after prolonged stress caused by ha, and leads to a decomposition of excess h2o <dig> at an early time point. at the later time point, both cat and pod are deactivated. accumulated h2o <dig> acts as a signal to induce octadecanoid and other defense signal transduction pathways 
 <cit> . furthermore, our study presented evidence that a specific level of ja and sa production induces the expression of defense-related genes that are involved in the antioxidant and detoxification processes 
 <cit> .

systemin and ja-mediated signal in sweet potato leaf after mw and ha
we investigated the critical role of phytohormones in orchestrating sporamin gene expression in response to mw and ha. the key observation underlying the experiments described is that endogenous ja level was enhanced after mw on the leaf to mediate the signal transduction and trigger the activation of the octadecanoid pathway  during early wounding time points 
 <cit> . however, upon ha, the enhanced endogenous sa level could be due to larval oral secretion , which interacts with endogenous phytohormones to elicit the sa burst and attenuates ja 
 <cit> . in agreement with previous studies of sporamin induction after mw or ha 
 <cit> , our report presented evidence that the sporamin is wound-inducible and activated through a systemin-mediated ja-signaling pathway
 <cit> . although ja is necessary for sporamin expression in both mw and ha, while sa was shown to be antagonistic to sporamin expression in sweet potato . these differences in cross-talk were consistent with previous reports of mw and ha in leaves, as they are solely dependent on timing, concentration of endogenous signal, and the regulation of defense gene expression.
 <cit> .

wounding signal transduction is mediated by two transcription factors to regulate sporamin gene expression differentially
many wound-responsive promoters in plant species have been functionally characterized, and several putative wound-responsive cis-elements have been identified such as g-box <cit> , gcc box <cit> , ag-motif <cit> , jasmonate/elicitor responsive element <cit> , 13-bp/l-box <cit> , w-box,
 <cit>  and sporamin <cit> . in the present work, we describe the isolation and characterization of two novel transcription factors that bind within the 38-bp -1103- acatttctcgtaaatacgtacaatatccttgtctttcc -1061- of the swre region of the sporamin promoter of the sweet potato . furthermore, we identified signal cross-talk between ja and sa signaling pathways that were mediated by ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> differentially . it appears that minor variations in the core sequences of sporamin promoter impart responsiveness to these different stimuli. upon mw, ibnac <dig>  acting as an early transcriptional factor, functions in the ja signal pathway to regulate sporamin gene induction in the sweet potato leaf 
 <cit> . however, ibnac <dig> may partially function in the sa pathway, which harmonizes the action of other downstream defense genes  
 <cit> . similarly, induction of ibnac1expression upon ha explains its role as a convergence transcriptional activator, functioning in both ja and sa signaling pathways to regulate sporamin gene expression in the sweet potato leaf 
 <cit> . in our study, we were puzzled to find that ibwrky is not a positive regulator for sporamin gene expression in mw or sa signaling . however, the meja/sa -mediated inhibition of ibwrky expression at an early time point suggested that endogenous ja level might play an important role in controlling its expression . moreover, the expression of ibwrky <dig> after 6 h upon exogenous meja or sa treatment  was a consequence of re-methylation of ja for a positive feedback effect on sa biosynthesis
 <cit> . this can be tested by quantifying the individual metabolites of ja and sa biosynthesis, and remains to be elucidated.

interestingly, the strongly up-regulated expression of ibwrky <dig> following ha  suggested, in this instance, at least two steps of regulation were imposed: firstly, an early response of ibwrky, possibly under the control of s. littoralis-specific oral secretion that elicits sa burst. this holds true because the feeding by s. littoralis caused more of a marked increase of endogenous sa than the endogenous ja concentration . secondly, the impact of leaves continuously damaged by s. littorais, different from ‘single’ wounding events, accumulates ibwrky <dig> expression possibly by facs, through which ja level was maintained
 <cit> . in light of this consideration, ibwrky <dig> played a direct role in the defense against herbivore and, indirectly, maintained ja level for sporamin- activated defense.

to make a comparison for the cross-talk differences between the two transcription factors ibnac and ibwrky in ja and sa signaling, we inferred from the publication and evidence by li et al.  that the inactivated wrky <dig> upon ja signaling to the promoter region of ja- responsive gene was likely controlled by cytosolic npr1protein. needless to say, ibwrky could be analogous to wrky <dig> as they reflect a similar cellular sa and ja balance. therefore, the fate of ibwrky regulates the sporamin gene expression via integrating sa and ja-signaling events, depending upon the stress. in support of this assumption, ibwrky and wrky <dig>  an uncommon member of the wrky transcription factor, are pivotal integrators of the sa and ja signals to regulate plant defense responses.

in contrast, our ibnac is strictly responsive to both wounding stresses  involved in both ja- and sa- signaling pathways, which suggests it is a positive transcriptional activator for regulating sporamin gene expression and partially other downstream genes . upon prolonged ha feeding, npr <dig> is not analogous to ibnac but acts as an amplification loop for ibwrky and pr gene expression through the sa-mediated independent pathway to defend against additional entry of pathogen signal
 <cit> . in conclusion, our results support the need for future work on investigating the mutants of ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> and their respective roles.

global gene expression profiles in sweet potato response to mw stress
based on the previous literature, mw stress often overlapped with multiple stress responsive genes and shared between different plant species
 <cit> . the sweet potato is a non-model organism that has not been extensively studied. among the contig annotated, we found the majority of degs involved in the ‘response to stimulus’ and ‘response to stress’ were related to pathogen, wounding, and abiotic and biotic stresses . based on the kegg pathway , we found that the majority of metabolic pathways genes were enriched and are common for sweet potato, suggesting they are involved in cell wall biosynthesis, inter-conversion of nucleotide sugars, biosynthesis of lignin and other cell-wall-bound phenolic compounds at the site of leaf damage caused by mw
 <cit> . on this basis, we integrated the results from this study and other published studies and formed a working model for the activation of sporamin gene expression and its regulation in response to external stimuli . mw or ha activates ja production, which in turn independently activates the expression of ibnac and sporamin through a ja-mediated signaling pathway. once the ja signal reaches its threshold level, genes encoding ja biosynthetic enzymes, which are tightly regulated by ja-responsive transcription factors , are up- or down-regulated. the activation of ibnac <dig> binds to the swre and induces transcription of the sporamin gene during early response of wounding stress. the negative cross-talk role of ibwrky <dig> specifically functions in sa- signaling and has an indirect role in ja- signaling pathway for the persisting expression of sporamin.

in contrast, ha results in an increased biosynthesis of both sa- and ja- signaling and leads to the subsequent activation of parallel signaling pathways. in this context, both ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> coordinate with each other and bind to the swre to activate the expression of the sporamin gene for defense. under prolonged ha, ibwrky <dig> possibly interacts with facs, which is necessary for maintaining the early action of de novo ja biosynthesis in the leaves. therefore, ibwrky <dig> is involved in both pathways upon ha, and requires the initial signal strength  for the mutual antagonistic interaction of the sa- and ja-mediated signaling to regulate sporamin gene expression for defense.

furthermore, the selected genes involved in the first line of wounding signaling cascade support the partial cross-talk between ja- and sa-mediated signal pathways in the regulation of sporamin gene expression. for correlation, the sporamin promoter region also has a g-box-like element and gc-core-like element, indicating that there is room to directly target myc/jaz interactions. similarly, the binding site of w-box for ibwrky <dig> was controlled by calmodulin through other tfs  of downstream defense genes. thus, the wounding-induced expression of sweet potato sporamin differs between mw and ha due to the cis-elements of the sporamin promoter. however, this is regulated by ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> and depends on the ja and sa pathways 
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
two mechanisms induced by wounding were clarified in this work: differentially activated by abiotic mw or biotic ha. our findings illustrate that both of them have an impact on different ros levels and antioxidant mechanisms, which indicates that signal components are different. the results showed that the two wound–induced signals, mw or ha, can change the endogenous level of ja or sa to regulate sporamin. mw was shown to be ja-mediated, signaling to regulate the transcription factor ibnac for the activation of sporamin gene expression. on the other hand, ha was shown to be both ja- and sa-mediated, signaling to regulate transcription factors of both ibnac <dig> and ibwrky <dig> for the activation of sporamin against herbivores. this antagonistic difference was further confirmed through the analysis of genes identified in the transcriptome in the context of mw stress. the selected genes involved in the first line of signaling cascade supports further the partial cross-talk between ja- and sa-mediated signal pathways in regulation of sporamin gene expression. the knowledge gained from this study holds great potential for sporamin research within the wounding signaling pathway in the near future.
