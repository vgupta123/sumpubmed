BACKGROUND
influenza a has evolved toward host specific mechanisms of infection leading to genetic divergence between human and avian strains. sequence divergence is so striking that single nucleotide counts are sufficient for classifying the host type for most influenza strains when analyzing whole segment or whole genome data  <cit> . a notable exception is the h5n <dig> avian strain that crosses the species barrier and can lead to deadly human infection. the h <dig> surface protein, hemagglutinin , in some cases is able to recognize human cell receptors  <cit>  along with mutations that allow the virus to better survive in the upper respiratory tract  <cit> . to date, however, there are relatively low numbers of human h5n <dig> infections compared to the more human persistent subtypes, which may be in part due to inefficient human to human transmission  <cit> . in this study the influenza viruses from the pandemics of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with elements of avian  strains mixed with genetic elements persistent in humans  <cit>  are used to provide a historic map of enduring genetic features from past pandemics and their circulation in current human, avian and swine strains  <cit> .

whole influenza genomes were searched for genetic markers conserved in pandemic strains that are associated with two features of infection: host specificity and high mortality rate. for host specificity a search was designed to find amino acid mutations in human influenza strains that were not observed in avian strains. the approach for defining host specificity markers closely followed the work of  <cit>  which predicted positions in the genome associated with human host specificity. other recent work  <cit>  looked more broadly for human markers beyond the pandemic conserved regions. both of these studies examined amino acid point mutations using differing measures for functional significance. in this study a new approach was developed to look for combinations of mutations in the genome that identify host specific evolutionary pressures beyond single point mutations. new mutations were identified that exhibit a co-variation mutation pattern. evaluating mutation combinations allowed for the analysis of genetic markers where single point mutations failed to distinguish high and low mortality rate strains. in total  <dig> host specific and high mortality rate pandemic conserved markers were found. the ultimate goal of our study was to examine how the  <dig> pandemic conserved markers might re-emerge in a future single strain. while marker re-emergence in a single strain does not predict pandemic potential, their presence could highlight unexpected evolutionary events in circulating strains that warrant closer scrutiny.

influenza genomes not used in the marker estimation process were searched for the presence or absence of the markers. the human host specific markers were sought in the recent avian strains infecting human , the high mortality rate associated markers were sought in the avian strains and both marker sets were sought in non-avian non-human strains . the high mortality rate markers appeared in a wide variety of avian strains but the recent avian to human strain crossovers lacked most of the human strain specific markers. human persistent strains retained human specific markers  but lacked most of the high mortality rate markers. swine strains fell in the middle, carrying both high mortality rate and host specificity markers but with no single strain containing all  <dig> markers. using a maximum parsimony principle, likely evolutionary pathways for the re-emergence of the  <dig> markers in a single strain were considered with a computational experiment. the fewest evolutionary events through reassortment and mutation needed for a single influenza strain to acquire all  <dig> markers in the presence of a second strain were counted. starting with a small number of sequenced h1n <dig> human and swine strains, a mix with avian strains were found to acquire the  <dig> pandemic markers through a combination of  <dig> or fewer segment reassortment and amino acid mutation events.

RESULTS
the genetic marker identification procedure uses a discriminative classifier  with cross validation to build two models, one for host specificity and one for high mortality rate strains. the discriminative classifier is a computational tool that is designed to classify an unknown sample as belonging to one of two classes. here one classifier model is designed to classify the influenza host type, the second model is designed to classify the influenza mortality rate type. each model takes as input the  <dig> influenza proteins aligned and concatenated and classifies the strain in the case of host specificity as being human or avian. for mortality rate, input strains are divided into high and low mortality rate strain classes. the purpose for building the classifier is to find the positions in the influenza genome that are important in the model for accurately classifying input strains, a problem commonly referred to as the feature selection problem  <cit> . candidate markers are found by building new classifiers that take as input a small subset of the influenza proteome. the input sets that lead to classifiers that match the accuracy of the original classifier  highlight the amino acid markers that are important for class discrimination. an iterative procedure is used. for the initial step all single amino acid positions are found that separate the two classes . the iterative step n identifies the n sized  combinations that separate the data such that each combination does not contain a smaller sized combination that separates the two classes equally well. this procedure yields a set of non-redundant mutation patterns that separate the two classes. the iterative procedure is important so that a candidate marker is only included as part of a distinguishing pattern when it adds to the classification accuracy. so for example if position  <dig> in the pb <dig> protein distinguishes avian and human strains, then position  <dig> would not be included as part of another set of features . only markers that contribute significantly to classification accuracy are included in the final result. details on selecting candidate functional markers are given in the methods section.

host specificity markers
sixteen positions in the influenza genome were found to be associated with human host specificity. the markers were found on the non-structural protein  <dig> , non-structural protein  <dig> , matrix protein  <dig> , nucleoprotein , acidic protein  and the basic polymerase  <dig>  protein. each strain was assigned a genotype, which showed whether the human consensus amino acid variant was present at each of the  <dig> positions. strains excluded from the marker estimation process, human infections of avian origin  <cit>  and non-human non-avian strains, were checked for evidence of an enrichment of human specificity markers relative to the remaining avian strains. with one exception the human infections of avian origin showed a genotype that was distinct from the most common avian genotype background but the number of accumulated human markers was small.

the columns are grouped so that avian to human crossover genotypes are clustered into three groups labeled at the top of figure  <dig> as: h <dig> , h5n <dig> beginning in  <dig>   <cit>  and the h5n1/h9n <dig> hong kong outbreaks from 1997â€“ <dig>   <cit> . additional similar genotype patterns are placed in adjacent columns. a pattern emerges from the two most common avian genotypes ranked  <dig> and  <dig> in figure  <dig>  these two genotypes cover 60% of the sequenced strains and span nearly all of the subtypes including h5n <dig>  h9n <dig>  h7n <dig> and h7n <dig>  among the lethal avian to human crossovers there are two genotypes that arise in humans that are not found in sequenced avian strains . these cases could be examples of post infection mutations, or alternatively show the limits in the coverage of sequenced avian strains.

high mortality rate markers
in a second experiment human influenza strains were separated into two groups: a high mortality rate group containing pandemic genomes selected from the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks, human h5n <dig> and the h1n <dig>  <dig> deadly new jersey infection and a low mortality rate group containing all other whole genome human infection samples. as with the pandemic conserved host type markers, the high mortality rate markers were required to be positively identified in each of the sequenced strains associated with the three pandemic outbreaks . eighteen of  <dig>  sequenced human influenza genomes  not in the high mortality rate class contained all  <dig> of the identified high mortality rate markers. these cases occurred in h2n <dig> and h3n <dig> strains from the 1960s and 1970s in years following their respective pandemics.

the most common non-human non-avian genotype  is a swine h1n <dig>  which shares many of the high mortality rate variants but misses the mutations found on the ns and pb <dig> segments. the second most common subtype shares all but one of the high mortality rate variants and is circulating in horse  but figure  <dig> shows that h3n <dig> lacks most of the human host type markers . the complete high mortality rate variant  are h5n <dig> cases that infect a broad host range including swine, tiger, domestic cat, civet, and stone marten. figure  <dig> shows that these strains  contain only a small number of human specific markers similar to the h5n <dig> human infections. the differences in genotypes show that swine host both strains found with human transmission markers or strains enriched with the high mortality rate markers. this could present an opportunity for two strains to mix and evolve into a swine strain with all  <dig> of the predicted pandemic conserved markers.

recent work mixing avian h5n <dig> with human h3n <dig> in ferret models has shown that combining the h5n <dig> cell surface proteins with the internal human proteins need not lead directly to efficient ferret to ferret transmission, which serves as a model for human to human transmission  <cit> . in this approach only reassortment events were considered, highlighting the complexity that may be involved in acquiring the precise mix of genetic elements required for an h5n <dig> virus to acquire pandemic potential.

to explore the steps needed to acquire the  <dig> genetic markers, hypothetical strain mixes were examined where pairs of genotypes sampled within one year difference were tested to simulate concurrent circulating strains. two evolutionary events were considered: reassortment between segments counted as a single evolutionary event and an amino acid point mutation, also counted as a single evolutionary event. each genotype was checked for the minimal number of events needed to acquire all  <dig> markers when mixed with a second strain. for completeness, all  <dig> pairwise combinations for the three host types were considered: human, avian and non-human non-avian. there were  <dig> distinct genotypes with  <dig>  pairwise combinations and  <dig> distinct combinations of events that led to the  <dig> markers in a new strain. it is important to note that strain mixes that include a human strain already have the  <dig> human conserved markers and only lack the complement of high mortality rate conserved markers. thus, human strains should require fewer mutation and reassortment events to acquire the  <dig> markers, compared to strain combinations between non-human influenza strains. figure  <dig> shows the frequency distribution  for the fewest events needed for each of the  <dig> genotypes to acquire the  <dig> markers. the percentage of the blue bar covered by red is the relative contribution of reassortment events to the total. for example, in the case of  <dig> events, on average roughly half the events are attributed to reassortment. the histogram shows that on average the fewest events to acquire the  <dig> markers is almost always through a combination of reassortment and mutation. the figure points to two cases that are one mutation away from the  <dig> markers, a human h2n <dig> strain from  <dig> and a h3n <dig> strain from  <dig>  these are examples of strains conserved from their respective recent pandemic ancestors and their presence  indicate that the  <dig> markers are not sufficient for causing pandemic potential.

potentially novel strains with avian subtypes found to infect humans, which could circumvent existing human immunity , were examined more closely. sixty-six distinct event combinations were found, but only a few cases required  <dig> events or less, which are summarized in table  <dig>  these potential paths involve  <dig> distinct genotypes from human and swine h1n <dig> strains, which acquire the two avian surface proteins plus one or two additional amino acid mutations on the ns <dig>  pb <dig> or pb <dig> gene. three of the  <dig> genotypes were observed in  <dig> or later. the first sequenced strain from each location is given in table  <dig>  although all of the human strains maintain all  <dig> human markers, they differ in the number of  <dig> high mortality rate markers present. thus, different human strains require different numbers of mutations to acquire the  <dig> markers. for example, when starting with human h3n <dig> strains,  <dig> or more high mortality rate mutations are required in addition to the double reassortment with the ha and na genes.

first column shows the initial strain, the second column shows region where strain is found, the third column shows double reassortments taken  and column four shows the mutations  taken. the human case  involves three subtypes  and one or two mutations.

 the four columns are year sample was taken , location of the sample , the sample name  and genbank accession . *h1n <dig> swine sample, all other samples are human h1n <dig> strains.

CONCLUSIONS
a distinct genotype subset emerges from the avian background from which the human crossovers are derived with some strains adopting a limited number of human persistent markers. overall, the human infections of avian origin have acquired no more than a few human specific markers, which suggests that avian strains are not rapidly acquiring human persistent markers through genetic drift. the high mortality rate markers are ubiquitous in the avian background and are distinct from the vast majority of human infections. while the host type markers clearly separate avian and human strains, there are a number of cases where descendants of the  <dig> and  <dig> pandemics continued to retain all of the predicted high mortality rate markers. finding that classification accuracy for high mortality rate strains is lower than the host type classification weakens support for the notion of a single essential common set of high mortality rate markers. the reduced classification accuracy comes primarily from the fact that the h2n <dig> sequences continue to maintain the  <dig> markers into the 1960s, well past the associated pandemic. thus, these  <dig> markers do not clearly distinguish between pandemic and non-pandemic associated h2n <dig> strains. instead the results support the hypothesis that additional factors play an important role in determining the mortality rates of a specific strain. this highlights the potential importance to pandemic potential of host immunity and antigenic novelty. even in the case of host type markers where classification accuracy is very high, markers could be missed. for example, the ha and na genes play a critical role in host specific infection, but this study focused specifically on the persistent markers, and host specificity markers were found only on the more heavily conserved internal proteins. additional potentially important host type markers that are not persistent should still exist.

it is worth noting that  <dig> of the  <dig> high mortality rate markers lie on the na or pb <dig> segments implying that they were independently introduced into the three respective pandemic outbreaks  <cit> . aside from the  <dig> high mortality rate markers persisting in h2n <dig> strains past the  <dig> pandemic time frame, the markers give an overall high degree of classification accuracy and, therefore, a potentially useful common, although not sufficient, set of associated genetic factors. among the high mortality rate strains not associated with a pandemic, only the  <dig> h1n <dig> isolate lacks all  <dig> markers . because the  <dig> sample is a small contributor to the total number of high mortality rate features, it does not significantly contribute to the classification model. substituting a single alternate  <dig> swine strain for example, would have limited impact on the markers chosen unless more strains were added or a single strain was given the same weight as the pandemic strains in which perfect conservation is required. in this case mixing low mortality rate strains into the high mortality rate class would substantially alter the reported set of persistent markers. requiring perfect conservation with the  <dig> h1n <dig> strain would reduce the number of candidate markers to  <dig> . similarly, swapping in nearly any other h3n <dig> sequence from the low mortality rate class, including those from the 1970s would alter the candidate marker set due to a lack of conservation.

evolutionary pathways through reassortment and mutation show that strain combinations starting with h1n <dig> human and swine need the fewest events to acquire the pandemic conserved markers. several of these pathways would lead to novel strains with h5n <dig> subtypes that could challenge human immunity. the potential need for an extended time or number of exposures for strains to acquire the human persistent mutations combined with the high mortality rate markers associated with avian strains suggests how swine could act as a mixing vessel where both human specific and high mortality rate markers are found to persist. additional work may reveal restrictions that limit the strain combinations that lead to viable new strains. measuring the rate of co-infection in swine and human, particularly in cases where an avian like strain is suspected to be present, could provide additional data for more precisely modeling the likelihood of the reassortment events that combine with mutations to facilitate mutation combinations important to infection.
