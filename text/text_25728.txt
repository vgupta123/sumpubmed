BACKGROUND
intestinal microbiota consists of approximately  <dig> bacteria that can be classified into more than  <dig> species  <cit> . intestinal microbiota clearly impact mucosal immune responses in infants  <cit> , yet our understanding of how enteric immunity is modulated by gut microbes is limited because of difficulties in performing such studies in humans, especially in infants due to ethical reasons. germ-free pigs transplanted with human gut microbiota  provide a model system that is ideal for the study of the manifold effects of human microbiota on health and disease  <cit> . human gastrointestinal tract  can be colonized at birth by facultative anaerobes including enterobacter, lactobacillus and streptococcus in genus level, forming a reducing environment during the first week of life enabling colonization by strict anaerobes such as bacteroides, clostridium, bifidobacterium in genus level  <cit> . this microbial colonization contributes to recruitment of immune cells to the gastrointestinal tract and is a major contributor to the development of the mucosal and systemic immune systems in neonates  <cit> . colonization in early infancy is crucial in relation to the final composition of the permanent microbiota in adults and also in inducing immunological maturation in the intestine and shaping future immune responses of the host  <cit> .

many previous studies have demonstrated that probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg  strain has beneficial effects on intestinal function, including stimulating development and mucosal immunity, maintaining and improving intestinal barrier function, and prolonging remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis  <cit> . studies have also demonstrated the adjuvant effect of lgg in enhancing the immunogenicity of rotavirus, influenza virus, poliovirus, and salmonella typhi ty21a vaccines  <cit> . probiotics modulate immunity in the gi tract by interacting with a range of receptors on intestinal epithelial cells , m-cells and dendritic cells  <cit> . probiotics also enhance immunity beyond the gi tract through interactions with the common mucosal immune system.

microorganisms can be sensed via pattern recognition receptors  like toll-like receptors  to initiates innate immune response, in gi tract, thus affecting the development of the subsequent adaptive immune response. due to the heavy bacterial antigen load in the lumen, the expression of prrs is tightly regulated in iec  <cit> . the tlr pathways activate several different signaling elements, including nuclear factor kb  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase /c-jun-nh2-kinase /p <dig>  which regulate many immunologically relevant proteins  <cit> . nf-kb activation is essential for eliciting protective antigen-specific immune responses after vaccination  <cit> . modulation of the signaling pathway will have significant impact on vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy.

in this study, we used hgm transplanted gnotobiotic  pigs to investigate how two different dosing regimens of lgg impacted the intestinal bacterial communities and modulated the immune signaling pathway responses to an oral attenuated human rotavirus  vaccine. the knowledge will facilitate the selection of proper dosage of probiotics in their applications as vaccine adjuvants and as treatments of intestinal infectious or inflammatory diseases.

RESULTS
the lgg titers were the highest in atthrv + lgg14x pigs and increased over time in all pigs
the lgg titers were higher  or significantly higher  in the atthrv + lgg14x pigs than those of atthrv and atthrv + lgg9x pigs . the lgg titers increased over time from the beginning of lgg feeding for both dosage groups. interestingly, for the non-lgg fed atthrv pigs, the lgg titers also increased. at ppd  <dig>  the lgg titers were significantly higher than at ppd  <dig>  for all three pig groups.fig.  <dig> lgg fecal shedding in hgm-tranplanted gn pigs fed none , 9-dose  or 14-dose  of lgg. pid, post-first-atthrv-inoculation day. different lowercase letters on top of bars indicate significant differences compared among time points for the same treatment group; different capital letters on top of bars indicate significant differences compared among groups at each time point, while shared letters indicate no significant difference 



bacterial communities in feces of hgm transplanted pigs
the dgge profile of the hgm transplanted gn pigs at ppd  <dig> are showed in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  there is no significant difference in species richness  and shannon index of diversity  among different treatment groups. however, there is a trend for higher richness and diversity in the atthrv + lgg9x pigs than the other two groups. the similarity index of the individual pigs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .fig.  <dig> dgge of pcr products of v6-v <dig> regions of 16s rdna from bacteria in large intestinal contents of hgm-transplanted gn pigs fed none , 9-dose  or 14-dose  of lgg. pig no. 1– <dig> from atthrv group; pig no. 4– <dig> from atthrv + lgg9x group; and pig no. 7– <dig> from atthrv + lgg14x group

based on the similarity, the bacterial communities of atthrv + lgg14x pigs  is separated from the bacterial communities of the atthrv and atthrv + lgg9x pigs  . thus,  <dig> doses of lgg influenced the structure of the transplanted microbiota whereas  <dig> doses of lgg increased its richness and diversity, although not statistically significant.

the il- <dig>  tnf-α, il- <dig> and tlr <dig> mrna levels in atthrv + lgg9x pigs were significantly higher than the other groups
the relative mrna levels of the selected cytokine in ileal mncs were measured by real-time pcr. the il- <dig> mrna levels were significantly higher in atthrv + lgg9x pigs than that in atthrv pigs . no significant differences were found in il- <dig> mrna levels among different pig groups. the mrna levels of tnf-α and il- <dig> in atthrv + lgg9x pigs were also significantly higher than those in atthrv and atthrv + lgg14x pigs.fig.  <dig> effect of  <dig>  or  <dig>  doses of lgg on cytokine  and tlr  levels in ileal mncs of hgm-transplanted gn pigs. different letters on top of bars indicate significant differences compared among groups , while shared letters or no letters indicate no significant difference



the relative mrna levels of tlr <dig> were slightly but statistically higher in atthrv + lgg9x pigs than that in atthrv pigs . the mrna levels of tlr <dig> in atthrv + lgg9x pigs were significantly higher than those in atthrv and atthrv + lgg14x pigs. tlr <dig> mrna levels showed the same trend but did not differ significantly among the pig groups. thus,  <dig> doses, but not  <dig> doses of lgg significantly enhanced the innate cytokine and tlr responses at transcriptional level in the atthrv-vaccinated hgm pigs.

the levels of erk were significantly higher in atthrv + lgg9x pigs than in atthrv pigs. no significant difference was found in p-erk among different treatment groups. the ratios of p-erk/erk were significantly lower in atthrv + lgg9x and atthrv + lgg14x pigs than atthrv pigs; however, there was no significant difference between atthrv + lgg9x and atthrv + lgg14x pigs .

the level of p-nf-kb in atthrv pigs did not differ significantly from that in atthrv + lgg9x and atthrv + lgg14x pigs . the levels of p-nf-kb were significantly higher in atthrv + lgg9x pigs than in atthrv + lgg14x pigs. ikbα were almost undetectable in atthrv pigs . atthrv + lgg9x and atthrv + lgg14x pigs had significantly higher ikbα levels than atthrv pigs; no difference was found between the atthrv + lgg9x and atthrv + lgg14x pigs .

immunohistochemistry for cd <dig>  ifn-γ, p <dig>  p-p <dig>  erk and perk in ileal tissue
there is no significant difference in cd <dig>  or ifn-γ  expression levels among different treatment groups in immunohistochemistry. although there is no significant difference in p <dig> observed among different treatments in immunohistochemistry , the atthrv + lgg9x pigs had significantly higher p-p <dig> expression levels than the atthrv and atthrv + lgg14x pigs . the erk expression levels of the atthrv + lgg9x pigs were higher than the atthrv pigs and significantly higher than the atthrv + lgg14x pigs . the atthrv + lgg9x pigs had significantly higher perk expression level than the atthrv pigs .fig.  <dig> lgg treatment did not alter cd <dig> and ifn-γ expression in ileal tissues of the hgm-transplanted gn pigs at pid  <dig>  the levels of cd <dig>  and ifn-γ  were evaluated using semi-quantitative histopathology image analysis  following immunohistochemistry staining of paraffin embedded ileum sections. atthrv, n = 3; atthrv + lgg9x, n = 4; and atthrv + lgg14x, n =  <dig>  see fig.  <dig> legend for statistical analysis

discussion
intestinal microbiota play critical roles in the development of host immune responses  <cit> . the composition of gut microbes differentially affects the host intestinal mucosal immunity  <cit> . high levels of variation are apparent in the microbiota of neonates over time and between individuals  <cit> . studies using gn animals have the advantages of highly controlled repeatable experiment design, which reduces inter-individual variation  <cit> . in addition, gn pigs with a humanized microbiota better mimic the human infants than the germ-free pigs without gut microbiota. as reported in our previous publications  <cit> , hgm from a single healthy newborn infant was successfully transplanted into newborn gn pigs. in this study, we confirmed that the bacterial communities in gn pigs showed high similarity to the human donor in dgge band patterns. previous research indicated that human flora associated pigs yielded tgge  patterns similar to each other as well as to the human donor, but remarkably different from conventionally raised pigs  <cit> .

the relatively high titers of lgg found in feces and lic of pigs without lgg feeding indicate that there were native lgg in the human donor stool. lgg are often present in intestinal tract of humans  <cit> . the titers of lgg in lic were significantly higher in the atthrv + lgg14x pigs than that in the atthrv and atthrv + lgg9x pigs at ppd  <dig> , thus the high dose lgg feeding regimen increased the lgg fecal recovery. the significantly higher lgg titers concurred with significantly enhanced ileal hrv-specific ifn-γ producing t cell responses to the atthrv vaccine compared to atthrv and atthrv + lgg9x pigs reported in our previous publication  <cit> , suggesting the pro-th <dig> adjuvant effect of lgg.

probiotics are recognized to benefit the host through improvement of the balance of intestinal microbiota and through augmentation of host defense system  <cit> . probiotics can modulate the intestinal immune system by either directly affecting immune cell activities or through the positive manipulation of the gut microbiota  <cit> . a clinical study tested the impact of probiotics on the microbiome structure in 6-month old infants fed 1 × 109 cfu/day of lgg and found that communities containing high lgg levels clustered and were associated with a distinct bacterial community composition  <cit> . in the current study,  <dig> doses of lgg feeding influenced the structure of the transplanted microbiota whereas  <dig> doses of lgg slightly increased its richness and diversity. interestingly, the slightly increased richness and diversity of microbiota in the atthrv + lgg9x pigs, but not the significantly increased lgg fecal recovery in the atthrv + lgg14x pigs were associated with the enhanced cytokine and tlr mrna levels and signaling pathway activation in the ileal mncs of the hgm gn pigs. the difference in the two lgg feeding regimens for their timing in relation to atthrv vaccine inoculation and euthanasia of the pigs may also contribute to the difference besides the lgg dosage. further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of timing/frequency of probiotic intakes on modulating gut microbiome and immune responses.

many in vitro studies showed that probiotic bacteria stimulate innate immune cells  to promote expression of various pro- and antinflammatory cytokines and tlrs  <cit> , but evidence for this stimulatory effect in vivo, especially in the small intestine is limited. in this study, we found significantly higher mrna levels of il- <dig>  tnf-α, and il- <dig> in the ileal mncs of the  <dig> doses, but not  <dig> doses lgg fed pigs compared with the non-lgg fed pigs. our results concur with another dose response study reporting that lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc  <dig> feeding for one week at 1 × 109 cfu/dose, but not  <dig> × <dig> cfu/dose upregulated mrna levels of jejunal il- <dig>  ileal tgf-β <dig> and ileal il- <dig> after f4 + etec challenge in piglets  <cit> .

toll-like receptors initiate nf-kb and mapk cascades, which are the defense-related transcriptional factors. their activation leads to the production of cytokines  <cit> . excessive immune responses in the intestinal epithelium can be regulated via multiple mechanisms, including modulations of various tlrs expression and localization, or mediation of downstream immune-related cell signaling activation like nf-kb pathway  <cit> . these mechanisms are exerted synergistically to maintain immune responses homeostasis in gi tract  <cit> .

the role of tlr <dig> in the induction of innate responses by probiotic lactobacilli including l. rhamnosus in immune cells has been extensively demonstrated. tlr <dig> recognizes gram-positive bacterial lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan and lipoproteins. a previous study showed that lgg enhanced tlr <dig> mrna level, and tlr <dig> was required for nf-kb activation in macrophages  <cit> . another recent study confirmed the involvement of tlr <dig> signaling but not tlr <dig> in the upregulation of il-1β, il- <dig>  ifn-γ and il- <dig> mrna levels induced by l. rhamnosus in porcine intestinal antigen presenting cells challenged with virus dsrna analogue poly   <cit> . in the present study, no significant difference was found in the level of tlr <dig> mrna level among treatment groups. tlr <dig> recognizes bacterial cpg dna and synthetic unmethylated cpg oligonucleotide mimics   <cit> . it is known that the genomes of many lactobacilli strains are rich in cpg islands  <cit> ; therefore, lactobacilli may exert a stimulating effect via activation of tlr <dig> on immune cells. expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and nod <dig> mrna is upregulated in the intestines of pigs pretreated with a low, but not a high, dose of l. rhamnosus  <cit> . in the present study, tlr <dig> mrna level was significantly increased in atthrv + lgg9x pigs compared to the other two groups. the significantly higher tlr <dig> mrna level was associated with the significantly higher il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α mrna expression in the atthrv + lgg9x pigs compared to the other groups, indicating that cpg induced tlr <dig> signaling is likely one of the pathways that lgg stimulated the secretion of the cytokines. our results are consistent with the observation that l. rhamnosus induced cytokine responses  in a tlr9-dependent manner in human blood mncs, but the role of tlr <dig> could not be demonstrated  <cit> .

tlr <dig> recognizes lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the level of tlr <dig> mrna in atthrv + lgg9x pigs was slightly but statistically higher than that in the non-lgg fed atthrv pigs. the effect of lgg on tlr <dig> mrna levels can only be indirectly since lgg does not contain tlr <dig> ligands. in general, tlr <dig> level is downregulated by anti-inflammatory probiotics  <cit> . in the present study, the increase in tlr <dig> mrna levels is consistent with the increased pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in the atthrv + lgg9x pigs. the possible reasons for the upregulated tlr <dig> can be the increased richness and diversity of microbiota in the atthrv + lgg9x pigs and that certain bacteria species in the microbiota promoted tlr <dig> expression.

in response to inflammatory signals, the mapk cascade is activated through phosphorylation of p <dig>  erk, and jnk, which is associated with the activation and translocation of nf-kb from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  <cit> . nf-kb is known to play a central role in inflammatory responses and is involved in transcriptional regulation of many cytokine genes, including tnf-α  <cit> . previous research suggested that both nf-kb and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways were important for the production of cytokines and chemokines induced by l. acidophilus ncfm  <cit> . inhibition of mapks family pathway, such as erk, p <dig>  and jnk, alleviates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . previous research also indicated that p <dig> mapk and erk-1/ <dig> cross-regulate each other such that inhibition of one enhances activation of the other and the effector functions induced in response to different stimuli  <cit> . we therefore examined whether lgg could induce cytokine responses by activation of p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig>  in western blot analysis, the atthrv + lgg9x and atthrv + lgg14x pigs had significantly higher ratio of p-p38/p <dig>  whereas lower p-erk/erk than the atthrv pigs. this result verified their reciprocal association. the ihc analysis generally verified the result that atthrv + lgg9x had the highest p-p <dig> and erk1/ <dig> in western blot. there was one exception for perk that the atthrv + lgg9x pigs had significantly higher perk than the atthrv pigs in ihc  but not in western blot  analysis.

erk pathway plays key regulatory functions in a diverse spectrum of biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and motility  <cit>  and has important immunoregulatory role in maintaining homeostasis in the intestine  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> doses lgg increased levels of erk and perk as observed in western blotting and ihc, respectively, indicating that the activation of erk pathway by lgg could have protective role against viral infection-induced mucosal injury.

atthrv + lgg9x pigs had significantly higher levels of p-nf-kb than the atthrv + lgg14x pigs; but neither pig group significantly differed from the atthrv pigs. the result indicates that  <dig> doses lgg further activated the nf-kb, but  <dig> doses prevented the further nf-kb activation. nf-kb is located in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound to ikbα, which is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded, and the degradation of ikbα results in the dissociation of activated nf-kb from ikbα  <cit> . pre-treatment of ht <dig> and t <dig> polarized cell monolayers using purified dna from lgg delayed nf-kb activation, stabilized levels of ikbα, and attenuated il- <dig> secretion in response to stimulation by salmonella dna or tnf-a  <cit> . in the present study, both lgg dosing regimens significantly increased the ikbα level, which indicates that lgg may have inhibited inflammation by increasing the ikbα level to balance the activation of nf-kb  <cit> . therefore, the reduced transcription of tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the atthrv + lgg14x pigs may not be due to the lack of impact of lgg on the signaling pathways, rather it reflected the active effect of the higher dose lgg in attenuation of nf-kb activation.

adequate pro-inflammatory cytokine responses contribute to clearance of pathogen, but excessive inflammatory immune responses lead to tissue injuries. therefore, an appropriate balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators is crucial for an effective and safe response against infection  <cit> . il- <dig> is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine that might be beneficial in the course of infection by attenuating the excessive host inflammatory response induced by upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus controlling immunopathology. several studies have demonstrated that induction of the regulatory il- <dig> by probiotic lactobacilli such as l. rhamnosus plays an important role in controlling inflammatory process upon a viral infection to minimize tissue injury  <cit> . in the present study, we showed that  <dig> doses lgg induced higher mrna level of both pro-inflammatory cytokines  and anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> when compared with atthrv and atthrv + lgg14x. therefore, the improved production of il- <dig> induced by appropriate dose of lgg would allow an efficient regulation of the inflammatory response and avoid tissue damage during intestinal viral infections. modulation of the nf-kb and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways may also have a significant impact on atthrv vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy via upregulating cytokine productions. indeed, the increased il- <dig> and tnf-α mrna levels were associated with significantly enhanced intestinal iga responses in the atthrv + lgg9x pigs postchallenge as we reported previously  <cit> . although the vaccine-induced protection over all did not differ significantly among atthrv only, atthrv + lgg9x and atthrv + lgg14x groups, the atthrv + lgg9x pigs had the shortest mean duration of diarrhea and virus shedding and significantly lower cumulative fecal diarrhea scores  <cit> .

there is an apparent discrepancy between the significantly increased hrv-specific ifn-γ producing t cell responses in the  <dig> doses, but not  <dig> doses, lgg fed hgm pigs  <cit>  and the significantly stronger cytokine, tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathway responses in the  <dig> doses, but not  <dig> doses, lgg fed hgm pigs. it is important to note the difference in the cell populations studied for the t cell responses  versus the signaling pathway responses . it might have made interpreting the results and discrepancy easier if our studies were performed using sorted t cells and dendritic cells. an in vitro study using human dendritic cells showed that lgg significantly down-regulated p <dig> expression and negatively regulated nf-kb through down-regulatory effect on mir-146a expression  <cit> . although the role of nf-kb pathway in t cell development and function has been well studied  <cit> , the relationship between p <dig> mapk signaling pathway and t cell development is not so clear. further studies are needed to explain the observed discrepancy.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the two different lgg doses exerted divergent effects on gut microbiota structure and on intestinal immune responses. these results are important since they revealed that the relationship between modulation of gut microbiota and regulation of host immunity using probiotics is complex. more in vivo studies are needed to better understand mechanisms of action of this probiotic strain in its applications as treatment of intestinal infectious or inflammatory disease and as a vaccine adjuvant. an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of immunomodulation will facilitate the development of next-generation probiotics and will enhance our understanding of host-microbial interactions.
