BACKGROUND
the regulation of cellular functions is achieved through the contribution and interactions of genetic, signaling and metabolic pathways. consequently, cellular processes may be singularly regulated, i.e., at the gene or transcription level, or controlled by a network of interactions of genes, proteins and metabolites. therefore, understanding the biological function of the myriad of genes and how these genes and gene products interact and regulate each other to yield a functional cell would help to identify more appropriate pathways that should be targeted or studied for a given disease.

novel analytical frameworks are required to unravel the regulatory and functional relationships from profiles of genes, proteins and metabolites. approaches have been developed to infer genome wide networks from high throughput data. these approaches typically require genome-wide interaction data  <cit>  or a wide range of perturbation data  <cit> , which have been applied to yeast and human b cells, respectively, to reverse engineer genome wide gene regulatory networks. unfortunately, genome-wide interaction measurements as well as large amounts of perturbation data are not easily or readily obtainable for researchers working with mammalian systems. thus, a challenge remains to reconstruct networks from a small amount of perturbation data. the small perturbation data size poses a challenge to statistical inference and makes it extremely hard to infer genome wide networks with any degree of confidence  <cit> . to address this, we developed an approach to identify a smaller network of active pathways rather than genome wide networks based upon a subset of important genes selected by integrating gene expression and phenotypic profiles. the approach first integrates genetic algorithm coupled partial least squares analysis   <cit>  and constrained independent component analysis   <cit>  to identify a subset of genes relevant to a phenotype. next, bn analysis is used to reconstruct an active sub-network from this smaller group of genes to reveal which pathways are induced by the external stimuli or environmental factors. applying bn to a reduced subset of genes also circumvents the inefficiency of the bn analysis in inferring large size networks, such as is the case with genome wide networks. bn can detect indirect influences and unmeasured events and is not susceptible to the existence of unobserved variables  <cit> . it has been applied to infer gene regulatory network of yeast cell cycle from gene expression data, metabolic sub-networks from metabolic data and protein signaling network from protein activity data  <cit> . the reconstructed network was then used to predict the effect of perturbing a gene on the other genes in the network with bn inference, and thus provided insight into how the genes interacted within the network to produce a specific phenotype.

as proof-of-concept, the framework was applied to identify the pathways that confer cytotoxicity in hepg2/c3a cells. liver toxicity is often used to assess the safety of drugs and is a primary reason for drug recalls  <cit> . therefore, predicting liver toxicity earlier in the drug development process would be valuable. in the current study, saturated ffa, palmitate, was found to induce liver toxicity, and this effect was exacerbated by the presence of tnf-α. indeed, elevated levels of ffas and tnf-α have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of liver disorders, such as fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis  <cit> . therefore, we applied our approach to this model system from the standpoint that if we can identify pathways that may attenuate the toxicity in the presence of ffas and tnf-α, perhaps this model could be applied eventually to drug candidates to identify pathways that may be modulated to enhance the efficacy and minimize the toxicity of the drug. we analyzed the genetic responses of the hepatocytes to physiologically elevated levels of ffas and tnf-α to identify pathways involved in conferring cytotoxicity, and which in turn may provide insight into the physiological actions of these factors.

we developed a tips© framework that first applied ga/pls  <cit>  and independent component analysis   <cit>  to identify a subset of genes relevant to cytotoxicity. we assumed, as a first approximation, a log linear relationship between gene expression and cytotoxicity. the genes selected by ga/pls were initially corroborated with published results to identify known interactions. in order to extract an independent pathway related to a phenotype, such as cytotoxicity, from the gene expression profile, we propose a constrained ica  approach. the relevance of the genes to the toxicity identified by ga/pls along with the cytotoxicity profiles were used as constraints in cica. cica extracted a phenotype-relevant-component from the gene expression data. cica assumes that the expression profile of thousands of genes can be represented by a reduced number of mutually independent processes. biologically meaningful gene groups have been successfully identified by ica  <cit> . a phenotype-relevant-component was identified by minimizing the mutual information between the phenotype-relevant-component and the other independent components while maximizing the correlation between the component and the constraints. the expression profiles of the genes with the highest weights in cica were used in bn analysis for network reconstruction. the reconstructed network was perturbed to identify i) which genes, when perturbed, had an impact on altering the cytotoxic phenotype in the palmitate cultures, and ii) how perturbing one gene  affected the other genes in the network. the reconstructed network provided potential explanation on how palmitate and tnf-α induced cytotoxicity. the model identified  the roles played by stearoyl-coa desaturase , double-stranded-rna-dependent protein kinase  and bcl- <dig> in the palmitate-induced cytotoxicity, and  the activation of nuclear factor kappa b  by tnf-α is mediated by protein kinase c delta . these simulated perturbations of the reconstructed network were evaluated experimentally to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

RESULTS
 <dig>  identifying genes relevant to cytotoxicity using ga/pls
lactate dehydrogenase  release was measured as an indicator of the cytotoxicity. we found that exposing hepg2/c3a cells to ffas  in the presence and absence of tnf-α, only palmitate was cytotoxic to the cells and resulted in significantly higher ldh release . tnf-α alone was not toxic to the cells. the cytotoxic effect of tnf-α was observed only in the palmitate-treated cells. exposure to oleate or linoleate was not cytotoxic, but caused the cells to accumulate intracellular triglycerides . to obtain a global view of the changes induced by ffas and tnf-α, we capitalized upon high-throughput cdna microarrays to quantify the gene expression profiles of the hepg2/c3a cells.

we applied ga/pls to the gene expression and ldh release profiles. the ga/pls algorithm counted the frequency with which each gene was selected to predict ldh release and provided a measure of the relevance of each gene to ldh release  <cit> . the genes with high frequency were organized into functional groups based on the literature information on the functional role of these genes, as shown in table  <dig>  evaluating the groups of genes assigned high frequency by ga/pls suggested that the functional groups such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, tnf-signaling, mitochondria were relevant to the cytotoxicity. several of these potential mechanisms suggested by the ga/pls results were experimentally validated. for example, the identification of oxidative stress related genes suggested a possible involvement of reactive oxygen species  in the palmitate-induced cytotoxicity. indeed, we found the ros level was elevated in the palmitate cultured cells and adding ros scavengers prevented the cytotoxicity induced by palmitate  <cit> . in addition, the caspase- <dig> activities were significantly elevated in the palmitate cultures as shown in figure  <dig>  which corroborated the involvement of apoptosis in the observed cytotoxicity. finally, identification of translocase of outer/inner mitochondria membrane  which are known to be related to mitochondrial potential  <cit>  were corroborated by the reduced mitochondrial potential in the palmitate cultured cells  <cit> .

 <dig>  identifying genes involved in an independent pathway related to cytotoxicity using cica
ga/pls determined the frequency with which each gene was selected to predict ldh release. the frequencies and the profile of ldh release were applied as structure and profile constraints respectively in cica to extract a phenotype-relevant-component from the gene expression profile, see methods for more details. the independent component in this case identified a subset of genes whose profiles corresponded to the profile of ldh release. cica determined the weights for each gene by minimizing the mutual information between the independent components and maximizing the correlation to the constraints. the weights determined by cica are in the additional files . genes that had weights significantly different from zero with a 95% confidence using the z-test were subjected to bn analysis for pathway reconstruction.

 <dig>  reconstruct pathways related to cytotoxicity using bn
bn reconstructed how the genes, identified by cica, are connected in a network and involved in regulating cytotoxicity. the resulting network is shown in figure  <dig>  to evaluate potential pathways involved in palmitate-induced cytotoxicity, we performed in silico perturbation analyses with bn inference and experimentally validated the reconstructed network.

 <dig>  perturbation of the reconstructed network
the reconstructed network allowed us to perturb the network in silico to identify which nodes had an impact on modulating ldh release. bn inference was used to predict the effect of perturbing a single gene/node on i) the other gene within the network, and ii) the level of ldh release in the palmitate cultures. the predictions of the simulated perturbations were subsequently confirmed with inhibitor  experiments. we altered the activity of the nodes by inhibiting  the protein activity. perturbations of the scd  and pkr  were simulated with bn inference to evaluate their effects on cytotoxicity, whereas pkc-δ  was perturbed to predict its effect on nf-κb activation.

 <dig>  role of stearoyl-coa desaturase  in palmitate-induced cytotoxicity
scd was found closely connected to ldh and acetyl-coa carboxylase  in the reconstructed network. both of these connections are supported by the literature  <cit> . scd is the rate-limiting enzyme to produce monounsaturated fatty acids. its deficiency has been found to increase fatty acid oxidation by activating amp-activated protein kinase  in the liver. ampk phosphorylates acc at ser- <dig> which leads to the inhibition of acc activity and decreased malonyl-coa concentration  <cit> . malonyl-coa inhibits carnitine palmitoyl-coa transferase   <cit> . thus, a decrease in the levels of malonyl-coa activates cpt- <dig> and increases fatty acid beta-oxidation in the mitochondrion. in the palmitate cultures, the protein expression level of scd  was reduced as compared to the control and the oleate cultures. however, co-supplementing the palmitate cultures with oleate restored the scd protein expression level  and correspondingly reduced the ldh release , which indicated a protective role of scd. this may explain, in part, the preference of the hepg2/c3a cells to oxidize palmitate as opposed to synthesizing triglycerides from it, as was done with the unsaturated fatty acids. in support of this, knockout of the scd gene in mice has been found to increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation  <cit> .

to investigate the role of scd in modulating palmitate-induced cytotoxicity, we simulated an upregulation of scd in the reconstructed network by setting the scd gene expression to a higher level in silico. up-regulating scd reduced the probability that the ldh release would remain high from ~67% to ~35% . the simulation results agreed well with the literature, e.g., over-expressing scd protected cho cells from palmitate-induced cytotoxicity  <cit> .

the probability of ldh release taking on a high or low level in the palmitate cultures. bn inference was used to conduct the simulations of up-regulation of scd, down-regulation of pkr, and up-regulation of nf-kb. "↓" indicates decreased probability and "↑" indicates increased probability.

to experimentally validate the simulation results, we supplemented the cell cultures with  <dig> μm of clofibrate or ciprofibrate to increase the scd activity. the scd <dig> activity can be transcriptionally activated by clofibrate or ciprofibrate, which are known to increase the activity of scd through a ppar independent pathway  <cit> . the fibrate supplementation significantly decreased the ldh release in the palmitate cultures . therefore, bn inference correctly identified scd as a relevant factor in palmitate-induced cytotoxicity.

 <dig>  role of bcl- <dig> and pkr in palmitate-induced cytotoxicity
bcl- <dig> is a group of proteins including pro-apoptotic members, such as bax, bid, bad, and anti-apoptotic ones such as bcl- <dig>  bcl-xl, bcl-w. anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> protein inhibits apoptosis by guarding the mitochondrial gate against the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspases. bcl- <dig> was found to be connected to factors such as pkr, tom <dig>  eif2b and cpt- <dig> . the protein expression level of bcl- <dig> in cultured hepg <dig> cells as a function of tnf-α concentrations was measured by western blotting . tnf-α  suppressed the protein expression level of bcl- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner. palmitate, similarly, decreased the bcl- <dig> protein expression level significantly as compared to the control and oleate cultures. the suppression of bcl- <dig> may explain, in part, the cytotoxic effects of palmitate and tnf-α in the palmitate cultured cells . in support of this finding, over-expression of bcl- <dig> in 2b <dig>  t cell hybridoma cell lines have been shown to inhibit palmitate-induced cytotoxicity  <cit> . while tnf-α and oleate also reduced the bcl- <dig> levels, they did not produce any overt toxicity by themselves. this indicates that perhaps, the reduction in bcl- <dig> alone is not sufficient to cause toxicity. however, a reduction in bcl- <dig> levels would prime the cells to other insults such as oxidative stress. only palmitate, and not oleate or tnf-α, caused ros production as well as a reduction in the bcl- <dig> levels. thus, reduced bcl- <dig> levels would have only worsened the toxicity produced by the oxidative stress. therefore, reducing bcl- <dig> may be one of the ways in which ffa and tnf-α made cells susceptible to toxicity.

in the reconstructed network, bcl- <dig> was connected to the translocase of outer membrane  and carnitine palmitoyl transferase . these connections are supported by published literature results. targeting the bcl- <dig> protein to the mitochondria is mediated by the interaction between the c terminus of bcl- <dig> and tom <dig>  <cit> . similarly, a direct interaction between bcl- <dig> and cpt- <dig> has been confirmed through a co-immunoprecipitation study  <cit> , thus a direct connection between bcl- <dig> and cpt- <dig> found by the model is encouraging.

the model found pkr to be indirectly connected to bcl- <dig>  pkr, an interferon-inducible serine/threonine kinase, has been found to mediate a number of signal transduction pathways involved in immune response, tumorigenesis and regulation of apoptosis. pkr is best known for its role in virus infection and regulating cellular apoptosis  <cit> . in our model, simulating a down-regulation in the pkr node predicted a decrease in the ldh release  and an increase in the bcl- <dig> level in the palmitate cultures . indeed we found that inhibiting pkr  in the palmitate cultures up-regulated the bcl- <dig> protein expression  and decreased the ldh release from ~50% to ~40%. therefore, the model appropriately identified pkr to be an important factor involved in regulating bcl- <dig> protein expression, and in turn the cytotoxicity.

the probability of bcl- <dig> taking on a high or low level in the palmitate cultures. bn inference was used to conduct the simulations of down-regulation of pkr. "↓" indicates decreased probability and "↑" indicates increased probability. this was validated experimentally as shown in figure  <dig> 

pkr was also found to be connected to apoptosis inhibitor , which is connected to pp2ab <dig> and apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer , and the latter is connected to eif2b suggesting that these factors are likely to be involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway. these connections are supported by published results in the literature. caspase- <dig> activity was enhanced in the palmitate cultured cells , which may result in enhanced phosphorylation of eif2-α. pkr can be cleaved by caspase- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> to liberate the eif2-α kinase domain, which phosphorylates eif2-α  <cit> . phosphorylation of eif2-α by pkr will inhibit protein synthesis and lead to apoptosis  <cit> . pkr also can bind to pp2a at the b <dig> alpha regulatory subunit  and increase the phosphatase activity of pp2a  <cit> . pp2a is a major ser/thr phosphatase involved in many signal transduction pathways. pp2a can dephosphorylate and inactivate the anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> at ser- <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig>  activation of nf-κb by tnf-α is mediated by pkc-δ
we found that the phospho-p <dig> nf-κb levels to be significantly lower in the palmitate cultures than in the oleate and linoleate  and control cultures shown in figure  <dig>  bn inference predicted that an up-regulation of nf-κb in the palmitate cultures would decrease the probability of ldh release being high . nf-κb is an important cytoprotective transcription factor, which can be activated by oxidative stress and cytokines, including tnf-α <cit> . from figure  <dig> we find that the connection between tnf-α and nf-κb is linked through pkc-δ, suggesting that pkc-δ is an intermediate factor in the activation of nf-κ b. connections between tnf-α, pkc-δ and nf-κb have been identified in cells such as neutrophils  <cit>  and pancreatic acinar cells  <cit> . inhibiting pkc-δ has been shown to attenuate tnf-α-mediated activation of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor nf-κb in adherent neutrophils  <cit> , but showed no effect on nf-κb activation in cultured myometrial cells  <cit> , thus suggesting the pathway is cell dependent. there has been no study to date indicating that pkc-δ mediates tnf-α 's activation of nf-κb in hepg <dig> cells. our model suggests that down-regulating pkc-δ will decrease the probability of nf-κb taking on a high expression level in the medium  cultures . to determine whether pkc-δ is involved in mediating the activation of nf-κb by tnf-α in hepg <dig> cells, we added rottlerin, an inhibitor of pkc-δ, and measured the activity levels of nf-κb by western blotting. rottlerin is a pkc-δ specific inhibitor that inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of pkc-δ, which to our knowledge does not interfere with any of the components in the nf-κb activation pathway. the activity of nf-κb was measured by detecting the levels of phosphorylated nf-κb p <dig> at ser- <dig>  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the activation of nf-κb p <dig> was attenuated by rottlerin. therefore, pkc-δ was appropriately identified by the model to be an important factor in mediating the tnf-α signaling to nf-κb.

the probability of nf-κβ taking on a high or low level. the model predicts that a down-regulation in pkc-δ will decrease the probability of nf-κβ taking on a high value. this was validated experimentally and shown in figure  <dig>  "↓" indicates decreased probability and "↑" indicates increased probability.

discussion
with the availability of high dimensional biological data to characterize a cellular state, one of the challenges is the development of robust methods that can integrate various orthogonal datasets to identify the genes and pathways that induce a phenotype. the significance of the tips© framework is its ability to extract relevant information, both known and unknown, from high dimensional data. the phenotypic profile was used to guide the information extraction process. proteins relay information from the genes to execute biological functions, which define the cellular phenotype. thus, the effects of regulation occurring at the protein level manifest themselves in the phenotype. this paper illustrates that uncovering this information at the protein  level may be achieved by integrating phenotype and gene expression data.

a handful of the connections were selected to illustrate the effectiveness of the framework. the selection was not intended to be comprehensive or exclusive of other potentially valid connections. the connections selected for further analysis and discussion were based upon i) evidence in the literature that a potential relationship may exist, although it may not be known what the exact nature of the relationship is or its relevance to toxicity, and ii) whether materials, e.g. assays or antibodies, are available to allow us to evaluate the connections.

currently, only one phenotypic profile, e.g., ldh release, was used to identify the active network perturbed by tnf-α and ffa exposure. metabolic profiles, which characterize the cellular phenotype, may also be used as constraints. incorporating more metabolic profiles would improve the characterization of the phenotype and in turn the network reconstruction and predictions. an approach to add more constraints would be to apply ica or pls to extract several latent variables from the metabolic profiles  <cit> . in addition, the current tips© approach selects genes based upon the data without considering a priori knowledge of the system under investigation. using a purely data driven approach may result in important genes with modest changes escaping detection by statistical analysis such as anova. incorporating domain knowledge into the tips© approach could improve the selection of relevant genes. the prior knowledge could be incorporated with approaches such as gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . gsea incorporates functional pathway information in the selection of significantly enriched functional gene groups.

additionally, the current tips© approach reconstructs pathways from gene expression and metabolic profiles at a single time point. dynamic regulatory interactions may be inferred if data from multiple time points are available. indeed, the underlying biological regulatory mechanism is likely to be dynamic in response to changes in the environmental conditions. a power law model has been applied in continuous dynamic bayesian network  analysis to model the connection between genes  <cit> . the power law model can easily be extended to allow for delayed transcription  <cit> . both discrete  <cit>  and continuous  <cit>  dbn has been applied to model gene regulatory networks. therefore, to detect the dynamic property of biological networks, we plan to obtain time series data and incorporate a dynamic bayesian network reconstruction component into the tips© framework.

due to computational limitation as well as limited data, it is not possible to reconstruct a network with high confidence using all the genes across the genome. ga/pls and ica provided an approach to identify a relevant subset of genes for further analysis. however, useful information may be missed in the selection process or not identified due to low abundance transcripts. to address the former, an approach would be to use a more targeted array with a smaller subset of genes. to address the latter, methods such as kinetically monitored reverse transcriptase-initiated pcr  could be used to measure genes with low abundance transcripts  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that tips© may be applied to reconstruct the active associations from gene expression and phenotypic profiles to help elucidate the pathways involved in regulating palmitate-induced cytotoxicity. the pathways identified and shown in figure  <dig> are specific to the cytotoxicity induced by ffa and tnf-α. if other compounds were applied to a cell culture system , new microarray and phenotype data would have to be collected and the tips© analysis applied to identify a different set of relevant genes specific to those compounds. this is important because many connections are context-specific . for instance, the regulation of bcl- <dig> by tnfα is cell dependent. tnf-α suppresses bcl- <dig> in fao rat hepatoma cells  <cit>  while it induces bcl- <dig> in rat hippocampal neuron cells  <cit> . similarly, signaling pathways are stimuli specific, for example, tnfα activates ikk activity with a negative feedback through a <dig> while lps activates ikk activity with a positive feedback through a different pathway involving nf-κb and irf <dig>  <cit> . therefore, whether a pathway is activated will depend on the type of cell and the condition under consideration. the advantage of tips© is that it allows for these differences and aims to reconstruct these pathways from the context-specific data.
