BACKGROUND
a key regulatory step in eukaryotic transcription initiation is the assembly of basal transcription apparatus at the core promoter. this apparatus includes rna polymerase ii  and a set of basal transcription factors. for a long time the basal transcriptional machinery was thought to be universal and mainly invariant across different promoters. however, a growing body of evidence points towards a more dynamic and regulatory role for this machinery . tata-box binding protein  was once thought to be the general transcription factor involved in all transcription in eukaryotic cells. in higher eukaryotes, however, a number of tbp paralogs are present and there is clear evidence for tbp-independent transcription in a variety of model organisms  <cit> . so far three tbp paralogs have been described in metazoans; the insect-specific tbp-related factor  <dig>   <cit> , the metazoan-specific tbp-like factor   <cit>  and the vertebrate-specific factor tbp <dig>   <cit> .

tbp <dig> is the most closely related tbp paralog, sharing 95% sequence identity in the core domain  <cit> . it can bind to tata box, interacts with tfiia and tfiib and promotes basal transcription in vitro. in addition, knockdown studies in fish and frogs showed that tbp <dig> is indispensable for embryonic development  <cit>  and is preferentially required for the transcription of embryonic vertebrate-specific genes and those involved in ventral specification during gastrulation in xenopus  <cit> . tbp <dig> is also essential in differentiation pathways in zebrafish and mouse  <cit> . although some tbp <dig> is present and required in early xenopus embryos, it is most abundant in oocytes, suggesting that tbp <dig> has an important role in oocyte transcription  <cit> . here we provide functional evidence for the role of tbp <dig> in pol-ii transcription by examining its binding to oocyte chromosomes and pol-ii promoters, and by employing in vivo transcriptional assays involving an altered binding specificity mutant reporter system. we show that tbp <dig> is localized to active promoters in oocytes and can promote pol-ii transcription. tbp <dig> is degraded during meiotic maturation. surprisingly, tbp, when exogenously expressed in oocytes, can substitute for tbp <dig>  which is indicative of dynamic and rapidly adaptable nature of core transcription machinery. together, these observations establish the involvement of tbp <dig> in transcription initiation of oocytes. moreover the proteolytic degradation of tbp <dig> during meiotic maturation is relevant for the initiation factor switching that occurs during the course of early development.

methods
constructs
the xenopus tbp   <cit>  and tbp <dig>   <cit>  constructs were utilized to generate altered binding specificity mutant versions of these proteins by introducing three point mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of xtbp  and xtbp <dig>  using the quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit . capped mrnas were transcribed by an in vitro rna synthesis kit . pcmv-cat and pg4-hsp70-cat have already been described  <cit>  whereas pg4-blcat- zfp36l <dig>  pg4-blcat-tlf, pg4-blcat-polr2h and pg4-blcat-cyr <dig> and pg4-blcat-intron  gene) were generated by cloning these promoters amplified from x. tropicalis genomic dna, into pg4-blcat <dig>  <cit>  at the bamhi and xhoi sites .

germinal vesicle spreads and immunofluorescence
germinal vesicle  spreads were prepared as described in  <cit>  with minor modifications. defolliculated stage vi oocytes were transferred one at a time to isolation medium . the gv was isolated, the nuclear membrane was removed and the contents of gv quickly transferred to  <dig> μl of spreading medium containing 1% paraformaldehyde and  <dig> % triton x- <dig> on a glass cover slip. the cover slips were kept at room temperature for  <dig> hr before being stored in phosphate-buffered saline . gv spreads were rinsed in pbs containing  <dig> % tween and blocked with  <dig> % bovine serum albumin and  <dig> % gelatin followed by  <dig> hr incubations with primary and secondary antibodies at room temperature. tbp <dig> antibody 1g <dig> has already been described  <cit>  whereas 3e <dig> is a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the amino-terminal domain of xenopus tbp <dig>  the secondary antibody was alexa 488-labelled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin g  in a 1: <dig> dilution also containing  <dig> μg/ml 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole . images were taken with zeiss axiophot <dig> fluorescence microscope.

microinjections and primer extension
defolliculated oocytes were injected with  <dig> ng of in vitro-transcribed tbp/2-abs rna in the cytoplasm using a drummond nanoject microinjection apparatus . after a delay of  <dig> hr, gvs of these oocytes were injected with different amounts of plasmid constructs as indicated in the text and figure legends. the next day the oocytes were collected and rna was isolated using trizol  extraction and licl precipitation. the rna equivalent to four oocytes was analyzed by primer extension as described in  <cit> .

meiotic maturation and western blotting
stage vi oocytes were incubated at 18°c in mbsh buffer containing  <dig> μg/ml progesterone . maturing oocytes were synchronized at germinal vesicle break down  and then collected at different time points as indicated in the figure legends. extracts from collected oocytes were prepared as previously described  <cit> . the antibodies used were anti-tbp 58c <dig>  anti-tfiib c- <dig>  anti-tfiif rap  <dig> c- <dig>  anti-mos c <dig> , anti-phospho-p44/ <dig> map kinase , anti-tbp sl <dig>  sl <dig> and sl <dig>  <cit>  and anti-h <dig> core and anti-h3ser10p .

chromatin immunoprecipitation
stage vi oocytes were injected with promoter constructs  in the nucleus. after overnight incubation at 18°c, oocytes were cross-linked and processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation  as described previously  <cit> . for chip of ha-tagged tbp,  <dig> ng mrna encoding ha-tbp <dig> was injected in the cytoplasm  <dig> hr prior to nuclear injections. the antibodies used were anti tbp- <dig> 1g <dig>  <cit> , anti-rna polymerase ii  and anti-ha .

electrophoretic mobility shift assay
an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  was performed essentially as described in  <cit>  and  <cit> .

RESULTS
regulated proteolytic degradation of tbp <dig> during meiotic maturation
tbp accumulates due to regulated translation of tbp mrna during cleavage stages of development  <cit> , whereas it is not detectable in oocytes . tbp <dig>  by contrast, is very abundant in oocytes but is expressed at very low levels in embryos, suggesting that tbp <dig> is a replacement core promoter factor for tbp in oocytes  <cit> . to examine the possibility that the lack of detection of tbp in oocytes is due to a modification of tbp in these cells that masks its epitope, we probed oocyte , egg  and late blastula  embryo extracts with 58c <dig> antibody, which recognizes both tbp and tbp <dig>  and three different tbp-specific antibodies, sl <dig>  sl <dig> and sl <dig>  none of the antibodies detect tbp in oocytes , confirming that there is very little if any tbp present in xenopus oocytes. low levels of tbp are detected in egg extracts, whereas it is very abundant in embryos , consistent with regulated translation of maternal tbp mrna in cleavage-stage embryos  <cit> .

tbp <dig> on the other hand is abundant in oocytes, whereas in eggs and early embryos very low levels of tbp <dig> are present. this was also observed when oocyte gv and embryonic nuclear extracts were probed with a tbp2-specific monoclonal antibody 3e <dig> . the mechanism of the decrease in tbp <dig> expression, however, is unknown. to investigate this issue we followed the tbp <dig> levels during the course of oocyte maturation. this can be done in vitro by treating fully grown stage vi oocytes with progesterone. the maturation is marked by the appearance of a spot on the animal pole of the oocyte as a result of gvbd. tbp <dig> levels start to drop within  <dig> min after gvbd and by  <dig> hr the protein is hardly detectable . this was further assessed by looking at some markers of meiotic maturation in oocytes, including degradation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein and phosphorylation of mapk and histone h <dig> serine <dig>  tbp <dig> downregulation coincides with the accumulation of xenopus mos protein . the mos protein is a kinase that plays an important role in oocyte maturation. in response to progesterone treatment, the translation of mos mrna and the stability of the mos protein increase, resulting in the gradual accumulation of the protein  <cit> .

to examine the kinetics of overexpressed tbp and tbp <dig> in maturing oocytes, oocytes were injected with mrna encoding tbp and ha-tbp <dig>  and treated with progesterone. the injected synthetic tbp mrna lacks its native 5' and 3'-utr and is translated in oocytes, in contrast to the endogenous maternal tbp mrna which is translationally masked  <cit> . the kinetics of overexpressed tbp and tbp <dig> are similar, although the levels of endogenous tbp <dig> tend to decrease more rapidly , which may reflect differences in expression level at the start of the experiment.

to assess whether the decrease in tbp <dig> levels is due to changes in translation or degradation, oocytes were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. to check translation efficiency under these conditions oocytes were injected with tbp mrna in the presence and absence of this inhibitor. after  <dig> hr of incubation with cycloheximide there was hardly any effect on tbp <dig> levels, showing that tbp <dig> protein is quite stable in oocytes, whereas in progesterone-treated cells tbp <dig> expression is lost . therefore, proteolytic degradation of tbp <dig> is markedly increased during meiotic maturation. tbp, when ectopically expressed in oocytes, is also degraded during maturation although residual levels after maturation are substantially higher, similar to the situation when tbp <dig> is overexpressed . intriguingly, even well after gvbd, tbp <dig> is not completely degraded, which is consistent with the observation that some tbp <dig> persists in early xenopus embryos .

tbp <dig> decorates lampbrush chromosomes
in the absence of tbp, tbp <dig> may be the major tata box binding initiation factor in oocytes, and as such should localize to lampbrush chromosomes. these are partially condensed paired chromosomes present in the gvs of amphibian oocytes, arrested in the diplotene stage  of meiosis i. transcriptional activity is accommodated by numerous laterally extended loops along the length of each of these chromosomes  <cit> . gv spreads were prepared from stage vi oocytes and the chromosome axis and the lateral loops were visualized using dapi. interestingly, many loops are decorated with tbp <dig>  as shown with two different tbp <dig> monoclonal antibodies. nucleoli do not show any tbp <dig> staining; by contrast, cajal bodies  and b-snurposomes , which are considered to be the depositories of transcription complexes and related proteins  <cit> , stain positive. the two tbp <dig> antibodies used recognize different epitopes on tbp <dig>  and show a similar staining of tbp <dig> on lampbrush chromosomes and cb . the recruitment of tbp <dig> to transcriptionally active chromosomal loops is in line with a major role of tbp <dig> in transcription initiation in oocytes.

tbp <dig> is recruited to promoters in oocytes
to characterize the binding of tbp <dig> at a higher resolution, promoter reporter constructs were injected into oocyte nuclei and analyzed by chip. as a control for the activity of these promoters we also performed chip with a pol-ii antibody. the results show that tbp <dig> is associated with these promoters . although the recruitment is variable, in all cases it is well above the recruitment to the background control  gene). furthermore, tbp <dig> recruitment correlates with the occupancy of pol-ii. tbp <dig> was also enriched on the endogenous amplified 5s rrna loci which recruited very little pol-ii, as expected for rna polymerase-iii promoters.

to further confirm the association of tbp <dig> with promoters in oocytes, we expressed an ha-tagged version of tbp <dig> in oocytes and tested the recruitment of tbp <dig> on these promoters with an anti-ha antibody. oocytes injected with promoter constructs but lacking ha-tbp <dig> were used as a negative control. a similar pattern of recruitment was obtained . together, these chip results show that tbp <dig> is recruited to pol-ii and pol-iii promoters in oocytes.

role of tbp <dig> in tata box-dependent transcription in oocytes
in order to further assess the role of tbp <dig> in oocyte transcription functionally, we applied an altered binding specificity mutant reporter system  <cit> . in this system, three point mutations in the carboxy terminal domain of tbp confer the ability to bind to a mutated tata box  to which wild-type  protein cannot bind. we introduced these altered binding specificity  mutations in xenopus tbp and tbp <dig>  an emsa was performed to assess the binding specificity of wt and abs-mutant tbp and tbp <dig>  to this end, rabbit reticulocyte extracts containing in vitro-translated wt and abs-mutant versions of tbp or tbp <dig> were tested against regular and mutant tata probes from the adenovirus major late promoter  <cit> . like tbp, both wt and abs-mutant tbp <dig> proteins bind to a regular tata box, whereas only the abs-mutant proteins bind to the altered tata box .

next, we analyzed the behaviour of these proteins in oocyte transcription, for which we made use of the hsp <dig> promoter, which is known to be active in xenopus oocytes and has a canonical tata box upstream of its transcription start site  <cit> . the tata box of this promoter was mutated to tgta. wild-type and the mutant promoters were injected in the oocytes with and without mrna encoding tbp-abs or tbp2-abs . mutation of the tata box reduces transcription from this promoter, although some transcription persists . in the presence of tbp2-abs, transcription from the tgta promoter is rescued. in contrast, wt tbp <dig> is unable to promote transcription from the tgta promoter, confirming that the rescue is specifically carried out by the exogenously provided abs-mutant proteins. interestingly, tbp-abs, when expressed in oocytes, also rescues the transcription to the same extent  whereas the levels of exogenous abs proteins in both cases are comparable .

we also tested the x. tropicalis zfp36l <dig> promoter, which has a canonical tata box positioned  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site. we generated the tgta mutant of this promoter and used it to test the activity of tbp and tbp <dig> on this promoter. the tgta mutation significantly reduces transcription from this promoter . both tbp-abs and tbp2-abs can rescue transcription, with tbp2-abs being slightly more efficient than tbp in this regard .

collectively, our findings show that tbp can substitute for tbp <dig> if provided artificially to the oocyte core transcription machinery. on the hsp <dig> and zfp36l <dig> promoters, the relative expression levels of tbp and tbp <dig> appear to be a major determinant of initiation factor substitution. to analyze the behaviour of tbp and tbp <dig> on promoters lacking a tata box, we examined the recruitment of exogenously provided ha-tbp and ha-tbp <dig> on two tata-less promoters  and two tata box-containing promoters . oocytes injected with promoter constructs but lacking ha-tbp/ <dig> were used as a negative control. furthermore, a background control construct  was injected. the results substantiate the notion that tbp, if ectopically expressed, can be recruited to these promoters in oocytes .

loss of tbp2-promoter association during meiotic maturation
in addition to degrading tbp <dig>  maturing oocytes globally repress transcription. this prompted us to ask whether the downregulation of tbp <dig> may be important for proper shut down of transcription as oocytes mature into eggs. this is conceivable because tbp levels are extremely rate-limiting for transcription in egg extracts, and precocious transcription can be induced in embryos before gene activation at the mid-blastula transition by simultaneous inhibition of chromatin assembly with competitor dna and premature accumulation of tbp  <cit> . to test this possibility, we overexpressed tbp <dig> in maturing oocytes. when tbp <dig> is overexpressed before maturation, the levels are also elevated after maturation . therefore, stage vi oocytes were injected with two different concentrations of tbp <dig> mrna. the transcriptional shut-down was investigated on two distinct promoter constructs injected into oocytes either alone or in combination with high amounts of competitor dna . the results show that repression of transcription was established even in the presence of highly abundant tbp <dig> in maturing oocytes . the overexpression of tbp <dig> or presence of competitor dna, alone or in combination, had little if any effect on the repression of transcription.

to further examine this situation we compared the timing of tbp <dig> degradation and the shutdown of transcription. due to the variability between individual oocytes to undergo gvbd, batches of oocytes were synchronized depending on the appearance of the maturation mark at gvbd, and the promoter association of pol-ii and tbp <dig> was determined by chip at gvbd and  <dig> hr after gvbd . the results indicate that the repression of transcription is already established at gvbd, a point at which tbp <dig> degradation has not yet initiated. these observations  rule out a causative role for tbp <dig> degradation in the global shutdown of transcription during oocyte maturation, suggesting that the primary role of tbp <dig> degradation is to facilitate initiation factor switching during subsequent development. not tbp <dig> degradation but rather a loss of tbp <dig> association with the promoter coincides with transcriptional repression during meiotic maturation.

discussion
tbp2: the major tata binding factor in oocyte transcription
in the present study we show that xenopus oocytes lack any detectable tbp, whereas tbp <dig> is abundant in oocytes. in eggs and early embryos relatively low levels of tbp <dig> are present. tbp starts to accumulate after meiotic maturation and during cleavage stages of development . a similar expression profile of tbp and tbp <dig> has been observed in mouse oocytes  <cit> , which suggests a major role for tbp <dig> in oocyte transcription. indeed, tbp <dig> is recruited to the transcriptionally active loops of lampbrush chromosomes . in addition, tbp <dig> also appears to be a part of cbs and bss, which are considered to be involved in preassembly of transcription complexes  <cit> . the association of tbp <dig> with active promoters was further confirmed by chip on gv-injected promoters and on endogenous 5s rrna . surrounding follicle cells outnumber the oocytes; therefore it is not possible to perform chip on single copy loci in oocytes. due to this limitation, injected promoter constructs were used to model oocyte transcription. this system has been used effectively to study the biochemistry of chromatin assembly and transcription during oogenesis and early embryogenesis  <cit> . in order to examine the activity of tbp <dig> in oocytes, we utilized an altered binding specificity  mutant reporter system  <cit> . it cannot be ruled out that endogenous tbp <dig> behaves differently compared with its overexpressed abs mutant. however, the involvement of tbp <dig> in pol-ii mediated transcription in oocytes may be inferred from the ability of abs-tbp <dig> to rescue the deleterious effects of tgta promoter mutations, probably due to binding of abs-tbp <dig> to the tgta sequence to which the endogenous tbp <dig> cannot bind . these findings are congruous with the observation that only tbp <dig> is present in frog and mouse oocytes with no detectable tbp, which reinforces the notion that germ cell transcription is different from that of somatic cells  <cit> .

tbp <dig> degradation and its biological significance
we have found that during later stages of meiotic maturation tbp <dig> protein is actively degraded . this could potentially achieve two biological goals. first, it might be essential for proper shutdown of global transcription. in early embryos, transcriptional repression can be perturbed by premature accumulation of tbp together with disruption of chromatin assembly  <cit> . second, this degradation of tbp <dig> in combination with the translational upregulation of tbp in embryos might be a mechanism to achieve switching of tata binding factors between the oocyte and embryonic and/or somatic transcription machineries. the results of our experiments do not support a role for tbp <dig> degradation in the shutdown of transcription as it occurs even in the presence of abundant tbp <dig> , although a redundant role in transcriptional repression cannot be excluded. furthermore, transcriptional repression is already established before tbp <dig> is degraded . tbp <dig> degradation is likely to be a mechanism that brings about the switching of tata binding core transcription factors, facilitating the transition from a germ cell transcription apparatus to a somatic transcription machinery. however, this switching is not yet complete in early embryos because of low levels of tbp <dig>  as discussed below.

the transcription machinery is highly flexible
the altered binding specificity mutant of tbp, when expressed in the oocytes, could also promote transcription from the hsp- <dig> and zfp36l <dig> promoters . earlier observations indicated that tbp and tbp <dig> can replace each other in initiating basal transcription in vitro as well as in complexes with tfiia/alf and dna  <cit> . intriguingly, many promoters that exclusively require tbp in embryos are also maternally expressed  <cit> . tbp protein, however, is not present in oocytes where these maternal transcripts were initially made, implying an initiation factor switching on these promoters between oocytes and early embryos. furthermore, tbp <dig> overexpression in tbp knockdown embryos significantly, although not completely, rescued the phenotype of tbp ablation  <cit> . on a similar note, it has been proposed that in cells heterozygous for tbp , elevated levels of tbp <dig> compensate abnormally low levels of tbp at some but not all promoters  <cit> . this shows that on many promoters the two tata binding proteins can act redundantly.

a complicating matter is that both tbp and tbp <dig> are required for early development in fish and frog  <cit> , and promoters that strictly require either tbp or tbp <dig> in embryos have been identified  <cit> . the molecular basis of tbp-tbp <dig> selectivity remains to be elucidated. the embryonic transcription machinery  is not yet fully switched to the common somatic machinery , effectively leaving tbp and tbp <dig> to compete for interactions with embryonic activators and promoter elements. paradoxically, despite the relatively low levels of tbp <dig> in embryos, many genes depend on this factor, whereas ablation of tbp causes relatively moderate effects on gene expression  <cit> . tbp <dig> may be competitive in embryonic gene regulation because of preferential interactions with embryonic activators or other maternal factors that – like tbp <dig> – still persist in early development; such preferential interactions would be analogous to the preference of the caudal activator for a promoter nucleoprotein architecture with the downstream promoter element  <cit> . for example, tbp <dig> preferentially accommodates activation of vertebrate-specific embryonic and ventral-specific genes  <cit> . during later development, core factor switching may be completed when tbp <dig> levels further decline  <cit> .

on the limited number of promoters tested in this study, tbp and tbp <dig> could replace each other depending on their relative expression levels, providing an experimental model for initiation factor switching. our data suggest that the core transcription machinery is highly flexible and that changes in relative expression levels of tata binding factors between oocytes and embryos can drive core factor switching. based on these observations we propose a model  according to which the core factor switching that occurs at many maternal-embryonic promoters is brought about by active degradation of tbp <dig>  followed by regulated translation of maternal stores of tbp mrna before the onset of embryonic transcription at the mid-blastula transition   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our observations not only establish an important role of tbp <dig> in transcription of a highly specialized cell type which lacks any detectable tbp, but also provide evidence that the basal transcription machinery is highly flexible and can rapidly exchange factors depending on their expression. this leads to initiation factor switching on a subset of promoters that are active both in oocytes and embryos, whereas other promoters show factor selectivity, which accounts for their non-redundant function in early embryos  <cit> .
