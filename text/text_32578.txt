BACKGROUND
cells have developed a complex architecture that relies on the compartmentalization of cellular functions within organelles that are bounded by lipid membranes. the plasma membrane constitutes a unique interface between the cytoplasm and extra cellular milieu. while ensuring the physical separation of two very different environments, a constant communication between the cell and its extracellular milieu is established by means of cell surface proteins. signaling via membrane proteins regulate various cellular functions including cell survival, cell propagation, cell differentiation and cell migration. therefore membrane proteins are considered prime targets for drugs designed to combat cancer and other diseases. while inhibition of a given cell surface receptor often leads to predictable changes in cells based on the signaling cascade initiated by the receptor, it is unclear how altering cell signaling via a number of receptors would change the cell physiology.

ina is a hydrophobic photo-reactive probe that reacts with transmembrane anchors of membrane proteins upon photo-activation with uv light  <cit> . ina has been used for the labeling and identification of integral membrane proteins  <cit> , in the study of membrane dynamics and fusion  <cit>  and for the detection of protein-membrane interactions  <cit> . recently, we have utilized the transmembrane protein anchor reactivity of ina for inactivation of enveloped viruses  <cit>  with preservation of structural integrity for vaccine application. when applied to a variety of enveloped viruses, ina could selectively eliminate functions associated with the hydrophobic domain of the viral envelope required for inducing membrane fusion  <cit> . based on this premise we hypothesized that treatment of cancer cells with ina-uv would result in inactivation of signaling functions of cellular membrane proteins which in turn would inhibit cell signaling and survival.

with this in mind we conducted the present study to show that ina, a non toxic compound in itself, is highly toxic to a variety of tumor cells including multidrug resistant cells in the presence of uv light. treatment of cells with ina-uv resulted in inhibition of signal transduction by certain cellular receptors and cell death. the cell death induced by ina-uv showed signs of a classical apoptosis pathway with the involvement of caspases. this study provides evidence that ina can act as a novel and highly active therapeutic agent with a mechanism of action that seems distinct from existing photodynamic therapy compounds.

RESULTS
photo-activation of ina inhibits cell viability
ina is a hydrophobic compound that partitions in the membrane of cells. upon irradiation of cells with uv light  the azido moiety is converted into a highly reactive nitrene that covalently binds membrane proteins. this process leads to the selective inactivation of functions associated with those proteins in the hydrophobic domain of the membrane as has been previously shown for isolated cell membranes  <cit>  and enveloped viruses  <cit> . in this study, we examined the effect of ina-uv on the viability and membrane associated functions of different tumor cell lines. we treated a human breast cancer cell line mcf <dig> with varying concentrations of ina and irradiated with uv light. as seen in figure 1a, treatment of cells with ina-uv caused significant inhibition of cell viability determined by mts assay. in the absence of light ina was non toxic to the cells. the effect of ina-uv was dose dependent with ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm for mcf <dig> cells . the ability of ina-uv treatment to cause cell death was not limited to mcf <dig> cells. similar results were obtained with a variety of other cancer cell lines representing cervical cancer, glioma, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma and lymphoblastoma .

* seven independent measurements were performed and analyzed together. ic <dig> values were computed by fitting a four-parameter nonlinear regression model with r statistical software  <cit> . the standard error  represents the 95% confidence interval.

photo-activation of ina induces apoptosis
next we asked whether the loss of viability seen by ina-uv treatment was due to apoptosis induced in these cells. apoptosis is characterized by a variety of distinct cellular changes like phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial depolarization and dna fragmentation. mcf <dig> cells treated with various concentrations of ina-uv were analyzed for apoptosis markers like mitochondrial depolarization using dioc <dig> dye  or phosphatidylserine exposure via annexin v staining . a dose dependent induction of apoptosis was seen in these cells. to further characterize whether the cells were undergoing apoptosis we used the tunel assay to detect dna fragmentation. as seen in figure 2c the cells treated with ina-uv also showed dna fragmentation confirming the apoptotic mechanism of cell death.

apoptosis mediated by ina-uv is caspase dependent
caspases are cysteine proteases that are key mediators of apoptosis  <cit> . the involvement of caspases in the apoptotic pathway can be studied by the inhibition of apoptosis via the pan-caspase inhibitor z-val-ala-asp-fluoromethylketone  and the cleavage of caspase specific substrates like parp  <cit> . to determine whether apoptosis mediated via ina-uv treatment was caspase dependent, we treated supt <dig> cells with zvadfmk  prior to ina-uv treatment. as seen in figure 3a and 3b ina-uv mediated apoptosis at low concentrations was inhibited by zvadfmk confirming the role of caspases. interestingly higher concentrations were not inhibited by zvadfmk suggesting a different mechanism at very high concentrations. in order to monitor caspase activation in supt <dig> cells  <dig> h post treatment with ina-uv, the cells were labeled fitc-vad-fmk which binds irreversibly with active caspases and analyzed by flow cytometry. as seen in figure 3c, high activation of caspases is observed at  <dig> μm which correspond to the ic <dig> of ina-uv treatment of supt <dig> cells. the activation of caspases was lower at higher doses as determined by fitc-vad-fmk staining. these findings are supported by the high levels of parp cleavage seen at low ina concentrations whereas there was little parp cleavage at higher ina concentrations . parp cleavage was prevented at all ina concentrations by zvadfmk indicating its caspase specificity . to generalize our conclusion about mechanisms of cell killing, we performed similar experiments with hela cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  the major caspase involvement in hela cells takes place at  <dig> μm ina. at higher ina concentrations zvadfmk becomes inefficient in preventing apoptosis  and parp cleavage is decreased . the enhanced caspase activity was observed at  <dig> μm ina for supt <dig> cells and  <dig> μm ina for hela cells, which corresponds in each case to the ic <dig> at which ina causes cell death following photo-activation. these studies therefore suggest that in the ic <dig> range of concentrations of ina the apoptosis is mediated by caspases. however, at higher ina concentrations a caspase-independent apoptotic process may be involved.

ina-uv induced cell killing is not affected by multidrug resistance proteins
an important problem that arises during chemotherapy is the emergence of drug resistant cells  <cit> . a major contributor of that phenomenon is an increased efflux of the drugs facilitated by proteins such as the p-glycoprotein  or the multidrug resistance protein   <cit> . to test whether ina was affected by this phenomenon we used 293/mrp <dig> cells, a stably transfected  <dig> cell line that continuously expresses the mrp <dig> gene at high levels  <cit> . indeed, those cell lines exhibited a much lower sensitivity to the commonly used chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin . however, the ic <dig> of ina-uv cell killing was insensitive to the presence of the multidrug resistance associated gene mrp <dig> . similarly, ina-uv treatment was not significantly affected by pgp over-expression .

ina-uv treatment blocks the mrp <dig> induced efflux
mrp <dig> is a complex transmembrane protein with  <dig> membrane spanning domains that mediates efflux of various substrates from the cytoplasm of the cell to the extracellular milieu. calcein is an anionic fluorescent probe that acts as a substrate for mrp <dig> and determination of its cellular accumulation and efflux allows the investigation of mrp <dig> activity  <cit> . as observed in figure 6a, after one hour incubation at 37°c, the  <dig> cells expressing mrp <dig> have released a significant portion of the entrapped calcein as evident from the lower fluorescence seen by flow cytometry. this efflux was prevented by incubation of the cells with verapamil , an inhibitor of mrp <dig> function, yielding a labeling efficiency with calcein similar to the one obtained with  <dig> that do not express mrp <dig> . interestingly pre-treatment of the 293/mrp <dig> cells with ina-uv induced a similar block in mrp <dig> function as observed with verapamil . on the other hand, in control cells lacking mrp <dig> neither verapamil nor ina-uv treatment had any significant effect on calcein efflux . this suggests that the increase in calcein labeling in ina-uv treated mrp <dig> positive cells was in fact due to a specific inhibition of mrp <dig> function. this is consistent with the inactivation of transmembrane proteins by ina labeling.

ina-uv affects cxcr <dig> signaling
cxcr <dig> is a seven transmembrane g protein-coupled chemokine receptor that is over-expressed in a variety of tumors and involved in tumor metastasis  <cit> . in cell membranes, blocking the signaling by ina-uv treatment of another g protein-coupled receptor, human chorionic gonadotropin  has been previously documented  <cit> . we wished to determine whether ina-uv treatment would alter signaling via cxcr <dig>  binding of the cxcr <dig> ligand sdf-1α to its receptor induces a calcium flux in cells, which is monitored by ratio of fluorescent signals at  <dig> and  <dig> nm excitation, respectively, and  <dig> nm emission using the fluorescent calcium indicator dye, fura  <dig> pre-loaded into the cells  <cit> . upon addition of sdf1α we observed calcium flux in the control supt <dig> cells but not in cells pretreated with ina-uv  suggesting an inhibition of cxcr <dig> signaling. by contrast, ina-uv treatment had no effect on the action of the calcium ionophore 4-bromo a- <dig> that directly mediates calcium flux across membranes. when added to supt <dig>  in both cases the cytosolic concentration of calcium rose to a similar level as was shown by the increase of the fura  <dig> ratio signal . hence the effect of ina-uv was at the level of cxcr <dig> signaling and not a general effect on intracellular calcium accumulation.

ina-uv does not inhibit igf <dig> signaling
growth factor receptors including egfr and igf1r are often overexpressed in tumor cells. overexpression of igf1r is associated with increased survival and proliferation of tumor cells. hence we wished to determine whether ina-uv had an effect on igf1r signaling and whether it was related to the apoptosis seen in previous experiments. the binding of igf <dig> to its receptor activates the pi3kinase pathway leading to akt phosphorylation at serine  <dig>  <cit> , which has been reported to be involved in apoptosis inhibition. as can be seen on figure  <dig>  the pretreatment of mcf <dig> cells with ina-uv leads to an amplification of akt phosphorylation induced by igf <dig> compared to untreated cells. while dmso partially contributed to this effect, further amplification was observed upon irradiation in the presence of ina. interestingly we observe that ina-uv treatment alone, in the absence of igf <dig>  can partially induce akt phosphorylation in mcf <dig> cells. this effect requires the reaction to transmembrane proteins with ina, since it is not observed with uv and dmso treatment alone. these results suggest that ina-uv may in fact activate signaling via igf1r contrary to the results seen with other receptors. these results underscore the complex physiological outcome of ina interaction with cellular receptors and the diversity in the signal transduction mechanism by different receptors.

treatment affects the mobility of membrane proteins
our efforts to identify the mechanism of action of ina-uv mediated apoptosis induction suggest a direct effect on membrane proteins. although cxcr <dig> and mrp <dig> functions were inhibited by ina-uv treatment, this was not the case with igf1r function. photoactivation of ina results in the covalent binding of the probe to membrane proteins in the lipidic bilayer with no particular specificity. this may alter the function of proteins via a variety of mechanisms including the translational mobility of receptors in the plasma membrane. hence we sought to assess the effects of ina modifications on the mobility of membrane proteins using ccr5-gfp as a reporter. frap  is a commonly used method to detect the mobility of fluorescently tagged protein and lipids in cells. we transiently expressed ccr5-gfp in hela cells and performed frap measurements with or without ina-uv treatment. as shown in figure  <dig> there is a dramatic impact of ina-uv treatment on fluorescence recovery of ccr5-gfp. curve-fitting recovery after photobleaching shows that ina-uv treatment greatly affects the mobile fraction of ccr5-gfp molecules . ina-uv treatment results in the immobilization of ccr5-gfp while the effect on the mobility of lipids is not significant  <cit> . these results suggest that ina via direct interaction with transmembrane protein alters the function and mobility of various cellular receptors.

discussion
ina is a highly hydrophobic molecule that partitions with high specificity in cellular membranes  <cit> . this high hydrophobicity along with its photoactivable property makes it a specific probe for transmembrane anchors of membrane proteins. we have exploited this specificity towards transmembrane anchors to inactivate a variety of viral membrane proteins for design of new vaccine candidates  <cit> . in this study we studied the effects of ina-uv treatment on whole cells. our results indicate that treatment of cell lines with ina by itself was non toxic; however, in the presence of uv light the treatment mediated loss in viability of numerous cancer cells.

the photoactivation of ina is mediated by its azido group that is sensitive to uv irradiation. upon uv irradiation, a highly reactive nitrene radical is formed that covalently reacts with transmembrane proteins in its vicinity  <cit> . such covalent modifications of proteins has been shown to result in the complete loss of infectivity of several enveloped viruses  <cit>  and correlates with the loss of membrane fusion function of the viral fusion proteins  <cit> . the transmembrane segments of the fusion proteins of retroviruses  <cit>  and influenza virus  <cit>  are indeed critical for the full fusion process to take place. although replacement of the transmembrane anchor of influenza virus hemagglutinin with a lipid-anchor obliterated its full fusion capacity, the lipid-anchored hemagglutinin still promoted the hemifusion phenotype leading to the mixing of the outer layers of the viral and target cell membranes  <cit> . consistent with this, ina-uv treatment of influenza preserved the hemifusion phenotype confirming the requirement of the transmembrane anchor for full fusion activity and the specific effect of ina on the transmembrane anchor without effecting the function of extracellular domains  <cit> .

treatment of cells with ina and uv irradiation resulted in complete loss of viability in a variety of cancer cell lines . this effect was shown to be dependent on the concentration of ina used and strictly required activation by uv light . we show here that ina activation induces cell death via characteristics of apoptosis as determined by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, phosphatidyl serine presentation, parp cleavage and dna fragmentation in treated cells. at lower doses of ina, apoptosis could be reversed by zvadfmk, a potent pan caspases inhibitor. caspase activation was also detected by fitc-vad-fmk  <dig> h post ina-uv treatment showing the involvement of caspases in this process and confirming the apoptotic pathway. however, at higher concentrations of ina, caspase activation is decreased and accordingly zvadfmk becomes ineffective in preventing mitochondrial depolarization and ps presentation suggesting a caspase independent pathway of apoptosis as seen with other treatments like hexaminolevulinate pdt of lymphoma cells  <cit> . a caspase independent cell death referred to as sub apoptosis has been previously documented  <cit> . the death inducing stimulus might be such that apoptosis can be achieved through release of apoptosis inducing factors  from mitochondria without the participation of caspases  <cit> .

as the dosage of ina is increased, more targets within the transmembrane region and possibly other membrane compartments are likely to be reached by the treatment and this can alter the mechanisms inducing the death of the treated cells. if activated ina will covalently react with any protein that is deeply anchored in the lipid bilayer, the consequence of this covalent modification will depend on the function of this portion of the particular protein. understanding the effect of ina on cellular proteins is important for determining the mechanism of apoptosis induction by ina and its development as an anti cancer agent.

it has been previously reported that ina-uv treatment of cell membranes induces inactivation of gonadotropin receptor by uncoupling of the response of adenylate cyclase to gonadotropins  <cit> . while binding of chorionic gonadotropin and the luteinizing hormone to gonadotropin receptor were preserved, the binding failed to induce stimulation of the adenylate cyclase pathway. on the other hand, this pathway was shown to be still functional when stimulated directly with naf. the luteineizing hormone receptor is a member of the g protein-coupled receptor, a family of receptors displaying seven predicted transmembrane helices. cxcr <dig>  another member of this family, has recently been shown to be overexpressed in many cancer cell lines  <cit> . this overexpression is largely due to the hypoxic conditions in the tumor environment  <cit>  and can favor the metastasis of cancer cells through its ligand sdf1α  <cit> . we show here that ina-uv treatment blocks cxcr <dig> mediated calcium signaling generated by sdf1α stimulation. at the same time the calcium gradient is preserved in the ina-uv treated cells as it is still sensitive to the effect of calcium ionophores indicating that the integrity of the treated cell membranes is not compromised. these data indicate a direct inactivation of cxcr <dig> receptor signaling by ina-uv treatment.

similarly, the activity of mrp <dig> a member of the abc transporters superfamily that along with pgp is involved in the drug resistance phenotype in various cancers  <cit>  was also affected by ina-uv treatment. although no crystal structure is yet available for this protein, abc transporters are thought to be composed of clusters of predicted transmembrane helices  <cit> . overexpression of drug resistance genes makes cells several orders of magnitudes less sensitive to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. the mechanism of action is not clearly understood but the working hypothesis of "hydrophobic vacuum cleaner" has been proposed  <cit>  whereby the hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents while partitioning into the membrane will interact with the transporter within the lipid domain of the bilayer and be pumped outwards. the ability of ina to covalently react with members of abc transporters has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . we show here that this interaction leads to the inhibition of mrp <dig> function and drug efflux. our data indicate that cell killing induced by irradiation at given concentrations of ina is not affected by the presence of mrp <dig> or pgp. although ina labeling of mrp <dig> has previously been demonstrated  <cit> , the lack of difference in ic <dig> for ina killing between mrp1+ and mrp1- cells suggests that either ina is not a substrate for mrp <dig> or that the kd for ina binding to mrp <dig> is much higher than the ic <dig> for ina to kill cells by irradiation. therefore irradiation in the presence of ina, and possibly other hydrophobic alkylating agents, appears to be an effective modality of killing of multi-drug resistant cells.

growth receptor signaling via igf1r and egfr has been known to induce cell survival and proliferation in cancer cells via activation of the pi3kinase and akt pathway. the tyrosine kinase igf1r mediated akt phosphorylation was not affected by ina treatment in cells incubated with igf <dig>  interestingly, increased levels of akt phosphorylation were observed in ina treated cells in the absence of igf <dig> stimulation, which was further enhanced upon incubation with igf <dig>  this suggests that ina treatment may activate igf1r consistent with reports that a mutation in the transmembrane anchor of igf1r can result in activation of the receptor  <cit> . the effects of ina can be interpreted through intramolecular effects via the chemical modification introduced by the covalent addition of a hydrophobic moiety in the transmembrane segment of a protein. however protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions are also likely to be affected by this modification. proper signaling within cells relies on a dynamic reorganization upon stimuli of the signaling receptors within different domains of the membrane that are thought to assemble and disassemble for the signaling to proceed  <cit> . we show here by frap analysis that ina-uv treatment considerably reduces the mobile fraction of proteins within plasma membranes. whether this is due to a partial aggregation of membrane proteins and/or a reorganization of domains to accommodate the enhanced hydrophobicity needs to be further studied. the enhanced basal activation of akt following ina and light treatment might also be a result of receptor immobilization/redistribution. furthermore, the ability of igf <dig> to stimulate the tyrosine kinase igf1r receptor is considerably amplified by ina treatment. igf1r has been shown to relocalize in membrane "raft" microdomains in mcf <dig> cells upon stimulation with igf <dig>  <cit>  and activation of akt also appears to rely on its membrane redistribution  <cit>  in membrane "raft" microdomains  <cit> . nevertheless akt activation induced by ina treatment does not prevent the cells to undergo apoptosis suggesting the mechanism of cell death induced by ina is independent of akt signaling pathway.

in this report we show the potency of ina as a novel and efficient photoactivable chemotherapeutic agent. the activity of this treatment is strictly dependent on activation by uv light and is mediated by the covalent reaction of ina with membrane embedded domains of proteins. unlike conventional photodynamic sensitizer that are dependent on reactive oxygen species for activity, reaction of ina with membrane proteins has been shown to be increased under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . such hypoxic conditions are common in tumors micro environment and present a major challenge for other photosensitizers. furthermore, while ina can be directly activated by uv, an equivalent activation can be obtained through energy transfer processes called photosensitization using a variety of chromophores as photosensitizers  <cit> . the result presented here show that ina is a very potent light activatable therapeutic agent whose targets and mechanism of action are very different from existing pdt agents. those properties of ina make it a unique candidate for use in photoactivated cancer chemotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS
while ina by itself is innocuous to cells, ina-uv treatment profoundly affects the physiology of various cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis. the covalent binding of ina to transmembrane domains of proteins alters the signaling capabilities of various cellular receptors in a complex fashion. while g protein-coupled receptors are completely inactivated, the igf <dig> receptor remains sensitive to igf <dig> stimulation. the translational diffusion of proteins is also profoundly affected by ina-uv treatment. interestingly, ina is not a substrate for the major multi drug resistance proteins pgp and mrp <dig>  furthermore, we show that ina-uv can prevent the efflux capability of mrp <dig>  overall, the photoactivation of ina in cells results in a dose dependent apoptosis that can be exploited in anti-cancer treatment.
