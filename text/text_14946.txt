BACKGROUND
clostridium botulinum is an important pathogen as it forms the highly potent botulinum neurotoxin that is responsible for botulism. it is a physiologically and genetically heterogeneous species within which four metabolically and genetically distinct groups are recognised  <cit> . cases of human botulism are usually associated with group i or group ii strains. group i  c. botulinum is a mesophilic bacterium with a minimum growth temperature of 10-12°c, an optimum of 37°c and maximum growth temperature of around 48°c. it is highly proteolytic, forms very heat resistant spores and strains form one, or occasionally two, neurotoxins of types a, b or f. group ii  c. botulinum is a psychrotrophic bacterium with a minimum growth temperature of  <dig> - <dig> °c and an optimum of 30°c. it ferments a number of sugars, forms spores with moderate heat resistance, and strains form a single neurotoxin of type b, e, or f  <cit> . group ii c. botulinum is often associated with outbreaks of foodborne botulism involving fish and meat  <cit>  and is a concern in the continued safe production of chilled ready meals  <cit> .

the variability and relationships between strains, and particularly between the different toxin serotypes, within group ii c. botulinum are not well understood. several authors have used a range of methods to type c. botulinum including 16s rrna  <cit> , aflp  <cit> , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   <cit> , randomly amplified polymorphic dna   <cit>  and ribotyping  <cit> . however, these studies have either concentrated on the genetic diversity of the entire c. botulinum species or diagnostic subtyping of closely related strains. more recently macdonald et al.  <cit>  used mlst, aflp, vntr and sequencing of the neurotoxin gene to examine the relationships between  <dig> type e strains. none of these studies have included more than a total of six strains of either type b or type f.

hyyatia et al.  <cit>  tested  <dig> strains of group ii c. botulinum including  <dig> type b,  <dig> type f and  <dig> type e in an rapd and rep-pcr analysis, and kirkwood et al.  <cit>  included  <dig> type b,  <dig> type f and  <dig> types e strains in their focal plane array fourier transform infrared  and pfge analysis, but both these papers were aimed at diagnostic subtyping rather than extending understanding of strain variability.

the aim of the present study was to improve understanding of the diversity and clustering of strains of group ii c. botulinum by examining both the genomics and the physiology of strains. we analysed a newly sequenced genome and compared it with other genomes of group ii c. botulinum that are publically available. we have also constructed a microarray suitable for comparative genomics based on the sequence of group ii c. botulinum eklund 17b , and used this to carry out the first reported comparative genomic indexing study of group ii c. botulinum which included  <dig> type b,  <dig> type e and  <dig> type f strains. physiological analyses have included measurement of the maximum nacl concentration and minimum temperature permitting growth as well as carbohydrate utilisation and tellurite resistance.

RESULTS
sequence data
the genome features of group ii c. botulinum eklund 17b  are shown in table  <dig>  the genome of strain eklund 17b  consists of a chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp and a plasmid of  <dig>  bp. the chromosome carries  <dig>  coding sequences and has a gc content of 27%. the plasmid carries  <dig> coding sequences and has a gc content of 25%.

comparison with a previously released eklund 17b genome sequence
during the sequencing and assembly of the eklund 17b  genome a complete finished sequence of another isolate of strain eklund 17b was made available by the joint genome institute, usa , accession number a <dig>  strain eklund 17b was originally isolated in  <dig> but the two sequenced isolates had been in separate laboratories for at least  <dig> years. genomic comparisons of the two sequences reveal a small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms ,  <dig> in total, in addition to some potential assembly differences . the potential assembly differences largely relate to the ribosomal rna operons. these repetitive and virtually identical regions are notoriously difficult to assemble and therefore the observed changes may represent differences in the assembly rather than differences in the target genomic dna sequence. the snps may have resulted from the use of different platforms, methodologies and software, however, it cannot be ruled out that genetic changes have occurred during the period of separation.

genome comparisons with other group ii c. botulinum strains
only two additional whole genome sequences of group ii c. botulinum strains are currently available in the sequence databases. these are type e <dig> toxin producing strain alaska e <dig> and type e <dig> toxin producing strain beluga, accession numbers nc_ <dig> and acsc <dig> respectively. the sequences for strain alaska e <dig> is finished to completion, while the sequence for strain beluga is a draft assembly comprising six contigs. the available group ii c. botulinum genomes were downloaded and used in downstream analysis of the eklund 17b  genome.

cdss shared between strains eklund 17b , alaska e <dig> and beluga were determined by reciprocal best match analysis. the general features of all three genomes are summarised in table  <dig> and a circular representation of the genome showing orthologous genes shared between the strains is shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows specific regions of variability amongst the strains, which may represent insertions into the backbone dna of the organism.

phage dna was modelled by the phast program  <cit> . four intact prophages were predicted in the eklund 17b  genome. these were designated as sharing the highest similarity with geobacillus virus e <dig>  clostridium phage Φ <dig>  clostridium phage Φcd <dig> and clostridium phage Φcd <dig>  an additional potential prophage was described as questionable but sharing the highest similarity with clostridium phage Φcd <dig>  in comparison, alaska e <dig> was predicted to possess only one intact phage region; this was located at a similar genetic position to the phage predicted as questionable in eklund 17b . by contrast the beluga genome was predicted to contain three large intact prophages, one of which shares the highest similarity with clostridium phage Φcd <dig> and which is present in a similar genetic position to the equivalent prophage in eklund 17b . the other two predicted beluga prophages were present at different positions to those in eklund 17b . at approximately  <dig> , <dig> bp in the eklund 17b  genome, there are a number of cdss for phage proteins that are shared with beluga but not with alaska e <dig>  these do not constitute an intact prophage in either eklund 17b  or beluga.

regions that were unique to the eklund 17b  genome but were not associated with phage were also detected. many of these regions carry cdss for enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, regulators and transporters. other regions specify cell envelope components. specific unique cdss include cold shock and heat shock proteins. a cds for a predicted protein with similarity to an endolysin from c. beijerinckii, a septicolysin similar to that from c. septicum and a cds sharing significant similarity with an internalin from listeria ivanovii is also present. a venn diagram was formulated to represent the number of cds shared between the three sequenced group ii c. botulinum strains and the numbers of unique cds . a total of  <dig> cds were common to all three strains out of a total of between  <dig> and  <dig> cds .

features of plasmid pcll
the genome of eklund 17b  includes one plasmid which carries the genes of the toxin cluster. the plasmid features are described figure  <dig>  there are two conserved botulinum neurotoxin cluster types, the ha cluster and the orfx cluster  <cit> . the toxin gene clusters from group ii c.botulinum type b strain eklund 17b  and type e strain alaska e <dig>  are shown in figure  <dig> illustrating the typical organisation of the ha cluster and orfx cluster types respectively. the toxin gene of c.botulinum eklund 17b  is in a ha cluster that sits adjacent to a resolvase-recombinase that may be significant in the lateral gene transfer of this cluster to alternative plasmid and chromosomal locations. specific features of the plasmid include plasmid replication and maintenance cdss and several conserved hypothetical cdss of similar length. blast analysis shows that, for the most part, these cdss only show significant sequence similarity to the equivalent genes from eklund 17b . these cdss do not show any conserved pfam domain features or predicted transmembrane domains. repeat analysis using the program reputer  <cit>  does not indicate that these genetic regions are highly repetitive, although repeats are detectable on the plasmid.

comparative genomic indexing of strains using microarray
the dna microarray used for competitive genomic indexing in this study comprised  <dig> probes. each was sixty nucleotides long and tested by blast analysis to bind to unique sites in the group ii c. botulinum eklund 17b  chromosome and plasmid sequences. these probes represented  <dig> chromosomal cdss and  <dig> plasmid cdss which is  <dig> % of the  <dig> total cdss that were predicted from the sequence data available at that time. this microarray was used to index the cds content of  <dig> strains of group ii c. botulinum in relation to the control eklund 17b  strain. the hybridization intensity ratio of genomic dna from the test strain hybridized against eklund 17b  dna for each cds in chromosome order is shown in figure  <dig>  the number of cdss where the test probe signal was within 8-fold of the control signal is shown in table  <dig> 

sixty-mer probes were used to represent  <dig> chromosomal sequences of eklund 17b  on a microarray. data show the number of these cdss found in each test strain by microarray analysis. cdss were considered to be present if the test probe signal was within 8-fold of the control probe signal and significantly above the background. nte= no toxin gene detected but strain originally isolated containing type e neurotoxin gene.

hierarchical clustering was performed to assess the genomic relatedness of the strains . the branch lengths represent the linkage distance between strains calculated using a pearson correlation pairwise comparison function. the clustering analysis divided group ii c. botulinum into three main clades using a distance marker of  <dig> . clade  <dig> included the control strain, eklund 17b , and three other type b strains. clade  <dig> contained the remainder of the type b strains and all the type f strains. all type e strains were together in clade  <dig> 

the four strains in clade  <dig> all scored positive for the same chromosomal cdss as the test eklund 17b  strain. three strains also contained the plasmid cds, including the toxin cluster, but these were not present in strain eklund 2b. as eklund 2b was initially able to produce toxin but did not contain the toxin genes sequence when tested on the microarray, it had presumably lost the plasmid during culture or preparation. this lack of the eklund 17b  plasmid cdss makes eklund 2b appear slightly separated from the other cluster  <dig> strains on the dendrogram . using only chromosomal probes, eklund 2b clustered with the other three strains in the eklund 17b  clade.

in general, no relationship was observed between the clades and geographical origin, environment, food type or isolation date. however, many pairs of strains were very similar to each other when compared to the genome of eklund 17b . in some cases these pairs of strains had been isolated in a short time from similar samples. for example, type b strains ifr 05/ <dig> and ifr 05/ <dig> were both isolated from egg pastas in  <dig>  type b strains eklund 17b and eklund 2b were both isolated from pacific sediment in  <dig>  and type b strains kapchunka b <dig> and kapchunka b <dig> were both isolated from salted fish  in  <dig>  in other cases strains from geographically and chronologically diverse isolations also appear similar such as type f strains craig  <dig> and hobbs ft <dig>  type e strains beluga and cb-k-37e, and type e strains dolman vh and prevot p <dig> .

c. botulinum neurotoxin gene subtyping and toxin cluster genes
the neurotoxin genes of c. botulinum are found in one of two conserved cluster types, the ha cluster and the orfx cluster  generally with a single neurotoxin gene per cluster. all the strains of group ii c. botulinum listed in table  <dig> were tested on a second microarray designed using probes to published ha cluster genes or orfx cluster genes. most of the available toxin cluster gene sequences available at that time were from group i or group iii c. botulinum species. unfortunately these probes were not particularly effective for binding the group ii c. botulinum strains used in this study and therefore could not be used to distinguishing between them. for example, although the type f toxin is associated with the orfx cluster, dna from group ii c. botulinum type f strains did not show strong binding to any of the orfx gene probes which were generated from group i toxin cluster sequences.

the neurotoxin gene of each test strain was subtyped by sequencing diagnostic regions of each toxin type. a single region, b <dig>  of the type b neurotoxin gene, predicted to be diagnostic for toxin subtype, was amplified by pcr and subjected to dna sequencing. after end trimming, the sequence subjected to clustalw analysis was  <dig> bp. the type b genes from the group ii strains studied here were all type b <dig> . the b <dig> toxin type is generally associated with group ii c. botulinum strains and includes eklund 17b . in clade  <dig>  eklund 17b  and its close relatives, the sequenced  <dig> bp diagnostic region of the type b toxin gene from eklund 2b and ifr05/ <dig> only differed from that of eklund 17b by  <dig> bp and strain colworth bl <dig> differed by  <dig> bp. the only two strains that had neurotoxin genes slightly diverged from others within the b <dig> group were kapchunka b <dig> and kapchunka b <dig>  which were identical in sequence to each other but which differed from the neurotoxin gene of their closest relative, eklund 17b , by  <dig> bp . this does not constitute the basis for a new subtype but marks these two strains as divergent. the greatest difference observed between the type b toxin nucleotide sequences of any two group i or group ii c. botulinum strains  and kapchunka b <dig> or kapchunka b5), represented  <dig> of  <dig> bp, equivalent to 7%.

two regions of the type e neurotoxin gene, predicted to be diagnostic for toxin subtype, were sequenced. after end trimming, the sequences for region estr <dig> were  <dig> bp, and those for estr <dig> were  <dig> bp. clustalw  analysis showed that each region distinguished some but not all of the subtypes; however combining both sets of data allowed an unambiguous interpretation. the type e strains were one of four toxin subtypes, e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> or e <dig> . no examples were found for subtypes e <dig> and e <dig>  which to date have only been described in strains of c. butyricum, nor for the more recently described subtypes e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> .

a single region of the type f neurotoxin gene was chosen for diagnostic sequencing. after end trimming this was  <dig>  bp long. all five type f strains contained neurotoxin genes encoding subtype f <dig>  pcr and subsequent dna sequencing of the region spanning the orfx2/p <dig> genes showed the two strains isolated from scallops in  <dig>  lacked the botr gene as has previously been shown for subtype f <dig> strain ibca66- <dig>  <cit> . pcr results suggest that botr is also missing from the toxin cluster of the three other type f strains isolated more than  <dig> years previously. all group ii c. botulinum strains contained a single neurotoxin gene, with no silent toxin genes identified.

clade specific cds and physiology
from the microarray data, one hundred and forty cdss were scored as present in clade  <dig> strains but absent in clade  <dig> and  <dig> strains using a pearson correlation cut-off of  <dig> . of these,  <dig> did not have a predicted function and were therefore annotated as either hypothetical or putative proteins. the five cdss with a strongly predicted function were abc transporter atp-binding protein , aspartyl-trna synthetase , two component response regulator , gnat-family acetyltransferase  and phage protein . thirteen putative bacteriophage genes were additionally detected. repeating the hierarchical clustering after removing cdss specific to clade  <dig> strains did not alter the way the clustering divided the strains into three clades. this suggests that the separation of the clade  <dig> strains was not solely dependent on the presence of common bacteriophage material in the strains in this clade.

the remaining type b strains were in clade  <dig> along with all the type f strains. these strains had chromosomal dna matching  <dig> to 87% of eklund 17b  cds probes. the type f strains were on a single branch but were as closely related to type b strains as some b strains were to each other. with the exception of the toxin cluster, there were no cdss common to all type b strains that were absent from all type f strains.

all the type e strains and no type b or f strains were in clade  <dig>  type e strains had chromosomal dna matching  <dig> to 78% of eklund 17b  cds probes. a total of  <dig> cdss present in all type b and type f strains were missing or diverged in all the type e strains using a pearson correlation cut-off of  <dig> .

care must be taken when interpreting microarray results since an absence of a signal indicates only that the sequence used for the probe was either missing or diverged. a strain that appeared to lack a cds on the microarray could have a similar sequence with nucleotide base changes in the probe area. similarly, variation in cds does not automatically mean there is variation at the protein level; as a result of codon redundancy the strains could be phenotypically similar without being genetically the same.

in order to predict physiological differences between strains in clades  <dig> and  <dig> and those in clade  <dig>  cdss specific to type b and type f strains were subjected to a tblastx search against the sequenced type e strain, c. botulinum alaska e <dig>  this procedure identified  <dig> cdss that did not have an equivalent amino acid sequence in alaska e <dig>  further analysis identified  <dig> amino acid sequences that were annotated for group ii c. botulinum strain eklund 17b  but where a similar function had not been assigned to any cds in the type e strains alaska e <dig> or beluga. these comprised several related to carbohydrate utilization including five chitinases, chitodextrinase, alpha amylase, beta-amylase, neopullulanase, maltose:maltodextrin transport system permease and starch binding protein. the tehb tellurite resistance protein was also identified. tests for tellurite resistance and carbohydrate utilisation were carried out to determine if the microarray findings correlated with physiological differences between type b or f strains and type e strains.

the minimum growth temperature and maximum nacl concentration allowing growth in the test conditions, and the results of the tellurite mic assay and the carbohydrate fermentation tests are shown in figure  <dig>  although there is variability between the strains, differences in the minimum growth temperature, maximum nacl concentration and tellurite resistance were relatively small compared to the range in bacteria as a whole. the range was  <dig> °c in growth temperature and  <dig> % in nacl concentration. the mean mic of tellurite was also similar for all strains, ranging from 10– <dig> mg ml- <dig>  bacteria are considered to be sensitive to tellurite if the mic is 1- <dig> mg l- <dig> and to be resistant at  <dig> mg l- <dig> <cit> . all the strains were of intermediate sensitivity. no relationship was observed between tellurite resistance and toxin type or clade with the mean mic of strains producing type b, e or f toxin being  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg l- <dig> respectively. similarly, there did not appear to be a clear relationship between toxin type and minimum growth temperature or maximum nacl concentration for growth. in the conditions used in this test, all strains grew at  <dig> °c and the lowest temperature at which growth was observed was  <dig> °c. the median minimum growth temperature was  <dig> °c for strains of each toxin type. on average the type e strains had a slightly higher tolerance to nacl than type b and type f strains, with a mean maximum nacl concentration of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, but there was considerable overlap between the strains of each toxin type.

different trends of carbohydrate utilisation were observed between strains in the three clades. all of the type e strains produced substantial quantities of acid from melezitose reducing the ph by more than  <dig> ph unit whereas no type f strains and only one type b strain, eklund 2b produced acid and that strain only reduced the ph by  <dig>  units. a similar but not identical response was observed for inositol fermentation with little or no acid production from type b or type f strains but large amounts of acid produced by all type e strains except dolman vh. none of the type e toxin producing strains produced acid from amylopectin, amylose or glycogen whilst all the f strains and the majority of b strains did . substantial acid was produced from xylitol by all type b strains in clade  <dig> and two type e strains cb-k-19e and cdc  <dig> 

discussion
previous studies have shown that group ii c. botulinum is a distinct species with strains forming a tight genetic group differing only in the type of neurotoxin formed: previous studies of 16s rrna have shown they have  <dig> - <dig> % sequence similarity  <cit> . the results of the present study show that, although group ii c. botulinum types b, e and f strains are closely related, the genomic content is quite variable and the strains can be grouped into distinct subsets: the type b and type f strains appear to be closely related to each other with only toxin cluster cdss being unique to either type while the type e strains formed a separate subset in the whole genome analysis. the dissimilarity is such that type b or f strains can be distinguished from type e strains on the basis of their whole genome alone, independently of their toxin cluster genes.

comparative genomic indexing of strains using microarray
the microarray used in this study was composed of probes for  <dig> cds in eklund 17b  with  <dig> of these being detected in all the strains tested. the 58% of cds that were missing or diverged in at least one test strain is greater than 37% reported for group i c. botulinum strains  <cit>  or 11-12% previously reported for a microarray analysis of nordic group i c. botulinum strains  <cit> . in the case of the nordic strains part of this disparity is likely to relate to the strains being isolates from a narrow geographical area. additionally some may be related to differences between the oligonucleotide based microarrays used in the present study and the pcr based microarrays used to study group i c. botulinum strains. however, the low number of cdss that could be detected as being shared by all strains tested illustrates there is considerable variability between strains of group ii c. botulinum at the nucleotide level. the present study supports the observation based on typing methods that genetic diversity between strains of group ii c. botulinum is greater than that between strains of group i c. botulinum <cit> 

the clustering patterns obtained using the microarray data are consistent with other typing methods previously used to classify group ii c. botulinum strains  <cit> . an aflp analysis by hill et al.  <cit>  also showed a very close relationship between eklund 17b and eklund 2b and separated group ii c. botulinum type b and type f strains from type e strains. similar patterns were also observed in a dendrogram based on hindiii ribotyping  <cit>  and aflp banding patterns  <cit> . a study using flagellin diversity to characterise c. botulinum strains, which included  <dig> type b,  <dig> type e and  <dig> type f group ii strains, clustered strains into ten flava types based on the dna sequence of a flagellin variable region  <cit> . they found that all the group ii type b and type f strains were flava group  <dig> while the e strains were of type  <dig> or  <dig>  the agreement with other genetic based methods suggests genomic indexing using microarrays could be an effective method of typing group ii c. botulinum. the consistency with which type b and f strains are clustered separately from type e strains by a number of different typing methods demonstrates there is a marked difference between these two subsets which goes beyond the type of toxin cluster they contain. one important benefit of this genomic microarray study over previous studies based on banding patterns is that it provides information on the genetic nature of this difference.

since the microarray was constructed using the sequence for c. botulinum eklund 17b , it will have a greater ability to resolve the more closely related type b and f strains than the more distantly related type e strains. for type e strains,  <dig> cdss were present in at least one strain and  <dig> cdss were present in all type e strains, indicating that there were  <dig> cdss to which the response of type e strains was variable. the clustering of type e strains from the microarray data agrees with that observed in previous studies. for example, type e strains beluga and cb-k-37e were closely related on the microarray dendrogram and clustered together in an analysis of type e strains by both mlst and aflp  <cit> . this suggests that despite being based on the eklund 17b genome, the microarray still contained a sufficient number of probes to variable cdss to effectively type c. botulinum type e strains.

the strains tested were isolated from a variety of foods and environmental sources from a number of different locations over a wide chronological period. no relationship was evident between their original environment, geographical location or date of isolation and the clustering pattern. this lack of relationship has previously been reported for type e strains by macdonald et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and is now shown also to be true for type b and type f strains. the clustering together of diverse strains isolated many years apart from distant locations suggests the genetic background of group ii c. botulinum is relatively stable.

the  <dig> cds detected in all strains using the microarray was substantially smaller than the conserved core geneset of  <dig> genes that were identified between eklund 17b , beluga and alaska e <dig> by reciprocal best match analysis of the genome sequences. much of this difference may be explained by the fact that the microarray study compared  <dig> strains representing types b, e and f whereas the reciprocal best match analysis compared only three genomes including a single type b strain and no type f strain. this indicates the need for further genomic sequence information from these group ii c. botulinum strains.

c. botulinum neurotoxin cluster genes and subtyping
microarray analysis showed all the strains tested had a single neurotoxin encoding gene with the type b gene associated with ha cluster, and type e toxin genes and type f toxin genes associated with orfx cluster. all the strains of group ii c. botulinum scored positive for a single toxin gene type whereas strains of group i c. botulinum have been shown to possess either one or two neurotoxin genes. the type b strains and the type f strains each had a single neurotoxin subtype.

it has been reported that the neurotoxin gene cluster has an evolutionary background distinct from a relatively stable genomic background for both group i and group ii c. botulinum organisms  <cit> . there seems to be the potential for horizontal transfer of toxin genes between species with type b toxin genes being found in group i c. botulinum and group ii c. botulinum; type e toxin genes in both group ii c. botulinum and c. butyricum; and type f toxin genes present in both groups i and ii c. botulinum and c. baratii. it has also been proposed that the similar gene arrangement of orfx <dig>  orfx <dig>  orfx <dig> and p <dig> in type a and type e toxin clusters suggests that gene transfer and recombination have occurred among type a and type e neurotoxin-producing clostridia  <cit> . it has also been observed that strains can lose the ability to produce toxin in laboratory culturing. it is then interesting to speculate why the present and previous studies appear to show a lack of transfer of toxin genes between group ii c. botulinum type e strains and the closely related group ii c. botulinum type b and type f strains, particularly when the toxin cluster is frequently on a mobile element and is seemingly easily lost. in this respect the toxin genes do not appear to be highly promiscuous and, to date, there is little evidence of horizontal gene transfer between group ii type b or type f and type e strains.

the potential for horizontal gene transfer in the genome of eklund 17b  was examined using the program alienhunter  <cit>  to identify particularly high scoring regions in addition to visualisation of whole genome comparisons. the number of putative horizontally transferred genes was very low with only one region that presented a score indicating the possibility of being laterally transferred. this short region of higher gc content encodes a dna helicase, a conserved hypothetical protein and a putative cell envelope protein comprising of two pfam duf <dig> domains of low score. this predicted protein shares some similarity with the c-terminal part of repetitive proteins from the aerobic sporeformer paenibacillus sp.

strains resembling group ii c. botulinum but that lack the neurotoxin gene have been isolated and, in the absence of specific nonemculture, are often called “type e like” strains  <cit> . the present study has revealed that some non-neurotoxigenic group ii c. botulinum strains are more like type b or f strains and than type e strains so it may be better to refer to all non-toxic strains as non-neurotoxigenic group ii c. botulinum.

clade specific cdss and physiology
the genomic indexing study showed that type b and f strains fall into a separate subset from type e strains. combining the microarray results with the genome sequence data of group ii c. botulinum eklund 17b  and alaska e <dig> allowed physiological differences between type b and f and type e strains to be predicted. however, the observed physiology did not necessarily match the predictions.

analysis of the annotated genome for eklund 17b  showed that all type b and type f strains tested carried tehb, a gene for tellurite resistance. however, this sequence was not present in any type e strain. it is a reasonable hypothesis that the presence of tehb would render type b and f strains more resistant to tellurite than type e strains. physiological tests showed all strains were of intermediate tellurite resistance and that there was no direct relationship between toxin type and tellurite resistance. therefore, the type e strains either have an alternative mechanism for tellurite resistance or they carry a version of tehb that is divergent from the eklund 17b  tehb orthologue. further analysis revealed two other genes that have been implicated in tellurite resistance, terd <cit>  and cysk <cit>  are present in eklund 17b  and thus were included in the genomic indexing study. all the group ii c. botulinum strains tested contained cysk, the gene product of which is cysteine synthase which catalyses the last step in cysteine biosynthesis. the terd gene was identified in all of the four clade  <dig> strains, one clade  <dig> type b strains and two clade  <dig> type e strains. the presence of these genes did not correlate with the observed tellurite resistance.

the data from the carbohydrate fermentation tests showed clear physiological differences between the type e toxin producing strains and the type b and type f toxin producing strains of group ii c. botulinum. these different patterns of carbohydrate fermentation could be helpful in identifying different subsets of group ii c. botulinum. although differences in carbohydrate fermentation were reflected in the clades generated by the genomic indexing study, it was not possible to predict which specific carbohydrates would be used by analysis of the microarray results. therefore, this study was unable to relate the genotype to the phenotype in terms of carbohydrate catabolism. the reason for the discrepancies may be partly due to shortcomings in the microarray data that shows only which cdss are missing or divergent from that of the reference strain, and does not indicate any alternative or additional cdss present in the test strain, and partly because the currently available annotation does not provide sufficient data for an accurate prediction of physiological behaviour. physiological findings apparently disparate to the genetic data have been recently described in escherichia coli o <dig> and may be as a result of a lack of general scientific data on a system and/or systems having the ability to compensate for the loss of genes by the use of others, or may result from a lack of transporters or ability of a specific substance to be taken up by individual strains  <cit> .

each of the type b and type f strains carried five cdss annotated as chitinases whilst no such cdss were identified by either microarray or blast in the type e strains. however, none of the type b, e or f strains fermented chitosan and eklund 17b  failed to degrade chitin in an agar plate based activity assay . further analysis is required to establish whether the sequences designated as chitinases are involved in degradation of chitin or other polysaccharides. since chitin is composed of repeating units of n-acetylglucosamine , and nag is present in the bacterial cell wall, the functions of these enzymes may involve degradation of bacterial cell wall components rather than of chitin itself. similarly, analysis of the pathways in the kegg database for the two fully sequenced strains of group ii c. botulinum, eklund 17b  and alaska e <dig>  did not necessarily correspond to the observed physiological data. for example, there was not an obvious explanation for the difference in inositol or xylitol utilisation between the type b strain eklund 17b  and the type e strain alaska e <dig> as the enzymes required in the pathway for their utilisation were not found in either. however, c. botulinum eklund 17b  did contain an open reading frame annotated as glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, an enzyme used in the conversion of starch and glycogen to cdp-glucose, which is used in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. the genome of alaska e <dig> did not contain a cds annotated as being for for this enzyme and the type e strains were unable to ferment amylose, amylopectin or glycogen.

failure to find any relationship between annotation and the physiological differences observed between the different cluster types highlights that, as a predictor of the underlying physiology and metabolism, automated annotation shows clear discrepancies. these point to the need for better curation of annotations in the future, in the light of experimental data. current annotations are subject to transitive catastrophe, where a mistaken annotation can easily become propagated through many future annotations. taken together with lack of scientific knowledge on particular systems, of regulatory and transport processes, it is clear that in some cases the currently available annotation in conjunction with kegg mapping data shows particular discrepancies with respect to the metabolic pathways predicted in the organism and the actual metabolism seen in culture.

the observation that there are genetic and physiological differences between type b and f strains and type e strains could be important to the risk of food poisoning. the ability of type b and f strains but not type e strains to ferment amylose, amylopectin or glycogen is important for microbiological food safety as starch is a major component of many foods. similarly, information on strain variability in minimum growth temperature and the maximum nacl concentration or water activity allowing growth is important for improved quantitative risk assessment. the average temperature of chilled food at retail in the uk is  <dig> – 6°c and the average temperature in domestic refrigerators is  <dig> °c  <cit> . information on the number, or type, of strains able to grow at these temperatures is necessary to be able to predict the potential for growth in chilled foods and thereby control product safety. previous workers have reported better growth at low temperatures of type f strains than other group ii strains  <cit>  although a recent study reported that type f strains of group ii c. botulinum have a higher minimum growth temperature than type b or type e strains  <cit> . the present study did not identify an association of toxin type with stronger growth at chill temperature. considering the increasing sales of chilled food  <cit>  and the importance of chill temperature for food safety, further analysis seems justified.

CONCLUSIONS
a genomic microarray was created and used to characterise strains of group ii c. botulinum. this method was shown to be capable of typing strains of group ii c. botulinum. the results obtained from the genomic indexing were compared with physiological tests for minimum growth temperature, maximum nacl concentration for growth, carbohydrate utilisation and sensitivity to tellurite. although group ii c. botulinum strains form a tight genetic group, genomic and physiological analysis indicates the strains fall into two subsets: all type b strains and type f strains are in one subset and all type e strains in the other. no evidence of recent transfer of toxin genes between these two groups was found.

no strong relationship between toxin type and minimum growth temperature or maximum nacl concentration for growth was observed. however, data from the carbohydrate fermentation tests showed different patterns of carbohydrate fermentation between the type e toxin producing strains and the type b and f toxin producing strains of group ii c. botulinum which could be helpful in identifying these different types. coding sequences that were present in all type b and f strains but not in type e strains were identified but the current level of annotation for this organism  meant it was not possible to translate any of these differences directly into observed physiological characteristics. the differences observed between the type e strains and the type b and f strains indicate that there is more genetic and physiological variability in group ii c. botulinum strains than was previously thought.
