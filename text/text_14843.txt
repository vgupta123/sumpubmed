BACKGROUND
dicyemid mesozoans  are typically found in the kidneys of cephalopod mollusks . they have neither body cavities nor differentiated organs, such as nervous and gastrointestinal systems . their life cycle consists of two phases . one is the vermiform stage, in which the dicyemid exists as a vermiform embryo formed asexually from an agamete to form worms in the renal sac of the host. the other is the infusoriform larva, which develops from a fertilized egg produced around hermaphroditic gonads called infusorigens and can escape from the host into seawater. how the infusoriform larvae enter the vermiform stage in the new host is unknown. however, high population density in the cephalopod phase may cause the shift from an asexual mode to a sexual mode of reproduction. notably, both fertilization and embryonic development occur within the worm body. the viviparous mode of reproduction makes this organism a good subject for developmental analysis  <cit> .

the original classification of dicyemids as mesozoa reflects their intermediate position between the protozoa  and metazoa  in body organization. the phylogeny of the dicyemids is controversial, and some researchers consider that dicyemids represent truly primitive multicellular organisms. however, several zoologists regard the simple body plan of dicyemids as the result of specialization of parasitism . recent molecular studies suggest that dicyemids are not truly primitive animals. 18s rdna phylogenetic analyses by katayama et al.  <cit>  showed that the dicyemids belong among the bilateria, and from the structure of the amino acid  sequence in the carboxy-terminal flanking region of the antennapedia protein in dicyema orientale, kobayashi et al.  <cit>  suggested their affinity to the lophotrochozoa. a limited number of genes are available for phylogenetic analysis, and the phylogenetic relationships of the dicyemids will need further evaluation when the sequences of more genes become available.

if reduction of body plan complexity secondary to parasitism truly happened in dicyemids, we expect to find genomic features in the dicyemid genome that are associated with the adaptive simplification of body organization. however, such features have not been described in dicyemids. in broader terms, the genomic basis of the simplification that occurs during the course of evolution is poorly understood.

to determine the genomic changes that may occur during the simplification of body organization, we focused on pax <dig> and zic  in dicyemids. pax <dig> plays key roles in the development of sensory organs and the nervous system . in particular, pax <dig> is a master gene in eye development in both vertebrates and drosophila. in contrast, zic family proteins have diverse roles . in vertebrates, they are crucial for embryonic patterning as well as neural tube formation, neural crest generation, and mesodermal segmentation. in urochordates, zic proteins are required for cell fate decisions for differentiation into various cell lineages, including nerve, muscle, and notochord tissues. in protostomes, zic genes are essential for embryonic segmentation, midgut morphogenesis, adult head formation in drosophila  <cit> , and vulva formation in caenorhabditis  <cit> . both pax <dig> and zic have structurally related genes in cnidarians; the possible involvement of these cnidarian genes in developmental processes analogous to those controlled by their triploblast homologs has been proposed  <cit> .

here, we investigated the structures of the dicyemid pax <dig> and zic genes and  <dig> housekeeping genes , together with the pax <dig> and zic expression patterns. our results should add to knowledge of the phylogenetic position, common genomic features of the dicyemids, and the role of pax <dig> and zic in their ontogeny.

RESULTS
amino acid sequences of dicyema pax <dig> and zic proteins
we cloned dicyema orthologs of the pax <dig>  zic, and actin genes by pcr amplification of dicyema acuticephalum cdna and genomic dna. both genomic and cdna fragments containing entire open reading frames were cloned and sequenced to reveal the entire aa sequences encoded and the exon-intron boundaries . two types of zic and actin genes were identified; they were termed zica/zicb and actin1/actin <dig>  respectively. in the course of the cloning procedure, we fortunately obtained sequences representing  <dig> more genes, the housekeeping genes atps and aldolase, both of which were fully cloned to supplement the analysis .

we first examined the conserved domains of the putative aa sequence of dicyema pax <dig> , which contained two conserved domains, the paired box domain  and homeodomain , as do pax <dig> proteins from other animals. both domains act as dna-binding domains. alignment of the putative aa sequences of the dicyema pax <dig> pd  and hd  with those of known metazoan pax sequences revealed marked similarity among these domains. dna-interacting aa residues have been determined in human pax <dig> pd by a crystal structure analysis  <cit> . conservation between the human and dicyema sequences was more strongly observed in the dna-contacting aa residues  than in non-contacting residues  , suggesting the functional importance of the former type of residues. aa sequences other than those of pd and hd showed no clear similarity to those encoded by other pax <dig> orthologs .

dicyema zica  and zicb  showed strong similarity to each other . a homology search analysis with zic family proteins in other species revealed that the region of greatest similarity was confined to a zinc finger  domain comprising tandem repetitions of  <dig> c2h <dig> zf motifs  ; other regions, including the zic-opa-conserved  and zf-n-terminal flanking-conserved  domains, lacked noteworthy similarity with other zic family members  <cit> . in the multiple alignment of zf and zfnc from various species , dicyema zica and zicb showed clear similarity to other zic proteins in the zf2– <dig> region, which is strongly conserved among all zic proteins identified so far. the number of aa residues between the two cysteines of the zf <dig> c2h <dig> motif was  <dig>  this structure is analogous to those of other zic proteins that have highly variable numbers in this region  and is different from those of gli/glis proteins , which share similar zf domain sequences with zic family proteins.

we identified two dicyema actin genes that encode actin <dig>  and actin <dig>  proteins . the difference in sequence length reflects the presence or absence of an n terminal region, and the homology in the overlapping region was 89% at the aa level.

exon-intron organization of the dicyema genes
in total, there were  <dig> spliceosomal introns in the protein coding regions of the  <dig> genes . the size of the introns was a surprising feature, as they were generally short and distributed over a narrow range . this intron length may be representative of the major population of intron sizes in dicyemids.

the positions of introns in the conserved domains of zica, zicb, and pax <dig> were identical to those previously identified as evolutionarily conserved intron positions in each gene family  <cit> . the dicyema zica and zicb genes both possessed a single intron in the center of the evolutionarily conserved zf domain . the positions of these introns corresponded to that of the a-intron, which was conserved in all  <dig> zic genes from  <dig> different bilaterian phyla but was not found in the  <dig> cnidarian zic genes evaluated  <cit> . dicyema pax <dig> had  <dig> introns  in the putative protein-coding region . of the  <dig> introns, one  was located in pd and  <dig>  were in hd. the positions of these  <dig> introns matched those of the introns of evolutionarily conserved pax genes from a broad range of eumetazoans  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis utilizing the dicyema aa sequences
we next tested whether the dicyema sequences obtained are useful to understand the phylogenetic position of dicyema. all of the deduced aa sequences were subjected to molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the neighbour-joining , bayesian inference , and maximum parsimony  methods. a support for the bilaterian origin was obtained in the case of the pax <dig> molecular phylogeny.

the metazoan pax family sequences can be classified into five groups  <cit> . for the molecular phylogenetic analysis of dicyema pax <dig>  we first used 129– <dig> aa pd sequences. dicyema pax <dig> sequences, previously known pax <dig> sequences, and representative pax sequences from the other groups. the phylogenetic trees by bi  and nj  methods, commonly grouped dicyema pax <dig> with other pax <dig> sequences. we also performed the analysis using the concatenated pd and hd sequences  from pax <dig> family and its closest relatives, cnidarian and placozoan paxb sequences . dicyema pax <dig> was grouped with pax <dig> family commonly in the bi , nj , and mp  trees. deciphering more detailed phylogenetic position within the bilaterian was not possible in the current analysis.

to confirm the robustness of the trees, we replaced the dicyema branch to other places in the bi tree, and performed the likelihood ratio test developed by shimodaira and hasegawa  <cit> . the results indicated that the placement of the dicyema branch to other bilaterian clades did not significantly worsen the tree except placing in urochodate clade whereas its relocation to non-pax <dig> clades worsen the likelihood scores .

in comparison to the pax <dig>  molecular phylogenetic analysis of zic and the three house keeping proteins did not provide us any insights concerning the phylogenetic position of dicyema  . in the case of zic nj tree , dicyema was grouped with diverged type zic protein  <cit> . however, the phylogenetic relationship of diverged type of zic proteins are highly mixed up with low statistical support.

accelerated evolutionary rate in dicyema species
while conducting the molecular phylogenetic analysis, we noticed that the dicyema genes were always placed with long branches in the phylogenetic trees. to test whether the evolutionary rate in dicyema was higher than those of the other groups of animals, we compared the number of substituted aa residues with the number of bilaterian ancestor aa sequences predicted by the ancescon program  <cit> . for this purpose, the available sequences from major bilaterian phyla were collected from the ncbi databases, excluding paralogs to uniformly represent phylogenetic variances. the comparative analysis included the  <dig> sequences encoded by the  <dig> gene groups . among the bilaterian orthologs, the aa sequence of the  <dig> housekeeping genes  from dicyema generally showed the highest degree of sequence divergence from the putative bilaterian ancestor sequences . the differences in the aa substitution frequencies between the dicyema and the other bilaterian sequences were statistically significant . the divergence rates of the dicyema actin sequences were particularly high , compared with those of atps and aldolase .

the dicyema pax <dig>  zica, and zicb aa sequences had divergence rates  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than the means of these sequences in the other bilaterians, supporting the hypothesis that the sequence divergence rate is increased among the proteins encoded by dicyema genes. however, in the case of zic and pax <dig>  the divergence rates varied among the bilaterian phyla. the variance in divergence rates over all of the common animal taxa differed strongly between zic and the  <dig> housekeeping proteins .

expression patterns of zica, zicb, pax <dig>  and actin
one of our main interests was the role of pax <dig> and zic in these highly simplified animals. to obtain clues, we examined the spatial expression profiles of these genes in dicyema bodies. dicyemid zica and zicb were expressed in the hermaphroditic gonads  within the axial cells . no expression was detected in the embryonic stages . pax <dig> was detected weakly throughout the developmental stages of the  <dig> types of embryo and in the hermaphroditic gonads, frequently only in the sperm . thus, the hermaphroditic gonads expressed pax <dig>  zica, and zicb most clearly .

in contrast to the highly restricted expression of zic genes, actin <dig> was expressed widely: in the agamete, hermaphroditic gonad, and the  <dig> types of developing embryo . actin <dig> showed an expression pattern very similar to that of actin <dig> . in the hermaphroditic gonads , actin <dig> expression was detected in the sperm and the early-stage primary oocytes. in the developing infusoriform embryos, actin <dig> transcript was detected in blastomeres in the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo from the early to middle stages of development . in the late developmental stages, expression was restricted to the urn cells that consisted of the internal mass of the embryo . in the vermiform embryos, actin <dig> was expressed in the presumptive peripheral cells and agametes within the axial cell of the embryo .

discussion
phylogenetic position of dicyemids
recent phylogenetic analysis of pax genes revealed five main classes of pax genes   <cit> . in a comprehensive analysis  <cit> , pax <dig> and pax <dig> homologues are limited to bilaterians and mammalians, respectively, even though a cnidarian genome project is completing  <cit> . based on these backgrounds, we think that the grouping of the dicyema pax homologue with bilaterian pax <dig> genes in this study supports the bilaterian origin of dicyema.

in addition to the pax <dig> phylogeny, the presence of introns at bilaterian-specific positions in the zica and zicb zf-encoding domains also favors the idea that dicyemids have bilaterian ancestry. taken together with the results of previous molecular phylogenetic studies , we can conclude that dicyemids are members of the bilateria, and that dicyemids are simplified bilaterian animals. in fact, the infusoriform larvae of dicyemids have a bilateral body plan . this feature seems to represent the true level of organization in dicyemids, because these larvae are free-swimming, whereas the adult stages are restricted to the renal organs of host cephalopods  <cit> . the bodies of the adult stages might have been simplified as a reflection of their specialization to their parasitic habitat – the tubular spaces of cephalopod renal organs  <cit> .

although we tried to delineate in more detail the origin of dicyema by using other dicyema sequences, including concatenated ones, the attempt was unsuccessful . the difficulty seems to lie mainly in the highly diverged nature of the dicyema sequences. molecular phylogenetic analyses using other sets of slowly evolving sequences may improve our understanding.

accelerated molecular evolution of dicyemids
the five dicyema sequences obtained in this study generally showed higher aa sequence diversification rates than the mean rates of other bilaterian orthologs. in a recent study, thomas et al.  <cit>  revealed that marked rate variations exist among the echinodermata, arthropoda, mollusca, annelida, and platyhelminthes. they suggested that the existence of a strict molecular clock cannot be assumed for the metazoa. the fact that we found general acceleration of the divergence rate in dicyema may support this idea.

there are two circumstances under which lineage-specific differences in divergence rates may arise  <cit> :  alteration in the mutation rate of the species ; and  differences in the proportion of mutations that become fixed in a population . in the case of dicyemids, both remain plausible, because only self-fertilization occurs in dicyemids  <cit> . however, we can at least speculate that the presence of an asexual reproductive cycle may accelerate the accumulation of mutations, because a recent study showed that transition to asexuality leads to an excess number of aa substitutions in a microcrustacean, daphnia pulex  <cit> . other possibilities, including shorter generation time and higher metabolic rate, remain open.

short and similarly-sized introns in dicyemids
another critical finding about the dicyema genome was the consistently short length of the introns in dicyemid genes, especially compared with other eumetazoans. size distribution analyses have revealed that the mean lengths of human, ciona, and drosophila introns peak at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp, respectively  <cit> . dicyema introns were even smaller than the average introns of fungi   <cit> . a recent study showed that the ciliated protozoan paramecium tetraurelia has 20- to 35-bp introns   <cit> . this is very close to our mean intron size for dicyema . although the intron size varies in the eukaryotes, dicyema may belong to the lowest group.

there is currently no definitive answer to the biological significance of the smallness and uniformity of these intron sizes. however, we noticed that more extreme cases of intron size reduction appear in the nucleomorph of the alga bigelowella natans  <cit> . the nucleomorph is a vestige of the eukaryotic cell nucleus after an endosymbiotic process in which one eukaryotic cell is engulfed by another. the sizes of the  <dig> introns in the bigelowella natans nucleomorph genome are limited to either  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> bp. considering the analogous situation between endosymbiosis and parasitism, the shortening of the introns in dicyemids may reflect a high level of selective pressure to reduce unnecessary expense  during the course of adaptive simplification. the size reduction may be facilitated by a lack of the need for the presumptive cis-regulatory elements essential for adapting to various environments.

gene-to-gene variation of the divergence profile across metazoan phyla
the actin sequences showed particularly strong diversification between dicyema and other eumetazoa. this finding surprised us, because actin genes are widely conserved in eukaryotes, including in fungi and plants, in which pax <dig> or zic homologs have not yet been identified. dicyema actin was expressed in the agamete, hermaphroditic gonad, and the developmental stages of the  <dig> types of embryo. actin bundles play a role in many cellular processes, such as cell division. this suggests that more transcripts of actin may be required for cell division and cleavage during embryogenesis than in the external structure of the worms . the actin bundles also contribute to cell movement; actin expression was therefore detected in unflagellated sperm in the dicyemids. considering the essential role of actin in determining cell shape in multicellular animals, it is tempting to speculate that a reduction in somatic cell number, as is seen in dicyema, may reduce the evolutionary constraint on actin protein structure.

pax <dig> and zic genes in the highly simplified metazoa
our major interest was in the features of dicyema pax <dig> and zic, which are utilized in the developmental processes of many bilaterians. in this context, they can be regarded as "toolkit genes  <cit> ," like the genes encoding hox, parahox, and other developmentally critical transcription factors. our most important finding may be the presence of both genes in the dicyemid. these genes could have been lost in the course of evolution. in particular, pax <dig> is widely involved in photosensing organ development in bilaterians  <cit> . however, pax <dig> pd/hd and zic zf were fairly well conserved, and their diversification rates were comparable to those of atps and aldolase and lower than that of actin.

based on their expression profiles, the products of zica and zicb may have a similar role in the hermaphroditic gonad within the axial cell. dicyema zic genes may therefore be associated with gametogenesis or the differentiation of gametes.

dicyema pax <dig> was detected throughout the developmental stages of the  <dig> types of embryo and in the hermaphroditic gonads. the location of this expression suggests that dicyema pax <dig> has few specific roles, such as the genetic control of eye development and neurogenesis. in this regard, previous studies showed various roles pax <dig> in eumetazoan development. in caenorhabditis elegans, its pax <dig> homologue  is required for the cell fate decision of a male specific blast cell lineage  <cit> , and the control of hermaphrodite gonad size and shape  <cit> . in planarians, pax6a is expressed not only in their nervous system but also in a non-cephalic parenchyma that gives rise to ventral marginal adhesive zone and is dispensable for eye regeneration  <cit> . together with our results, the phylogenetic role of pax <dig> may not be limited to the nervous system and photosensing organs.

the maintenance of the two toolkit genes in dicyema that lack photosensing organs or nervous systems suggests that these genes possess unexpected versatility in the development of multicellular animals. the common expression of pax <dig> and zic in dicyema hermaphroditic gonads suggests that they can be involved even in the most fundamental and indispensable function in multicellular animals, i.e. gametogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the results in this study can be summarized as follows: 1) the pax <dig> molecular phylogeny and zic intron positions supported the idea of dicyemids as reduced bilaterians; 2) the aa sequences deduced from the  <dig> dicyema genes were highly divergent in comparison to those from bilaterians; 3) dicyemid genes contained very short introns of uniform length; and 4) zica and zicb were expressed in hermaphroditic gonads, and pax <dig> was expressed weakly throughout the developmental stages of the  <dig> types of embryo and in the hermaphroditic gonads. the accelerated evolutionary rates and very short and uniform intron may represent a part of dicyema genomic features. the presence and expression of the  <dig> tool-kit genes  in dicyema suggests that they can be very versatile genes even required for the nervous-system-or-photosensing-organ-lacking bilaterian.
