BACKGROUND
the persimmon diospyros kaki thunb.  originated in china and was principally cultivated in china, korea and japan  <cit> . persimmon cultivars are classified into four types, including pollination-constant nonastringent , pollination-constant astringent , pollination-variant nonastringent , and pollination-variant astringent ; this classification is based on the effect of pollination on flesh colour and the natural loss of astringency at the harvest time on the tree  <cit> . the pcna type includes japanese pcna  and chinese pcna , which differ in their genetic characteristic of pcna trait  <cit> . the natural loss of astringency is a trait that is qualitatively inherited and recessive in jpcna cultivars  <cit>  but dominant in cpcna cultivars. when the cpcna cultivar ‘luotian-tianshi’ is crossed as the maternal parent to a jpcna or non-pcna type, the f <dig> offspring are segregated into a 1: <dig> ratio for pcna:non-pcna types  <cit> . cpcna cultivars have attracted attention in the breeding industry because of their natural ability to lose astringency, which is a dominant trait. in addition, cpcna has the potential to be an important parent in pcna persimmon breeding in the future.

persimmon resources are widely distributed in china. however, almost all traditional cultivars native to china are of the pca type; some of these cultivars include ‘mopanshi’, ‘fuping-jianshi’, and ‘gongcheng-shuishi’  <cit> . ‘luotian-tianshi’  is the first pcna persimmon native to china, and it is only distributed in dabieshan mountain around the junction of hubei, henan, and anhui provinces in central china  <cit> .

most persimmon fruits accumulate proanthocyanidins  in their flesh during development, causing the sensation of astringency due to the coagulation of oral proteins  <cit> . pas or condensed tannins are synthesised via the shikimate and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . to date, many genes encoding the structural proteins and transcription factors involved in pa biosynthesis, transportation, and polymerisation have been isolated by homology-based cloning  <cit> . however, the primary genes involved in pa biosynthesis have not yet been determined.

high-throughput sequencing technologies developed in recent years provide a convenient way of establishing a rapid and efficient molecular research platform. next-generation sequencing  is related to the sanger sequencing method, which is represented by first-generation sequencing technologies. currently, the three mainstream ngs technologies are roche/ <dig> pyrosequencing , illumina/solexa sequencing , and abi/solid sequencing . these ngs technologies vary in their input requirements and sequence output with regard to the total bases sequenced, length of each sequence read, and price per megabase of sequence information  <cit> . among these technologies,  <dig> sequencing, which generates a minimum number of sequence reads, produces the longest reads . long reads are optimal for initial genome and transcriptome characterisation because longer pieces are assembled more efficiently than shorter pieces  <cit> . given their rapid processing, high throughput, and cost effectiveness, ngs technologies have been successfully used to study genomes and transcriptomes of species with and without sequenced genomes. many novel and functional genes can be obtained from massive amounts of data.

abundant genetic resources for persimmons are currently available. however, genomic information and est sequences for this fruit tree are lacking. in addition, molecular data on persimmons are insufficient when compared to those of other fruit trees, such as apple, pear, peach, citrus, and grape. accordingly, we performed large-scale transcriptome sequencing of cpcna persimmon fruit using roche/ <dig> technology to create a transcript sequence database of the persimmon and identify candidate genes involved in pa biosynthesis and tannin coagulation. we used ideg <dig> to filter the differentially expressed genes in the treatment  and control  libraries. we also verified the differentially expressed unigenes by quantitative real time pcr . the present study provides a platform for studying the genes involved in persimmon tannin coagulation and tannin biosynthesis to analyse the relationship between differentially expressed genes and persimmon fruit deastringency and clarify the mechanism of astringency loss for cpcna.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
the soluble pa concentration of the cpcna persimmon fruit was < <dig> % in the group treated with 5% ethanol after  <dig> d but was still very high  in the control group , suggesting that astringency was successfully removed in the treated fruit. in the printing test, the colour change observed after the reaction between fecl <dig> and soluble tannin was dark in the control group but light in the treatment group, suggesting that the amount of soluble tannin decreased in the treated fruit . a half-plate run using the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform was carried out on the cdna that was generated by smart technology with the total rna from the tr  and co libraries. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  high-quality reads were generated from the tr and co libraries, with average sequence lengths of  <dig> and 309 bp, respectively . after trimming the adaptor sequences and removing those shorter than 100 bp, the clean reads of the two libraries were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences using mimicking intelligent read assembly , with an average size of 579 bp. a summary of the  <dig> sequencing and assembly is presented in table  <dig>  and the size distributions for these reads and unigenes are presented in figure  <dig> 

sequence annotation
estimating the number of genes and the level of transcript coverage is difficult because of the lack of genetic or genomic information on persimmons. we performed blastx alignments  against the databases of ncbi-nonredundant , swissprot, gene ontology , and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  to identify the putative functions of the unigene sequences. a total of  <dig>  unigenes, accounting for  <dig> % of the total unigenes, were annotated to nr database .

we used go to obtain a functional annotation of the persimmon unigenes  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were assigned to at least one go term . of the unigenes assigned to go terms,  <dig>  were assigned to cellular location,  <dig>  to molecular function, and  <dig>  to biological processes . these unigenes were further classified into  <dig> functional subcategories. within each of the three main categories of the go classification scheme , the dominant subcategories were ‘cell’ , ‘cell part’ , ‘binding’ , ‘catalytic activity’ , ‘cellular process’ , and ‘metabolic process’ .

the protein database clusters of orthologous group  has been designed to classify proteins from completely sequenced genomes based on orthology  <cit> . we searched annotated sequences for genes involved in cog classification to predict and classify the possible functions of all oriental persimmon unigenes. of the  <dig>  sequences that returned a hit with the nr database,  <dig>  could be assigned to  <dig> cog categories . among these categories, the cluster for ‘general function prediction only’ was the largest group , followed by ‘post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’  and ‘translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis’ . the clusters for ‘nuclear structure’ , ‘cell motility’ , and ‘cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning’  were the smallest groups.

we mapped the annotated sequences to the reference canonical pathways contained in the kegg database to identify the biological pathways in persimmons. this approach is an alternative way of categorising gene functions by emphasising biochemical pathways  <cit> . according to the kegg results,  <dig>  unigenes were mapped to  <dig> predicted metabolic pathways . the transcripts identified as related to the following components or processes were the most abundant: translation ; folding, sorting, and degradation ; carbohydrate metabolism ; amino acid metabolism ; energy metabolism ; and transcription . the largest category was metabolism , which included carbohydrate metabolism , amino acid metabolism , energy metabolism , enzyme families , lipid metabolism , glycan biosynthesis and metabolism , metabolism of other amino acids , nucleotide metabolism , and other subcategories . in the secondary metabolism category,  <dig> subcategories comprised  <dig> unigenes, the most represented of which were phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ; flavonoid biosynthesis ; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosyntheses ; streptomycin biosynthesis ; caffeine metabolism ; and tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosyntheses  . in addition to the metabolic pathways, the genetic information processing pathways  and cellular processes pathways  were also highly represented categories.

detection of differentially expressed unigenes in the tr and co libraries
a previous study proposed that comparing the number of reads for a gene between different libraries or different genes in the same library could be a reliable indicator of relative gene expression  <cit> . thus, ideg <dig> was used to identify unigenes that show a statistically significant difference in terms of relative abundance  between the two libraries. a total of  <dig> unigenes that were differentially expressed in the tr and co libraries were identified. of these  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in the treated fruit. more genes were expressed in the treated fruit  than the control fruit  .

quantitative real-time pcr confirmation
fifty differentially expressed unigenes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis  to confirm the expression of the unigenes from the sequencing and computational analyses. cdna fragments of the control and flesh treated for  <dig> d  were used as templates. the results showed that the qrt-pcr assessments  of  <dig> unigenes  were consistent with those of the  <dig> sequencing analysis . these results suggest that our transcriptome data have a high coverage.

discussion
currently, the most common application of ngs in nonmodel species is transcriptome characterisation  <cit> . among the currently available ngs technologies,  <dig> pyrosequencing produces the longest reads; thus, it has emerged as a powerful tool for transcriptome sequencing. in addition, many studies have used de novo assembly of such data to produce genome-level resources for non-model organisms  <cit> .

genetic studies of the persimmon are difficult to implement because of the hexaploid nature of the species and lack of linkage maps and whole genome sequences . previous genetic studies have focused on the diversity and phylogeny of cultivated persimmons and related wild species. the transcriptome characterisation described in the present study will provide the initial information needed for the functional study of persimmons. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads were generated from the tr and co libraries, with average sequence lengths of  <dig> and 309 bp, respectively. we obtained  <dig>  unigenes from these raw reads . the average unigene length for persimmons in this study was comparable to that observed in other species such as oncidium   <cit> , pinus contorta   <cit> , fraxinus   <cit> , and vicia faba   <cit> . further, the unigene was longer than that observed in ziziphus celata   <cit>  and olea europaea   <cit>  but shorter than that in castanea mollissima   <cit>  and pyrus pyrifolia   <cit> . the length of unigenes may be related to the sequencing technique and assembly tools used. however, the unigenes assembled in the present study could provide resources for future persimmon genetic and genomic research.

blast searches against public databases, such as nr, swissprot, go, and kegg, provided annotation data for the persimmon, with  <dig>   unique hits . the annotation of persimmon gained more descriptive information than that observed in other species such as conyza canadensis   <cit> , bupleurum chinense   <cit> , dendrocalamus latiflorus   <cit> , lens culinaris   <cit> , and panax quinquefolius   <cit> . however, it was lower than that observed in fagopyrum   <cit> , taxus cuspidata   <cit> , capsicum annuum   <cit> , olea europaea   <cit> , pyrus pyrifolia   <cit> , dendrocalamus latiflorus   <cit> , eichhornia paniculata   <cit> , and fraxinus   <cit> . however, comparing this information across species studies is difficult because of the different sequencing depths or blast parameters utilized in each report  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  persimmon unigenes were mapped into  <dig> kegg pathways . the genetic information processing pathway  and cellular processes pathway  were highly represented categories in the metabolic pathways. most persimmon fruits accumulate pas in their flesh during development; pas cause astringency due to coagulation of oral proteins and are synthesised from metabolites via the shikimate and flavonoid pathways  <cit> . therefore, we focused on the pathways pertaining to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  and flavonoid biosynthesis . most of the genes related to pa biosynthesis in these two pathways were found in our transcriptome sequencing data. pas cause astringency that is often undesirable for human consumption; thus, the removal of astringency is an important practice in the persimmon food industry. soluble pas can be converted to insoluble pas by enclosing the fruit in a polyethylene bag containing diluted ethanol  <cit> . acetaldehyde formed in situ from ethanol is involved in the direct insolubilisation of soluble pas, causing a loss of astringency  <cit> . pyruvate decarboxylase  and alcohol dehydrogenase  are two important enzymes in this process, which is involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway . moreover, six and  <dig> unigenes were classified into the pdc and adh families, respectively.

the expression levels of the unigenes were reflected by the number of reads used to characterise the differences in gene expression between the tr and co transcriptome libraries. a total of  <dig> unigenes were found to be differently expressed . the expression levels of the unigenes involved in pa biosynthesis and tannin coagulation are shown in table  <dig>  the expression levels of adh <dig>  4cl, ans, and f3′5′h were significantly downregulated, whereas those of adh <dig>  pdc, chs, f3h, and lar were significantly upregulated after the removal of astringency. these results suggest that the expression of genes involved in pa biosynthesis might be affected by ethanol treatment, which is consistent with the findings of ikegami et al.  <cit> . acetaldehyde produced from ethanol is involved in the direct insolubilisation of soluble pas  <cit> . the synthesis of acetaldehyde is generally catalysed by pdc, which converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde; meanwhile, adh is involved in the potentially reversible interconversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde  <cit> . furthermore, adh <dig> and pdc are suggested as the key genes involved in persimmon astringency removal  <cit> . in the present study, the pdc gene was upregulated, which resulted in the production of more acetaldehyde. however, the adh <dig> gene was downregulated, which may result in the reduction of the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol. this result suggests that acetaldehyde accumulated in the ethanol-treated fruit, which resulted in the loss of astringency. however, this result was not consistent with that reported in min’s study  <cit> , where adh <dig> was upregulated by ethylene. this inconsistency in the results can be attributed to the different cultivars used . the use of different materials might cause different gene expression patterns; however, this hypothesis needs to be validated by further experimentation.

we found that the gene aldehyde dehydrogenase family  <dig>  was highly expressed  in the co library and downregulated in the tr library , with a total of  <dig> unigenes in both libraries . aldh <dig> has a broad expression pattern and is most notably involved in the second step of ethanol metabolism, . the decrease in aldh <dig> in the tr library might have inhibited the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid, which, consequently, led to acetaldehyde accumulation. large amounts of acetaldehyde triggered the coagulation of tannins  causing the loss of astringency in the treated persimmon fruits. this result suggests that the aldh <dig> gene, together with the adh and pdc genes, might have important functions in tannin coagulation.

the present study on persimmon transcriptome has several biological implications. first, the plant material persimmon, which accumulates pas  in its flesh during development, can be considered a model plant for tannin research. second, the loss of astringency in cpcna fruits treated with ethanol is an imitation of the natural loss of astringency, especially for tannin coagulation. this imitation helped us to understand mechanism of astringency loss in cpcna. third, the current study, based on the present transcriptome data , will facilitate the advancement future genetic studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this work presents the first de novo transcriptome sequencing analysis of the cpcna persimmon fruit using the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. a total of  <dig>  mb of data were generated and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. persimmon unigenes related to pa biosynthesis were characterised, and differentially expressed unigenes in the two libraries were verified using qrt-pcr. adh, pdc, and the newly discovered persimmon gene aldh <dig> were found to have important functions in tannin coagulation. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to employ the  <dig> sequencing technology to investigate the whole transcriptome of the persimmon fruit. the assembly of the reads was also conducted without a reference genome. the transcriptome characterisation described in the present study will provide the initial information needed for the functional study of persimmons to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tannin coagulation and other biochemical processes in this fruit tree.
