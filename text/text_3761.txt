BACKGROUND
brassica, which comprises six species, three diploid  and three tetraploid , is important in global agriculture and food production. each of the three diploid species contains one of the original genomes, a, b or c; spontaneous hybridization between two of these three original genomes produced the three tetraploid species  <cit> . according to recent comparative genomic studies  <cit>  the three original genomes arose from the same ancestry, so all six species have complex genomes, especially the three tetraploid plants. in general, three paralogous regions were predicted for the diploids and six for the tetraploids. these brassica species produce an oil that contains essential human dietary components, and some components of the oil are used in industry  <cit> . during the past  <dig> years, major traits of brassica have been significantly improved: yield, plant architecture, seed quality and so on. the erucic acid content of the seeds is also a major trait to be considered in improving brassica oilseed. a low erucic acid content is necessary for human health, while a high content is necessary for industrial use  <cit> . therefore, there is a pressing need to collect and identify different kinds of genetic resources, including high and low seed erucic acid contents, for breeding new brassica cultivars.

fae <dig>  is the key gene in controlling erucic acid synthesis in brassica seeds. it was originally cloned in arabidopsis by directed transposon tagging with the maize element activator ; no intron was found in this gene  <cit> . the product of fae <dig> is a condensing enzyme that extends fatty acid chain lengths from c <dig> to c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . many recent reports have addressed the structure of fae <dig> and its relationship to brassica genomes and seed erucic acid contents. a full cdna for this gene, as well as the genomic dna and predicted promoter sequences, are readily available from genbank. using this information, full length genomic fae <dig> sequences were cloned by screening the b. napus bac library with one fragment probe of this gene, and two paralogous fae <dig> in the genome were found  <cit> . two major qtls were detected using a reference doubled haploid mapping population  originating from a chinese high erucic acid  cultivar, b. napus cv. ningyou <dig>  and a european low erucic acid  cultivar, b. napus cv. tapidor. these two qtls, one located on linkage group/chromosome a <dig>  and the other on c <dig> , accounted for ~71% of the genetic variation  <cit> . with developed polymorphic markers and the tndh mapping population, the two paralogues were regarded as genes under the two qtls for seed erucic acid contents  <cit> . similar findings were reported by rahman et al.  <cit> . in  <dig> and  <dig>  one snp was found in fae <dig> between a high and a low erucic acid content b. napus cultivar  <cit> , and this was also reported by nath et al.  <cit> . in addition, a four-base nucleotide deletion within the fae <dig> coding region in an lea compared to an hea cultivar was reported. expression these hea and lea fae <dig> genes in yeast indicated that the snp or indel causes the differences in erucic acid content  <cit> . the b. rapa  and b. oleracea  genomes also have paralogous fae <dig> s  <cit> .

ecotilling is a new approach developed from tilling  and is mainly used to detect snps in natural populations. the first successful application of ecotilling was to detect variations in several genes in a natural arabidopsis population in  <dig>  <cit> . many snps in a dozen genes were also identified in wild populations of populus trichocarpa  <cit> . several reports have indicated that ecotilling is a highly efficient approach to detecting genetic variations associated with target traits for crop improvement. nieto et al. detected one haplotype comprising several grouped snps controlling virus susceptibility in a natural melon population. key snps in the resistance gene were also identified and these may be exploited for resistance breeding  <cit> . however, despite several reports on ecotilling, it is relatively difficult to apply the technique to crop improvement, especially for polyploid plants with complex genomes.

here we report the application of ecotilling to the identification of lea cultivars among natural populations of three brassica species. about  <dig> accessions of modern cultivars of b. napus, seven of b. rapa and nine of b. oleracea were collected. variations in the two paralogous, b. napus fae1s, among these cultivars were detected using ecotilling. in total, three snps/indels were found to be associated with differences in seed erucic acid contents. a new lea genetic resource was found in the natural b. rapa population using sequence alignment. analysis of the evolutionary relationships and sequence similarities among these three brassica species showed a closer pedigree relationship between the brassica a and c genomes than between the a/c genomes and arabidopsis genome;  <dig> snps were found in the coding region of fae <dig> and may be used as genome-specific markers to differentiate the a and c genomes.

RESULTS
 <dig>  phenotyping for erucic acid contents of seeds of brassica accessions
one hundred and one accessions of b. napus cultivars were collected, mostly modern cultivars. many of them perform excellently in terms of key traits such as oil content, fatty acid composition, yield and so on. these accessions were derived from different geographic origins:  <dig> from china,  <dig> from sweden,  <dig> from germany,  <dig> from france,  <dig> from australia,  <dig> from canada,  <dig> from denmark,  <dig> from poland, and  <dig> from unknown regions . to learn more about the lea genetic resource, the original lea ancestors of b. napus, 'liho' and 'oro', were also collected. seven accessions of b. rapa   and nine of b. oleracea  were also collected .

a <dig> indicates the position  <dig> bp from the base 'a' in the start codon of b. rapa fae <dig>  p197=b indicates amino acid diversity due to this nucleotide polymorphism. c <dig> indicates the position  <dig> bp from the base 'a' in the start codon of b. oleracea fae <dig>  three haplotypes of fae <dig> can be inferred among these seven b. rapa accessions. accessions nos. 1- <dig> are b. rapa haplotype 1; accession no.  <dig> is b. rapa haplotype  <dig> and accession no.  <dig> is b. rapa haplotype  <dig>  seven haplotypes of fae <dig> can be inferred among these nine b. oleracea accessions. accessions nos.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are b. oleracea haplotype 1; accessions no.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are b. oleracea haplotypes  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively.

the erucic acid contents of the seeds of the  <dig> b. napus accessions ranged from approximately zero to more than 57% . in  <dig> accessions, the erucic acid contents were between zero and 10%; in one, between 10% and 20%; in eight, between 20% and 30%; in five, between 30% and 40%; and in  <dig>  more than 40%. thus, the collection comprised b. napus pools with low, medium and high erucic acid contents in seeds. in the seven b. rapa accessions, two were lea with almost zero erucic acid contents . we found no lea accession among the nine cultivars of b. oleracea .

 <dig>  fae <dig> polymorphisms in the three brassica species
two paralogous fae <dig> s were cloned by wang et al.  <cit>  through screening the b. napus bac library. they were designated as bn.fae1-a <dig> and bn.fae1-c <dig>  open reading frame  analysis indicated that the coding regions of the two fae <dig> paralogues were  <dig> bp long with no intron and the similarity between them in the hea b. napus cv. ningyou <dig> genome was  <dig> %. using primer pairs designed according to these sequences  and ecotilling, polymorphisms were detected in the  <dig> b. napus accessions. overall, one position in bn.fae1-a <dig> showed polymorphism and two positions in bn.fae1-c <dig> showed polymorphisms in the coding regions. using ecotilling, seven accessions were identified individually as heterozygous on bn.fae1-a <dig> or bn.fae1-c <dig>  figure  <dig> illustrates the polymorphisms in the second half region of bn.fae1-c <dig> with ecotilling screening.

to confirm these ecotilling results, we randomly sequenced 5- <dig> samples of each polymorphism and confirmed them at all the positions tested. in total,  <dig> sequences were obtained; ten of these were selected to confirm the polymorphism on bn.fae1-a <dig> ; nine were selected to confirm the two polymorphisms on bn.fae1-c <dig> . the sequencing results showed that the polymorphic locus of bn.fae1-a <dig> was at  <dig> bp.  in some accessions the position was c; in others it was t . two polymorphic loci of bn.fae1-c  <dig> were located at 1368- <dig> bp  and 1422- <dig> bp . additional file  <dig> shows the positions of all the polymorphisms within the hea fae <dig> coding region.

two primer pairs, fae1-rapa and fae1-olearacea, were selected to amplify the genomic fae <dig> sequences of b. rapa and b. oleracea, respectively . sequencing of the pcr products from each sample of b. rapa revealed six polymorphisms in the fae <dig> coding regions of the seven b. rapa accessions . different geographical origins may contribute to sequence differences because five accessions from china had identical sequences and the other two, one from australia and one from finland, had different sequences. five polymorphisms in the coding regions of fae <dig> were detected from chinese accessions of b. oleracea which showed much greater divergence .

 <dig>  association of fae <dig> polymorphisms with differences in seed erucic acid contents among the three brassica species
according to the ecotilling results that identified fae <dig> polymorphisms in the  <dig> b. napus accessions, two haplotypes of bn.fae1-a <dig> and four of bn.fae1-c <dig> were inferred. the sequences with nucleotide c and t in the  <dig> bp position on bn.fae1-a <dig> were designated haplotype a8-h <dig> and a8-h <dig>  respectively. no deletion of bn.fae1-c <dig> was designated haplotype c3-h <dig>  a four-base  deletion in bn.fae1-c <dig> 1368- <dig> bp and a two-base  deletion in bn.fae1-c <dig> 1422- <dig> bp were designated c3-h <dig> and c3-h <dig>  respectively. a haplotype with deletions in both positions  was named c3-h <dig> . the reference accession b. napus cv. huayou <dig> contained a8-h <dig> and c3-h <dig> in its genome and was an hea cultivar. furthermore, we found that when the nucleotide changed from c  to t  in fae <dig>  the predicted translated amino acid changed from serine to phenylalanine. both deletions in bn.fae1-c <dig> led to premature stop codon in the predicted orf.

the erucic acid content of a8-h <dig> seeds  was significantly higher than that of a8-h <dig>  according to anova  and an lsd  all-pairwise comparison test , indicating that c in the  <dig> bp position of bn.fae1-a <dig> is essential for gene function and t may result in loss of function. we found that c3-h <dig>  c3-h <dig>  c3-h <dig>  c3-h <dig>  were also significantly associated with differences in seed erucic acid contents . the erucic acid content related to c3-h <dig>  was far higher than that in the other three haplotypes. the erucic acid content of c3-h <dig> seeds  was significantly lower than that of c3-h <dig> , showing that the two-base  deletion at 1422- <dig> bp in bn.fae1-c <dig> inhibited erucic acid synthesis more efficiently that the four-base  deletion at 1368- <dig> bp. the erucic acid content of haplotype c3-h <dig> , which harboured both deletions in bn.fae1-c <dig>  was significantly lower than those of c3-h <dig> and c3-h <dig>  which harboured one but not both of the deletions. in conclusion, nucleotide c at the  <dig> bp position of bn.fae1-a <dig> is essential for gene function and t might lead to loss of function; the two premature stop codons resulting from the two deletions on bn.fae1-c <dig> might also cause loss of function.

too few b. rapa and b. oleracea samples were collected for anova to be applied to their data. alignment of the seven fae <dig> coding sequences of b. rapa showed that three fae <dig> haplotypes can be inferred. accession nos. 1- <dig> were b. rapa haplotype  <dig>  accession no.  <dig> was haplotype  <dig> and accession no.  <dig> haplotype  <dig> . three of the six polymorphisms were found at positions  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp , and these may be associated with differences in the erucic acid contents of seeds. plants with nucleotide g at  <dig> bp and c at  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in b. rapa fae <dig> had high seed erucic acid contents; those with a at  <dig> bp and t at  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp had low contents. the nucleotide changes at  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp did not alter the amino acids predicted from the orf, but when the c changed to t at  <dig> bp, the corresponding amino acid changed from threonine to isoleucine. thus, the difference at position  <dig> bp in fae <dig> may have caused the phenotypic difference. comparing these findings with the nucleotide change in position  <dig> bp in the a genome of b. napus, it may be concluded that the lea genetic resources in the a genomes in our collection differed between b. rapa and b. napus.

alignment of the nine b. oleracea fae <dig> coding sequences indicated seven haplotypes. accessions nos.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were b. oleracea haplotype 1; accessions nos.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were b. oleracea  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively . five polymorphisms were found in these nine fae <dig> coding regions . since no lea accession was collected for b. oleracea in this study, no rule could be found for the genotypes of the hea accessions of this species.

 <dig>  evolutionary relationship of fae <dig> among the three brassica species
in order to investigate the pedigree relationship among the different brassica species and explore the genetic basis of the lea genetic resource, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using  <dig> fae <dig> sequences: six b. napus fae <dig> haplotypes, seven b. oleracea haplotypes, three b. rapa haplotyes, and one arabidopsis sequence . this phyogenetic tree indicated that the divergence between the a and c genome fae <dig> s occurred later than that between arabidopsis and brassica species, which is consistent with other reports  <cit> . the tree also showed that the fae <dig> sequences of the a genome formed two groups, viz. the sequences from b. napus and b. rapa. however, the c genome revealed more complex groups, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the pedigree relationship. in addition,  <dig> snps differed between the a and c genomes, as shown by multiple alignments of  <dig> fae <dig> sequences from the three brassica species . analysis of these snps showed that many restriction enzymes could distinguish between the a and c genomes. changes in the nucleotides of  <dig> of these  <dig> snps led to no changes in the amino acid encoded.

discussion
ecotilling, a method developed from tilling , was successfully applied to b. napus, which is considered one of the most complex polyploid plants. we may infer that ecotilling is a very powerful method for identifying polymorphisms and for association mapping and developing functional markers for crops. however, gene-specific primer design is the key step for successful application of ecotilling to crop improvement. from the first application of tilling to arabidopsis  <cit> , many studies have detailed the difficulty of developing primers for tilling and ecotilling for crops, because most crops harbour very complex genomes and genomic sequence information is insufficient  <cit> . of course, it is relatively easy to design gene-specific primers for plants that have been completely sequenced, such as arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . two procedures for developing primers for tilling and ecotilling have been reported for crops with complex genomes. first, gene-specific primers can be designed according to sequence differences among multi-copy genes if the relevant genomic information is obtained. most tilling and ecotilling studies have been carried out using this procedure  <cit> . secondly, co-amplified primers can be used for genes that are present in multiple copies and show minor sequence differences among paralogues. two studies have successfully applied this procedure in tilling and ecotilling  <cit> . in the present study, genomic sequence information was obtained first, and then gene-specific primers were designed for the two paralogues of fae <dig> 

it has been reported that erucic acid is an antinutritional component of seed oil  <cit> . therefore, a major objective for rapeseed breeding is to achieve and apply genetic resources with low seed erucic acid contents. during the 1960s, the first lea b. napus germplasm was found in an animal feed rape 'liho', and then the first b. napus lea cultivar 'oro' was developed by introducing an lea genetic resource from 'liho'  <cit> . as far as we know, no other lea genetic resource for breeders has been reported. in this research, we investigated the lea resources in a collection of  <dig> modern b. napus accessions. the polymorphisms found for bn.fae1-a <dig> and bn.fae1-c <dig> readily revealed the snps/indels associated with differences in seed erucic acid contents. thus, our results are consistent with other studies showing that snps/indels in fae <dig> corresponded to loss of function of this gene in yeast  <cit> . however, comparing these snps/indels to the first lea germplams 'liho' and 'oro', we could find only one polymorphisim  which may be a new lea resource. but this deletion was also on the background of the original lea germplams 'liho' and 'oro'. this indicated that no more other lea resource came out during the past  <dig> years. therefore, the lea genetic resource for b. napus is not sufficient and more are required to avoid genetic erosion.

new lea mutants with a high erucic acid content genetic background were obtained by screening a large b. napus ems mutant population with tilling  <cit> . this would be a very efficient method for augmenting lea genetic resources. in this study, one new lea genetic resource in b. rapa was also found, which differed from that in b. napus. there have been many successful reports about the exchange of beneficial traits among six brassica species in the u'triangle  <cit> . thus, the lea genetic resource from b. rapa could be introduced to b. napus to improve this crop.

the all-pairwise comparison test revealed differences in seed erucic acid contents, related to the four haplotypes of bn.fae1-c <dig> in our b. napus collection. both the two-base deletion at 1422- <dig> bp and the four-base deletion at 1367- <dig> bp affected bn.fae1-c <dig> function. the two-base deletion reduced the seed erucic acid content more efficiently than the four-base deletion, and the combination of the two deletions knocked out gene function  more effectively than either deletion alone. thus, to take advantage of these lea resources, it would be better to introduce both deletions into the target plants so as to breed cultivars with less erucic acid in the seeds.

in the molecular evolutionary analysis of the fae <dig> sequences of the three brassica species and arabidopsis, we found  <dig> snps that differed between the a and c genomes. fifteen of these  <dig> snps are silent variations and the original types of brassica species with a full function of fae <dig> which could produce high erucic acid in seeds. from these results, we may deduce that it is difficult for plants with loss of functional fae <dig> to survive long in evolution. in other words, plants with higher seed erucic acid contents have a greater capacity to adapt to the environment.

CONCLUSIONS
ecotilling has been successfully applied to the identification of fae <dig> variations in brassica. polymorphisms in bn.fae1-a <dig> and bn.fae1-c <dig> were strongly associated with differences in the erucic acid contents of seeds. different nucleotide deletions in bn. fae1-c <dig> reduced the erucic acid content to different degrees. the discovery of a new lea resource enlarged the pool of genetic resources and could be used for lea breeding.
