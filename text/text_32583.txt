BACKGROUND
flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylases  and flavonoid 3'-hydroxylases  are versatile enzymes that accept several phenylpropanoid substrates  <cit> . of particular interest for anthocyanin pigmentation is the 3',5'- or 3'-hydroxylation of naringenin and dihydrokaempferol. f3'5'hs and f3'hs compete for substrate recruitment and deliver their 3'5'- or 3'-oh products into the parallel synthesis of delphinidin and cyanidin  <cit> , the precursors of blue and red anthocyanins in grape berries, respectively. variation in anthocyanin profile within and between grape varieties is associated with differences in the ratio of f3'5'h to f3'h expression  <cit> .

anthocyanin biosynthesis takes place over 8- <dig> weeks, from shortly after berry softening  until harvest  <cit> . f3'hs are expressed at comparable levels in both anthocyanin-pigmented and green-skinned varieties, before and after the onset of ripening  <cit> . however, regulation of f3'5'hs is largely genotype-specific and responsive to environmental cues  <cit> . the breadth of diversity in fruit colour among different grapevine accessions suggests a fine regulation of f3'5'h expression. dark blue cultivars transcribe f3'5'hs at higher levels than light red cultivars, which nevertheless maintain traces of 3'5'-oh anthocyanins and barely detectable f3'5'h transcripts. in green-skinned cultivars, f3'5'h transcripts are completely absent  <cit> . the invariant presence of some 3'5'-oh anthocyanins in red pigmented grapes contrasts with many other flowering plants such as roses, carnations, chrysanthemums, lilies, gerbera, and arabidopsis, which accumulate anthocyanins but do not synthesise 3'5'-oh derivatives.

the lack of grapevines with f3'5'h loss-of-function genotypes could be explained either by selection, which acted against knockout mutations, or by gene redundancy, which obscured the effect of single-gene loss/silencing. the observation that an absence of 3'5'-oh anthocyanins is generally tolerated in plants disfavours the first hypothesis. furthermore, gene redundancy of f3'5'hs is commonplace in grape genomes  <cit> , contrasting with most other species that have single or two-copy f3'5'hs, or none at all. we have previously shown that f3'5'hs are highly duplicated, with multiple copies arrayed in clustered contigs of the 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map  <cit> . the genome assembly of the nearly-homozygous line pn <dig>  <cit>  allows a deeper investigation into the structure of the f3'5'h locus and into the evolutionary events that caused their proliferation in grapevine.

expansion of gene families is common in plant genomes  <cit> , and results from various mechanisms of duplication: whole-genome duplication , segmental duplication, tandem duplication, and transpositional duplication  <cit> . wgds have repeatedly occurred over evolutionary time in the common ancestor of eudicots and in specific lineages  <cit> . segmental duplications occur over chromosomal regions, which may undergo subsequent rearrangement. tandem duplications generate nearby gene copies  <cit> . small-scale duplications may also cause transposition of one of the duplicate genes to an ectopic site. in this paper, local duplications of small fragments  containing a single gene are referred to as tandem duplications. duplication of dna blocks > <dig> kb are referred to as segmental duplications.

retention of duplicate genes results from a stochastic process, in which the effect of the earliest mutation occurring after duplication governs the fate of extra copies. deleterious mutations occur much more frequently than mutations resulting in novel and favourable functions  <cit> . following this assumption, gene disruption would largely prevail, with genomes populated by vestiges of ancient duplicates. this raises the question as to why intact duplicates are maintained and expressed much more frequently than expected by chance. according to the duplication-degeneration-complementation  model  <cit> , degenerative mutations promote preservation of duplicate genes. deleterious mutations in regulatory regions could eliminate different cis-elements in either duplicate, making both copies necessary to provide the full-complement of the expression profile of the ancestral single copy  <cit> . this kind of partitioned expression among duplicate genes is referred to as subfunctionalisation, and includes differential expression among organs and developmental stages, or in response to environmental cues  <cit> .

duplicate genes involved in secondary metabolism or that are responsive to environmental stimuli appear to be more frequently maintained  <cit> , and have more highly diverged transcriptional patterns and intraspecific variation in expression  <cit>  than duplicate genes in other categories. the pioneering study of  <cit>  provided a paradigmatic case of duplication and transcriptional diversification in members of the stilbene synthase gene family in grapevine. it is generally assumed that maintenance of duplicate genes provides a foundation for consolidation and refinement of established functions, particularly in secondary metabolism, by preserving extra copies that guarantee a gene reservoir for adaptive evolution, free from the constraints of purifying selection  <cit> .

in this paper, we present  the evolutionary path that led to the structural architecture of the f3'5'h gene family in grapevine,  the transcriptional sub-functionalisation of duplicate copies among organs and developmental stages, and  the extent of variation of expression patterns in four cultivars with divergent anthocyanin profiles.

RESULTS
f3'5'hs and f3'hs in grapevine: genomic location and phylogeny
sixteen copies of f3'5'hs are present in the pn <dig> genome. each f3'5'h copy is referred to as f3'5'ha through f3'5'hp, with the alphabetical order reflecting their genomic coordinates . fifteen of them  reside in a tandem array within a 650-kb region on chromosome   <dig>  this chromosomal region is syntenic with the homoeologous chr <dig> and  <dig> in poplar, and with supercontig <dig> in papaya . an isolated f3'5'h copy  resides on grapevine chr <dig>  a chromosome that was homoeologous to chr <dig> in the paleohexaploid ancestor  <cit> . however, other genes in a 100-kb interval around f3'5'hp are single-copy, and not collinear with genes in the region on chr <dig> surrounding the other f3'5'hs . f3'5'hp is an orphan gene that lacks orthologues in other sequenced dicots and in est databases. in poplar, one or both homoeologous loci syntenic with the grapevine f3'5'hp region, which are present in the homoeologous chr <dig> and chr <dig> generated by the salicoid wgd  <cit> , have maintained the collinear genes present in grapevine, except for f3'5'hp .

seven f3'5'hs on grapevine chr <dig>  and f3'5'hp on chr <dig> encode full-length proteins. in the haplotype of pn <dig>  the remainder gene models are either gene fragments without homology outside of conserved regions, or coding regions interrupted by transposable elements  or frameshift indels .

grapevine contains two copies of f3'h  located in a 25-kb interval on chr <dig> . f3'hs reside in two blocks of ~ <dig> kb, which share  <dig> % identity over  <dig>  kb of conserved sequence, separated by ~ <dig> kb largely consisting of repetitive elements. both f3'hs encode full-length proteins. f3'ha and f3'hb share 97% amino acid identity, but their genomic sequences differ extensively due to a large indel in the terminal intron . other genes surrounding the two f3'h copies on chr <dig> are not collinear with genes surrounding f3'hs on chr <dig> or on chr <dig> 

f3'5'h and f3'h gene phylogeny was analysed using translated sequences from six completely sequenced plant genomes and samples from other species, totalling  <dig> angiosperms and one gymnosperm . all f3'5'hs split from f3'hs. all grapevine f3'5'hs are highly conserved within the f3'5'h group. all of those located in the gene array on chr <dig> tightly group into a single major cluster. the more divergent f3'5'ho, which resides at the distal side of the array on chr <dig>  and the orphan f3'5'hp on chr <dig> lie in deep-node branches . subclades were identified within the major cluster based on maximum parsimony analysis of the coding sequences . timing of divergence among duplicate f3'5'hs was estimated by four-fold synonymous third-codon transversion values  . the earliest duplication that gave rise to f3'5'hp and the founder of all other f3'5'hs on chr <dig> occurred synchronously with the event of γ hexaploidisation . in the chr <dig> array, f3'5'ho has extensively diverged from the progenitor of adjacent f3'5'hs, with 4dtv between gene pairs at  <dig>  ±  <dig> . most of the recurrent duplications in the array have occurred much more recently, generating two groups of copies that diverged at 4dtv ~ <dig>  containing highly similar copies within each group . f3'5'hk likely arose by illegitimate recombination between two paralogues that diverged at 4dtv ~ <dig> , as reflected by its intermediate 4dtv value  and by the asymmetric distribution of 4dtv sites along f3'5'hk, when compared with members of either group .

the two copies of grapevine f3'h grouped tightly . f3'hs are consistently present in one or a few copies across fully sequenced plant species.

evolution of the f3'5'h locus on chromosome 6
the pattern and mode of gene duplication were characterised through several approaches:  dot plot self-comparison of the entire locus,  conservation of non-coding sequences, te patterns, and sequence divergence between long terminal repeats  of retrotransposons in duplicate blocks,  level of identity between 10-kb windows around each f3'5'h,  intron divergence between the most recent duplicated f3'5'hs, and  conservation of duplicate f3'5'hs across the family vitaceae.

a dot plot self-comparison of the locus identified  <dig> blocks of dna ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, each containing one or two copies of f3'5'h at the forefront of the block . the remaining f3'5'h copies in this locus  are located downstream of the segmental duplications. duplicated blocks do not contain genes other than f3'5'hs and are largely composed of repetitive dna .

blocks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> share 90-99% nucleotide identity, and each contain a cacta and a gypsy te . the ubiquitous presence of this gypsy element across these blocks and the nucleotide substitution rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  between its ltrs date the gypsy insertion to the ancestral single-copy sequence, recently in the evolutionary history of vitaceae. the present-day block  <dig> is more reminiscent of the ancestral state of the sequence that initiated segmental duplications than blocks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  as evidenced by the wide conservation of block  <dig> sequences among all of the other blocks, and by the fact that all of the other blocks resemble block  <dig> with various structural modifications. blocks  <dig> and  <dig> resemble block  <dig> except for vestiges of a gypsy element in the middle of the block. block  <dig> is nearly identical to block  <dig>  except for a recent gypsy insertion into the shared gypsy element. sequence divergence between ltrs of this nested gypsy is  <dig> . block  <dig> has undergone the most rearrangements, including hat and gypsy insertions at the extremities of the block, and two gypsy invasions upstream and downstream of the proximal cacta with low divergence between their ltrs . block  <dig> has ~ <dig> kb of extra dna with respect to block  <dig> due to a copia insertion and a nested gypsy insertion into the shared cacta. with respect to block  <dig>  block  <dig> has an additional cacta. blocks  <dig> and  <dig> differ extensively from all other blocks and share  <dig> % identity with each other . a mutator insertion predated the duplication of their common ancestor. in block  <dig>  a gypsy element has moved into the mutator shared with block  <dig>  and a copia with  <dig>  divergence between its ltrs has invaded the distal side. block  <dig> was invaded by a gypsy element with identical ltrs and by a copia with  <dig>  genetic distance between its ltrs.

sequence conservation in a 10-kb window surrounding each f3'5'h copy supports the hypothesis that most of the copies were generated by duplications of the entire segment in which they reside , with the following exceptions. downstream of the segmental duplications, sequence similarity between the nearly identical copies f3'5'hm and f3'5'hn does not extend more than ~  <dig> kb beyond each side of their coding regions. f3'5'hk and -l are both located upstream of block  <dig>  f3'5'hl and its 5' non-coding region are dissimilar from the paralogous f3'5'h in duplicate blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  as though f3'5'hl originated from a small scale duplication of f3'5'hg, -m, or -n. f3'5'ho, the copy at the far extremity of the locus, shares low similarity only upstream of the coding region with f3'5'ha, -b, -c, -d, -e, and -h. f3'5'hp, the copy on chr <dig>  has no similarity outside of the coding region with other f3'5'hs.

intronic sequences of highly similar paralogous f3'5'hs reflect the relatedness of the entirety of the duplicated block in which each f3'5'h resides . the few f3'5'hs that lie in pairs at the forefront of a duplicate block  are less similar within the pair than with a member of a different pair. thus, paired f3'5'hs at the forefront of blocks  <dig> and  <dig> originated from an ectopic duplication before the duplication of the corresponding segment. the absence of intronless f3'5'hs excluded a role for retroposition in the process of gene duplication.

conservation of duplicate f3'5'hs in the family vitaceae was assayed by pcr with copy-specific primers. the orphan f3'5'hp gene on chr <dig> was detected in the genera parthenocissus and vitis, while it was faintly amplified in ampelopsis, likely due to more divergent priming sites . in contrast, only a few primer pairs that amplified the most recent duplicate genes in vitis genomes yielded amplicons in parthenocissus or ampelopsis. a wide sample of cultivars and species within the genus vitis bears the marks of that expansion , including wine and table cultivars of vitis vinifera, asian and american vitis species, and the muscadine grape.

prediction of functional domains among duplicate f3'5'hs
according to  <cit>  and  <cit> , six functional domains in the f3'5'h enzyme are important for the determination of substrate specificity and 3' vs. 3'5'-oh activity . f3'5'ha, -c, -e, and -h are truncated in the pn <dig> genome, and lack one or more functional domains . all other grapevine f3'5'hs except f3'5'ho have invariant amino acids specific for 3'5'-hydroxylation activity. in plants, f3'5'hs are conserved at three critical positions in the cr <dig>  and at two positions in the srs <dig>  . all grapevine f3'5'hs that diverged less than 4dtv ~ <dig>  show complete amino acid conservation at the cr <dig> and srs <dig> domains. f3'5'hp on chr <dig> and f3'5'ho, -m, and -n, the most divergent copies in the f3'5'h array on chr <dig>  have a met-to-ile substitution at cr <dig> position  <dig> with respect to other paralogues. this substitution is shared with f3'5'hs in grasses. f3'5'ho also has an ala-to-thr substitution at srs <dig> position  <dig>  which is shared with corn and sorghum f3'5'hs, as well as with most of the f3'hs. f3'5'hp has an ala-to-val substitution at the same position, which is uniquely shared with f3'5'hs from orchids. f3'5'ho has extensively diverged from all other f3'5'hs at srs <dig> and srs <dig>  while f3'5'hp has peculiar amino acid substitutions at srs <dig>  srs <dig>  and srs <dig> 

variation in promoter regions of duplicate f3'5'hs
duplicate f3'5'hs have originated from segmental duplications of large dna blocks, which included the coding sequences and several kilobases of the surrounding dna. in some cases, reorganisation of promoter regions within 2-kb upstream of the start codon occurred via te insertion, for example copia and hat elements in the common ancestor of the present-day f3'5'hc and -e duplicates. in other cases , structural variation in the promoter was caused by insertions/deletions of dna segments of variable length up to a few hundred nucleotides, which do not belong to any annotated class of repetitive elements. these inserted/deleted portions are neither detected by algorithms of repetitive dna search such as reas, nor are they duplicated elsewhere in the genome based on blastn searches. structural variation in the promoters of f3'5'hs often occurred in a complementary fashion among gene copies, with a segment of one promoter having been lost in one duplicate but maintained in another, and vice versa. comparison among triplets of promoters indicated that those segments were more often conserved in two f3'5'hs and absent from the third one than vice versa. all of this evidence excludes a mechanism of copy-and-paste insertion in the promoter of either duplicate gene, and favours the alternative hypothesis that structural deletions in the promoters of daughter copies have progressively degenerated the original sequence of the ancestral single-copy gene, partitioning the full complement of the regulatory information among copies.

deletions may have asymmetrically erased cis-elements from regulatory regions of duplicate f3'5'hs. thus, the 2-kb promoter regions of duplicate f3'5'hs were searched for dna-binding motifs . segments that were alternatively maintained in either promoter contained binding sites for myb-type transcription factors, light-responsive and drought-inducible cis-elements, motifs sensitive to aba and methyl-jasmonate, and heat stress responsive motifs. relatedness between the alignable regions of duplicate promoters was also evident from a phylogenetic tree .

spatial expression patterns of duplicate f3'5'hs and f3'hs
expression analyses were conducted on nine out of the sixteen f3'5'h copies for which primer pairs could individually distinguish each paralogue and that passed the thresholds of pcr efficiency as set in the methods section.

duplicate f3'5'hs are asymmetrically expressed across organs  . the orphan copy f3'5'hp is highly expressed in all vegetative organs  and very weakly in fruit. the highly duplicated f3'5'hs that reside in segmental duplications on chr <dig> are preferentially expressed in berry skin. expression of f3'5'hm, -n, and -o, three copies located outside of the segmentally duplicated region on chr <dig>  was detectable in some vegetative organs, but not in berry skin during ripening in all cultivars tested . in fruit, none of the f3'5'hs that are expressed in cultivars accumulating anthocyanins  are expressed during ripening in the green-skinned cultivar 'tocai' .

f3'ha is widely expressed in many organs . in berry skins, f3'ha expression increased 2-fold at full veraison, and then remained constant during the later stages of ripening . transcripts of f3'hb were never detected in the organs analysed in this study  and weak expression of this copy was detected exclusively in adventitious roots of 'cabernet sauvignon'  <cit> .

expression of the f3'5'h gene family and variation of anthocyanin profiles across different cultivars
berries of four cultivars were sampled at eight developmental stages in order to quantify cumulative expression of the f3'5'h gene family and relative contribution of individual f3'5'h copies, and to determine anthocyanin profiles. the accessions 'aglianico', 'grignolino', 'marzemino', and 'nebbiolo' were chosen for their contrasting phenotypes of fruit colour, based on literature reports  <cit> .

as a whole, expression of the f3'5'h gene family levelled off before veraison , in step with other genes of the flavonoid pathway  <cit> . f3'5'hs became increasingly more expressed at 10% veraison, peaking at full-veraison and ten days after full-veraison. expression then declined two weeks before harvest and at harvest, but remained at higher levels than those detected before the onset of ripening.

cumulative expression of all duplicate f3'5'hs indicated that the cultivar 'aglianico' had significantly greater f3'5'h expression during ripening than other cultivars. cumulative f3'5'h expression in 'aglianico' was 3-fold higher than in 'marzemino', and almost 20-fold higher than in 'grignolino' and 'nebbiolo'. 'aglianico' and 'marzemino' yielded dark grape skin extracts , with the highest concentrations of anthocyanins , and their anthocyanin profiles were predominantly composed of 3'5'-oh anthocyanins  . 'grignolino' and 'nebbiolo' produced reddish skin extracts, with anthocyanin profiles depleted in 3'5'-oh anthocyanins .

the level of expression of every f3'5'h copy was highly variable in berry skin of different cultivars . as a result, the contribution of individual gene copies to the f3'5'h transcript pool was unique to each cultivar. pcr efficiency differences across cultivars are inherent when dealing with four heterozygous grapevine accessions of unrelated pedigree, due to possible nucleotide divergence across the eight haplotypes. for each f3'5'h primer pair we assessed that the standard deviation of pcr efficiency among cultivars is less than 10%, and it is therefore unlikely to explain these results. a two-way anova identified significant differences in relative transcript levels among duplicate f3'5'hs within each cultivar. f3'5'hf was the predominately expressed copy in 'aglianico'. pcr efficiency for this copy in 'aglianico' was  <dig> %, which is within the bounds of the standard deviation of the average pcr efficiency of this gene family in the same cultivar . f3'5'hi was the predominately expressed copy in 'nebbiolo', and also in 'grignolino' together with f3'5'hf. in contrast, f3'5'hj expression predominated in 'marzemino'. f3'5'hg, -h, -l, and -p were consistently expressed at lower levels across all cultivars, despite the observation that pcr efficiencies of their primer pairs were not lower than other f3'5'h copies in the accessions under study. traces of transcripts of the copies f3'5'hm, -n, and -o were never detected in the preliminary semiquantitative pcr screening at any stage of berry ripening in any of the accessions tested, even when pcr products were stained with silver nitrate for high sensitivity. thus, they were excluded from further investigation by qpcr.

a three-way anova was used to decouple and test the significance of three factors that contributed to the observed variation of expression patterns: gene-copy, cultivar, and developmental stage . all three factors were significant, as well as the interactions: gene-copy × developmental stage, gene-copy × cultivar, cultivar × developmental stage, and gene-copy × cultivar × developmental stage .

distinct temporal expression patterns of duplicate f3'5'hs during ripening
individual gene copies were differentially regulated during ripening. differences in the expression pattern of individual f3'5'hs with regard to developmental time were statistically significant in each of the four varieties, separately analysed by one-way anova and when averaged across cultivars . f3'5'hi and -j were expressed early, and attained a peak of expression between full-veraison and ten days post-veraison, consistently among cultivars. late in ripening, f3'5'h expression was predominated by transcripts of f3'5'hf, -g ,-h, and -l.

discussion
expansion of the f3'5'h family in grapevine
gene-copy number of f3'5'hs has increased in the grapevine lineage through recurrent cycles of duplication. the most ancient duplication resulted in two f3'5'h loci. one of these, f3'5'hp, has been maintained as a single-copy gene on chr <dig> in grapevine and other vitaceae but lost from other dicot genomes. the other was the founder of the present-day f3'5'h gene array on chr <dig>  orthologous to the f3'5'hs expressed in other dicot species and syntenic with the f3'5'h loci found in poplar and papaya . the 4dtv distance between f3'5'hp and other f3'5'h copies is close to the peak of 4dtv distances between grape paleologues observed by tang and coworkers  <cit>  . timing of the earliest f3'5'h duplication is therefore coincident with the event of eudicot γ hexaploidy  <cit> , and the chromosomes in which the duplicate genes reside are indeed paleologous chromosomes  <cit> .

the orphan copy f3'5'hp is predominantly expressed in grape vegetative organs, in contrast with the f3'5'h copies on chr <dig>  which are predominantly expressed in fruit . several amino acid substitutions in f3'5'hp are shared with f3'hs and monocot f3'5'hs. for instance, f3'5'hs are present in many monocot species, but in all cases studied, their transcription is uncoupled from the expression of other genes in the anthocyanin pathway. as a result monocots seldom accumulate 3'5'-oh anthocyanins  <cit> . for example, seed coats of rice varieties with dark red pigmentation contain exclusively 3'-oh anthocyanins, and the same holds true for sorghum and purple corn. 3'5'-oh anthocyanins are also absent in blue flowers of dendrobium and phalaenopsis orchids, albeit the detection of 3'5'-oh flavonols provides evidence for f3'5'h activity  <cit> .

expansion of f3'5'hs on chr <dig> occurred in the vitaceae lineage after the separation from other dicots. indeed, f3'5'h genes are present in low copy number in other fully sequenced plant genomes, if not lost. f3'5'h is absent from arabidopsis, single-copy in rice and papaya, and dual-copy in poplar and sorghum. in poplar, the two copies of f3'5'h were generated by the salicoid wgd  <cit> . the presence of a single-copy gene in the syntenic locus of poplar and papaya , and molecular dating of grapevine paralogues favour the hypothesis of lineage-specific gene duplications. the estimated age of f3'5'h duplications based on transversion rate at four-fold synonymous third-codon positions predicts most duplicate copies having diverged by less than 4dtv ~ <dig>  . if the molecular clock in grape is approximately calibrated by comparing the evolutionary rates in perennial dicots, the 4dtv distance of ~ <dig>  in grape is roughly half of the median 4dtv distance  observed in poplar between duplicate genes that arose from the 60- <dig> myr-old salicoid duplication  <cit> . however, grape has evolved more slowly than poplar, and the distances between paleologous genes that arose from the γ triplication are lower in grape  than in poplar , as estimated by  <cit> . thus, recalibrating the mutation rate in grape, the 4dtv distances between f3'5'h in the chr <dig> array suggest that most duplications occurred within the past ~ <dig> myr.

molecular dating based on rate of nucleotide divergence is consistent with the conservation of duplicate gene copies across lineages in the family vitaceae. while most of the 4dtv ~ <dig>  copies are conserved among vitis species, they failed to be amplified from the dna of related genera ampelopsis and parthenocissus. conversely, the paleologous f3'5'hp was conserved among these genera. fossil records from the late cretaceous dates the radiation of vitis, ampelopsis, and parthenocissus genera back to ~ <dig> mya  <cit> , confirming that most of the f3'5'h expansion occurred in an ancestor of the vitis lineage, after the separation from the related lineages ampelopsis and parthenocissus.

the founder of the array of f3'5'hs on chr <dig> was initially duplicated through tandem gene duplication. subsequently, different f3'5'h copies were involved in reiterated segmental duplications of large dna blocks in which they resided, generating  <dig> blocks that range in size from ~ <dig> to  <dig> kb . this modular structure suggests that unequal crossing-over between mispaired blocks was the most likely force that shaped the locus. subsequent reorganisation via te insertion, deletion, etc., resulted in structural variation among blocks, which might have reduced illegitimate recombination between adjacent blocks, thus resulting in the maintenance of the number of duplicates within the current bounds. although our data suggest that most of the f3'5'h copies are maintained across grape varieties, at least in a heterozygous state, the extent of structural variation among haplotypes remains to be determined.

regulatory diversification within the f3'5'h family and anthocyanin profiles
transcriptional subfunctionalisation has widely occurred within the f3'5'h family and is detectable even between some of the most recent duplicates that diverged less than 4dtv ~ <dig> . this is evident, for instance, among f3'5'hf, -j, and -l, which have retained >94% amino acid identity, and among f3'5'hf, -g, and -l, which show conservation at the cr <dig> and srs <dig> domains for 3'5'-oh activity. transcriptional subfunctionalisation is therefore one of the forces, if not the predominant one, that is responsible for the retention of the most recent duplicate f3'5'hs in grapevine. the extensive structural variation found in their 5' regulatory region, and the observed partitioned expression among organs and developmental stages might have promoted the diversification of duplicates shortly after their origination, and thus the preservation of both duplicates. these pieces of evidence fit well into the ddc model. deletion of regulatory modules is expected to occur by chance in promoters of duplicate genes, eliminating different cis-elements in either duplicate and diversifying their expression profiles  <cit> .

alternatively, a gene dosage model may also explain retention of duplicate f3'5'hs  <cit> , under the assumption that a fitness advantage is provided by extra f3'5'h copies. f3'5'h gene products compete with f3'h gene products for the enzymatic transformation of flavonoid substrates into delphinidin or cyanidin precursors. copy number variation is a common cause of altered stoichiometry of concerted enzyme activities within metabolic pathways, which results in phenotypic variation  <cit> . unbalanced phenotypes with increased levels of 3'5'-oh anthocyanins might have increased fitness, due to dissipation of high-energy blue wavelengths, attenuation of uv-b radiation, or conspicuousness of fruits to seed dispersers  <cit> .

regulatory modules alternatively maintained in the promoter of either f3'5'h duplicate contain binding sites for myb-type transcription factors, drought-inducible cis-elements, and motifs responsive to aba, methyl-jasmonate, light, and heat stress . the nature of these putative cis-elements correlates well with those factors shown to regulate f3'5'h expression. myb-type transcription factors are activators of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, including f3'5'hs  <cit> . light and water deficits promote f3'5'h expression in the grape berry  <cit> . aba and methyl-jasmonate are sucrose-dependent inducers of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes  <cit> . high temperatures restrict anthocyanin accumulation by promoting pigment degradation and transcriptional repression of anthocyanin genes  <cit> .

transcriptional regulation of duplicate f3'5'hs in berry skin is largely dependent on genotype, consistent with the observation in other plants that tandem duplicates have highly variable expression patterns  <cit> . in the present work, differential expression within the f3'5'h gene family between different cultivars was associated with the differential accumulation of 3'5'-oh anthocyanins. in the field, f3'5'h gene expression has a functional impact on anthocyanin biosynthesis that persists during fruit ripening. different copies of duplicate f3'5'hs have also become temporally specialised for different developmental stages of berry ripening . the question remains as to why these nuanced expression patterns have been maintained evolutionarily. one hypothesis is that copy-specific cis-elements confer unique, adaptive patterns of expression and environmental responsiveness by increasing the ratio of f3'5'h/f3'h enzyme concentration  under circumstances when accumulation of this class of metabolites is advantageous.

CONCLUSIONS
expansion in copy-number and transcriptional specialisation of f3'5'hs have increased the regulatory complexity of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit colour among red grape varieties. most duplications occurred rather recently within this gene family, long after the vitaceae lineage had separated from other dicot lineages. among duplicate copies, accumulation of structural variation in promoter regions was more significant than divergence in coding regions. transcriptional subfunctionalisation across organs and along developmental stages in ripening fruit was commonplace among gene copies, in addition to the extensive variation in gene expression among different cultivars. transcriptional differences within the f3'5'h gene family in different accessions were paralleled by significant changes in the major metabolites synthesised by the f3'5'h gene products. in berry skin, the abundance of different anthocyanins that modulate the pigmentation of red grapes and wines was greatly affected by these transcriptional variations.
