BACKGROUND
fusarium graminearum is an ascomycete that can cause diseases in a variety of agronomically important crops, including fusarium head blight  on wheat, barley and oat, and stalk rot on corn
 <cit> . infection by f. graminearum not only causes severe yield losses but also contaminates seeds with mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol  and nivalenol 
 <cit> , which are very harmful to humans and animals
 <cit> . the infection of crops by f. graminearum is still poorly understood, but genome and transcriptome research will enable us to identify genes that are required for pathogenicity and improve our understanding of infection mechanism of f. graminearum on its host plants. the genome of f. graminearum has been sequenced and currently two different annotations of the same genome assembly are available. one was generated by the broad institute
 <cit> , and a second one by mips
 <cit> .

the correctness of predicted gene models is extremely important for further comparative and functional genome studies. gene model predictions performed at the broad institute were mainly generated by machine annotation based on a combination of the calhoun annotation system and the fgenesh program
 <cit> . the mips f. graminearum database was constructed based on broad gene calls by integrating several sources and programs, including  integration of different gene prediction programs,  comparison of current f. graminearum gene models with related fusarium species  and other ascomycetes including neurospora crassa, and  inclusion of expression sequence tag  data
 <cit> . compared to the broad gene set,  <dig> gene models were revised and  <dig> new gene calls were added to mips gene set
 <cit> . although many gene models have been improved by these different approaches, most of them lack experimental support and for species-specific and non-conserved genes the gene model predictions are often incorrect or partially incorrect. in addition, it is difficult to identify novel genes and delineate untranslated regions  using traditional bioinformatics tools. to further improve gene model predictions, large-scale transcript information is required.

genome sequencing and annotation have provided a global view of the genes present in f. graminearum, but little is known about their transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. in homo sapiens, mus musculus, drosophila melanogaster and arabidopsis thaliana, alternative splicing has been reported to occur in many genes, which enables these organisms to enlarge their proteome diversity by increasing transcript variations in their genome
 <cit> . a striking example of alternative splicing is the dscam gene of d. melanogaster, which potentially generates more than  <dig>  different transcripts
 <cit> . in mammals, alternative splicing plays an important role in developmental processes, such as stem cell self-renewal and differentiation
 <cit> , development of heart and brain
 <cit> , and in the response to extracellular stimuli, such as immune cell activation and neuronal depolarization
 <cit> . in a. thaliana, alternative splicing has been shown to play an important role in its development
 <cit>  and in the response to environmental stimuli, such as light, cold and heat treatment
 <cit> . alternative splicing has also been reported in fungi, including cryptococcus neoformans, ustilago maydis, magnaporthe grisea, aspergillus nidulans, and f. verticillioides <cit> . however, so far, alternative splicing has not been reported to occur in f. graminearum.

recently, next-generation sequencing technology  has become available as a powerful tool to investigate the transcriptional profiles in many organisms, such as h. sapiens, saccharomyces cerevisiae, a. thaliana, candida albicans and c. parapsilosis <cit> . it has been demonstrated that rna-seq data can be efficiently used to improve gene model prediction and to identify novel transcripts
 <cit> . in addition, rna-seq technology is much more sensitive and efficient than previously used dedicated microarrays to compare gene expression profiles
 <cit> . rna-seq data also have been successfully used to identify alternative splicing in genes of different species
 <cit> . moreover, rna-seq technology has recently been used to identify rna editing in h. sapiens <cit> .

previously, we have identified and phenotypically characterized knock out mutant ebr <dig>  that shows reduced radial growth and reduced pathogenicity
 <cit> . ebr <dig> encodes a gal4-like zn2cys <dig> transcription factor that is localized in the nucleus during vegetative growth. in order to further unravel the regulatory role of ebr <dig> in radial growth, we have performed rna-seq on wild-type isolate ph- <dig>  and mutant ebr <dig>  to identify differentially expressed genes. in this study, we focused on the use of rna-seq data from both ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> to improve gene model predictions, identify novel genes, and search for alternative spicing and rna editing in f. graminearum. the obtained results were validated using rt-pcr and sequencing of the generated products. these analyses have improved numerous gene models and provided a comprehensive insight of rna splicing in f. graminearum.

RESULTS
quality analysis of the rna-seq data from f. graminearum
to perform rna-seq analysis, rna was isolated from mycelia of ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> grown in liquid cm medium for  <dig> h. the isolated rna was prepared to be sequenced by next generation sequencing technology . of each isolate, two technical replicates were analyzed. in total  <dig> , <dig> reads  from ph- <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from ebr <dig> were obtained. using the genome annotation in the broad database, transcripts were detected for  <dig> % of the  <dig> predicted genes in ph- <dig> and for  <dig> % of the genes in ebr <dig> . by combing the rna-seq data from both ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> we detected the expression of over 84% of the predicted genes. in addition, the combined rna-seq data showed that  <dig> % of the reads matched to exonic regions,  <dig> % to untranslated regions ,  <dig> % to intergenic regions and only  <dig> % to intronic regions . among all matched reads, 84% matched to unique locations, and 16% to multiple locations in the genome, of which 2% matched to between  <dig> to  <dig> different locations, and 14% to more than  <dig> different locations . of all reads that matched to multiple locations,  <dig> % matched to intergenic regions,  <dig> % to utrs, and only  <dig> % to coding regions .

to evaluate the quality of rna-seq data, several quality control analyses were performed. firstly, the total coverage of reads from the 5′ to the 3′ end of genes was examined. for both ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> rna-seq reads were evenly distributed the exception of the very 5′ and 3′ ends . in addition, for 54% of the genes in ph- <dig> and 60% of the genes in ebr <dig> the read coverage was more than 90% . finally, comparison of the two technical replicates of both ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> clearly showed that the rna-seq data are highly reproducible .

matching of the reads to the f. graminearum gene database showed that the  <dig> % of the matched reads supported the gene models present in the broad f. graminearum database, implying that reads matched to exonic, but not to intronic regions of genes. for example, all  <dig> reads from ph- <dig> and all  <dig> reads from ebr <dig> uniquely matched to the exonic regions of gene fgsg_ <dig>  and no reads were found matching to the intronic regions . comparing the reads matching to gene fgsg_ <dig> from ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> showed that the distribution pattern of reads along the gene was very similar . similar distribution patterns of reads in ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> were also found in other genes. to evaluate the background of non-specific transcripts, we compared the expression of ebr <dig> in ph- <dig> and ebr <dig>  in ph- <dig>   <dig> reads were found that matched to the coding region of ebr <dig>  whereas no reads were found matching to ebr <dig> in ebr <dig> . altogether these results clearly show that the obtained rna-seq data are of high quality and form a firm basis for further analysis.

strategies to identify incorrect gene models and alternative splicing
we combined the rna-seq data of ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> and employed three different strategies to identify incorrect gene models and alternative splicing in f. graminearum . the first strategy was to identify reads that matched to intronic regions. reads matching intronic regions originate from either incorrectly annotated or alternatively spliced genes. the second strategy was aimed at predicting transcripts with non-matched or mismatched regions. of highly expressed genes, the transcripts should be well covered by reads. however, of some transcripts regions not matched by reads or not perfectly matched by reads were identified which points to novel introns or incorrectly predicted introns in these genes. two examples of this type of transcripts are shown in additional file
3: figure s <dig>  in total,  <dig> possibly incorrectly annotated or alternatively spliced genes were identified by the first strategy and  <dig> by the second. to further refine incorrect gene models and identify genes with alternative splicing, the tophat program was applied. this program identifies intron splice sites and has been widely applied to identify incorrect gene annotations and alternative splicing
 <cit> . by applying this program, we obtained  <dig> putatively new genes. comparing all these three strategies, we identified  <dig> genes that were exclusively identified by the first strategy,  <dig> genes by the second, and  <dig> genes by the tophat program. only  <dig> genes were identified by all three strategies .

using these three strategies,  <dig> genes with possibly incorrect gene models or alternative splicing were identified when compared with the broad f. graminearum annotation. we further examined these genes in the mips f. graminearum database and found that  <dig> of the identified genes had already been revised . subsequently, we manually examined the remaining  <dig> genes in the clc software package and classified them into two distinct groups: incorrect gene models and alternatively spliced genes. to distinguish between these two options, we carefully examined reads for the presence of splice sites. genes that matched reads showing both reference splice site and additional splice site were considered to be the result of alternative splicing; genes that matched reads only showing additional splice site but not reference splice site were grouped into incorrect gene models.

identification of incorrect gene models
 <dig> genes that were incorrectly annotated in the broad f. graminearum database and had not yet been revised in the mips f. graminearum database were further analyzed. they were divided into four classes:  gene models with incorrectly predicted introns,  gene models with incorrect intron splice sites,  gene models with novel introns and  gene models with other incorrect annotations . in total  <dig> genes with incorrect intron predictions were identified . for example, according to the annotation in the broad f. graminearum database, there are two introns in gene fgsg_ <dig>  however, several rna-seq reads that matched to the second intron indicated that the proposed second intron does not exist . for confirmation of this result, primers flanking the supposed second intron were designed and rt-pcr was performed. genomic dna isolated from ph- <dig> and two cdnas isolated from ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> were used as templates, respectively. rt-pcr confirmed that the proposed second intron in this gene is absent . open reading frame inspection showed that the newly proposed gene model is translated into a functional protein without a premature stop. furthermore, two additional randomly chosen genes, fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig>  were inspected using the same strategy as described for fgsg_ <dig>  and both lacked the predicted introns in the amplified fragments. in contrast, gene fgsg_ <dig> that was selected as positive control confirmed the predicted intron .

in addition to incorrect intron predictions, we identified novel introns in  <dig> genes . additional file
3: figure s4a shows an example of a novel intron identified in gene fgsg_ <dig>  to validate the presence of novel introns, flanking primers for five randomly selected introns were designed and for all of them the presence of the introns was confirmed by rt-pcr .

in  <dig> genes incorrectly predicted splice sites were identified, including incorrect donor and acceptor sites or both; they were manually revised according to our rna-seq data . additional file
3: figure s5a shows an example of an incorrectly predicted splice site. three genes with incorrectly predicted splice sites were randomly selected and were all confirmed by rt-pcr . in addition,  <dig> genes were identified with incorrect gene models of which the correct splice sites could not be assigned yet due to low read coverage or other reasons. comparison of these genes models with our rna-seq data are shown in additional file
3: figure s <dig> 

gene expression analysis showed that for 15% of the predicted genes transcripts were absent in the rna-seq data. to determine whether these genes result from incorrect gene calls in databases or were not expressed under the condition tested, we performed a homology search of the predicted proteins using blastp against the ncbi database. as orthologous genes could be identified for  <dig> % of these genes , we conclude that these genes are correctly annotated but not or very lowly expressed in liquid cm medium.

identification of alternatively spliced genes in f. graminearum
from our rna-seq data,  <dig> genes were identified with alternative splicing, including exon skipping, intron retention, or alternative 5′ and 3′ splice sites . most of the alternatively spliced genes involved intron retentions  of which one example is shown in figure
4b. in gene fgsg_ <dig>  there are four reads that confirm reference intron splice sites, whereas several reads uniquely matched to a presumed intronic region. to confirm retention of these introns, rt-pcr was performed for three randomly selected genes, and in all cases the predicted intron retentions were confirmed . open reading frame analysis of genes with intron retention showed that most of them lead to premature termination of translation .

in addition to intron retention, we identified  <dig> genes with alternative 5′ or 3′ splice sites or both . similar to genes with intron retention, most genes with alternative 5′ and 3′ splice sites led to premature termination of translation. among all these alternatively spliced introns, we identified three introns with two alternative 3′ splice sites and three with two or three alternative 5′ splice sites. for instance, gene fgsg_ <dig> that encodes a hmg-box protein with a coiled coil and hmg domain contains two alternative 3′ splice sites according to rna-seq data . the alternative 3′ splice sites were confirmed by rt-pcr . compared to the predicted transcript based on the gene model present in the broad database, the two alternative 3′ splice sites do not lead to premature termination of the transcript. however, the two alternative transcripts lead to proteins lacking  <dig> amino and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, that are located between the coiled coil and hmg domain . another example is gene fgsg_ <dig> for which there are four different 5′ splice sites in its second intron  that were all confirmed by rt-pcr . all alternative transcripts are not prematurely terminated . fgsg_ <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein, with a putative transmembrane and prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase domain. both domains are present in all four predicted proteins.

finally, we identified four cases of exon skipping . fgsg_ <dig> is an example of a gene with alternative exon skipping  that encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase srk <dig> with an s_tkc domain between amino acid  residues  <dig> and  <dig> . the third exon in fgsg_ <dig> is sometimes lacking in transcripts as was confirmed by rt-pcr , leading to the loss of  <dig> aa residues in the s_tkc domain.

from above, six genes with alternative splicing were confirmed in both ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> by rt-pcr. we further analyzed all remaining alternatively spliced genes by using rna-seq data from ph- <dig> and ebr <dig>  respectively, in the clc software package. nearly all of the alternative splicing events can be identified in both ph- <dig> and ebr <dig>  this indicates that disruption of ebr <dig> in f. graminearum does not affect alternative splicing. to further understand possible roles of all alternatively spliced genes, we functionally categorized them by using the mips funcatdb database. the alternatively spliced genes did not belong to one specific functional class of genes, but were classified in many different categories, of which “proteins with binding function or cofactor requirement”  and “protein synthesis”  prevailed.

alternative splicing is developmentally regulated
to test whether alternative splicing in f. graminearum is developmentally regulated, we performed rt-pcr on four alternatively spliced genes  on ph- <dig> rna samples isolated at five different time points  . in this medium, the macroconidia of f. graminearum swell within  <dig> h, germinate after  <dig> h and the hyphae elongate and develop into mycelium after  <dig> h
 <cit> . for gene fgsg_ <dig> , the expression ratio between the two transcript isoforms is independent of the growth stage, whereas this ratio  increased for gene fgsg_ <dig>  after  <dig> h. the expression of genes fgsg_ <dig>  and fgsg_ <dig>  show strong developmental regulation and the expression ratio between the two transcript isoforms changes strongly at different vegetative growth stages. the rt-pcrs for these genes were biologically repeated with similar result. these data suggest that for some of the alternatively spliced genes the expression levels and the ratio between transcripts change during vegetative growth.

non-canonical splice sites
manually inspection of the  <dig> genes with putative incorrect gene models or alternative splicing resulted in the identification of  <dig> genes with non-canonical splice sites . in total the  <dig> genes contain  <dig> introns, of which  <dig> % carry canonical gt-ag donor-acceptor sites,  <dig> % introns carry gc-ag donor-acceptor sites, and the remaining  <dig> % carry other non-canonical donor-acceptor sites, including gt-gg, ac-ac, gg-ta, ta-ag, at-ac and ga-ag. seven genes with non-canonical splice sites are shown in figure
7a and the correctness of all these splice sites was confirmed by sanger sequencing showing that they were not caused by sequencing errors.
 <cit> . y-axis indicates sequence conservation at each position. the height of symbols in each position represents the relative frequency of each nucleic acid. arrows indicate splice sites.

the  <dig> introns with gc-ag splice sites were analyzed for the presence of conserved flanking nucleotides by using motif comparison tool
 <cit> . ag nucleotides predominantly flank the gc donor site, whereas in the intronic region, aagt occurs more frequently. the nucleotides flanking the ag acceptor site are less conserved. however, a c or t prevails in the intronic region flanking ag .

identification of novel transcriptionally active and untranslated regions
by mapping rna-seq reads against the broad f. graminearum database,  <dig> % of the reads matched to intergenic regions, from which  <dig> novel transcriptionally active regions  were obtained . to determine whether these ntars encode proteins, they were blasted against the mips f. graminearum and broad fusarium databases. of these  <dig> ntars,  <dig> had already been predicted as novel genes in the mips f. graminearum database,  <dig> of which show orthologs in either the f. oxysporum, f. verticillioides or both. in addition, we identified  <dig> ntars that had not yet been annotated in the mips f. graminearum database but are putatively derived from genes as orthologs were identified in either f. oxysporum, f. verticillioides or both. in addition, we found  <dig> ntars  that contain introns, indicating that they could be real genes . additional file
3: figure s9a shows an example of an ntar, tu <dig>  which contains three introns. to confirm that the identified ntars are real, five were selected and confirmed by rt-pcr .

the rna-seq data also allowed identification of the boundaries of 5′ and 3′ utrs of genes. for  <dig> genes 5′ utrs and for  <dig> genes 3′ utrs were identified . comparing utrs identified by rna-seq analysis with those present in the annotated genome in the broad f. graminearum database showed some genes with incorrectly predicted utrs. one example is shown in additional file
3: figure s10b where the 3′ utr prediction in gene fgsg_ <dig> is different from that predicted by rna-seq analysis.

screening for rna editing in f. graminearum
in total  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified when comparing rna-seq data with the genome sequences by using the clc software package. all snps were manually examined and a large number was identified in stretches of multiple cytosine residues. in addition, many snps were identified near intron splice sites and appeared to be caused by misalignment of cdna to the genomic dna sequence. twelve representative snps were selected for confirmation by sanger sequencing of the pcr amplicons obtained from both genomic dna and cdna. in four cases the snps were not real and due to sequencing errors present in the genomic dna sequence of ph- <dig>  for the remaining eight snps, no differences were observed between cdna and genomic sequences after re-sequencing suggesting that in the latter cases discrepancies between the rna-seq data and the genome sequence could be explained by sequencing errors in the initial rna-seq data set. these results suggest that no rna editing occurs in f. graminearum according to our analysis.

discussion
in this study we analyzed the transcriptome of f. graminearum grown in liquid cm medium by illumina sequencing to investigate the correctness of predicted gene models present in the annotated broad f. graminearum genome database and to identify the occurrence of alternative splicing, rna editing, non-canonical splice sites, novel transcripts and the sequences of the 5′ utr and 3′ utr regions. the total coverage of reads along the genes was evenly distributed except for the ultimate 5′ and 3′ ends indicating that overall our rna-seq data are of high quality
 <cit> . although overall the read coverage was evenly distributed over genes, for individual genes the coverage was not evenly distributed; this phenomenon has also been reported in other rna-seq studies
 <cit> . interestingly, for nearly all genes the read coverage pattern between wt ph- <dig> and mutant ebr <dig> is very similar. this suggests that each gene has a characteristic rna-seq profile, which could be related to secondary structure of particular domains of rna molecules that interfere with rna shearing and subsequent sequencing.

the background reads in rna-seq data sets have been reported to be low. for example in rna-seq data obtained from yeast, no reads matching a  <dig> -kb deleted region were obtained, and very few reads matching to nontranscribed centromeres were identified
 <cit> . a similar result was found in our rna-seq analysis; a comparison of the ebr <dig> expression level between ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> showed no transcription of the ebr <dig> gene in the ebr <dig> deletion mutant. in addition, we found that rna-seq data analysis for both ph- <dig> and ebr <dig> rna-seq is very reproducible.

analysis of the read distribution suggests that  <dig> % of reads matched to intergenic regions, which is relatively high in comparison to 3% and 5% found in h. sapiens and a. thaliana, respectively
 <cit> . this high percentage may at least partly reflect the lower quality of gene model prediction in f. graminearum compared to h. sapiens and a. thaliana. in the latter two genomes, several rounds of gene annotation have been performed and more experimental evidence has been provided to support the gene models. in addition, 16% of the reads could not be matched to a single location in the genome, a finding that was also reported in other species
 <cit> . for instance, in h. sapiens, 20% of the intergenic reads match to multiple locations in the genome, of which 6% match to 2– <dig> locations and 14% to more than  <dig> locations
 <cit> . furthermore, we identified that most of the reads mapping to multiple locations originate from intergenic regions and utrs, whereas only very few reads matched to coding regions, which suggests that the reads matching to each transcript are very specific and the read coverage of each transcript is a reliable reflection of the gene expression level.

rna-seq has been widely used to identify incorrect gene models and alternative splicing in different organisms
 <cit> . however, to distinguish incorrect gene models from alternative splicing is a challenging and laborious task. in this study, all selected genes were manually examined in the clc software package to identify reads showing splice sites. rt-pcr analysis on the selected genes confirmed that identification of incorrectly annotated gene models and alternative splicing appears reliable. in total  <dig> genes were identified with incorrect gene models in the broad f. graminearum database. excluding genes with no detectable expression or with low read coverage , the fraction of incorrect gene models in the published annotation of the broad f. graminearum database is  <dig> %. gene model predictions in the mips f. graminearum database were considered to be of higher quality than those in the broad f. graminearum database
 <cit> , which was confirmed by our rna-seq analysis. nonetheless we could still improve many gene models predicted in the mips f. graminearum database. even some of the manually revised gene models in the mips f. graminearum database appeared to be incorrect, indicating that gene annotations in the f. graminearum database still need to be improved and that rna-seq analysis can significantly improve the published gene models. in this study, rna-seq data were generated from mycelia growing in nutrient-rich medium. to investigate whether the incorrectly annotated genes are caused by alternative splicing, we also analyzed the available est data generated from other conditions, such as carbon- and nitrogen- starved media and cultures of maturing perithecia
 <cit> . these est data support our discoveries that genes are incorrectly annotated, but six genes were identified that have two different transcripts, indicating that they might be alternatively spliced. consequently, some of the genes classified in this study as incorrectly annotated genes might in fact be alternative spliced genes.

alternative splicing has been investigated in many organisms including h. sapiens, caenorhabditis elegans, a. thaliana and c. neoformans <cit> . in h. sapiens, 95% of the genes undergo alternative splicing
 <cit> ; in a. thaliana, alternative splicing is estimated to be 42%
 <cit> . in fungi much lower percentages of alternative splicing have been predicted, including  <dig> %  in c. neoformans,  <dig> %  in a. flavus and  <dig> %  in m. grisea <cit> . we found alternative splicing in  <dig> genes  in f. graminearum, but it should be noted that we have only analyzed expression in one growth condition and as fungi can adapt to many different environmental conditions we expect that this percentage will increase when transcription profiles under more different growth conditions are analyzed. at least  <dig> different types of alternative splicing exist in f. graminearum, of which intron retention appeared most prevalent, which is also the case in a. thaliana <cit> , whereas in h. sapiens, exon skipping is most prevalent
 <cit> .

in-frame analysis showed that the majority of the alternatively spliced transcripts identified in f. graminearum cause premature termination codons , of which most are located in intronic regions. also in h. sapiens and a. thaliana, a high percentage of alternatively spliced transcripts contain ptcs
 <cit> . in a. thaliana,  <dig> % of the alternatively spliced genes introduce ptcs and most of them are considered as potential targets of the nonsense mediated mrna decay 
 <cit> . nmd was initially identified in s. cerevisiae and later widely studied in higher eukaryotes
 <cit> , but so far, only a few studies on nmd are reported in filamentous fungi
 <cit>  and whether the ptcs identified in f. graminearum are also associated with nmd needs to be further investigated. apart from ptc isoforms, some alternatively spliced transcripts encoding proteins with diverse length were identified. the effects of the diversity in length on the biological function of proteins are still unknown, but several functions including binding properties, intracellular localization, enzymatic activity or stability might be affected
 <cit> .

alternative splicing appears widespread in eukaryotes, but the biological function of alternative splicing is still poorly understood. some studies have shown that alternative splicing events are developmentally regulated or associated with the response to different environmental conditions
 <cit> . for instance, in a. thaliana, the circadian clock associated  <dig>  gene produces two different transcripts and their expression ratio is dependent of light and temperature
 <cit> . similarly, in a. thaliana splicing of serine/arginine-rich protein-encoding genes is altered in response to hormones or abiotic stresses
 <cit> . in h. sapiens, a number of genes involved in apoptosis
 <cit>  and differentiation of embryonic stem cells are regulated by alternative splicing
 <cit> . in our study, we have also demonstrated that for some genes the alternative splicing events are regulated at different vegetative growth stages in f. graminearum; their biological implications are not yet understood, but they might be important in adaptation of f. graminearum to changing external environmental conditions that occur during different growth stages.

as reported previously in other species, in addition to the canonical gt donor and ag acceptor sites in introns there are several non-canonical donor and acceptor sites, of which gc occurs most frequently as an alternative donor site
 <cit> . the non-canonical splice sites in f. graminearum also showed that the gc donor, ag acceptor combination is prevalent, of which the proportion is consistent with what has been found in other organisms
 <cit> . in addition, the nucleotide preferences flanking the gc donor splice site and ag acceptor splice site identified in f. graminearum are consistent with previous reports in other organisms
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have analyzed the transcriptome of f. graminearum during growth in nutrient-rich medium by rna-seq and identified transcripts of 84% of the predicted genes, which allowed us to not only significantly revise existing gene models present in the broad fusarium database but also to get preliminary information on the presence of alternative splicing in this fungus. this is one of the most comprehensive reports on alternative splicing in filamentous fungi. our analyses indicate that the occurrence of alternative splicing in f. graminearum is lower than in h. sapiens and a. thaliana. nevertheless, the expression of alternatively spliced genes appeared tightly regulated in different growth stage and can change from spore to mycelium within a few hours. this is the first indication that alternative splicing may be important in the developmental regulation in filamentous fungi. in the future, the biological functions of the different transcript isoforms and their encoded proteins need to be studied in more detail.
