BACKGROUND
cohesinopathies are a group of developmental disorders, including roberts syndrome  and cornelia de lange syndrome , caused by loss of function mutations in the cohesin complex or its regulators. the cohesin complex is a structural component of chromosomes and helps to facilitate many different chromosomal processes such as genome organization, chromosome segregation, double-strand break repair, and gene expression. the developmental defects associated with the cohesinopathies include slow growth and small size, hirsutism, mental retardation, craniofacial anomalies, limb malformations, and heart, gastrointestinal, and auditory problems. while the molecular etiology of these developmental disorders is unclear, one working model is that the loss of cohesin function results in changes in gene expression during embryogenesis . these changes in gene expression could occur via several mechanisms including altered gene looping or genome architecture .

rbs is an autosomal recessive, multi-system developmental syndrome caused by loss of function mutation in a gene that encodes a cohesin acetyltransferase, esco <dig>  <cit> . a hallmark of chromosomes from rbs cells is heterochromatic repulsion, observed in metaphase spreads, possibly indicating a lack of cohesion at these regions  <cit> . two genes, esco <dig> and esco <dig>  both encode acetyltransferases that acetylate the smc <dig> subunit of cohesin during dna replication to lock the cohesin ring onto dna. a mutation in yeast eco <dig>  which is a yeast homolog of human esco1/ <dig>  was recently shown to disrupt cohesion, replication, transcription, and looping at the ribosomal dna  repeats  <cit> . mutations that disrupt the acetyltransferase activity of eco1/esco <dig> also disrupt nucleolar architecture, impair ribosomal rna  production and ribosome biogenesis, and reduce protein biosynthesis in budding yeast and human rbs cells . cohesin binds to the rdna in every organism studied  <cit> , giving cohesin the potential to affect the structure and function of the nucleolus which is essential for both ribosome biogenesis and organization of the genome.

we recently reported that mtor  signaling was strongly downregulated in human rbs patient cells, accompanied by p <dig> activation  <cit> . amino acids, and in particular l-leucine , have been shown to stimulate mtorc <dig>  in zebrafish models for rbs and cdls, l-leu boosted cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and development  <cit> . the dramatic rescue effect of l-leu at the cellular and organismal level suggests that cohesinopathies are caused in part by translational defects  <cit> . since the mtor pathway is a critical regulator of protein translation and ribosome function, and p <dig> is an indicator of nucleolar stress, translational impairment may contribute to differential gene expression in rbs. therefore, we have used rbs as a disease model to address mtor-associated transcription and translation dysfunction. a number of reports have shown that mtor kinase signaling controls mrna translation by two branches. the first is through phosphorylation of 4ebp <dig>   <cit> . the unphosphorylated form of 4ebp <dig> is a translational repressor that directly binds to eif4e , a limiting component for translation initiation for 40s. phosphorylation of 4ebp <dig> releases eif4e for translation initiation. mtor also controls translation via phosphorylation of rps <dig> by rps <dig> kinase  which activates ribosomal protein s <dig> to promote its 40s ribosome function. the depression of mtor observed in rbs cells affects both branches of the pathway which converge on 40s function.

in addition to its role in promoting nucleolar function, cohesin plays a role throughout the genome in forming chromatin loops that can affect gene expression. for instance, cohesin promotes the formation of loops at the imprinted loci igf2-h <dig>  <cit> , myc  <cit> , and pluripotency factors  <cit> . the misregulation of any of these master regulators can have grave consequences for cell-type specification and cellular function. the cohesin-dependent control of chromosome organization is another mechanism, in addition to changes in mtor signaling, that is predicted to underpin the gene expression changes associated with the cohesinopathies.

the rescue provided by l-leu in animal and tissue culture models for the cohesinopathies strongly suggested that many of the critical transcriptional changes were ameliorated by boosting translation. to address l-leu dependent transcription and translation at a gene-by-gene level, we examined translation initiation complexes and performed ribosome profiling in rbs cells. we found that l-leu partially rescued translation initiation, translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits and translation factors, and mitochondrial function in rbs cells. however, other differentially expressed genes do not respond to l-leu, suggesting they are misexpressed independent of the tor pathway. these include the imprinted genes and hox genes which are known to be regulated by cohesin-dependent looping events. this is consistent with our previous observation that l-leu stimulates mtorc <dig> without rescuing the architectural defects in the nucleolus observed in rbs cells. our results suggest targeting mtorc <dig> with l-leu rescues a significant fraction of the differential gene expression associated with rbs. l-leu could be a promising therapeutic strategy for human diseases associated with poor translation.

RESULTS
40s and 60s ribosome subunits are present at lower levels in rbs cells
our previous studies demonstrated ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis were defective in rbs cells. for our analysis, we used normal human fibroblasts, rbs fibroblasts , and rbs fibroblasts in which a wild-type copy of the esco <dig> gene has been added back   <cit> . we also used two other rbs cell lines , which were  untransformed amniotic fluid-derived, and  a fetal skin fibroblast cell line. for untransformed primary fibroblasts, the donor subject was homozygous for a 5 bp deletion at nucleotide  <dig> in exon  <dig> of the esco <dig> gene  resulting in a frameshift that leads to a truncated protein . for untransformed amniocytes, the donor subject was a compound heterozygote. one allele has a 1 bp deletion at nucleotide  <dig> in exon  <dig> of the esco <dig> gene , and the second allele has an a > g substitution in intron  <dig> . both the immortalized rbs fibroblasts and the two untransformed rbs cell lines had similar depression of the mtorc <dig> signaling pathway, an aberrant cell cycle pattern, and reduced protein translation. moreover, l-leu treatment partially rescued cell proliferation and survival, ribosome biogenesis, and protein biosynthesis similarly in all three rbs lines  <cit> . we selected the transformed rbs fibroblasts for use in our current study because the corrected version provides an excellent control.

we decided to examine expression of individual ribosomal proteins in the wt, rbs mutant, and corrected cell lines. western blotting analysis revealed lower levels of both 40s small subunit and 60s large subunit ribosome proteins including rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig> in the mutant relative to wt and corrected cells . since l-leu is able to improve protein biosynthesis in rbs cells, we examined the effect of l-leu on ribosomal proteins. since d-leucine  is not used as an amino acid, we used d-leu treatment as a negative control. the levels of both rps <dig> and rpl <dig> were partially rescued by l-leu supplement but not the bioinactive d-leu . in addition, eif2α phosphorylation was elevated in rbs cells, suggesting a state of translational repression similar to nutrition starvation. interestingly, we found the phospho-eif2α level in rbs cells declined with l-leu supplementation. the data suggested that defective ribosome biogenesis in rbs includes lower levels of ribosomal proteins that can be rescued with l-leu. furthermore, the eif2α phosphorylation suggests the possibility of an integrated stress response  <cit>  that includes defective translation initiation that can be relieved with l-leu.fig.  <dig> ribosomal components and translation initiation complexes were present at low levels in rbs cells. a western blotting showed that 40s small ribosome proteins rps <dig> and rps <dig>  and 60s large ribosome proteins rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig> were decreased in esco <dig> mutant  compared to wt fibroblasts  or corrected fibroblasts . b l-leu supplement, but not d-leu, partially rescued rps <dig> and rpl <dig> protein levels, and reversed the elevation of eif2α phosphorylation in rbs cells. α-tubulin and eif2α serve as loading controls. c m7-gtp coupled beads were used to pull down translation initiation complexes from whole cell lysates. 4ebp <dig> protein was strongly enriched in rbs cells, accompanied by less binding of eif4g <dig>  but this trend was partially reversed in rbs cells treated with l-leu. eif4e levels were not affected. d antibodies to eif4e were used to pull down translation initiation complexes. 4ebp <dig> was present at high levels in rbs cells, correlating with less eif4g <dig> and the inhibition of translation initiation. l-leu supplement promoted the assembly of the translation competent eif4e complex. e antibodies to eif3b were used to pull down translation initiation complexes. eif4e and eif4g <dig> were present at lower levels in rbs cells, but this trend was partially reversed by l-leu supplement



low levels of translation initiation complexes in rbs cells are partially rescued by l-leu
to further investigate translation initiation, we used pull downs to examine the formation of translation initiation complexes. 4ebp <dig> is a protein that prevents translation initiation when its unphosphorylated form interacts with eif4e. since l-leu improved 4ebp <dig> phosphorylation in rbs cells , we further examined the 5’cap mrna translation initiation complex using an m7gtp binding assay. m7gtp beads pull down more 4ebp <dig> protein in rbs cells compared to corrected cells . 4ebp <dig> binding to eif4e inhibits the eif4e-eif4g interaction, blocking translation initiation. consistently, eif4g protein displayed less binding to m7gtp in rbs cells. the addition of l-leu partially reduced 4ebp <dig> levels in m7gtp fraction, and restored eif4g binding for rbs cells.

to further evaluate translation initiation complexes, we immunoprecipitated eif4e and examined interacting proteins . we observed an enrichment of 4ebp <dig> in the eif4e pull down in rbs cell lysates, and a marked reduction in eif4g <dig>  l-leu treatment rescued eif4g1- eif4e association, and released the 4ebp <dig> inhibitory interaction. finally, we pulled down eif3b to assess eif3b-eif4e-eif4g assembly of the 43s pre-initiation complex. the eif4g <dig> and eif4e proteins were present at lower levels in immunoprecipitations from rbs cells , but their levels were efficiently rescued by the addition of l-leu. we also found that l-leu partly rescued low levels of phospho-s6k <dig> in rbs fibroblasts . collectively, the results clearly indicated that rbs fibroblasts have fewer translation initiation competent complexes. their formation could be partially rescued by l-leu supplement.

l-leu relieved translational efficiency for several gene classes in rbs
to systematically determine the translational efficiency of each mrna in rbs fibroblasts, we used ribosome profiling and rna deep sequencing. wild-type, mutant, and corrected fibroblasts were treated with d-leu  or l-leu. ribosome profiling monitors translational efficiency by measuring ribosome-protected mrna fragments  relative to the number of mrnas  <cit> . we collected cells treated for 3 h to assess mrnas with immediate translational changes in response to l-leu. we also collected cells treated for 24 h to examine the long term effects of l-leu on rbs cells. we detected exon-mapped ribosome footprints that corresponded to actively translated refseq mrnas. numbers of total reads per sample ranged from  <dig> e +  <dig> to  <dig> e +  <dig>  the number of ribosome footprints that map to each mrna divided by the number of total mrna reads  reflects the proportion of ribosomes engaged in the translation of that transcript. in our ribosome profiling and rna seq analysis, the patterns between wild-type and esco2-corrected cells were similar, although not identical, at the transcriptional and translational levels . the differences between the wt cells and the corrected cells could be due to the differences in genetic background as well as slight overexpression of esco <dig> in the corrected cells  <cit> . given that the esco2-corrected cells mostly resembled wt cells, we decided to focus our analysis on the comparison of the mutant and corrected cells since they have the identical genetic backgrounds.

two recent studies have examined translational efficiency in the presence of mtor chemical inhibitors  <cit> . the translation of genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine  motifs, which includes many ribosomal protein genes and a number of translation initiation and elongation factors, is particularly inefficient in the presence of these compounds  <cit> . strikingly, almost all 5’ top genes showed poor translational efficiency in rbs cells . this efficiency was partially rescued with l-leu at both  <dig> and 24 h treatment, consistent with our western blotting results for individual ribosomal protein subunits. furthermore, the 5’ top genes were likely de novo translational targets of mtorc <dig> stimulation because they responded strongly at 3 h l-leu treatment.fig.  <dig> l-leu increased translation of genes with poor translational efficiency in rbs cells. the corrected  and rbs mutant  cells were treated with either d-leu or l-leu for 3 h or 24 h. cells were collected for ribosome profiling. a the boxplot shows the translational efficiency for genes with a 5’ top sequence. these mrnas showed poor translational efficiency in rbs cells, which was partly rescued by l-leu treatment. corrected cells with d-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> e-22; mutant cells with l-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> e-14; corrected cells with d-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e-16; mutant cells with l-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e- <dig>  b the boxplot shows the translational efficiency for genes with a prte sequence. these mrnas showed poor translational efficiency in rbs cells that was partially improved by l-leu. corrected cells with d-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> e-14; mutant cells with l-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> e-9; corrected cells with d-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e-14; mutant cells with l-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e- <dig>  c the boxplot shows the translational efficiency for genes previously defined to be hypersensitive to mtor inhibition via babel analysis  <cit> . these mrnas showed poor translational efficiency in rbs cells that was partially improved by l-leu. corrected cells with d-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> ; mutant cells with l-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> ; corrected cells with d-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e-8; mutant cells with l-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e-6



hsieh et al. reported a second group of genes with a pyrimidine-rich translational element  that were hyperdependent on mtor-controlled translation  <cit> . similar to the 5'terminal oligopyrimidine  genes, almost 90 % of these genes were poorly translated in rbs cells, but their translational efficiency improved dramatically with both  <dig> and 24 h of l-leu supplementation . these genes function in various cellular processes such as glycogen storage , cytokinesis , mrna metabolism , nuclear import , protein transport , osteogenesis , nucleosome assembly , and heat shock . moreover, the prte genes, like the 5’top genes, were likely de novo translational targets of mtorc <dig> signaling because they responded strongly to 3 h treatment.

previous analysis by another group using a bioinformatics approach known as babel analysis identified genes with significantly reduced translation associated with impeded mtor activity  <cit> . in addition to the prte and 5’top genes, this group of genes includes subunits of the eif <dig> complex, and multiple rab family ras-related gtpases involved in endocytic trafficking. more than 60 % of these genes showed poor translational efficiency in rbs cells that was partially rescued with both  <dig> and 24 h l-leu treatment . the mrna levels of the 5’top, prte, and babel gene groups were not significantly affected in mutant versus corrected cells, nor were they affected by l-leucine treatment , strongly arguing for a translation-based rescue.

these results demonstrate that the gene groups that show exceptionally poor translation in response to pharmacological inhibition of mtorc <dig> also show poor translational activity in rbs cells. furthermore, the translation of these same gene groups was partly improved by l-leu treatment. for these gene groups, the effects of  <dig> and 24 h treatments were similar, suggesting that these gene groups contain many direct targets of the mtorc <dig> pathway. taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusion that l-leu activates mtorc <dig> function in rbs fibroblasts.

in addition to using predefined gene lists, we identified all genes whose translational efficiency was increased with l-leu treatment in rbs cells. we used different methods to identify genes with improved translation efficiency: 1) babel analysis, 2) fold change in translational efficiency greater than two and a minimum of  <dig> reads. for both methods, the gene ontology  term analysis was very similar and included enrichment for ribosome components, translation initiation and elongation factors, protein targeting/sorting genes , and rna metabolism genes . we found that l-leu improved the translational efficiency of more genes at the long timepoint . these results suggest that improved translational efficiency of direct mtorc <dig> targets at the short timepoint improved the translational efficiency of more genes following longer term treatment.

we used meme to discover new motifs associated with genes with  <dig> fold or greater improved translational efficiency at 3 h  <cit> . motif analysis identified 5’top and prte sequences, as expected, but also identified a new motif “ccaggctggtct” . this motif does not correspond to any known transcription factor binding site. go term analysis for genes with the new motif included translational elongation and translational termination, but also more surprisingly, protein localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, and mrna catabolic processes . mrnas with the motif may represent newly discovered targets of mtorc <dig> dependent translation .

loss of mtorc <dig> function has been shown to inhibit translation of many cell cycle proteins, including cohesin and condensin subunits such as smc <dig>  stag <dig>  nipbl, smc <dig> and smc <dig>  <cit> . we wondered whether l-leu stimulation would affect transcription or translation of these mtorc <dig> targets. while the transcription and translation of many of these genes is altered in the mutant as compared to corrected cells, they did not show a coherent response to l-leu , helping to confirm that l-leu specifically boosted mtorc1-dependent translation.

poor mitochondrial function in rbs is partially improved by l-leu
it has been reported that mtorc <dig> inhibition reduces mitochondrial biogenesis and activity via a 4ebp <dig> dependent mechanism  <cit> . we examined the behavior of  <dig> human genes annotated with cellular component “mitochondrial part.” we found that most of these genes are differentially expressed in the rbs cells compared to corrected cells , and remain differentially expressed upon l-leu treatment. however, about ~30 % of these genes are leucine responsive at both timepoints . the go terms associated with the leucine responsive cluster are atp synthesis , cytochrome c oxidase activity and nadh dehydrogenase activity , and respiratory chain complex i  .fig.  <dig> l-leu treatment partially rescued mitochondrial function in rbs cells. a the heatmap shows that genes with mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in rbs cells. the yellow and purple bars indicate gene groups that are downregulated or upregulated, respectively, in the mutant cells, and are unresponsive to leucine. the subgroup that is affected by l-leucine treatment in the rbs cells is indicated by the green bar. see additional file 2: table s <dig> for go terms for the leucine responsive cluster. b intracellular atp concentration was low in rbs cells but significantly improved by l-leu treatment for 24 h. c cytochrome c oxidase activity was impaired in rbs cells but significantly improved by l-leu supplement for 24 h. for b and c error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates and the p value was calculated from a t-test



we also examined the translational efficiency of the same  <dig> genes. we found that the translational efficiency of  <dig> genes showed improvement at 3 h and  <dig> genes at 24 h with l-leu . go terms associated with the genes that respond at 3 h were mitochondrial ribosome and respiratory chain, followed with mitochondrial membrane and metabolic processes related to the production of atp, nadh, and cytochrome c at 24 h . overall it appears that for a subset of genes with mitochondrial function, l-leu treatment improved gene expression, and this occurred in conjunction with an effect on translational efficiency for a smaller group of genes in the rbs cells. the expression and translation of a subset of genes with mitochondrial function may be responsive to mtorc <dig> signaling. the genes with increased translational efficiency at 24 h in l-leu are less likely to be direct targets of mtorc <dig> signaling, in contrast to the 5’top, prte, and babel genes.

to further study whether the improved transcription and translation of mitochondrial genes with l-leu manifested in improved mitochondrial function, we measured cellular atp levels  and cytochrome c oxidase activity . these measures of mitochondrial activity in rbs cells were low compared to controls. low atp levels are associated with upregulation of the amp-activated protein kinase  signaling  <cit> , and, consistently, we previously reported an increase in ampk signaling in rbs  <cit> . additionally, the dysfunction of cytochrome c oxidase activity elevates intracellular reactive oxygen species production  <cit> , a finding that correlates well with the previously reported increased ros in rbs cells  <cit> . both atp levels and cytochrome c oxidase activity were partly rescued by stimulation of mtorc <dig> function with l-leu. collectively, our results indicate impaired mitochondrial gene expression, translation, and function are associated with rbs, and these defects can be partially restored by l-leu supplementation, suggesting the defects may be due in part to low mtorc <dig> signaling.

snornas are differentially expressed in rbs cells
snornas guide chemical modification of ribosomal rnas, transfer rnas, small nuclear rnas, and mrnas  <cit> . c/d box snornas guide methylation and h/aca box snornas guide pseudouridylation. these modifications can affect the stability of rnas and their ability to interact with other rnas and proteins. we examined the expression of snornas in rbs cells. many snornas of both types were elevated in the rbs patient cells . l-leu supplement significantly affected snorna levels in both the rbs and corrected cells, but had a bigger effect and partially reversed the increased levels of snornas in rbs cells, suggesting that this gene group may be responsive to mtorc <dig> signaling.fig.  <dig> high levels of snornas in rbs cells were partially reduced by l-leu treatment. we selected a group of  <dig> snorna genes based on the biotype “snorna” and having the words “c/d box” or “h/aca box” in the description field from ensembl. a the boxplot shows the expression of these genes is increased in rbs cells, but partly reduced with l-leu treatment . corrected cells with d-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> e-275; mutant cells with l-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p = 3e-53; corrected cells with d-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e-243; mutant cells with l-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> e- <dig>  p values in a and c were generated using a t test. b the scatter plot depicts the log <dig> fold change for snornas in rbs mutant vs corrected at 3 h d-leu  versus the same for host genes . the correlation is  <dig> . c the boxplot shows the snorna host gene expression was not significantly different between corrected cells and mutant cells, and the host gene expression is not affected by l-leu treatment. corrected cells with d-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> ; mutant cells with l-leu 24 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 24 h, p =  <dig> ; corrected cells with d-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> ; mutant cells with l-leu 3 h versus mutant cells with d-leu 3 h, p =  <dig> . d the scatter plot depicts the log <dig> fold change for snornas in rbs mutant l-leu vs d-leu at 3 h  versus the same for host genes . the correlation is  <dig> 



many snorna genes are hosted by ribosomal protein genes. we found a positive correlation  between snorna levels and the expression of their host gene for the esco2-mutant cells . however, host genes were relatively unaffected with l-leu ; the correlation between host genes and snornas with l-leu treatment was  <dig>  . taken together, these results suggest that the production of snornas may be controlled by an unknown mtorc1-dependent mechanism that does not rely on the expression of the host genes. nevertheless, the increase in snornas in rbs cells has the potential to affect the modification and behavior of many rnas.

the imprinted h <dig> and gtl <dig> loci are differentially expressed in rbs cells
the cohesin complex has been shown to physically regulate expression via looping at the igf2-h <dig> imprinted region  <cit> . igf2-h <dig> shows a parent of origin specific monoallelic expression pattern that is important for embryogenesis and its disruption contributes to the etiology of several fetal disorders  <cit> . the long noncoding rna h <dig> negatively regulates igf <dig> , and h <dig> deletion increases igf <dig> signaling. in addition, h <dig> serves as a precursor of mirna- <dig>  which prevents igf-1r  expression. igf-1r activity promotes downstream pi3k/akt/mtor signaling  <cit> .

we wondered whether the expression of imprinted loci was affected in rbs cells. in fact, several imprinted genes were differentially expressed in rbs cells . for example, rnas involved in growth suppression and stem cell maintenance, including meg3/gtl <dig>  were present at higher levels. another group of rnas from imprinted genes were present at lower levels, including mest, and the p <dig> repressor . h <dig> was significantly elevated in rbs cells . moreover, mirna- <dig> was also elevated , as would be expected based on the elevation in h <dig>  since mirna- <dig> may negatively regulate the pi3k-akt- mtorc <dig> pathway, this h19/mirna- <dig> elevation might contribute to mtorc <dig> depression in rbs. the differential expression of imprinted genes was not significantly affected by l-leu, suggesting the differential expression of these genes is not due to low mtorc <dig> signaling, but may instead be related to defects in gene looping/chromosome architecture and/or altered dna methylation patterns  <cit> .fig.  <dig> imprinted genes are differentially expressed in rbs cells. a a heatmap displays the expression pattern of various imprinted genes in rbs and corrected cells with or without l-leu. b the histograms show the average from three biological samples and the error bar indicates the standard deviation. the results are shown from 24 h treatment with l-leu. the data from the 3 h treatment showed a similar pattern. h <dig> was upregulated ~  <dig> fold in the mutant cells relative to the corrected cells. c the micro-rna  <dig> was elevated ~  <dig> fold in the mutant cells. d the imprinted meg3/gtl <dig> and meg8/rian genes were markedly increased in expression in rbs cells



meg3/gtl2-dlk <dig> is another imprinted locus regulated by differentially methylated regions . cohesin has been reported to colocalize with ctcf at this locus where it binds to the gtl <dig> dmr on the unmethylated maternal allele  <cit> , potentially playing a repressive function for meg3/gtl <dig> expression  <cit> . cohesin binds to the gtl <dig> dmr on the unmethylated maternal allele. gtl <dig> is a growth suppressor that strongly activates p <dig> expression. gtl <dig> regulates maternal expression of an mirna cluster , where it promotes the expression of mirnas that could reduce mtorc <dig> signaling by inhibiting translation of their target mrnas  <cit> . both gtl <dig> mrna and gtl2-regulated mirnas showed an elevation in rbs cells by rna seq analysis which was verified by qpcr . we also found a significant increase in meg8/rian in rbs cells. meg <dig> is a maternally expressed, imprinted long non-coding rna transcribed from the same dna as gtl <dig>  our results suggest that loss of cohesin acetyltransferase function alters expression from the igf2-h <dig> and meg3/gtl2-dlk <dig> imprinted loci, providing one possible speculative mechanism by which cohesin could influence mtorc <dig> signaling and translation.

l-leu independent differential gene expression in rbs cells
homeobox  genes are a group of transcription factors that determine the anterior-posterior axis of an embryo. recent work indicates that cohesin influences hox gene expression through chromatin architecture organization . we examined hox gene expression in rbs cells and found that the expression of many hox a, b, c, and d subunits is reduced  <cit> , independent of l-leu treatment, while translation is unaffected . although taken all together the differential expression for this gene group is not statistically significant between mutant and corrected cells, the reduced expression of many individual genes is significant, and this reduced expression is apparent in the stretch of the boxes into the negative log <dig> values. the data suggest that esco <dig> dependent hox gene expression and architecture is independent of esco2-induced mtorc <dig> defects.

there are over  <dig> differentially expressed genes in rbs cells, but ~ <dig> fewer with l-leu treatment, suggesting a significant fraction of the differential expression could be translation-driven. the most notable and top go term for the upregulated genes in the rbs mutant cells treated with l-leu vs d-leu at 3 h is “respiratory chain complex i” . however, the differential expression of particular gene groups in rbs cells, such as hox genes and imprinted genes, was independent of l-leu. we previously reported that the nucleolar architecture in rbs cells is only rescued by esco <dig> replacement, not by l-leu addition  <cit> . similar to the rdna, these loci may be examples where basic chromatin architecture is dependent on cohesin acetylation and cannot be rescued with leucine.

previous work has shown that regions from almost all human chromosomes associate with nucleoli  <cit> . these regions have been termed nads for nucleolar associated domains. given the disruption of nucleolar morphology in the rbs cells, we wondered whether the expression of genes within nads was affected. we found that genes in many of the domains were differentially expressed in rbs cells . in some cases genes that were not expressed in rbs cells became expressed in the corrected cells, and in other cases the reverse occurred. whichever trend was observed was true for most of the genes within that nad, arguing that the domains are behaving as a unit. the differential expression was mostly independent of l-leu, consistent with the lack of rescue of the nucleolar morphology with l-leu. we conclude that disruption of nucleolar morphology has the potential to affect the expression of genes normally associated with nucleoli.fig.  <dig> nucleolar associated genes are differentially expressed in rbs cells. expression levels of genes located in nucleolar associated domains  is shown in a heatmap for corrected cells  and rbs cells  treated with either d-leu  or l-leu  for  <dig> or 24 h. within each domain, genes tend to show a similar pattern, although some domains show increased expression in the corrected cells while others show reduced expression. in general these patterns are unaffected by the addition of l-leucine. data can be found in additional file 2: table s13



discussion
we provide compelling molecular evidence that l-leu can partially rescue translation initiation and mitochondrial function via its stimulation of mtorc <dig> in rbs cells. ribosome profiling combined with rna seq allowed us to evaluate the contribution of differential expression and translation in rbs. we speculate that l-leu provides partial rescue of translation and translation-dependent gene expression without rescuing cohesin dependent chromatin organization. our data, combined with the existing literature, argues that at least two different mechanisms generate differential gene expression in rbs cells: 1) defects in looping or other aspects of chromosome architecture and 2) loss of translation function. this second mechanism can be targeted by l-leu stimulation of mtorc <dig> signaling. our work suggests the possibility that a few critical loci that contribute to translation, such as imprinted genes and rdna, play a key role in the rbs disorder. l-leu treatment allows us to begin to distinguish between differential gene expression that is dependent on mtorc <dig> signaling versus independent in the esco <dig> mutant. our studies suggest targeting translation with the non-toxic amino acid l-leu may be a productive strategy in human diseases with poor translation, such as the cohesinopathies.

additional human diseases with defects in translation include the ribosomopathies, diseases caused by defects in ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . stimulation of the tor pathway with l-leu in the ribosomopathy diamond blackfan anemia has shown promise as a therapeutic  <cit>  and is currently being tested in a phase i clinical trial. translational control is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism for many different cell types, such as germline stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and neurons  <cit> . another process affected in over  <dig> different human diseases is mitochondrial function. we provide the first evidence that mitochondrial function is affected in rbs fibroblasts, and we further report that l-leu stimulation of mtorc <dig> could promote both translation initiation and mitochondrial function. together these findings suggest that it will be important to study the role of mtorc <dig> in embryo development, cell identity, and mitochondrial function in order to discover strategies to target this pathway to treat human disease associated with translation impairment.

how l-leu stimulates mtorc <dig> has been the topic of debate. two groups have argued that the charged form of the leucine trna synthetase is a key factor in the activation of the ragulator complex that activates tor  <cit> . others have argued that the mechanism may involve direct sensing of amino acids in the lysosome, where mtorc <dig> is located during activation  <cit> . while the exact molecular mechanism is still unclear, our work provides a detailed molecular picture of how transcription and translation respond to l-leu activation of mtorc <dig>  we found evidence that the 5’top and prte-containing mrnas respond more quickly to l-leu than other targets, such as mrnas with mitochondrial function, suggesting that mtorc <dig> stimulation affects immediate targets followed by secondary targets. our study also suggests that pharmacological inhibition of mtorc <dig> with small molecules has similar effects on translational efficiency as genetically-induced depression by esco <dig> mutation.

cohesin and ctcf  co-localize at a significant fraction of cohesin binding sites where these proteins likely directly regulate genome architecture and gene expression. some of these sites include the imprinted genes and the hox genes. recently, the hi-c method has identified that loss of cohesin or ctcf function not only causes the loss of some chromatin interactions, but also leads to the gain of other interactions  <cit> . cohesin appears to positively regulate some loci and negatively regulate others, making the effects of loss of function difficult to predict. however, we have previously provided evidence that acetylated cohesin promotes expression of the ribosomal dna repeats and the formation of nucleoli. ctcf is also important for the formation of nucleoli  <cit> . nucleoli likely provide a keystone for genome architecture , suggesting that disruption in the organization of rdna could have extensive effects on the organization and expression of most chromosomes such as that observed at nads. in the future it will be interesting to analyze chromosome organization in the absence of esco <dig> function and how this impacts gene expression.

partial loss of function in many different cohesin related genes  causes translation defects in yeast, zebrafish, and human cells  <cit> . collectively, these observations suggest that one evolutionarily conserved function of cohesin is to couple chromosome structure with the translational output of the cell. the mechanisms that link these processes may include the role of cohesin in bringing two dna sequences together such as  looping of promoter and terminator within the rdna for effective polymerase recycling and rrna production,  gathering of the rdna repeats into a functional nucleolus which may provide an anchor point for genome architecture, and  regulation of looping of promoter and regulatory sequences and therefore expression at imprinted loci and hox genes. additional mechanisms for coupling chromosome structure to translation may exist. this study provides a gene by gene understanding of how l-leu stimulation of mtorc <dig> affects gene expression and translation.

CONCLUSIONS
esco <dig>  a gene encoding an acetyltransferase for cohesin, is required for normal gene expression and translation. we characterized the effect of l-leu on translation initiation complexes, mitochondrial function, gene expression and translational efficiency in esco <dig> mutant rbs cells in which mtorc <dig> signaling is depressed. we find l-leu provides a significant rescue effect for all of these measures. l-leu activation of mtorc <dig> function may be a useful approach for human diseases with disruption of these functions.
