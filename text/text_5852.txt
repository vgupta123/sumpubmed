BACKGROUND
the prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals, which manifest as infectious, inherited and sporadic  <cit> . the common feature of prion diseases is aberrant metabolism of prion protein prp. in the cells, prp may exist as a heterogenous mix of topological isoforms prpc and may fold into the compact conformation enciphering features of prions prpsc . normal function of prp is elusive. prpc may act both pro- and anti-apoptotically, and prpsc could have a role in the cellular metabolism as well . among other phenotypes, prp could act as a growth factor in the neuronal context  <cit> .

the homologues of human disease genes are expected to contribute to better understanding of physiological and pathogenic processes, and may be regarded as potential drug targets  <cit> . the first discovered prion protein gene prnp homologue was doppel gene prnd, which lies adjacent to prnp in the genomic sequence  <cit> . it was proposed that prnd and prnp arose by an early gene duplication event of an ancestral prn gene. the prnd-coded protein doppel dpl is ≈20–24% identical to prp and shows the same overall protein architecture but their functions diverged along with their sequences  <cit>  and there is no redundancy between the adult testis-specific dpl and ubiquitous prp  <cit> . the prion protein testis-specific gene prnt is adjacent to prnd in the human genomic sequence  <cit> . it was proposed that prnt may be closer to prnd than prnp due to a duplication event that occurred early during eutherian species divergence. however, prnt was not found in mouse, rat and cow  <cit> . the shadow of prion protein gene sprn encoding shadoo sho was annotated in eutherians and fish  <cit> . sho is the only known human prp homologue that contains a conserved middle hydrophobic region.

comparative genomics is the major strategy for analysis of genomic sequences  <cit> . for example, lee et al.  <cit>  uncovered a large number of conserved noncoding sequences in the syntenic human, mouse and fugu hox loci. the first comparative genomic analysis of prnp showed non-coding regions conserved between eutherians, as well as that eutherian prnps have extensively accumulated transposable elements   <cit> . potential cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements  were annotated in the eutherian and marsupial prnp 3'-utrs  <cit> . prnp, prnd, prnt and sprn show similar gene organisations, which encompass two or three exons  <cit> . however, while the eutherian prnp and sprn promoters incorporate cpg islands, the tissue-specific prnd and prnt promoters do not include cpg islands  <cit> . furthermore, prnp and sprn are present in both eutherians and fish  but prnd was found only in eutherians, and prnt was found only in primates  <cit> . yet, some major differences are known between prnp and sprn  <cit> . in eutherians, sprn genes are gc-richer and shorter than prnps and do not harbour tes. furthermore, sprns aligned between human and fish in the long genomic sequence comparisons but not prnps, and there is contiguity between the adjacent sprn and gtp genes conserved between mammals and fish, which was not found for prnps. one hypothesis has been that the sprn gene evolving more conservatively could be redundant with the less conserved, dispensable prnp  <cit> .

we made use of the present availability of vertebrate genomic sequences  <cit> , and we have conducted the most comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of sprn, prnp, prnd and prnt so far. we annotated numerous conserved genomic elements which are potential cis-elements, deduced  <dig> new protein primary structures, performed phylogenetic analysis of the prion genes, and showed that the entire prp conformationally plastic region is conserved between eutherian prps and shos.

RESULTS
 <dig>  comparative genomic analysis of sprn
the present sprn dataset included  <dig> genomic sequences, which were from human and  <dig> eutherians ,  <dig> marsupial ,  <dig> bird ,  <dig> amphibian  and  <dig> fish .

 <dig> . <dig> conserved contiguity between sprn, gtp and paox
we annotated vertebrate sprn local genomic neighbourhoods using the vista tool  <cit>  , together with the gene predictions from vega and ensembl  <cit>  and the sprn-coded cdnas .

the contiguity between sprn and distal genes encoding gtp-binding protein  gtp and peroxisomal amine-oxidase paox is conserved between vertebrates , as known for eutherians and pufferfish  <cit> . in western clawed frog, the relative head-to-tail orientation between sprn and gtp is different. fae is in place of paox in zebrafish  <cit> . these differences may exist due to genomic rearrangements, or due to genomic sequence misassemblies.

on the other hand, genes upstream to sprn differ between vertebrates . the olfactory receptor  <dig> pseudogene olfr <dig> and the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich type  <dig> protein cd163c-alpha gene sr are upstream to sprn in human and chimpanzee, but the olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> , olfr <dig> and sr genes are upstream to sprn in mouse and rat. in the present cow genomic assembly, the pwwp domain containing protein gene lies upstream to sprn. in gray short-tailed opossum, the olfr <dig>  opossum-specific gene provisionally termed olfro <dig>  olfr <dig> and sr genes lie upstream to sprn. the local species-specific expansions of olfactory receptor genes are known in mammals  <cit> . finally, upstream to sprn are the enoyl-coa hydratase gene in chicken and in japanese medaka and three-spine stickleback, the c20orf <dig> homologue in western clawed frog and the vinculin-coding gene in pufferfish.

we also analysed the sprnb genomic contexts in fish. in japanese medaka and three-spine stickleback, sprnb is located between the calsenilin and prp <dig>  genes, as known for pufferfish  <cit> . however, we found no sprnb homologue in tetrapods, which suggests that sprnb arose in the fish lineage after the evolutionary separation between fish and tetrapods.

 <dig> . <dig> sprn-coded transcripts and sage data
in ncbi  <cit>  we found  <dig> sprn-coded cdnas, as well as  <dig> ests . all cdnas are from the central nervous system . the chicken and western clawed frog sprn genes have two exons, as known for eutherians and zebrafish  <cit> .

the majority of sprn-coded ests is from the cns . furthermore, the sprn ests were found in the immune system cells , human kidney and cd34+cd38+ stem cells, mouse lung and chicken muscle, as well as in the human tumor est libraries from the cns, colon, germ cells, lung, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, skin, thyroid and uterus, respectively.

the sagemap  <cit>  data showed human sprn expression in  <dig> sage and  <dig> lsage libraries from the cns . the majority of evidence for sprn expression from mouse sage data is from the cns libraries , but there are also evidences  from the cd24+cd25- t cells, forelimb buds, granulosa cells, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle and testis .

the new sprn expression evidences, together with the annotation of conserved elements in promoters  argue against the initial proposal that sprn expression is highly brain-specific  <cit> , and this discrepancy needs to be resolved experimentally.

 <dig> . <dig> conserved elements in sprn promoters, introns and 3'-utrs
we used vista to identify conserved sprn regions, using human as the base sequence in analysis . only the coding regions are conserved between human and western clawed frog and fish, but both coding regions and non-coding sequences are conserved between human and chicken and mammals.

the putative sprn promoters contain numerous overlapping sp <dig> sites , which are conserved between human and mouse and chicken. sp <dig> typically activates gene expression via gc-rich motifs associated with housekeeping genes and is involved in almost all cellular processes  <cit> . the associations between promoters, cpg islands and sp <dig> sites known for eutherian housekeeping genes, as well as est and sage data  suggest that sprns, like prnps, may be broadly expressed.

the conserved region in sprn introns includes polypyrimidine tracts and 3' intron splice sites . splice sites have relatively low information contents, but not the adjacent intron sequences, which showed elevated substitution rates in comparisons with the synonymous exonic sites  <cit> . within the polypyrimidine tracts, we found potential polypyrimidine tract-binding protein ptb-binding sites  <cit> . ptb is a key splicing repressor in mammals. we also found the potential c-rich intron splicing enhancers  <cit> . these conserved elements may act as the sprn splicing enhancers or silencers.

in the eutherian sprn 3'-utrs, we annotated  <dig> conserved regions, alignments of which are available on request. within these conserved regions, we observed numerous highly conserved short motifs. for example, in the region  <dig> we found  <dig> bp sequences conserved between human and rhesus macaque, small-eared galago, cow, dog and little brown bat , which may bind microrna  hsa-mir-34a, as well as the predicted mirnas mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> . similar rat and mouse sequences  were predicted to bind mirnas when mismatches were allowed  <cit> . therefore, sprn could be a mirna-regulated gene.

 <dig>  comparative genomic analysis of prnp, prnd and prnt
our prnp, prnd and prnt sample included  <dig> genomic sequences that were from human and  <dig> eutherians ,  <dig> marsupials ,  <dig> bird ,  <dig> amphibian  and  <dig> fish .

 <dig> . <dig> prnp is present in all vertebrates but not prnd or prnt
we used vista to annotate genes residing in the vertebrate prnp neighbourhoods, using human as the base sequence in experiments , together with the gene predictions from vega and ensembl. genes lying adjacent to prnp in eutherians, pufferfish and zebrafish are known  <cit> . we described for the first time the local prnp genomic neighbourhoods in marsupials, birds, amphibians and three-spined stickleback.

genes located upstream to prnp differ between vertebrates , which includes the human rp5-1068h <dig>  pseudogene, nm_ <dig> in mouse, cow zinc finger protein zmynd <dig> , chicken prominin  <dig> prom <dig>  mitochondrial atp synthase b chain precursor in western clawed frog atp/b <dig> and leucine zipper-ef-hand containing transmembrane protein  <dig> in three-spine stickleback letm <dig>  the prnp gene is present in all tetrapods, and its homologue prp <dig>  is present in fish  <cit> . due to the extensive divergence of their sequences  <cit> , human prnp did not align with prp2s . the two prp <dig> homologues are present in three-spine stickleback, here referred to as prp2a and prp2b. thus there are three prp genes in three-spine stickleback . prp-like lies adjacent to prp <dig> in all fish, but it is not present in tetrapods  <cit> . prnd is present in eutherians and marsupials, but we did not detect prnd in birds. prnd is absent from fish  <cit> . however, in western clawed frog we found a potential orf encoding a protein which is similar to dpls . although no ests and ab initio gene predictions correspond to this orf, we could not rule out the presence of a prnd-like gene in western clawed frog, suggesting that a duplication of an ancestral gene giving rise to prnp and prnd occurred after separation between fish and tetrapods  <cit> . prnt is present in primates   <cit> . the ras association domain family  <dig> gene rassf <dig> is present in all vertebrates.

therefore, among the prion genes, only sprn and prnp are present in both fish and tetrapods.

 <dig> . <dig> conserved regions in prnp promoters, introns and 3'utrs
using vista comparisons, we identified  <dig> conserved regions in the prnp upstream intergenic regions,  <dig> conserved regions in the provisional prnp promoters,  <dig> conserved regions in the prnp introns and  <dig> conserved regions in the prnp 3'-utrs . some of these regions were already described  <cit> , and we focused here on the most interesting annotations.

the prominent intergenic region lying ≈-12/- <dig> kb upstream to human prnp is conserved between human and chimpanzee and dog . these sequences showed no matches to ests or known genes, and they exceed more stringent conservation criteria for detection of intergenic regulatory elements . the sizes of conserved intergenic regions, their conservation levels, as well as their relative distances from prnps could suggest that they may regulate prnp expression as enhancers or silencers. the shorter aligned regions in rabbit and little brown bat also exceed the more stringent conservation criteria.

one region in prnp 3'-utrs is conserved between human and mammals and birds . this region includes highly conserved nuclear polyadenylation signals, and the  <dig> bp elements, which include the potential cpes  <cit>  and perfectly conserved  <dig> bp motifs abundant in human and mouse, rat and dog 3'-utrs  <cit> . indeed, prnp was annotated as a likely cpe-specific rna binding protein substrate in rat  <cit> , and prp is involved in the development of neuronal polarity in vitro  <cit> .

 <dig> . <dig> conserved regions in prnd promoters, introns and 3'utrs
using vista comparisons, we identified  <dig> conserved regions in the intergenic sequences between prnps and prnds,  <dig> conserved regions in the prnd provisional promoters,  <dig> conserved region in the prnd exon 1s,  <dig> conserved regions in the prnd introns, and  <dig> conserved regions in the prnd 3'-utrs . we showed the most interesting annotations.

the prnd core promoter region  <cit>  is conserved between human and mammals, and it includes highly conserved ccaat, carg and tata elements . prnd has an unclear mode of expression that is developmentally regulated  <cit> . the ccaat boxes are the most critical activator of prnd expression in mouse and cow  <cit> . our analysis suggests that the conserved carg boxes binding serum responsive factor may be involved in regulation of prnd expression.

in the prnd 3'-utrs we found the ttgcaata octamers , which are conserved between primates, dog and little brown bat. the elements were predicted to bind the annotated mirnas called mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig> . <dig> prnt is a te-associated gene
the comparative analyses showed that prnt is absent from mouse, rat, cow and fish  <cit> . the present vista plot showed extensive sequence conservation between human prnt and chimpanzee and rhesus macaque . we compared the human prnt sequence with the eutherian genomic sequences lying between prnd and rassf <dig> , and annotated the prnt orfs from chimpanzee, sumatran orang-utan and rhesus macaque . choi et al. also reported functional prnt orfs in primates  <cit> . however, no prnt-coded orfs were found in the other eutherians. the human prnt-coded protein we called prt is  <dig>   <dig> and 87% identical to the chimpanzee, sumatran orang-utan and rhesus macaque prts, respectively . no signal peptides were predicted for prts, which suggests that prts are intracellular proteins. our attempts to align prts with either dpls or prps were not successful.

tes correspond to ≈35% of human prnt . these elements in primates, rabbit, cow, dog and african elephant  aligned with their human homologues. the processed pseudogene rp51068h <dig>  is present only in primates. the discernable interspersed repetitive sequences comprise the majority of mammalian genomes, and they may be resurrected as new genes  <cit> . tes may acquire coding potential  <cit>  and regulatory functions in promoters, 5'-utrs and 3'-utrs  <cit> . thus the prnt exons could have been partially recruited from tes. for example, the sense line <dig> in human prnt orf may have acquired a coding function. accordingly, prnt could be viewed as a te-associated gene.

 <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of prion genes
from the available genomic sequences, cdnas and ests  <cit> , we deduced a total of  <dig> new protein primary structures, including  <dig> shos which were from chimpanzee , sumatran orang-utan , rhesus macaque , white-tufted-ear marmoset , rabbit , domestic guinea pig , cow , dog , little brown bat , gray short-tailed opossum , chicken , western clawed frog , japanese medaka , three-spine stickleback  and fathead minnow ,  <dig> sho2s which were from japanese medaka  and three-spine stickleback ,  <dig> prp-like which was from three-spine stickleback , prp2a and prp2b which were from three-spine stickleback ,  <dig> prp1s which were from japanese medaka  and three-spine stickleback ,  <dig> prps which were from sumatran orang-utan , thirteen-lined ground squirrel , little brown bat , large flying fox , zebra finch   and western clawed frog ,  <dig> dpls which were from rhesus macaque , white-tufted-ear marmoset , horse , bottle-nosed dolphin , western european hedgehog , little brown bat , african elephant , small madagascar hedgehog , hoffmann's two-fingered sloth  and gray short-tailed opossum . we aligned these sequences with the  <dig> shos,  <dig> sho2s,  <dig> prp-likes,  <dig> prp2s,  <dig> prp1s,  <dig> prps and  <dig> dpls, as well with the potential western clawed frog dpl , and performed phylogenetic analysis.

 <dig> . <dig> phylogenetic tree of prion genes
using the neighbour joining  method, we constructed the first phylogenetic tree including all prion genes . the protein tree topology shows four major clusters. the first major cluster includes shos, sho2s and prp-likes. cotto et al.  <cit>  also noted the clustering of shos and prp-likes  in a separate cluster from prp1s and prp2s. the tetrapode and fish shos grouped in the two separate groups  <cit> . there is a discrepancy between the grouping of the biased sample of mammalian shos and the species tree topology  <cit> , which needs to be re-examined with additional sequences. the second major cluster comprises the fish prp1s and prp2s, which together with the grouping within the cluster agree with the previous analyses  <cit> . the pattern suggests that the subfunctionalization of prp1s and prp2s may have occurred  <cit>  after a whole genome duplication in the fish lineage  <cit> . the third major cluster includes the tetrapode prps. the mammalian prps are positioned on the separate branch. the grouping of the eutherian prps is discordant with the species tree topology, as already known for the prp protein trees  <cit> . the prps from birds and reptiles grouped in the two separate groups, which lie on the branch separate from amphibian prps. the fourth major cluster includes dpls. the more distant western clawed frog dpl is an outgroup to the mammalian dpls, whose grouping is discordant with the species tree topology and needs to be re-examined with additional species. our phylogenetic analysis complements analyses of vertebrate prion genes  <cit> .

 <dig> . <dig> prp plastic region is well conserved in shos
the present sho dataset enabled us to better define the extent of sequence conservation between prps and shos. along the entire prp conformationally plastic region  <cit> , there is 18–25% identity and 28–34% similarity between eutherian prps and shos . therefore, any functional and structural similarity that may exist between prps and shos resides within the prp plastic region. the best conserved stretch of plastic region between prps and shos is the prp transmembrane region , which together with its adjacent basic sequence  regulates the choice of prp topology at the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the conserved potential tm region sequences in shos, as well as their basic adjacent sequences could suggest that a choice of sho topology may be regulated.

we threaded the conserved sequences from several shos onto the left-handed parallel β-helical sequence 3d profile . there is a sensible fit of sho primary structures to the 3d profile, which comprises three rungs and one short loop. the rung  <dig> and rung  <dig> core volumes are more similar to an average of  <dig> Å than those of rung  <dig>  but similar differences were also observed for the prp rung  <dig> core volumes  <cit> . the rung  <dig> l3' and l5' arginines, as well as l3" glutamic acid residues may be tolerated  <cit> . this threading suggests a potential structural compatibility between shos and the left-handed parallel β-helical fold.

 <dig> 
CONCLUSIONS
it is likely that the conserved genomic elements identified in this analysis represent bona fide cis-elements. however, this idea needs to be confirmed by functional assays in transgenic systems.

 <dig> methods
 <dig>  comparative genomic analysis of sprn
we used the public genomic sequences harbouring sprn and adjacent genes from human , chimpanzee , rhesus macaque , small eared galago , mouse , rat , rabbit , cow , dog , little brown bat , gray short-tailed opossum , chicken , western clawed frog , fugu , spotted green pufferfish , japanese medaka , three-spine stickleback  and zebrafish . in the sequences, tes were masked using the slow speed repeatmasker mode  <cit> . we used the avid alignment program implemented in vista to compare human or mouse  with the other  <dig> species, respectively. the empirically determined cutoffs for detection of conserved regions were: 95% identity between human and chimpanzee in  <dig> bp windows, 90% identity between human and rhesus macaque in  <dig> bp windows, 70% identity between human and small-eared galago in  <dig> bp windows, 85% identity between mouse and rat in  <dig> bp windows, 60% identity between base sequence and the other eutherians in  <dig> bp windows, 55% identity between base sequence and the marsupial gray short-tailed opossum in  <dig> bp windows, 50% identity between base sequence and chicken and western clawed frog, respectively, in  <dig> bp windows and 50% identity between base sequence and fish in  <dig> bp windows. using fish sprnbs as blast queries, we searched the available tetrapode genomes in ensembl.

the human_est, mouse_est and est_others est libraries in ncbi were searched using available sprns as queries and blastn. the human sagemap dataset included  <dig> libraries with  <dig> unique tags and  <dig> total tag counts, and the mouse sagemap dataset included  <dig> libraries with  <dig> unique tags and  <dig> total tag counts. we used nlaiii and the human sprn cdna   or the mouse sprn cdna   as queries. in order to avoid the sequencing error bias, a tag count was accepted only if counted at least twice in a library.

we used vista to compare the human sprn gene including  <dig>  kb of its upstream genomic sequence  with the other  <dig> sprn genes and their flanking intergenic sequences, which were each extracted from the long genomic sequences described above. we used alignments between human and species other than primates to define the conserved sprn regions. gene regions conserved above the cutoff values for vista were manually extracted, aligned, inspected and edited using bioedit  <cit> . transcription factor-binding sites in conserved sequences were predicted using tess  <cit> , using the core positions of transfac strings with the maximum allowable string mismatch 10%, minimum log-likelihood ratio score  <dig>  minimum string length  <dig> bp and organism classification vertebrata options. potential cis-elements in sprn introns and 3'-utrs were identified manually. the genomic sequences corresponding to the conserved sprn intron region from orang-utan , sumatran orang-utan  and domestic guinea pig  were found in trace archive.

 <dig>  comparative genomic analysis of prnp, prnd and prnt
we used the public genomic sequences harbouring prnp, prnd and prnt from human , chimpanzee , rhesus macaque , small-eared galago , mouse , rat , rabbit , cow , sheep , dog , cat , little brown bat , european shrew , western european hedgehog , nine-banded armadillo , african elephant , small madagascar hedgehog , gray short-tailed opossum , tammar wallaby , chicken , western clawed frog , fugu , spotted green pufferfish , three-spine stickleback  and zebrafish . we used the vista tool to compare human  with the other  <dig> species, respectively, as in section  <dig> .

from the long genomic sequences, we extracted the prnp and prnd sequences, respectively, together with their adjacent intergenic regions, and compared them using vista. the potential transcription factor-binding sites in promoters were predicted using tess, and the potential cis-elements in introns and 3'-utrs were identified manually. we note that some conserved genomic regions were not evident in the vista plot using long genomic sequences .

using vista, we compared the human prnt gene with the sequences lying between prnd and rassf <dig> from chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, rabbit, cow, dog and african elephant, respectively . for vista, we used unmasked sequences. the new prnt orfs were annotated using genomic sequences , and deposited in ebi as the third party annotations  <cit> . the te analyses were performed using repeatmasker as above.

 <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of the prion genes
using the public genomic sequences, as well as ests and cdnas  <cit> , we identified new sprn , sprnb , prp-like , prp2a , prp2b , prp <dig> , prnp  and prnd  orfs, and deposited them in ebi as the third party annotations. the western clawed frog dpl sequence was translated from jgi <dig> :scaffold_143:1604545: <dig> . for alignments, we also used the previously annotated shos , sho2s , prp-likes , prp2s , prp1s , the balanced set of eutherian prps  <cit>  and a subset of the other tetrapode prps  and a subset of dpls . the protein sequences were aligned using the clustalw program implemented in bioedit. the alignments were inspected and manually corrected, and they include both complete and incomplete sequences. we used mega <dig>  <cit>  to infer the nj phylogenetic tree, using the pairwise deletion option and poisson correction distance. only one new zebra finch prp allele was used for the phylogenetic analysis , so that the nj tree includes  <dig> sequences.

we threaded the potential sho plastic region sequences onto the left-handed parallel β-helical sequence 3d profile  <cit> . the starting point for threading was the sequence of mouse prp β-helical rung  <dig> region , which is highly conserved in shos. a complete triangular left-handed β-helical rung includes  <dig> different positions repeated three times giving a total of  <dig> amino acids. the more conserved positions in the 3d profile are interior-facing l <dig>  l <dig>  l3', l5', l3" and l5" restricted to small hydrophobic residues and threonine and serine. the core rung volume was calculated as the sum of side-chain volumes of interior residues for each complete rung. side-chain volumes were calculated by subtracting the van der waals volume of glycine from the van der waals volume of an amino acid  <cit> .
