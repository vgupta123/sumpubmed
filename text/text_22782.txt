BACKGROUND
novel human pathogens appear at a continually increasing rate. the majority of these agents are zoonotic, and have their origins in wildlife  <cit> . among wildlife sources, bats, mammals of the order chiroptera, are perhaps the most striking, serving as the primary natural reservoirs for many human pathogens  <cit> , including several viruses of notorious lethality in humans: nipah virus  <cit> , hendra virus  <cit> , ebola and marburg viruses  <cit> , and rabies virus. rabies virus is regarded as the most lethal of all human pathogens, and has been found in bats for over a century  <cit> . rabies and other lyssaviruses are now found in many other animals, but phylogenetic studies indicate that these viruses first evolved in bats and transferred to animals of the order carnivora more recently  <cit> . sars-like coronaviruses have also been found in bats  <cit>  and so far provide the closest link to the agent of human sars.

infection by each of these viruses in bats appears to be asymptomatic or of greatly reduced pathology. even rabies virus, for which we have a great wealth of experimental data, and which is regarded as invariably lethal in other mammals, has been shown repeatedly to have decreased virulence in bats  <cit> .

the association of so many human-lethal viruses with bats may be partially attributable to the fact that the order chiroptera to which the bats belong, is the second largest mammalian order, behind only rodentia in total species  <cit> . on the other hand, the unique lifestyles and ecological circumstances of bats makes plausible the idea that the coevolution of bats and their viruses produced unusually virulent viruses and a host antiviral response tuned to suppress them.

if the latter is the case, it will be of great interest to understand the ways in which the several components of the bat antiviral response differ from those in humans and other mammals. the main hurdle to the pursuit of this goal is our paucity of knowledge of bat immunology and almost complete lack of reagents to initiate such studies. what we do have now that was not available a few years ago is the information obtained through large-scale sequencing projects. this information resides, for the most part, in partially-or unassembled genome sequences, and is not practically available for such purposes without further technical developments.

our aims in this paper are to describe the method we have devised for the partial assembly of genome sequencing traces for the inference of gene families, to validate this method on the human interferon alpha family, and to use it for the inference of the type-i interferon families in the bats myotis lucifugus  and pteropus vampyrus .

most pathogenic viruses, including all of the viruses listed above, possess one or more genes that directly antagonize the type-i interferon response  <cit> , indicating a strong coevolutionary pressure between these viruses and the type-i interferon system. in experimental infections of mice with rabies virus, the investigators noted a marked correlation between survival and ifn production  <cit> .

type i inteferons are the primary mediators of one of the earliest stages of the antiviral response in mammals. they are induced rapidly and secreted upon viral infection. cells exposed to these cytokines enter an infection-refractory state induced by signaling through the common type-i interferon receptor complex. in this state, transcription and translation of viral gene products is inhibited, mhc class i expression is upregulated, rna and protein degradation are accelerated . there are  <dig> human functional ifnα genes, as well as single functional genes for ifnβ, ifnε, ifnω, and ifnκ the type  <dig> interferons are highly pleiomorphic, exhibiting both distinct and complex overlapping function  <cit> . all of the known mammalian type-i interferons genes are intronless; their transcripts are neither spliced nor edited before translation, and expression is controlled at the transcriptional level  <cit> .

bat genome projects
there are two bat whole-genome sequencing projects in progress, but neither is complete at this point. one of them will provide coverage at a level that will not produce a reliable assembly. there are in fact a great many sequencing projects underway for which there is no intent to do full coverage  <cit> . the myotis lucifugus genome sequencing project has completed sequencing to approximately 7-fold coverage with  <dig> , <dig> traces thus far. the genome is, as of this writing, being assembled http://www.broadinstitute.org/science/projects/mammals-models/brown-bat/little-brown-bat. the pteropus vampyrus genome sequencing project has produced  <dig> , <dig> genome traces http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/project-species-m-megabat.hgsc?pagelocation=megabat and is slated for completion with 2x coverage. the pteropus project is based on samples from a single individual bat .

the consequence of incomplete coverage is the exacerbation of one of the shortcomings of whole-genome shotgun sequencing: the difficulty of resolving repetitive dna segments  <cit> . if two sequencing traces contain regions of similarity, it may be difficult or impossible to determine whether these traces are derived from the same underlying dna or from two distinct dna segments that are themselves paralogous. this difficulty is not limited to the assembly of highly repetitious intergenic regions, but to the inference of gene families as well.

this latter problem is particularly unfortunate, because gene duplication is a major source of innovative potential in evolution, and the comparative study of gene families among related species is therefore of great interest  <cit> . furthermore, a large proportion of genes in eukaryotic genomes reside in families, including the genes that encode the type-i interferons.

in this paper, we describe a method for the inference of gene family members from unassembled sequencing traces. the method is conceptually straightforward, and is based on an information-theoretic model that accounts for both sequencing error and evolutionary divergence, providing the means to encode the set of sequencing traces. we then seek those partial assemblies that make the total description length of the combined set of sequencing traces as small as possible. this reconstruction provides an estimate of the number of genes in the family and posterior probability mass functions on the dna sequences of these genes.

we first present the model and the algorithm we have developed to minimize the description length and thereby infer the structure of the gene family. we validate the methods by reconstructing the human type-i interferon family genes from sequencing traces from the human genome project. we use this method to infer the type-i interferon families from the sequencing traces from the myotis lucifugus and pteropus vampyrus genome sequencing projects. we examine these genes in comparison with the orthologous families in humans and other mammals. finally, we confirm our inferences by cloning and sequencing genes from four of the interferon families.

RESULTS
inference of gene families from trace archives
in this section, we present the mathematical basis of the assembly method we have developed and provide a concise algorithmic implementation.

we assume a set s of sequencing traces containing regions with similarity to some given gene or genes. in practice, this seed gene would be an ortholog of the genes one is attempting to infer; one collects s using similarity searching on the complete trace archive for the species of interest.

there are g genes in the family, where g is an unknown integer. each of these genes is related to a common ancestor α  and differs from α by the accumulation of mutations, including insertions and deletions. each sequencing trace results from direct templating from one of these genes, and differs from it by sequencing error only. figure  <dig> illustrates the statistical model used for the inferential procedure.

given any two sequencing traces in s, they are related either through sharing the same immediate template , or indirectly, through the ancestor, α, with each having a distinct immediate template. these two alternatives correspond to two different likelihoods. in the first, the differences between the two traces are attributable to sequencing error only, and must be consistent with the reported position-specific quality scores. in the latter, the divergence of the underlying genes from their common ancestor provides an additional source of differences. the difference in description lengths under these two models provides a criterion for choosing between the models. in fact, the criterion we will use for determining the final set of assemblies is the minimization of the total description length of s under the model in figure  <dig>  briefly, the description length is the information required to encode the data and the values of the model parameters.  for any sub-model for pairs of traces that involves mutations from the common ancestor, the description length must account for the information required to encode the mutation rate. if y is the overlap in nucleotides between the two sequencing traces, the cost of encoding the mutation rate is log y.

the objective of the assembly procedure is the minimization of the description length over all topologies of the form shown in figure  <dig>  but there is no method for finding this minimum, short of exhaustive enumeration over all topologies, which is ruled out by practical considerations for all but the smallest s. we therefore adopt a greedy progressive method familiar from its use in multiple sequence alignment. at each stage, we find the pair of sequences  that provide the maximum saving in description length and assemble them, replacing the pair by the new assembly they have formed. the process continues until there are no remaining moves that lead to a description length reduction.

the following section provides the details for the probability model.

quality scores and conditional probabilities
the base-calling software reads the raw sequencing trace and, for each position, reports a single base and a quality score. if the reported base is x, and the reported quality score is q, we take the output to represent a posterior probability mass function  on the latent nucleotide state at that position, given by   

where d represents the data conditioning the estimate, and ε is defined by   

it is not necessary to specify a likelihood function, or even to describe what the nature of d is, so we simply write for the posterior probability mass function on ξ in the jth position in the ith sequencing trace. for simplicity in this presentation, we will assume that the prior pmf on ξ is uniform on a, c, g, t, -.

we will also need the posterior pmf on the ancestral state α, which is obtained by specifying a model for the accumulation of mutations from α to ξ, and summing over the unobserved state, ξ. we take a simple reversible mutation model   

and let   

consider the model partially described by having position i in trace  <dig> aligned with position j in trace  <dig>  the posterior pmf for the latent true nucleotide state is   

where k is the position in the assembly corresponding to i and j in traces  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. is given by   

since the criterion is the minimization of the description length we compare any two models by the difference in their description lengths. the alignment cost, then, is the difference in description length between the model in which these positions are aligned  and the one in which they are independent, and is give by   

denote by a the vector whose components are the indices for the aligned traces corresponding to the kth position in the resulting assembly. then the cost of the alignment is   

for the case where traces  <dig> and  <dig> are related indirectly through a common ancestor, we similarly have   

with the appropriate and obvious definitions. the quantity of primary importance for us is the cost difference between the direct and indirect models for a given pair of traces   

the logarithmic term is the cost of encoding the mutation rate that minimizes the alignment score  <cit> ; the argument  is the number of nucleotides in the overlap of traces  <dig> and  <dig> in the optimal alignment, ie, the number of degrees of freedom available to estimate μ. when c is positive, the indirect model is the more efficient; when c is negative, the direct model is more efficient.

for progressive alignment, note that the posterior assembly pmf and the cost are composed from the individual sequential alignments. suppose we first align traces  <dig> and  <dig> to obtain assembly  <dig>  and then align trace  <dig> to assembly  <dig> to produce assembly  <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  we need to refine our notation for indexing by letting refer to the position in trace i corresponding to position k in assembly a. so, for the example of figure  <dig>  we have   

it is then straightforward to show that the alignment scores are additive:   

and that the assembly posterior pmfs are obtained by composition   

we have shown that the total cost for the composite alignment is given by the sum of the sum of alignment costs, but, as with all progressive alignment methods, the minimum-cost composite alignment may not be the global minimum cost alignment.

the complete procedure, then, is

 <dig>  compute all of the minimum pairwise alignment costs cij using dynamic programming.

 <dig>  assemble the two sub-assemblies with least alignment cost, and replace them with the new assembly that results. compute the pairwise costs between the remaining subassemblies and the new assembly.

 <dig>  continue at step  <dig> until total assembly cost can no longer be reduced.

validation
we validated the method by inferring the human interferon-alpha  gene family directly from the human whole-genome sequencing trace archives, and comparing the results to ifna gene sequences known from the finished human genome . we performed this procedure in three different ways.

first, we collected relevant sequencing traces by performing a blast search using the  <dig> nt-long protein-coding portion of the human ifna <dig> transcript  and retrieved  <dig> traces with expected values less than 10- <dig>  we trimmed each sequence and applied the assembly method described above.

the procedure resulted in  <dig> final assemblies. we compared the inferred genes to the human genome reference assembly. each of these  <dig> assemblies maps unambiguously to one of the  <dig> known ifna genes or the single whole pseudogene at an average error rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per base . in one case, a pair of assemblies mapped to a single genomic gene, ifna <dig>  there are  <dig> single nucleotide differences between the two assemblies mapping to ifna <dig> and one dinucleotide difference. each of the single nucleotide differences is strongly supported, with multiple high-quality reads supporting the inference. the dinucleotide difference is less well supported, with just a single trace covering it in one assembly, though the corresponding bases in this trace are good quality. the evidence strongly suggests that the two assemblies do map to two different alleles of the same gene. accepting this conclusion reduces the error rate to less than  <dig> × 10- <dig> per base. the  <dig> remaining mismatches include a single 4-nucleotide deletion relative to the genomic sequence.

for the next two validation procedures, our intent was to more accurately represent the situation in which the assembler would be used. for this purpose, we used one of the p.vampyrus putative ifna genes rather than human ifna <dig> as the blast query, and selected a subsample of the retrieved sequences to simulate low coverage.

there were  <dig> trace reads in the subset produced by the whitehead institute. assembling these reads using our method produced  <dig> distinct assemblies with two or more reads in each, mapping  to  <dig> different human genomic regions:  <dig> ifnas, human ifnw <dig>  loc <dig> ,  <dig> ifna pseudogenes and  <dig> ifnw pseudogene. one pair of distinct assemblies was mapped, erroneously, to a single ifna. the subset of trace reads from the venter institute consisted of  <dig> sequences, producing  <dig> distinct assemblies with  <dig> or more reads, mapping to  <dig> different regions of the human genome: all  <dig> ifnas,  <dig> ifna pseudogene, ifnw <dig>  and  <dig> regions annotated as either ifnw-like or ifnw pseudogenes. the alignments of these assemblies to the genome revealed  <dig> mismatches in  <dig> total bases. one pair of assemblies was erroneously mapped to a single ifna pseudogene.

type i interferons in myotis lucifugus and pteropus vampyrus
we used the protein-coding portions of the human genes ifna <dig>  ifnk, ifnb, and ifne, the bovine gene ifnt, and murine gene ifnz in blast searches against the whole genome shotgun sequence trace archives for pteropus vampyrus and myotis lucifugus. the sequences retrieved in each of the blast searches were then assembled using the methods described above.

we obtained unique final assemblies for ifnb in each bat. each of these final assemblies contained an intact orf which, when blasted against the ncbi nucleotide sequence database, returned multiple hits on the corresponding gene in several mammals. the greatest similarity was to horse, pig, and cow sequences, with about 80% nucleotide identity.

myotis produced two final assemblies for ifne, both of which contain intact orfs and appear, on close examination, to be genuinely distinct sequences. pteropus produced a single final assembly, which had an intact orf.

the sequencing traces returned in the search on ifna <dig> produced multiple final assemblies that fall into three distinct families with clear similarity to ifna, ifnw, and ifnd , respectively.

 <dig>  two genes encode polypeptides of length 190

 <dig>  one at  <dig> and two at 195

 <dig>  one at 170

no relevant hits to murine ifnz were found in either chiropteran genome. no hits to bovine ifnt beyond those already obtained using other queries were found.

chiropteran type ii interferon
in mammals, the type i interferons have a single exon of fewer than  <dig> bases. ifng, the type ii interferon, has multiple exons. we used our methods to infer the type-ii interferon genes in the two bats by using the full-length human ifng gene comprising introns and exons ). our methods produced a single assembly in each bat . all exons were clearly identifiable and all intronic splice signals were conserved. table  <dig> shows the sequence similarity among the human and bat sequences.

phylogenetics
the intact orfs of the inferred sequences were aligned with the type-i interferons from humans and from the domestic pig, sus scrofa , and as an outgroup, the ifnb and ifna gene sequences from the duckbill platypus . the phylogenetic tree relating these genes was inferred using maximum likelihood .

the features of the inferred phylogenetic tree are consistent with those found in previous investigations  <cit> . in particular, the interferon families fall into distinct clades, with the exception of the platypus ifna genes, which appear ancestral to the ifna, ifnw, and ifnd genes of the other species. within each of the families, the genes fall into clades according to species, with no interdigitation of genes from different species in any clade . additionally, the bat genes from one bat species are typically, but not universally, more closely related to the orthologous genes from the other bat species than to those of pigs or humans. the bat genes are typically but not universally more closely related to the orthologous pig genes than to the orthologous human genes.

sequencing
we used the inferred sequences to design sequencing primers and make several clones from each of ifna, ifnb, ifnd, and ifnk. the results are as follows.

we obtained dna sequences from  <dig> independent ifnb clones from two individual bats. among these,  <dig> distinct but very closely related genes were clearly discernible. one sequence is identical to the consensus of all  <dig> sequences, and is found in  <dig> of  <dig> clones from one bat, and all the clones from the other. given this interpretation, the overall frequency of pre-sequencing pcr error was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per base  the inferred ifnb genes are 91% identical to an ifnb isolated from rousettus aegyptiacus  <cit>  and 80% identical to ifnb from the domestic pig, sus scrofa.

using ifnk primers, we obtained sequences from  <dig> clones from a single animal, and found two distinct genes, differing from each other in two nucleotides. the error rate was consistent with that found in the ifnb genes at  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per base .

for ifnd and ifna, respectively, we collected sequences from  <dig> and  <dig> clones from a single animal. because pcr was used in an amplification step prior to cloning , it is difficult to discern the expected genetic variability from sequencing error. for ifna, four sequences were recovered multiple times from independent procedures. the mean number of mismatches in pairwise comparisons is just under  <dig>  the four sequences are within  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases of the most similar inferred ifna gene. for ifnd, there are three multiply-represented sequences. two of these genes differ at  <dig> bases; the third, which represents a pseudogene, differs from the other two by more than  <dig> bases. these genes differ from their nearest inferred ifnd sequences by  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bases, respectively. additional file  <dig> contains an alignment of the three multiply-represented ifnd clones compared to the ifnd assemblies.

since it was not possible to determine by inspection what the underlying true gene sequences are or how many there are. we instead estimated the posterior probability on the number of genes in each family as described in methods . for ifna, the posterior probability is maximized at g =  <dig> genes; the 90% credible interval is . for ifnd, the greatest posterior probability occurs at g =  <dig> genes, and the 90% credible interval is .

gene expression
to test whether the inferred genes are expressed under conditions known to induce type

i interferons, we designed primers to pteropus ifnb and to a control housekeeping gene  and a gene  induced by paracrine ifnb signaling. the latter two genes were also inferred by the methods described.

fresh pteropus pbmcs from two individual animals were cultured under four different conditions: with lipopolysaccharide , with the synthetic rna poly, with vesicular stomatitis virus , and with culture medium alone.

with lps or poly treatment, ifnb mrna expression was increased 20- <dig> fold by  <dig> hours and decreased slowly to near the starting value by  <dig> hours. oas expression lagged behind that of ifnb, reaching its peak value by  <dig> hours, declining from the peak level only partially by  <dig> hours. in contrast, cells treated with vsv had peak levels of ifnb appear by  <dig> hours and remain almost unchanged to  <dig> hours; oas expression rose more slowly, and had not reached a maximum level by  <dig> hours .

discussion
recent research has demonstrated very clearly that the rate of emergence of human pathogens continues to increasing steadily, and that the source of the majority of these agents is wildlife  <cit> . one of the most intriguing findings of late is that bats are the natural reservoirs of many of the most pathogenic viruses in humans.

while it is known that microbe-host coevolution drives pathogenicity in the natural host, the effect of such coevolution on alternative hosts has not been described. the development of many genome sequencing projects extending beyond domesticated animals provides an opportunity to begin such inquiries. the low coverage levels of these projects and the fact that so many genes with immunological functions appear in large families of very similar genes requires the development of more precise inferential tools for their study.

toward that end, we have developed a method for the assembly of genome sequence fragments for use in the inference of gene family members when the genome coverage is too low for reliable complete assembly. we validated the method on raw, unassembled traces from the human genome sequencing project, finding that we could assemble the known interferon alpha sequences accurately, and further, identify at least one case in which two alleles are present.

it should be noted that our method requires more computation than assembly methods currently in use due to the numerical minimization over the mutation frequency required in eq, and is therefore not suitable for large-scale assembly.

using this method, we inferred a total of  <dig> type-i interferon genes with intact orfs from the whole-genome shotgun trace archives for two chiropteran species, pteropus vampyrus and myotis lucifugus. we find that the largest of the ifn-i gene families in both bats comprises genes orthologous to the ifnw genes in other mammals. in humans, mice and pigs, there is just one ifnw gene but up to two dozen members in each bat. a recent analysis of bovine type-i interferons from the assembled bos taurus genome  <cit>  finds  <dig> intact ifnw genes, providing precedent for our otherwise striking results. in contrast, the ifna family is the largest ifn-i family in several mammals, including humans, mice and pigs, but appears to be smaller in pteropus and absent but for pseudogenes in myotis. the gene family assembly from trace archives indicates that there are  <dig> intact ifna in pteropus; analysis of direct sequencing from pbmcs gives maximum posterior probability to the presence of  <dig> ifna genes , with a 90% credible interval containing  <dig> to  <dig> genes. cattle have  <dig> ifna genes in spite of having a greatly enlarged ifnw family  <cit> .

both bats have multiple members in the ifnd family with five intact members and seven pseudogenes in pteropus, and twelve intact members in myotis. ifnd has been found as a functional gene only in pigs, where the gene product is expressed in the placenta and plays a role in embryonic development  <cit> , but is not suspected of involvement in the response to viruses. it is striking to us that this family seems to have been so dramatically enlarged in bats. the size of this family suggests that it may still be involved in host defense in bats even if it has lost that function in pigs. walker and roberts  <cit>  report finding three ifnd pseudogenes, but no intact ifnd in the cow. it is worth noting that the placental type-i interferon in cattle is ifnt rather than ifnd  <cit> . searching the bat trace archives with bovine ifnt did not produce hits that had not been returned with the other searches. we find no evidence of ifnt or ifnz in either bat.

for ifnb, ifnk, and ifne, we find one member of each in p. vampyrus, and one or two in m. lucifugus. in the case where we do find two genes, we are confident that there the genes are distinct, though they may represent alleles rather than paralogs.

we used the inferred sequences for p. vampyrus ifna, ifnb, ifnd, and ifnk to design oligonucleotide primers for cloning and sequencing and recovered a total of  <dig> sequences. the directly cloned sequences validate much of the gene family inferences; most of the repeated sequences are within a few bases of the nearest inferred gene. a minority of the directly sequenced genes are surprisingly far from the nearest inferred gene. this circumstance may be an indication that there are additional type-i interferon genes not covered by the pteropus sequencing traces, and may also reflect significant population polymorphism in the wild bat population.

we used these same primers to show, using quantitative rt-prc, that the p. vampyrus candidate ifnb and oas <dig> , are expressed upon stimulation by type-i inducing agents. furthermore, the temporal trajectories of this expression is consistent with the known mechanisms of such signaling. the expression of ifnb under viral infection was delayed compared to that under stimulation by the tlr ligands poly and lps.

CONCLUSIONS
the bat has been implicated as a major reservoir for viruses of extreme pathogenicity in humans, and suffers substantially less disease when infected by these viruses than humans do. in addition, bat populations in north america are declining rapidly as a result of white-nose syndrome, an emergent disease associated with a fungal pathogen  <cit> . these facts, and others, suggest that the study of host defense and immunity in these unique creatures would benefit the pursuit of ecological and human health. the major obstacle in this undertaking is the lack of reagents that would make such investigations possible. one way to get this effort underway is to take advantage of the rich store of information contained in existing partial genome sequences. although the information available in these genome databases requires more careful treatment for its extraction than is required for a complete, assembled genome, we have developed methods that facilitate this task, and have demonstrated their utility.
