BACKGROUND
sharks, similar to camelids, possess unconventional heavy  chain antibodies, consisting of heavy chain homodimers in which each chain contains one single variable and five constant domains  <cit> . the conserved amino acid residues between the shark heavy chain antibody and those involved in forming the core of immunoglobulin and t-cell receptor variable regions, gave impetus for naming shark heavy chain antibody immunoglobulin new antigen receptor   <cit> . structural analysis by electron microscopy, crystal structure, and 3d modeling revealed that there are three nar isotypes. these isotypes are defined according to their pattern of inter-loop disulfide linkages within the variable region and the timing of their appearance during the animal's development  <cit> .

using genetic engineering a single nar variable  antigen-binding domain can be expressed as a separate soluble protein often referred to as a shark single domain antibody . shark sdabs contain four conserved frame regions  and two complementarity-determining regions , making them the smallest  ig-based recognition units with full capacity for antigen binding affinity and specificity. due to their small size, they may be able to access antigen epitopes not generally recognized by recombinant conventional antibodies  <cit> . although both shark and camelid sdabs share similar structural features and functional requirements  <cit> , shark sdab lack a conventional cdr <dig>  and contain two hyper-variable regions , hv <dig> and hv <dig>  which may contribute to antigen binding  <cit> . according to the crystallographic analysis of nar v structure, the loop of hv <dig>  located within the fr2-cdr <dig> region, is located across the middle of the molecules and may influence the conformation of the cdr3; moreover, the loop of hv <dig>  located between hv <dig> and cdr <dig>  is formed proximal to cdr <dig> and may influence the antigen binding interactions  <cit> .

similar to camelid sdabs, shark sdabs exhibit excellent solubility for protein production, superior to many recombinant conventional antibodies, and retain conformational stability when heated or refold correctly upon cooling,  <cit> . these intrinsic properties make sdab exceptional alternatives for diagnostic applications. using phage display technology and pcr amplification, the repertoire of the naturally occurring nar v from either immunized or naïve  animals were established and used for panning against target antigens  <cit> . high affinity binders to a specific target were obtained from immunized libraries however required a waiting period for suitable immunization to be achieved and an animal care facility  <cit> . on the other hand, weak binders against a wide variety of target antigens were obtained from naïve libraries; they were selected rapidly and no immunization period was required  <cit> . if higher affinity binders are desired than those obtained from the naïve library, the sdab can be enhanced using in vitro affinity maturation  <cit> .

it is believed that the diversity of naturally occurring nar v results from multiple rearrangements of the cdr genes and somatic hypermutations in vivo  <cit> . consistent with this finding, the complexity of shark nar v usually resides in cdr <dig> with sequence variation within residues 28– <dig> and an extended cdr <dig>  which varies in length  and in amino acid composition. routes to introduce diversity and increase the complexity of naïve libraries include: variation of cdrs via dna shuffling  <cit> , pcr using randomized primers, and random mutagenesis by error prone pcr  <cit>  or dntp analogs  <cit> . although dna shuffling, which involves the recombination of several small dna fragments within a whole variable region, has been successfully used to create a semi-synthetic llama library with giga diversity  <cit> , it has not been used for constructing a more diverse shark display library due to the short nar v dna fragments, less than  <dig> bp in size. instead, pcr using randomized cdr <dig> sequences has been used to construct more diverse synthetic libraries, resulting in binders with higher affinity and specificity to target antigens  <cit> .

our previously described naïve nar v library, sp, from spiny dogfish shark  was successfully panned for the isolation of binders to cholera toxin; however our ability to obtain specific binders towards other targets was disappointing  <cit> . in this study, we expanded the utility of the naive display library by introducing variations in cdr <dig> amino acid composition and length . in this manner, a semi-synthetic nar v display library, spsl <dig>  with a complexity of ~1e <dig> was successfully constructed and used for panning against ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxin b  and bont/a complex toxoid. we successfully selected binders against these three toxins and characterized the purified sdabs using elisa and luminex  <dig> assays. our results suggest that this new diversified nar v display library can serve as a fruitful source of sdabs against a variety of toxins.

RESULTS
library construction and selections
a semi-synthetic shark display library was constructed starting with dna isolated from a naturally occurring spiny dogfish shark library  by randomizing cdr <dig>  most clones in the sp library had loop lengths between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids based on  <dig> sequences . three random primers  were used in pcr reactions with the aim of increasing diversity of the new shark library by varying the length and residues within cdr <dig>  these primers are designed to generate cdr3s with loop lengths of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> amino acids to target the dominant populations. loop lengths of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> amino acids can be used in the future to introduce more diversity if necessary. sequences from  <dig> random clones confirmed that cdr <dig> was composed of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> residues with random combinations of amino acids. among these clones,  <dig> out of  <dig> clones appeared to have full-length sequences,  <dig> out of  <dig> had either frame shifts or deletion products, and  <dig> out of  <dig> clones contained amber codons. since each of the  <dig> clones had a unique sequence, we estimated that the newly constructed shark library  contains ~1e <dig> individual clones, a complexity of ~1e <dig> with ~8e <dig> coding for full-length sdab proteins. compared to error prone pcr and dna shuffling, randomized nucleotides primers generate a higher percentage of clones containing amber stop codons within the cdr <dig> region. however, since phage were prepared from an e. coli amber suppressor strain, the full- length proteins were still displayed on the phage tails during panning enrichment. therefore, the presence of amber codons did not decrease the effective complexity of our new library.

a, b were described in detail as in liu et al.  <cit> .

after three rounds of panning the spsl <dig>  we observed mild enrichment  for seb binding  and strong enrichment  for ricin. the binding enrichments from panning spsl <dig> for both toxins were higher than those from panning the naturally occurring nar v display library, sp . in addition, we observed a 12-fold enrichment for bont/a complex toxoid binding after the first spsl <dig> panning . for each toxin we screened  <dig> clones randomly selected from spsl <dig> panning round  <dig> or  <dig> using monoclonal phage elisa as described in the methods section. from each selection we sequenced  <dig> clones that had a ratio of toxin binding to bsa binding of greater than  <dig>  we obtained two unique seb binding sequences, one ricin binding sequence and two bont/a complex toxoid binding sequences.

sequence analysis
ninety-six clones were screened for each selection and fifteen potential binders for each toxin were sent out for sequencing. unique toxin binding sequence were analyzed using clustalw  <cit>  . the two bont/a complex toxoid binders, p4bh <dig> and p4bf7- <dig>  varied significantly in amino acid composition within the four hypervariable regions, suggesting they target different epitopes. interestingly, they both showed similar binding reactivity toward bont complex toxoid subtypes . the seb binders, p2sc <dig> and p1sd3- <dig>  shared identical cdr <dig>  hv <dig>  and conserved arginine within cdr <dig> but varied in amino acid  <dig> within the hv <dig> region .

the two seb binders along with the bont/a complex toxoid binder, p4bf7- <dig>  had no formation of inter-loop disulfide bonds and shared a conserved w <dig> within cdr <dig>  which are major features of type  <dig> nar v originally defined as appearing only in juvenile nurse sharks less than one year old  <cit> . previously, we discovered that our spiny dogfish nar v display library derived from adult animals over one year old contained approximately 7% of type  <dig> nar v fragments. this may be a unique feature of spiny dogfish shark  <cit> . these type  <dig> spiny dogfish shark nar v differ from ones found in nurse shark, since they exhibited more diverse length and composition with or without a conserved f <dig> in cdr <dig>  <cit> . amino acid composition has a great influence on conformation and stability. as the spiny dogfish shark type <dig> nar v binders lack the invariant aromatic y <dig> and f <dig> found to participate in forming more rigid cdr <dig> loops, they likely exhibit different cdr conformational plasticity than type <dig> nar v from nurse sharks  <cit> . ricin binder, p4ra7- <dig> is an atypical type  <dig> nar v with no formation of inter-loop disulfide bonds due to the lack of cys in the cdrs . one of the bont/a complex toxoid binders, p4bh <dig>  is an atypical type  <dig> nar v that lacks cys residues in fr <dig> and fr <dig> but contains two cdr <dig> cys residues, which allows the formation of an intra-loop disulfide bridge to stabilize cdr conformation. the mechanism of cdr conformation stability for these atypical nar v should be different from their corresponding typical nar v and is a topic for future investigation. it is likely that hv <dig> and hv <dig> may play extremely dominant roles to stabilize cdr conformation  <cit> .

expression of soluble monomeric sdabs
five selected binders were sub-cloned to the pecan  <dig> expression plasmids, a gift from dr. andrew hayhurst, for overproduction  <cit> . monomeric soluble protein was purified using a nickel affinity column followed by gel filtration  <cit> . expression levels for these five binders varied. yields for p4bh <dig>  p4bf7- <dig>  and p4ra7- <dig> were about  <dig>  mg per liter of bacterial culture; this is similar to the yield of hen egg white lysozyme binders isolated from a repertoire of nurse shark nar v  <cit> . the production amounts for the two seb binders, p1sd3- <dig> and p2sc <dig>  were about 6-fold less. the difference in expression levels may be due to overall conformation stability and domain surface charges resulting from sequence and structural diversity. however, we did not observe a good correlation pattern between the clone sequences and the expression levels based on the comparison of amino acid residues. structural and 3d modeling studies for these clones are required to reveal more information about correlations between protein expression level and sequence variation.

direct binding to determine affinity and specificity
binding affinity and specificity was determined using direct binding assays with toxoid-coated and toxin-coated microspheres as described in the methods. the equilibrium constant  for each sdab and conventional antibody was calculated from direct binding curves using the formula, y = x/ . this calculation let us compare the sdab and conventional antibodies. overall, the affinities of the selected binders were in the 100's of nm, many times that of conventional antibody, however they could be used as scaffolds for further affinity maturation studies .

the isolated ricin binder, p4ra7- <dig>  bound specifically to intact ricin and ricin a relative to irrelevant targets, ct, bont/a complex toxoid and seb, suggesting it is a ricin a chain binder . its superior specificity makes it an ideal candidate for further affinity maturation. one of the bont/a complex toxoid binders  was fairly specific to bont complex toxoid subtypes, but the other  showed significant non-specific binding to ricin and ct . the measurement of direct binding for the ricin binder  and ct binders isolated previously  <cit>   to microspheres with bont complex toxoids immobilized to their surface showed no significant interaction, indicating that the sdab do not as a class nonspecifically bind bont complex toxoids. thus, the non-specific binding observed for any binder selected appears to be intrinsic to just that sdab, however it points out the necessity to critically evaluate specificity for binders derived by this or similar methods. nonetheless, for the bont binders selected, both had stronger binding to the three tested bont complex toxoid subtypes, e, b, and a than to irrelevant targets . generally, they appeared to bind subtypes e and b even more than a , suggesting that toxoid complexes derived by formalin-inactivation may share some common epitopes among subtypes . since p4bf7- <dig> specifically cross-reacts to other complex toxoid subtypes it may be useful for generic bont detection, as opposed to subtype classification. the anti-bont sdab were also tested for their binding to a range of bont subtypes using the various toxins as wells as their toxoids immobilized on microspheres. both bont/a binders showed considerable cross-reactivity to other bont subtypes; this binding was significantly greater than binding to irrelevant targets . to obtain specific bont/a toxin binders, more library screening may be necessary; however these selected binders may find use for sample enrichment purposes, a critical need for such a potent toxin.

the seb binders showed very different binding affinity and specificity despite their identical cdr <dig> and homologous cdr <dig> sequences . p1sd3- <dig> bound to seb specifically relative to irrelevant targets, while p2sc <dig> exhibited more non-specific sticky interactions with irrelevant targets, ct and ricin . moreover, p1sd3- <dig>  has ten-fold better binding affinity  than p2sc <dig>  . a recent affinity maturation study showed that changing s <dig> to r <dig> within the hv <dig> in nurse shark nar v contributed to increased binding affinity resulting from more van der waals' contacts on the mature sdab  <cit> . the change of k <dig> to e <dig> within hv <dig> in p1sd3- <dig> might exhibit a similar effect and perhaps resulted in observed higher binding affinity and specificity of p1sd3- <dig> compared to p2sc <dig> . p2sc <dig> and p4bf7- <dig> had identical sequences for most regions except cdr <dig> and amino acid  <dig> in hv <dig>  the resulting differential binding reactivity to all tested toxins suggests that cdr <dig> alone may play a major role to determine the binding specificity in these two clones.

thermal stability determinations
our results indicated that the ricin binder showed better thermal stability than polyclonal antibody, and was similar in stability to the monoclonal antibody tested . upon heating, the ricin binder still retained its specificity showing insignificantly binding to irrelevant targets, ct and seb . both bont/a complex toxoid binders retained a substantial amount  of the original binding activity after being heated for  <dig> min at 85°c, while non-specific binding was actually reduced over the same period . overall, they showed much better thermal stability than conventional antibody, which lost activity rapidly upon heating .

of the two, p4bf7- <dig> appeared to be more stable than p4bh <dig> , suggesting that it might have a more stable cdr conformation. the conformational stability may partially result from the formation of an intra-loop disulfide bridge within cdr <dig> . interestingly, p4bh <dig>  showed 30% more than initial binding reactivity to target, upon heating for  <dig> min . this phenomenon is often seen in sdabs, possibly due to better binding of the refolded structure that results from a short period of heating and rapid cooling; this same phenomenon may also be the cause for improvements in specificity  <cit> .

both seb binders exhibited better thermal stability than tested conventional antibodies . they showed similar thermal stability profiles, suggesting both share a similar cdr conformation resulting from similar sequences .

use of sdab as reporter reagents in sandwich assays
sandwich assays using sdab in conjunction with ni-sa-pe as tracer reagents were performed as detailed in the methods. capture antibodies including irrelevant antibody as a negative control, conventional antibodies and sdabs were used. ricin binder, p4ra7- <dig>  was able to detect ricin at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml, using monoclonal antibody or llama sdab ric e <dig> as the capture reagents and showed no binding to the negative control beads coated with ct antibody, lx-ct-c <dig> . for bont sandwich assays, llama anti-bont was used as the capture reagent for either bont/a or b complex toxoids, which was subsequently detected at a concentration of  <dig> ng/ml by p4bf7- <dig> using ni-sa-pe to generate signal . as might be expected, the rab anti bont/a showed good selectivity, capturing bont/a complex toxoid, but not b complex toxoid . for seb sandwich assays, the specific seb binder, p1sd3- <dig> was used as a tracer and could detect seb at a concentration of  <dig> ng/ml with insignificant non-specific signal observed on the control microspheres . in general, we were able to demonstrate the use of sdabs as reporter reagent in sandwich assays.

CONCLUSIONS
the sdabs selected from the new randomized naïve shark library exhibit serviceable specificity and excellent thermal stability, but their binding affinity was weaker than the conventional antibodies tested. often, affinity maturation is required to obtain high affinity binders. besides the common approaches described in the background section, 3d structural modeling also provides a powerful tool to reveal more detailed information regarding the change of amino acids within the constant regions and hvs  <cit> . however, the typical increase in binding affinity has been only 10-fold using these approaches, which would still not produce binders comparable to the best conventional antibodies  <cit> . alternatively, multiple copies of sdabs against the same target can be linked together to generate high avidity structures  <cit> , which can result in three orders of magnitude higher affinity than the monomeric sdab. this may be a more attractive way to improve binding reactivity for our sdab .

in the future, we may need to introduce more variation in the cdr <dig> loop length in combination with the preferred insertion of cys into defined cdr <dig> positions. construction of a more diverse library, containing a greater percentage of conventional type  <dig> and  <dig> nar sequences may allow us to obtain specific binders for each bont subtype for detection purpose. nevertheless, our results indicated that the new semi-synthetic shark library had better cdr <dig> diversity and better utility than our previously established naturally occurring nar v display library, suggesting this may be the correct path towards obtaining a limitless source of sdabs against a variety of toxins for sensor applications.
