BACKGROUND
in addition to its role as proteinogenic amino acid, and as a molecule involved in responses to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses, proline has been implicated in plant development, particularly flowering and reproduction
 <cit> . the first convincing evidence that proline may play a key role in plant reproduction under normal unstressed conditions, came from measurements of free proline content in a number of plant species, which revealed low levels of proline in vegetative tissues followed, after flower transition, by proline accumulation in reproductive tissues and organs
 <cit> . chiang and dandekar
 <cit> , for example, reported that free proline accumulates in arabidopsis reproductive tissues up to 26% of the total amino acid pool, while in vegetative tissues represents only 1-3%. among floral organs, different authors
 <cit>  pointed out that the floral organ with the highest proline content is pollen, where proline may represent more than 70% of the total amino acid content
 <cit> .

it is not clear, to date, the reason for such a massive proline accumulation in pollen. because pollen grains undergo a process of natural dehydration, a role of compatible osmolyte capable of protecting cellular structures from denaturation, has been proposed by some authors
 <cit> , while others
 <cit>  have postulated a role for proline as a source of energy or as metabolic precursor to support the rapid and energy-demanding elongation of the pollen tube. on the other hand, the rapid elongation of the pollen tube requires extensive synthesis of cell wall proteins
 <cit> , some of which are rich in proline or hydroxyproline stretches, and proline accumulation may be needed to sustain the synthesis, at high levels, of proline-rich cell wall proteins
 <cit> .

irrespective of its function, proline may accumulate in pollen due to an increased transport from external sources, or to an increased ratio between synthesis and degradation of endogenous proline, or because of a combination of the two, but no conclusive evidence has been produced, as yet, to distinguish among these alternative models. long distance transport of proline through phloem vessels has been documented
 <cit>  and since atprot <dig> , a gene encoding an amino acid carrier recently shown to mediate proline uptake in plants, is highly expressed in mature pollen
 <cit> , transport has been proposed to account for proline accumulation in pollen grains. however single, double, and triple knockout mutants for all the genes belonging to the atprot family are available, and none of them show difference, compared to wild type, neither in proline content, nor in pollen germination efficiency
 <cit> , raising the possibility that endogenous proline synthesis may be responsible for, or contribute to proline accumulation in pollen.

in higher plants proline synthesis proceeds from glutamate that is converted to proline in a two-step pathway catalyzed by the enzymes Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate ynthetase , and Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase . the existence of an alternative route for proline synthesis, converting ornithine to proline by the action of δ-ornithine-amino-transferase  and p5cr, has been hypothesized by some authors
 <cit> . however the relevance of this pathway for proline synthesis has been recently questioned
 <cit>  and glutamate may be the only precursor of proline synthesis in plants. p5cs, regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme for proline biosynthesis in plants, is encoded in arabidopsis by the two paralog genes p5cs <dig>  and p5cs <dig> 
 <cit> , while no paralog genes have been described for p5cr .

t-dna insertional mutants have been characterized
 <cit>  for both p5cs <dig>  and p5cs <dig> , providing hints for assigning gene functions. p5cs <dig> is responsible for abiotic stress-induced proline accumulation, as homozygous p5cs <dig> mutants do not accumulate proline upon stress induction and are hypersensitive to environmental stresses
 <cit> , while p5cs <dig> is necessary for embryo development, as homozygous p5cs <dig> mutants are embryo lethal and the p5cs <dig> mutant allele can be propagated only in p5cs2/p5cs <dig> heterozygous mutants
 <cit> . in addition, both genes have been shown to modulate flower transition in arabidopsis, as the flowering time of mutants homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig>  is more delayed than that of the single p5cs <dig> mutant
 <cit> .

in the course of a genetic screen designed to identify the floral pathway proline interacts with in arabidopsis , we found that the p5cs <dig> mutation was rarely transmitted to the offspring when the proline-deficient p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> was used as a pollen donor suggesting yet another role for proline in affecting male fertility. this prompted the analysis presented in this work, aimed to evaluate the role of endogenous proline in pollen development and fertility. we show here that the development of the male gametophyte carrying mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> is severely compromised, indicating a role for proline in pollen function and development.

RESULTS
in crosses between p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig>  used as male, and arabidopsis flowering time mutants, used as females, aimed to understand the flowering pathway proline interacts with , the p5cs <dig> mutant allele was always transmitted to the outcrossed progeny, while the transmission frequency of the p5cs <dig> mutant allele was exceedingly low . since no obvious gametophytic defects have been ever noticed neither on p5cs <dig> nor on p5cs <dig> single mutants, this result suggests that a male fertility defect may be linked to pollen grains bearing mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> genes.

segregation of the p5cs <dig> mutant allele in a seed population from self-pollinated p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants is consistent with the presence of a gametophytic mutation
to verify the fertility defects of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants, the segregation of the sulfadiazine gene – a dominant resistance marker associated to the t-dna insertion on p5cs <dig> – was analyzed in a seed population from selfed p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants. since the homozygous p5cs <dig> single mutant is embryo lethal
 <cit> , we expected that the segregation of the p5cs2-linked sulfadiazine resistance in the selfed population would approximate a 2: <dig> ratio of resistant over susceptible plants. if, on the other hand, the segregation ratio for the p5cs <dig> mutant allele should approximate a 1: <dig> ratio, a fertility defect for the gametophyte carrying both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> mutations would be confirmed. to clarify this point,  <dig> seeds, from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants, were planted on sulfadiazine plates in six independent experiments. as shown in figure
 <dig>  the p5cs <dig> mutation segregated in a 1: <dig> resistant:susceptible ratio, as about 50%  plantlets were sulfadiazine resistant , consistent with the hypothesis that the p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> gametophyte is infertile and can hardly transmit the p5cs <dig> allele to the sporophytic generation.

the absence of aborted embryos in p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> siliques is consistent with a gametophytic mutation hampering homozygous formation
to further confirm the gametophytic defect of the p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutant, the incidence of embryo abortion was examined in the siliques of p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig>  aborted seeds could be observed in the siliques of a self-pollinated heterozygous p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutant, accounting for about 25% of the total seeds and corresponding to the genotype p5cs2/p5cs <dig>  compared with about 1% of spontaneous seed abortion found in wild type siliques . however, in case a gametophytic defect should impede homozygous formation, the absence of aborted embryos in the siliques of p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> would be expected. indeed, as shown in the right part of figure
 <dig>  p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> siliques show a wild type-like phenotype with less than 1% aborted seeds. these data are in agreement with the hypothesis that the  gametophyte carrying both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> alleles is rarely transmitted to the offspring.

reciprocal crosses between p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> and wild type confirm the male gametophytic defects associated to pollen grains mutated in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs2
to confirm genetically the male sterility of pollen grains carrying both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> mutant alleles, reciprocal backcrosses were made between p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> and wild type plants. all seeds produced by the outcrossed siliques were collected and germinated on sulfadiazine-containing media, to follow the transmission of the p5cs <dig> mutant allele . as shown in table
 <dig>  when pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants was used to fertilize wild type pistils, the p5cs <dig> mutant allele could be transmitted to the progeny only in  <dig> out of  <dig> plants , producing a p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> genotype. in contrast, transmission of the p5cs <dig> allele in reciprocal crosses occurred in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases, suggesting that mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> have no effects on the female gametophyte.

reciprocal crosses between mutants homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig> and wild type plants. *** significantly different from the expected segregation ratio of 50% .

to confirm these data at molecular level,  <dig> individuals were randomly chosen from each outcrossed progeny  and analyzed by pcr for the presence of the t-dna insertion on p5cs <dig> , and on p5cs <dig> . as shown in the top panel of figure
3b, when p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> was used as a male, a combination of primers specific for p5cs <dig> and for the t-dna vector pac <dig> could not detect the presence of a t-dna insertion on p5cs <dig> . on the contrary, when p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> was used as a female, a pcr product specific for the t-dna insertion on p5cs <dig> was amplified in  <dig> out of  <dig> samples , providing molecular support that the transmission of the p5cs <dig> mutant allele is compromised in male, but not in female gametophytes from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants. in addition, as shown in the bottom panel of figure
3b, all the samples analyzed detected both the presence of a mutant p5cs <dig> allele , by using a couple of primers specific for p5cs <dig> and for the t-dna vector prock, and the presence of a wild type p5cs <dig> allele , by using a primer pair specific for p5cs <dig>  indicating that the chosen plants derived from an outcrossing event, and excluding the possibility of an unintended contamination from self-pollinated parental genotypes. overall, the reciprocal crosses with wild type plants provide genetic and molecular evidence that p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> is impaired in male fertilization.

morphological and functional analysis of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants reveals severe defects in pollen development
if p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> pollen is impaired in male fertilization, morphologic abnormalities in pollen grains may be expected. indeed, as shown in figure
 <dig>  microscopic analysis of mature pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants, stained with acetic orcein, revealed , alongside normal-looking grains, a population of small, misshaped and shriveled pollen grains, roughly accounting for half of the total pollen population . this evidence indicates that in plants homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig>  the development of the male gametophyte is impaired and suggests that this defect may arise in pollen of p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> genotype. to understand at which stage of pollen development the aberrations took place, toluidine-stained histological cross-sections of p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> anthers, from different developmental stages
 <cit> , were prepared and analyzed in comparison to wild type. as shown in figure
 <dig>  the first clear differences between p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> and wild type anthers appear from stage  <dig> , when two populations of pollen grains – one similar to wild type, and another showing smaller size and initial signs of degeneration - can be distinguished in the pollen sacs. in order to assess whether this small abnormal pollen is vital, pollen grains from wild type and p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants were treated with alexander’s stain, a staining procedure capable of distinguishing viable, red-colored pollen from non viable, green or unstained pollen
 <cit> . as shown in figure
 <dig>  a population of small and abnormal pollen grains, representing  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the total pollen grains, appear selectively unstained when treated with alexander’s stain . in contrast, the larger and normal-looking pollen present in the pollen population from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants, takes up alexander’s stain and appear as red as wild type pollen . in addition, within the pollen population from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants, while the large pollen grains seem to have a normal nuclear content, the small and unviable pollen grains appear degenerated and devoid of dna as judged by dapi  and pcr analysis . indeed, in dapi-stained pollen grains from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig>  no nuclei were ever observed in the small and abortive pollen grains, while up to three nuclei can be seen in the large and normal-looking pollen grains, as in normal pollen .

in vitro germination assays confirm that p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> pollen is essentially non viable, and suggest a quantitative role for proline in pollen development
to further investigate the pollen viability of p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants, an in vitro germination assay was performed to test the capability of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants to germinate in vitro , as compared as to wild type pollen . as reported in figure
 <dig>  when pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants was grown on solid germination medium, the percentage of germinated versus total pollen , including both large and small pollen grains, was reduced by ~ 50%  compared to wild type . the fact that the germination percentage of wild type pollen was, on average, only  <dig> ±  <dig> % can be accounted for by the relative inefficiency of this kind of experiments. it is known that in vitro germination cannot fully substitute for in vivo germination, with germination percentages showing ample variations
 <cit> . in order to minimize this inherent variability, all experiments were carried out by placing, on the same microscope slides, pollen from wild type controls close to pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants. since genetic analysis indicated that half of the pollen grains from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants are of p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> genotype, and morphological observations showed that ~ 50% of the pollen grains from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants are small and misshaped, it is likely to hypothesize that all the aberrant pollens are p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig>  according to this notion when large and small pollen grains are scored separately, all the small and degenerate pollen grains  should fail to germinate, while all the large and wild type-looking pollens  should elongate a pollen tube. to verify this point, the percentage of pollen germination was calculated separately for large and small pollen grains, either as number of large germinated pollen grains out of total large pollen grains, or as small germinated pollen grains out of total small pollen grains . unexpectedly, while small pollen grains were never observed to germinate , the germination percentage of the large pollen grains vs. total large pollen grains from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants was not 100%, but accounted for only 89% of that of wild type , as shown in figure
10f, middle column, suggesting that the two pollen populations may not be pure, i.e. some pollen of p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> genotype might occasionally have degenerated and looking small, while some pollen of p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> genotype may be not, or not completely, degenerated and yet looking large. to clarify this point, pools of either large or small pollen grains were analyzed by pcr for the presence or absence of t-dna insertions in p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig>  as shown in figure
 <dig>  no dna could be amplified from the small pollen population, as expected from their morphological and functional degeneration and apparent absence of intact nuclei. when dna from the large pollen population was examined for the presence of mutations in p5cs <dig>  only the t-dna insertion on p5cs <dig> could be amplified , confirming that the large pollen grains are vital and indicating that the whole population contains the mutated p5cs <dig> allele, as expected from a line homozygous for the p5cs <dig> allele. however, when dna from the large pollen population was examined for the presence of mutations in p5cs <dig>  both wild type and mutant p5cs <dig> allele were found, as witnessed by the presence of specific pcr products for both wild type and mutant p5cs <dig> gene , confirming that the wild-type like pollen contains, to some extent, pollens carrying mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig>  the presence of pollens containing mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> within the large, wild-type looking pollen population, suggests that pollen with genotype p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> is likely present within the degenerated pollen population. the simplest interpretation of these results is that proper development of the male gametophyte is dependent from proline availability, and that pollens of genotype p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> may contribute to some extent to the overall fertility defect of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants. an important implication of this reasoning is that pollen defects similar to, but less severe than those found on pollen grains from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants should be present in pollen grains from homozygous p5cs <dig> single mutants. accordingly, mature pollen was collected from a homozygous p5cs <dig> single mutant, and analyzed for pollen morphology and vitality by microscopic analysis, alexander's stain, dapi stain, and in vitro germination assay. as shown in figure
 <dig>  microscopic and functional analysis of p5cs <dig> pollen grains revealed the presence of misshaped , non-viable  and degenerated  pollen grains, although to a lesser extent  compared to pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants. moreover, as shown in additional file
2: figure s <dig>  pollens from p5cs <dig> single mutants grown on germination medium, exhibited a ~ 12% reduction of germination rate, compared to wild type pollens. as seen in additional file
2: figure s <dig>  a the percentage of germinated versus total pollen, including both large and small pollen grains, is  <dig> ±  <dig> %, compared to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of wild type control, confirming that male gametophytic defects are present, to a lesser extent, in p5cs <dig> single mutants too. in addition, when large and small pollen grains are scored separately , the percentage of large versus total large germinated pollen is  <dig> ±  <dig> %, compared to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of wild type control, while small pollen grains were never seen to germinate. as in p5cs <dig> single mutant the percentage of large germinated pollen grains is not significantly different from that of wild type pollen grains, the 12% reduction of germination efficiency must be accounted for by the small and degenerated pollen fraction.

proline content analysis and exogenous proline treatment of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants provides a direct correlation between proline and pollen development
on the whole, the data presented above point to a requirement for p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> in pollen development and functionality. to establish a direct correlation between proline and pollen development, we measured the proline content of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants, compared to wild type. about  <dig>  mature pollen grains from either wild type or p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants were collected on a microscope slide and processed with a modification  of the bates method
 <cit> . the measurements were repeated in three independent experiments and expressed as average values ± se. a clear difference in proline content was detected between the two pollen populations, as  <dig> ±  <dig> ng of free proline, roughly corresponding to  <dig> pg/pollen, was detected in wild type pollen, while only  <dig> ±  <dig> ng of free proline, corresponding to  <dig> pg/pollen of proline, could be detected in the mixed pollen population  from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants. the low content of proline measured in pollen from mutant plants , compared to that found in wild type pollen , provides a direct correlation between proline deficiency and pollen defects. because in a pollen population from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants, approx 50% of the pollen grains look aberrant, a ~ 50% reduction of proline content is expected. however, a proline reduction exceeding 70% was detected in pollen from mutant plants. this result suggests that the observed proline reduction cannot be accounted for only by the abortion of the small misshaped pollen, but that a reduction in proline content must take place, to some extent, also in the large wild type-looking pollen grains. in addition,  <dig> μm l-proline was supplemented in vitro to mature pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants grown on germination medium, or in planta to developing anthers. as shown in figure
 <dig>  while no significant effect on pollen germination was produced by proline supplemented in vitro , a significant complementation of pollen defect was observed when proline was sprayed daily to inflorescence buds, from early developmental stages to fully developed dehiscent anthers: the percentage of aberrant pollens decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , and the percentage of germinated pollens increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . this indicates that exogenous proline can partially rescue the defects of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants, when supplemented from the beginning of pollen development, confirming that proline plays a role in pollen development.

discussion
on the basis of crosses showing that pollen with genetic defects in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> is almost completely unable of a successful fertilization, a requirement for proline in male gametophyte viability was hypothesized and demonstrated here, by means of genetic, developmental and molecular evidence.

proline is required for pollen development and fertility
massive accumulation of proline has been reported in anthers and pollen by different authors in a number of species
 <cit> , but it is not yet clear why such high amount of proline is required. functions as diverse as free radical scavenger
 <cit> , protector of membranes and cellular structures
 <cit> , energy source
 <cit> , metabolic precursor
 <cit> , and main amino acid constituent of hydroxyproline-rich cell walls
 <cit>  have been proposed but none of these possibilities has attained wide acceptance, and the interesting hypothesis that multiple functions may be accounted for by proline action has been suggested
 <cit> .

evidence provided in this work indicates that pollen from mutants homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig> can transmit the p5cs <dig> mutation with an overall frequency of about  <dig> %, and that mutants with decreasing levels in proline content
 <cit>  have increasing problems in pollen viability indicating that proline is required for male fertility.

proline accumulation in pollen may rely on endogenous proline synthesis
apart from the defects in pollen development described in this work, and from a delay in flower transition described by mattioli et al.
 <cit> , the vegetative and reproductive growth of mutants homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig>  including the development of the female gametophyte, is essentially normal. this evidence implies that the small amount of proline coming from the activity of the wild type p5cs <dig> allele, always present in the sporophytic tissues of p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig>  is sufficient for normal growth and reproduction, but not for proper pollen development.

the specific requirement of proline for pollen development and function, is confirmed by the high amount of proline found in pollen by different authors
 <cit> , by the very low level of proline measured in mutant pollen, and by the partial rescue of pollen defects obtained by exogenous proline treatment. while this complementation provides direct proof that proline is required for pollen development and function, it gives no indication whether the required proline derives uniquely from endogenous synthesis inside the pollen or also from proline synthesized in nearby mother cells and transported or diffused inside pollen grains. this point clearly needs to be understood in future works.

however, since pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> is infertile, a possible transport or diffusion of proline synthesized in surrounding sporophytic cells by the residual p5cs <dig> allele is obviously insufficient. furthermore, single, double and triple knockout mutants of the atprot genes  responsible for proline transport in plants, have been isolated and characterized but none of them revealed alterations, compared to wild type, neither in proline content nor in pollen germination efficiency
 <cit> . although the possibility that different carriers, such as atlht <dig> 
 <cit>  or atlht <dig> 
 <cit> , may compensate, overlap to, or substitute for atprots, current evidence does not support a role of transport for proline accumulation in pollen grains. in addition, microarray data indicate that all the genes involved in proline synthesis are strongly expressed in pollen
 <cit> , and data from szekely et al.
 <cit> , who detected in the pollen of arabidopsis the expression of both atp5cs1–gfp and atp5cs2–gfp, confirm the presence of the p5cs protein in the male gametophyte. overall these data suggest that proline is actively synthesized in pollen.

the question whether proline may be synthesized directly in pollen grains has been the object of controversial discussions, because some authors could detect low
 <cit>  or no expression of p5cs in pollen
 <cit> , while others reported the presence of an atp5cs-gfp protein in the pollen of arabidopsis, suggesting that biosynthesis of proline takes place in this organ
 <cit> . however, the discrepancy in the expression levels of p5cs gene as observed by different authors
 <cit> , may depend on the developmental stage in which pollen was analyzed, and we may speculate that p5cs1/ <dig> genes could be expressed only in particular stages of pollen development, and still accumulate enough p5cs enzyme to satisfy overall proline demand for pollen maturation. temporal discrepancies between transcript and protein levels have been reported in pollen also for other genes, such as atsuc <dig> , whose transcript level is high at tricellular stage and low in mature pollen
 <cit>  and atstp <dig> , whose gene product can only be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy after the onset of germination
 <cit> . in addition, as above stated, high levels of expression of either p5cs <dig>  p5cs <dig>  and p5cr are detected in pollen by microarray analysis
 <cit> , directly confirming that endogenous proline synthesis from glutamate takes place in pollen grains. unexpectedly, microarrays analysis also detects the expression of δ-oat in pollen, although ornithine pathway seems not able to compensate p5cs deficiency in pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig>  these contrasting pieces of evidence can be reconciled if ornithine pathway does not contribute to proline synthesis. incidentally, this evidence supports the finding of funck et al.
 <cit>  who demonstrated that the ornithine pathway is essential for arginine catabolism but not for proline synthesis.

overall, proline accumulation in pollen may rely essentially on endogenous proline synthesis, although is yet to be understood whether proline derives uniquely from endogenous synthesis inside the male gametophyte or also from proline synthesized in nearby sporophytic cells and transported or diffused inside pollen grains. a likely hypothesis is that, as pollen lose desmosomal connections to surrounding sporophytic cells, becomes dependent on endogenous proline synthesis, consistent with the late appearance  of visible aberrations in developing pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig>  and with the absence of obvious defects in female gametopytes, always embedded in sporophytic cells.

relationship between p5cs and p5cr mutants
intriguingly, two arabidopsis mutants bearing t-dna insertions on p5cr, emb-2772- <dig> and emb-2772- <dig> <cit>  exhibit an embryo lethal phenotype, similarly to p5cs <dig> mutants, halting embryo development at a preglobular stage. in sharp contrast, however, no gametopytic defects have been associated, so far, to these mutants.

while it is not surprising that lesions in p5cr and p5cs <dig>  two genes coding for proline synthesis enzymes belonging to the same pathway, may lead to similar defects in embryo development, it is puzzling that, contrary to p5cs <dig>  emb- <dig> exhibits no gametophytic defects. in arabidopsis a number of mutants have been described by muralla et al.
 <cit>  with defects in embryo but not in gametophyte development.

to explain this apparent paradox, the authors propose that gene products derived from transcription of wild type alleles in heterozygous sporocytes may compensate the deficiency of the mutant gametophytes, and that embryo lethality results when these products are eventually depleted. likewise, we may speculate that, contrary to p5cs <dig>  the p5cr transcript and/or protein, synthesized in heterozygous sporocytes, is stable enough to sustain pollen but not embryo development.

proline may have distinct roles in pollen development and germination
the data presented here suggest that proline is required for pollen development, but gives no indication on the role of proline in pollen development. we know from histological analysis  that a fraction of pollen grains begins to look shriveled and shrunk from stage  <dig>  when, after completion of the two mitotic divisions, the microspores start their maturation to pollen grains. as pollen development proceeds, it becomes more and more desiccated, and increasing amounts of proline may be needed to avoid protein denaturation and preserve cellular structures, including nuclei, as hypothesized by chiang and dandekar
 <cit> . a role for proline in the protection of cellular structures from denaturation has been proposed by different authors either as compatible osmolyte
 <cit> , scavenger of free radicals
 <cit> , or as protector of membranes and cellular structures
 <cit> . although, from available data, a defect in mitotic divisions cannot be ruled out, the degeneration of the cellular structures observed in pollen grains of p5cs <dig> p5cs <dig> genotype, may be caused by the irreversible damages on cellular membranes caused by the process of dehydration in absence of the protective action of proline.

once pollen has reached full maturation, accumulated proline is catabolized and serves as source of energy - to fuel the rapid and energy-demanding elongation of the pollen tube
 <cit>  - and/or as metabolic precursor of γ-amino butyric acid , the catabolism of which has been shown essential for late pollen tube elongation and guidance
 <cit> .

in the future it will be interesting to address this issue by uncoupling these two putative functions, for example targeting in developing pollen grains from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants non-metabolizable compatible osmolyte, such as glycine betaine. equally interesting it will be to dissect the role of proline synthesized in the haploid male gametophyte from that synthesized in diploid sporophytic tissues of the anther.

CONCLUSIONS
we show here that in mutants homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig>  defective in proline synthesis, the development of the male gametophyte with mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> is severely compromised, and provide genetic evidence that proline is needed for pollen development and fertility.
