BACKGROUND
three-dimensional  cell culture is defined as the culture of cells in the presence of an extracellular milieu that promotes the formation of multicellular structures in the x, y and z axis  <cit> . three-dimensional culture permits the study of epithelial cell arrangement into tissue structures, and the investigation of pathways critical for the establishment and maintenance of structural and functional aspects of tissue differentiation. however, the basoapical tissue polarity axis, a critical feature of normal epithelial differentiation, remains difficult to replicate with human cell systems.

in glandular and tubular epithelial structures, in which epithelial cells are organized as one layer surrounding a lumen, the establishment of apical polarity characterized by the formation of cell-cell adherens and tight junctions accompanies lumen formation  <cit> . this organization provides a proper functional barrier to regulate vectorial secretion and intake of molecules. tight junctions are typically localized at the top third of the region of the cell pole opposite to that in contact with the basement membrane ; they seal the intercellular space and establish apical polarity by providing physical segregation between the basolateral and apical domains of the cell membrane. the basal cellular pole is characterized by transmembrane integrin dimers that connect cells to specific extracellular matrix  molecules of the bm  <cit> .

the presence of specific types of laminins in the ecm environment used for 3d culture has been shown to be critical for the basal polarization of epithelial tissue structures  <cit> . while basal polarity and growth-arrest are routinely used as features of the differentiation of human epithelial structures in 3d culture, the presence of apical polarity is less often emphasized. studies have acknowledged the presence  <cit>  or absence  <cit>  of apical tight junctions in breast and colon human epithelial differentiated tissue structures produced in 3d culture and on filters, respectively. however, the culture conditions to replicate the apical pole of the polarity axis have not been investigated.

the need for human epithelial models that replicate the tissue polarity axis, including models of lumen formation with their associated tight junctions, is well illustrated by pathologies in which the alteration of apical polarity is a critical step. apical polarity loss, as defined by the formation of multilayers of cells or the lack of basal positioning of nuclei, has been used as a parameter for the characterization of early lesions in certain cancerous diseases  <cit> . when apical polarity organization is altered, as shown by the redistribution of tight junction markers away from apicolateral sites, mammary epithelial cells can be pushed into the cell cycle  <cit> . this suggests that proper apical polarity is critical for maintenance of epithelial breast tissue homeostasis. viral and bacterial infections depend on apical polarity for their onset and/or spreading  <cit> .

we have used the model of breast acinar differentiation and several types of 3d culture systems to evaluate how the establishment of basoapical polarity is influenced by the extracellular environment. we show that basal polarity and collagen iv contribute to the establishment of apical polarity. moreover, we are proposing a simplified high-throughput  culture method to produce basoapically polarized acini from human cells. this method permits direct imaging with low background staining and rapid handling of tissue structures for proteomic and genomic investigations thus, opening new avenues for high-throughput screening on tissue structures.

RESULTS
apical polarity is more sensitive to culture conditions than basal polarity
the mammary gland is composed of tubuloacinar structures that branch and terminate into acini capable of secreting milk. resting acini are characterized by a small central lumen , whereas secreting acini  have a larger lumen . a mammary acinus/alveolus is made of an internal and continuous layer of luminal epithelial cells that exert secretory functions and an external and discontinuous layer of myoepithelial cells. both myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells make contact with bm components via integrin dimers, while only luminal cells show the presence of apical tight junctions.

the use of one cell type, the epithelial cells, to reproduce acinar differentiation is a simplified yet efficient model to study the function of luminal epithelial cells in vitro. the human mammary epithelial cell line, hmt- <dig> s <dig>  <cit> , has been extensively used to study mammary acinar differentiation in 3d culture  <cit> . they form basoapically polarized acini with tiny lumens when cultured in defined h <dig> medium  <cit>   in the presence of bm components laminin  <dig>  and collagen iv-rich gel  <cit> , the matrigel™ used either in solution in the medium with the cells resting on a gel coat  or as a thick gel in which cells are totally embedded   <cit>  . the s <dig> cell model recapitulates the formation of hemidesmosomes with α6β <dig> integrins  <cit>  that are critical for the establishment of basal polarity and are observed in vivo  <cit> . immunostaining for α6- or β4-integrin is routinely used to assess basal polarity in 3d cultures. in addition, a continuous layer of major bm components, like differentiation inducer laminin  <dig>   or collagen iv, should be present at the periphery of the acinus  <cit> . apical polarity can be assessed by immunostaining for the core tight junction protein zonula occludens, zo- <dig>  <cit>  which, like in vivo, should be compartmentalized to the apical side of epithelial structures, against the lumen . an important characteristic of the morphogenesis of glandular structures is the narrow width of the apical pole compared to the basal pole of cells  <cit> . microinjection of acinar cells with rhodamine in 3d-matrigel™ drip cultures revealed a triangular cell shape with the narrowest pole terminating toward the center of the acinus .

to investigate the importance of the culture conditions in the formation of the basoapical polarity axis, we compared 3d culture conditions of two widely used non-neoplastic breast epithelial cell lines. the h <dig> medium with 5% 3d-matrigel™ drip is normally utilized to culture s <dig> cells to induce acinar differentiation in  <dig> days  <cit>  and the assay medium with 2% 3d-matrigel™ drip is used with non-neoplastic mcf10a breast epithelial cells to induce differentiation in  <dig> days  <cit>  . more than 93% of acinar structures showed correctly localized bm-component collagen iv, regardless of the culture conditions and cell lines. in contrast, upon  <dig> days of culture scoring for zo- <dig> distribution revealed an approximately 88% increase in s <dig> acini with loss of apical polarity in the assay medium-2%matrigel™ drip compared to s <dig> acini formed in their usual h <dig> medium-5%3d-matrigel™ drip. on average  <dig> % of the acinus-like structures formed by mcf10a cells showed correct apical polarity in the h <dig> medium-5%3d-matrigel™ drip compared to 0% in the assay medium-2%3d-matrigel™ drip . for the 10-day culture normally used with the h <dig> medium-5% 3d-matrigel™ drip condition, the apical location of zo- <dig> was still found in a low percentage of mcf10a acini  compared to s <dig> acini . immunostaining for additional tight junction markers, par <dig> of the par3/par6/apkc apical polarity complex and pals <dig> of the crumbs/pals1/patj apical polarity complex  <cit>  showed their concentration to the apical side of cells in normal breast tissue and in the majority of s <dig> acini, while they were mostly diffusely distributed in the structures formed by mcf10a cells  . electron microscopy confirmed the presence of apically localized tight junction structures in s <dig> acini . thus, changing the culture conditions, even in the presence of ecm-inducer of differentiation , dramatically influences apical polarity.

the type of substratum used for 3d culture affects apical polarization in differentiating cells
to further analyze the importance of culture conditions for phenotypically normal epithelial differentiation, we sought to determine the effect of substrata used in different 3d cell culture systems currently available on the formation of a complete basoapical polarity axis.

matrigel™ has been the gold standard for 3d culture of different types of epithelial cells due to its high content  in differentiation and basal polarity inducing molecules, like laminin  <dig>  <cit> . as long as passages are performed according to strict cell culture guidelines , appropriate matrigel™ lots should reproducibly trigger basoapical polarity in a differentiation capable cell line, as shown by a defined range of basoapical markers . we first compared extracts of bm obtained from chicken ovary, known to induce the differentiation of ovarian cells  <cit> , to matrigel™. chicken basal lamina  extracts contain laminin  <dig> and other constituents of the bm   <cit> . however, in contrast to matrigel™, cbl originates from normal tissue, and it is not used as a gel; it is used in solution. s <dig> cells cultured in the presence of cbl extracts formed growth-arrested and basally polarized acini  that developed on small focal accumulations of cbl material. interestingly, no staining could be detected for endogenous collagen iv around acini, and the number of acini with apically localized zo- <dig> was significantly lower compared to 3d-matrigel™ drip control cultures .

an ecm-deprived puramatrix™ gel has been successfully used to culture rat hepatocytes in 3d and restore aspects of functional differentiation  <cit> . this substratum is made of peptides that self-assemble into a 3d hydrogel with a nanometer scale fibrous structure. in contrast to matrigel™ and cbl obtained from animals, the composition of puramatrix™ should not vary. thirty percent of the population of s <dig> cells cultured solely within puramatrix™ for  <dig> days was still in the cell cycle, as shown by expression of the cell cycle marker ki <dig>  in addition, structures formed by s <dig> cells were devoid of basoapical polarity . ecm-receptor α6-integrin was found at all cell membranes, collagen iv was mostly nondetectable, and zo- <dig> was observed at all cell membranes and within the cytoplasm. addition of 20% matrigel™ to puramatrix™ restored cell cycle exit but triggered proper collagen iv and α6-integrin distributions in only 32% and 28% of the acini population, respectively . insufficient restoration of basal polarity in the acini population was confirmed with basal polarity marker laminin  <dig> . addition of matrigel™ or laminin  <dig> to puramatrix™ failed to trigger apical polarity, as measured by zo- <dig> distribution, in the majority  of the acini population . thus, neither the proper localization of basal polarity marker α6-integrin nor the addition of ecm-based differentiation inducers  is sufficient to produce apical polarity in cbl and puramatrix™-based cultures to the same extent as that seen in usual 3d-matrigel™ drip cultures.

development of high-throughput culture for basoapically polarized acini
the substrata used in the previous section are difficult to prepare and/or manipulate and did not promote the formation of the complete polarity axis. ready-to-use novel substrata based on nanostructural reproduction of an ecm  have been used to trigger spheroid formation with breast tumor cells  <cit> . we asked whether this secm might provide a structural framework sufficient to reproduce basoapical polarity. once plated on secm, s <dig> cells formed a flat monolayer with occasional piling up of cells . however, when 5% matrigel™ was dripped into the culture medium upon plating cells on secm, acini formed, displaying basal polarity and apical polarity to the same extent as that induced by 3d-matrigel™ drip culture . to assess whether secm played a critical role in induction of polarity upon addition of 5% matrigel™, we cultured s <dig> cells directly on glass in the presence or absence of a drip of matrigel™ in the medium. s <dig> cells formed a monolayer of cells devoid of polarity in the absence of matrigel™, whereas adding a drip of 5% matrigel™ led to the formation of basoapically polarized acini in a percentage similar to that observed in secm with 5% matrigel™ drip or usual 3d-matrigel™ drip cultures . thus, the drip of matrigel™ in the culture medium is sufficient to induce basoapical polarity without precoating the culture surface with a gel.

three-dimensional-matrigel™ drip culture normally requires extensive manipulation for set-up and analysis. ultimately acini have to be removed from the surface of the gel coat for optimal protein and rna extractions. moreover, the gel coat creates high background that impairs immunostaining analysis. therefore, the technique of 5% matrigel™ without gel coating was further explored for potential use as high-throughput  culture method. culture time was shortened by removal of egf at day  <dig> of culture instead of day  <dig>  followed by analysis of differentiation efficacy at days  <dig>   <dig> and 8; the matrigel™ concentration was also varied in order to optimize the extent of polarization in the acini population. a matrigel™ concentration of 20% increased the number of areas with flat monolayers of cells compared to cultures performed with  <dig> and 10% of matrigel™ drip. scoring for basal polarity marker α6-integrin and apical polarity marker zo- <dig> showed that  <dig> and 10% of matrigel™ drip gave results similar to that obtained with regular 3d-matrigel™ drip cultures, suggesting that the 5% matrigel™ drip typically added for 3d-matrigel™ drip cultures can be used in htp cultures; . analysis of polarity for each of the culture conditions  revealed that the duration of cell culture period could be reduced to eight days instead of  <dig> days .

interestingly, the low amount of apically polarized structures in cbl and puramatrix™+ matrigel™ cultures was accompanied with the lack of collagen iv around most multicellular structures. using the htp culture we assessed the relative contribution of collagen iv and laminin  <dig>  signaling to apical polarity formation . blocking signaling via β4-integrin  using function blocking antibodies significantly decreased the number of acini displaying apical polarity compared to nonspecific igg-treated acini in 5% htp cultures, suggesting that basal polarity-related signaling triggered upon attachment to the bm was important. although blocking signaling via β1-integrin  reduced the number of apically polarized acini, this reduction was not significant . it is important to notice here that our results were obtained starting from acini. in previous work, it was shown that blocking β1-integrin signaling from day  <dig> of mammary epithelial cell plating, thus prior to acinus formation, led to apoptosis  <cit> . the difference in these results can be explained by the fact that the predominance and/or function of integrin signaling changes as acinar morphogenesis occurs, notably β4-integrin signaling becomes critical to maintain epithelial homeostasis in acini  <cit> .

to further assess the effect of major molecules responsible for bm integrity on apical polarity formation, we added collagen iv and/or laminin  <dig> to htp cultures made from a percentage of matrigel™ small enough to produce a lower quantity of apically polarized acini compared to control 5% htp culture. starting from a 2% htp culture, a significant increase in the number of apically polarized acini was observed upon addition of a combination of laminin  <dig> and collagen iv, but the increase was not significant with either molecule added alone . none of the conditions applied above altered α6-integrin distribution . adding solely laminin  <dig> and collagen iv, without the htp culture conditions, was not sufficient to allow cells to round up and form acini, suggesting that other compounds or conditions present in the matrigel™ are also necessary for acinar morphogenesis. based on these results, both basal polarity-directed signaling and collagen iv appear to contribute to apical polarity formation.

discussion
the analysis of the different methods of culture of human mammary epithelial cells has enabled us to demonstrate that the development of apical polarity in tissue structures is more sensitive to culture conditions than the production of basal polarity. such sensitivity might account for the difficulty in visualizing tight junctions at the apical pole of acini. strains of non-neoplastic cells should be used based on their differentiation capabilities. for instance strains of mcf10a cells that notoriously lack the capability to form apically located tight junctions under usual culture conditions, as shown by fluorescence immunostaining and structural analysis by electron microscopy  <cit> , have been used to confirm the critical role of genes, like crumbs <dig> in the establishment of apical polarity. non-neoplastic hmt- <dig> s <dig> cells capable of acquiring basoapical polarity represent a very useful model to develop studies that require well-differentiated tissue structures. with these cells we could identify certain 3d culture conditions necessary for the production of basoapically polarized structures. notably, by testing different ecm environments we observed that cbl-based 3d culture was not accompanied with the deposition of collagen iv, a bm component critical to stabilize bm integrity  <cit> . this culture condition might be of interest to better understand the role of collagen iv in epithelial differentiation, notably, as suggested by our data with the htp culture, in the establishment of apical polarity. the molecular mechanism underlying the lack of apical polarity formation in cbl culture remains to be understood. possibly, chemical factors necessary for apical polarity formation might be absent from cbl extracts. more excitingly, there is also a possibility that the mechanical environment of the cells might influence apical polarity. indeed extracellular matrix stiffness was shown to affect the morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . it would be interesting to develop an experimental design to specifically assess the effect matrix stiffness on apical polarity.

our experiments with function blocking antibodies directed toward integrins underscore the importance of the tissue context for the response to ecm alterations. indeed blocking either β1-integrin or β4-integrin signaling led to differentiation outcomes different from those obtained in previous work  <cit> . this is because such previous experiments were performed before acinar morphogenesis, while our experiments were conducted on already formed acini. these experiments illustrate the impact of tissue architecture resulting from acinar morphogenesis that not only affects the organization of the signaling network  <cit> , but also structural organization all the way to the cell nucleus  <cit>  and thus, influences how cells respond to changes in their microenvironment.

the fact that basoapically polarized tissue structures can be produced relatively rapidly  and without the gel coat under 5% htp culture conditions, opens new avenues for high-throughput screenings. with the htp culture it should become possible to obtain large numbers of polarized tissue structures necessary to perform measurements that require large amounts of cellular material. importantly, the htp culture method will be useful, in combination with microscopy techniques, for rapid screening of the effects of environmental factors and drugs on breast epithelium homeostasis . the large number of individual tissue structures produced under these conditions will allow for meaningful statistical analyses. this type of analysis was previously impaired by the thickness of the culture due to the gel coat and/or the nonspecific background signals due to the gel. a simplified method to produce glandular tissue structures should lead to the implementation and/or development of novel tests to help answer biological and medical questions.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate an important role for the bm in the establishment of apical polarity, suggesting that any extracellular factor that perturbs either cell-bm connections or the stability of the bm  would rapidly affect the functional integrity of the epithelium and possibly its homeostasis since apical polarity proteins have been linked to proliferation control and cancer development  <cit> . due to the prominent role of apical polarity in early stages of cancer development, it is paramount to have a model that permits the identification of factors that control such polarity. we believe that the htp culture developed here for breast epithelial cells could provide an important tool for high content screening of risk and protective factors of epithelial architecture and thus, homeostasis.
