BACKGROUND
eukaryotic mitochondria are monophyletic and originate from the bacterial phylum alphaproteobacteria  <cit> . one of the descendant lineages, the animal mitochondrion, contains a circular dna molecule around  <dig> kb in length. it comprises  <dig> transfer rnas ,  <dig> protein-coding genes , two ribosomal rnas , and one or more non-coding regions including the control region  <cit> . mitochondrial sequences have been the most popular genetic markers for many types of studies, including disease detection  <cit> , species identification  <cit> , phylogeography  <cit> , and phylogenetics  <cit> .

mitogenomic data are effective for revealing higher-level relationships of diverse animal groups . although sanger sequencing has been used to obtain high-quality mitogenomic sequences, the time required for primer design, and the cost invested to recover large numbers of mitogenomic sequences remains challenging. recently, next-generation sequencing  methods have been shown to overcome such shortcomings  <cit> . this makes practical the task of re-examining and re-evaluating phylogenies with much larger datasets.

in the second largest insect order lepidoptera, there were  <dig> mitogenomes representing  <dig> species on ncbi . however,  <dig> of the  <dig> submitted mitogenomes were from the genus bombyx,  <dig> of the  <dig> species were from butterflies , and only ten of  <dig> currently recognised superfamilies have been covered . for inferring molecular phylogeny, mitochondrial sequences have been questioned on the basis that they are too saturated to distinguish deep-level relationships  <cit> . though some studies point out that other mitochondrial genes have more relevant information than the most commonly used cox <dig> or rrnl genes  <cit> , researchers have instead focused on using nuclear genes to infer phylogenies. to evaluate sufficiently the utility of mitogenomes in inferring lepidopteran relationships at the level of family and below, here we focus on the well-known group of brush-footed butterflies, nymphalidae.

the family nymphalidae was chosen as our primary focus, firstly because this group represents the most diverse butterfly family with  <dig> subfamilies,  <dig> genera and  <dig>  species, that is one third of all butterfly species . secondly, nymphalidae is also arguably the most utilised lepidopteran family in biological studies as they are distributed in various habitats worldwide and include many model species for ecological, conservation, evolutionary and developmental studies . thirdly, there is a good existing framework against which to judge our results, because the backbone relationships of nymphalidae have been inferred based on dense sampling of both morphological characters and dna sequences  <cit> . nymphalidae phylogeny is far from fully resolved though, because although groups at subfamily and tribal levels appear to be monophyletic, some nodal support at these levels remains weak with no topological consensus. in particular, the branching pattern at deep nodes remains unresolved: both subfamilies libytheinae and danainae have been placed as sister to the rest of the family, but without strong nodal support   <cit> . also in the subfamily case study we focus on here, the grouping of the tribes  in the limenitidinae has been inconclusive due to low support values   <cit> .

there is also a particular prior interest in the tribe limenitidini, as these butterflies include models for the evolution of mimicry  <cit> . the mimetic wing patterns of limenitis butterflies are considered to evolve multiple times and hybridised frequently  <cit>  and the wing patterns of these gliders have converged to an extraordinary degree for butterflies not widely thought to be müllerian mimics with strong predator unpalatability  <cit> . the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary patterns of the american limenitidini butterflies have been analysed in particular detail  <cit> . by contrast, the phylogenetic relationships of palearctic limenitidini butterflies have been almost neglected. even though some studies have used nuclear  and mitochondrial genes  to investigate the relationships of east asian limenitidini  <cit> , results based on these genes are still unresolved and poorly supported. a further study even showed a polyphyletic relationship of the genus athyma <cit> , part of which had a sister relationship with limenitis butterflies  <cit> . further effort is needed to clarify the relationship of this group and unravel the evolutionary basis of mimicry.

the molecular data deposited in public databases have taxonomic biases and annotation errors  <cit> . however, they still enable the testing of various strategies of data partitioning and substitution models to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic inference  <cit> . branch lengths differ greatly when different substitution models are applied, potentially producing different topological and molecular dating estimates  <cit> . the mitogenome has long been considered as a single non-recombining locus because of maternal inheritance, storing substantial numbers of mutations heterogeneously distributed among genes  <cit> . the lack of extensive taxon sampling across nymphalidae, however, has impeded the evaluation of the effects of different partitioning methods on mitogenomic phylogenies. a denser coverage of nymphalid mitogenomes subjected to various partitioning methods is needed for accurate reconstruction of phylogenies in this group.

the aim of this study was to establish a highly supported phylogeny for the nymphalidae using  <dig> mitogenomes obtained from both our pyrosequencing-derived mitogenomes  and those previously deposited in genbank . the combined datasets were used to evaluate nodal supports using  <dig> different partitioning strategies  and two categories of substitution models. finally, the phylogenies inferred from entire mitogenomes and single genes were compared to assess topological congruence.

RESULTS
sequence information
a total of  <dig> mitogenomic sequences  were obtained from two roche junior runs . after quality control treatments and sequence assembly, a total of  <dig>  pyrosequencing reads were obtained . the mean length of read was  <dig>  bp with mean quality q-score  <dig> , indicating that the error rate of our sequences is near  <dig> . sequence coverage was not uniform . generally, highest coverage regions were located at both ends of the amplicons, whereas low coverage regions  were often found near the control region or in the trnas region between the nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes in cases where these regions contained polymeric stretches or tandem repeats . the low sequence recovery for some species might have been caused by unequal dna estimation. details about the lengths sequenced via pyrosequencing and sanger methods, overall sequence coverage, and gaps, are shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
an overview of  <dig> newly sequenced mitogenomes. the sequencing regions derived from pyrosequence-assembled contigs, sanger sequencing, and gaps are shown.



to verify sequence information, most gaps and low-coverage regions were checked via sanger sequencing. this also allowed us to fill in many gaps. however, some ambiguous sites remained unresolved . six major undetermined regions are listed here:  for athyma perius,  <dig> ambiguous sites in the control region;  for dichorragia nesimachus, an undetermined 33-bp length within the rrnl gene;  for euthalia irrubesens, a 52-bp region within a ta-repeat noncoding region between the trne and trnf gene;  for neope pulaha, a 16-bp region in the nad <dig> gene;  for tanaecia julii, a 25-bp region within a ta-repeat noncoding region between the trne and trnf genes; and  for sumalia daraxa, a 601-bp fragment containing part of 3’ end of the nad <dig> gene and trns <dig> gene which failed to sequence. the ratio of these sites was below  <dig> % of our total sequenced mitogenomes . this proportion of missing data seems not to seriously affect the evaluation of phylogenetic utility.

the lengths of these new and published mitogenomes are quite conserved between 15- <dig> kb. neptis soma has the shortest sequence length , whereas papilio maraho has the longest  . although most length variation was found in the control region, some additional lengths were also observed among these  <dig> mitogenomes. there was a 150-bp additional stretch found between the nad <dig> and trnw genes , a region including 11- <dig> repeats that are found between the trne and trnf genes , a 41-bp length found between the nad <dig> and cob genes , a 34-bp fragment found between the trnl <dig> and rrnl genes , and a 59-bp fragment observed in the centre of the rrnl gene , and finally a 37-bp fragment found in the rrns gene of ypthima akragas.

the gene order and orientation were the same in all  <dig> assembled lepidopteran mitogenomes. this alignment suggests that the arrangement of three trnas  between the control region  and the nad <dig> gene can be inferred as a derived character relative to the insect ground plan, cr-i-q-m-nad <dig> <cit> . the a + t compositional ratio of the obtained mitogenomes ranged from  <dig> - <dig> % , which is within the range of most insect mitogenomes  <cit> .

the 37-gene aligned matrix contained  <dig>  bp, of which  <dig>  bp was derived from the  <dig> pcgs,  <dig>  bp from the two rrna genes, and  <dig>  bp from the  <dig> trna genes. a total of  <dig>  polymorphic sites,  <dig>  of them parsimony-informative, were identified . removing the four outgroups resulted in  <dig>  variable sites,  <dig>  of them parsimony-informative. both the numbers of variable and parsimony-informative sites were lower in the 15-gene dataset than those in the 37-gene dataset . however, the ratio of informative sites to polymorphic sites was slightly higher than that in the 37-gene dataset. a similar pattern was also found in the 13-gene dataset.

sequence variable sites were not homogeneously distributed across the gene . most polymorphic sites were found towards the 5’ or 3’ ends of genes, while relatively conserved regions were found towards the centre of pcgs. two genes  had the most variable regions, whereas the 5’ end of cox <dig>  and rrnl were the most conserved .figure  <dig>

phylogenies
phylogenetic relationships inferred by bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood  methods were congruent and strongly supported , across each ps and substitution models for each of the three datasets . concerning family-level relationships, the topology is concordant with a recent study  <cit> , in which the family hesperiidae  is subsumed within papilionoidea, and the family papilionidae is the sister clade of the remaining butterflies. at the subfamily level within nymphalidae, ten sampled subfamilies were also well supported. calinaginae and charaxinae grouped with satyrinae . apaturinae and nymphalinae was a sister group and most closely related to the clade comprising heliconiinae and limenitidinae. danainae was the sister of the remaining nymphalid subfamilies. however, the phylogenetic positions of pseudergolinae and libytheinae were not stable among the  <dig> different pss . libytheinae was placed as the sister of all nymphalids except danainae, or as sister to a clade composed of pseudergolinae, apaturinae, nymphalinae, heliconiinae, and limenitidinae . pseudergolinae showed a sister relationship to the clade that included apaturinae, nymphalidae, heliconiinae, and limenitidinae, but also showed a relationship to the clade composed of apaturinae and nymphalidae only.figure  <dig>

tribal-level relationships within nymphalidae were well supported . according to our sampling focus on the subfamily limenitidinae, four tribes were highly supported by different pss . the tribe parthenini was sister to a clade in which neptini was sister to the group composed of adoliadini + limenitidini. although the species bhagadatta austenia has been classified within the tribe limenitidini  <cit> , our data showed this species always grouped with neptini with high support. within limenitidini, a previous study indicated that the genus athyma was paraphyletic  <cit> . our analyses provided strong supports at nodes, indicating that athyma is an artificial group.

although our taxon sampling is limited, some well-supported relationships were also found in other subfamilies. within the subfamily heliconiinae, the tribe argynnini was sister to the clade composed of acraeini + heliconiini  <cit> . within the subfamily nymphalinae, the three tribes kallimini, junoniini and melitaeini formed a clade with strong support. melitaeini, embedded within the subfamily nymphalinae, in concordance with the result of wahlberg et al.  <cit> ; however, the ml bootstrap value is too low to support kallimini as sister to the clade comprising junoniini and melitaeini.

the topologies inferred by parsimony  were different from the bi and ml trees at family and subfamily levels . all three datasets showed the same higher-level  relationships, however, there was some incongruence at species level. a total of  <dig> most parsimonious trees were found for the 37-gene dataset, seven for the 15-gene dataset, and two for the 13-gene dataset. two major inconsistences were found when compared with the likelihood topologies at family level  hesperiidae was placed as sister to four sampled butterfly families, and  a sister group relationship was found between lycaenidae and pieridae. the latter relationship was also found in the most recent analysis using mp  <cit> , but these morphologically implausible family-level relationships had lower bootstrap values in mp analyses than in the ml and bi analyses. at subfamily level within nymphalidae, danainae was also found to be sister to the other nymphalids. other subfamilies had similar relationships to those inferred by ml and bi, except for an unexpected result that libytheinae and pseudergolinae grouped together and were placed sister to other nymphalids.figure  <dig>

a total  <dig> individual single-gene phylogenies were inferred and none recovered the topologies generated using the whole mitogenomic alignment .

bayes factors
bayes factors for the  <dig> pss are shown in table  <dig>  our results show that partitioned datasets are strongly preferred over non-partitioned ones , and more partitioning is preferred over less. one exception is that codon partitioning  performed better than gene partitioning . comparing the marginal likelihood values by two different model settings , most of the bayes factor results showed that the datasets based on the best-fit models had better performance than those based on the gtr + g model. only the most highly partitioned strategy  was preferred over the same strategies using the best-fit substitution model.table  <dig>

the effect of data size and partitioning strategies on tree uncertainty
the summary of credible sets of bayesian trees, treated by different pss and substitution models, is presented in table  <dig>  the results show that the number of trees increases with increasing data partitioning among the  <dig> pss. the number of credible trees produced from  <dig> single-gene datasets is two orders of magnitude greater than that from  <dig> ps datasets, indicating that  <dig> ps datasets had sufficient information to decrease tree uncertainty.table  <dig>

discussion
mitogenomes in butterfly systematics
our results show that mitochondrial gene length and order are conserved among  <dig> sampled lepidopteran mitogenomes, and that the 37-gene aligned matrix includes over 36% parsimony-informative sites. based on this genetic variation, our bi and ml analyses all show strong support for relationships at different hierarchical levels . this strong congruence is not only supported with the most recent phylogenetic studies of butterflies at family and subfamily-level  <cit> , but is also concordant with other mitogenomic phylogenies  <cit> . though taxon sampling is limited across butterfly families in our mitogenomic analyses, this study demonstrates that the entire mitogenome constitutes a particularly efficient marker for studying the phylogeny of butterflies as well as other groups of insects .

encouragingly, our mitogenomic phylogenies provide an insight into deep-level relationships of nymphalidae. at subfamily level, danainae is placed as sister to the remaining nymphalids . however, this outcome is both inconsistent with a morphologically-based study  <cit>  and with the most comprehensive taxa-sampling study of nymphalidae  <cit> , in which libytheinae emerges as sister to the other nymphalids. it should be noticed that the new position of libytheinae  substantially alters the interpretation of the deep evolutionary history of nymphalidae. libytheinae has distinct morphologies compared to other nymphalids   <cit> , and it has well-preserved late eocene fossils, important for calibrating the dating scheme of butterflies  <cit> . as well as being supported in previous mitogenomic studies  <cit> , this mitogenome-suggested position for both danainae and libytheinae may reflect important rather than conflicting signal in the mitogenomic data and merits further attention including recalibration as necessary.

for the “satyroid” assemblage of subfamilies, mitogenomic phylogenies provide strong support within these three subfamily-level topologies across  <dig> pss . these results indicate that the mitogenome might be a potential marker to re-investigate a long-standing phylogenetic question within the subfamily satyrinae  <cit> , for which deep-level relationships, across the clades of elymniini, zetherini, satyrini, dirini, melanitini, haeterini, and morphini, remain controversial. though our sampling is limited for the large subfamily satyrinae, the tribe satyrini was monophyletic with respect to melanitini with strong support, while ypthimina  was sister to the clade composed of satyrina  and lethina .

as for relationships within the subfamily limenitidinae, the four tribes were all monophyletic and well-supported . the tribal relationships are clearly resolved by the bi method, though ml bootstrap shows lower support for the clade comprising adoliadini + limenitidini, indicating that taxon sampling might still not be sufficient. at least, we can confirm that bhagadatta is a neptini and within the limenitidini, the genus athyma is polyphyletic and in need of taxonomic revision. we also note that further work is needed according to these phylogenetic results to illuminate mimetic and evolutionary processes of asian limenitidini butterflies in detail.

some conflicting relationships are found when comparing our results to phylogenetic studies of papilionidae  <cit> . the subfamilies of parnassiinae and papilioninae are sister groups, and four papilioninae tribes are clearly recognised  <cit> . however, our results show parnassius bremeri did not group with other parnassiinae members; instead, this species grouped with the tribe papilionini . we checked its identification via ncbi and bold databases , and this taxon clusters within parnassius phoebe, showing consistency with parnassius. this lack of nesting within parnassiinae merits further examination, but we note that the tribal relationships of parnassiinae are not strongly supported so far  <cit> . moreover, our topology suggests that long-branch attraction has occurred in our mitogenomic phylogenies. in papilionidae, the tribe teinopalpini is regarded as the sister group of papilionini + troidini  <cit> , but our result unexpectedly showed a sister relationship of teinopalpini + troidini as in other mitogenomic studies  <cit> . these conflicting relationships might be caused by inadequate taxon sampling in our study, but we strongly suspect that the public papilionid mitogenomes in particular require detailed validation and/or resequencing. in nymphalidae, the subfamily pseudergolinae had low nodal support in our inferred topologies, yet its position was highly supported by wahlberg et al.  <cit>  , indicating that greater taxon sampling is important to resolve such equivocal relationships  <cit> . further studies should add the subfamilies biblidinae and cyrestinae to clarify this point.

utility of mitogenomic data in lepidoptera
higher level phylogenetic relationships of lepidoptera have been studied and revised based largely on increasing numbers of nuclear genes, recently using the rnaseq approach  <cit> . however, some relationships are still conflicting due to limited taxon sampling  or missing sequences. similar conflicts are found when the studies focus on a subset of taxa  <cit> . we agree that nuclear genes are useful for inferring deep-level lepidopteran relationships, but it is a technological and financial challenge to obtain a huge dataset composed of several nuclear genes from many species and a serious computing challenge to analyse them. instead, our study has demonstrated that it is much easier to obtain a large number of mitogenomes via ngs technologies, and the need for filling with sanger sequencing will further reduce as technologies and coverage improves. to infer molecular phylogenies in lepidoptera, we suggest using mitogenomic sequences to infer phylogeny as a first step, following by more nuclear genes as a second step to obtain highly stable relationships based on unlinked gene histories.

mitochondrial genes have a mutation rate an order of magnitude faster than nuclear dna  <cit> , and these sequences are thus susceptible to phylogenetic noise and long-branch attraction in insects  <cit> . even inference of deep-level relationships based on one or two mitochondrial genes shows much inferior results than that based on a handful of nuclear genes. this is why mitochondrial sequences have not historically been favoured in phylogenetic reconstruction. this viewpoint is misconceived. obviously, phylogenetic results inferred from one or two genes cannot represent the phylogenetic utility of informative snps across whole mitogenomes. comparing topologies inferred from the  <dig>   <dig>  and 37-gene datasets, phylogenies inferred from individual genes do not even recover the same subfamily and tribal-level relationships . it is apparent that single mitochondrial genes simply do not have enough information to infer relationships at this level, even though they include slow-evolving sites whose character changes support some deeper nodes. for investigating deep-level relationships, cameron  <cit>  points out that gene annotation of insect mitogenomes also provides useful information to reveal the evolution of insect mitogenomes. in lepidoptera, the gene order of trnm-trni-trnq is considered a derived character, and only one study has addressed the ancestral gene arrangement found in hepialidae  <cit> , while one study has found that the atp <dig> and atp <dig> genes are absent between the cox <dig> and cox <dig> genes due to gene rearrangement in the species, rohana parisatis   <cit> . our  <dig> sampled mitogenomes all reveal the derived gene order, indicating that this genome rearrangement is conserved in most lepidoptera. any new gene annotations observed in lepidoptera will be diagnostic characters for phylogenetic inference.

the effects of model selection and data partitioning in model-based analyses
the current approaches to reconstructing phylogenies emphasise the selection of proper substitution models and partitioning methods  <cit> . although gene or codon partitioning is the appropriate method for analysing protein coding genes  <cit> , the best-fit partitioning method is still under debate. it is evident from our sliding-window result  that snps were not uniformly distributed by gene region. nevertheless, our results suggest that different partitioning strategies should always be adopted to evaluate the effect of partitioning on phylogenetic topology. in our case, the strategy with the most intense partitioning  is favoured by the bayes factors, even though all the topologies were independent of datasets with different lengths, partitioning schemes and substitution models . we also note that more free parameters  would yield greater topological uncertainty , a pattern consistent with other studies  <cit> .

tree length is the product of substitution rate and time  <cit>  but can be significantly affected by the assumptions of model selection  <cit> . in our case, the bayes factors showed that phylogenies based on the best-fit model  have better performance , and these results confirm that although the mitochondrion evolves as a single gene because of maternal inheritance, dataset partitioning and model selecting are both important treatments to evaluate the phylogeny.

ngs and sanger sequencing methods for mitogenomes
for the purpose of obtaining large numbers of long sequences, the ngs method has clear economic advantages over sanger sequencing  <cit> . the greatest benefit of ngs is to obtain massive quantities of sequence without primer design. although the ngs method has error rates of  <dig> -1%  <cit> , high sequence coverage largely compensates for base errors. ngs methods are also very effective when target mtdnas are rare and highly degenerated  <cit> . as shown by recent advanced studies  <cit>  and our work, the 454-pyrosequencing method using less than a quarter of a  <dig> titanium run  can recover over 85% target regions for a goal of obtaining near  <dig> mitogenomic sequences . in our analyses, regions which cannot be pyrosequenced are often concentrated near the control region or in noncoding regions between the cox <dig> and nad <dig> genes . these gaps can easily be compensated by sanger sequencing. moreover, we emphasise that using the unique-tag method  <cit>  multiplexing reads can more easily be divided to avoid chimaeric mitogenomes and to accelerate bioinformatic processing. similarly, timmermans et al.  <cit>  report an efficient option of combining high sequence coverage by ngs with sanger sequences which are used to bait the pyrosequencing-contigs.

in contrast to the ngs method, sanger sequencing is more economic when the main purpose is to sequence one or a small set of mitogenomes due to their limited length . for example, our designed primers were largely based on conserved regions in  <dig> butterfly mitogenomes . these primers could be used to sequence mitogenomes from other species of nymphalids. the data processing for sanger-derived sequences requires less training in bioinformatics. overall, each sequencing technology has its own advantages and is mutually complementary for maximising the efficiency of high quality sequence retrieval. we recommend first the application of ngs to recover a large proportion of the mitogenome, followed by sanger sequencing as a complementary approach to obtain sequences for regions with low coverage, gaps or high ambiguity, or tag baits.

CONCLUSIONS
this study aimed to obtain a large number of lepidoptera mitogenomes simultaneously via ngs methods. the matrix of  <dig> newly obtained mitogenomes together with  <dig> others deposited in genbank yields a well-supported phylogeny of the superfamily papilionoidea and its subsets, suggesting that the entire mitogenome provides an excellent marker for studying the phylogeny of butterflies and other insect relationships. our newly designed primers based on  <dig> nymphalids also provide a basis for sequencing additional butterfly mitogenomes by the sanger method, while we anticipate that pyrosequencing will become prevalent for mitogenomic studies. we emphasise the need for good quality control or resequencing of existing public sequences, to avoid topological artefacts.
