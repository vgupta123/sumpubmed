BACKGROUND
speech perception requires the recognition and discrimination of phonemes, in particular the encoding of temporal information in short linguistic elements such as consonants and vowels. a main feature to categorize stop-consonants is the voice onset time , which is defined as the duration of the delay between release of closure and start of voicing. it characterizes voicing differences in a variety of languages and distinguishes voiced stop consonants  from their voiceless counterparts   <cit> . discriminating voiced and unvoiced syllables in a consonant–vowel -vot continuum is categorical by exhibiting two qualitatively discrete percepts. the neuronal activity of the auditory cortices during the processing of different vot’s in speech stimuli is reflected by the p50-n <dig> complex of the auditory evoked potential  . accordingly, the p50-n <dig> complex has been successfully shown to reflect neural representation of feature processing of the acoustic stimulus  <cit> .

speech related disorders have been associated with altered acoustic processing abilities. children with general language-learning disabilities  <cit>  and children and adults with dyslexia  <cit>  show an impaired auditory processing of temporal information during speech perception. specifically, these patients demonstrated deficient phoneme perception abilities, reflected by inconsistent labeling of cv-syllables in a vot continuum .

as a completion to conventional approaches that treat temporal processing deficits in dyslexics by perceptual training , transcranial direct current stimulation  might be a promising therapeutic tool. during tdcs low currents are delivered to the cerebral cortex resulting in a modulation of cortical excitability  <cit> . the current flows between an active and a reference electrode through the skull to the brain tissue, thereby inducing diminutions or enhancements of cortical excitability  <cit> . the direction of the tdcs-induced effect depends on the current polarity. anodal tdcs typically increases and cathodal tdcs decreases the cortical excitability in the region under the electrode.

given the neuromodulatory potential of tdcs to alter auditory cortex  reactivity  <cit>  as well as spectro-temporal perception , in the present study, we investigated the effects of tdcs over the bilateral temporal cortex on phonetic categorization of cv-syllables in a vot continuum. we hypothesized tdcs-dependent alterations in the performance of a phonetic categorization task. furthermore, we recorded and compared aeps in response to voiced and voiceless cv-syllables after tdcs application and expect tdcs induced changes in the neuronal reactivity of the ac reflected by modulations of the p50-n <dig> complex.

discussion
in the present study we demonstrate that phonetic perception can be modulated by bilateral tdcs of the ac. categorization of cv-syllables in a vot continuum was enhanced by cathodal tdc-stimulation. in particular, concurrent cathodal tdcs steepened the slope of the identification curve indicating more consistent categorization of the syllables/ta/and/da/. this sharpening of the phonetic perception was accompanied by increased p <dig> amplitude in response to natural cv syllables after anodal stimulation.

in our study, cathodal tdcs improved preciseness of phonetic categorization, with no influences of anodal tdcs. in a first attempt this result might be contradictive in the light of the polarity-specific dichotomy assuming that anodal tdcs typically improves while cathodal tdcs worsens the behavioral outcome in a specific task. notably, these dual-polarity effects have mainly been demonstrated in the motor domain but less on cognitive functions  <cit> . particularly in the auditory domain, several studies demonstrated a decrement of performance induced by cathodal tdcs on auditory function  <cit> , but there is also evidence for an opposite effect showing improved performance after cathodal stimulation  <cit> . it can be assumed that different stimulation parameter such as stimulation power, electrode size, and electrode placement especially of the reference electrode, as well as the individual auditory stimuli contribute to the varying tdcs-effects. furthermore, the tdcs-related alterations of the neurotransmitter level may impact homeostatic plasticity in the auditory domain. whereas anodal tdcs reduces local concentrations of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid , thus, inducing improvement, cathodal tdcs reduces excitatory glutamate levels followed by impoverishment of the behavioral outcome. however, there is also evidence that cathodal tdcs can decrease gaba concentration and thus may induce improved performance as well  <cit> . thus, given that regional cortical excitation/inhibition balance, measured by ratios of glutamate/gaba, provide meaningful interpretations of individual cognitive as well as perceptual performance  <cit> , cathodal tdcs may artificially change the excitation/inhibition balance towards a more optimal level in the auditory cortex.

the present results extend the view of tdcs induced modulations on temporal processing by showing improved phonetic categorization of cv-syllables with varying vots. this might reflect a facilitation of low-level acoustic processing of temporal features in the ac. moreover, we assessed the electrophysiological brain activity in order to investigate tdcs induced after effects on cv-syllable perception. it has been proposed that anodal tdcs over the temporal cortex can alter ac reactivity resulting in modulation of the aeps. as has been demonstrated previously using sinus tones  <cit> , we found enhanced p <dig> amplitudes after unilateral anodal tdcs indicating that alterations in the ac reactivity impact early stages of perceptual processing. basically, the p <dig> component of the aep presumably reflects sensory representation of an acoustic stimulus in the ac  <cit> . accordingly, uni- as well as bilateral anodal tdcs over the ac increases p <dig> amplitudes to acoustic stimuli indicating a general neuromodulatory effect on early sensory acoustic processing. remarkably, the present study shows enhancement of the ac reactivity after anodal- but not cathodal tdcs. such anodal tdcs-related increase in cortical excitation could be assumed to be the cause of an improved auditory performance. however, our behavioral data during tdcs showed no change of performance during anodal condition. accordingly, we cannot directly relate the observed electrophysiological modulations after tdcs to the improved auditory phonetic categorization abilities described with concurrent stimulation. however, tdcs efficiency on cortical excitability critically depends on the timing of the stimulation. several studies showed that tdcs can result in contradictive effects during  and after the application of tdcs . for instance, simultaneous anodal tdcs leads to an improvement in motor learning and working memory performance, whereas during the after-effect anodal tdcs results in no or opposite effects . such opposite online vs. offline effects have been found for the visual domain showing improved perceptual learning after but not during cathodal tdcs  <cit> . analogously, online tdcs decreased motor learning, whereas motor performance was worsened during the after-effect  <cit> . these opposing effects might be related to the underlying physiological actions of online vs. offline tdcs. while acute-effects during stimulation  are primary based on changed membrane potentials, post-stimulation after-effects are related to nmda-receptor activation indicating a ltp-like mechanism for learning . consequently, these differential underlying physiological actions during and after stimulation may lead to opposite effects of tdcs. one might further speculate that bilateral tdcs application over the ac might influence the mutual inhibition between the two hemispheres and thereby inducing opposite effects. moreover, contradictive results might be also related to the different auditory stimuli used during and after tdcs application. while subjects heard ambiguous syllables from the vot continuum, during eeg-recording non-ambiguous syllables were presented.

our results demonstrate that simultaneous cathodal tdcs can induce an enhancement of auditory performance, whereas anodal tdcs induces after-effects that enhance ac reactivity.

nevertheless, the present findings may have clinical implications for the treatment of speech-related pathologies such as dyslexia. dyslectic children as well as adults exhibit deficits in the processing of rapid auditory information accompanied with deficient phonological processing  <cit> . those patients may benefit from tdcs administration as add-on to conventional therapy. notwithstanding the fact that the neurophysiological mechanisms are still not fully understood the current results show that tdcs can be successfully used to modulate rapid temporal processing of speech sounds. consequently, by modulating the excitability of the temporal cortex via non-invasive brain stimulation, the present study provides a novel approach that can be simply administered to address stunted temporal processing abilities in auditory disorders in the human brain.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this is the first study investigating tdcs effects on phonetic perception by behavioral and electrophysiological parameter. our results show that bilateral tdcs of the temporal lobe can change the cortical reactivity and the performance associated with phonetic categorization. additional studies are needed to provide a better understanding of the behavioral and neurophysiological basis of tdcs efficiency in the human ac.
