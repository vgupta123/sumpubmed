BACKGROUND
vibrio cholerae is the etiological agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera. it has caused seven pandemics since  <dig>  the seventh pandemic, which began in  <dig>  was triggered by biotype el tor, serogroup o <dig>  in  <dig>  a new serogroup, o <dig>  appeared, challenging the common belief that only strains of the o <dig> serogroup could cause epidemics  <cit> . epidemics of cholera caused by o <dig> and o <dig> v. cholerae are still a major public health problem in most developing countries. in addition to the known cholera toxin and colonization factors of v. cholerae, many other factors contribute to the pathogenicity of this organism, including hemolysin, rtx toxin, and adaptive response systems  <cit> . the environmental survival ability of this microorganism, which has two life cycles, is very important. climate and environmental changes, including temperature of the aquatic environment  <cit>  and seasonal algal blooms  <cit> , have been confirmed to be related to the persistence and outbreak of cholera in human populations  <cit> .

in addition to the well-studied virulence factors, melanin has also been linked with pathogenicity and virulence in a variety of pathogenic microbes, including cryptococcus neoformans, azotobacter chroococcum, group b streptococcus, and burkholderia cepacia  <cit> , and its catabolic pathway has became an important herbicide target in plants  <cit> . melanin is the most widely distributed protective pigment in the biosphere and its production is thought to be of great significance  <cit> . considerable interest has been shown in melanin, apart from its association with severe human diseases. melanin is believed to contribute to microbial virulence and provides a survival advantage by increasing a pathogen's tolerance to enzymatic degradation, radiation , heavy metals, and adverse temperatures ; by reducing a pathogen's susceptibility to killing through host antimicrobial mechanisms; and by interfering with the host immune response to infection  <cit> . for v. cholerae, it has been reported that mutants induced by chemical reagents or natural isolates subjected to stress, particularly hyperosmotic shock and elevated temperature, can produce brown pigment  <cit> . melanogenesis also has a specific function with respect to the survival of v. cholerae in its natural habitats  <cit> . a further study has shown that melanin pigment formation can enhance the viability of v. cholerae strains in terms of uv resistance, the production of major virulent factors, and colonization, and that mutants of v. cholerae that produce large amounts of melanin are more virulent than their non-melanogenic parental strain  <cit> .

in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, melanin pigment is produced  <cit>  from homogentisate, which is the main p-diphenolic intermediate of normal l-tyrosine catabolism. after its formation through this pathway, the aromatic ring undergoes an oxidative cleavage to yield maleylacetoacetate, which is cis:trans isomerized to fumarylacetoacetate, and this compound is finally split into fumarate and acetoacetate. the enzymes involved in this pathway are, successively, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase , homogentisate oxygenase , maleylacetoacetate isomerase , and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase . it is known that disruption of the balance between the first two enzymes in this sequence can cause homogentisate accumulation, and leads to its spontaneous oxidation and the production of the so-called pyomelanins  <cit> . v. cholerae has been proposed to be a useful prokaryotic model of alterations in l-tyrosine catabolism and has been used to study the molecular basis of diseases related to l-tyrosine catabolism  <cit> . however, to date, all the research on melanogenesis in v. cholerae has been based on chemically induced mutants or mutants generated using transposons.

during our cholera surveillance, some o <dig> and o <dig> strains that produced soluble brown pigments were isolated from environmental water samples and patients. unusually, these strains can produce pigment under the normally used experimental growth conditions . using transposon mutagenesis, we determined that the p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  in the tyrosine catabolic pathway was responsible for the pigment production in these strains  <cit> . further, the three genes in a cluster downstream of vc <dig> were found to correspond to the other three enzymes involved in tyrosine catabolism  <cit> . in this study, we analyzed the sequence variance of the four genes involved in tyrosine catabolism and the functions of the mutant genes to determine the possible mechanism of pigment production in these isolates. we also found a close relationship of clonality among these strains, even though they were isolated in different years and from different areas. the potentiality of clone selection and pathogenicity of such strains should be considered.

 <dig>  methods
 <dig>  strains
in this study,  <dig> v. cholerae o <dig> and o <dig> toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains were used . among these isolates, 95- <dig>  98- <dig>  jx <dig>  jx <dig>  jx <dig>  gd <dig>  and  <dig> are pigment-producing strains. these strains were isolated in different years and from different provinces of china. the el tor strain  <dig> was isolated from patients and the other six o <dig> strains were isolated from environmental water. in addition to the reference strains, including n <dig>  569b, and mo <dig>  the controls included other non-pigment-producing strains that were isolated in the same province or at the same time as the pigmented strains. strains were cultured in lb liquid medium shaking at 37°c or on lb agar plates .

* provinces are presented when the strain is from china.

 <dig>  pcr and sequencing
four genes of vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  and vc <dig>  were amplified using the primer pairs listed in table  <dig> . the pcr products were purified and sequenced. sequence alignments and comparisons were performed using the clustal x program .

reverse transcription pcr was used to detect if these four genes were transcribed together. total rna of strains n <dig> and 95- <dig> was extracted using an rneasy mini kit , transcribed to cdna and used as templates. four pairs of primers designed within of the orf of each gene, rt- <dig>  rt- <dig>  rt- <dig> and rt- <dig> , and three pairs of primers spanning the intervals between these four genes, rt-1344- <dig>  rt-1345- <dig>  and rt-1346- <dig> , were used in the amplification. the total mrna without reverse transcription were used as negative control,

 <dig>  filling in of the 15-bp gap in the vc <dig> gene
two pairs of primers were used to amplify the upstream and downstream fragment of the 15-bp gap in the vc <dig> gene of pigment-producing strain 95- <dig>  the primers were as follows: 1345:1u, 1345:525l, 1345:555u and 1345:1122l . the 5' end of primer 1345:525l overlapped with 1345:555u and contained the 15-bp gap sequence. apart from the 15-bp gap sequence, the pcr product has the same sequence as the wild-type vc <dig> gene of 95- <dig>  the pcr fragment was then cloned into the ncoi enzyme site of the expression vector pet15b  and transformed into wild-type strain 95- <dig>  the original vc <dig> gene of 95- <dig> was also amplified and cloned into pet15b, then transformed into 95- <dig> as a control.

 <dig>  ribotyping
chromosomal dnas of the test strains were extracted and digested with the enzyme bgli. dna fragments were separated and transferred to nylon membranes. the membranes were prehybridized at 42°c for  <dig> h in hybridization solution without probe  and then hybridized with the freshly denatured labeled gene probes at 42°c for  <dig> h. hybridized membranes were washed twice in 2× ssc- <dig> % sds for  <dig> min at room temperature, followed by two washes in  <dig> × ssc- <dig> % sds for  <dig> min at 68°c. the probe used in this typing was the pcr product of the conserved 16s rrna gene of escherichia coli, which was amplified by primers 5'-ttt aat gac cag cac agt-3' and 5'-tct gcc agt gtt aca acc-3', and was labeled using a random primer dig dna labeling and detection kit . detection was based on digoxigenin-anti digoxigenin elisa, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

 <dig>  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
the pfge protocol used was based on the pulsenet 1-day standardized pfge protocol for v. cholerae  <cit> . the cell suspension in a polystyrene tube  was adjusted to an optical density of  <dig> - <dig>  using biomerieux densimat; v. cholerae slices were digested with  <dig> u per slice noti  for  <dig> h at 37°c. electrophoresis was performed using a chef-driii system . images were captured using a gel doc  <dig> system  and converted to tiff files for computer analysis. the bionumerics software package  was used to analyze the pfge patterns. fragments smaller than  <dig>  kbp were not taken into account. similarity analysis was performed by calculating dice coefficients , with customized tolerance for each ep. sd was calculated as follows:  

where nxy is the number of bands common to isolates x and y, nx is the total number of bands for isolate x, and ny is the total number of bands for isolate y. the tolerance was determined according to the value when all the patterns obtained with the same ep were defined to be indistinguishable. clustering was created using the unweighted-pair group method using average linkages .

 <dig>  nucleotide sequence accession numbers
the genbank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences determined in this study are as follows: vc <dig>  gu <dig> to gu930308; vc <dig>  gu <dig> to gu942519; vc <dig>  gu <dig> to gu942541; and vc <dig>  gu <dig> to gu <dig>

RESULTS
 <dig>  sequence variation in the vc <dig> to vc <dig> gene cluster
in most cases, the chromosomal location of the hpd gene is next to other genes with no functional relationships; however, in v. cholerae, this gene is linked to the other genes involved in tyrosine metabolism, which were annotated as products of vc <dig> to vc <dig>  <cit> . using the total mrna of n <dig> and 95- <dig> cultures as templates, reverse transcription pcr showed that all the three intervals of these four genes were amplified , whereas the total mrna without reverse transcription  were negative, which indicated that vc <dig> to vc <dig> were transcribed as a single primary rna and thereby constituted an operon in v. cholerae.

the four genes vc <dig> to vc <dig> of the  <dig> strains listed in table  <dig> were sequenced. each gene and the predicted proteins with the number of the mutant sites, and the frequencies of mutation are shown in figure  <dig>  these results show that the four genes within a single operon exhibit different levels of variation. vc <dig> is the most conserved and vc <dig> has the highest variance, with mutation rates of  <dig> % and  <dig> % at the nucleotide level, respectively. this difference in mutation rate was also evident in the non-pigment-producing strains . although the vc <dig> gene has  <dig> mutant sites in its nucleic acid sequence, only one mutant residue was found in its amino acid sequence at position  <dig>  which is either ala or val. this one residue substitution does not cause polar or acid-alkaline change. on the basis of this amino acid residue difference, the test strains can be divided into two groups. strains in the val <dig> group include o <dig>  and o <dig> strains, whereas all of the strains in the ala <dig> group belong to serogroup o <dig>  including all six of the o <dig> pigment-producing strains. because non-pigment-producing strains are also placed in this group, it can be presumed that this genotype is unrelated to pigment production. moreover, none of the mutant sites found in the vc <dig> and vc <dig> genes were consistently present in genomes of the pigment-producing strains.

among the pigment-producing strains, sequences of the four genes in the o <dig> strain  <dig> were the same as those in n16961; the exception being vc <dig>  in which a 10-bp sequence was missing between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig>  this caused a frameshift mutation and complete change in its protein sequence . among the six o <dig> pigment-producing strains, the sequences of the four genes were almost identical, with the exception of four nucleotide differences: in the vc <dig> gene, c <dig> in jx <dig>  and a <dig> in jx <dig> and 95-4; and in the vc <dig> gene, a <dig> in 98- <dig>  because of the high similarity identified in the cluster analysis of these four genes, all of the six pigment-producing strains could be grouped into one cluster, and, with the exception of the vc <dig> gene, none of the non-pigment-producing strains was included in the clusters of the pigment-producing strains . in vc <dig>  a 15-bp fragment deletion, from nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig>  was found in all six of the o <dig> pigment-producing strains, suggesting that this deletion mutation may be correlated with their pigment phenotype. in the borders of the deletion region, a short direct repeat  was found .

 <dig>  functional complementation of the vc <dig> gene of strain 95-4
using overlap pcr , we obtained the fragment which contain the complementary  <dig> nt which is absent in the wild pigment production strain 95- <dig>  corresponding to the filling in the 15-bp gap in the vc <dig> and retained the remainder of the gene sequence as in the pigment production wild-type. we then cloned this fragment containing backbone of the wild-type vc <dig> gene of strain 95- <dig> and the  <dig> nt filling, into the expression vector pet15b and this recombinant plasmid was transformed into the wild-type 95- <dig> strain. this gene was expressed with induction of iptg. after trans-complementation, strain 95- <dig> with the plasmid carrying the  <dig> nt filling of vc <dig> gene no longer produced pigment, whereas the control strain 95- <dig> containing its own vc <dig> gene cloned in pet15b showed no change in its pigment producing ability. this therefore showed that providing hgo enzyme is sufficient to avoid the pigment production and filling in of the 15-bp gap is sufficient to recover vc <dig> gene function.

 <dig>  clonality of the pigment-producing strains
the pigment-producing strains, particularly those in serogroup o <dig>  have the same mutation in the hpd gene; however, these strains were isolated in different years and from different areas. to explore the clonal relationships among these strains and the other strains, we used molecular typing methods to compare the strains at the genome level. in the pfge analysis, the patterns of the six o <dig> pigment-producing strains were compared with the other nontoxigenic o <dig> strains in our v. cholerae pfge database, which covers the o <dig> strains isolated in china from  <dig> and the o <dig> strains isolated from  <dig>  the cluster analysis  showed that all of the  <dig> pigment-producing strains could be grouped together and separated from other non-pigment-producing strains, including some strains isolated in the same year and from the same province as the pigment-producing strains. strain  <dig> was not included in the pfge analysis since it has an o <dig> serogroup.

previously, we analyzed the ribotyping polymorphism of o <dig> isolates collected since o <dig> cholera appeared in china  <cit> . here, we also determined the ribotypes of these pigment-producing strains. hybridization showed that all of the o <dig> pigment-producing strains had the same ribotype, which was the same as the rb <dig> type identified in our previous study. the el tor strain  <dig> has a similar pattern to the toxigenic strain n <dig> 

 <dig>  discussion
many environmental microbes produce melanins, and melanin pigments are also an inherent phenotype of a broad range of eukaryotic microorganisms. the melanin in these strains may confer resistance to unfavorable environmental factors, host immunity, and even play a role in virulence expression. therefore, melanin may confer a survival advantage on these natural pigment-producing v. cholerae strains in the estuary niche, and pathogenicity in the host.

previously, v. cholerae strains with a pigmented phenotype were induced under stress or by chemical mutagenesis. in this study, we describe certain o <dig> and o <dig> isolates that can produce pigment under normal experimental growth conditions. though the mutations in these o <dig> and o <dig> pigment-producing strains are different, both of them involve the dysfunction of hgo, the product of the vc <dig> gene of v. cholerae. in our study, gene complementation of the mutant vc <dig> confirmed the role of its dysfunction in pigment production. as a consequence, the disruption of the balance between the enzymes encoded by vc <dig> and vc <dig> causes homogentisate accumulation and spontaneous oxidation. the pigment production mechanism in these wild-type strains is same as in the chemically induced pigmented mutants  <cit> .

with the exception of the 10-bp deletion in the vc <dig> gene of the el tor strain  <dig>  which appears to be a random mutation, it is interesting that the same 15-bp deletion in the vc <dig> gene occurs in all the studied o <dig> pigment-producing strains, despite the fact that these strains were isolated over a period spanning the years  <dig> to  <dig>  the deletion boundaries contain short direct repeats; therefore, it is possible that these commonly occurring recombinations gave rise to the mutant strains. it is not clear, however, how the 15-bp fragment affects the activity of the hgo enzyme. in the crystal structure of human hgo  <cit> , the homologous amino acid residues encoded by this  <dig> bp form a small turn in the protein surface. although it is not included in the predicted active sites or the  <dig> missense mutations that have been identified in the hgo from aku patients  <cit> , structural change in this mutant protein could be assumed.

the genes vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  and vc <dig> comprise an operon, and the products of all four genes are predicted to be involved in tyrosine catabolism. the nucleotide and amino acid sequence variations in these genes are, however, inconsistent; vc <dig> is highly conserved, although its nucleotide sequence varies among the different strains, only a single amino acid residue difference is present at the protein level, which suggests that it plays an important role in the tyrosine pathway, and is conserved despite undergoing different stress selections. in contrast, vc <dig> is considerably more variable, and different deletion mutations result in dysfunction of its product. this suggests that the accumulation of homogentisate, and the subsequent melanin production instead of complete decomposition of the amino acid in the routine pathway, may have survival benefits for the mutants in certain specific environments, thus the mutations will be retained. variation and even dysfunction of the vc <dig> product may shift the metabolic production of tyrosine and produce strains that are adapted to surviving in rigorous environments.

it is also interesting that the molecular types of the o <dig> pigment strains are indistinguishable or quite similar, suggesting the high clonality of these strains, even though they were obtained over a span of at least  <dig> years and from different regions. they have the same mutation in the tyrosine metabolism pathway. additionally, compared to the high variance of the vc <dig> to vc <dig> genes, the sequences in all the six o <dig> pigment-producing strains were highly consistent. these data suggest that the o <dig> pigment-producing strains originate from one distinctive clone. the wide distribution of such strains in the environment may suggest their survival advantage. the signature of the 15-bp deletion within the homogentisate  <dig> -dioxygenase gene  in the o <dig> pigmented strains, or the mutation of vc <dig> in the melanin-producing strains of v. cholerae when the el tor biotype is included, is one of the biomarkers for the pigment-producing strains, and may be of significance in biological research and epidemiological tracing.

we observed that the nontoxigenic o <dig> pigment-producing strains exhibited a rb <dig> ribotype. in our previous study, the rb <dig> isolates were cholera toxin gene-negative o <dig> strains, and this ribotype is clearly different from the other patterns of the toxigenic o <dig> strains that are cholera toxin gene positive  <cit> . all of the rb <dig> strains were isolated from patients, and an unknown pathogenic mechanism is presumed  <cit> . though the o <dig> pigment-producing strains examined in this study were isolated from environmental water samples, their possible pathogenicity should not be excluded, particularly since such strains are isolated successively in some years. the study showed that the pigment-producing strain expressed more toxin-coregulated pilus and cholera toxin, by possibly mechanism which pigment production might cause induction of the toxr regulon due to generation of hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . strain  <dig> is the toxigenic strain associated with the seventh pandemic, and it is speculated that this strain is more virulent than other strains on account of its pigment production, based on its role in v. cholerae virulence factor expression  <cit> .

 <dig>  
CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this study we demonstrate that the pigment-producing v. cholerae isolates have mutations in the tyrosine metabolic pathway are highly clonal, and suggest that pigment production may confer a survival advantage to this clone in the environment. the possible contribution of pigment production to v. cholerae pathogenesis of those nontoxigenic o <dig> strains and toxigenic el tor strain in humans is of considerable interest and worthy of further investigation.
