BACKGROUND
aberrant t lymphocyte proliferation is a key mediator of alloimmune activation in organ transplantation. therefore, t cells are the key targets for direct transfer of genes that could inhibit their proliferation and alloimmune activation. a number of strategies using either adenoviral or lentiviral vectors linked to mono or bispecific antibodies directed against t cell surface markers/cytokines did not yield the desired results  <cit> . the efficacy of a cd <dig> promoter-p <dig> chimeric construct to transfer p <dig> gene to t lymphocytes was tested. cyclin kinase inhibitor p <dig> is a potent inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation and inflammation  <cit> . inflammation is realized as one of the key mediators of a number of diseases associated with aberrant cellular proliferation including alloimmune activation and organ transplant rejection.  <cit> . transfer of genes into t cells remains a critical step to achieve successful therapeutic strategies for such diseases. it is also clear that resting t cells, which make up most of the circulating t-cell pool in vivo, cannot be specifically and efficiently transfected due to the presence of other immune cells in the same milieu. the direct adenoviral and lentiviral vectors mediated gene transfer to t cells was not successful and the modification and coupling of these vectors with antibodies to cd <dig> and other t cell surface receptors permitted some limited success  <cit> . interestingly, expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines is increased during t lymphocyte proliferation  <cit> . therefore, an effective control of t cell proliferation by regulating the expression of cyclins would potentially inhibit alloimmune activation and inflammation. cyclin kinase inhibitor p <dig>  is one of the most potent cyclin kinase inhibitor and therefore has potential to control the expression of cyclins and t cell activation. the inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases and cyclins by p <dig> will prevent excessive proliferation and prevent alloimmune activation by the direct inhibition of t lymphocyte proliferation.

at the present time one of the most effective means to inhibit t lymphocyte activation and alloimmune activation is with the immunosuppressive agents; cyclosporine , tacrolimus  and sirolimus . however, the long-term usage of these drugs leads to number of side effects including nephrotoxicity, malignancy and viral infections  <cit> . we have demonstrated that the t cell inhibitory effects of csa, tac and srl are in part mediated by the induction of p <dig>  <cit> . our studies have also demonstrated in vitro and in vivo over-expression of p <dig> in lymphocytes results in decreased response to mitogenic stimuli and greater sensitive to the inhibitory effects of csa  <cit> . we have also shown that the over expression of p <dig> in the recipients of rat heart transplant recipients resulted in increased graft survival via the inhibition of mrna expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in allografts and lymphocytes  <cit> . most significantly, we recently demonstrated that the recombinant p <dig> protein localizes into the nucleus, interacts with transcription factors and inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and markers of inflammation  <cit> .

therefore, the present study was designed to explore in vitro and in vivo gene transfer of p <dig> targeted to t cells using chimeric cd <dig> promoter-p <dig> constructs. for in vitro studies, mouse thyoma cell line el <dig>  which constitutively express t cell growth factor il- <dig> were used. the in vivo effects were evaluated by intramuscularly injecting cd3-p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna in mice. the results demonstrate the feasibility p <dig> gene transfer targeted to t cells with the cd3-p <dig> chimeric constructs with its biological consequences that is modulation of lymphocyte proliferation and alloimmune activation.

RESULTS
cd3sensep <dig> and cd3antisensep <dig> constructs
a diagrammatic presentation of cd3p <dig> chimeric construct with sequences of cd <dig> promoter, enhancer and p <dig> genes in psk plasmid is shown in figure  <dig>  chimeric constructs with p <dig> in the sense and anti-sense orientation are designated as cd3sense p <dig> and cd3antisensep <dig>  respectively.

efficiency of transfection
a) in vitro
transfection efficiency was expressed as the percentage of the total cells in the gated region that displayed green fluorescence, i.e. expressed in the pegfp-p <dig> plasmid. a mean of 76% ±  <dig> el4-il- <dig> cells were found to be positive from three consecutive transfection experiments, compared to completely negative for green fluorescence of untransfected cells.

b) in vivo
intramuscular injection of p21-egfp plasmid dna resulted in increased expression of p <dig> and gfp mrna in splenocytes . the expression of p <dig> mrna was seen in 4/ <dig> mice and gfp mrna in 5/ <dig> mice .

targeted p <dig> overexpression inhibits il- <dig> expression by el <dig> thyoma cell lines
transfection with cd3-p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna in el <dig> thyoma cell lines resulted in modulation of p <dig> gene expression. the results demonstrate that p <dig> mrna expression was observed only in cells transfected with, cd3-p <dig> sense plasmid dna but not in cells transfected with either empty vector  or cd3p <dig> antisense plasmid dna . similar pattern was observed with p <dig> protein expression .

efficacy of the transfection with cd3p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna was assessed by mrna expression of il- <dig> in comparison with cells transfected with empty vector dna. el4-il <dig>  mouse t cells were transfected with dna from either sense or antisense cd3p <dig> constructs using lipofectamine <dig> . after  <dig> h, the cells were harvested, rna was prepared and the expression of il- <dig> was studied by rt-pcr and compared with untreated cells. the results in figure 3c demonstrate that in comparison with empty vector dna transfected cells , the expression of il- <dig> mrna increased in cells transfected with anti-sense  and decreased in el4-il- <dig> cells treated with and sense plasmid dna . the expresion of the house keeping gene β-actin in these cells was identical. interestingly, the cells from cd <dig> antisensep <dig> plasmid dna transfected proliferated more and cd3sensep <dig> plasmid dna transfected proliferated less compared to untreated el4-il <dig> cells. these results demonstrate that it was feasible to modulate p <dig> gene expression in t cell line using cd3p <dig> chimeric constructs. as a control, human adenocarcinoma cells  and aortic smooth muscle cells were also transfected with cd3p <dig> sense plasmid dna and did not result in increased p <dig> expression .

effect of targeted p <dig> modulation on mitogen induced t cell proliferation and t cell growth factor  mrna expression
to study the effect of p <dig> modulation on mitogen induced proliferation of t cells, el4-il- <dig> cells transfected with cd3p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna were activated with mitogen phytohemaglutinin . the proliferation was quantified by 3h-thymidine uptake assay and il- <dig> expression was studied by rt-pcr after treatment of these cells with pha for  <dig> hours. the results shown in figure 4a demonstrate the inability of el4-il <dig> cells transfected with cd3sensep <dig> plasmid dna to proliferate in response to mitogenic stimulus with pha. interestingly, el4il- <dig> cells transfected with cd3antisensep <dig> plasmid dna proliferated significantly  more compared to the empty vector transfected cells. these results indicate the ability of cd3p <dig> chimeric constructs to alter proliferation of mouse t cells, by altering p <dig> expression.

el4il- <dig> cells transfected with either cd3sensep <dig> or cd3antisensep <dig> constructs were treated with pha  for  <dig> hours, rna was isolated and expression of il- <dig> mrna was studied by rt-pcr. the results shown in the figure 4b demonstrate the increase in il- <dig> expression only in el4il <dig> cells transfected with cd3antisensep <dig> plasmid dna. the increased il- <dig> expression correlated with the proliferation of these cells in response to pha.

in vivo efficacy of cd3p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna in mice
 <dig> mice  were divided into three groups . mice were intramuscularly injected with either empty vector plasmid dna, or cd3p <dig> sense or antisense plasmid dna . mice were sacrificed after day  <dig> and splenocytes were prepared and activated with anticd <dig> monoclonal antibody. first, we confirmed the presence of cd <dig> and p <dig> mrna in lymphocytes from mice injected with cd3p <dig> sense or antisense plasmid dna. the results  demonstrate the presence of both cd <dig> and p <dig> mrna in mice injected with cd3sensep <dig> compared to only cd <dig> mrna in mice injected with cd3antisensep <dig> plasmid dna. the results  also indicate that splenocytes from mice transfected with cd3p <dig> mice proliferated significantly  less than controls  and than mice transfected with cd3asp <dig> plasmid dna . the real time pcr analysis of these anti-cd <dig> activated lymphocytes demonstrated a tnf-α  and ifn-γ  increased mrna expression in lymphocytes from cd <dig> antisensep <dig> plasmid dna compared to cd3sensep <dig> plasmid injected mice .

discussion
the principal aim for this chimeric plasmid was to test the t cell targeted overexpression of p <dig> in t lymphocytes, since cd <dig> is surface marker for only t lymphocytes. we have earlier described the efficacy of p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna to either overexpress or delete p <dig> gene in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell lines  <cit> . alloimmune activation remains a critical step in allograft rejection and survival. therefore, a strategy, which could specifically target t lymphocytes, will provide an effective inhibition of alloimmune activation permitting prolonged graft survival. our studies  <cit>  have demonstrated that p <dig> is such an agent since it is a potent inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation. our studies have shown that its over expression not only renders lymphocytes less responsive to mitogenic and allogenic stimuli but also makes them more responsive to other anti-inflammatory agents such as csa  <cit> . our in vitro studies with another t cell line  have also demonstrated that the overexpression of p <dig> resulted in their unresponsiveness to mitogenic stimuli  <cit> . these results demonstrate that p <dig> can be utilized as an effective agent to specifically target t lymphocytes to limit inflammation. interestingly, mcd3delta promoter has been shown contributes largely to a t cell-specific expression pattern both in vitro and in transgenic mouse studies  <cit> , supporting our studies with cd3promoter-p <dig> chimeric gene construct. studies have also demonstrated that adenoviral vectors coupled to bispecific antibodies  with one of the antibodies to cd <dig> could target t cells that were normally resistant to adenoviral vectors. similarly, surface-engineered lentiviral vectors significantly improved transduction of primary lymphocytes by activating the target cells  <cit> . but the results from these experiments explain the ability of a nonviral vector to directly transfer genes to t cell s with cd <dig> promoter gene construct.

a number of studies  <cit>  have explored the efficacy of adenoviral or lentiviral vectors with different combinations of antibodies to mhc- <dig>  t cell receptor -cd3+ cytokine +chemokine to provide gene therapeutic approach for cancer treatment to bypass tumor immune mechanisms. however, in this study, the efficacy of a nonviral cd3p <dig> chimeric plasmid construct to effectively in vivo modulate p <dig> expression is provided. previous studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of p <dig> induced by intramuscular injection of p <dig> sense plasmid dna resulted in an increased graft survival in a rat heart transplant model  <cit> . the method of using plasmid dna to obtain in vitro and in vivo transfection of p <dig> is based on the data supporting the efficacy of intra-muscular injection of plasmid dna for a number of genes  <cit> . intramuscular injection of naked plasmid dna expression vectors encoding either tgf-beta <dig>  or an il-4-igg <dig> chimeric protein  resulted in production of tgf-beta <dig> or il-4-igg <dig>  respectively, and protection from myelin basic protein -induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis   <cit> . the in vivo specificity and efficiency of nonviral vectors has been demonstrated for il- <dig> was found to be far more persistent than those achieved by viral vectors  <cit> . similar results have been reported for a number of genes with a single intramuscular injection suggesting that the muscle tissue is accessible and expression is usually more persistent than elsewhere, vector administration is simple and the method is inexpensive. more significantly, plasmids do not induce neutralizing immunity, which permits repeated administration. one of the earlier criticisms of this methodology was that effect of gene modulation in immune cells might not be achieved but this and other studies  <cit>  more significantly in human  <cit>  demonstrates the feasibility of the gene transfer using plasmid dna. our method of in vitro and in vivo modulation of gene expression was very efficient.

therefore, based on our published studies  <cit>  and the results from this study, we demonstrate that the p <dig> over-expression obtained through direct gene transfer to t cells via intramuscular injections of cd3-p <dig> plasmid dna results in the decreased responsiveness of t lymphocytes to mitogenic stimuli. linearized dna containing the cd3-p <dig> construct was used to overexpress p <dig> both in vitro  and in vivo in mice . these results uniquely describe the construction of a chimeric plasmid construct constituted of cd <dig> promoter and cyclin kinase inhibitor p <dig>  the results demonstrate the feasibility of direct gene transfer to t cells with a cd3promoter-p <dig> chimeric construct.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results from this study uniquely describes the feasibilty of direct gene transfer into t cells with a chimeric cd3-p <dig> plasmid construct. the transfection of el <dig> thymoma cells, which constitutively express il- <dig> mrna, using dna with p <dig> in the sense and antisense direction resulted in modulation of t cell proliferation. the extent of cellular proloferation correlated with il- <dig> mrna expression. most significantly, intramuscular injection of the cd3p <dig> sense and antisense plasmid dna resulted in increased p <dig> expresion in t cells confirmed by the expression of cd <dig> and p <dig> mrna expression. this overexpression resulted in unresponisveness of splenocytes from these mice to mitigen-induced proloferation. however, we did not explore the effect of p <dig> overexpression in subsets of t lymphocytes such as cd <dig> and cd <dig> cells, which may have different response. furthermore, based on its effect on immunomodulation, it is likely that p <dig> plays an important role in genertaion and maintrenance of cd4+cd25+ t regulatoruy cells, which need to be explored. the ultimate goal of such a study is to utilize this methodology to target t cells to modulate gene expression in t cells responsible for site specific inflammation and alloimmune activation. the targeted overexpression of p <dig> in t lymphocytes to inhibit their proliferation and subsequently inflammation will provide the most suitable therapeutic strategy to inhibit alloimmune activstion in organ transplantation. this can only be accompalished using a gene therapeutic technique. using various gene transfer technologies, the ability to transfer genes to the various cell types within whole animals has been describing allowing a wishful thinking to prevent and treat many diseases. it is therefore conceived that that the studies like this would pave the way to the development of such tools not just to treat disease but also to study the physiology of the healthy body. the ability to target tissue specific gene to alter the products  responsible for a specific signaling or biosynthetic pathway, will be extremely beneficial. thouogh these strategies seem possible however many hurdles and challenges that include efficient in vitro and in vivo transfection need to be overcome. but the studies like this if confirmed in a number of other models will provide an unique direction in the development of targeted gene therapeutic approaches to prevent not only only alloimmune activation in organ transplantation but also inflammtion in patients with cancer, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and others diseases associated with aberrant cellular proliferation like atherosclerosis.
