BACKGROUND
in astrocytes of the brain reward area, the nucleus accumbens , γ-hydroxybutyric acid  evoked intracellular store-reliant ca2+ transients, independently of neuronal activity  <cit> . previously, we also showed that binding sites for ghb are shared with citric acid cycle intermediate succinic acid  and the gap-junction blocker carbenoxolone hemisuccinate , as disclosed in nac membrane homogenates isolated from rat and human brain tissues  <cit> . these findings raised the possibility that suc, similarly to ghb may also evoke ca2+ transients in nac astrocytes. further, it is conceivable that the rather specific sensitivity of the suc/ghb target site to cbx might be a sign of its functional association with connexin channels. in order to study the effect and functional significance of suc on the ca2+ homeostasis of nac astrocytes, we considered that the ca2+ bursting activity was found atp-responsive in vivo, i.e. in bergmann glia networks activated by the motor behaviour of the awaken animal  <cit> . therefore, we sought to characterise first the atp-responsive ca2+ signalling amongst the astrocytes of the nac.

atp is known to evoke ca2+ bursts by activation of purinergic g-protein-coupled receptors  in vitro  <cit>  as well as in vivo  <cit> . different in vitro paradigms, including locally administered atp stimuli  were found effective to evoke ca2+ transients  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated if locally ejected atp  could evoke ca2+ bursting in nac astrocytes. measurements were performed by combined application of confocal ca2+ imaging, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology in acute nac tissue slices prepared from the rat brain. astrocytes were identified by co-localization of astrocyte-specific antibodies raised against the astroglial gap-junction protein connexin  <dig>  and the glial fibrillary acidic protein . then, atp-evoked ca2+ bursts have been characterised by using of various drugs and agents, including gap-junction inhibitors , an antibody raised against the gating peptide segment of cx <dig>  purinergic p <dig> receptor agents such as the broad-spectrum p2x and p2y receptor antagonist suramin , p2y <dig> subtype-specific agonist 2-adenosine 5'-diphosphate  and antagonist mrs <dig>  the na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin  and the ca2+ store depleting cyclopiazonic acid . moreover, we also demonstrate for the first time the existence of suc-responsive ca2+ transients that overlay in a sub-population of nac astrocytes.

RESULTS
in selecting the nac region of interest, we first considered area-dependent distribution of cx <dig> protein and its co-localization with gfap. next, we asked if cx43-positive nac astrocytes were responded to local administration of atp by ca2+ transients. subsequently, the hypothesis that suc may also activate ca2+ transients playing part in the atp-responsive ca2+ signals was tested. finally, responsiveness of nac neurons to atp was explored.

demonstration of atp-evoked burst-like ca2+ signals amongst astrocytes in the nac
the expression and distribution of cx <dig> have been first characterised in rat brain sections by immunohistochemistry. the staining pattern in a coronal section of a paraformaldehyde -fixed rat brain revealed intense staining in both the shell and the core regions in the nac . high intensity of cx <dig> immunolabelling was observed in the nac as compared to adjacent brain regions , suggesting a relatively higher level of connectivity of the astrocyte network in the nac through this type of gap-junctions. besides the nac, relatively high cx <dig> immunolabelling was also found in other brain areas, including several viscerosensory and limbic regions: i) medial prefrontal cortex, ii) purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar cortex, iii) hippocampus, particularly the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, iv) central nucleus of the amygdala, v) dorsal subdivision of the lateral septal nucleus, vi) dorsolateral subdivision of the periaqueductal gray, and vii) nucleus of the solitary tract . cx <dig> had a patchy distribution in the nac; that is, areas with high and low intensity of labelling were intermingled . where the labelling of cx <dig> was intense, the vast majority of cx <dig> cells contained astrocyte marker protein gfap immunoreactivity as shown in figure 1c.

in freshly prepared nac slices from 10- <dig> day old male rats,  <dig> μm atp applied locally for  <dig> sec  evoked ca2+ transients, propagating in up to  <dig> cells  in a total of  <dig> slices from  <dig> rats . in order to characterise the dynamics of ca2+ transients, short  and long atp  puffs were compared. the period of repetitive ca2+ transients observed after the application of the short atp-puff  occurred on a time scale similar to that of the bulky ca2+ transient evoked by the long atp-puff . the observation suggested that the bulky ca2+ signal can be decomposed into many repetitive ca2+ transients providing kinetic evidence for a burst-like, coupled ca2+ dynamics. the number of atp responsive astrocytes was significantly higher in the nac compared to the adjacent ventral pallidal area . in line with the cx <dig> expression pattern , the observation conjectured cx43-related atp-responsive ca2+ signalling in the nac. the burst-like ca2+ signal, apparently not influenced by the direction of the perfusion, propagated in round or ellipsoidal waveform at an approximate  <dig> μm/s speed . when monitored by the glial marker dye sr <dig>  <cit> , the diffusion of atp was about  <dig>  times faster than the speed of the ca2+ wave propagation . it is to note, that the dynamics of burst-like ca2+ signals of nac astrocytes can be compared with that of ca2+ bursts of bergmann glia in vivo  <cit> .

molecular dissection of atp-evoked burst-like ca2+ signalling
in the lack of specific gap-junction blocker, we applied an antibody against the gating peptide segment of cx <dig>  <cit>  to inhibit cx <dig> function and therefore to evaluate the involvement of gap-junctions in the atp-evoked burst-like ca2+ signals. few co-localization of ca2+ transients and cx <dig> immunoreactivity was observed when nac slices were pre-incubated with the cx <dig> antibody , suggesting that inhibition of cx <dig> function may preclude cx <dig> immunoreactive astrocytes to participate in the ca2+ signal. in contrast, an about fourfold increase in co-localization of ca2+ transients and cx <dig> immunoreactivity was seen , when the same antibody was applied after the application of atp . this observation indicated that the blockade of the gap-junction could prevent atp from evoking burst-like ca2+ signalling. co-localizations of ca2+ transients with cx <dig>  and those of cx <dig> with gfap  conclusively suggested that the atp-evoked burst-like ca2+ signalling occurred in nac astrocytes.

in order to characterise the molecular determinants of atp-evoked burst-like propagation of ca2+ transients, effects of different gap-junction inhibitors , purinergic p <dig> antagonists , agonist 2-me-s-adp and ca2+ store depleting conditions  were investigated. to start with, the number of cells participating in the first  and the second  atp applications were compared . the changes in the number of atp responsive cells in the presence of the test compounds  were compared to the Δn values obtained for two consecutive atp applications both in the absence of test compounds , and were given as percentage of the first atp application . matching with affinities to those reported for the blockade of intercellular communication through gap junctions  <cit> , atp-evoked ca2+ signalling was significantly inhibited by  <dig> μm and  <dig> mm cbx . ffa applied in  <dig> mm concentration was also found effective . the voltage-gated na+ channel-blocking agent ttx  and the broad spectrum p2x and p2y antagonist sur  were ineffective. however, the atp puff-evoked ca2+ transients were virtually eliminated by the selective p2y <dig> receptor antagonist mrs <dig>  . the observed variability in mrs <dig> effects most probably reflects the receptor/cell heterogeneity in the nac slices prepared from 10- <dig> day old rats. noteworthy, atp only activated mrs2179-sensitive p2y <dig> receptor in the olfactory bulb  <cit> , as well. locally applied p2y <dig> selective agonist 2-me-s-adp  also evoked ca2+ transients in cells loaded with fluo- <dig> acetoxymethyl ester , indicating the involvement of p2y <dig> receptor in ca2+ signalling mechanisms within nac astrocytes . in addition,  <dig> μm mrs <dig> also blocked ca2+ transients evoked by 2-me-s-adp applied as atp . blocking effects of zero-added ca2+ with  or without  the intracellular calcium store depleting cpa  or cpa alone   suggest that the appearance of concerted ca2+ transients stimulated by atp in the nac slice was reliant on the cellular ca2+ stores. ca2+ release from internal stores may also substantiate oscillatory dynamics observed .

in addition to the number of atp-responsive cells, we also analysed the magnitude of the response . maximal df/f <dig> values for individual cells in the absence and presence of the test compounds were determined. the calculated average change in max values were compared to the Δmax values obtained for two consecutive atp applications both in the absence of test compounds , and were given as percentage of the first atp application. this analysis concluded to results consistent with the cell number-based evaluation . the obtained linear correlation between the cell number- and fluorescence intensity-based data  indicates that the ca2+ transients are produced by an on/off trigger, corroborating ca2+ store-operated mechanisms.

suc activates ca2+ transients in nac astrocytes
we tested the hypothesis whether, in addition to atp, suc also activates astroglial ca2+ signals. this was explored in measurements of the effect of suc alone and in combination with the atp puff-evoked ca2+ transients characterized before. to this end, we applied the drug testing protocol described before  enabling the detection of the suc-responsive ca2+ transients before the second atp application. this way, the observation of the suc-responsive cells throughout the second atp made possible comparison of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the suc- and atp puff-evoked ca2+ transients.

indeed, superfusion of suc initiated ca2+ transients in a sub-population of nac astrocytes showing ca2+ transients in response to puffs of atp . apparently, these superimpositions of cells responding to atp and suc were independent of the site of activation . the temporal relationships of suc- and atp-evoked ca2+ transients revealed similar dynamics, as shown by representative df/f <dig> traces . within the same suc-responsive cells, ca2+ transients appeared longer during atp application  conjecturing coincident atp activation. suc evoked single  and repetitive ca2+ transients, being more frequent with higher  . mostly double - but see orange trace in figure 5c from figure 5b images at  <dig> s and  <dig> s - ca2+ transients evoked by  <dig> μm suc were observed in only about 10% of slices. similarity of ca2+ dynamics may suggest that suc-responsive cells could participate in burst-like ca2+ signalling evoked by atp. it can be relevant in this respect that the number of suc-responsive cells did significantly tend to be higher after the atp application .

the change in the number of cells showing suc-evoked ca2+ transients could be characterised by an ec <dig> value of 50- <dig> μm . the same measurements on ca2+ transients, however, provided less Δmax data, the possible reason why the fluorescence intensity-based evaluation of the effective concentration for suc was less conclusive . these findings were at variance with the results of the inhibition of atp puff-evoked ca2+ transients , suggesting that in addition to the oscillatory ca2+ dynamics, suc may also alter fluorescence intensity through some other mechanisms making these data more vulnerable to the threshold criterion applied .

next, we asked if ca2+ transients evoked by suc application were occurred in astrocytes. it has already been demonstrated that the protocol used here for fluo- <dig> am loading preferentially labels astrocytes  <cit> . for further identification of cells displaying suc-responsive ca2+ transients we applied double immunostaining for the glial marker proteins gfap  and cx <dig> . colocalization of cx <dig> and gfap proteins  identified the suc-responsive cells as astrocytes.

neurons within the domain of burst-like ca2+ signalling are not activated
in order to see if neurons in the nac participate in atp-stimulated astroglial ca2+ transients, we filled visually identified cells in either the shell or core regions with ca2+ indicator dyes  hexapotassium salt,  <cit> ). we monitored intracellular ca2+ changes  and postsynaptic currents simultaneously. the cells were identified as neurons by the appearance of voltage activated fast na+ currents during application of a voltage-ramp protocol . this experimental setup allowed us to simultaneously image the ca2+ signal and monitor the effects of atp and/or astrocyte ca2+ signalling on both the post-synaptic currents  and the cytosolic ca2+ of the reporter neuron.

although the identified reporter neurons were flooded by the long atp puff  and surrounded by atp-responsive nac astrocytes , astroglial burst-like ca2+ signalling caused no significant changes in cytosolic ca2+  of these neurons. we measured neuronal ca2+  and spontaneous post-synaptic currents  under control, atp and distinct washout periods  and found no significant changes in any of these parameters .

similarly to atp application , postsynaptic currents of neurons within the astroglial ca2+ signalling network did not exhibit significant changes in control frequency and amplitude  under  <dig> μm suc ,  <dig> μm suc+atp  and washout  periods . these findings supported our conclusion that nac neurons did not participate in astroglial ca2+ signalling elicited by atp and/or suc.

discussion
we described that atp evokes burst-like propagation of ca2+ signals amongst astrocytes in the nac. we disclosed for the first time that suc does also induce ca2+ transients. we will discuss the mechanisms of ca2+ signalling amongst astrocytes in the nac and their possible relation to neuronal activity. the potential importance of metabolites related to brain energy state regulating ca2+ signals will also be speculated.

intercellular ca2+ signalling through cx <dig> containing astrocytes in the nac
the atp-evoked burst-like ca2+ signal apparently propagates through astrocytes coupled by gap-junctions  <cit> . more extensive ca2+ signalling in response to the localized atp stimuli in the nac as compared to nearby brain areas may possibly be due to the more abundant presence of cx <dig> protein and gap-junctions thereupon. our observations also suggest that cx <dig> containing gap-junctions participate in burst-like ca2+ signalling and were expressed only in astrocytes  <cit> . note, however, that co-localization of cx <dig> and gfap may also be associated with reactive astrocytes  <cit>  or radial glia  <cit> .

astroglial burst-like ca2+ signals are known to propagate via two mechanisms  <cit> : transfer of cytosolic inositol -trisphosphate  directly from cell to cell through gap junction channels and release of atp onto extracellular purinergic receptors. the cbx-sensitive ca2+ signal is coupled with the atp-triggered enhancement of ip <dig> and its diffusion through gap-junction channels between neighbouring astrocytes  <cit> . another possible way of cbx- and ffa-sensitive propagation of the ca2+ signal involves sequential activation of cation channels by atp that is released through gap-junction hemichannels into the extracellular space  <cit> . these cbx-sensitive ca2+ waves could be blocked by sur, a polysulfonated napthylurea used as a broad spectrum antagonist at purine-activated p2x channels and g-protein-coupled p2y receptors  <cit> . in our experiments sur  did not block the atp-activated ca2+ bursts significantly, although it is known to antagonize p2x receptors in the 1- <dig> μm range  <cit> . nevertheless, our results corroborate previous data suggesting that sur, the widely used antagonist of the effects of atp at p <dig> purinoceptors, also induces calcium inducible calcium release  and increases open channel probability of ryanodine receptor channels  <cit> . these findings can explain the apparent ineffectiveness of sur as a p <dig> antagonist by the opposing sur-induced ca2+ enhancements through the direct activation of intracellular ca2+ stores.

in contrast, the blockade of both atp- and the p2y1-selective 2-me-s-adp-evoked ca2+ transients by the p2y <dig> selective antagonist mrs <dig> indicated that the astroglial burst-like ca2+ signal may possibly be evoked by activation of the p2y <dig> receptor subtype in the nac. the observed variability in mrs <dig> effects may be related to developmental changes of p2y <dig> receptors  <cit>  resulting through receptor/cell heterogeneity within the shell/core regions of nac slices prepared from 10- <dig> day old rats. in addition, endogenous suc may have a co-stimulatory role in atp-induced astroglial ca2+ signalling and, by  antagonizing the effects of the p2y <dig> inhibitor mrs <dig> as observed with human platelets  <cit> , may contribute to the inter-slice/rat variability observed. it may be significant in this regard, that co-application of suc and atp apparently results in more durable ca2+ transients, conjecturing coincidence detection.

as discussed before, ca2+ store mobilization, underlying propagating astroglial burst-like ca2+ transients can occur via p2y <dig> receptor activation in the nac. both the inhibitor profile  and dynamics of atp-evoked ca2+ waves suggest cell-to-cell signalling through the gap-junction-coupled astrocytes in the nac. low ffa efficacy may be due to the possible enhancement of intracellular ca2+ by ffa acting at type  <dig> transient receptor potential canonical channel   <cit> .

as outlined above, the alternative atp-driven way of signal propagation  <cit>  may not be excluded purely on the basis of the apparent lack of sur blockade of atp-evoked ca2+ signals. binding of cbx to suc receptor  <cit> , however, could be accounted for some blockade of atp-driven ca2+ signal propagation as detailed below.

nac astrocytes respond to suc
suc binding sites have previously been disclosed in rat forebrain and human nac membrane homogenates  <cit> , however, their functions have not been assigned yet. identity of suc-sensitive ghb  <cit>  and ghb-sensitive suc  <cit>  binding sites raised the possibility to relate suc and different ghb actions  <cit> . importantly, the binding site of ghb/suc interacts with cbx  <cit> , a blocker of gap-junctions that are major players of astroglial ca2+ signalling  <cit> . we have also shown previously that ghb activates intracellular store-dependent ca2+ transients in nac astrocytes  <cit> . here we report, that suc induced repetitive ca2+ transients occur in a subpopulation of cx43+ and gfap+ cells responding to atp with burst-like ca2+ signals involving gap-junctions. suc may bind to a purinergic g protein coupled receptor  subtype or some other suc-responsive membrane receptor such as sucnr <dig> . interestingly, the sucnr <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig> as part of a cluster of seven gpcrs in close vicinity to the genes for p2y <dig>  <cit> . also, direct effect of suc on gap-junctions cannot be excluded. the sucnr <dig> has recently been shown to regulate cellular functions implicated in renal blood pressure regulation  <cit>  and lipolysis of white adipose tissue  <cit> . in addition, the sucnr <dig> may also have a role for immunity, hyperglycemia, retinal neovascularization, ischemic liver injury and hematopoiesis as reviewed recently  <cit> . the presence of sucnr <dig> has been demonstrated in human platelets and megakaryocytes  <cit> , in various cells of distal nephron  <cit>  and in cardiomyocytes  <cit> .

the concentration of suc in plasma  <cit>  increases with exercise  <cit> , metabolic acidosis  <cit> , hypertension and metabolic diseases  <cit>  from  <dig> μm up to  <dig> μm. these data suggest that the tissue concentration of suc can be high enough to induce astroglial ca2+ transients characterised by the ec <dig> value for suc-responsive cells within the range of 50- <dig> μm. using arachidonic acid, adp and suc as platelet agonists, aggregation in response to suc alone was highly variable with only 29% of donors showing a  platelet response  <cit> . in contrast, suc reproducibly and concentration-dependently enhanced platelet aggregation in response to low concentrations of exogenous adp  <cit> . assuming the presence of sucnr <dig> and p2y <dig> in astrocyte membrane, we conjecture co-stimulatory roles played by endogenous suc and atp within the brain. such a coincidence detection performed by astrocytes could explain why astrocytic ca2+ transients may be dramatically affected by pathological conditions associated with intense neuronal firing  <cit> .

signalling layer independent of neurones
it has been reported, that mechanically evoked astrocytic ca2+ waves mediated by the release of atp and the activation of p <dig> receptors in hippocampal cultures down-regulate excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in an atp-dependent manner  <cit> . using astrocyte-specific inducible transgenic mice , it has been evidenced that by the release of atp, which accumulates as adenosine, astrocytes tonically suppress synaptic transmission in acutely isolated hippocampal slices  <cit> . causal linkage between reduced activation of adenosine receptors and surface expression of nmda receptors has also been evidenced . we assumed therefore, that by using atp puff, which may also reduce activity of nac neurons, we could isolate 'autonomous' astrocytic ca2+ signalling. indeed, the loading pattern of the ca2+ indicator fluo- <dig> am  <cit>  and the presence of cx <dig> protein in cells responding to suc/atp by ca2+ transients identified them as astrocytes.

propagation of the ca2+ signal in ellipsoidal and/or radial waveform at a speed of approximately  <dig> μm/s in nac astrocytes is comparable to the time evolution of bergmann glia ca2+ transients, as previously recorded from fixed location in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . the similarity suggests both phenomena involve atp-triggered release of ca2+ from intracellular stores, as found. the type of glial ca2+ signalling classified as bursts persisted after application of ttx in the cerebellar bergmann glia in vivo  <cit>  and nac astrocytes in vitro . unchanged postsynaptic currents and an invariable cytosolic ca2+ level of neurons within the astrocyte network that exhibited concerted ca2+ bursts support our conclusion that the atp evokes astroglial burst-like ca2+ signals independently of neuronal activity in the nac. in this respect, atp/suc-evoked astrocytic ca2+ transients differ from the ones dependent on the metabotropic glu recptor subtype  <dig>  leading to the activation of the nr2b subunit containing n-me-d-asp receptors  of medium spiny neurones in the nac or the striatum  <cit> . our conclusion upholds previous findings by us  <cit>  and others , suggesting the existence of "autonomous" activation of astroglial ca2+ signals. remarkably, glial ca2+ bursting activity observed in the cerebellum of awake, behaving animal is also found to be independent of neuronal activity  <cit> .

findings obtained with the nac model of glia activation described in this work do not exclude, however, that ca2+ signalling involving atp/suc sensing cells might be a unique feature of the nac. we may also assume such a signalling route in other brain areas exhibiting extensive cx <dig> expression. the way of ca2+ signalling is probably characteristic of a given brain region  <cit> . ca2+ bursts have been shown in cultured astrocytes  <cit> , white matter tract  <cit> , cerebellum  <cit>  and cortical brain slices  <cit> . ca2+ bursts in the neocortex depend on gap-junction coupling of astrocytes and are not influenced by neuronal activity while in the corpus callosum ca2+ signalling requires atp-release mechanism but not gap-junction expression  <cit> . these pathways are not independent from each other and most probably linked to the cell types participated in ca2+ signalling  <cit> . in the retina, astrocytic ca2+ wave is dependent on gap-junctions, while the wave propagation between astrocytes and müller cells requires atp-release mechanism  <cit> . the expression of the major gap-junction protein of astrocytes cx <dig> influences purinergic receptor expression in the spinal cord astrocytes  <cit> . these examples rather support the view that glial ca2+ bursts may represent a signalling layer independent of neurons.

the issue of independence as opposed to interdependence of glial and neuronal activities is related to the question of astrocytic release of signalling molecules that may also modulate synaptic transmission, a process called gliotransmission. as outlined before, there are several indications, that astrocytes do affect synaptic activity through the release of atp, glu, d-ser, tumour necrosis factor alpha  or uptake of glu  <cit>  and gaba  <cit> . it is to note, that the physiological relevance of gliotransmission in long-term potentiation  was called into question . in contrast, ca2+-dependent release of d-ser from an astrocyte affecting nmdar-dependent plasticity was demonstrated by clamping internal ca2+ in individual astrocytes of the ca <dig> area of the hippocampus  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
diverse cellular pathways of astroglial ca2+ signals are differently pronounced in various brain regions and they can also co-occur. besides, the initial stimuli are likely a determinant of the relevant physiological function being involved.

the findings of the present study describe for the first time the ca2+ signals evoked in astrocytes of the brain reward area, the nucleus accumbens, by the citric acid cycle intermediate suc. we also identify these suc-responsive ca2+ signals in atp-evoked burst-like intercellular ca2+ signalling. we provide evidence that atp- and suc-responsive glial ca2+ signals are independent on neuronal activity therefore apparently represent a signalling layer independent of nac neurons.

atp-induced calcium responses have previously been shown in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes whereas succinate-induced calcium signals had not been described in astrocytes. this previously unrecognized glial action of the major cellular energy metabolite suc may represent a link between brain energy states and ca2+ signalling in astrocytic networks.
