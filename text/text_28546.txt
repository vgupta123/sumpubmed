BACKGROUND
"“the most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in the different species of geospiza, from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and… even to that of a warbler… seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.”"

charles r. darwin, the voyage of the beagle
 <cit> 

since their collection by charles darwin and fellow members of the hms beagle expedition from the galápagos islands in  <dig> and their introduction to science, these birds have been subjected to intense research. many biology textbooks use darwin’s finches  to illustrate a variety of topics in evolutionary theory, including speciation, natural selection, and niche partitioning
 <cit> . darwin’s finches continue to be a very valuable source of biological discovery. several unique characteristics of this clade have allowed multiple important recent breakthroughs in our understanding of changes in island biodiversity, mechanisms of repeated speciation coupled with ecological diversification, evolution of cognitive behaviours, principles of beak/jaw biomechanics as well as the underlying developmental genetic mechanisms in generating morphological diversity
 <cit> .

recent molecular phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that the adaptive radiation of darwin’s finches in the galápagos archipelago took place in the last 2– <dig> million years , following their evolution from a finch-like tanager ancestral species that probably arrived on the islands from central or south america . nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial dna have undergone limited diversification, partly because the galápagos history of the finches has been relatively short, and partly because of introgressive hybridization
 <cit> . morphological evolution in this group of birds is a fast and ongoing process that has been documented over the years in multiple publications on their population-level ecology, morphology and behaviour
 <cit> .
 <cit> .

beak size and shape, as well as body size, are the principal phenotypic traits that have diversified in darwin’s finches
 <cit> . the most studied group within the darwin’s finches is the monophyletic genus geospiza, which includes three distinct bill shapes: the basal sharp-billed finch g. difficilis has a small and symmetrical beak used to feed on a mixed diet of insects and seeds; cactus finches g. scandens and g. conirostris feature an elongated and pointed bill suitable for probing cactus flowers and fruit; and ground finches possess deep and broad bills adapted for cracking seeds
 <cit> . among the ground finches, which include small, medium and large species, the large ground finch g. magnirostris has the most modified beak that it uses to crack  large and hard seeds . importantly, beak shapes develop during early embryogenesis and finch hatchlings show species-specific features. recent molecular analysis has shown that the ground finch bill morphology correlates with a developmentally earlier and broader gene expression of bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> , especially in the large ground finch. functional experiments mimicking such changes in bmp <dig> expression using laboratory chicken embryos are consistent with its role in this geospiza beak trait
 <cit> . similar experiments elucidated the roles of three further developmental factors, transforming growth factor beta receptor type ii , beta-catenin  and dickkopf- <dig> , at later stages of beak development that help in forming the bill shapes that are unique to ground finches
 <cit> . other analyses revealed an important role of change in calmodulin  expression pattern for the development of elongated bills of cactus finches
 <cit> .

in  <dig> we initiated a project to sequence the genomes of some of the darwin’s finches . in particular, we were motivated to perform a whole genome analysis of the large ground finch g. magnirostris because of the evolutionary importance of the entire clade of darwin’s finches to the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology, the potential of genomic analysis for uncovering the genetic basis of key phenotypic traits and the scarcity of genomic studies of birds . the species was chosen because it arose relatively recently and it has one of the most adapted and distinctive bill shapes. the embryonic individual chosen for genome sequencing was sampled from a population from the small and well isolated island of genovesa which exhibit the largest bills of all existing darwin’s finches, with an estimated effective population size of 75– <dig> individuals
 <cit> .

the field of evolutionary and comparative genomics will benefit more broadly from analyzing an additional species of passerine. g. magnirostris diverged from the first sequenced passerine, the zebra finch 
 <cit> , approximately  <dig> my ago
 <cit> , which is comparable to the divergence time separating mouse and rat
 <cit> . the g. magnirostris genome assembly has not been assembled into chromosomes or long contigs so we cannot investigate whether this interval of time has seen radical changes in its karyotype; however, such changes are unlikely since avian karyotypes typically are stable
 <cit> . nevertheless, we can investigate a variety of other evolutionary processes, such as whether episodes of positive selection have occurred along the g. magnirostris terminal lineage and whether there has been rapid gains and losses  of functional sequence across the avian clade.

the genome assembly and analysis presented here should permit population genetics approaches to be applied to darwin’s finch species and subpopulations in order to identify the genetic basis of their recent adaptations.

RESULTS
a g. magnirostris genome assembly
a dna sample was taken from a g. magnirostris individual embryo collected during a field trip to the island of genovesa  in  <dig>  sequencing was performed using the roche  <dig> technology with both long read and mate-pairs libraries, and then assembled using roche’s algorithm newbler, as described in the materials and methods. the resulting assembly contains  <dig>  mbp across  <dig>  scaffolds with a scaffold n <dig> of 382kbp and a median read coverage of  <dig> -fold.

completeness of the g. magnirostris genome assembly was estimated using two approaches. first, we determined the amount of euchromatic sequence that aligns between zebra finch and chicken, but that does not align to g. magnirostris. since chicken is an outgroup to both zebra finch and g. magnirostris, we can assume that most sequence present in both the zebra finch and chicken genome assemblies will also be present in the g. magnirostris assembly, with rare exceptions where lineage-specific deletions have occurred along the darwin's finch lineage. thus, the  <dig> mb of chicken sequence aligned to zebra finch that is absent from the g. magnirostris assembly provides an estimate of the g. magnirostris euchromatic genome assembly’s incompleteness. second, the assembly consists of approximately  <dig>  gb of sequence data, and the depth of coverage for reads on assembled contigs peaks at  <dig> . consequently, under a simplifying assumption that all regions of the genome are equally represented in libraries and among successful sequencing runs, an estimate of the true genome size is  <dig> / <dig>  or  <dig>  gb. in summary, the g. magnirostris genome assembly is estimated to cover approximately 89% of the euchromatic genome or approximately 76% of the complete genome. the estimated  <dig>  gb size of the g. magnirostris genome is similar to the mean avian genome size .

we expect this g. magnirostris genome assembly to be most incomplete within highly repetitive sequence. use of either a library of transposable element sequences constructed from the g. magnirostris genome  or a zebra finch repeat library resulted in the identification of  <dig> % or  <dig> % of the assembly as being repetitive, respectively. this proportion is over two-fold lower than observed for zebra finch or chicken genomes
 <cit> , and it is clear that there is a deficit of closely-related transposable elements present in the g. magnirostris assembly . highly repetitive sequence in the g. magnirostris genome is thus likely to be disproportionately missing from the assembly.

assembly sequence quality was assessed first by examining whether gt-ag dinucleotide splice sites in  <dig>  chicken genes, each with a single orthologue in zebra finch and g. magnirostris, exhibited apparently substituted nucleotides in aligned g. magnirostris sequence.  <dig> of  <dig>   of these nucleotides showed sequence changes, providing an estimate of the assembly’s nucleotide substitution errors. although this is higher than error rates inferred in other sequenced avian genomes, such as the  <dig> % rate estimated for zebra finch
 <cit> , it is likely to overestimate the true error rate, because some substitutions will reflect mis-alignments or genuine point mutations. in a second approach, we counted the number of insertions or deletions  that are present in the three-way alignment of zebrafinch with g. magnirostris and a g. fortis sequence that was recently released . if one conservatively assumes that there have been no g. magnirostris lineage-specific indels then the upper-bound estimate for the indel error is  <dig>  indels per kb of aligned sequence. these errors will have led to a lowering of the number of protein-coding gene models that we predict for g. magnirostris.

these approaches took advantage of whole genome alignments constructed for g. magnirostris and chicken, zebra finch and turkey. 57% of the g. magnirostris assembly aligned to chicken and 58% to turkey , which is similar to the 58% and 56% of the zebra finch assembly that aligned to chicken and turkey, respectively
 <cit> . a large proportion  of the darwin’s finch genome could be aligned to zebra finch , consistent with their more recent ancestry than with chicken or turkey, which are both galliforms.

the g. magnirostris genome assembly has a g+c proportion of  <dig> %, which is similar to all other evaluated amniote genomes. medium-sized scaffolds  were more g+c-rich  than small or large scaffolds . visual inspection of the g. magnirostris genome reveals that it exhibits substantial spatial heterogeneity in its base composition; similarly to all other amniotic genomes, but unlike that of the anolis lizard
 <cit> , genic g+c content of genomic regions has remained relatively constant .

neutral indel model analysis
the neutral indel model  of lunter et al. <cit>  provides an estimate of the amount of sequence that has been functionally constrained in one or both members of a species pair since their last common ancestor. the method takes advantage of an expectation that autosomal indels in a genome-wide pairwise sequence alignment occur randomly once account has been taken of fluctuations in g+c content. where their density is relatively low it is assumed that there is a greater likelihood that additional insertion or deletion variants have been preferentially purged in functional sequence. the nim first constructs histograms of the lengths of inter-gap segments  from whole genome pairwise alignments, and then measures the departure of the observed igs frequency distribution from the random distribution expected under neutral evolution. the excess of long igss compared to the neutral expectation allows the quantity of constrained, indel-purified, sequence shared between the two species to be inferred.

the nim method estimates there to be 80– <dig> mb of constrained sequence between chicken and g. magnirostris, similar to the amount of constrained sequence  estimated between the comparably divergent chicken and zebra finch species . however, these estimates are substantially smaller than the amount of constrained sequence estimated between zebra finch and g. magnirostris  . since zebra finch and g. magnirostris are more closely related than either is to chicken, these results are consistent with the loss of shared functional sequence over avian evolution, and the gain of lineage-specific functional sequence, as has been inferred previously in mammals
 <cit> . it is notable also that the lower bound estimate of sequence constraint is far in excess of the quantity of protein-coding sequence  in avian genomes, implying that the majority of functional sequence in avian genomes is noncoding, probably regulatory, sequence. as has been observed for eutherian mammals
 <cit> , genomic regions with elevated g+c content tend to contain a higher density of constrained sequence .
 <dig>  additional file
 <dig> and additional file
 <dig>  predicted amounts of constrained sequence estimated between three avian species pairs plotted against  the synonymous substitution divergence  and  gc content of equally populated gc bins, with data inferred from the t. guttata – g. magnirostris and g. gallus – g. magnirostris alignments, respectively. the larger amount of constrained sequence inferred for the g. magnirostris and t. guttata comparison compared to the two chicken – finch comparisons implies that there is functional sequence that is passerine-specific and thus not present in chicken.

g. magnirostris predicted genes and orthologues
we predicted  <dig>  protein-coding genes in the g. magnirostris genome assembly. to do so we aligned protein-coding sequences from three amniote species, human, chicken, and zebra finch, to the g. magnirostris genome assembly, and reconciled overlapping transcript predictions using the gpipe pipeline
 <cit> . to analyse the evolution of g. magnirostris protein-coding genes, the orthologues and paralogues among g. magnirostris and seven other euteleostomi  were assigned using the optic pipeline
 <cit> . we then produced a high quality set of  <dig>  simple orthologue sets  among the seven amniote species. these  <dig>  gene sets represent a stringent set of evolutionarily conserved “core” protein-coding genes in vertebrates.

examining the completeness of these gene sets, we noted that there were  <dig>  simple 1: <dig> orthologue sets between human and zebra finch, while there were only  <dig>  simple 1: <dig> orthologue sets between human and g. magnirostris. the smaller gene orthologue set between human and g. magnirostris could imply that 27% of genes are missing from the gene set, and thus the gene set could be 73% complete. a similar proportion  of  <dig>  metazoan single copy orthologues curated by creevey et al. <cit>  have orthologues among our predicted g. magnirostris genes. our approaches ensure that each gene in these orthologue sets has at least one transcript that covers at least 80% of the human, chicken or zebrafinch template transcript. we note that these gene set completeness estimates are lower-bound estimates for assembly completeness since this orthology analysis will exclude some partially, imperfectly or fragmentary predicted g. magnirostris gene models.

evolutionary rate analysis
evolutionary rates  were inferred for the filtered alignments for the  <dig>  sets of orthologues for seven amniote species . the median ds value for the g. magnirostris lineage  is over 15-fold larger than our predicted nucleotide error rate , which indicates that sequencing errors will have little effect on most of our comparative genomic analyses. the estimated median ds value between zebra finch and g. magnirostris  is similar to that for chicken and turkey. divergence of chicken and turkey lineages occurred approximately two-fold earlier  than the presumed zebra finch and g. magnirostris lineages split . this implies that neutral evolution was approximately two-times faster in the zebra finch and g. magnirostris lineages than in the chicken and turkey lineages, which is consistent with previous findings
 <cit> . a similarly elevated neutral evolutionary rate observed for the rodent lineage has been ascribed to their shorter generation times and their greater rate of dna replication errors during germ cell division
 <cit> . the generation time of chicken  is shorter than that of extant geospiza species . nevertheless, the relatively rapid rate of neutral evolution for the zebra finch or g. magnirostris lineages would be consistent with historic generation times, over the last  <dig> million years, for their ancestral species being much shorter than for extant ones.

the lineage-specific median dn/ds value is slightly smaller for geospiza than it is for zebra finch . smaller dn/ds values are expected for lineages with larger effective population sizes ne <cit> , which implies that since the last common ancestor of zebra finch and g. magnirostris historic ne values have been high, far higher than the very low ne values of 38– <dig> of extant geospiza species
 <cit>  and closer to the current effective population size of zebra finch 
 <cit> .

for each of the  <dig>  sets of orthologs we next inferred amino acid sites that evolved under positive selection along the g. magnirostris lineage, and each of the other three avian lineages. for this we used a branch-sites method
 <cit>  and a bayes empirical bayes approach
 <cit>  to predict sites that evolved under positive selection . this procedure resulted in predicting  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> positively-selected genes  in g. magnirostris, zebra finch, chicken and turkey lineages, respectively . this is far fewer than reported previously in avian genomes
 <cit> , which likely reflects the lower number of genes that we analysed, the fact these genes are from a more widely conserved orthologue set, and the stringent filters on aligned sites that we needed to employ to discard potentially misaligned or poor quality sequence. three of the g. magnirostris psgs  may have been subject to gc-biased gene conversion
 <cit>  as indicated from their relatively high numbers of at→gc substitutions .
 <cit> .

genes that are predicted to have been under positive selection in the g. magnirostris lineage have elevated values of dn/ds in that lineage, but not the t. guttata lineage, and vice versa . of the 21 g. magnirostris psgs , three were identified as psgs in other avian lineages: xanthine dehydrogenase , perhaps as a result of its role in the innate immune system
 <cit> , mitochondrial atp binding cassette  transporter, abcb <dig>  which is essential for erythropoiesis
 <cit>  and nebulin , which encodes a large muscle protein
 <cit> .

p-values of less than  <dig>  are highlighted in bold.

two g. magnirostris psgs are of particular note: pou1f <dig>  and igf2r . these genes’ putatively adaptive amino acid substitutions were confirmed using sequence data from g. fortis 
 <cit>  and from g. difficilis  . disruption of either gene in the mouse is known to result in craniofacial abnormalities
 <cit>  and pou1f <dig>  despite its description as a pituitary-specific transcription factor in mammals
 <cit> , is differentially expressed in the developing beaks of ducks, quails and chickens
 <cit> . there is a functional link between these two genes since pou1f <dig> regulates prolactin and growth hormone genes in mammals and birds
 <cit> , and decreased growth hormone results in a decrease in activity of the insulin/igf- <dig> signalling pathway
 <cit> . in mouse bone, growth hormone is known to regulate many genes of the insulin/igf- <dig> or wnt signaling pathways, as well as bmp <dig> <cit>  whose gene expression change is linked to bill morphology in g. magnirostris <cit> . moreover, a key member of the igf pathway  was identified in darwin’s finches as one of the top differentially expressed candidate genes in a microarray screen in species with divergent beak shapes
 <cit> . positive selection acting on pou1f <dig> and igf2r may thus have contributed to the evolution of beak morphology in the g. magnirostris lineage. experiments that misexpress pou1f <dig> or igf2r variants during avian craniofacial development will be required to further investigate this hypothesis.

we also predicted  <dig> genes to have been under positive selection on the passerine branch prior to the split of the zebra finch and g. magnirostris lineages . performing an enrichment analysis to test whether any gene ontology  terms
 <cit>  were overrepresented among genes with positively selected sites along the passerine branch identified ‘cilium’  as the most significantly enriched term . this term is annotated to three passerine psgs: coiled-coil domain containing  <dig> , axonemal dynein intermediate chain  <dig> , and cytoplasmic dynein  <dig> light intermediate chain  <dig> . dnai <dig> protein is a component of respiratory ciliary axonemes and sperm flagella, and human dnai <dig> mutations are associated with respiratory tract dysfunction and infertility
 <cit> . dync2li <dig> is present in the mammalian ciliary axoneme
 <cit> . two further passerine psgs, namely coiled-coil domain containing  <dig>  and its paralogous gene, coiled-coil domain containing  <dig> , are likely to possess functions related to cilia and spermatazoan flagella , although this is not reflected in current go annotations.

ccdc <dig> is of particular interest as it has evolved unusually rapidly along the passerine branch . it is predicted to harbour 40% more positively selected sites than any other gene inferred for any branch, making it the most pervasively positive selected of all the genes we tested.  <dig> codon sites in ccdc <dig> that are shared by g. magnirostris and zebra finch were identified as having been subject to positive selection , and all  <dig> of these codon site changes were validated using g. fortis sequence data . it is likely that vertebrate ccdc <dig> and ccdc <dig> homologues encode spermatazoan flagella proteins because its chlamydomonas reinhardtii homologue mbo2
 <cit>  is a flagellar protein, and its fruitfly homologues are involved in fertility: ory maps to the ks- <dig> fertility factor region, cg <dig> homozygous mutants are sterile
 <cit> , and cg <dig> is specifically expressed in the testis. in addition, human ccdc <dig> shows the strongest differential expression in the testis . the positive selection we infer across five passerine genes  thus could have been a consequence of sperm competition
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this first genome sequence of a darwin’s finch has utility beyond the purview of darwin’s finch biology. avian species are currently under-sampled as a taxonomic group compared with mammals. moreover, the passerine order contains over half of all bird species, which equates to approximately  <dig>  identified species, almost as many as the total number of mammalian species
 <cit> . however, passerines were only represented previously by the genomes of the zebra finch
 <cit>  and the flycatcher
 <cit> , and our range of genome-scale resources should now facilitate further research into the evolution of this unusual group of passerine birds. our identification of positively selected genes on the passerine branch not mentioned in previous studies that used only the zebra finch genome sequence
 <cit>  demonstrates the extra power this additional passerine sequence provides for investigating wider avian biology.

in addition to providing the g. magnirostris reads  and the genome assembly , we are now providing gene predictions, orthology relationships, and gene phylogenies generated by this project to browse and to download from http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/clades/vertebrates_geospiza_v <dig>  high quality multiple sequence alignments and regions predicted to have been subject to indel-purifying selection have also been made available from http://wwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.uk/~chrisr/gmag_data/. whilst the g. magnirostris genome assembly remains incomplete, like many vertebrate genome sequences, it should be finished to high quality once the cost of high quality sequencing is sufficiently reduced. despite, its draft status the genome assembly provides an important foundation for genetic studies of single genes, and for population genomic studies of most of the genes not just for g. magnirostris but also for all other, closely-related, darwin’s finches. these population approaches should assist in providing an accurate and detailed picture of the demography and phylogenetic history of these finches before and since they arrived on the galápagos islands approximately 2– <dig> my ago
 <cit> . considering the rapid and dramatic morphological and ecological evolution of darwin’s finches, the comparative study of their genomes will provide valuable insights for speciation genomics, an emerging field of genomics studying genomic-level alterations that accompany processes of divergence and speciation in natural populations
 <cit> .
