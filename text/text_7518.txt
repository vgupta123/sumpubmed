BACKGROUND
lameness in pigs is a common problem in modern swine husbandry, affecting up to 19% of finishing pigs  <cit> . it has negative consequences both from an animal welfare as well as from an economic point of view. lameness seriously impairs welfare and may have an effect on all of brambell’s “five freedoms”  <cit> . the economic impact of lameness is caused by lower productivity in lame animals, the cost of treating affected animals and the cost of premature culling of animals  <cit> , <cit> . the aforementioned welfare and economic issues can be minimized if veterinarians provide evidence-based advice on treating and preventing lameness. detection of lameness needs to be sensitive and reliable, and treatment and prevention strategies need to be assessed using objective, repeatable methods to quantify lameness.

as already proven in other animals including man, pressure mats are a noninvasive and objective tool to quantitatively assess gait, providing kinetic and temporospatial data. their use has increased lately as they seem to have some distinct advantages over other, ‘classical’ methods to analyze gait, like force plates and infrared high-speed camera systems. when using pressure mats, it is possible to measure consecutive, overlapping and even simultaneous footfalls, thus enabling the collection of several footfalls in one run. moreover, an elaborate calibration setup that some other, aforementioned methods would require for a 3d kinetic and kinematic analysis is not needed. in addition, pressure plates with high sensor density provide information on the pressure distribution between different regions, for example between different claws within the foot.

pressure mats have been used to study gait in several other quadruped species, such as horses  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , dogs  <cit> , and cats  <cit> . most of these studies focused on sound animals. considerably less information, however, is available on the sensitivity and reliability of pressure mats to objectively distinguish lame from sound animals. earlier studies in dogs and cattle indeed reported that it is possible to distinguish lame from sound individuals  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . however, hardly any information on the use of pressure mat analysis to detect lameness in pigs is available yet. only one single study was identified that described lameness in sows using pressure mat analysis, but only peak vertical pressure symmetry was used to objectively quantify lameness  <cit> .

therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of four kinetic pressure mat parameters  to distinguish clinically lame from sound weaned piglets.

we assessed compensatory weight redistribution by calculating the asymmetry-indices  for several combinations of limbs and for each of the pressure mat parameters. in order to compare this new method to the method that is currently used most often in lameness research in pigs , correlations of total left-right asis for the four pressure mat parameters with visual scores of lameness were assessed as well. we used receiver-operated characteristic  curve analysis to determine the optimal cutoff values of total left-right asi to identify lame pigs.

RESULTS
mean body mass was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg for the lame pigs and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg for the sound pigs and did not differ between groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). mean velocity was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s in the sound pigs and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s in the lame pigs. the velocity was lower in the lame pigs compared to the sound pigs  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

the visual gait score  in the lame pigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig> .

contralateral forelimb asi for pvf differed between groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and was higher in the animals that were lame on a forelimb compared to animals that were lame on a hind limb or animals that were not lame . load rate cfl differed between groups as well  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and animals that were lame on a forelimb had higher cfl than animals that were lame on a hind limb and sound animals. a difference between all groups was present in the cfl of vi  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). although cfl of pvp also differed between groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), the mann-whitney u test only showed a difference between sound animals and animals that were lame on a forelimb.

contralateral hind limb asi  was different between groups for all parameters  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), lr  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), vi  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and pvp  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> )). the posthoc mann-whitney u test showed a difference between all groups for pvf and vi. sound animals had lower asis than animals that were lame on a forelimb or animals that were lame on a hind limb for lr and pvp, but there was no difference between animals that were lame on a forelimb and animals that were lame on a hind limb for these parameters.

the asi of the ipsilateral left limbs  differed between the three groups for pvf  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), lr  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and vi  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), but not for pvp. in the post-hoc analysis of ill of pvf, pigs that were lame on the left limb had higher ills than pigs that were lame on the right limb and sound pigs. ill of lr and vi were higher in pigs that were lame on the left limb compared to sound animals.

ipsilateral right limb asi  differed between groups for pvf  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and pvp  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), and the posthoc mann-whitney u test showed the animals that were lame on a right limb had higher asis than sound animals. the difference between groups was also found for lr  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), with sound animals having lower asis than lame animals, regardless of which limb was lame. vi  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) differed between groups with the animals that were lame on the right limbs having higher asis than other animals.

for all parameters, diagonal lf/rh asi  was different between groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), lr  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), vi  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), pvp  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> )). animals that were lame on the left fore or right hind limb had higher dll than animals than animals that were lame on the right fore or left hind limb and had higher dll than sound animals for pvf and vi. lr dll was lower in sound animals than in other animals. for pvp, all groups differed from each other, with animals that were lame on the left fore or right hind limb having higher dll than animals that were lame on the right fore or left hind limb and sound animals.

diagonal asi of right front limb and left hind limb  differed between groups for all parameters  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), lr  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), vi  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), pvp  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> )). pigs that were lame on the right fore or left hind limb had higher dlr for pvf and vi compared to the sound group. for lr, all groups differed from each other. sound animals had lower pvp dlr than lame animals.

clt  was higher in lame animals compared to sound animals for all parameters  = - <dig> , p =  <dig> , lr: t = - <dig> , p =  <dig> ), vi: t = - <dig> , p =  <dig> , pvp: t = - <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

correlation with visual scoring
the visual score of the  <dig> pigs correlated highly with clt of pvf , clt of vi , clt of lr  and clt of pvp .

roc analysis
the roc analysis showed distinct cutoff values with 100% sensitivity and specificity for all four parameters. the cutoff value calculated from the roc analysis was  <dig>  for clt of pvf,  <dig>  for clt of lr,  <dig>  for clt of vi and  <dig>  for clt of pvp.

discussion
data collection from both lame and sound pigs appeared relatively simple, as both groups showed exploratory behavior and a strong response to the treats. lame pigs walked at a slower mean velocity than sound pigs. this is in agreement with findings in sows  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> , <cit> . velocity itself may provide an indicator for lameness. however, there is some overlap between lame pigs and sound pigs on this measure. also, in practice, velocities can only be measured and compared under standardized conditions. it may be difficult to distinguish the different velocities by visual judgment. lastly, velocity per se does not provide any clue as to which limb is the lame one. directional asi’s can provide this information. velocity, however, may be a first indicator to direct a farmer’s or veterinarian’s attention to certain pigs; a pig moving exceptionally slow may warrant further examination. incorporation of “walking speed” as a parameter into lameness scoring protocols therefor may be advisable.

the lame pigs in this study were selected from a commercial breeding farm without prior knowledge of the cause of the lameness. as a result, the group with the lame pigs was rather heterogeneous, with several pathomorphological diagnoses on different locations in the limbs. since the kinetic parameters we used were representing the forces in the entire limb, we did not expect location of the lesion  to influence the magnitude of asis. however, the study group was not large enough to make any definitive statements on this subject.

redistribution of pressure mat parameters
contralateral
the contralateral asymmetry was assessed from the cfl and chl parameters. cfl compares the two forelimbs to each other. if a pig is lame on a forelimb, it will reduce the amount of force put on that limb by shifting it towards the other forelimb, and to a lesser extent to the ipsilateral and diagonal hind limbs. thus, it is possible that in a pig that is lame on a forelimb, the hind limb asymmetry  also increases due to a mechanical compensation, as there is no pain related lameness in these hind limbs. in our experiment, as expected the cfl was increased in forelimb lame pigs compared to that recorded in sound pigs. the chl of pigs that were lame on a forelimb was also higher than that of the sound animals. the increased asymmetry in the forelimbs was also found in studies on lame horses  <cit>  and dogs  <cit> , <cit>  for pvf and vi, and for pvp in lame pigs  <cit> . in both the aforementioned equine and canine studies, the increased asymmetry was mainly due to a significant decrease in pvf and vi in the lame limb. the pvf and vi in the contralateral limb did not increase significantly in lame dogs at walk, but did increase in horses at higher lameness grades.

in agreement with our study, also in forelimb lame dogs and horses the chl similarly increased for both pvf as well as vi. this may be due to a significant force shift from the lame forelimb to the diagonal hind limb. moreover, this has been attributed to unloading of the limb ipsilateral to the lame limb   <cit> . we also saw a shift towards the diagonal limb in our lame animals, which would cause asymmetry due to a mechanical lameness also in the hind limbs, even though there is no true pain related lameness present in these limbs.

the load distribution between the two hind limbs is quantified by the chl. indeed, the clh of the hind limb lame pigs in our experiment increased, similar as to earlier findings in hind limb lame dogs, horses and pigs  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . the increased asymmetry may be due to a decreased loading of the lame limb, which was found in horses  <cit>  and dogs  <cit>  and additionally due to an increased loading of the contralateral hind limb. the latter mechanism was observed in the study by fischer et al.  <cit> , whereas in the study by weishaupt et al.  <cit>  it was only observed for vi and not for pvf.

the cfl of animals that were lame on a hind limb was significantly higher than that of sound animals only for vi. this may be because the lameness mainly affects stance time rather that the pvf. this adaptation of timing rather than loading may be a more subtle manifestation of compensation in lame pigs. a significant increase of stance time was found using kinematics in lame sows  <cit> . an increased cfl in walking dogs that were lame on a hind limb was found both for pvf and vi  <cit> , but in trotting horses that were lame on a hind limb no increased asymmetry was found  <cit> . in the dogs, the ipsilateral forelimb had an increased pvf and the diagonal forelimb had an increased vi, thereby influencing forelimb symmetry.

ipsilateral
the fore-hind symmetry is assessed by the ill and ilr. generally, we expected that front-hind asymmetry would increase on the side of the lesion, as was shown previously in dogs  <cit>  and pigs  <cit> . again, the main reason for this asymmetry was unloading of the lame limb  <cit> – <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . with the exception of the study by fischer  <cit> , who found an increased pvf in the ipsilateral limb of dogs, no increase in loading of the ipsilateral limb was found in these studies. in our experiment, we also found an increase in asymmetry on the ipsilateral side of the lameness with the exception of ill of pvp. it may be that the same mechanism that cause lameness in the forelimbs also caused contralateral asymmetry in the hind limbs, namely unloading of the ipsilateral limb  <cit> , causes the difference between the ipsilateral limbs to become smaller, resulting in an increase in asymmetry that is not statistically significant.

there was no increase in ipsilateral symmetry on the side opposite the lesion, except for lr. this is in contrast with the study on walking dogs  <cit> , where a significant increase in ipsilateral asymmetry of pvf and vi was seen on the sound side as well as on the lame side. this change only in load rate may represent a subtle manifestation of compensation.

diagonal
lameness in the left fore or right hind limb caused an increase in dll. lameness in the right fore or left hind limb caused an increase in dlr. this increase was expected, as several studies on horses and dogs have shown redistribution of force away from the lame limb and towards the diagonal limb  <cit> – <cit> . lameness on a diagonal limb pair, however, did not always influence the other diagonal. the only observable change in asi of diagonal limbs in pigs that were lame on the limbs outside the diagonal limb pair, was seen for lr and pvp. bockstahler et al.  <cit>  did not find a similar significant change in diagonal asis for the non-lame limbs for pvf and vi, like was found in our study. this may be due to the relatively high degree of lameness of the pigs in our study, which may have caused a larger effect on other limbs compared to the study by bockstahler et al.

correlation with visual scoring
correlations between visual scoring of lameness and clts of all parameters were high. this finding is in agreement with the study of oosterlinck et al. in dogs  <cit> , who also found good correlations between visual scoring and pvf, vi, and pvp, as recorded using a pressure mat. in that study, pvp was the parameter that correlated lowest with visual gait scores, in contrast to the findings in our study. oosterlinck et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that the decrease in limb loading of the lame limb combined with a concurrent decrease in contact area resulted in a “falsely” low pressure value , rendering pvp as a less reliable parameter. a study in horses  <cit>  that compared visual lameness scoring to force plate, also found significant correlations, particularly with pvf and vi. quinn et al.  <cit> , however, did not find correlations between pvf measured by force plate and numerical rating scale scores of three observers scoring lame dogs. only one out of three observers had a significant correlation between the numerical rating scale score and vi as recorded using a force plate. in that study, the highest correlation was only found when dogs were considerably lame. our study did not include pigs that had a lameness score of  <dig>  used, as such pigs are not easily identified on a farm in a practical situation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, lameness in walking pigs causes an increase in contralateral, ipsilateral and diagonal asymmetry, due to unloading of the lame limb combined with redistribution of this load to the non-lame limbs. however, the six asi’s that were studied only took into account two limbs at a time. animals that were lame on a limb that was not assessed by that asi did not always have a higher asymmetry than sound animals. in situations where it is unknown which is the lame limb, a method that takes into account all four limbs is needed. an example of such a method is the use of overall left-right asis.

using the overall left-right asis we were able to distinguish lame pigs from sound pigs with 100% sensitivity and specificity, which correlated well with subjective lameness scores. they may provide a future objective method to assess lameness and the effect of interventions on the presence of lameness.
