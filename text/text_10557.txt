BACKGROUND
administration of ketamine or other nmda receptor blocking drugs  <cit>  may bring with it both beneficial and problematic outcomes. ketamine's use as a dissociative anesthetic is well established in clinical practice  <cit>  and more recently, it has also been proposed as a neuroprotectant against hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in neonatal rats  <cit> . however, in adult animals, nmda receptor blockade is known to produce psychotomimetic side effects  <cit> , impair memory formation  <cit> , and may produce neurotoxicity  <cit> . this neurotoxicity is evidenced by vacuolization of cortical neurons  <cit>  and has also been linked to programmed cell death  during development  <cit> .

the toxic effects of nmda receptor blockade are apparently dependent on the dose of the drug, administration regimen, and the age of the animal treated. for example, vulnerability to mk-801-induced cortical vacuolization is not evident in fetal animals but rather begins at approximately the time of puberty  <cit> . on the other hand, apoptogenic effects of ketamine have been seen following drug administrations during the last trimester of pregnancy  <cit> . further, the selection of an acute or chronic dosing regimen may also modulate the neurobehavioral outcomes and the permanence of the neurological changes that can be expected  <cit> .

recent experiments from our laboratory have focused on age-dependent effects of a single dose of ketamine on fetal learning and memory. rat fetuses can learn conditioned taste aversions  and exhibit taste-mediated conditioned motor responses   <cit> , which can be modulated in complex ways by exposure to ketamine at different times during the perinatal period  <cit> . for example, ketamine will either cause a potentiation or a blockade of memory formation in rats, depending on the specific day during fetal development when the drug is administered. rat fetuses that receive ketamine on e <dig>  are able to learn and remember ctas and cmrs quite well. however, rat fetuses that receive ketamine before cta training just one day later, on e <dig>  exhibit an amnesia for these conditioned responses  <cit> . we have referred to this phenomenon as the "ketamine paradox"  <cit> .

these previous studies have only tested the durability of the ketamine paradox over a period of up to  <dig> weeks  <cit>  and have looked at a very narrow range of behavioral measures – all with gustatory components. however, there are some indications that early treatment with nmda receptor blocking drugs can have long-term behavioral implications. for example, neonatal treatment with mk- <dig> can produce long-lasting behavioral radioprotection in rats with x-ray-induced hippocampal damage  <cit> . likewise, maier et al.  <cit>  have reported that mk801-induced nmda receptor antagonism in young rats  extends the sparing of hindlimb function after spinal transection in older animals. however, treatment with an nmda receptor antagonist  for a longer time, later in neonatal development , impaired motor and cognitive behaviors in adult rats  <cit> . several questions remain. what is the range of behaviors that can be influenced by ketamine treatment during the perinatal period? how long lasting are the different behavioral effects of ketamine administered late in gestation?

the current study extends our original observations and reports how a single injection of ketamine on either e <dig> or e <dig> modulates spontaneous locomotor activity and performance in a water maze. we tested the rats as juveniles and then as young adults. our data suggest several age-dependent effects of early ketamine treatment – effects that depend on not only the length of time between drug administration and behavioral testing but also on the day in embryonic development when the nmda receptor antagonist was administered.

RESULTS
water maze
p <dig> water maze test
over the <dig> trials of the water maze test, subjects significantly reduced their latencies to mount the hidden platform  indicating the gradual learning of the maze. however, as figure 1a illustrates, the animals never gained real proficiency on this task. the latencies decreased most dramatically within the first  <dig> trials and therefore we undertook a more in-depth analysis of this portion of the study. we also noticed that, as the animals swam, they would sometimes stop and tread water against the side of the tank. therefore, we undertook an analysis of the stop time/trial during the first  <dig> water maze trials . the time spent treading water decreased significantly over the first  <dig> trials . there was also a significant drug effect indicating that ketamine-treated rats spent less time treading water than did saline-treated controls . this effect was independent of the age at which the rats received ketamine.

time spent treading water at the side of the tank may be interpreted as an alternative, futile, escape strategy and not necessarily as an indicator of learning the position of the hidden platform. subsequent analyses subtracted out stop-times in order to provide the most accurate portrayal of maze learning during the first  <dig> trials. with stop-time removed, the declining time-to-platform  and swimming distance  over the first  <dig> trials indicated a learning of the maze during this initial exposure to the apparatus. however the behavioral changes induced by drug or age manipulations were not statistically significant. the number of trials in which the rat failed to mount the platform within  <dig> seconds was not significantly different among the  <dig> treatment groups. likewise, swim speed did not decrease significantly over the first  <dig> maze trials indicating that the animals were not fatiguing as they undertook multiple swims.

once the rat mounted the hidden platform we timed how long the subject remained there before it was removed . an analysis of these data during the first  <dig> maze trials revealed neither a significant influence of subject age nor drug treatment.

p <dig> water maze test
an analysis of the second water maze test indicated that there was a significant reduction in time  to mount the hidden platform over the  <dig> trials . the analysis also revealed a significant age x drug interaction  but no significant main effects of drug or age at treatment. rats had previous experience with the maze  and inspection of the data indicated that, after the first trial, latencies in all groups converged and dropped dramatically. as in the p <dig> water maze analysis, stop times  during this first trial were significantly lower in ketamine-treated rats . a subsequent examination of the data excluded the time spent treading water in swim-time, swim-distance and swim-speed analyses. on the first trial , ketamine-treated rats found the platform significantly faster than saline controls  and swam shorter distances to do so . animals injected on e <dig> were generally quicker to find the platform  and swam more direct routes to the platform  than were animals injected on e <dig> 

post-hoc analyses indicated that rats treated with ketamine on e <dig> reached the hidden platform significantly faster and swam shorter distances than saline-treated controls as well as rats treated with ketamine on e <dig> . rats treated with ketamine  also exhibited significantly fewer failures to reach the hidden platform  than did saline control animals : ketamine-treated mean ± sem =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  failures/ <dig> trials; saline-treated mean ± sem =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  failures/ <dig> trials.

the short latencies to mount the platform cannot be attributed to faster swimming speeds. on the first, second and third water maze trials , p <dig> rats that were treated with ketamine on e <dig> did not swim significantly faster than any of the animals in the other treatment groups. for example, the swim speeds for trial  <dig> were: . fatigue did not seem to play a role in the group differences since swim speed remained stable in all groups over the first  <dig> water maze trials on p <dig> 

locomotion
a single ketamine treatment during the perinatal period had long-lasting effects on spontaneous locomotor movements. ketamine's effects depended on the age of behavioral testing as well as the age of the drug treatment. horizontal movements  were more prominently influenced by perinatal ketamine than were vertical movements .

p <dig> locomotor tests
p <dig> rats treated prenatally with ketamine showed habituation to the open-field test chamber and exhibited reduced horizontal movements overall . after being placed in the activity chamber, p <dig> rats decreased their horizontal movements  significantly over the 30-minute test session . in fact, locomotor activity of all treatment groups was reduced to very low levels  after the first  <dig> minutes .

ketamine-treated rats were also generally less active than saline-injected controls . however, there was a significant interaction between drug treatment and the block of time in which the locomotor measurement was made . at the end of  <dig> minutes, p <dig> rats reduced their spontaneous locomotion to approximately 20% of its original level. for this reason, we performed a minute-by-minute analysis of the first  <dig> minutes in the open field apparatus . once again, there was a significant decrease in horizontal movement over the first  <dig> minutes in the chamber . generally, ketamine treatment caused a significant decrease in line crossings as compared to saline-injected controls . a drug x time block interaction [f. there was not a significant difference in the spontaneous horizontal locomotor responses of e18- and e19-ketamine treated rats.

p <dig> locomotor tests
horizontal movements of ketamine-treated rats tested on p <dig> varied depending on when, during the fetal period, they had received the drug . as was the case during the p <dig> tests, horizontal movements decreased significantly over the 30-minute test . there was both an overall effect of subject age at time of drug injection  and a treatment age x drug interaction . over the course of this 30-minute test , e <dig> fetuses treated with ketamine were generally more active in their horizontal movements than were animals treated with saline on this day of embryonic development. further, rats exposed to ketamine on e <dig> exhibited significantly more horizontal movement than did e <dig> rats treated with either saline or ketamine. rats injected with saline on e <dig> or e <dig> did not exhibit significant differences in line crossings when tested on p <dig> 

an analysis that focused on the first 5-minutes of this p <dig> locomotor test  revealed a significant interaction between drug treatment and subject age at time of treatment . multiple comparisons revealed that rats treated with ketamine on e <dig> were more active than both e <dig> saline-control rats and e <dig> rats that received ketamine. these data reveal a very different pattern of horizontal locomotor responses exhibited by ketamine-treated rats depending on the day during fetal development that they received the drug. there were no significant group differences in rearing movements on p <dig> 

discussion
the data presented here suggest several age-dependent effects of early ketamine treatment – effects that depend on not only the day of behavioral testing but also the day in embryonic development when the nmda receptor antagonist was administered. during the initial stage of the second water maze test , rats treated with ketamine on e <dig> found the hidden platform more quickly than did animals receiving the same treatment on e <dig>  moreover, they exhibited enhanced maze performance compared to both groups of saline-treated rats. it is important to note that ketamine treatment on e <dig> did not induce faster swim speeds. rather, the animals swam more direct routes to the hidden platform.

effects of ketamine on spontaneous open-field locomotion were also age-dependent. in neonatal animals , ketamine administration in utero reduced subsequent spontaneous movement. this effect was subtle  and did not depend on the subject's age at the time of the drug's administration. however, when these animals were re-tested on p <dig>  the rats that received ketamine on e <dig> both moved more than the rats that received ketamine on e <dig> and also moved more than saline-injected controls.

first, these data reveal long-term behavioral effects of a single dose of ketamine administered in utero. drug-induced effects on water maze learning were observed over  <dig> weeks after birth and locomotor effects were documented  <dig> weeks post partum. these findings are consistent with others indicating that early nmda receptor blockade may produce behavioral alterations that are detectable in adulthood  <cit> . second, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the behavioral effects of nmda receptor blockade depend on the day in embryonic development when the antagonist is administered. in particular, some of the findings reported here extend our previous work indicating that ketamine treatment on e <dig> may have different effects than administration of the drug on e <dig>  <cit> . the same dose of ketamine administered in the current study potentiated conditioned motor responses of neonates if the drug had been given  on e <dig>  however, ketamine impaired acquisition of this learned response if it was administered one day later on e <dig>  <cit> . similar age-dependent effects have been reported using different behavioral indicators of learning  <cit> .

the effects of early ketamine treatment on locomotion are apparently not consistent throughout postnatal development. ketamine reduced locomotor movements in p <dig> rats but later  selectively enhanced locomotion of animals that received the drug on e <dig>  the reasons for this change in responding are unclear. in order to accommodate the different size of the animals at p <dig> and p <dig>  there were differences in the dimensions of the open field chambers used at each test. also, the chamber walls were clear during the p <dig> test and opaque at p <dig>  but beyond these differences in apparatus, maturation clearly brings with it a variety of capabilities and propensities many of which can modulate motor responding. for example, at the end of  <dig> minutes, p <dig> rats reduce their spontaneous locomotion to approximately 20% of its original level. however, p <dig> rats are 80% as active during this same time period. these data indicate a general tendency for young rats to habituate  more rapidly than older rats. other behavioral studies have revealed toxin-induced performance impairments that reveal themselves only at certain stages of early postnatal development but not at older ages  <cit> . more recently, beninger et al.  <cit>  reported that rats administered mk- <dig> on p <dig> and tested pre-  and post-pubertally  exhibited different locomotor responses to amphetamine depending on the time of the behavioral test.

our measures of swim speed may offer some insights regarding the relative motor capacities and motivation of our animals. swim speeds did not significantly differ between animals previously treated with ketamine or saline. likewise, fetal age at the time of the drug treatment did not influence speed of swimming. instead, rats reduced their latencies to mount the platform by swimming more-direct routes. thus, the water maze data reported here are less likely a reflection of the animal's capacity or motivation to get to the platform and more likely a reflection of learning ability.

it should be noted that water maze performance may be influenced by a number of factors beyond cognitive ability. for example, drug-induced alteration of visual acuity, motivation or motor capacities can alter performance of this task  <cit> . the literature suggests that early nmda receptor blockade may alter development of the visual system  <cit> . but measures of actual visual acuity following a single occurrence of nmda receptor blockade in the developing brain are lacking. the available data suggest that visual plasticity is more significantly altered by nmda receptor antagonism than are visual maps  <cit>  or neural activity per se  <cit> . our water maze procedures did not necessarily place demands on the rat's visual system. the location of the hidden platform was not changed from trial to trial or between the p <dig> and p <dig> tests. therefore, once the platform was located, our subjects could have adopted motor strategies to reach the goal on subsequent trials. although water maze performance is typically cited as an indicator of spatial learning, our paradigm does not eliminate the possibility that other types of learning may also be involved.

we used accepted statistical methods to avoid spurious inflation of sample size and to control for litter effects  <cit>  . however, due to constraints of resources, the small number of litters employed may have reduced our power to detect subtle differences in performance. thus, this report should be viewed as a conservative account of drug- and age-influenced changes in behavior.

it is worth noting that it was initial responding on the water maze and in the locomotor test chamber that was most sensitive to our fetal ketamine treatment. ketamine-treated rats exhibited significantly faster times to reach the hidden platform  – but only on the first trial. likewise, p <dig> rats treated with ketamine as fetuses, exhibited fewer locomotor movements than did saline controls – but only during the first  <dig> minutes of our test. our laboratory  <cit> , as well as other investigators  <cit>  have reported a role for nmda receptors in the determination of novelty. the current data seem to suggest that these effects may extend to various behavioral testing paradigms. moreover, since our tests were conducted weeks after fetal ketamine treatment, our data indicate the persistence of ketamine's effects on initial responding.

what neural, or other, mechanisms might subserve the behavioral phenomenon outlined here? nmda receptor populations and physiology are neither static nor mature during the perinatal period and blockade of these receptors during particular days of development may produce quite different effects  <cit> . for example, sircar  <cit>  has shown that the binding of  mk- <dig>  in synaptosomal membranes is differentially altered by glutamate  agonists during various periods of development. these data build on previous findings  <cit>  indicating a dramatic change in the number of pcp-binding sites in fetal rat brain between the ages of e <dig> and e <dig>  this is the same time frame in which ketamine's effects on memory change so significantly. could these developmentally linked changes in nmda receptor populations and functional roles mediate the ketamine paradox as well as the behavioral phenomena presented here?

the identification of several nmda receptor subtypes with different functional roles and different patterns of expression during the perinatal period may also eventually reveal aspects of the ketamine paradox's physiological substrate  <cit> . could a drug-induced change in the population and/or distribution of nmda receptor subtypes mediate the ketamine paradox as well as long-term behavioral effects? the current data do not address this point directly. however, nr2b nmda receptors   <cit>  have been identified as being especially sensitive to upregulation following pharmacological antagonism  <cit> . further, other laboratories have reported that nmda exposure can produce a reduction in nmda receptors within  <dig> hours of exposure  <cit> . our data suggest the potential usefulness of studies aimed at correlating ketamine-induced changes in nmda receptor subtype populations with behavioral outcomes recorded at several times in development. such experiments are currently underway in our laboratory.

it should also be noted that ketamine can influence maternal and fetal physiology in ways that go beyond the drug's well-known effects on nmda glutamate receptors  <cit> . pulmonary vasodilator responses have been recorded following ketamine administration  <cit> . the drug can also alter uterine tone in pregnant ewes by increasing cardiac output and mean arterial pressure  <cit> . although these cardiovascular effects were slight and transient, they may have contributed in yet-unknown ways to some of the long-term behavioral changes we report here. likewise, ketamine not only affects nmda receptors but may also inhibit non-nmda glutamate receptors  <cit> , the high-affinity states of the dopamine d <dig> receptor, and other g-protein-linked receptors  <cit> . while ketamine's actions on nmda receptors are certainly prominent, acute changes in vascular tone and the drug's actions on other brain receptors are capable of influencing fetal development in ways not addressed by the current experiments.

if early ketamine exposure influences nmda receptor populations or functioning, post-synaptic second messenger pathways would also be engaged as mediators of behavioral change  <cit> . downstream calcium and calmodulin signaling, calcium-dependent kinases, and ultimately changes in gene expression are known to produce synaptic restructuring  <cit> . this cascade of nmda-receptor-initiated biochemical events provides a likely avenue for further investigation as we examine the physiological substrate of the behavioral phenomena described here.

the variables of subject age and ketamine dose interact in complex ways to produce predictions of neurotoxicity. if nmda antagonists are used to suppress neuronal activity during a critical developmental period of synaptogenesis, the timing and sequence of synaptic connection is disrupted  <cit> . this causes neurons to receive an internal signal to commit suicide – a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis  <cit> . ketamine, and other nmda receptor blocking drugs, are reported to produce these neurotoxic effects  <cit>  under certain circumstances. in the rat, the period of brain sensitivity is largely confined to the postnatal period   <cit> . our single dose of ketamine was administered on either e <dig> or e <dig>  i.e., subject ages that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been systematically manipulated in studies aimed at investigating ketamine's ability to produce apoptosis. these studies should be done to confirm the role that apoptosis may/may not play in producing the long-term behavioral changes we report here.

in addition to subject age, the dose of ketamine is another important factor in determining the likelihood of apoptosis induction as well as the generalizability of our data to clinical settings. in order to produce an increase in apoptotic neurons in neonatal rats, ketamine must be administered in multiple injections over a period of  <dig> hours  <cit> . our study used a single dose of ketamine  that was significantly higher  that those used previously in neonates  <cit> . however, from previous biochemical studies we know that our dosing regimen in pregnant rats  <cit>  produced a concentration of fetal brain ketamine roughly comparable to that seen in blood following repeated doses of  <dig> mg/kg administered to neonatal rats   <cit> . these blood levels were approximately seven-fold greater than anesthetic blood levels in humans  <cit> . therefore, by extrapolation, we may predict that our dose of ketamine produced tissue levels of the drug that significantly exceeded those typically produced in human patients who encounter the drug in a clinical setting. of course, this does not eliminate the possibility that the human recreational use of ketamine   <cit>  may produce blood and brain levels that are significantly higher than those encountered in the clinic. nor does it exclude the possibility of differing drug sensitivities of rats and humans. both these factors will influence the clinical relevance of the studies reported here.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies were aimed at determining the long-term behavioral effects of ketamine administration on e <dig> and e <dig> as a means of assessing the durability, intensity and generalizability of the ketamine paradox  <cit> . our previous work indicated that ketamine administration enhanced the formation of a conditioned taste aversion in e <dig> fetuses but not those treated on e <dig> or later  <cit> . the current data reveal several subtle, but consistent, residual behavioral changes produced by of a single large dose of ketamine administered during the rat's late pre-natal period. in terms of ketamine effects on spontaneous locomotion, we found that, irrespective of the day of fetal dosing employed, ketamine reduced horizontal movements when animals were tested on p <dig>  however, when the animals were tested later, on p <dig>  rats that had received ketamine on e <dig> differentiated themselves from the e <dig> ketamine-treated animals  by exhibiting an increase in locomotion – especially in the early minutes of behavioral testing in the open field. ketamine's long-term influence on water maze learning/retention was limited in scope, but palpable, on the first trial of the p <dig> test.

despite the reliable enhancement of cta learning that has been reported in fetuses and neonates treated with ketamine on e <dig>  <cit> , this same dosing regimen produced limited improvements in learning/retention of a water maze when the animals were tested as young adults. the usefulness of ketamine as a cognitive enhancer, administered in the perinatal period, appears to be limited not only by its known toxic effects at critical stages of development  <cit>  but also by its influence on spontaneous movement and the drug's weak memory-enhancing properties over the long term.
