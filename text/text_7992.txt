BACKGROUND
mirnas are a class of short endogenous non-coding regulatory rnas whose length is approximately 22 nt. they modulate various biological processes, such as cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, development and homeostasis . they act by repressing translation or destabilizing target mrna, thereby providing an additional layer of control in gene regulatory networks  <cit> . in animals, a seed sequence is present at nucleotides 2– <dig> of the mature sequence and is a major determinant of mirna targeting specificity. mirnas sharing the same seed are considered to belong to the same family  <cit> . mirna genes generally locate in non-coding intergenic or intronic regions  <cit> , with some rare cases found in protein-coding regions  <cit> . the activity of mirna genes is often restricted to specific developmental stages or tissues, and their expression is sometimes only stimulated by environmental cues such as temperature  <cit> , oxidative  <cit> , salt or drought  <cit>  stresses. while high-throughput small rna sequencing   provides a powerful approach for mirna identification, their restricted expression makes it difficult to use this method to exhaustively survey mirnas in a given species. potential mirna genes can also be computationally predicted in whole genome sequences, and this could usefully complement mirna-seq approaches.

ascidians  have been used as model species in development biology for over a century  <cit> . these species offer attractive experimental features, including a compact genome , invariant embryonic cell lineages, small embryonic cell number, and translucent embryos, which allow the description of developmental processes with a cellular level of resolution. 15 years ago, the complete genome sequences of two ascidian species, ciona robusta  <cit>   and ciona savignyi  <cit>  were assembled, annotated and made publicly accessible through genome browsers  <cit> . since then, the genomes of additional tunicate species have been sequenced, partially annotated and publicly released , opening the way to a study of the evolution of ascidian coding and non-coding genetic elements. it is generally considered that ascidians are subject to rapid molecular evolution, in both coding and non-coding sequences  <cit> .

recently, many mirnas have been described in c. robusta and c. savignyi  . over  <dig> mirna candidates were predicted  <cit>  and the expression of  <dig> of them was experimentally detected in c. robusta by mirna-seq and microarray data  <cit> . some c. robusta mirnas control development processes  <cit> . for example, mir- <dig> promotes neuronal development via the inhibition of notch signaling  <cit> , while mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have muscle-specific functions, as in vertebrates.

in this study, we performed a comprehensive search for mirna in h. roretzi, an ascidian of a different order, the stolidobranchia, using a recently sequenced and annotated genome draft  <cit> . three major approaches were used to predict mirnas: conservation to mirna described in mirbase, de novo mirnas prediction, and similarity to ciona small rna-seq reads. a total of  <dig> mirna genes were discovered, whose evolutionary conservation was studied. this study thus advances our understanding of the complex gene regulatory network of ascidian embryos and will facilitate future developmental biology studies.

 <dig> mirbase metazoan mirnas are conserved in halocynthia and approximately half of them may be ascidian or tunicate-specific
to survey the repertoire of mirnas in h. roretzi, we first carried out a blastn similarity search  in the h. roretzi genome, using as input all known mature metazoan mirnas deposited in mirbase   <cit> . we further selected mirna candidates whose flanking genome sequences passed our filtration criteria on the stem-loop structure and minimum folding free energy  . this identified  <dig> candidate h. roretzi mirna precursors, belonging to  <dig> known mirna families . figure  <dig> shows the stem loops formed by genomic sequences flanking a selection of predicted h. roretzi mirnas.fig.  <dig> phylogenic survey of the conserved h. roretzi mirnas in other species. red squares indicate that the mirna exists in the corresponding species, light blue square indicates that the mirnas has not been reported in the species.  <dig> highly conserved families , mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-1473) that were detected in c. robusta were not found in h. roretzi via our method. these mirnas may exist in h. roretzi, without satisfying the stringent filtering criteria we applied. alternatively, they may have been lost in the h. roretzi lineage. see details of species names in additional file 2

the phylogenetic distribution of these h. roretzi  <dig> mirna families in mirbase was next examined .  <dig> families were highly conserved across metazoa, including let- <dig> and mir- <dig> to - <dig> . of these,  <dig> families were found in both deuterostomes and protostomes and may thus represent ancestral metazoan mirnas. seven families were exclusively found in deuterostomes, in either only chordates  or in both chordates and ambulacraria. we attribute the absence of mir- <dig> from ciona and oikopleura to the possible restricted expression of this mirna, which may have precluded its identification by mirna-seq. interestingly, an ancestral metazoan mirna, mir- <dig>  appears to have been specifically lost from the vertebrate lineage, as it is present in all surveyed tunicates, amphioxus, and protostomes. the loss in echinoderms is not clear, since the number of species is only three.

twenty one families were found in the distantly related c. robusta and h. roretzi ascidians but not in other animals , and may thus correspond to ascidian or tunicate-specific mirnas. these mirnas are all represented by at least  <dig> reads in the ciona small rna sequencing dataset  <cit>  , suggesting that they are expressed during c. robusta embryogenesis and are therefore likely to be genuine mirnas. finally, three mirna families, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were only found in h. roretzi and a single non-tunicate species . our confidence in the predictions of these mirnas is more limited.

to test whether the small number of candidate halocynthia mirnas conserved across metazoa reflected a low sensitivity in our identification method, or the overall weak conservation of ascidian mirnas, we checked the situation in c. robusta. a total of  <dig> c. robusta mirnas, belonging to  <dig> families, were previously identified and deposited in mirbase. these mirnas were predicted from mirna-seq data collected from ciona embryos at the gastrula and larval stages, using the mirtrap computational program  <cit> , a method that makes no hypothesis on the evolutionary conservation of these candidates. of these  <dig> mirnas, only  <dig> mirnas, belonging to  <dig> families, were widely conserved in many non-tunicate metazoan species . an additional six mirnas  belonging to three families were found in at least one tunicate species other than c. robusta . mirna candidate cirobu-mir- <dig> was also found in rattus norvegicus. the remaining  <dig> c. robusta candidate mirnas  appeared to be specific for c. robusta.

the evolutionary analysis of these ciona mirnas, and the small number of halocynthia candidate mirna detected by conservation to mirbase entries suggest that a majority of ascidian mirnas may be either ascidian or tunicate-specific. discriminating between these two possibilities is currently difficult as the number of mirna reported so far in the non-ascidian tunicate oikopleura dioica  are small, suggesting that the list could be far from complete. similarly, the current repertoire of ciona savignyi mirna  is incomplete, explaining the small number of the mirnas for this species listed in fig.  <dig> 

de novo mirnas prediction
to extend our study of the halocynthia mirna repertoire, we next used srnaloop  <cit> , to detect potential mirna precursors on the sole basis of the presence of a canonical stem-loop structure  <cit> . genomic sequences that met minimum folding free energy  and stem-loop structure filtration criteria were considered as potential novel mirna precursors. clustering of these candidate sequences using cd-hit   <cit>  identified some clusters with high similarity. some of these clustered sequences were mapped to repeated sequences, which could form palindromes and confound srnaloop. these sequences were excluded from the final predictions. this approach predicted  <dig> mirna candidates including  <dig> that were found in the previous section . these novel candidates showed no significant hit by blastx  with proteins in nr and uniprotkb/swiss-prot database confirming that they are non-coding rnas.fig.  <dig> numbers of mirnas predicted by three different methods. numbers of mirnas that were found in this study are presented in the venn diagram. there is significant overlap between mirnas that were found by the three kinds of approaches




mirna precursors are transcribed from only one of the double-stranded dna template. which strand the mirna precursors originated from was inferred in  <dig> cases from published transcript information . prediction of the mature mirna sequences for de novo predicted mirnas is difficult and moderately reliable as the precise mechanism by which dicer cuts mirnas from the hairpin structure remains unknown. li et al  <cit>  reported an inference method for mature mirna locations by supposing that dicer precisely cuts the mature mirna at the loop-stem junction. we note, however, that the majority of mirbase mirnas do not obey this rule. furthermore, 5p and 3p mirnas are localized to the two parallel arms of the hairpin structure, and are not exactly complementary in sequence . so we tentatively predict the positions of 5p and 3p mirnas by detecting paired segments using patscan although we do not know which of 5p and/or 3p is the actual mirna  <cit> . for those precursors, in which patscan failed to find the paired sequences, a modified li’s method was used to find the 5p and 3p segments. the sequence of predicted mature mirnas are presented in fig. 4a and b.fig.  <dig> stem-loop structure of some novel mirnas genes. a mirnas detected with high abundance  in c. robusta small rna-seq data. b mirnas observed with low abundance  in small rna-seq data. red upper-case letters indicate inferred mature mirna sequences




analysis of c. robusta small rna-seq data confirms de novo mirna predictions
as the first test of our de novo predictions of halocynthia mirnas, we next made use of a previously generated set of c. robusta small rna-seq reads  <cit> . these reads, which are enriched in mirnas, but could also include other classes of small non-coding rnas  <cit> , were mapped onto the h. roretzi reference genome using blastn , and hits flanked by sequences whose minimum folding free energy  and stem-loop structure passed our filtration criteria were selected for further analysis . this identified  <dig> novel candidate mirnas. remarkably this set included  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate mirna predicted by our de novo approach, of which  <dig> were also detected using mirbase data . figure 4a shows the stem-loop structures of a selection of these novel mirna genes, with high small rna-seq reads  support. figure 4b showed stem-loop structures of mirna genes with weak small rna-seq reads  support, which represents low confidence predictions. the mature sequences of these h. roretzi mirnas were inferred via the matched position of c. robusta small rna-seq reads .

interestingly mature mirna sequences appear to have diverged significantly between ciona and halocynthia. of the  <dig> novel predicted mature h. roretzi mirnas , hrore-mir- <dig> was the only one with less than two mismatches to the  <dig> c. robusta mature mirnas predicted by keshavan et al.  <cit> . when four mismatches were allowed, only five hits were detected, harore-mir- <dig> , harore-mir- <dig> , harore-mir-5154_5p , harore-mir- <dig> , and harore-mir- <dig> .

in addition to  <dig> c. robusta mature mirnas, we reexamined whether the  <dig> novel halocynthia mirnas have homologues in the entire c. robusta genome . when two mismatches were allowed in the mature sequences, 168 h. roretzi mirnas were found to have a homolog in the c. robusta genome . when four mismatches were accepted, however,  <dig> out of  <dig>  h. roretzi mirnas were found to have a homolog in the c. robusta genome and  <dig>  of these  <dig> precursors could form canonical stem-loops when the temperature parameters of rnafold were adjusted to 18 °c  <cit>  . we have analyzed positions of the mismatches.  <dig> % occurred in seed region  and  <dig> % occurred outside of the seed region, suggesting that mismatches distribute evenly over entire mirnas as base number of seed region is only six out of 20– <dig> nucleotide. these results suggest that, although the sequences of mature ascidian mirnas may diverge rapidly, c. robusta and h. roretzi may share more homologous mirnas than expected from the results of the previous section.

the union of the mirnas predicted by all approaches consists of  <dig> candidate mirnas in the halocynthia genome:  <dig> well-conserved mirnas,  <dig> de novo predicted mirnas and  <dig> additionally predicted from ciona small rna-seq data. these predictions largely overlap .

validation of potential mirnas prediction
expression of some of the predicted mirnas was validated by rt-pcr using embryonic rna. the primers used are listed in additional file  <dig>  rna from mixed stages of embryogenesis was purified. in total,  <dig> mirna candidates were tested, and bands of adequate size were detected for  <dig> mirnas . sequencing of these  <dig> pcr bands confirmed their identity. no bands were amplified in rt negative samples. in the  <dig> well-conserved mirnas , mir-92a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> showed clear bands of ~40 bp . we also examined  <dig> potential mirnas that were predicted de novo and from c. robusta small rna-seq reads . mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> showed a clear band at ~40 bp. in addition, we found that the faint bands of mir- <dig> and  <dig> in fig. 5b also contained the expected sequences. three mirnas in mirbase that are conserved only between h. roretzi and c. robusta  gave clear bands . these results indicate the embryonic expression of at least half of predicted mirnas. the other predicted mirnas may either correspond to artefactual prediction, or not have been amplified because the position of their predicted mature sequence may be erroneous resulting in inadequate primer choice, or because these mirnas are not expressed during embryogenesis.fig.  <dig> rt-pcr validation of mirnas. a rt-pcr results of some well-conserved mirnas listed in table  <dig>  b rt-pcr validation of some potential mirnas that were predicted de novo and by using c. robusta small rna-seq reads. c ascidian or tunicate-specific mirnas . ‘ + ’ indicates pcr with reverse transcriptase; ‘-’ indicates pcr without reverse transcriptase. the expected size of the amplified fragment is ~40 bp  because the 19 bp universal primer is amplified together with ~20 bp mirna-specific primers. other bands would be non-specific bands




potential target prediction of the mirnas
to get insight into the functions of the mirnas, 3′ utr sequences were extracted from each gene model in aniseed  <cit>  . then, targets were tentatively predicted. a total of  <dig> possible target sites in putative 3′ utr sequences, which correspond to 17% of coding genes , were detected for  <dig> mirnas. among those,  <dig> target genes of  <dig> mirnas have gene ontology  terms associated with various development processes. although the functional validation of these targets goes beyond the scope of this article and these targets have not been functionally validated, information on their identity, provided as a list in additional file  <dig>  may be useful for future studies of mirna functions.

discussion
compared to high-throughput small rna sequencing, computational mirna discovery approaches offer several advantages when reference genome sequence is available. first, they do not need the availability of small rna-seq. second, it could in theory discover all possible mirnas, while small rna sequencing can only identify mirnas expressed in the cells, tissues, organs, from which the rna was collected. this is particularly useful as some mirnas are only expressed in response to stresses, such as hyper-salinity, hyper osmotic pressure and disease. on the other hand, the disadvantage of computational predictions is that no direct experimental support of the predicted mirnas is provided until their expression is validated via rt-pcr or small rna-seq.

in this study, the repertoire of mirnas in the h. roretzi genome was investigated by bioinformatics methods  using three methods: homology search using mature mirnas sequences deposited in mirbase , de novo mirnas prediction using srnaloop , and prediction based on sequence similarity with c. robusta small rna-seq data . we found  <dig> conserved mirnas,  <dig> additional mirnas predicted by srnaloop, and another non-overlapping set of  <dig> mirnas using c. robusta small rna-seq data.  <dig> conserved mirnas were predicted by all three methods, a significant overlap supporting the reliability of the methods used in the present study.

these mirnas sum up to  <dig> in total, a lower number than described in ciona  <cit> , suggesting that our repertoire may be incomplete. to estimate the proportion of undiscovered mirnas, we investigated how many metazoan mirna precursors deposited in the mirbase would pass our selection criteria used in this study in terms of precursor length, loop number, mfe, gc content, and precursor base pairing situation as shown below. nucleotide lengths of  <dig> % precursors are between  <dig> and 130 bp ,  <dig> % precursors have only one loop ,  <dig> % precursors’ minimum folding free energy  ≤ - <dig>  * l +  <dig>  ,  <dig> % precursors’ gc content are between  <dig> and 70% ,  <dig> % precursors have more than 55% paired bases . despite the individual recovery rate are pretty high, however, only  <dig> % mirnas passed all of these criteria. therefore, roughly 32% of mirnas could not pass our criteria and still to be discovered in h. roretzi.fig.  <dig> criterions that were used in this study and its evaluation by application to metazoan mirna precursors. a precursor length distribution and their percent of metazoan mirna precursors that are registered in mirbase. b loop number per precursor. loop number was predicted by rnafold. c relationship of mfe and precursor length. mfe was calculated by rnafold. red line indicates the equation simulated via linear regression analysis. black line represents the equation with the shifted constant used in this study, and it allowed ~ <dig> % precursors to pass the criterion, mfe ≤ - <dig>  * l +  <dig> . d gc content distribution. e paired bases per precursor. paired bases per precursor were obtained by rnafold 
RESULTS




thirty two  of  <dig> mirnas  are well-conserved mirnas over several phyla, and  <dig>  are shared only with c. robusta. in addition,  <dig> novel mirnas of h. roretzi were predicted.  <dig> of these may correspond to genuine mirnas in c. robusta. therefore, 20%  mirnas may correspond to ascidian/tunicate-specific mirnas shared between h. roretzi  and c. robusta , although this estimation is still rough. the situation is similar in c. robusta. we checked the  <dig> previously identified mirnas in c. robusta that are deposited in mirbase  <cit>  and found that only  <dig> of them are well-conserved mirnas over phyla. therefore, it seems that ascidian species have small number of widely conserved mirnas, and a larger number of ascidian/tunicate-specific mirnas. these results are consistent with the general conjecture that animal mirnas are not well conserved between distant taxa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
mirnas play crucial roles in the modulation of developmental processes as well as response to environment stresses, but little is known about their functions in the tunicate species. we reported potential h. roretzi mirnas inferred from the genome sequence, and showed that only a small number of mirnas were conserved across phyla. most mirnas were newly discovered in this study. our study suggested the possibility that many mirnas could be conserved among ascidian species. this finding would hopefully facilitate future studies of gene regulation by mirnas.
