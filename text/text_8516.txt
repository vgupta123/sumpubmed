BACKGROUND
mrna decay is known to play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria. studies in escherichia coli indicated a possible model, in which the endoribonuclease rnase e binds and cuts the mrna, followed by rnase ii and/or pnpase that degrade the fragments generated by rnase e cleavage  <cit> . the accessibility of the 5' end of an mrna to rnase e has been shown to be an important mediator of stability in e. coli  <cit> .

much less is known about mrna decay in other bacteria, particularly in gram positive species. several studies, performed in bacillus subtilis and bacillus thuringiensis, indicated that the 5' terminal leader sequence has a relevant role in mrna stabilization, either by containing a polypurine rich sequence or by the presence of a predicted 5'-terminal stem-loop structure  <cit> . extensive mutagenesis was used to define how these two motifs influence mrna stability and the presence of an rnase e-like ribonuclease, acting on the 5' end, has been suggested. its action may be blocked by either the stem-loop structure and/or ribosomes located in proximity of the 5' terminus of the transcript  <cit> .

in mycobacteria few examples of mrnas stability control have been described  <cit> . the most interesting is the stability of the dna gyrase mrna in mycobacterium smegmatis, which is 5' protected by a stem-loop structure, followed by a shine-dalgarno sequence for translation initiation. disruption of the stem-loop caused loss of transcript stability  <cit> .

in this work we report that the mycobacterial katg mrna originates from specific processing of the longer bicistronic transcript, covering fura and katg. the katg mrna encodes the catalase-peroxidase, responsible for the degradation of toxic oxygen compounds. in all studied mycobacterial species, the dna region immediately upstream of katg encodes fura  <cit> . fur-like proteins are ubiquitous in bacteria, and act as transcriptional repressors that exhibit an iron-dependent dna binding activity and regulate several genes involved in iron metabolism  <cit> . in mycobacteria this role is not achieved by fura, but by the iron dependent transcription regulator  which plays a critical role in maintaining the intracellular iron homeostasis  <cit> .

in recent years, genes directly or indirectly controlled by fur-like proteins have been discovered, leading to the hypothesis that fur proteins have a wider role in bacterial gene expression  <cit> .

in mycobacteria, the organization of the fura-katg region is conserved, suggesting that it may constitute a single operon  <cit> . this hypothesis was confirmed by identification of a single fura-katg transcript in mycobacterium bovis bcg  <cit> . in apparent contrast, two different 5' ends were identified by s <dig> mapping: the first coincides with the initiation codon of fura and is generated by transcription initiation at the fura promoter ; the second is  <dig> bp upstream of katg translation start codon. master et al.  <cit>  proposed that a katg promoter was present in this region .

in m. smegmatis specific transcripts for fura and katg were identified by northern blotting, but a single transcript encompassing both fura and katg genes was not detected  <cit> . specific 5' ends were mapped by primer extension analysis  <cit> : the first  was due to transcription initiation from the fura promoter; two additional 5' ends were mapped upstream of katg, the first one, corresponding to coordinate  <dig>  falls in the terminal part of the fura gene; the second is less intense and corresponds to coordinate  <dig>  located in the fura-katg intergenic region. no specific promoter sequences were identified upstream of either  <dig> or  <dig> 

in this work we addressed the question whether the katg 5' ends were generated by transcription initiation or by mrna processing. our results support the latter alternative. furthermore, a polypurine sequence and translation initiation are both involved in katg mrna stability.

RESULTS
the 5' end of katg mrna is not generated by initiation of transcription
in a previous work, milano et al.  <cit>  reported the presence of a promoter region for katg expression in m. smegmatis, located in the terminal part of the upstream fura gene. in order to demonstrate the presence of this promoter, we amplified the m. smegmatis region that overlaps the 5' ends upstream of katg  and cloned it in plasmid pmv <dig>  substituting the hsp <dig> promoter region . in vitro transcription was performed in the presence of ctp and m. smegmatis cell extract, comparing the transcripts synthesized by pmv <dig>  from the constitutive hsp <dig> promoter, and pmys <dig>  from the potential katg promoter . pmv <dig> produced an rna of about  <dig> nt that may represent the rna starting from the hsp <dig> promoter and terminating at the transcription terminator downstream. on the contrary, no transcript of the expected size for an mrna starting at the hypothetical pkatg and terminating at the transcription terminator  was detected when pmys <dig> was used, suggesting that no promoter was present in this region. this data is in agreement with the absence of any promoter consensus sequences upstream of the 5' ends.

in order to exclude that a katg promoter was present in this region, we performed an rna polymerase chromatin immunoprecipitation assay  on m. smegmatis mc <dig>  after rifampicin treatment in order to block rna polymerase on promoter sequences  <cit> , formaldehyde cross-linking, and sonication, the dna-rna polymerase complexes were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to the β subunit of e. coli rna polymerase, as described in the methods section. as rifampicin inhibits transcript elongation, we expected rna polymerase to be trapped at any potential promoter. the precipitated dna was then analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr to determine the amount of recovered dna.

specific oligonucleotides were used to amplify different 150– <dig> bp dna fragments of the fura-katg region . the amplified regions with the indication of the ratio relative to the amount of the fragment containing the pfura promoter  are reported in fig.  <dig>  compared to fragment b, all the other regions were recovered with low frequency: in particular, the region where the potential katg promoter had previously been located  was recovered with a relative value of  <dig> . thus, we concluded that a promoter was not present in this region and that the katg mrna 5' end was produced by processing of a longer transcript.

the polypurine sequence preceding the katg start codon stabilizes the downstream transcript
in bacillus subtilis and bacillus thuringiensis polypurine sequences  in the 5' terminal part of several transcripts were reported to increase mrna stability  <cit> . by sequence analysis of the region immediately upstream of katg in m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis we identified a pps four bases upstream of the katg translation start codon . we tested whether the pps in the mycobacterial katg mrna was also able to stabilize the transcript.

an integrative plasmid was constructed, pmys <dig>  that carries the m. smegmatis siga promoter  <cit>  upstream of the lacz reporter . then, either the 437– <dig> region of m. smegmatis  or the 405– <dig> region of m. tuberculosis  were cloned between the siga promoter and the lacz gene. these regions cover the terminal part of the fura gene, the fura-katg intergenic region with the wild type pps and the first codons of katg . two mutant plasmids were also constructed, in which the pps sequence was mutagenized .

m. smegmatis mc <dig> was transformed, and beta-galactosidase activity measured. as reported in fig. 4a, beta-galactosidase activity expressed by pmys <dig> was increased  <dig> -fold in pmys <dig> and  <dig> -fold in pmyt <dig>  which carry the wild type pps. on the contrary, beta-galactosidase expressed from pmys <dig> and pmyt <dig>  carrying the mutated pps, did not change significantly compared to the control pmys <dig> .

furthermore, we measured the half-life of lacz mrna from the plasmids carrying m. smegmatis fragments. the mc <dig> strains carrying pmys694/690/ <dig> were treated with rifampicin  to block transcription and the rnas were extracted from the cultures at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> minutes after the addition of the antibiotic. quantitative rt-pcr was performed in order to measure the amount of rna at the different time points and to evaluate the half lives in the three strains. the half life of the lacz mrna was increased from  <dig>  minutes in pmys <dig> to  <dig>  minutes in pmys <dig> , whereas no substantial increase was observed in pmys <dig>  which carries the mutated pps. these results suggest that the identified pps is able to stabilize the katg-lacz mrna. moreover, we observed a good correlation between the beta-galactosidase activity and the lacz mrna stability.

primer extension analysis was performed on the rna extracted from mc <dig> and  . two bands were detected in pmys690: one corresponding to the previously mapped 5' end of siga  <cit> , and the other corresponding to the 5' end of katg  in m. smegmatis. the band at  <dig> appears very strong, in accordance with the stabilizing effect of the downstream pps. the two signals were also present in pmys <dig>  but in this case the  <dig> band was visibly fainter, according to the decreased stability caused by the mutated pps.

relevance of translation in katg mrna stability
in other gram positive bacteria it has been shown that ribosome binding and ternary complex formation are responsible for the pps mediated stability, whereas translation appears not to be involved  <cit> . on the other hand, in many e. coli rnas translation seems to contribute directly to transcript stability  <cit> .

in order to evaluate the role of translation in increasing mrna stability in our system, we constructed several plasmids in which dna fragments of m. smegmatis were inserted in pmys <dig> between the siga promoter and the lacz reporter gene . pmys <dig> carries an m. smegmatis region that starts from coordinate  <dig> and extends to the first  <dig> codons of katg, followed by a translation stop codon . pmys <dig> carries the same dna fragment, but the katg translation start codon was mutagenized to ccg.

in all these constructs translation of the downstream lacz gene proceeds independently, by ribosome binding to the lacz ribosome binding site and starting translation from its atg start codon. thus, beta-galactosidase activity and the stability of the lacz transcript can be compared in the different constructs.

both the amount of beta-galactosidase and of lacz transcript were increased more than  <dig> fold in pmys <dig> compared to pmys <dig>  whereas in pmys <dig> relative expression was even lower than in the control. these results suggest that, beside the pps, translation of the katg open reading frame is also directly involved in transcript stability.

other plasmids were constructed in which the length of the katg open reading frame was varied: in pmys <dig> a stop codon substitutes the katg start codon ; in pmys <dig> and pmys <dig> the translation stop codon is located after  <dig> and  <dig> codons, respectively. we measured beta-galactosidase activity as an indication of the lacz mrna stability. pmys <dig> expressed beta-galactosidase activity to a level similar to the pmys <dig> control, confirming the relevance of translation for transcript stability. an increased expression of beta-galactosidase could be observed in pmys <dig> and in pmys <dig>  in which translation can proceed for  <dig> and  <dig> codons, respectively. these data indicate that translation of about twenty or more codons is necessary for achieving full transcript stability.

a single stranded mrna region is necessary for the correct processing of the katg mrna
to characterize the requirements for the processing of the katg mrna 5' end, several plasmids were constructed by insertion of m. smegmatis dna regions from  <dig> to  <dig>  downstream of psiga: pmys <dig> carries the wild type sequence, pmys <dig> carries a  <dig> bp internal deletion , in pmys <dig> five bp flanking the processing site have been substituted, and in pmys <dig> five bp were substituted in order to allow the formation of a double stranded region corresponding to the processing site . for each plasmid the predicted structure of the rna from siga is reported in fig.  <dig>  rnas were extracted from mc <dig> strain transformed with the plasmids and primer extension was performed with oligo  <dig>  internal to the downstream lacz gene. the results indicated that in the wild type pmys <dig> two signals were detectable: one corresponding to the 5' end due to siga, the second corresponding to the processing site at  <dig>  the only small effect of the  <dig> bp deletion in pmys <dig> was the presence of a double signal at  <dig> and  <dig>  the transcript of pmys <dig>  which carries a different sequence around the processing site, is normally processed at  <dig>  whereas the transcript of pmys <dig>  in which a double stranded region is created, was no more correctly processed. in order to confirm that a double stranded rna around  <dig> could not be processed, we constructed an other plasmid in which different bases were substituted in order to create a double stranded rna, and also in this case processing at  <dig> did not occur . these data indicate that the ribonuclease responsible for the processing needs a single stranded rna region for cutting.

discussion
the 5' end of the katg transcript in m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis is a processing site
in a previous work  <cit>  we suggested the presence of a promoter for m. smegmatis katg expression in the terminal part of the fura gene and we identified two 5' ends at coordinate  <dig> and  <dig>  however, in this work we tried without success to use the cloned fragment for in vitro transcription: no rna could be produced by pmys <dig>  in which the m. smegmatis 437– <dig> region has been cloned. moreover, neither promoter consensus sequences were present upstream of  <dig> nor this region could be recovered by rna-polymerase chip assays. thus, we concluded that the 5' end is not due to transcription initiation rather to processing of a longer transcript.

in m. tuberculosis a longer transcript, starting from pfura, has been observed  <cit> . in m. smegmatis we were unable to detect a polycistronic fura-katg transcript by rt-pcr experiments  <cit> . this suggests that immediate processing may follow fura-katg transcript synthesis in m. smegmatis.

in the constructs in which the siga promoter region has been cloned immediately upstream of the m. smegmatis fragment , we could demonstrate the presence of a longer rna, starting at psiga. primer extension analysis also revealed the presence of a 5' end at  <dig>  that is the same position in which the m. smegmatis fura-katg mrna is cut. however, no primer extension signal was observed at  <dig>  in fact, this latter 5' end was no longer detected in many primer extension experiments performed with rnas extracted from mc <dig> . we suggest that this signal, always less intense than the 5' end at  <dig>  may arise by specific pausing of the reverse transcriptase.

role of a polypurine sequence in katg mrna stability
by cloning downstream of the siga promoter the m. tuberculosis or the m. smegmatis regions that cover the katg gene translation start point, beta-galactosidase expression and lacz mrna half life were increased more than threefold. these regions contain a pps four bp upstream of the katg translation start codon. mutagenesis of the pps abolished both effects, thus suggesting the central role of this sequence in transcript stability.

the complementarity of the pps to the 16s rrna sequence  indicates that it could act as the katg ribosome binding site. mutations altering the complementarity to the 16s rrna decreased the amount of the lacz transcript, suggesting that ribosome binding protects the rna from degradation.

the role of ribosome binding sites in mrna stabilization has been demonstrated in many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it was shown that many mrnas, like lacz and ompa of e. coli  <cit> , apre, gsib and ermc of b. subtilis  <cit> , cryiiia of b. thuringiensis  <cit> , can be significantly destabilized by mutations in the ribosome binding site that interfere with ribosome binding by reducing its complementarity to 16s rrna.

this is the first example in mycobacteria, in which a polypurine rich sequence is able to confer stability to the downstream rna likely by ribosome binding.

translation is required for stabilization
most examples of mrna stability mechanisms derived from gram-positive bacteria seem to depend on ribosome binding, but not on translation  <cit> . on the other hand, several examples in e. coli indicate that translation has also a role  <cit> .

we could demonstrate that in our mycobacterial system translation is required for stabilization, and more than  <dig> codons are needed for conferring full stability to the transcript. thus, we suggest that the ribonuclease that processes the transcript is impaired both by ribosome bound to the pps and by translation of the first part of katg.

regulation of katg expression and processing of the katg transcript
in previous works  <cit> , by means of two different reporter systems, katg expression was suggested to be originated from specific transcription initiation. considering our new findings, indicating the absence of any promoter and the presence of a stabilizing sequence upstream of the katg start codon, a new explanation should be given to previous results. we hypothesize that the reporter activity could be explained by the presence of an unknown promoter upstream of the cloning site in the vector sequence. transcription starting from this promoter may produce a transcript that, upon processing at  <dig>  is stabilized by both the polypurine sequence and translation initiation. this led to the expression of the downstream reporter gene. thus, a reporter gene assay, usually used to identify promoter sequences, led us to detect an rna stabilizing sequence.

therefore, in agreement with what has been suggested by pym et al.  <cit> , in m. tuberculosis and in m. smegmatis transcription of the katg gene may originate from the upstream pfura promoter. a single transcript containing fura and katg is synthesized and processed to originate two different transcripts, one covering fura, the second covering katg. the latter is stabilized by the pps and translation of the first codons of katg. in conclusion, expression of katg appears to be under the direct control of the fura protein that controls transcription initiation at pfura  <cit> .

although the transcript is processed both in m. tuberculosis and in m. smegmatis, the efficiency of the processing event differs. this may be the consequence of a better substrate in m. smegmatis and/or a more active rnase. it would be possible to replace the m. smegmatis fura-katg intergenic region by the corresponding m. tuberculosis region and test whether a single mrna for both genes can be found. if this occurs, one can conclude that the substrate makes the difference. on the contrary, if the transcript is completely processed, m. smegmatis rnase is more active.

the secondary structure of the transcripts covering the m. smegmatis fura-katg region were obtained by mfold-structure prediction program of zuker  <cit> . the structure of the region surrounding the processing sites is single stranded both in the transcripts starting at the fura promoter  and in the rnas starting at psiga . moreover, mutagenesis of this region, either by deletion of about  <dig> bp or by substitution of the bases surrounding the processing site did not prevent processing at  <dig>  on the contrary, a double stranded rna region impaired the processing, suggesting that the rnase involved in the processing of the fura-katg transcript requires single stranded rna.

several endoribonucleases have been identified in m. tuberculosis and in m. smegmatis complete genome sequence by homology with known enzymes in other bacteria  <cit> . experiments are in progress to identify which mycobacterial ribonuclease is responsible for this processing.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first reported case in mycobacteria, in which both a polypurine sequence and translation initiation are shown to contribute to mrna stability. the fura-katg mrna is transcribed from the fura promoter and likely processed by a single stranded rnase.
