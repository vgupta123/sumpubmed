BACKGROUND
genetic resistance to the white pine blister rust  fungus  in western white pine  and other five-needle pines is an important and highly desired trait. introduced to north america in the early 1900s, c. ribicola has decimated native white pines and significantly altered both forest ecosystems and the ability to manage the species for profitable timber production. white pine breeding and subsequent use of resistant germplasm for forest restoration is a long-term process; since the 1940s, it has required the attention of a few generations of forest geneticists  <cit> .

several types of dna markers such as amplified fragment-length polymorphism  markers  <cit> , single nucleotide polymorphism  markers  <cit>  and microsatellite  markers  <cit>  have been developed and applied to wwp research, and there is some molecular information is available for molecular breeding of white pine resistance against c. ribicola <cit> . for example, the plant disease resistance  family of nbs-lrr proteins and several families of pathogenesis-related  proteins, including chitinases , thaumatin like proteins -tlps , intracellular ribonuclease-like proteins , and anti-microbial peptides/proteins , have been shown to contribute to host resistance in wp-br interactions  <cit> . a recent proteomic profiling uncovered over one hundred p. monticola proteins modulated by c. ribicola inoculation, which included heat shock proteins , reactive oxygen species  scavenging enzymes, and intermediate factors functioning in the signal transduction pathways triggered by well-known plant r genes, as well as other defence-related proteins  <cit> . histochemical analysis revealed that the resistance response to systemic c. ribicola spread is localized internally in needle and stem tissues and that the build-up of physical barriers and deposition of cell wall-bound phenolic compounds play a crucial role in the defense reaction  <cit> . despite these important results, there is still much to learn about the genetic basis of host resistance to c. ribicola in wwp and other five-needle pines .

even though there have been significant improvements in genomic sequencing techniques over the past decade, the full genome of a conifer species is still unavailable. as a group, white pines have one of the largest plant genomes   <cit> ; the genome size of p. monticola is estimated at  <dig>  pg/c with a calculated length of about  <dig> ?×? <dig> mb per 1c genome. full genome sequencing of any single white pine species would thus be very expensive. rna sequencing  is a recently developed, high-throughput method for profiling transcriptomes. rna-seq is cost-economic and time-saving, especially compared to traditional expressed sequence tag  sequencing, and it can generate transcriptome data for non-model species using incomplete genome information  <cit> . in addition to profiling gene expression, rna-seq has shown powerful applications in areas, such as cataloguing of non-coding rnas, investigation of the transcriptional structure of genes and splicing patterns, and the study of posttranscriptional modification and mutations  <cit> . rna-seq has also provided information on complex regulation networks for gene expression patterns and on gene variations  in an increasing number of non-model plants  <cit> , but, to date has not been used in study of the wpbr pathosystem.

in this study, we used rna-seq analysis to profile the transcriptome of p. monticola primary needles during early stages of infection by c. ribicola; seedlings with major gene resistant  and susceptible  genotypes were used. with de novo assembly followed by gene annotation and functional classification, our rna-seq analysis generated the first p. monticola consensus transcriptome. comparison of rna-seq data sets from resistant  and susceptible  genotypes revealed significant expressional differences among genes involved in defense signalling pathways and metabolic pathways. the first-ever set of transcriptome and global gene expression data reported here on c. ribicola-infected white pine needles significantly expands our knowledge of the molecular framework of the wpbr pathosystem.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing by rna-seq and de novo assembly
three rna-seq 76-bp paired end read libraries were prepared from total rna extracted from primary needles of uninfected seedlings  and infected seedlings with resistant  and susceptible  genotypes . for each of three cdna libraries,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million 76-bp paired end reads were collected respectively. an overview of the raw reads data is given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  only  <dig> % of raw reads were discarded due to low quality bases and reads . a separate assembly was performed for each of the three libraries and produced  <dig>  to  <dig>  contigs with an average n <dig> of  <dig> -bp and an average length of 875-bp . we also performed a single assembly of the total reads from all three cdna libraries, which generated a common transcriptome data set of  <dig>  contigs having a minimum length of 300-bp and a minimum mapped read of  <dig> 
de novo 
assembly

common transcriptome

a)contigs were selected with minimum length of 300-bp and minimum mapped reads of  <dig> 

since the separate assembly approach aligned more raw reads  into contigs and mapped them back to the assembled transcripts than did the single assembly approach , a reciprocal blastn approach was used for search of one cdna library assembly with another. this process generated a consensus transcriptome of  <dig>  unique genes with each contig present in at least two cdna libraries. this assembly of  <dig>  contigs had an average length of  <dig> -bp and a total length of ~51-mb. the remaining contigs specific for each cdna library were searched again by blastn against the pgi database, and those sample-specific contigs with strong blastn hits  were added to the consensus transcriptome, producing a transcriptome of  <dig>  contigs as reference for further analysis.

using blast programs to assess the de novo assembly quality, the consensus transcriptome of  <dig>  unique transcripts was compared with the pgi and spruce gene index  databases, the protein database of the poplar leaf rust fungus melampsora laricis-populina, as well as a set of p. monticola est data . blast analysis revealed that 85%  of infected p. monticola consensus assembly showed significant homology to the pgi and sgi databases , about  <dig>  contigs  having orthologous hits in the pgi database alone. only  <dig> % of the infected wwp consensus transcriptome had orthologous hits in the poplar leaf rust fungus genome , suggesting that ~5% of the assembled transcripts may come from c. ribicola. blastn analysis also revealed that ~97% of the p. monticola ests had orthologous hit in the p. monticola consensus assembly  . these results indicate that we obtained a high percentage of p. monticola expressed genes and thus further support application of the de novo assembled transcriptome for global gene expression profiling.

transcriptional profile of western white pine primary needles
the top ten contigs with the highest expression values  of total gene reads accounted for 30% of total mapped reads and they were followed by about  <dig>  contigs that were mapped by 90% of total mapped reads . when gene expression levels were normalised by the reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads  values to get a more reasonable index for relative levels of transcript expression, the top  <dig> contigs with the highest rpkm values  were still mapped by 26% of total mapped reads. there were ~ <dig>  contigs with highly abundant expression levels at rpkm ≥ <dig> and ~ <dig>  contigs with transcript levels at rpkm ≥ <dig> in the control primary needles  . the transcriptome set with  <dig>  contigs appeared to be saturated as estimated by either total gene reads or rpkm. the top  <dig> unigenes with most abundant transcript expression were p. monticola homologs encoding for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase , rrna intron encoded homing endonuclease, a chloroplastic oxygen-evolving enhancer protein, a chlorophyll a/b binding protein, s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, rubisco activase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, cell wall-associated hydrolase, as well as conserved hypothetical proteins with unknown function .

annotation of the primary needle transcriptome
gene annotation was performed for the p. monticola primary needle transcriptome assembly based on sequence homologies to the databases of the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant sequences , the protein information resource , the universal protein resource , the gene ontology , and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  using blast2go. gene names and go terms were assigned to the contigs based on their homologies to these available databases. about 72% of total contigs  were assigned gene names and 50% of them  were assigned at least one go term. go annotation assignments classified  <dig>  unique contigs into  <dig> subcategories of the biological process category,  <dig> subcategories of the molecular function category, and  <dig> subcategories of the cellular component category at level  <dig> . the four subcategories with the most highly abundant transcripts under the biological process category were metabolic process , cellular process , biological regulation , and response to stimulus . the subcategories with the most highly abundant transcripts in the molecular function category included binding , catalytic activity , and transporter activity . within the cellular components category, the four most common groups of proteins were assigned to the subcategories of cell , organelle , membrane , and macromolecular complex  .

to further estimate the completeness of the transcriptome data and the effectiveness of annotations, we searched annotated contig sequences using goslim_plant. more than one quarter  of the sequences were localized to the plastid,  <dig> % to the mitochondrion,  <dig> % to the nucleus, and  <dig> % to the plasma membrane. the extracellular space and cell wall were localized by about 4% of total sequences, contributing to the first layer of plant defence to outside stimuli .

gene annotation conducted using enzyme code and kegg databases revealed activities of many biological pathways in p. monticola primary needles. a total of  <dig>  enzymes encoded by  <dig>  transcripts were mapped to  <dig> metabolic pathways . six pathways with the most abundant unique sequences included starch and sucrose metabolism , purine metabolism , phenylalanine metabolism , methane metabolism , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism . each of these metabolic pathways was mapped with at least  <dig> unique transcripts.

detection of differentially expressed genes  in response to rust infection
a quality control test on the data assembled from each cdna library confirmed that they were suitable for statistical analysis for deg identification . we compared three wwp primary needle transcriptome profiles  to better understand the wpbr pathosystem at the transcriptome level. the reference transcriptome with  <dig>  contigs was used to map raw reads for deg detection between any two treatments. a total of  <dig> degs were revealed with a rpkm fold change?>? <dig>  and a cut-off of p?<? <dig>  with z-test by bonferroni-correction . we detected  <dig> degs in compatible wp-br interaction  and  <dig> degs in incompatible wp-br interaction  . there were  <dig> degs regulated similarly after c. ribicola infection in both susceptible and resistant seedlings while there were  <dig> degs regulated differently .

the expression patterns were clustered into eight different types based on the k-means method: five types for up-regulation patterns  and three types for down-regulation patterns . the type i cluster included degs regulated positively in both resistant and susceptible seedlings at similar magnitudes . while types ii and iii degs also showed up-regulation in both resistant and susceptible seedlings, they differed in degree of up-regulation . the type iv cluster included degs with rust-enhanced transcript levels only in susceptible seedlings  and type v included degs enhanced only in resistant seedlings . down-regulated patterns after c. ribicola infection are represented by types vi - viii. degs down-regulated at similar levels in both resistant and susceptible seedlings were grouped into the type vi . the type vii included degs with greater down-regulation levels in susceptible than in resistant seedlings . the type viii included degs regulated negatively by rust infection only in resistant seedlings .

to confirm gene expression level measured by rpkm fold change, a subset of  <dig> contigs were subjected to analysis of quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . as shown in figure  <dig>  the relative transcript levels measured by qrt-pcr and rna-seq were highly correlated  with statistical significance .

to explore potential functions of degs in response to c. ribicola invasion, go-based classification was conducted. eighty-five percent  of all degs showed significant homologies with expressed genes from other organisms. go analysis classified  <dig> of the annotated degs into  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> subgroups  of the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories, respectively . the three biological processes most affected by c. ribicola infection were in the subcategories of metabolic process , cellular process  and response to stimulus . among the  <dig> metabolic pathways identified as active in infected white pine needles,  <dig> of them were affected significantly by rust infection. only ~ <dig> % of total annotated contigs  were regulated by rust infection, but they encoded ~ <dig> % of total annotated enzymes  in the primary needle transcriptome. based on their high sequence and enzyme numbers, the top  <dig> rust-modulated pathways were flavonoid biosynthesis, methane metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism .

degs specifically regulated in resistant seedlings
a total of  <dig> degs were detected in the comparison of the resistant genotype  at 4-dpi with control at 0-dpi. of these  <dig> degs,  <dig> were regulated only in resistant seedlings while another  <dig> genes were also regulated by rust infection in susceptible  seedlings . of the  <dig> resistance-specific degs,  <dig> were up-regulated with fold changes up to  <dig>  and one transcript by de novo synthesis  and  <dig> were down-regulated with fold changes down to − <dig> by rust infection . the up-regulated degs included a set of putative signal receptor genes encoding putative r proteins with domains of nucleotide-binding site  and leucine-rich repeat , receptor-like protein kinases , calcineurin b-like -interacting protein kinases , f-box family proteins , and abscisic acid  receptor; transcriptional factor  genes of multiple families ; genes homologous to apoptosis-inducing factor , flowering locus t-like protein , and subtilisin-like protease; as well as a wide diversity of down-stream genes  . a large proportion of down-regulated degs were related to photosystem i and ii, the metabolic pathway of carbon fixation, and flavonoid biosynthesis . expansins are an example of cell-wall proteins down-regulated by rust infection in resistant seedlings.

degs specifically regulated in susceptible seedlings
a total of  <dig> degs modulated by c. ribicola infection  were detected in the comparison of the susceptible  genotype with un-infected control seedlings. one hundred sixty of these degs were specifically regulated in susceptible seedlings,  <dig> genes of them up-regulated with fold changes up to  <dig>  and  <dig> genes down-regulated with fold changes down to − <dig> . in additional to a tf gene with a wrky domain, we detected up-regulated genes for subsets of calcium-binding proteins, chitinases , tlps , other pr proteins , and myrosinase-binding proteins  specifically in susceptible seedlings . apart from genes involved in photosystems, transcripts from multiple types of retrotransposons were noted among the down-regulated genes in the susceptible seedlings .

degs regulated similarly in both resistant and susceptible seedlings
of the  <dig> degs co-modulated in both resistant and susceptible genotypes,  <dig> of them showed no significant difference between both genotypes;  <dig> of these degs were up-regulated and  <dig> degs down-regulated following rust infection . a number of zinc-finger, ring-finger, fbp genes, and tfs  were up-regulated in both genotypes, as well as transcripts encoding for subsets of proteins regulated in auxin-mediated signalling, dnaj chaperone family protein, glutathione s-transferases , peroxidises, thioredoxins, chtinases, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig>  β-glucanases, glucanase-inhibitors, and enzymes related to biosyntheses of ethylene, phenylpropanoid, and stilbenoid , suggesting their involvement in basal host response to c. ribicola invasion. in addition to transcripts for a group of small heat-shock proteins , genes for photoassimilate-responsive proteins and enzymes related to carbon fixation in photosynthesis and flavonoid biosysthesis were among the  <dig> degs negatively regulated in both resistant and susceptible seedlings .

degs regulated differentially in both resistant and susceptible seedlings
a total of  <dig> degs were detected in the comparison between resistant and susceptible genotypes;  <dig> degs showed relatively higher transcript levels in resistant seedlings than in susceptible seedlings  while  <dig> degs showed the opposite expression pattern . although carbon fixation in photosynthesis is down-regulated in both resistant and susceptible seedlings, the relative expression levels of related transcripts were higher in resistant seedlings, suggesting that rust infection caused less damage to photosynthesis in resistant seedlings than in susceptible seedlings. relatively higher levels of transcripts related to biosynthesis of cellulose, flavonoid, flavone and flavonol in resistant seedlings suggested that more active production of these compounds may be beneficial to trees infected by wpbr. in contrast, relatively lower levels of transcripts in resistant than in susceptible seedlings indicated that compatible wp-br interactions may lead to more active metabolisms for phenylalanine, tyrosine, starch and sucrose .

discussion
we used rna-seq technology to generate transcriptome data and examined global gene expression profiles to identify defense-responsive genes in wp-br interactions. this work demonstrates that rna-seq is a useful and effective tool for de novo transcriptome assembly and discovery of candidate genes underlying host genetic resistance to pathogens, even in a non-model species without genome and complete est databases. enzyme annotation and pathway assignment of the p. monticola transcriptome provides a genomics resource for further investigating candidate genes involved in various metabolic pathways in a conifer species, such as those involved in physiological responses to environmental stresses. comparison of sequence data from infected vs. non-infected and resistant vs. susceptible transcriptomes revealed almost one thousand degs using z-test with a bonferroni correction , and 85% of them were functionally annotated. it is noteworthy that a number of the degs revealed by rna-seq include p. monticola defence-related genes/proteins investigated in previous studies, such as nbs-lrr, pr <dig>  tlp , pr <dig>  amp, hsp, and other defence-related genes  <cit> . qrt-pcr analysis of a subset of degs further verified transcript expression levels as revealed by transcriptome comparison from raw rna-seq data. these consistent results from various research strategies indicate that rna-seq provides a powerful tool for comprehensive transcriptome profiling that reveals important molecular interactions in the wpbr pathosystem.

cr <dig> candidates for incompatible wp-br interaction
plants have evolved and adapted various defense mechanisms to protect themselves from invasions by microbial pathogens. plant immunity is controlled by two layers of inducible responses: basal response triggered by conserved microbial features, and specific response triggered by gene-for-gene recognition. specific responses to pathogen attack activate effector-triggered immunity  through direct or indirect interaction of host r proteins with pathogen effector/ avirulence proteins, which leads to the hypersensitive response , a defense mechanism featured by programmed cell death  around the local pathogen infection sites  <cit> . white pine cr2-seedlings display a typical hr in response to infection by c. ribicola avcr <dig> strain, presumably by recognizing the avcr <dig> product using an uncharacterized receptor encoded by the p. monoticola r gene cr <dig> <cit> . in other well-characterized pathosystems, the incompatible interaction usually leads to a series of dramatic molecular changes such as ion flux, a ros burst, callose deposition, and eventually hr-like cell death, resulting in complete resistance to avirulent pathogenic strains  <cit> . in contrast, susceptible plants show only basal responses through interaction of host pattern recognition receptors  with pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns . in pamp- or mamp-triggered immunity , pathogen avirulence factors  promote virulence by targeting other host proteins  to manipulate plant physiological processes more suitable to pathogen growth and multiplication in susceptible plants  <cit> .

deciphering the transcript fingerprint of cr <dig> is one of the key questions in studying the molecular wp-br interactions. in this study, we identified two nbs-lrr genes  and two rlk genes  with significant up-regulation only in resistant seedlings post c. ribicola infection , which provides novel insight into the expression profiles of these two plant superfamilies in the wpbr pathosystem  <cit> . most characterized plant r genes belong to the nbs-lrr or rlk superfamily for plant r-avr interactions  <cit> . up-regulation of rlk and nbs-lrr homologous transcripts in resistant seedlings by infection of the avcr <dig> rust strain suggests their involvement in white pine major gene  resistance. snp genotyping of both p. monticola nbs-lrr and rlk superfamilies for positional r candidates would help resolve the molecular characterization of cr <dig> 

downstream signalling networks triggered by incompatible r-avr interactions are mediated by calcium-activated protein kinases  and mitogen-activated pk  cascades  <cit> . these signalling networks then control the activities and synthesis of a series of tfs, enzymes, phytohormones , pr proteins, amps, phytoalexins and other secondary metabolites, which coordinately contribute to host resistance against pathogens  <cit> . consistent with this widely accepted r-avr interaction model, we detected significant up-regulation of transcripts for mapk, cipk, snf1-related pk regulatory subunit, and other pks in p. monticola resistant seedlings following rust infection. cbls act as ca2+ sensors to activate specific pks. rice cipks participate in various layers of mamp-induced defense responses, leading to final pcd in rice  <cit> . arabidopsis mapks  are positive mediators of defense responses induced by mamp and pathogen, controlling both basal resistance and elicitor-induced resistance to fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea <cit> . as a regulatory subunit of the snf1-related protein kinase  complex, snf1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit beta- <dig> likely plays a role in a signal transduction cascade regulating gene expression and carbohydrate metabolism in plant response to environmental stresses. snrk2s phosphorylate ser/thr residues in the r-x-x-s/t motif of the abf type tfs for activation of a large number of aba/stress-responsive genes  <cit> . rust-upregulated transcript expression suggests that several p. monticola pk families, including mapks, cipks and snrk2s , may be intermediate factors involved in cr2-mediated resistance to c. ribiciola.

novel p. monticola genes involved in the cr2-mediated resistance
among degs positively regulated in cr2-mediated resistance, p. monticola genes homologous to genes encoding aif, ft-like protein, subtilisin-like protease, ring/fyve/phd zinc finger-containing proteins, and membrane attack complex component/perforin  domain proteins, attracted our attention . the macpf domain proteins are well-known for their critical functions in innate and adaptive immunity, and they are capable of forming transmembrane lytic pores known as the membrane-attack complex  by interacting with other cell components for pathogen invasion or host protection. arabidopsis macpf proteins probably act as mediators that recognize plant signals for negative regulation of cell death programs and defense responses  <cit> . both sa and a chitin elicitor promote expression of an arabidopsis macpf gene  and the cad <dig> mutant shows spontaneously activated expression of pr genes and greatly increased sa levels  <cit> . ring finger proteins constitute a large family and play key roles in regulating plant growth/developmental processes, hormone signalling, and responses to biotic stresses. a rice ring-h <dig> finger gene  was induced differentially in an incompatible interaction with magnaporthe grisea, and its constitutive expression led to enhanced disease resistance and elevated expression levels of defense-related genes encoding pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> proteins  <cit> . up-regulation of a p. monticola macpf homolog and differential expression of the p. monticola ring gene family in the incompatible wp-br interaction suggest their potential roles in conifer defense against c. ribicola.

as a positive regulator of apoptosis in mammals, aifs function in apoptotic and redox signalling: which enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics and complex i activity/assembly to help maintain proper cellular redox homeostasis in mitochondria and forms a chromatin degrading complex with other proteins in the nucleus  <cit> . in addition to up-regulation of an aif homolog in the incompatible wp-br interaction, we also observed differential expression of families of thioredoxins, gsts and peroxidises , suggesting that redox signalling by oxidative burst is part of the defence mechanism of p. monticola against c. ribicola <cit> . recently a unique peptide signal , embedded in a soybean subtilisin-like protein, was discovered to activate the transcription of defense genes against pathogens  <cit> . although transcript levels of two subtilisin-like protein homologs were significantly up-regulated in cr2-mediated resistance , whether these proteins are processed to generate signal peptides involved in host defence is still an interesting question to address in future studies. plant ft rna is able to travel by its cis-element from leaf to shoot apical meristem  <cit> , suggesting its role in systemic signalling by intercellular rna trafficking through phloem transport. rna trafficking contributes to local and long-distance coordination of plant development and response to the environment  <cit> . a further functional analysis of these p. monticola novel defence-related genes would provide novel insight into resistance mechanisms of this conifer.

aba signalling involved in the cr2-mediated resistance
among other intermediate factors potentially functioning in cr2-triggerred signalling, we detected significant up-regulation of transcripts for aba receptor, aba 8-hydroxylase, gram-containing aba-responsive protein, and annexin proteins in resistant seedlings post c. ribicola infection . apart from its central role in plant development, aba plays a modulating role in diverse plant-pathogen interactions mediated at least in part by crosstalk with ja and sa  <cit> . aba receptor proteins bind and respond to the hormone by activating the transcription of aba-responsive genes involved in plant stress responses  <cit> , including pr <dig> proteins  <cit> .

the gram  domain is ubiquitous in glucosyltransferases, myotubularins, and other membrane-associated proteins in eukaryotes  <cit> . the pepper gram domain–containing aba-responsive protein, abr <dig>  negatively regulates aba signaling by suppressing aba biosynthesis, but promotes sa and ros production, ultimately leading to cell death and disease resistance  <cit> . the mutant plants of an aba 8′-hydroxylase gene  accumulated a higher level of stress-induced aba with exaggerated aba-inducible gene expression. aba treatment suppresses induction of systemic acquired resistance  by inhibiting the sa pathway  <cit> . as signaling components with phospholipid binding ability, some annexin proteins are implicated in responses to aba, oxidative, saline, cold, and pathogenic stress  <cit> . consistent with these studies, we observed a dramatic up-regulation of p. monticola transcripts for five proteins in resistant seedlings: aba receptor pyl <dig>  gram-containing aba-responsive protein, aba 8-hydroxylase, aba-responsive protein, and annexin homolog , suggesting that aba-signalling may play a part in the cr2-mediated resistance.

auxin signalling involved in the cr2-mediated resistance
it is notable that  <dig> auxin-related transcripts were positively regulated by c. ribicola infection , and  <dig> of them were up-regulated specifically in resistant seedlings or with significantly higher expression levels in resistant seedlings than in susceptible seedlings, including two tfs . arf <dig> belongs to a tf family that binds to auxin-responsive elements  in the promoters of auxin-regulated genes, and acts as the intermediate factor for crosstalk between the primary signaling pathways of auxin and aba  <cit> . auxin itself is known as a virulence factor to suppress host defense in some plant pathosystems  <cit> . pathogen-secreted indole-3-acetic acid  increases rice disease symptoms by inducing expansins that cause loosening of the cell wall  <cit> . white pine bark tissues increase a few-fold in thickness as fusiform swelling in the cankered regions  in susceptible seedlings, suggesting that c. ribicola may release plant hormone to induce proliferation of host bark cells in responsive  hosts  <cit> . in cr2-resistant seedlings we found dramatic up-regulation  of a number of genes that down-regulate auxin and cellulose synthase-like protein , but expansin genes were highly suppressed , indicating that auxin may have complex roles in the wp-br interaction, and suppression of auxin action may be another important mechanism underlying the cr2-mediated resistance by suppressing the loosening of the pine cell wall.

the ubiquitin–proteasome system  was regulated by c. ribicola infection
ups is a protein degradation system worthy of special attention in the wpbr pathosystem because all  <dig> related degs were positively regulated by c. ribicola infection and  <dig> of them were up-regulated only in resistant seedlings . the ups-related genes specifically regulated in the resistance response include various types of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin-associated  zinc-finger  and phox/bem1p  domain proteins. the ups regulates proteins of the aba receptor-signal complex and its downstream targets. most f-box proteins  are characterized as components of the scf  e <dig> ubiquitin–ligase complex, which participates in the recognition and recruitment of target proteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the 26s ups. expression of many fbps is transcriptionally regulated in a temporal and tissue specific manner, or in response to biotic stressors  <cit> . auxin binding to the scf complex results in enhanced removal of tf repressors belonging to the aux/iaa family through the scf e3-ubiquitin ligase proteasome  pathway  <cit> . the degradation of the aux/iaa transcriptional repressors leads to the activation of arfs and the expression of auxin-responsive genes, which, in turn, positively regulate plant resistance to necrotrophic fungi in arabidopsis  <cit> . the proteins of the plant p62/nbr1/joka <dig> family contain pb <dig>  zz and c-terminal uba domains and presumably function as cargo receptors in the selectivity of autophagy, which may constitute an important part of plant response to environmental stresses  <cit> . accumulated evidence has identified subunits and proposed regulators of scf ubiquitin ligases as essential components of r gene-mediated resistance  <cit> . up-regulation of the ups- and fbp-related transcripts may help white pine to reprogram cellular homeostasis by recovering normal conformation of proteins and enzymes for resistance to c. ribicola invasion.

differential regulation of multiple tf families in the wpbr pathosystem
down-stream defense-responsive genes are normally regulated positively or negatively by different tfs that are direct or indirect targets of various signal transduction pathways. the p. monticola tfs differentially expressed between compatible and incompatible interactions belong to a few superfamilies with well-characterized structural domains such as arf <dig>  iaa <dig>  ap <dig>  zinc-finger ccch type, zinc-finger-hd, platz, nac, dof zinc-finger, ap2/erf-b <dig>  r2r3-myb, wrky, c3hl, hd-leucine-zipper, and tubby-like f-box. other genes potentially involved in regulating transcription processes include nuclear tf y subunit b- <dig>  cold-shock dna-binding protein, ethylene-responsive transcriptional co-activator, and other dna-binding proteins .

in addition to arf <dig> and iaa <dig> functioning in auxin-signalling, we found five other families of tfs  responsive specifically in cr2-resistance. a soybean zinc finger homeodomain tf, gmzf-hd <dig>  activates the expression of the calmodulin gmcam <dig> in response to pathogens by specifically interacting with a/t-rich repeats in the promoter  <cit> . platz is a class of plant-specific zinc-dependent dna-binding protein responsible for a/t-rich sequence-mediated transcriptional repression  <cit> . the dof tf family is involved in the control of a variety of plant-specific processes, including defense response, phytochrome signaling, and phenylpropanoid metabolism in an environmental and tissue-specific manner  <cit> . six rice nac genes showed preferential expression under biotic stress  <cit> . arabidopsis nac tfs may play a dual role in regulating both ja- and aba-dependent responses  <cit> . an arabidopsis nac tf  functions as an attenuator of aba signalling for the mediation of efficient penetration resistance upon blumeria graminis attack  <cit> . nac tfs manipulate plant stress responses by activating other genes encoding r2r3-myb tf, amylase, cold responsive protein, dehydration responsive proteins, gst, and late embryogenesis abundant  proteins  <cit> . we observed significant regulation of two nac homologs as well as gst, r2r3-myb, and lea genes following c. ribicola infection. whether the latter are the targets of the p. monticola nac tfs is an interesting question to address in future work.

p. monticola tf genes of six families  were up-regulated in both resistant and susceptible seedlings. two degs were detected in each family of the tfs with ap2/erf-b <dig>  r2r3-myb, or ccch type zinc finger domain, respectively. one family member was responsive in both resistant and susceptible seedlings while another was responsive only in resistant seedlings. plant zinc-finger ccch type tfs have been implicated to function in a series of plant developmental and adaptive processes, including plant defense responses to biotic stresses, by regulating gene expression from the transcriptional to posttranscriptional levels  <cit> . a loss-of-function mutant of an arabidopsis zinc finger ccch domain-containing protein showed an increased local susceptibility to a fungal pathogen and sensitivity to seed germination in the presence of aba  <cit> . arabidopsis r2r3-myb tf  directly acts on the promoters of the flavonoid biosynthesis genes and it is placed at the downstream end of the signalling chain that causes flavonol-specific gene activation in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  <cit> . wheat r2r <dig> myb tf  mediates host resistance to fungal pathogen and drought stresses by regulating defense-related genes  through aba- and sa-signalling pathways  <cit> . accompanying differential expression of p. monticola r2r3-myb genes, we also observed differential expression of genes encoding enzymes related to biosynthesis of flavonol and phenylpropanoid, as well as genes encoding for multiple members of cytochrome p <dig>  the tlp , pr <dig>  and other pr families between resistant and susceptible genotypes.

plant tfs with one ap2/erf domain together with one b <dig> domain are assigned to the rav  family belonging to the plant ap2/erf superfamily, and rav family tfs have been reported to respond to hormones  and biotic stresses  <cit> . over-expression of a rav gene induced expression of erf  and pr <dig> genes and increased tolerance to bacterial pathogen in transgenic tomato  <cit> . p. monticola acc oxidase genes were up-regulated and one ethylene-responsive transcriptional coactivitor was down-regulated in similar patterns in both resistant and susceptible seedlings, suggesting ethylene-signalling may be involved only in the basal response in the wpbr pathosystem. however, two p. monticola rav  homologs showed differential expression between cr2/- and cr2/cr <dig> genotypes, suggesting their up-stream intermediate factors  may be different between two genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study wwp primary needles pooled from multiple seedlings at early stages  post c. ribicola infection were used for cdna library construction. secondary needle, stem , and other tissues from more mature wwp trees or from tissues at relatively late pathogen infection stages could be investigated to detect tissue-specific defence responses and to identify host genes regulated specifically during other infection phases of the c. ribicola life cycle. these host genes may be found to contribute more to quantitative disease resistance. in this study, about  <dig> % of the whole transcriptome assembly was identified as rust-responsive genes and 85% of them were functionally annotated in p. monticola defense, but their putative contribution to host resistance to c. ribicola awaits verification by functional genomics studies or association studies focused on exploring gene variation in p. monticola populations.

rna-seq analysis of the wp-br interactions revealed that  two types of plant r candidates  were up-regulated specifically in resistant genotype following c. ribicola infection, suggesting a distinct role of these r candidates in cr2-mediated resistance;  the biosynthesis and signalling pathways of multiple plant hormones  were coordinately regulated following rust infection, indicating that the auxin and aba-mediated signaling pathways are involved in white pine resistance to rust; 3) a set of novel tfs were identified in response to c. ribicola infection, some of them  specifically responsive in the incompatible wp-br interaction; and 4) several families of pr proteins , ros-related proteins , ups proteins, and retrotransposons were differentially expressed at the transcriptional level between resistant and susceptible genotypes following c. ribicola infection.
