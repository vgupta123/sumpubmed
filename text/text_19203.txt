BACKGROUND
the transcription factor p <dig>  which belongs to a family of genes that also include p <dig> and p <dig>  plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of many biological processes including development, differentiation and apoptosis <cit> . interestingly, p <dig> exhibits a restricted spatio-temporal expression pattern with high levels reported in epithelial cells. indeed, the function of p <dig> has been predominantly examined in stratified epithelium in many organs such as the skin, mammary glands, prostate etc. both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies have clearly demonstrated that p <dig> is a critical master regulator of the epithelial differentiation program <cit> . this is quite evident in the dramatic phenotype of the p <dig> knockout mice, which lack stratified epithelium and their derivatives in multiple tissues and organs <cit> .

the biological function of p <dig> is mediated by several isoforms derived from distinct transcripts that are generated from a complex genomic structure. the p <dig> gene gives rise to two major transcript variants through the use of distinct promoters, which are located far apart from each other <cit> . the proximal promoter located upstream of exon <dig> directs the expression of transcripts that encode for an amino terminal transactivation domain , whereas an internal promoter embedded within the third intron controls the expression of transcripts that lack this domain . in addition, both the ta and Δn transcripts are differentially spliced at the 3' end to generate proteins with unique c-termini that are designated as α, β and γ isoforms of p <dig> 

all isoforms of p <dig> share a dna-binding and an oligomerization domain, which shows sequence conservation with p <dig>  hence, these proteins are capable of sequence specific dna-binding to p <dig> response elements and related sequences. although the Δnp <dig> isoforms were initially thought to function by exerting dominant negative effects on tap <dig>  it is increasingly becoming clear that the Δnp <dig> proteins also mediate direct transcriptional activation and repressor activities on target genes  <cit> . in view of the fact that there are high levels of Δnp <dig> protein but not tap <dig> in many epithelial cells and that the Δnp <dig> isoform is the only form of p <dig> present in lower organisms, it is thought that Δnp <dig> may be the primary mediator of the biological function of the p <dig> gene.

since p <dig> is a transcription factor, it is likely that it governs the various cellular processes and developmental decisions by regulating specific target genes. although p <dig> has been shown to regulate some well-characterized p <dig> responsive genes, it is becoming increasingly evident that there exists a unique set of p <dig> target genes <cit> . this notion is further strengthened by the fact that p <dig> has a distinct functional role in development and that the dna-binding activity of these two proteins exhibits clear differences <cit> . it is also possible that both p <dig> and p <dig> can regulate common target genes as exemplified by maspin, igfbp- <dig> and perp, which though initially were thought to be regulated by p <dig> are now clearly proven to also be p <dig> targets  <cit> . to identify additional p <dig> targets, some laboratories have utilized an experimental model system where cells lacking p <dig>  such as saos <dig> or hek  <dig>  were assessed for global alterations in gene expression by microarray analysis under conditions where p <dig> is over expressed <cit> . although these and similar other studies have unearthed some interesting potential p <dig> targets, identifying the exact location of the cis-elements that mediate the transcriptional effects of p <dig> have remained elusive <cit> . hence, a direct examination of p63-responsive elements in epithelial cells, which express high levels of p <dig> under physiological conditions, is warranted.

keratinocytes express high levels of Δnp <dig> and have provided a useful model system to dissect the role of p <dig> and to study its target genes <cit> . these studies have been facilitated by chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments to confirm known p <dig> binding sites within the promoters of selected downstream targets in vivo. although chip can be also a powerful tool to identify previously unknown targets of transcription factors, technical limitations have often precluded such an experimental strategy. in this paper, we report our initial results with an improved genomic chip approach to isolate and characterize  <dig> potential genomic Δnp <dig> binding sites in keratinocytes. these sites are associated with various genes involved in a wide variety of cellular processes including transcription, signaling and metabolism. as proof of principle we have confirmed the association of Δnp <dig> with a subset of these targets both in vitro and in vivo. finally, we demonstrate that the expression levels of the potential Δnp <dig> target genes located close to these genomic binding locations are affected when p <dig> levels are lowered. collectively, our studies highlight the robustness of our experimental strategy to unearth novel targets for Δnp <dig> and thus can be extended to other transcription factors.

RESULTS
a modified chip strategy for enrichment and cloning of Δnp63-target elements
to better understand the mechanisms by which Δnp <dig> transcriptionally regulates the keratinocyte development and differentiation program we sought to identify its in vivo target genes by a chip strategy. for this purpose we utilized hacat cells, which are immortalized human keratinocytes that have been widely used to study keratinocyte biology. these cells express high levels of Δnp <dig>  which can be detected by an isoform-specific antibody rr- <dig> that has been generated by our laboratory and has been successfully used in chip experiments <cit> . chip strategy is widely utilized to examine if a specific genomic site is occupied by a transcription factor in the context of a living cell. however, identification of unknown targets by cloning and sequencing the dna that is obtained from the immunoprecipitated material has proven to be technically challenging. this is mostly due to limiting amounts of dna obtained during the procedure and overwhelming excess of non-specifically precipitated dna. to overcome these issues, we incorporated two additional steps in our experimental scheme to improve the efficiency of obtaining Δnp <dig> targets. first we utilized a ligation-mediated pcr technique, during which the chip products obtained after immmunoprecipitation were ligated to linkers and amplified by pcr using the linker sequence for priming <cit> . this allowed us to obtain sufficient material for subsequent purification and cloning . second, to reduce the contamination with non-specific dna fragments, we purified the pcr-amplified fragments by incubation with agarose beads containing gst-Δnp63α protein. this enrichment procedure allowed us to select for dna fragments that are more likely to contain binding-sites for Δnp <dig>  the dna fragments obtained from chromatin immunoprecipitation were then digested with restriction enzyme  and cloned into pbluescript vector as described in materials and methods. we isolated and sequenced  <dig> individual clones that represented the dna fragments immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> 

the location and identity of the Δnp <dig> target genomic dna fragments obtained after chip cloning
we searched the human genomic database by blast to determine the location of the immunoprecipitated dna fragments in relation to known or predicted genes. this analysis revealed that  <dig> of the extracted dna fragments immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> mapped in proximity to known, annotated or predicted genes . we used the following criteria to assign the dna fragments to a specific gene: if the sequence matched a) to the intragenic region of a known or predicted gene or b) to a region within  <dig> kb upstream or downstream of a gene. tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> list the genomic distribution of the  <dig> gene-associated Δnp <dig> binding fragments. the remaining chip fragments that were obtained from sequencing were not analyzed further since they either corresponded to non-annotated regions of the human genome or no mrna or est sequence that would predict a gene was found within a  <dig> kb distance of the dna fragment. it is possible that some of these genomic sequences may represent distal enhancers involved in regulating gene expression from distances significantly farther than  <dig> kb as has been demonstrated for many enhancers. alternatively, these segments may denote non-annotated regions of the genome that do not encode for conventional genes but are sites for mirna and similar elements. some of these elements may also represent experimental artifacts resulting from non-specific dna-binding of Δnp <dig> to certain chromatin regions that are captured during formaldehyde cross-linking or contaminating dna obtained during the immunoprecipitation or pcr enrichment steps.

examination of the sixty-two potential Δnp <dig> target genes revealed several interesting findings. forty percent of the Δnp63-chip fragments were located within an intron of known or predicted genes, with a quarter of them in the first intron . this observation is in agreement with many other transcription factors such as myc and sp <dig> for which genomic binding sites have been deciphered on a large scale and reflects the growing evidence for the presence of intragenic cis-regulatory regions for transcriptional control. a further forty-four percent of the dna fragments chromatin immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> were located within the region spanning 100-kb upstream or downstream of candidate target genes. although several sites were located less than 10-kb upstream of a transcription start site, only a small number mapped to the promoter proximal regions. this may reflect the propensity of Δnp <dig> to act primarily through distal enhancers or simply signify under-representation of promoter regions since they are not well defined and properly annotated for a vast majority of human genes. interestingly, for a distinct number of cases the sequence chromatin immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> corresponded to a region that was close to two genes; for example fragment a <dig> mapped to a segment that was at the 5' end of the napa gene but also closely located at the 3' of znf <dig> gene . in such situations, the close proximity of the p63-response element to both of these potential target genes makes it difficult to ascertain whether either one or both of these genes are bona-fide Δnp <dig> targets without further experimental evidence. functional classification of these potential targets based on gene ontology categorization revealed that these are widely distributed among a wide variety of categories including transcriptional regulation, signaling cascades and metabolism. of note some of the potential Δnp <dig> target genes that we identified in our screen have been previously shown to be regulated by p <dig> . these data reaffirms the validity of our chip based cloning approach and offer further evidence that some of these previously identified targets of Δnp <dig> are direct Δnp <dig> transcriptional targets and more importantly identifies the location of the Δnp63-response elements that might be responsible for such an effect.

expression of a subset of Δnp <dig> target genes in hacat cells and confirmation of Δnp <dig> binding by independent chip assays
to facilitate further studies of the potential Δnp <dig> targets, we selected fourteen loci from the sixty initially identified by chip. these dna fragments immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> were arbitrarily chosen and represented different locations relative to the target genes and genes that were involved in a variety of cellular processes. for simplicity we focused mostly on Δnp <dig> sites that were located close to a single gene. first we performed rt-pcr experiments to test if these genes were indeed expressed in hacat cells. as a control we used human skin. of the fourteen candidates chosen, two of them waspip and syn <dig> showed no detectable expression in hacat cells . it is possible that these two genes are not expressed in hacat cells in the specific cell culture conditions used or that their normal expression is repressed by p <dig>  alternatively, expression of these genes may be restricted to the dermal or other non-keratinocyte compartment of the skin. the remaining twelve genes showed expression in both hacat cells and in skin and were chosen for further studies. since these twelve genes are co-expressed with Δnp <dig> in hacat cells, we next confirmed the binding of Δnp <dig> to the isolated chip fragments by performing independent chip assays . for these experiments, cross-linked chromatin from hacat cells was immunoprecipitated in independent experiments with two different anti-p <dig> antibodies and the co-precipitation of the Δnp63-response elements was ascertained by pcr. the antibodies we chose were an n-terminal specific antibody, rr- <dig>  which was utilized in the original genomic screen and a commercially available anti-p <dig> antibody, h- <dig> that recognizes the c-terminal domain of the Δnp63α protein. we utilized sets of primers that amplify the twelve fragments immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> and as a negative control we used a set of primers that amplify a genomic segment in the gapdh gene. as shown in figure 4a, after immunoprecipitation of cross-linked chromatin we found that there was specific enrichment of eleven potential Δnp63-response elements with both antibodies against p <dig> compared to igg control. in contrast, we did not observe any localization of Δnp <dig> to the gapdh or tada3l genomic loci as demonstrated by the negative pcr results. similar results were obtained from three independent chip experiments. the relative enrichment of each fragment was also examined by quantitative pcr in at least three independent chip experiments . for this, we performed parallel chip assays where either the two anti-p <dig> antibodies or igg was used for immunoprecipitation. the relative fold enrichment of Δnp63-chip fragments was determined by comparing the amount of fragment-specific pcr product amplified from the anti-p <dig> chip, and the negative control  chip samples. for eleven of the Δnp63-chip fragments examined significant enrichment was observed with anti-p <dig> antibody, except tada3l and control gapdh. this specific enrichment suggests that the dna fragments chromatin immunoprecipitated from the genomic screen represent bona fide binding sites for Δnp <dig> in hacat cells. the fact that the tada3l locus could not be amplified under the replicative chip conditions suggests that this may be a false positive.

direct binding of Δnp <dig> to p63-response elements located within the dna fragments immunoprecipitated by Δnp63
of the fourteen potential Δnp <dig> targets, eleven were expressed in hacat cells and independent chip experiments suggested that Δnp <dig> could associate with a genomic fragment present within or close to these genes. since this association of Δnp <dig> to such sites could be either direct or indirect, we analyzed the eleven dna fragments for the presence of p <dig> consensus dna binding sites. our recent experiments have defined the optimal p <dig> dna-binding consensus motif as aacatgtt consisting of a catg core and at-rich 5' and 3' flanking sequences <cit> . indeed many of the known p <dig> target genes contain such a p63-response element in their regulatory regions. we found that the eleven dna fragments chromatin immunoprecipitated contained at least one stretch of sequence that matched closely the p63-consensus, and in several cases more than one potential p63-response element was detected. to experimentally test these p63-like response elements, we designed oligonucleotide probes  for two of the sites from each locus that most closely matched the p63-consensus and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays . as a control, we utilized a p63-response element from the k <dig> enhancer that has been demonstrated to be a bona-fide p <dig> binding site <cit> . we used similar molar amounts of each radiolabeled oligonucleotide to allow the relative binding to each probe to be compared. emsa showed that recombinant Δnp <dig> was capable of binding strongly to at least one of the p63-response elements present in the immunoprecipitated dna fragments corresponding to all eleven target genes . for some target genes, such as mxd <dig>  nr3c <dig> and fbxo <dig> both the p63-response elements showed similar binding strength to Δnp <dig>  however, for the remaining targets only one of the oligonucleotide probes bound to Δnp <dig> suggesting that flanking sequences likely influence the dna-binding specificity as shown previously by our laboratory <cit> .

having shown that these oligonucleotides containing p63-response elements can bind to recombinant Δnp <dig> purified from bacteria, we wanted to test if they could also bind to native Δnp <dig> present in cells. for this purpose we utilized nuclear extracts from hacat cells and repeated emsas with the oligonucleotide that demonstrated the best binding to recombinant Δnp <dig> for each of the eleven target genes. upon incubation with labeled oligonucleotide, a specific complex was observed with hacat nuclear extracts in each case. this complex was clearly formed by Δnp <dig>  since addition of anti-p <dig> antibodies resulted in a distinct supershift . taken together our emsa studies suggest that the fragments immunoprecipitated contain legitimate p63-response elements that can bind to recombinant Δnp <dig> and more importantly to endogenous Δnp <dig> present in keratinocytes.

transcriptional activation of the dna fragments chromatin immunoprecipitated by Δnp63
having shown that Δnp <dig> can bind to these eleven chiped segments both in vitro and in vivo we next examined their responsiveness to Δnp <dig> in transient transfection experiments. for these experiments we chose ptk <dig> cells since these have been shown to lack any endogenous p <dig> expression. first we cloned each of the eleven fragments corresponding to the genomic regions containing p63-response elements in a luciferase reporter plasmid upstream of the heterologous thymidine kinase  promoter. each reporter plasmid was co-transfected with either an expression plasmid encoding for ha-tagged Δnp63α or an empty ha control vector. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression of Δnp63α resulted in increased levels of reporter activity  for each of the eleven constructs compared to empty vector. these data along with those obtained from the previous chip experiments and emsa strongly argue that Δnp <dig> activates these eleven target genes through the p63-response elements.

inhibition of p <dig> in hacat cells affects the expression of Δnp <dig> target genes
the fact that Δnp <dig> can bind and activate the regulatory elements associated with the target genes suggests that Δnp <dig> might be a transcriptional regulator for these genes. hence, to demonstrate more directly whether Δnp <dig> is involved in regulating expression of the putative Δnp <dig> target genes, we examined the effect of inhibiting p <dig> expression in hacat cells. we used synthetic dsrna  to reduce p <dig> expression in hacat cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  the use of sirna led to a significant reduction in the expression of p <dig> mrna levels in cells transfected with the p <dig> sirna. this reduction in p <dig> amounts was also evident at the protein level . we performed at least three quantitative rt-pcr assays using cdna synthesized from three independent rnai experiments to examine the expression of the eleven putative p <dig> target genes. the housekeeping gene b2m  was used as a reference standard. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression of six of these genes nr3c <dig>  stat <dig>  hsf <dig>  ahr, ythdf <dig>  and fbxo <dig> were dramatically reduced by more than 75% in response to p <dig> sirna. this indicates that a threshold level of p <dig> is required to maintain expression of these genes. on the other hand, three target genes znrf <dig>  notch2nl, and mark <dig> showed more modest reduction in mrna levels of approximately 50%. this relatively modest reduction in expression of these target genes may be due to the fact that persistent low level of p <dig> is sufficient to maintain their expression. alternatively, regulation of these target genes may involve additional repressors and/or activators that may compensate for the lack of p <dig>  interestingly, two genes, mxd <dig> and b4galt <dig> were modestly up regulated when p <dig> levels were low, suggesting that p <dig> might play a role in transcriptional repression of these two targets. this is despite the fact that in transient transfection experiments, the dna fragments immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> corresponding to both mxd <dig> and b4galt <dig> were positively activated by Δnp <dig> . this implies that the transcriptional regulation process of these two potential targets in vivo is more complex and that either additional direct p63-response elements exist or indirect effects from knockdown of p <dig> might influence the balance of positive and negative transcriptional regulators. overall, our data suggests that of the subset of genes identified by Δnp63-chip and examined in this study, a large proportion of them are likely to be genuine regulatory targets of Δnp <dig> in hacat cells.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
identifying target genes is critical in understanding the mechanism by which the transcription factor p <dig> regulates the intricate process of epithelial development and differentiation. towards this end, several laboratories have undertaken a target discovery approach that involves manipulating the activity of p <dig> followed by gene expression analyses <cit> . although such genome-wide microarray analysis has been valuable and has led to the identification of several transcripts that are potentially turned on and off by p <dig>  these experiments have several limitations. first, it is difficult to ascertain whether a responsive gene is a direct or an indirect target of p <dig>  second, in experiments based on over expression of p <dig>  it is likely that the response of some genes is driven by the exaggerated non-physiological concentration of this transcription factor. third, the selected cell types that have often been utilized for these studies do not express endogenous p <dig> and thus may not represent the normal cellular milieu under which p <dig> operates. finally, such studies a priori do not provide any information on the location of the p63-responsive elements that control the expression of target genes. search for such regulatory elements is further hampered by the degenerate nature of the p <dig> dna-binding sequence. indeed, bioinformatics approaches often identify an unrealistically large number of potential p <dig> binding sites without distinguishing those that are functionally relevant. hence, despite the identification of many p <dig> target genes, it has been difficult to ascertain whether p <dig> is involved in direct regulation of those genes by binding to their promoter and/or enhancer elements.

in contrast, here we have undertaken a direct approach of chip in combination with sequencing and mapping of isolated genomic dnas to locate binding sites for Δnp <dig> and its potential target genes in vivo. indeed, such chip strategies have been successfully utilized to not only determine whether a candidate genomic site is occupied by a specific transcription factor but to also identify transcription factor targets. however, in such cases it has been technically challenging to separate out the specific regulatory dna segment that is bound to the transcription factor from the vast excess of non-specifically precipitated dna. to overcome these challenges, we have fine-tuned the chip procedure and modified it to successfully identify in vivo Δnp <dig> target genes from hacat cells, which express high levels of Δnp <dig>  the major isoform of p <dig> protein in keratinocytes. first, since the immunoprecipitated dna is of limited amount, we utilized a ligation-mediated pcr technique, in which the chip products were ligated to linkers and amplified by pcr using the linker sequence. this allowed us to obtain sufficient material for subsequent purification and cloning. second, to eliminate non-specific dna fragments prior to cloning the chiped dna, we purified the pcr-amplified fragments by incubating them with agarose beads containing gst-Δnp63α. this step ensures that fragments that contain dna binding-sites for Δnp <dig> are selectively enriched and can be separated from non-specific dna. the potential caveats to such a purification step are that some dna fragments containing genuine Δnp63-targets might fail to bind to recombinant gst-Δnp63α or that non-specifically precipitated dna fragments can fortuitously bind to gst-Δnp63α under the in vitro conditions of the assay. in addition, genomic segments to which Δnp <dig> are recruited indirectly for example through protein-protein interactions are likely to be under-represented in this experimental scheme. however, our results suggest that the benefits of utilizing such an enrichment step clearly outweigh the potential drawbacks of the overwhelming background of non-specific genomic immunoprecipitated dna.

one of the interesting findings that emerge from our studies is that the vast majority of these Δnp63-binding sites are not localized to the proximal promoters of the target genes. this is in agreement with recent genome-wide target identification studies on other transcription factors such as sp <dig>  p <dig> and myc, which demonstrate that a majority of the binding sites are not in the proximal promoter but rather scattered <cit> . interestingly, a large subset of the Δnp <dig> targets were not close to any known gene; these could represent potential long range enhancers or unknown genes that have not been annotated or non-coding rnas. taken together, our study reinforces the need to not limit examination of the proximal promoter region only when searching for direct targets of transcription factors.

our improved chip-based screening strategy allowed us to identify a large number of Δnp63-response elements and their corresponding targets. here we have examined a subset of the Δnp <dig> target genes in detail. our data show that the majority of the candidate target genes are co-expressed with Δnp <dig> in hacat cells and that the specific segment isolated from the cloning of dna immunoprecipitated is indeed occupied by Δnp <dig> as determined by independent chip experiments. we also demonstrate that these segments harbor at least one p <dig> response element that can bind to both recombinant Δnp <dig> and Δnp <dig> present in hacat nuclear extract and that these segments can be transcriptionally activated by Δnp63α in transient transfection assays. finally, reduction in the levels of Δnp <dig> in hacat cells led to significant decrease in transcript levels for a majority of the p <dig> target further validating the relevance of p <dig> in regulating these genes and confirming that the eleven genes fulfill the criteria to be direct transcriptional targets of p <dig>  only two genes, mxd <dig> and b4galt <dig> were de-repressed even though in transient transfection experiments the dna fragments immunoprecipitated by Δnp <dig> corresponding to both mxd <dig> and b4galt <dig> were positively activated. the fact that the majority of the targets identified by our approach are activated by Δnp <dig> may reflect a bias towards selection of a high affinity p63-binding site due to the incorporation of an additional purification step introduced in the cloning procedure. however it is clear from numerous studies that Δnp <dig> also represses transcription . this might potentially be mediated through interaction of Δnp <dig> with non canonical response sites. collectively, our data support the growing consensus that the Δnp <dig> isoform is primarily involved in transcriptional activation of target genes rather than merely acting as a dominant negative that opposes the function of tap <dig> 

the diverse nature of the targets identified in our study reinforces the notion that p <dig> plays a role in complex biological pathways that affect a wide variety of cellular processes. as a critical regulator of keratinocyte development and differentiation, it is not difficult to imagine p <dig> as a focal point in the transcriptional network and cascades. this role of p <dig> as master regulator is supported by a large number of potential targets identified in this study that are transcription factors such as mxd <dig> and stat <dig>  similarly our identification of notch2nl as a Δnp <dig> target gene contributes to the growing list of notch family members and effectors of this pathway that are regulated by p <dig> <cit> . the p <dig> targets uncovered in our study include genes previously linked to p <dig>  such as ddr <dig>  discoidin domain receptor  <dig>  is a unique receptor tyrosine kinase activated by various types of collagens and is known to play a role in epithelial cell attachment, migration, survival, and proliferation <cit> . upregulation of ddr <dig> by p <dig> has been observed in several cases by gain of function studies; our chip analysis now clearly demonstrates that ddr <dig> is a direct transcriptional target <cit> . what is also clear from surveying the list of Δnp <dig> targets is that there are predicted genes with unknown functions. regulation of these unknown genes by Δnp <dig> may be one underlying mechanism by which p <dig> may mediate some of its myriad biological activity.

as this manuscript was in preparation, two independent studies were published in which genome-wide p <dig> binding sites were determined by chip-chip technology. in the first study, the mantovani group performed chip-on-chip experiments on hacat cells using two different platforms; the 12k cpg islands and 12k promoter arrays that led to the identification of ~ <dig> target loci  <cit> . in the second study, yang et al utilized genome wide tiled microarrays covering the entire nonrepetitive human genome, that lead to identification of ~ <dig> target sites for p <dig> <cit> . these studies were performed in me <dig> cervical carcinoma cell line with the 4a <dig> anti-p <dig> antibody that recognizes all p <dig> isoforms. a closer look at these data and that of ours presented in this paper show that the data sets generated from these studies display significant overlap but also distinct patterns. indeed twenty-five percent of the Δnp <dig> target genes that we report in this work have also been shown to be putative p <dig> target genes based on these two studies . the differences in the data sets probably result from experimental noise associated with the chip-chip experiments, differences in cell culture conditions such as cell type and/or proliferation state and the distinct antibodies utilized in these studies. the presence of different p <dig> isoforms and their unique properties surely adds to this complexity.

an interesting point to be considered is that for many of the p <dig> targets, it is likely that there are more than one p63-response elements. these elements are thus scattered in the proximal promoter, in the intragenic region and at a distance far from both the 5' and 3' end of the gene itself. pertinent to this notion, we find a p63-response element in the third intron of the ddr <dig> gene, whereas the data from yang et al., point to p63-response element located 5' of the gene  <cit> . it is likely that both these sites are bona-fide p <dig> binding sites. the presence of multiple p63-response elements reflects the importance of p <dig> in regulating ddr <dig> gene expression. this situation is similar to a well-characterized p <dig> target, the k <dig> gene, where p <dig> binding sites are present both in the proximal promoter and a distal enhancer <cit> . because each experimental condition captures only a snapshot of the entire p <dig> directed transcriptome, it is important that additional studies are performed to take into account the dynamic cellular environment in which p <dig> operates. our approach described in this paper validates the use of chip coupled with an enrichment strategy to identify transcriptional targets in vivo and demonstrates the feasibility of such an approach that can be applied on a large scale. the various complementary strategies should provide a starting point to dissect out the network of relevant p <dig> targets and offer a strong basis for the elucidation of the gene regulatory pathways that are controlled by p <dig> in keratinocytes and other cell types.
