BACKGROUND
the wild-type  p <dig> protein acts as a transcription factor that responds to a variety of stress stimuli that pose a threat to normal cells. in response to various genotoxic stresses, wt p <dig> binds specific sequence elements in the promoters of its target genes such as p <dig>  mdm <dig>  puma, and pcna  <cit> . binding of wt p <dig> results in the recruitment of the co-activator p300/cbp and subsequent acetylation of promoter associated histones h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . binding of this activation complex and increased histone acetylation was linked to increased expression of these genes. activation of wt p <dig> also causes repression of a subset of its target genes such as map <dig>  afp, bcl <dig>  survivin, and various cell cycle regulatory genes  <cit> . chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown binding of wt p <dig> to the promoter regions of some of these genes  <cit> . this binding was associated with the recruitment and binding of the co-repressors sin3a and hdac <dig>  and subsequent decreases in histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation. interestingly, gene repression in response to wt p <dig> in some cases also requires an interaction with other dna binding molecules such as sp <dig> and the nf-y complex  <cit> . therefore, wt p <dig> binds the promoters of its target genes and recruits either co-activators or co-repressors that modify histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation levels resulting in hyper-acetylated histones and increased gene expression  <cit>  or hypo-acetylated histones and decreased gene expression  <cit> . since wt p <dig> transcriptional activity is associated with dna-binding, a variety of computational and whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques have been utilized to identify direct p <dig> target genes  <cit> .

p <dig> protein consists of distinct functional domains  <cit> . the n-terminal region is involved in transactivation and the core of the protein forms a dna binding domain that interacts specifically with dna target sequences. the domain in the c-terminal region enables oligomerization of p <dig> protein, which binds to dna as a tetramer. since wt p <dig> is a critical tumor suppressor gene, it is inactivated in many human cancers  <cit> . interestingly, inactivation of wt p <dig> often occurs as single point mutation in the core dna binding domain, suggesting the importance of dna binding for the tumor suppressor function of wt p <dig>  these mutations of the p <dig> dna binding domain can be divided into two groups  <cit> . structure mutations are amino acid residue changes that cause perturbation of the structure of the dna binding surface of p <dig> protein. most common p <dig> structure mutations appear in codons r <dig>  g <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig>  <cit> . contact mutations are replacements of amino acid residues that normally make direct contact with the dna. common p <dig> contact mutants include codons r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig>  <cit> . in 15–30% of breast cancers, inactivation of p <dig> occurs by mutation, making this the most common genetic defect related to a single gene  <cit> . microarray analyses have demonstrated that accumulation of mutant  p <dig> indeed causes changes in the expression of a variety of genes, and indicates it still may affect gene transcription  <cit> . chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that mt p <dig> can bind the promoter regions of genes in vivo; however, efforts to identify mt p <dig> specific dna-binding response elements have failed  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated dna-binding and epigenetic modifications in response to induced levels of wt and mt/wt p <dig> using non-malignant htert immortalized human mammary epithelial cells . to simulate a wt p <dig> response, we used transient adenoviral infection of wt p <dig>  to determine the effect of mt p <dig> on wt p <dig> we created four stable cell lines over-expressing the r175h, r249s, r273h, and r280k p <dig> mutants in a wt p <dig> background  <cit> . these p <dig> mutants were chosen because they represent some of the most common p <dig> mutations forming together over 13% of all p <dig> mutation cases identified in breast cancer  <cit> . both methods of p <dig> overexpression resulted in comparable levels of mt/wt or wt p <dig> protein. to identify p <dig> binding sites in these scenarios and p53's effect on the epigenetic state, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to microarray hybridization that analyzed  <dig>  human gene promoters.

our study is unique from previously published results in the fact that it analyzes not only binding of wt but also the binding of mt/wt p <dig> on a genome wide scale. previous studies analyzed either only wt p <dig> binding on a genome wide scale  <cit>  or binding of selected p <dig> mutants to a few selected p <dig> target gene promoters  <cit> . to our knowledge, our study is also the first to identify the changes in histone acetylation induced by wt or mt/wt p <dig> on a genome wide scale. moreover, our model examines this role of p <dig> in the context of non-malignant mammary epithelial cells, in contrast to the malignantly transformed colon, lung and osteosarcoma cells used in previous studies. taken together, this mt/wt p <dig> model provides new insights into p <dig> dysfunction during an early point in human mammary carcinogenesis when mt p <dig> mutation coexists with wt p <dig> 

our results show that wt p <dig> binds a multitude of promoter sequences causing increases in histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation. some of these promoter sequences belong to novel, previously undescribed, p <dig> target genes. this dna-binding and increase in histone acetylation in response to wt p <dig> is associated with increases in gene expression. we did not find any direct wt p <dig> binding associated with decreases in histone acetylation or gene expression. in the mt/wt p <dig> state over  <dig> % of p <dig> specific dna binding was inhibited. the loss in p <dig> binding resulted in very little change in histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation and no changes in dna methylation. the results of our investigation demonstrate a lack of wt p <dig> repressive binding and mt p <dig> dna-binding as a whole. our data suggests that wt p <dig> dna-binding is associated with increased histone acetylation and gene expression of a multitude of target genes, including several new wt p <dig> targets.

RESULTS
cell line treatments
direct binding of p <dig> to target promoters and the effect of over-expression of wt and mt p <dig> on the epigenetic state of promoters was studied in a non-malignant htert immortalized breast epithelial cell line, hme <dig>  wt p <dig> is toxic when overexpressed in these cells; therefore the attempt to prepare cell lines stably overexpressing wt p <dig> was not successful. thus, transient overexpression of wt p <dig> from an adenoviral vector was used to induce a wt p <dig> response and the level of p <dig> expression was consistent with a physiological stress response. the p <dig> mutants r175h, r249s, r273h and r280k were stably overexpressed in hme <dig> cells containing endogenous wt p <dig> to analyze the effect that mt p <dig> had on wt p53's function as a transcription factor. we have shown previously that wt p <dig> accumulated in response to mt p <dig> overexpression in these cells  <cit> , and the accumulation of wt p <dig> likely occurred due to stabilization as a result of its interaction with mt p <dig>  <cit> . the combined level of wt and mt p <dig> protein in these cell lines was comparable to the level of wt p <dig> in cells overexpressing wt p <dig> from the adenoviral vector  <cit> . the cell lines created and used within the study described in this paper are summarized in table  <dig> 

the table displays the names of samples used within this study, mutated codon position and nucleotide and amino acid change in p <dig> if any, vector and promoter used for p <dig> variant overexpression, type of overexpression and p <dig> phenotype of the studied cell lines.

genome-wide p <dig> promoter binding
first, we identified p <dig> binding to dna targets using a chip on chip method. the do- <dig> monoclonal antibody, which is targeted against amino acids 21– <dig> of p <dig> protein and recognizes both the wt and mt p <dig> proteins, was used in our study. dna from chromatin immunoprecipitated by the do- <dig> antibody was labeled and hybridized to a  <dig>  human gene promoter microarray. the probes on this microarray represent  <dig>  human gene promoters and are pcr products that cover the regions  <dig> base pairs upstream to  <dig> base pairs downstream of transcription start  <cit> . input dna, i.e. dna from unimmunoprecipitated chromatin, was co-hybridized as a reference. do- <dig> immunoprecipitation from mda-mb- <dig> cell line that has p <dig> null phenotype and does not express p <dig> protein detectable by western blot  was used as the other reference.

the parental hme <dig> cell line with basal levels of wt p <dig> showed no significant p <dig> binding to any of the promoters on the microarray . in contrast, hme <dig> cells with transiently overexpressed wt p <dig>  exhibited significant binding to a variety of different gene promoters. wt p <dig> in these cells was found to bind to  <dig> promoters, which represents nearly 2% of the analyzed promoters . the bound promoters included many known p <dig> transcriptional targets such as plk <dig>  fas, apaf <dig>  c12orf <dig>  pcna, tp53inp <dig>  ddb <dig>  maspin, gdf <dig> and pig <dig>  in addition to known p <dig> targets there was a group of gene promoters with significant binding that had not been previously described as p <dig> targets. these genes, which include fbxo <dig>  dgkz, mgc <dig>  pcm <dig>  gdf <dig>  dpagt <dig>  ski, syk, ovol <dig> and plxnb <dig>  were identified as potential novel p <dig> targets. the total list of wt p <dig> bound promoters is provided in additional file 1

expression of mt p <dig> protein on the wt p <dig> hme <dig> background inhibited dna binding. despite the high level of wt p <dig> protein in cells overexpressing mt p <dig>  the presence of mt p <dig> led to a greater than 95% reduction in p <dig> binding to its targets. the cell line with overexpressed mt r175h showed no promoter binding. p <dig> in the remaining three cell lines overexpressing r249s, r273h and r280k mt p <dig> bound to only  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> promoters on the microarray, respectively . the promoters bound in r273h and r280k significantly overlap with promoters bound in the wt p <dig> only expressing cell line . all overlaps between p <dig> binding in mt/wt samples and p <dig> binding in ad5wt sample with respective probabilities that overlaps are just random were  <dig> promoter for r249s ,  <dig> promoters for r273h  and  <dig> promoters for r280k  . the list of promoters bound by mt/wt p <dig> is shown for each mutant in additional file  <dig>  a substantial number of promoters bound by the mutants were not detected as bound in the ad5wt cells . these data suggest that the presence of mt p <dig> inhibits the binding of wt p <dig> to its targets, and possibly allows for binding to non-target sites. further study revealed that p <dig> in the r280k mt binds only promoters with a high level of histone acetylation . our data indicate that wt p <dig> at basal levels does not bind its target sites and that the presence of a mt p <dig> can block elevated levels of wt p <dig> from binding target promoters.

genome-wide assessment of epigenetic modifications induced by p <dig> binding
since a number of p <dig> targets become epigenetically silenced in cancer, we tested whether p <dig> overexpression invokes epigenetic changes such as altered acetylation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> and methylation of dna. for histone acetylation the chromatin was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against acetylated histones h <dig> or h <dig> as two independent marks of changes in chromatin. dna from immunoprecipitated samples was labeled and hybridized to the  <dig>  human gene promoter microarray using input dna as a reference. the changes in histone acetylation relative to parental and vector only transformed cell lines were calculated. most significant changes in histone acetylation occurred in response to overexpression of wt p <dig>  histone h <dig> became significantly more acetylated in  <dig> promoters and significantly less acetylated in  <dig> promoters in this sample . acetylation of histone h <dig> increased in  <dig> promoters and decreased in  <dig> promoters in response to wt p <dig> . the total list of differentially acetylated promoters is available as additional file  <dig> 

a different situation was observed in the mt p <dig> expressing cell lines. the only mt cell line with a significantly changed histone h <dig> acetylation pattern was r175h with  <dig> promoters with increased acetylation and  <dig> promoters with decreased acetylation. the histone h <dig> acetylation in the remaining three mt p <dig> cell lines was similar to the parental cell line. the r249s showed no significant changes, r273h had  <dig> promoters with increased and  <dig> promoters with decreased acetylation, and r280k had  <dig> promoter with decreased acetylation . similar results were obtained for acetylation of histone h <dig> . interestingly, the mt r280k that demonstrated the most dna binding of all mutants, had nearly no effect on histone acetylation, and bound only to promoters that were already highly acetylated .

in order to determine if mt p <dig> alters dna methylation state, dna methylation was analyzed using two microarray platforms. one platform was a  <dig>  element cpg island microarray. this dna microarray contains ds dna probes that cover cpg rich regions dispersed throughout the human genome, including single copy regions as well as alu and satellite repeat elements  <cit> . the other platform was the  <dig>  human gene promoter microarray used for the p <dig> binding and histone acetylation study. dna samples from each of the four mt p <dig>  parental hme <dig> and vector only transformed cell lines were analyzed using a mcrbc digestion technique and hybridization to the cpg island microarray. no significant changes in dna methylation state in response to long-term mt p <dig> overexpression were found . to verify these observations, dna from parental hme <dig>  vector only, and the r175h mt cells which demonstrated the most changes in histone acetylation, was immunoprecipitated with a 5-methylcytosine specific antibody. labeled dna was hybridized to the  <dig>  human gene promoter microarray against input dna as a reference. no significant changes in dna methylation were found .

our data suggest that overexpression of wt p <dig> affected histone acetylation of a multitude of gene promoters. the expression of mt p <dig> forms did not have an effect on histone acetylation, with the exception of the r175h mt. this p <dig> mutant, however, does not bind dna at all, so the observed changes were likely an indirect effect of expression of r175h mt p <dig> protein in the cell. despite changes in acetylation of histones in r175h mt, we did not find significant changes in dna methylation in any mutant expressing cell lines. the methylation of dna in the cell line overexpressing wt p <dig>  which is harvested a short time after infection , was not determined because earlier results suggest that dna methylation does not change in such a short time frame  <cit> .

changes in acetylation in response to wt p <dig> binding
the only cell line that showed a significant number of p <dig> bound promoters and changes in histone acetylation was hme <dig> overexpressing wt p <dig> . therefore, we studied whether there is an overlap between the promoters that were bound by wt p <dig> and those whose acetylation has changed in these cells. these data are summarized in figure  <dig>  approximately  <dig> %  of the promoters bound by wt p <dig> had significant changes in acetylation of histone h <dig> or h <dig>  this overlap is highly significant, i.e. there exists a correlation between promoters bound by p <dig> and those with changed acetylation, the p-value of this overlap is lower than  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  therefore we conclude that a correlation exists between wt p <dig> dna binding and changes in histone acetylation. the majority of these promoters  had increased histone acetylation, consistent with wt p <dig> as a transcriptional activator.

p <dig> binding and expression analysis using real-time pcr
to verify the microarray p <dig> binding data, real-time pcr was performed to validate and determine the level of enrichment of selected promoter sequences in immunoprecipitated samples. we tested the promoters of  <dig> genes and gapdh as a negative control. the greatest enrichment over input was demonstrated by the promoter of the gene plk <dig> . this is consistent with microarray binding data where this promoter reached the lowest p-value  for enrichment over input. no positive promoters were confirmed by real-time pcr when the p-value was >  <dig>  . this data suggests that the p-value used to decide whether a promoter is bound by p <dig> or not is appropriate.

because p <dig> binding is likely to change the expression of its target genes, the expression of selected genes was studied using real-time rt-pcr. most of the tested genes shared an increase in expression from  <dig> fold  up to  <dig> fold  over control in response to wt p <dig> overexpression . p <dig> binding data, changes in histone acetylation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> and changes in expression for  <dig> selected genes bound by wt p <dig> according to the chip on chip analysis are summarized in table  <dig>  these genes include previously known p <dig> targets such as apaf <dig>  fas, plk <dig> and maspin and several genes that were not previously described as p <dig> transcriptional targets. the new p <dig> targets include fbxo <dig>  dgkz, gdf <dig>  syk, and plxnb <dig> 

novel direct p <dig> target genes are marked with an asterisk. the p-value column displays the p-value of enrichment of p <dig> chip sample over input detected by the microarray. the next two columns display fold enrichment of chip sample over input detected by microarray hybridization or real-time pcr, respectively. the histone h <dig> and h <dig> columns display fold changes in histone acetylation relative to the control cell lines. significant changes  in histone acetylation are marked with an asterisk. the expression column displays fold increase in expression, detected by real-time rt-pcr, relative to control.

our data suggest that epigenetic changes, such as acetylation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> are induced in response to overexpression of wt p <dig> and some p <dig> mutants in the breast epithelial cell model system, but dna methylation is not affected by the presence of mt p <dig>  this study also identified several new, previously undescribed, transcriptional targets of wt p <dig> 

discussion
we describe in this report the dna binding capacity, histone acetylation changes, and dna methylation changes in response to wt p <dig> accumulation alone and wt p <dig> accumulation that occurs with overexpression of mt p <dig>  we had previously demonstrated that overexpression of exogenous mt p <dig> by lentiviral stable insertion caused a concomitant increase in endogenous wt p <dig> in hme <dig> cells  <cit> . this accumulation of endogenous wt p <dig> occurs as a result of interaction with the more stable mt p <dig> protein. the wt and mt p <dig> molecules form heterotetramers and the average ratio of wt and mt p <dig> in these heterotetramers was 1: <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this report describes the binding and transactivation effects of wt p <dig> alone, as well as mt/wt p <dig> heterotetramers, which would simulate a heterozygous mt/wt state.

mutations of the p <dig> dna binding domain can be divided into two groups  <cit> . structure mutations are amino acid residue changes that cause perturbation of the structure of the dna binding surface of p <dig> protein. contact mutations are replacements of amino acid residues that normally make direct contact with the dna. according to this classification, of the  <dig> mt p <dig> investigated in our study, r175h and r249s are structure mutations whereas r273h and r280k are contact mutations.

the structure mt r175h did not show any dna binding on our promoter microarray, and we conclude that the altered conformation of this mt p <dig> protein likely affects the conformation of the entire mt/wt heterotetramer and completely compromises its binding to dna. the changes in histone acetylation we observed in this mt are therefore most likely the secondary effects of overexpression of mt p <dig> protein and not a direct effect of mt p <dig> binding to dna. the mt protein with changed structure possibly forms new interactions with other proteins. effect of r175h mt could be also caused by preventing the binding of wt p <dig> to sites that are occupied under normal conditions. however, the relative occupancy of p <dig> target sites in untreated hme <dig> cells is so low, if any, that it was not detected by our chip on chip analysis as statistically significant.

the structure mt r249s bound only  <dig> promoters  and did not invoke any changes in histone acetylation. the contact mt r273h bound  <dig> promoters  and induced nearly no changes in histone acetylation. the r249s and r273h mutants severely compromised p <dig> dna binding, only allowing 1–2% of wt p <dig> binding. this data likely explains why we did not detect many changes in histone acetylation in these two cell lines.

the contact mt r280k retained the highest dna binding of the four mutants tested in our study. interestingly, it bound only to promoters with a high basal level of histone acetylation and many of these targets appear to be non-specific as they were not bound by wt p <dig>  this observation suggests that this p <dig> mt has altered dna binding activity and prefers regions of highly acetylated histones, i.e. actively transcribed chromatin. this binding is probably not specific to any particular target dna sequence. additionally, binding of this mutant did not cause many changes in histone acetylation, possibly because of the fact that it bound only promoters that were already highly acetylated.

of the four mutants tested in our study, the structure mutants r175h and r249s had more compromised dna binding than the contact mutants r273h and r280k. this could be the result of more severe changes in protein structure. however, the level of p <dig> protein in cells overexpressing the structure mutants r175h and r249s was about 2/ <dig> that seen in the r273h and r280k  <cit> . so, lower levels of p <dig> protein causing lower dna binding can not be completely excluded. nonetheless, our experimental data show that the binding of p <dig> in the four mutant expressing cell lines was highly compromised in comparison with binding of wt p <dig> 

we detected significant increases and decreases in histone acetylation in response to wt p <dig> overexpression. however, consistent with wt p <dig> function as a transcriptional activator, we found mostly increases in histone acetylation overlapping p <dig> binding. this overlap between promoters that were bound by wt p <dig> and those that showed significant increases in acetylation of either histone h <dig> or h <dig> was highly significant. the overlapping group, however, formed only about 20% of the bound promoters. the remaining 80% of the bound promoters showed no significant changes in acetylation, however, most of these promoters were already highly acetylated in untreated cells so that a further increase due to p <dig> binding was impossible or undetectable as significant.

the high proportion of promoters with increase in histone acetylation without p <dig> binding  may be due to the limited region covered by microarray probes. p <dig> can bind much further upstream than the region covered by the probes on the promoter microarray . for example p <dig>  one of the best known p <dig> responsive genes, has two p <dig> binding sites located  <dig>  and  <dig>  kbp upstream of transcription start  <cit> . therefore, the microarray used in this study is able to detect changes in acetylation in the transcriptional start regions of such genes, but, if p <dig> binding occurs several kbp up or down stream, this microarray could not detect this event. finally, many genes with changed acetylation without detected p <dig> binding may also be secondary targets, downstream on the p <dig> regulated response pathway.

with one exception, we have not detected any significant decreases in histone acetylation for the promoters bound by p <dig>  these results are not in complete agreement with other published in some other studies  <cit>  where a decrease in histone acetylation was observed at some p <dig> target genes. this apparent discrepancy could be due to differences in models employed , the fact that not all transcriptional down regulation is linked to histone deacetylation, and the different analytical tools employed in the individual studies. for example, using a dna sequencing strategy, wei et al  <cit>  observed that the p <dig> binding sites of genes that are transcriptionally activated tend to cluster around the transcriptional start of the gene. by extension p <dig> binding sites in targets of transrepression may have a tendency to occur at regions removed from promoter regions, and therefore would not be detected by the human gene promoter microarray we employed. alternatively, p <dig> transrepression and associated histone deacetylation may occur through protein-protein interactions that do not involve direct binding of p <dig> to dna  <cit> , and therefore would not be effectively detected using chip-based approaches.

our study revealed several potential new p <dig> target genes. we have tested the expression of selected candidates in response to p <dig> overexpression by real-time rt-pcr. according to our data, the genes syk, gdf <dig>  dgkz, and fbxo <dig> are direct p <dig> targets demonstrated by chip on chip analysis and realtime rt-pcr analysis, which have not been described before. there are numerous studies suggesting that syk  acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and human melanoma as its overexpression inhibits invasiveness of both types of tumors  <cit> . gdf <dig>  has been shown to reduce the invasiveness of breast cancer cells  <cit> . suggesting that syk and gdf <dig> are tumor suppressor genes is consistent with our observation that they are direct p <dig> transcriptional targets. dgkz  binds prb and overexpression of dgkz in prb-null fibroblasts reconstitutes a cell cycle arrest induced by gamma-irradiation  <cit> . participation in cell cycle arrest is consistent with being a p <dig> target. fbxo <dig>  belongs to the family of f-box proteins  <cit>  which are one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligases. f-box proteins thus comprise the specificity of substrate for ubiquitination. the fbxo <dig> could, therefore, be involved in degradation or inactivation of specific proteins in response to p <dig> induction. therefore we conclude that the novel p <dig> targets have functions consistent with the tumor suppressive activity of their regulator wt p <dig> 

overall, we observed binding of induced wt p <dig> to almost two hundred gene promoters including known and novel wt p <dig> targets. binding of wt p <dig> in about 20% of cases was accompanied by increased histone acetylation followed by increased expression. we did not observe any significant decreases in histone acetylation directly driven by wt p <dig> binding. the mt p <dig> highly compromised p <dig> binding to dna when expressed on a wt p <dig> background. therefore, there were no direct changes in histone acetylation and no changes in dna methylation observed in these cell line models.

CONCLUSIONS
wt p <dig> when overexpressed from adenoviral vector in hme <dig> cells bound  <dig> promoters of the human gene promoter microarray. p <dig> binding resulted in statistically significant increases in histone acetylation of either histone h <dig> or histone h <dig> or both for  <dig> of these promoters. we observed no decreases in histone acetylation for genes bound by p <dig>  so we conclude that wt p <dig> targets are biased towards gene activation. from these studies we identified and validated a number of new direct transcriptional targets of wt p <dig> including dgkz, fbxo <dig> and gdf <dig> 

the p <dig> mutants r175h, r249s, r273h, and r280k, when overexpressed in hme <dig> cells with a wt p <dig> background, showed no or highly compromised dna binding relative to a comparable level of wt p <dig> alone. this supports a dominant negative effect of mt p <dig> on the wt p <dig> protein. there were very few changes in histone acetylation observed in cells overexpressing mt p <dig> with the most occurring in the r175h mutant. we observed no changes in dna methylation in response to long-term expression of mt p <dig>  in summary the mt p <dig> inhibited binding of wt p <dig> resulting in blocking of wt p <dig> epigenetic actions.
