BACKGROUND
the once dominant focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms  has given way to the recognition of a wide variety of abundant structural variants, including large and small copy number variations  in dna from human and chimpanzee  <cit> , a range of vertebrate  <cit>  and invertebrate species such as candida albicans  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , as well as the malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum  <cit> . cnvs range from relatively small  to more than a megabase, and include deletions, insertions, duplications/amplifications, gene conversions, and products of non-allelic homologous recombination ; affecting more total base pairs than snps  <cit> . studies in humans and other mammals demonstrate the critical role of cnvs in generating phenotypic diversity, and disease  <cit>  emphasizing the need to assess, catalogue, and understand the full spectrum of these variants. recent studies comparing cnvs between various primate species support a contribution of cnvs to human evolution  <cit> ; however, the role of cnvs as a source for selection has traditionally been overshadowed by the assumption that cnvs carry a high fitness cost due to altered gene dosages  <cit> . in addition to altered gene dosage, cnvs can impact genome function by disrupting coding sequences and by exerting long range  influence on gene expression  <cit> .

although the earliest evidence for the impact of a cnv linked to phenotypic variation was discovered seventy years ago in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , cnvs have been understudied largely due to the difficulties in identifying large structural polymorphisms and the presumed significance of snps in generating phenotypic diversity. the advent of comparative genomic hybridization   <cit>  and the expansion of this technique with new microarray platforms  <cit>  provide rapid discovery and high-resolution, genome-wide views of cnvs.

it is well known that an abundance of structural polymorphisms in malaria parasites contribute to phenotypic diversity. chromosome size polymorphisms have been identified in various geographical isolates, in vitro drug selections and controlled genetic crosses by pulse field gel electrophoresis   <cit> . duplications and inter-chromosomal transpositions of chromosome segments are thought to contribute to novel phenotypes  <cit> ; chromosomal anomalies, e.g. the amplification of the pfmdr <dig>  locus on chromosome   <dig>  <cit> , and the deletion of the kahrp  locus on chr  <dig>  <cit>  have been studied widely for their key roles in drug resistance and cytoadherence, respectively. more recently, cnvs in p. falciparum have been studied in field isolates and laboratory adapted lines using various cgh platforms  <cit> . these initially relied on expression microarray designs targeting open reading frames , while more recent experiments use densely tiled probe sets across the genome  <cit> .

despite the growing catalog of cnvs for various organisms, relatively little is known about their origins, stability, and inheritance. the rate at which new variants arise and/or revert to their original state, and their distribution in the genome remain largely unknown  <cit> . cnvs arising de novo are postulated to occur frequently in mammalian genomes  <cit> , sometimes at higher rates than point mutations  <cit>  and account for a more significant amount of human genetic variation  <cit> . a deeper understanding of cnvs, including their origins and maintenance as well as their phenotypic effects, will improve our understanding of their adaptive relevance to parasite phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence.

haploid progeny parasite clones derived from a genetic cross between two parent clones  with distinct drug-selection histories was central to mapping the molecular determinant of chloroquine  resistance  <cit>  and several other complex trait loci  <cit> . inheritance of traits and associated variant loci can be tracked genetically using a dense linkage map  <cit> . here we examine genome structure using cgh with a custom,  <dig>  feature microarray hybridized with genomic dna from parents and  <dig> progeny of the cross. we use relative co-hybridized signal intensities between each progeny and the hb <dig> parent dna to identify cnvs and to track their inheritance or emergence as de novo events within progeny lines. many cnvs segregated in the expected mendelian fashion, while a surprising number of cnvs appeared as de novo events in one or more progeny clones. notably, these structural genome variants spanned many genes. we assessed their potential impact on genome-wide transcription, highlighting the likely important role for cnvs in parasite evolution and adaptation.

RESULTS
genome-wide frequency of copy number variants
we investigated genome wide distribution, frequency and characteristics of cnvs within a segregating population of progeny derived from a genetic cross between a multidrug resistant and a generally drug sensitive parasite  <cit> . we focused on cnvs of approximately  <dig> kb or larger, with at least  <dig> probe signals supporting the cnv call.

one-hundred and seventy cnvs were detected in at least one parent or progeny clone, affecting  <dig>  mb of the  <dig> mb genome and involved 10% of all genes . figure 1a illustrates the genome-wide distribution of cnvs and their frequency in the progeny population. a complete catalogue of the cnvs  is provided in additional file  <dig>  using a stringent cnv calling algorithm , we detected  <dig> of  <dig> cnvs reported by one group  <cit>  and  <dig> of  <dig> reported by another group  <cit>  in the hb <dig> and dd <dig> parent clones . these cnvs include loci linked to drug resistance : amplifications in pfmdr <dig>   <cit>  and gch <dig>   <cit> ; cytoadherence and gametogenesis : a deletion on chr  <dig> in hb <dig>  <cit> , a deletion overlapping the kahrp gene in dd <dig> on chr  <dig>  <cit> ; and the duplication of a segment on chr  <dig> in hb <dig>  <cit> . a  <dig>  kb deletion on chr  <dig> in dd <dig> was not detected in any of the progeny. individual progeny genomes carried a median of  <dig> cnvs, approximately two cnvs per chromosome, with more gains  than losses  .

categories of cnvs
two major categories of cnvs were defined in the progeny: segregating cnvs were detected in at least one of the parental lines and in at least one of the progeny; cnvs not detected in either parent but observed in one or more progeny were termed 'de novo'. a de novo cnv occurring in a single progeny was sub-designated 'singleton' while de novo cnvs which occurred in multiple progeny but in neither parent was sub-designated 'recurrent' de novo .

forty-five segregating cnvs ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb affecting  <dig> % of the genome  and  <dig> genes were identified ;  <dig> of these  <dig> genes were members of polymorphic gene families. in addition to the expected segregating genomic cnvs,  <dig> de novo cnvs were identified :  <dig> singleton , and  <dig> recurrent in which the same or similar breakpoints were called in at least  <dig> progeny . thirty-nine of  <dig> recurrent de novo cnvs were scored in  <dig> or  <dig> progeny. four cnvs were observed in  <dig> or more progeny and their inheritance pattern indicated that they are probably segregating cnvs .

each progeny gained an average of  <dig> de novo cnvs, including both singleton and recurrent; notably, these events were concentrated in some progeny , while a single progeny carried none  . most de novo cnvs  were ≤  <dig> kb . four of the de novo cnvs were >  <dig> kb: a  <dig> kb amplification in progeny clone 7c <dig> on chr  <dig> ; a  <dig> kb amplification in tc <dig>  on chr13; a  <dig> kb amplification in progeny clone 7c <dig> on chr  <dig> ; and a  <dig> kb deletion in 7c <dig> on chr  <dig>  . approximately  <dig> % of the genome  was affected by de novo cnvs. of the recurrent de novo cnvs, 55% involved genome regions containing polymorphic genes. given these three classes of cnvs, we investigated the functional categories of genes that were enriched within the different classes. the most significant  enrichments are reported in additional file  <dig>  genes implicated in drug response, fat metabolism, cytochrome c-heme linkage, aromatic compound biosynthetic process and regulation of dna replication were enriched in segregating cnvs. carbohydrate metabolism, meiotic recombination and gamete production were detected as highly significant within the de novo cnvs. in all categories of cnvs, pathogenesis, rosetting, cell-cell adhesion, cytoadherence to microvasculature and antigenic variation were enriched, as expected, due to preponderance of polymorphic gene families among the cnv regions.

cnv chromosomal locations
cnvs were detected across all  <dig> chromosomes, spanning  <dig>  mb  of the genome and overlapping  <dig> genes. for distributional analysis, chromosomes were divided into  <dig> equal segments and regions were assessed for any biases in cnv counts and categories . segregating cnvs were observed more frequently in the distal chromosome segments , than were de novo cnvs  . singleton de-novo cnvs were distributed chromosome-wide and did not show a regional bias .

previous studies proposed amplification/deamplification hotspots  <cit>  and fragile genomic regions  <cit>  in p. falciparum. we evaluated this possibility by examining distribution of the cnv boundaries in our dataset, assuming a random distribution model. a  <dig> kb non-overlapping window analysis was used to scan the genome-wide distributions of all  <dig> breakpoints . under random expectation,  <dig> or more breakpoints within a  <dig> kb region was highly significant . this analysis revealed  <dig> candidate hotspots for cnv breakpoints: one each in chrs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and two each in chrs  <dig> and  <dig> . all candidate hotspots coincided with regions containing polymorphic gene family members . given that all hotspots were detected in the telomeric/subtelomeric regions, we also looked specifically for hotspots in other regions of the genome. we did not identify additional candidate hotspots in the non-telomeric/subtelomeric regions at high stringency, but did observe  <dig> positions with two or more breakpoints per  <dig> kb .

linkage and inheritance of cnvs
a population of segregating sibling parasite clones provides a unique opportunity to track the inheritance patterns of amplifications and deletions. we examined cnvs for mendelian inheritance, in which case the cnv would be expected to behave as any genetic marker by being inherited in approximately half the progeny clones along with the local allele of its parent of origin, i.e. statistically linked to neighboring markers and mapping to that unique genome location. using the microsatellite  linkage map  <cit>  cnvs were evaluated for co-inheritance with known markers throughout the genome. in addition, we used the relative hybridization signals of each cnv as a phenotype for quantitative trait loci  mapping . all  <dig> segregating cnvs were detected at a minimum score of lod  <dig> , localizing each to its expected parental allele segment. twenty-seven of  <dig> segregating cnv display a highly significant cis qtl signal  mapping to a nearby ms marker . furthermore, by scoring cnvs in the context of their linkage relationships we were able to discover complex subclasses of cnvs . closer examination of the segregating cnvs that were detected only at the lower significance threshold  revealed several reasons for weaker signal: cnvs with highly skewed inheritance in the progeny population ; loci with overlapping or neighboring cnvs in the parents ; and complex multiallelic cnvs, i.e. region overlapping a mixture of amplified as well as deleted regions in the parent genomes or de novo cnv region overlapping a segregating cnv region in at least a single progeny .

inferring mechanisms and cnv origins
to assess possible mechanisms that generate cnvs and their origins, we examined the parental ms inheritance in the regions of both segregating and recurrent de novo cnv loci across the progeny. we found no evidence for divergence from mendelian expectation for segregating cnvs , simply showing that segregating cnvs tended to be inherited within their expected allele context, i.e. neighboring markers from the same parent of origin. two of  <dig> segregating cnvs were perfectly co-inherited with the nearby ms. on the other hand, although strong association with the genotype was evident for the remaining segregating cnvs, it was not perfectly so, with at least a single progeny displaying an allele change in overlapping or neighboring region due to a crossover between the cnv locus and the nearest ms, or due to a local gene conversion overlapping the cnv region detectable only at fine-scale resolution as demonstrated by the examples described below .

we inferred from local allele inheritance patterns that several cnvs in the progeny were generated as complex products of recombination. two segregating cnvs previously implicated in parasite drug resistance, on chrs  <dig> and  <dig>  were mapped to their expected reference genome position. however, in the case of the cnv overlapping the chr  <dig> pfmdr <dig> locus, not all progeny inheriting the dd <dig> pfmdr <dig> allele carry the same number of copies as the dd <dig> parent . of  <dig> progeny inheriting the dd <dig> pfmdr <dig> allele, only  <dig> have the same  <dig> copies as the parent; most  progeny with the dd <dig> allele have lost at least one copy . one progeny with the hb <dig> allelic background gained a copy of this locus. in two progeny it could be determined from the parental ms markers allele inheritance pattern that a copy was lost during homologous recombination in meiosis . however, most progeny did not display complex recombination products at this locus that would confirm a meiotic homologous recombination origin. it is probable that in the absence of homologous allele exchange, sister chromatid exchange in mitosis or meiosis could have generated the changes in copy number.

the chr  <dig> amplification carrying the gch <dig> locus also demonstrated a complex inheritance pattern in the progeny. each parent carries a different version of an amplified locus : the dd <dig> parent harbors a ~ <dig> kb amplicon , while hb <dig> harbors a ~ <dig> kb amplicon . all progeny were amplified at this locus, and one progeny clone, ch3- <dig>  uniquely inherited a mixture of the different parental cnvs . linkage analysis of the cnv region in ch3- <dig> shows that a broad hb <dig> genome segment surrounds a small dd <dig> allelic segment, indicating that either a double crossover or gene conversion could have generated this segment . given the genome-wide recombination rate  and the size of the physical genome segment affected , gene conversion is more likely than a double crossover.

as demonstrated for the recombination products of the pfmdr <dig> and gch <dig> locus, in some cases it is possible to demonstrate meiotic origin by examining the distribution of allelic genetic markers across the genome region of the cnv for its parental origins. such diagnostic genetic markers require that the parent lines differ for the particular genomic region and that a mapped ms is present in that region, which is often not the case given the genome-wide ms density of  <dig> marker per  <dig>  kb. when parental alleles are not distinct, it is not possible to distinguish the specific type of recombination event that led to the cnv change. higher marker density provides the resolution to observe local genetic exchange that results in cnv. to investigate the origin of de novo cnvs in meiosis, we checked all de novo cnvs for their underlying allelic inheritance using the genotype information in the published linkage map  <cit> . to improve the resolution to  <dig> marker per  <dig> kb, we also used our recently published snp allele dataset derived from sequencing the progeny clone 7c <dig>  <cit>  to search for evidence of homologous crossover or gene conversion at regions of de novo cnv. with this high snp allele resolution analysis, we characterized two examples of de novo cnvs  in 7c <dig>  and confirmed gene conversion as one potential mechanism by which de novo cnvs are generated. the elucidation of precise mechanism will require sequence analysis at cnv breakpoints. for example, whole genome sequencing can systematically identify cnv breakpoints and determine the source of the template for the repair and resolution of genetic exchange events.

given the large fraction of recurrent cnvs, we examined these more closely to confirm this classification. at the resolution revealed by cgh, exact breakpoints cannot be determined. consequently, we considered various ways recurrent cnvs can be present; for example some of these may be segregating cnvs that were not detected in the parent cgh. we checked the hybridization signal profiles of all recurrent cnv regions in the parents and assessed all previous work in the parents for cnvs which were not detected in our data but were detected in previously published work that used a range of microarray platforms and probe densities  <cit> . using this approach we identified  <dig> de novo cnvs that upon visual inspection exhibited characteristics of segregating cnvs. they were missed by our cnv calling algorithm because of their complex nature: for example, presence of overlapping or closely neighboring cnvs in both parents in the cnv region . these loci are detected as de novo cnvs by the cnv calling software due to variation in hybridization signal in the progeny. in seven of the recurrent cnvs, progeny inherited a mixture of a de novo cnv adjoining a segregating cnv , and therefore was classified as a de novo cnv.

recurrent mutations could also occur from low-level subclones within the parent lines used to generate gametes for the cross. this was tested by assessing whether certain de novo cnvs co-occur in specific progeny lines reflecting the simultaneous introgression of several cnvs in association with their underlying genetic markers. we did not observe any examples of simultaneous introgression of a subset of de novo cnvs that would indicate co-inheritance from a parent subclone. in 37/ <dig> of recurrent de novo cnvs, surrounding segments from each parental genome was detected among the progeny with cnv, indicating independent origins . twenty-three of the  <dig> recurrent cnvs were in the context of a single parental genome segment, suggesting either: 1) the cnv is actually a segregating cnv that was missed  in one of the parent lines; 2) a subclone exists in the parent population that carries the particular cnv and thus 'partially' segregates; or 3) the particular genome segment specific to one parent is a hotspot for de novo cnvs. it is important to note that for all  <dig> cases at least one progeny clone inheriting that parent genome segment did not carry the cnv.

the emergence of cnvs in the asexual phase of the parasite life cycle establishes that cnvs can be generated during mitosis in p. falciparum  <cit> . to assess if some of the de novo cnvs could have occurred during culture adaptation or cloning during the generation of the genetic cross, we compared genes in de novo cnvs with those previously reported from field isolates, laboratory adapted lines or culture adapted lines . we observed  <dig> genes in common with previous studies. incidentally we do not observe rh <dig>  commonly observed to emerge during culture adaptation. we note membrane protein genes , duffy binding-like merozoite surface protein gene, plasmodium exported protein genes , an abc transporter , hexose transporter, dna/rna-binding protein alba , gbph <dig>  histidine-rich protein  iii, antigen proteins  and members of polymorphic gene families  among the genes that are common with the de novo cnvs.

we also explored the use of qtl to map mechanisms that regulate copy number in the progeny of the genetic cross. this approach used the cnvs as traits with the expectation that qtl loci can reveal gene variants that influence the tendency for different progeny to generate cnvs. for this analysis, we considered de novo amplifications and deletions, calculated as a percentage of the total number of events per progeny as distinct phenotypes. we did not detect any qtl loci at the lowest threshold associated with de novo amplifications. however, for de novo deletions we detected a suggestive qtl on chr <dig> . the locus includes a putative transcription factor tfb <dig> , a subunit of transcription/dna repair factor tfiih, that has been implicated in dna damage response, nucleotide excision repair  <cit>  and chromosome fragility  <cit> .

segregation distortion of cnv regions
more than half of the segregating cnvs were inherited in the expected 1: <dig> mendelian ratio among the progeny. segregation distortion was observed for  <dig> of the  <dig> segregating cnvs . this included  <dig> cnvs  that were highly skewed: 1) chr  <dig> sub-telomeric deletion of the kharp  locus, deleted in dd <dig> and 86% of progeny; 2) chr  <dig> sub-telomeric locus, deleted in hb <dig> and all progeny; 3) chr  <dig> sub-telomeric locus, deleted in hb <dig> and 77% of progeny; 4) chr  <dig> locus, deleted in hb <dig> and 91% of the progeny); 5) chr  <dig> sub-telomeric cnv, amplified in hb <dig> and 86% of the progeny; and 6) chr  <dig> amplification of the gch <dig> locus, amplified in both parents, and higher copy number than hb <dig> in 97% of the progeny, at the gch <dig> locus . five of these agree with the previously reported regions of segregation disparity proposed to reflect the survival advantage of favored haplotypes during the generation of the hb <dig> × dd <dig> cross  <cit> .

impact of cnvs on gene expression
we integrated a previously generated gene expression data set for the hb <dig> × dd <dig> genetic cross with the current cgh data to assess the impact of cnv on gene expression. qtl mapping of transcript abundances as quantitative traits identified both local regulatory effects  and distant effects   <cit> . both segregating and de novo cnvs showed an impact on the expression of resident genes . of the  <dig> genes impacted by cnvs,  <dig> resided in segregating cnv. these cnvs extensively influenced the inherited levels of transcription of the genes residing within the cnv , as well as distant  genes, than would be expected by chance. for example,  <dig> of the genes residing in  <dig> segregating cnvs were differentially regulated locally, indicating strong local regulation due to altered gene dosage. an additional  <dig> genes scattered throughout the genome were regulated in trans by loci that coincided with segregating cnvs. this implies that a gene residing in the cnv has an effect on downstream transcripts either directly as a regulatory protein, or indirectly through physiological or signaling role. amplifications were the predominant cnv that influenced transcription via both cis and trans mechanisms. several loci influenced the expression of a large number of genes, and were identified as regulatory hotspots  <cit> . five of the  <dig> eqtl hotspots aligned with segregating cnvs: three in chr  <dig>  one in chr  <dig> and one in chr  <dig>  one of the hotspots in chr  <dig>  and one in chr  <dig>  correspond to amplifications implicated in resistance to known antimalarial drugs.

discussion
recent studies of p. falciparum demonstrated the widespread prevalence of cnvs in populations and their likely adaptive influence on important traits such as drug resistance  <cit> . large scale amplification and deletions have been known for several decades  <cit> . however, a precise understanding of genome plasticity, origins of cnvs and their stability, including transient and reversible fluctuations in a generational time-frame is deficient not only for the malaria parasite, but for other organisms as well  <cit> . for example, little is known about the behavior of copy number variant regions, the rate of reversion to an original state, the rate at which new variants arise, and the uniformity of the distribution of new variants in a sibling population. the segregating population examined in this study provides an ideal context in which to view the inheritance and stability, and occasionally to infer the origin of a cnv. we report extensive plasticity and segregation complexity of cnvs within the progeny.

three different classes of cnvs - segregating, singleton de novo and recurrent de novo - were prominent in this study and are contrasted here for their inheritance patterns among progeny clones . among these three classes, we observed duplications, deletions and multiallelic complex loci, as has been described for cnvs in human  <cit>  and chicken  <cit>  . we observed many de novo cnvs . information on de novo cnvs has been scarce because previous studies did not examine parent-progeny populations. with the availability of suitable genetic systems along with high-throughput technologies which enable genome wide discovery of cnvs, it is clear that de novo cnvs are an important source of genetic variation  <cit> . furthermore, de novo events are not unprecedented in p. falciparum. duplication of subtelomeric sequence has been documented previously in progeny of different genetic crosses including the hb <dig> × hb <dig> self cross  <cit> . previous development of the ms linkage map revealed non-canonical ms markers in the hb <dig> × dd <dig>  <cit>  and non-parental sequence products in the hb <dig> × 3d <dig>  <cit>  as well as the hb <dig> × dd <dig>  <cit>  genetic crosses, further emphasizing the genome plasticity of the parasite both at smaller  as well as larger  scales of sequence.

our data provide clear evidence for copy number differences from the parent lines within the segregating progeny population. most of the previously known segregating cnvs exhibited a mendelian segregation pattern at a broad scale and mapped to markers close to their genome positions . however, finer scale scrutiny of two segregating cnvs implicated in drug resistance revealed unique structural changes resulting from meiotic recombination events. the chr  <dig> pfmdr <dig> amplification which has been associated with mefloquine resistance  <cit>  and is widely detected in natural parasite populations  <cit> , exhibited both loss and gain of copies compared to the parental state . this highlights that both amplification and deamplification mechanisms have affected the locus. similarly, the gch <dig> locus, postulated to be associated with antifolate resistance  <cit>  and widely detected in parasite populations  <cit> , also exhibited complex multiallelic copy number within a single meiotic generation . these examples illustrate the highly dynamic nature of cnv regions during a single meiotic generation that would not be recognized in a standard population-based cnv survey.

four mechanisms can generate cnvs and lead to fluctuation of copy number in the cnv regions: homologous recombination , non-allelic homologous recombination , non-homologous end joining  and the replication based mechanism, microhomology-mediated break-induced replication  - which includes fork stalling and template switching   <cit> . the absence of factors in the malaria parasite genome required for nhej combined with evidence for hr and nahr from both laboratory genetic crosses and field isolates argue that recombination mechanisms play a central role in generating genetic diversity in the parasite. consistent with previous reports, we demonstrate that recombination generates amplifications and deamplifications of both segregating and de novo cnvs. we show evidence of recombination detected by local allelic changes that resulted in copy number loss  and gain  in segregating cnvs and gain of de novo cnv . while chr  <dig> cnvs in two progeny clearly indicate hr origins, lack of evidence for reciprocal allele exchange in other progeny implies that most cnvs may appear due to unequal hr between sister chromatids. unequal sister chromatid exchange is postulated as a mechanism that generated the multiple independent events of the pfmdr <dig> cnvs within parasite isolates  <cit> . ms allelic changes at the chr  <dig> locus  in our data indicate copy number fluctuation by sister chromatid exchange, a double crossover or gene conversion. gene conversion has been reported to generate diversity within multigene families in p. falciparum  <cit> . duplication of chromosomal segments by gene conversion, including duplicative translocation, has been described in genetic crosses  <cit>  and parasite clones  <cit> . alternatively, complex multiallelic/mosaic regions can result from gene conversion which can change the cn profile from that of the parents  <cit> , an observation consistent with the several examples of de novo cnvs described in this study .

in general, it is difficult to establish cnv origins. the steps involved in generating a genetic cross include many opportunities for both sexual and asexual  genetic exchanges  <cit> . a more precise inference of mechanisms would benefit from knowledge of the number of mitoses that each parent lineage underwent prior to the generation of gametes for the cross, as well as the number of mitotic replication cycles that the parent and progeny parasites underwent after meiosis. although allelic marker co-inheritance can pinpoint homologous recombination as one origin of cnvs when sufficient sequence differences can distinguish the parental allele segments, this method cannot differentiate the cnvs generated in asexual replication or in genomic regions that are identical  in the parents.

while unlikely, it cannot be ruled out that recurrent mutation reflects parent subclone populations . although parasites were cloned by micromanipulation or limiting dilution, and it is generally accepted that this method would produce true single-clone parent lines, we are necessarily dealing with these 'individuals' as populations expanded in culture. therefore, it is possible that genetic changes arising in these cultured lines in preparation of gametes for the cross could contain mixed genotypes that are represented in the gametes which segregate into some subset of progeny clones. we found some recurrent de novo cnvs residing in both parent allele backgrounds that suggested independent origin. furthermore, we did not find evidence for simultaneous introgression of cnv, which should be readily apparent in the presence of two or more distinct parent subclones. overlap of several single as well as recurrent de novo cnvs with cnvs reported to have arisen under culture adaptation and/or in vitro culture, suggests that several de novo cnv regions may have emerged in culture adaptation  but cannot be precisely determined at cgh resolution.

we noted a preponderance of cnv breakpoints within narrow genomic regions, including recurrent de novo cnvs that impacted the same genome segments. genomic regions that show a high propensity for segmental duplications also have been suggested in isolates  <cit>  and laboratory lines  <cit>  of p. falciparum. additionally, previous work has also demonstrated extensive occurrence of deletions particularly in the subtelomeric sequences  <cit> , indicating that the subtelomeric regions may be highly unstable and represent fragile sites  <cit> . it has been postulated that specific sequence features may underlie the fragility of the subtelomeric regions  <cit> . recurrent structural mutation has been observed in mice  <cit>  and humans  <cit>  during inheritance. similarly, recurrent duplication has been detected previously in p. falciparum; especially in association with the subtelomeric regions in progeny of both the hb <dig> × dd <dig> and hb <dig> × 3d <dig> genetic crosses  <cit> , while recurrent subtelomeric deletions have been detected in independent clones of a field isolate  <cit> . several recent studies have demonstrated recurrent mutations as a key mechanism by which gene copy number fluctuations take place within short generational time scales  <cit> . these studies have emphasized that recurrent cnvs may be an important biological process in evolution, as well as human disease  <cit> .

skewed inheritance was observed for a majority of the segregating cnvs. skewed inheritance was expected to an extent, given that skewed inheritance of parental alleles were previously noted within this population for seven regions, mostly located in the sub-telomeres, during construction of the ms linkage map  <cit> . consistent with the expectation from ms linkage analysis, five of the cnv regions overlapped with the skewed allele distributed regions in the ms map, emphasizing the role of cnvs in parasite selection. the skewed regions overlap with genes associated with parasite pathogenicity  <cit> , gametogenesis  <cit>  and drug resistance  <cit> . regions of skewed inheritance have been observed not only in the hb <dig> × dd <dig> genetic cross  <cit> , but also in other independent genetic crosses  <cit> . it has been suggested that the skewed inheritance may be related to the selection of alleles beneficial for parasite viability, growth and proliferation in a splenectomized chimp during the generation of the genetic cross and/or in parasite growth under in vitro growth conditions  <cit> . if deletions are eliminated by selection, populations that emerge in culture should carry more amplifications than deletions. this trend was observed in the progeny clones carrying more gains than losses .

the stability and fitness of cnv loci is postulated to play an important role due to their implication in resistance to antimalarials  <cit> . previous work supported a co-adaptive role of pfmdr <dig> copy number with the cq resistance gene pfcrt. inheritance of these loci in the progeny clones of the hb <dig> × dd <dig> has suggested an influence on fitness due to the presence of specific combinations of alleles that exist among the progeny. it was observed that high pfmdr <dig> copy number is maintained only in the context of its co-selected mutant pfcrt partner and cq sensitive pfcrt is never paired with  <dig> copies of pfmdr <dig>  <cit> . two groups indirectly evaluated the in vitro dynamics and possible fitness effects of cnv in p. falciparum  <cit> . both attempted to address the fitness effects at a single cnv locus, in the presence and absence of drug pressure, using a single strain of p. falciparum. each proposed a fitness cost associated with carrying the multicopy cnv as indicated by the out-growing of the single copy over the multicopy parasite in a mixture of parasites. mathematical modeling of in vitro based experimental data suggested a cnv emergence rate of  <dig> in  <dig> parasites  <cit> . the rate of emergence in the population is ultimately a reflection of the rate of de-amplification as well as parasite growth dynamics due to fitness costs associated with carrying higher copy numbers.

emergence of cnv under in vitro conditions have been reported widely in p. falciparum with laboratory adaptation  <cit> , under long term laboratory culture  <cit>  and under drug pressure  <cit> . it has been widely postulated that parasites have fewer constraints during in vitro culture conditions such that growth advantages can be gained from decreased investment in activities such as protein exportation, knob construction, display of cytoadhesive molecules and variant antigens, and production of gametocytes  <cit> . the overlap we observed of de novo cnvs with some of these genes is consistent with the interpretation that culture adaptation and cloning could be associated with lost functions via deletions.

along with extensive chromosomal size variation identified previously by pfge  <cit> , our data demonstrate a highly plastic genome with strong potential to influence function through gene dosage effects. we explored the potential functional impact of cnvs. functional enrichment analysis of the de novo cnvs revealed genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, recombination and gametogenesis; while segregating cnvs involved drug response, fat metabolism, aromatic compound biosynthetic processes and regulation of dna replication in p. falciparum. in both segregating and de novo cnvs, functions of polymorphic gene families were represented. the presence of functional gene families has been taken as an indication of positive selection on gene duplications over time  <cit> . gene duplication is now recognized as an important mechanism for evolution of new biological functions in organisms  <cit> . cnvs in humans are enriched for genes involved in molecular interactions to specific environmental stimuli including drug detoxification, immune response, cell surface integrity and surface antigens. it has also been postulated that cnvs could carry genes that contribute to inter-individual variation and can play a role in the differences in drug response and immune defense  <cit> , but not in intracellular processes such as biosynthetic and metabolic pathways  <cit> . the genome wide distribution of cnvs and the abundance and breadth of genes overlapping cnv regions, as well as their widespread involvement in local and distant gene regulation, indicate the extensive contribution of cnvs in phenotypic variation, similar to that observed in human studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we describe the breadth and distribution of genome-wide cnvs detected in a segregating parasite population and a more dynamic genome structure than has been reported previously for malaria parasite populations. we highlight cnvs arising de novo in the progeny clones. the classical genetic framework provided a unique opportunity to examine the mendelian behavior of cnv regions, including the identification of allele segregation patterns that indicate mechanisms that generate cnvs. we also directly tested the impact of cnvs on gene expression by overlaying eqtl and report widespread effects of local and distant regulation. by using a segregating genetic system to study the breadth, distribution and dynamics of cnvs, we reveal an extremely plastic parasite genome in which cnvs are a prominent source of diversity and maybe an overlooked substrate for selection.
