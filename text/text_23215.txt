BACKGROUND
sugars are universal nutrients that provide carbon skeletons for energy production, storage and the synthesis of most metabolites. in plants, the main sink of carbon is the cell wall  <cit> , a dynamic structure that provides both rigidity to support the plant and plasticity to allow cell growth. there is extensive knowledge of the enzymes involved in the synthesis and assembly of cell wall polysaccharides , but relatively little is known about how environmental stimuli and photosynthate availability contribute to cell wall formation during cell growth.

sugars can act as both metabolic intermediates and as signaling molecules  <cit> , and treatment of plants with sugars promotes growth. one mechanism linking sugar availability and growth promotion is the stimulation of auxin synthesis by exogenous sugars  <cit> , which may indirectly influence cell wall formation by promoting cell elongation. sugar levels may also link cell wall formation with the maintenance of turgor pressure. mutations in a gene encoding a cell wall-associated kinase , which is required for normal cell expansion, also exhibited reduced vacuolar invertase activity  <cit> . this led to an increased dependence of seedlings on exogenous sugars for maintaining turgor and growth, and indicated that waks may be involved in maintaining the balance between turgor pressure, which drives cell expansion, and cell wall formation. a similar link between turgor and cell walls was shown by interrupting cellulose synthesis and observing that the resulting stress responses and distorted cells were rescued by osmotic support and sugar availability  <cit> . the interaction between sugar signaling and cell wall integrity control was also highlighted by the sugar hypersensitivity of several cell wall matrix structural mutants mur <dig>  mur <dig> and mur <dig>  <cit> . the hsr8- <dig>  allele of mur <dig>  which is defective in udp-arabinose synthesis, exhibits sugar hypersensitive gene expression and growth responses  <cit> . the pleitropic regulatory locus <dig>  mutation was identified as a suppressor of hsr8- <dig> sugar hypersensitivity phenotypes. prl <dig>  encodes a wd <dig> protein that is a component of a spliceosome complex, and prl <dig> mutations have multiple complex phenotypes that include sugar hypersensitivity  <cit> . these findings suggest that impaired cell wall composition may be actively sensed, leading to transcriptional responses that modify cell wall composition and growth  <cit> .

recently, the existence of such transcriptional regulators controlling cell wall integrity and plant growth was demonstrated  <cit> . the stunted growth and lignin deficiency of the lignin deficient mutant ref <dig> was restored by the disruption of two subunits of the transcriptional regulatory complex mediator, med5a and med5b. here we show that the med25/pft <dig>  and med <dig>  two other subunits of the mediator transcription complex, are able to suppress the sugar hypersensitive short hypocotyl and gene expression phenotypes of the hsr8- <dig> mutant. we show that these mediator subunits are required for the altered expression of a set of genes encoding cell wall components and biosynthetic activities in the hsr8- <dig> mutant  <cit> . we show that one of these subunits, med25/pft <dig>  is also required for the coordinated induction of several sugar-responsive genes, including those encoding cell wall modifying enzymes. these results suggest the med <dig> and med <dig> subunits of the mediator complex have an integrating role by linking sugar responsive- and cell wall- gene expression.

RESULTS
identification of a novel suppressor of hsr8- <dig> sugar hypersensitive growth
the high sugar response8- <dig> mutant, which has reduced cell wall arabinose  <cit> , displays a range of sugar hypersensitivity phenotypes  <cit> . among these, dark grown hsr8- <dig> seedlings show reduced hypocotyl elongation in response to glucose in comparison to wild-type plants, and light-grown seedlings show hypersensitive sugar-regulated gene expression and anthocyanin content. to identify possible mechanisms linking altered cell wall composition and sugar responses, we screened for suppressors of the short hypocotyl phenotype of the hsr8- <dig> mutant. we grew m <dig> seedlings of a fast neutron mutagenized hsr8- <dig> population in the dark in the presence of glucose for 14 days and screened for individuals with longer hypocotyls. eight suppressors of hsr8- <dig>  were isolated, several deletions were genetically mapped, and the soh715hsr8- <dig> recessive mutant was selected for further analysis. figures 1a and b show the intermediate hypocotyl length of the soh715hsr8- <dig> suppressor mutant compared to wild- type col and hsr8- <dig>  the hsr8- <dig> sugar hypersensitive phenotypes, increased β-amylase  mrna accumulation and anthocyanin content were also suppressed in the soh715hsr8- <dig> mutant, with bam mrna accumulation and anthocyanin content reduced in hsr8- <dig> to lower levels than in wild-type plants . these results show that the soh <dig> mutation suppresses hsr8- <dig> sugar hypersensitive phenotypes.fig.  <dig> identification of a suppressor of hsr8- <dig> sugar-hypersensitive hypocotyl elongation in the dark. a image of sugar hypersensitive hypocotyl elongation of col, hsr8- <dig> and hsr8-1soh <dig> grown on 1 % glucose on vertical plates in the dark. b quantitative measurements of hypocotyl lengths of col, hsr8- <dig> and hsr8-1soh <dig>  seedlings were grown vertically in the dark for 14 days on ms medium with 1 % glucose. errors bars represent sd . ***, p <  <dig>  comparing col to hsr8- <dig> and hsr8- <dig> to soh <dig> hsr8- <dig> . data shown is representative of three independent experiments. c quantitative real-time pcr analysis of β-amylase mrna levels in col, hsr8- <dig> and the hsr8-1soh <dig> repressor in response to glucose. seedlings were grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig>  % glucose in constant light. after 7 days, seedlings were transferred 24 h in a ms glucose-free liquid medium and then treated for 6 h with 3 % ms medium containing 3 % glucose. errors bars represent sd from three biological replicates. data shown is representative of three independent experiments. **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to hsr8-1; ***, p <  <dig>  comparing hsr8- <dig> to soh <dig> hsr8- <dig> . relative transcript levels  were calculated using transcript levels of the reference gene tub <dig> . d anthocyanin accumulation in response to glucose in col, hsr8- <dig> and hsr8-1soh <dig>  seedlings were grown in continuous light for 7 days on ms medium containing 1 % glucose  or 3 % glucose . errors bars represent sd from three biological replicates. **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to hsr8-1; ***, p <  <dig>  comparing hsr8- <dig> to soh <dig> hsr8- <dig> . data shown is representative of two independent experiments



soh <dig> is allelic to the pft1- <dig> mutation
to map the soh <dig> locus in the columbia ecotype, the double mutant was crossed with wild-type landsberg erecta. to isolate soh715hsr8- <dig> double mutant plants, long hypocotyl plants were selected in the f <dig> population and genotyped to identify hsr8- <dig> homozygous plants. double soh715hsr8- <dig> mutants comprised 1/4th of the segregating population instead of the expected 1/16th. preliminary genetic analysis  showed the soh <dig> locus mapped to a region of chromosome  <dig> where hsr <dig> also maps, confirming that the soh <dig> and hsr8- <dig> mutations may be genetically linked. a transcript-based cloning approach  <cit>  was then used to identify deletions in the mapped region. gene expression in hsr8- <dig> and soh175hsr8- <dig> seedlings was assessed using the ath <dig> gene chip. comparison of gene expression levels revealed that  <dig> consecutive genes on chromosome  <dig> showed strongly reduced rna levels in soh715hsr8- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig> . this result, taken together with the preliminary genetic mapping data, indicated that a deletion encompassing  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> suppressed the hsr8- <dig> phenotype. to identify the gene involved, we complemented the soh715hsr8- <dig> mutant background with  <dig> genomic fragments, each containing one gene and flanking regions in the deleted locus. only the genomic fragment containing at1g <dig> restored the hsr8- <dig> short hypocotyl phenotype . the suppression of hsr8- <dig> dark development phenotype in the soh715hsr8- <dig> mutant is therefore caused by the deletion of at1g <dig>  encoding the med25/pft <dig> protein  <cit> . to confirm this observation a double mutant between hsr8- <dig> and a loss-of function t-dna insertion allele in at1g <dig> called pft1- <dig> was analysed. when grown in the dark in the presence of glucose, the hsr8-1pft2- <dig> double mutant displayed the same intermediate hypocotyl length as soh715hsr8- <dig> . increased accumulation of bam transcripts and anthocyanins in hsr8- <dig> in response to glucose treatment was suppressed by the pft1- <dig> mutation . figure 2f shows that pft1- <dig> also suppresses elevated glucose- responsive apl <dig> expression in the glucose hypersensitive mutants hsr <dig>  <cit>  and hsr <dig>  which is a mis-sense mutation in the arp <dig> subunit of the arp2/ <dig> complex. therefore loss of pft <dig> gene function suppressed the hsr8- <dig> hypocotyl cell elongation defect and sugar hypersensitive gene expression.fig.  <dig> 
hsr8- <dig> sugar hypersensitive phenotypes are suppressed by the pft1- <dig> mutation. a identification by microarray analysis of a cluster of six genes that are down regulated in the suppressor line soh715hsr8- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig>  values on the y-axis are those obtained after normalization of the entire microarray data set. dark grey bars and light grey bars represent values obtained for the hsr8- <dig> mutant and the hsr8-1soh <dig> suppressor line respectively. b sugar hypersensitive dark development of col, hsr8- <dig>  soh715hsr8- <dig> and soh715hsr8- <dig> complemented with each of the  <dig> genes of the deletion. seedlings were grown vertically in the dark for 14 days on ms medium containing 1 % glucose. only the genomic fragment containing the at1g <dig> gene rescued the dark development phenotype. c sugar hypersensitive dark development of col, hsr8- <dig>  the double mutant hsr8-1pft1- <dig> and pft1- <dig>  seedlings were grown as described in  above. d quantitative real-time pcr analysis of β-amylase mrna levels in col, hsr8- <dig> and the double mutant hsr8-1pft1- <dig> in response to glucose. seedlings were grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig>  % glucose in constant light. after 7 days, the seedlings were transferred for 24 h to ms glucose-free liquid medium and then treated for 6 h with ms medium containing 3 % glucose. errors bars represent sd from three biological replicates. data shown is representative of three independent experiments. **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to hsr8-1; ***, p <  <dig>  comparing hsr8- <dig> to hsr8- <dig> pft1- <dig> . relative transcript levels  were calculated using transcript levels of the reference gene tub <dig> . e anthocyanin accumulation in response to glucose in col, hsr8- <dig> and the double mutant hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  seedlings were grown in continuous light for 7 days on ms medium containing 1 % glucose  or 3 % glucose . errors bars represent sd from three biological replicates. data shown is representative of two independent experiments. **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to hsr8-1; ***, p <  <dig>  comparing hsr8- <dig> to hsr8- <dig> pft1- <dig> . f quantitative real-time pcr analysis of the sugar-responsive apl <dig> gene mrna levels in col, hsr <dig>  pft1-2hsr <dig>  hsr <dig>  pft1-2hsr <dig> and pft1- <dig> in response to glucose. hsr <dig> and hsr <dig> are sugar-hypersensitive mutations in subunits of the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit> . seedlings were grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig>  % glucose in constant light. after 7 days, the seedlings were transferred to glucose-free liquid ms medium for 24 h and then treated for 6 h with ms medium containing either 0 % glucose  or 3 % glucose . errors bars represent sd from three biological replicates. **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to hsr <dig> and col to hsr4; ***, p <  <dig>  comparing hsr <dig> to hsr <dig> pft1- <dig> and hsr <dig> to hsr <dig> pft1- <dig> . relative transcript levels  were calculated using transcript levels of the reference gene tub <dig> 



cell wall composition is altered in pft1-2
figure 3a shows that reduced hypocotyl elongation in hsr8- <dig>  and its suppression by pft1- <dig>  was due to changes in cell length and not in cell number. the suppression of the short hypocotyl phenotype in hsr8- <dig> by pft1- <dig> was not due to changes in cell wall monosaccharide composition, as the hsr8-1pft1- <dig> double mutant had the same reduced levels of arabinose as hsr8- <dig> . additional analyses of cell wall composition of hypocotyls of dark-grown col, hsr8- <dig>  hsr8-1pft1- <dig> and pft1- <dig> mutants seedlings were conducted using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy   <cit> . figure 3c shows difference spectra relative to wild-type col, and principle components analysis  identified three principle components when mapped as score loadings . pc <dig> explained ~80 % of the variation in cell wall composition between genotypes, showing very broad variation across the spectra with positive loadings between  <dig> and 1200 cm- <dig> and depletion at 1200-1800 cm- <dig> relative to columbia. although pc <dig> and pc <dig> explained less variation , these principle components identified variation in more specific spectra between genotypes. in pc <dig>  the positive loading between  <dig> and 1097 cm- <dig> may reflect variation in xyloglucan and pectin respectively between genotypes  <cit> . pc <dig> identifies positive loadings between  <dig> and 1776 cm- <dig>  possibly reflecting differences in waxes and phenolic composition  <cit> . additional file 1: figure s <dig> are scatter plots comparing pc <dig>  pc <dig> and pc <dig> between the mutants. there were significant differences between each of the genotypes for each of the three pcs.fig.  <dig> comparison of cell elongation and cell wall composition in col, hsr8- <dig>  pft1- <dig> and hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  a hypocotyl cell length was measured from scanning electron micrograph images. n =  <dig> cells each from  <dig> hypocotyls. **, p <  <dig>  comparing hsr8- <dig> to col, and hsr8- <dig> to pft1- <dig> and hsr8- <dig> pft1- <dig> . b monosaccharide composition of cell wall material isolated from 14 day old light grown seedlings . fuc fucose; rha rhamnose; ara arabinose; xyl xylose; man mannose. . ***, p <  <dig>  comparing arabinose levels in col to hsr8- <dig>  and pft1- <dig> to hsr8- <dig> pft1- <dig> . c compositional analysis of cell wall material isolated from dark grown hypocotyl tissues using ftir. the data are represented as differences in relative absorbance from wild-type col. d principal components analyses of ftir data. score loadings of pc <dig>  pc <dig> and pc <dig> are plotted against the range of wavelengths to show the major variance



suppression of hsr8- <dig> by pft1- <dig> is not dependent on the phya, phyb or jasmonate pathways
med25/pft <dig> was first identified as a positive regulator of flowering in response to sub-optimal light conditions, and pft <dig> mutants display slightly longer hypocotyls in far red light and a late flowering phenotype in long days  <cit> . as mutants with longer hypocotyls were identified in our screen, and because phya has been implicated in sugar responses  <cit> , we assessed the role of phytochrome signalling pathways in the suppression of hsr8- <dig> sugar hypersensitivity. neither the phya- <dig>  <cit>  nor the phyb- <dig>  <cit>  mutations suppressed the hsr8- <dig> dark development phenotype . seedlings were also grown under constant white light  and constant far-red light  to confirm that the phya-201hsr8- <dig> and phyb-1hsr8- <dig> double mutants displayed characteristic phya and phyb phenotypes, unlike the pft1-2hsr8- <dig> double mutant.fig.  <dig> 
pft <dig> acts independently of phya and phyb and the jasmonate response pathway in the suppression of the hsr8- <dig> hypocotyl elongation phenotype. a sugar-hypersensitive dark development of col, hsr8- <dig>  hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  phya-201hsr8- <dig>  phyb-1hsr8- <dig> mutants. seedlings were grown vertically in the dark for 14 days on ms medium containing 1 % glucose. b hypocotyl phenotypes of col, hsr8- <dig>  hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  phya-201hsr8- <dig>  phyb-1hsr8- <dig> mutants grown in white light. seedlings were grown 7 days on ms sugar free medium under constant white light. c hypocotyl phenotypes in far-red light of col, hsr8- <dig>  hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  phya-201hsr8- <dig>  phyb-1hsr8- <dig> mutants. seedlings were grown 4 days on ms sugar free medium under constant far-red light. d sugar hypersensitive hypocotyl elongation of col, hsr8- <dig>  coi1-16hsr8- <dig> mutants. seedlings were grown as in 



pft <dig> is a regulator of the jasmonate  signalling pathway  <cit> . as cell wall defects can trigger defence responses through the jasmonate signalling pathway  <cit> , we tested whether ja-dependent defence responses were activated in hsr8- <dig> and if pft1- <dig> suppressed hsr8- <dig> sugar hypersensitivity through the ja signalling pathway. expression of vsp <dig>  vsp <dig> and erf <dig>  which are strongly up regulated by ja, was not up- regulated in hsr8- <dig> compared to col in dark-grown seedlings . this showed that the ja pathway was not induced in hsr8- <dig> in response to its cell wall defect. crosses to the ja- insensitive mutant coi1- <dig>  <cit>  confirmed this; the coi1-16hsr8- <dig> double mutant had the same short hypocotyl phenotype as hsr8- <dig> . therefore suppression of the hsr8- <dig> short hypocotyl phenotype by pft1- <dig> is independent of its role in the ja and phytochrome signalling pathways.

microarray analysis of pft1-2-dependent gene expression
pft <dig> encodes subunit  <dig> of the mediator complex, a conserved regulator of transcription in eukaryotes  <cit> . we therefore assessed the extent to which pft <dig> controls gene expression in response to glucose in light grown seedlings, and also how it controls gene expression during dark development in col and hsr8- <dig> genetic backgrounds. for glucose-responsive gene expression, three independent replicates of pft1- <dig> and wild-type light-grown  <dig> day old seedlings were collected 6 h after 3 % glucose or 0 % glucose treatment. two-way anova   revealed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to 3 % glucose in col and  <dig> genes in pft1- <dig> , of which  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to glucose in both genotypes. a total of  <dig> genes had fold changes between - <dig> and + <dig>  and  <dig> genes were induced > <dig> fold by glucose in wild-type col. nineteen of these showed no significant glucose- dependent induction in pft1- <dig> and  <dig> showed strongly reduced glucose- dependent induction in pft1- <dig> . the expression of five general categories of genes were either completely or partially dependent on pft <dig> for increased expression in response to glucose. expression of six genes involved in the regulation, biosynthesis and transport of anthocyanins required pft <dig>  including the central regulator myb75/pap <dig>  <cit> . five genes encoding uptake transporters of nitrate, phosphate and sulphate, and the phosphate uptake regulator spx <dig>  also required pft <dig> for increased expression in response to glucose  <cit> . seven genes encoding enzymes  in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates required pft <dig> for their expression in response to glucose. of the four myb transcription factor genes involved in regulating glucosinolate  biosynthesis  <cit> , myb28/hag <dig> required pft <dig> for increased expression. thirteen genes encoding a wide variety of stress responsive genes required pft <dig> for expression in response to glucose. these include two cor -related genes, nced <dig> involved in aba biosynthesis, the afp <dig> gene encoding an abi <dig> binding protein, the heat-shock transcription factor hsfa <dig>  a pirin gene involved in aba signaling, bzip <dig> involved in regulating proline dehydrogenase, and eca <dig> encoding an er ca2+ transporter involved in stress responses. finally, several genes encoding proteins involved in cell expansion required pft <dig> for their glucose-responsive expression, including two lipid transfer proteins  involved in membrane modifications, and expansin  <dig>  which is involved in cell wall extension  <cit> .fig.  <dig> microarray analyses of gene expression in col, hsr8- <dig>  pft1- <dig> and hsr8-1pft1- <dig> seedlings. a venn diagram of glucose- induced genes in col and pft1- <dig>

to confirm and extend these microarray analyses, we measured the influence of pft <dig> on the expression of a small set of well- characterised glucose-responsive genes identified previously in microarray experiments  <cit> . q-rtpcr analysis showed that the glucose-induced genes apl <dig>  bam, gbss <dig>  gpt <dig> and pdc <dig> all had reduced expression in pft1- <dig> , and confirmed the microarray data showing reduced expression of apl <dig> and bam. the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway  was also assessed by q-rtpcr, and they all showed reduced expression in pft1- <dig> . finally, anthocyanin levels were reduced to 45 % of wild-type levels in pft1- <dig> , confirming the important role of pft <dig> in the expression of regulators and enzymes of anthocyanin synthesis.

gene expression in 14-day old dark-grown seedlings of col, hsr8- <dig>  hsr8-1pft1- <dig> and pft1- <dig> was measured in three independent rna samples using microarray analysis. two-way anova analysis  identified  <dig> genes that were ≥ <dig> fold up- or down- regulated in hsr8- <dig> compared to col, and  <dig> genes were differently regulated between hsr8- <dig> and hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  there were  <dig> genes in common that were differentially regulated in hsr8- <dig> vs col and hsr8- <dig> vs hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  these genes were clustered according to their expression patterns . of the  <dig> genes that were significantly down- regulated in hsr8- <dig> compared to col and up- regulated in pft1-2hsr8- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig> ,  <dig> encode proteins involved in cell wall formation, cuticle formation and cell expansion. these include xth <dig> and xth <dig>  encoding xyloglucan endo-transglycosidase/hydrolase enzymes that cleave and re-arrange xyloglucans  <cit> ), and irx <dig> encodes a xylosyl transferase involved in xylan synthesis  <cit> . expb <dig> and exp <dig> encode the cell wall proteins expansin b <dig> and expansin  <dig> that promote cell wall expansion, cer <dig> encodes an enzyme of cutin formation, fla <dig> encodes a fascilin-type arabinogalactan protein involved in cell adhesion, rtm encodes a mannose-binding lectin, and jal <dig> encodes an er-golgi transporter that may be involved in the transport of cell wall components to the plasma membrane. the expression of three genes encoding peptidases involved in programmed cell death in xylem, xcp <dig>  xcp <dig> and the metacaspase-encoding gene mc <dig> was reduced in hsr8- <dig> and increased in hsr8-1pft1- <dig>  similarly the expression of two stress-induced genes, hva <dig> and gstu <dig> encoding glutathione-s-transferase, was reduced in hsr8- <dig> compared to col, and increased in hsr8-1pft1- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig> 

the expression of a diverse set of  <dig> genes was increased in hsr8- <dig> compared to col and decreased in hsr8-1pft1- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig> . these genes required pft <dig> for their increased expression in hsr8- <dig>  three members of the light-dependent short hypocotyl  gene family, encoding conserved nuclear proteins of the alog  family of transcription factors  <cit> , and five genes encoding enzymes of methionine- and aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit>  required pft <dig> for increased expression in hsr8- <dig>  three genes encoding the cell wall hydroxyproline rich glycoprotein extensin  <dig>  laccase involved in lignin biosynthesis, and β-glucosidase  <dig> also required pft <dig> for increased expression in hsr8- <dig> compared to col. finally hkt <dig>  encoding a protein involved in sodium retrieval from xylem, was expressed in a similar pattern.

to extend these analyses, q-rtpcr analyses of genes encoding cell wall components and enzymes with increased expression in hsr8- <dig> compared to col  <cit>  was carried out in the double mutant pft1-2hsr8- <dig>  these analyses showed that increased expression in hsr8- <dig> of ext <dig>  ext <dig>  encoding cell wall glycoproteins, and pme <dig> and pme <dig>  encoding pectin methylesterases, was reduced in hsr8-1pft2- <dig> , confirming the increased expression of ext <dig> seen in microarray data and extending the range of cell wall-related genes requiring pft <dig> in hsr8- <dig> 

med <dig> is also required for the expression of selected genes encoding cell wall components but is a repressor of glucose-induced gene expression
the mediator complex in arabidopsis is composed of at least  <dig> subunits  <cit> , therefore we examined other subunits in addition to pft1/med <dig> for a potential role in sugar- and cell elongation- mediated gene expression. med <dig> mutants exhibited similar phenotypes to pft1- <dig> with respect to pathogen responses, flowering time and organ size  <cit> . furthermore, the yeast homolog of med <dig> was shown to be involved in sugar signalling  <cit> . to test the involvement of med <dig>  hsr8- <dig> was crossed with a loss of function t-dna insertion med <dig> mutant, and hypocotyl length in dark developed seedlings was analysed. as shown in fig. 6a, med <dig> suppresses the hsr8- <dig> short hypocotyl phenotype to the same extend as pft1- <dig> . we therefore measured expression of the same set of four pft1-responsive cell wall- related genes shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> in hsr8- <dig> and med8hsr8- <dig> in dark grown seedlings. figure 6b and c shows that expression of two of these four, pme <dig> and pme <dig>  was substantially reduced in med8hsr8- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig>  analysis of glucose- induced gene expression in light- grown med <dig> seedlings showed an opposite effect to that observed in the pft1- <dig> mutant: the med <dig> mutant significantly enhances expression of three genes with well-characterised responses to glucose, bam, apl <dig> and chs . this increase was consistently less in the double mutant med8pft1- <dig> in the analysed genes, suggesting that med <dig> and pft <dig> have opposing effects on glucose-induced gene expression.fig.  <dig> the med <dig> subunit plays a role in sugar responsive growth and gene expression. a sugar hypersensitive dark development of col, hsr8- <dig>  med8hsr8- <dig> and med <dig> mutants. seedlings were grown vertically in the dark for 14 days on ms medium containing 1 % glucose. b and c quantitative real-time pcr analysis of mrna levels of cell wall modifying encoding genes pme <dig> and atpme <dig> in col, hsr8- <dig>  med8hsr8- <dig> and med <dig>  seedlings are grown as described in  above. errors bars represent sd from three biological replicates. **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to hsr8- <dig>  and med <dig> hsr8- <dig> to med <dig> . relative transcript levels  were calculated relative to the transcript level of the reference gene tub <dig> . d to f quantitative real-time pcr analysis of bam, apl <dig>  and chs mrna levels in col, med <dig>  pft1- <dig> and the double mutant med8pft1- <dig> in response to glucose. seedlings were grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig>  % glucose in constant light. after 7 days, the seedlings were transferred to glucose-free liquid ms medium for 24 h and then treated for 6 h with 3 % glucose. errors bars represent sd from three biological replicates. **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to med <dig> and pft1- <dig> to med <dig> pft1- <dig> ; **, p <  <dig>  comparing pft1- <dig> to med <dig> pft1- <dig> ; **, p <  <dig>  comparing col to med <dig> and pft1- <dig> to med <dig> pft1- <dig>  . relative transcript levels  were calculated using transcript levels of the reference gene tub <dig> 



discussion
a genetic screen for mutants that suppressed the short hypocotyl phenotype of dark-grown hsr8- <dig> seedlings identified eight soh mutants. one mutant, soh715hsr8- <dig>  had an intermediate hypocotyl length when grown in the dark  and also suppressed hypersensitive responses to glucose as assessed by gene expression and anthocyanin accumulation . the elongated cotyledonary petioles seen in hsr8- <dig>  <cit>  were also partly suppressed by the soh <dig> locus , but the main phenotype studied was the large difference in hypocotyl elongation, which was shown to be due to increased cell elongation . soh <dig> was identified as pft <dig>   <cit> , encoding a subunit of the mediator transcription complex  <cit>  and confirmed by the double mutant hsr8-1pft1- <dig> , which was used in subsequent analyses. pft <dig> mutants exhibit longer hypocotyls in response to phytochrome-mediated signals  <cit> , increasing signalling downstream of phya and genetically interact with hy <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the dark-development phenotypes of hsr8- <dig> were not dependent on phya or phyb, and hsr8- <dig> did not significantly influence white- and far- red light responses. furthermore, the dark development phenotypes of hsr8- <dig> were not dependent on jasmonate responses  <cit> . we concluded that pft1-mediated suppression of reduced hypocotyl elongation in hsr8- <dig> was not dependent on pft <dig> functioning as part of phytochrome- and ja- mediated responses, suggesting pft <dig> functions through a independent mechanism to reduce hypocotyl cell elongation during dark development of arabinose-deficient mutants.

the mediator complex is a functionally conserved regulator of gene expression composed of approximately  <dig> subunits, forming a complex that docks transcription factors bound to enhancers with core promoter components such as rna polymerase ii  <cit> . mediator also has a structural role in chromatin by forming a complex with cohesin that is associated with chromatin looping of promoters  <cit> . pft1/med <dig> forms part of the tail region of the complex that interacts with transcription factors, while med <dig> is part of the head region interacting with core promoter components  <cit> . in metazoans, many diverse transcriptional regulatory networks converge on mediator  <cit> , with increasing evidence that different transcription factors interact with different subunits of the tail region. in plants, pft1/med <dig> and med <dig> are required for expression of ja-responsive and fungal resistance genes  <cit>  and have antagonistic effects on organ size  <cit> . pft1/med <dig> is also required for drought-responsive gene expression  <cit>  and is also directly involved in light responses and promoting flowering  <cit> . the mediator subunits med5a/5b repress expression of a set of phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthetic genes  <cit> , and it was suggested that med5a/5b may play a direct role in relieving growth repression caused by the phenylpropanoid mutant ref8- <dig> through a cell wall sensing pathway.

cluster analyses were conducted to identify two sets of genes in dark grown seedlings that were differentially regulated in hsr8- <dig> compared to col and in pft1hsr8- <dig> compared to hr8- <dig>  these sets comprise genes that required pft <dig> for increased or decreased expression in hsr8- <dig> dark grown seedlings. of the  <dig> genes with reduced expression in hsr8- <dig> compared to col, and increased expression in hsr8-1pft1- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig>  ten encoded proteins involved in cell wall formation . their expression profile shows that the expression of these genes is actively reduced in arabinose- deficient cell walls by pft <dig>  where they may limit cell wall expansion and/or compensate for altered cell wall composition. among these are genes for xyloglucan chain modification   <cit> , and xth <dig> which has xyloglucan endotransferase- hydrolase activity  <cit>  involved in wall strengthening and expansion in response to shade cues  <cit> . expression of genes encoding expansins  <dig> and b <dig> was also repressed by pft <dig> in hsr8- <dig>  these cell wall proteins promote cell wall extensibility, possibly by loosening xyloglucan-cellulose interactions  <cit> .

fourteen genes encoding regulatory proteins, biosynthetic enzymes and the cell wall protein extensin  <dig> had significantly elevated expression in hsr8- <dig> compared to col, and reduced expression in hsr8-1pft1- <dig> compared to hsr8- <dig> . the expression of three genes encoding lsh <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  members of the alog family of transcriptional regulators, was coordinately increased in hsr8- <dig> in a pft1-dependent pattern. over-expression of lhs <dig> led to reduced hypocotyl cell elongation  <cit> , suggesting that pft1-mediated expression of lsh family members may directly reduce hypocotyl cell elongation in hsr8- <dig>  the increased expression of extensin  <dig> and extensin  <dig> in hsr8- <dig>  was dependent on pft <dig>  suggesting that the deficient cell walls in hsr8- <dig> mutants may be strengthened by extensins, and that the reduced expression of extensin  <dig> and extensin  <dig> in hsr8-1pft1- <dig> may contribute to increased cell wall extensibility associated with cell elongation.

in col plants with normal cell walls, pft <dig> was required for the increased expression of seven genes encoding proteins that are involved in cell wall extension and cell elongation in response to high glucose levels: expansin  <dig> encodes a protein that loosens the wall by disrupting hydrogen bonds between cellulose and xyloglucan hemicelluloses  <cit>  and ltp <dig> and ltp <dig> encode proteins implicated in cell membrane deposition and cell wall loosening  <cit> . pif <dig> and pif <dig> activate ltp <dig> and expansin b <dig> gene expression and promote cell elongation  <cit> , and phyb negatively regulates this in the light. this is consistent with the known role of pft <dig> in phyb responses  <cit>  and suggests pif <dig> and pif <dig> may function in concert with pft <dig> to promote cell elongation in response to light and glucose cues by activating ltp and expansin gene expression.

glucose levels strongly influence plant growth, and a key feature of glucose-mediated transcriptional responses involves the rapid coordinated expression of genes encoding enzymes and transporters involved in nutrient acquisition and the synthesis of secondary products and the co-expression of genes involved in aba responses  <cit> . microarray analyses identified diverse classes of genes whose glucose-induced expression was fully or partly dependent on pft1/med <dig>  these genes encoded cell wall- and cell expansion- related proteins, regulatory proteins and enzymes of anthocyanin, flavonoid and glucosinolate biosynthesis, regulators and transporters involved in nutrient uptake, aba signaling and biosynthetic proteins, and a variety of stress-responsive proteins . seven genes encoding enzymes and regulatory proteins in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates  <cit>  required pft <dig> for increased expression in response to glucose. in the hsr8- <dig> mutant pft <dig> was also required for the expression of five genes encoding enzymes of glucosinolate synthesis, with mam <dig> commonly regulated by glucose. the function of glucosinolate production in hsr8- <dig> is not known, but the independence of pft1-mediated hsr8- <dig> phenotypes on ja indicates that stress responses may not be involved  <cit> . notably, glucose-induced expression of myb <dig>  encoding a key anthocyanin pathway regulator  <cit>  was completely dependent on pft <dig>  recently med5a and 5b have been shown to repress phenylpropanoid pathway gene expression  <cit> , establishing the central role of mediator in integrating biosynthetic capacity in response to increased carbon supplies. finally the pft1- dependent expression of genes encoding nitrate, phosphate and sulphate transporters  <cit> , and the phosphate uptake regulator spx <dig>  further demonstrate an important coordinating role for pft1/med <dig> in balancing nutrient supplies and carbon availability.

reduced pft <dig> function did not reconstitute wild-type cell wall arabinose content in hsr8- <dig>  as shown by cell wall monosaccharide analyses , probably because hsr8- <dig> is a loss of function allele of mur <dig>  which encodes the only known enzyme of udp-arabinose synthesis in arabidopsis  <cit> . only large reductions in cell wall arabinose and fucose led to reduced hypocotyl elongation in the dark  <cit> , which was rescued by low concentrations of borate. borate cross-links rhamnogalacturonan ii and is thought strengthen the cell wall, suggesting changes in cell wall composition and structure lead to reduced elongation in hsr8- <dig>  <cit> . analyses of cell wall polysaccharides using ftir spectra of cell wall material from dark-developing hypocotyls showed complex quantitative changes in absorbance spectra in hsr8- <dig> compared to wild-type col, and in hsr8-1pft1- <dig> compared to pft1- <dig> and col . although there were significant differences between genotypes the major component of these differences showed variation across a broad range of wavelengths that precluded identification of specific polysaccharides with altered levels.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses demonstrate a central role med <dig> and med <dig> subunits of the arabidopsis mediator complex in transcriptional responses involved in cell elongation, multiple biosynthetic pathways, stress responses, and nutrient acquisition in response to altered carbon availability.
