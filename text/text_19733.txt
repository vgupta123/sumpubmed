BACKGROUND
adult bone marrow is a widely used source of mesenchymal stem cells  that can be isolated and expanded in culture while keeping the ability to form adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts  <cit>  and possibly other cell types including cardiomyocytes  <cit> . within the bone marrow, msc may interact with hemopoietic stem cells , which reside in a specific microenvironment formed by various stromal precursor cells and osteoblasts, called the niche  <cit> . whether msc reside in the same niche amidst hsc or whether they dwell in a specific niche is presently unknown. different types of niches for hemopoietic progenitors may exist depending on their more or less primitive state  <cit>  located near bone surfaces away from blood vessels and therefore submitted to a low o <dig> tension. it is thus inferred that stem cells are equipped to survive in a hypoxic environment and that this condition plays a role in the maintenance of multipotency  <cit>  and extension of survival  <cit> . this may hold true for murine and human msc as their proliferation, differentiation and survival  <cit>  are affected by culture in low o <dig> tension. however the degree and duration of hypoxia described in the literature vary greatly and may result in opposite effects on the proliferation and differentiation capacities of msc  <cit> . so far one study described the long term  effect of human msc culture under low o <dig> tension  and showed improved survival and increase in adipocytic and osteogenic differentiation capacity  <cit> . in the present study we cultured human msc in normoxia  versus hypoxia  for up to passage  <dig>  and compared their morphology differentiation potential and mrna expression at early and late passages. we observed that cells cultured under low o <dig> tension were more undifferentiated than cells cultured in normoxia. further, hypoxia inhibited the expression of genes involved in dna replication and cell division at p <dig>  at p <dig>  however, gene ontology  analysis revealed that only one significant functional group of genes was stimulated and related to "plasticity". we conclude that culture in hypoxia maintains msc in a multipotent, undifferentiated state.

RESULTS
the effect of hypoxia on msc expansion and phenotype
bone marrow mononuclear cells  were cultured and passaged until p <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  both the cfu-f numbers and the mean colony size were significantly smaller at p <dig> in 5% o <dig>  versus 21% o <dig> . this diminution was however less significant at p <dig> , and at p <dig> the numbers of cfu-f were enhanced by hypoxia. in other experiments, cells were trypsined and counted, total cell numbers were diminished in hypoxia versus normoxia at p <dig> whereas they were enhanced at p1; the overall cell doubling/day was diminished by hypoxia until p <dig> and augmented afterwards .

in parallel, immunostaining and flow cytometry were performed at various time points. msc were negative for cd <dig> and cd <dig> and positive albeit variably for several other markers . in brief, cultured cells displayed a typical msc profile with stable phenotype overtime and no significant phenotypic differences between hypoxic and normoxic conditions in agreement with others  <cit> . only stro- <dig> was transiently expressed on 50% of the cells at p <dig> under hypoxia and diminished thereafter as expected from previous observations  <cit> . in brief, after a lag phase during which the hypoxic cells grew slower than normoxic cells, the former expanded faster in late passages. in contrast, with the exception of stro- <dig> which is dicussed in the relevant section, the phenotype of msc was not modified during culture expansion irrespective of the oxygen tension. we next looked for qualitative effects of hypoxia and investigated the morphology of msc by light and electron microscopy and evaluated the numbers of mitochondria in hypoxic versus normoxic cells.

culture of msc in hypoxia inhibited cell differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis
the number of mitochondria was evaluated by flow cytometry, by mitotracker staining and by transmission electron microscopy tem at p <dig>  under hypoxia and normoxia in  <dig> independent experiments. cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. the mean fluorescence intensity of hypoxic cells compared to normoxic cells was  <dig>  versus  <dig> on histograms . thus hypoxia did inhibit the biosynthesis of mitochondria. the same cells were also permeabilized and stained with mitotracker and analysed on fluorescence microscopy. as shown in figure 3b, normoxic cells looked brighter than the hypoxic ones. we observed a  <dig> to 75% inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis by counting the mitochondria on tem sections. strikingly, hypoxic cells looked less differentiated than normoxic ones. they displayed larger and less convoluted nuclei and more abundant nucleoli, and a higher nuclei/cytoplasm index, although the size of cells was very similar under both conditions .

long term hypoxia stimulated the differentiation of msc in adipocytes and osteocytes
msc were grown from the start in normoxia versus hypoxia until p <dig>  then washed and cultured in osteogenic or adipogenic lineage-specific media. the cells were kept in normoxia and hypoxia during the differentiation process. differentiated cells were characterized by conventional histology staining  and by rt-pcr for the amplification of lineage-specific transcripts for adipocytes  and osteocytes , respectively. the later transcripts were investigated in msc at p <dig> before they were cultured in differentiating conditions. as shown from  <dig> independent experiments in figure 4b, the expression of alpl was stronger in hypoxic msc than in normoxic cells. further, while runx <dig> transcription was undetectable in normoxic msc, it was induced in hypoxic cells. this suggested that hypoxic cells were more prone to osteogenic differentiation than normoxic cells. we indeed observed that hypoxic msc generated more  osteogenic and adipogenic colonies, than normoxic msc .

msc from  <dig> distinct donors were cultured in normoxic and in hypoxic conditions. the cells from each donor/condition were harvested at p <dig> and p <dig>  rnas were extracted thereafter, processed and hybridization with microarrays was performed in  <dig> independent experiments. comparative analysis of transcriptome from msc cultured at p <dig> in hypoxia versus normoxia revealed  <dig> dysregulated genes , of which  <dig> were up regulated  and  <dig> were down regulated . go analysis performed on the  <dig> dysregulated genes revealed an over-representation of genes  involved in dna metabolism  and/or coding for nuclear proteins . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  had a 2- <dig> fold decreased expression with the range  corresponding to nav <dig> and rrm <dig> genes respectively. figure  <dig> and table  <dig> summarize the analysis and showed the ten first down regulated genes after short culture in hypoxia. contrary to down regulated genes, we showed no significant go over-representation for up regulated genes. nevertheless, we could observe a strong trend of over representation for genes coding for membrane receptors  and paracrine factors  with a range of over expression  corresponding to aldoc and tcf <dig> genes respectively. table  <dig> depicts the ten up regulated genes at p <dig> in hypoxia.

comparative analysis of transcriptome from msc cultured at p <dig> in hypoxia versus normoxia revealed  <dig> dysregulated genes, of which  <dig> were up regulated  and  <dig> were down regulated . gene ontology analysis performed on the  <dig> deregulated genes revealed an over-representation of genes involved in cell plasticity  and adhesion . when we increased the stringency of analysis by selecting genes that were 4-fold differentially expressed on  <dig> arrays, we eliminated genes for cell adhesion go term but not for plasticity. all these  <dig> genes characterizing plasticity go term were up regulated with a range between  <dig>  and  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the ten first up regulated genes after long term culture  in hypoxia. several transcripts were validated by quantitative, real time pcr  . the results matched that of the gene arrays with enhanced expression of hoxa <dig>  kit, wnt <dig>  oxct <dig> and inhibited expression of ccl <dig>  cx3cl <dig> under hypoxia.

discussion
hematopoietic and stromal stem cells adapt themselves to hypoxia in culture which probably reflects their native hypoxic microenvironment  <cit> . accordingly, several teams cultured hsc and msc in hypoxic conditions in order to study their differentiation capacity  <cit> . another goal of these experiments is the hope of expanding these cells while maintaining their "stemness" properties. although data from various laboratories are difficult to compare due to wide variations in oxygen tension, ranging from  <dig>  to 5%, and the duration of culture, ranging from a few hours to  <dig> months, a few studies evidenced an early growth inhibition under hypoxia  <cit> . hypoxia induces cell cycle arrest in mammalian cells, however stem cells are more resistant to hypoxia than their progenies again reflecting their natural environment and their intrinsic quiescent state. we performed msc cultures in 5% o <dig> which may be physiological for bone marrow stem cells  <cit> . as msc and hsc form a single bone marrow niche  <cit> , 5% o <dig> tension is likely to be physiological for msc as well. we observed that msc grew slower under 5% o <dig> than under 21% o <dig> until p <dig>  and gained a progressive growth advantage in the next passages, which matched previously published results  <cit> . meanwhile, hypoxic msc expressed more adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules in early and late cultures, contained less mitochondria and displayed undifferentiated morphological features. in brief, early growth inhibition was somewhat expected and strikingly, go analysis assigned down regulated genes to dna metabolism and repair , cell cycle progression  and chromosomal organization  in agreement with our data on proliferation and colony size. such inhibition likely contributes to the maintenance of msc in a quiescent state, inasmuch as the inhibition of mitochondria may protect msc from apoptosis. how could we reconcile these data with our observation that hypoxic msc gained a growth advantage over normoxic msc at late passages? the contradiction may be apparent. one possibility is that these cells became more sensitive to growth factors present in the serum. whether growth advantage is due to a stimulation of proliferation pathways or to the expression of receptors for cytokines and growth factors or both, is worth investigating. note in this respect that cxcr <dig> was induced by hypoxia.

as msc in their niche are supposed to be quiescent and multipotent, these properties are apparently dissociated in our in vitro model, with quiescence being observed at early passages, whereas multipotency is augmented at late passages. until we understand the in vivo signature of msc, we cannot draw conclusions and pretend that in vitro culture in hypoxia mimics the niche.

although expected from previous studies and suggested by our morphological observations, maintenance of stem cell characteristics at early passages under hypoxia was not inferred from go analysis. early induced genes were not assigned to multipotency but instead belonged mostly to adhesion molecules such as von willebrand endothelial cell adhesion molecule and protocadherin . however, several genes may clearly affect stemness. cd <dig> regulates the clearance of apoptotic cells, a function critical to development, maintenance of homeostasis and tissue repair  <cit> . the wnt-related transcription factor tcf <dig> may regulate msc and enhance their osteogenic differentiation  <cit> . at variance with the above genes,  <dig> genes potentially involved in the control of differentiation towards adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes  <cit>  were not modified by hypoxia . strong expression of adhesion molecules may be physiologically relevant and correlate with broader differentiation potential of hypoxic msc. indeed vwf is a marker of endothelial commitment  <cit>  and plvap, reported here for the first time in msc is a leukocyte trafficking molecule  <cit>  which may help transendothelial migration of msc from the bone marrow. stimulation of leptin is also meaningful as a recent work demonstrated that it helps maintain mesenchymal progenitor cells undifferentiated  <cit> . this result also shows that hypoxia impacts the metabolism of msc in agreement with a study on rat msc  <cit> . in this study however, the duration of hypoxia was  <dig> hours only. yet, several genes involved in adhesion and extracellular matrix were stimulated.

hypoxia generates "plasticity". at p <dig> in hypoxia, only one group of genes was stimulated and was assigned to plasticity. smoc <dig> is the first induced gene  and plays a role in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix assembly  <cit> , yet a recent article demonstrated that a related protein increases life span and fecundity in drosophila  <cit> . kit gene was induced thus correlating with proliferation  <cit> . lama1/laminin  <cit>  and sntg2/syntrophin gamma- <dig>  <cit>  are both involved in retinal and eye development whereas gpr <dig>  a seven-transmembrane domain protein, is involved in brain cortical patterning  <cit> .

we have observed that hypoxia stimulated several genes which converge to maintain the cells in an undifferentiated state, and facilitate transendothelial migration of msc . in parallel, hypoxia inhibited the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation . this transcription profile probably reflects the intrinsic genetic program of msc in vivo as these cells are quiescent, and endowed with migration and multilineage differentiation capacities. with respect to migration, note that cxcr <dig> was induced by hypoxia  with potential implications in the egress of msc from the bone marrow. this is in contrast with the cell surface phenotype of msc which was almost unaffected in our experiments and in others  <cit> . note however that stro- <dig> was expressed only transiently in cultured hypoxic but not in normoxic cells. this is not totally surprising since stro- <dig> expression is gradually lost during culture expansion  <cit> . even though stro- <dig> is useful to isolate msc from various tissues, it is not positive on all msc  <cit> . interestingly, stro-1+ cells displayed enhanced expansion and multilineage differentiation potentialities  <cit> . thus, the expression of stro- <dig> on hypoxic msc may not be fortuitous and reflects multipotential status.

our results may have physiological & medical applications. oxygen tension is a critical parameter, possibly the most important one, in the culture of stem cells. as nestin-positive msc and hsc form a unique bone marrow niche  <cit> , hypoxia is undoubtedly a physiological milieu for msc. in this respect it is worth mentioning that nestin was induced by hypoxia in our experiments . given the ever growing therapeutic applications of msc in regenerative medicine  <cit>  and in autoimmune diseases  <cit> , the impact of o <dig> on the functions of msc should be carefully evaluated. for instance, intravenous injection of msc results in their accumulation in the pulmonary parenchyma. although this was sufficient to treat experimental septic shock  <cit> , dissemination of msc into other organs may be necessary to treat systemic diseases; induction of molecules involved in transendothelial migration as observed in our experiments may be helpful in this setting. conversely however, hypoxia may be detrimental to other purposes. msc inhibit th <dig> cells in a ccl2-dependent manner by processing this chemokine to an antagonistic derivative, and may be helpful in the treatment of experimental allergic enkephalitis   <cit> . note in this respect that the transcription of ccl <dig> in msc was inhibited under hypoxia in our experiments. altogether our data demonstrate that hypoxia favoured the "undifferentiation program" of msc, it remains to evaluate the impact of hypoxia on each desired function of these cells in the event of medical applications.

as the holy grail is to use tissue-specific cells derived from msc in regenerative medicine, culture of msc in hypoxia at least until p <dig> in order to induce the expression of a broad range of tissue-specific genes, may be beneficial, inasmuch as it also enhanced the cell numbers in parallel to their differentiating capacity. in this respect differentiation experiments should be carried to evaluate the potential of msc to generate endothelial cells, myocytes and neurons. finally, the most relevant result here is the demonstration of induction of plasticity, a major property of msc, at variance with hsc  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the duration of hypoxemia is a critical parameter for the differentiation capacity of msc. hypoxia maintains the cells undifferentiated and in parallel enhances the expression of genes involved in the development of various, mesodermal and non mesodermal, cell lineages. in this respect hypoxia may increase both the multipotency and the transdifferentiation potential of msc.
