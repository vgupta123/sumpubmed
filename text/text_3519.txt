BACKGROUND
evidence from studies on dorsal root ganglion  neurons and retinal ganglion cells  suggests that the induction of an inflammatory response around the cell bodies of axotomised neurons enhances the regeneration of their axons. injection of corynebacterium into drg prior to dorsal root injury produces a fourfold increase in the number of regenerating axons  <cit> . similarly, injection of zymosan into the vitreous body of the eye induces extensive but transient regeneration of rgc axons in the crushed optic nerve  <cit> . lens injury has similar effects on rgc axonal regeneration, probably because it stimulates the accumulation of macrophages in the retina  <cit> . furthermore, adult rgcs grown in media conditioned by activated macrophages also display enhanced neurite growth  <cit> .

against this background we have investigated the possibility that lps-induced inflammation around the cell bodies of corticospinal tract neurons would enhance their expression of growth-associated genes  and promote regeneration of their axons following spinal cord injury. it is of particular importance and interest to investigate these questions in relation to corticospinal neurons because their axons constitute the major descending motor pathway, and because they display very poor regenerative responses to injury. thus corticospinal neurons do not regenerate axons to any significant extent along peripheral nerve grafts inserted into the spinal cord or brainstem  <cit>  and display upregulation of growth-associated genes only after intracortical lesion of their axons and not after spinal injury  <cit> .

RESULTS
assessing lps-induced inflammation in cortex
coronal sections through the motor cortex to which lps had been applied were immunostained with ox <dig>  an antibody that recognizes the type  <dig> complement receptor  in mononuclear phagocytes, which is upregulated by activated microglia and macrophages  <cit> . in unoperated brains and on the side opposite to lps application, and in sham-operated animals , highly ramified  microglia were present throughout the cortex. in brains in which the dura had been opened contralateral to the side of lps application, there was some accumulation of rounded ox42-positive cells at the pial surface in the first  <dig> days after treatment but deeper layers contained ramified microglia . in lps-treated cortex, microglial morphology was altered from the ramified form typical of the quiescent state, to a rounded amoeboid shape, with thicker proximal processes and loss of distal ramification . at  <dig> days after lps application microglia numbers in layer v were increased, with a mean of  <dig> cells per unit area ,  <dig> % of which were activated, compared to a mean of  <dig> cells in the contralateral cortex – of which only  <dig> % were activated . in the animals in which fluorogold was used to retrogradely label corticospinal tract  neurons, activated ox42-positive microglia were closely associated with the cell bodies of identified cst neurons in layer v . however, the inflammatory response to lps was variable. in most animals, microglial activation was seen in all layers of the cortex beneath the site of lps application, and extending up to  <dig> mm on either side, for up to one week after application. in a few animals microglial activation was only evident in the outer two thirds of the cortex. inflammation around layer v pyramidal neurons was always apparent beneath the site of lps application. two weeks after application, rounded, amoeboid microglia were rare and microglia with a ramified morphology predominated in both the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex . there were  <dig>  microglia per unit area in control cortex,  <dig> % of which were activated, compared to  <dig>  microglia per unit area, of which  <dig> % were activated, in lps-treated cortex. at one month, the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex appeared identical in all animals, with only ramified microglial cells apparent. thus,  <dig> μg of lps was sufficient to produce inflammation around layer v pyramidal neurons in all animals by  <dig> hours, which was maximal at  <dig> days and had subsided by two weeks after application.

note: all microglia within an area of  <dig> μm ×  <dig> μm  defined by a counting frame superimposed over a digitised image of layer v were counted and identified as either ramified  or activated. numbers represent means of  <dig> counts; % indicates relative proportions of ramified and activated microglia.

note: superscript numbers refer to duration of expression of the growth-associated gene after lps application:  <dig> for up to  <dig> weeks;  <dig> for up to  <dig> days;  <dig> for up to  <dig> days;  <dig> for up to  <dig> hours

from  <dig> days to  <dig> weeks after the application of lps, gfap-positive astrocytes in the lps-treated cortex showed hypertrophy of their processes and gfap immunofluorescence near the inflamed pial surface was more intense  than in the contralateral cortex,  or in unoperated controls. astrogliosis was less marked in deeper layers of cortex.

expression of growth-associated genes by corticospinal tract neurons
injection of ctb into the spinal cord at c <dig> invariably labelled layer v pyramidal cell bodies in the contralateral motor cortex. sections immediately adjacent to those reacted for ctb were reacted for c-jun, atf <dig> or scg <dig> . other sections were reacted for both ctb and a growth-associated protein, allowing identification of the protein and cst neurons in the same section .

control cortex
making a burr hole in the skull and opening the dura had some effect on c-jun and atf <dig> expression for up to  <dig> days. in unoperated cortex, c-jun was weakly expressed in cells in layers ii, iii and v. there was a small increase in c-jun expression by cells in layers i, ii, iii and v  directly underneath the burr hole even without lps application . in unoperated cortex there was no atf <dig> expression whereas in sham-operated controls, atf <dig> was expressed by very small numbers of layer i cells directly underneath the burr hole . these atf3-expressing cells had abnormal nuclei and were possibly apoptotic but could not be unequivocally identified. expression of scg <dig> protein and gap- <dig> mrna were not affected by opening of the dura. scg <dig> was weakly expressed, in layer v neurons only, in the cortex contralateral to lps application, and in sham-operated and unoperated animals. gap- <dig> mrna was present in neurons in all layers of the cortex, but most strongly in layers iv and v, contralateral to lps application, in sham-operated and unoperated animals, confirming our previous findings  <cit> . the presence or absence of gelfoam made no difference to the expression of growth-associated genes in the cerebral cortex.

lps-treated cortex
c-jun
from  <dig> hours to two weeks after lps application c-jun was markedly upregulated in most neurons of layers ii, iii and v of the motor cortex . retrograde labelling with ctb  and retrograde labelling combined with immunohistochemistry for c-jun  showed that cst neurons in layer v were among cells upregulating c-jun in response to lps application. by  <dig> month after application  there were no detectable differences between treated and control cortex.

atf3
by  <dig> hours after application of lps, atf <dig> was upregulated in a very few neurons, confined to the region under the burr hole, and in numerous glia in the subcortical white matter. as in the sham-operated animals, atf3-positive nuclei in layer i were often abnormally shaped. atf3-positive neurons in layers ii to vi were extremely sparse , but retained a normal morphology. atf <dig> was upregulated in layer v pyramidal neurons but only in relatively small numbers of such cells. expression of atf <dig> in subcortical white matter glia was much more extensive than the neuronal expression; atf3-positive nuclei were present up to  <dig> μm into the contralateral hemisphere and for  <dig> mm lateral to the area of lps application . at  <dig> days, neurons expressing atf <dig> were almost entirely confined to layers i and ii under the burr hole and to glia in subcortical white matter . this upregulation was variable and appeared to correlate with the level of inflammation. atf <dig> expression was weaker at  <dig> days  and had disappeared by  <dig> weeks . thus, atf <dig> immunoreactivity was seen in only a few layer v pyramidal neurons in animals with a maximal  inflammatory response and only at  <dig> hours after application.

scg10
scg <dig> was weakly upregulated by layer v pyramidal neurons and by no other cells. this effect was seen from  <dig> hours to  <dig> weeks after lps application . the cell bodies displaying upregulation of scg <dig> were identified as cst neurons .

gap- <dig> mrna
gap- <dig> mrna was upregulated in neurons in layers ii – vi of lps-treated cortex,  <dig> days after application , most conspicuously in layer v. after  <dig> days ,  <dig> weeks  or  <dig> month  gap- <dig> expression resembled that in unoperated cortex.

effect of cst injury in cervical spinal cord
transection of the cst at c <dig> contralateral to lps application had no detectable effect on the expression of c-jun, atf <dig> or scg- <dig> . because of these negative findings we did not investigate possible effects of combining lps treatment with c <dig> cst injury in the animals used to study gap- <dig> mrna expression by in situ hybridisation.

sprouting of corticospinal tract axons at the lesion site
application of lps to motor cortex had no obvious effect on the numbers and morphology of microglia around the lesion site in the spinal cord, compared with controls . three weeks after spinal cord lesion, injured cst axons, anterogradely labelled with bda, terminated proximal to the lesion site, many with swollen axonal tips, in both lps-treated and control animals . no axons were seen to grow into or distal to the lesion cavity or to bypass the lesion site, or send branches around it. thus, application of lps to the cortex appeared to produce no enhancement of axon regeneration into or around the lesion site. there was no statistically significant difference between control and lps-treated animals in either the 'total sprouting ratios'  or the 'lesion site sprouting ratios' . these data, summarised in table  <dig>  suggest that application of lps to motor cortex has no effect on the sprouting response or regeneration of cst axons across a lesion. the application of lps to cortex did not cause a reduction of labelled cst axons in the medulla . this result demonstrates that the uptake and anterograde transport of bda by cst neurons was unaffected by lps-induced inflammation.

notes: bda-labelled axons  in  <dig> lps-treated animals and  <dig> control animals  were counted at two sites: 1) in  <dig> horizontal sections through the cervical spinal cord  <dig>  mm rostral to the lesion site, in a  <dig> μm wide counting frame ; 2) in transverse sections through the medulla . total sprouting ratio is the ratio between the number of branch points and the total number of labelled cst axons at the level of the medulla. lesion site sprouting ratio is the ratio between branch points and labelled axons at the same level ; sem = standard error of the mean

discussion
the inability of axotomised cst neurons to upregulate growth-associated gene expression is believed to be one cause of their failure to regenerate axons  <cit> . we have shown here that application of lps onto the pial surface of motor cortex produced inflammation – demonstrated by activation of microglia – in most cases throughout the entire depth of cortex and also increased expression of growth-associated genes in some cst neurons. atf <dig> expression was upregulated for  <dig> day , gap- <dig> for  <dig> days, c-jun for  <dig> weeks and scg <dig> for  <dig> weeks in neurons within the inflamed cortex. however, in animals treated with lps and having a concomitant c <dig> cst injury there was neither an obvious increase in cst axon sprouting nor any regeneration across or around the lesion site.

does inflammation around neuronal perikarya stimulate axonal regeneration?
two experimental models provide evidence that inflammation around neuronal perikarya can stimulate axonal regeneration in vivo. injection of corynebacterium extracts into the drg both enhances the ability of the central axons of drg cells to regenerate after injury  <cit>  and stimulates upregulation of gap- <dig> and c-jun in their cell bodies  <cit> , thus mimicking some of the effects of a conditioning peripheral nerve lesion. similarly, leon et al.  <cit>  have shown that zymosan, a powerful inflammatory agent, injected into the vitreous body of the eye in adult rats, produces inflammation in the retina, upregulation of gap- <dig> expression by rgcs and enhanced regeneration of rgc axons following optic nerve injury. the interpretation of these experiments has been questioned by fischer et al.  <cit>  who suggested that zymosan may injure the lens, releasing factors that stimulate axonal regeneration. however, it has been shown recently that activated macrophages secrete a protein that, in conjunction with camp, acts as a powerful promoter of neurite outgrowth  <cit> . we have shown that lps-induced inflammation also stimulates neuronal expression of growth-associated genes in the cerebral cortex. however, we did not find enhancement of cst axonal regeneration, perhaps because of an insufficiently strong inflammatory response in layer v, or possibly because of local inhibitors at the injury site.

lps-induced cerebral inflammation
lps, an endotoxin derived from the cell wall of e. coli, is a potent inflammatory agent  <cit> . it has been extensively used in previous experimental studies in the central nervous system  and other tissues  <cit> . the toll-like receptor  <dig>  acts as an lps receptor on microglia  <cit> , but is absent from cortical neurons  <cit> . although the effects of applying lps to the surface of the cerebral cortex have not been studied previously, it has been shown that injection of lps into the cortex results in recruitment of macrophages, activation of local microglia and, later, activation of astrocytes  <cit> . neutrophils however are not recruited, in contrast to what occurs after lps injection into peripheral tissues  <cit> , which may explain the absence of overt damage to the brain. lps applied to the cortical surface in this study markedly increased the number of rounded ox42-positive cells at the surface of the brain and in the meninges , and activated microglia, increasing their number throughout the motor cortex . in most animals, there was a clear gradient of activation from superficial to deep, suggesting that lps activated microglia in a concentration-dependent manner. lps can also attract circulating monocytes into the brain but it is not clear to what extent circulating monocytes entered the cortex in our experiments, as there are no reliable cell markers that distinguish macrophages from microglia. furthermore, the astrogliosis shown by gfap immunofluorescence in the cortex to which lps was applied confirms the inflammatory effect of the lps.

zymosan has been used to produce inflammation in the retina and promote regeneration in crushed optic nerve. it may be significant that lps injection into the vitreous body was not a sufficient stimulus to induce regeneration of optic axons  <cit> . however, the eyeball is a highly 'immune-privileged' site, and more resistant to inflammation than cerebral cortex. zymosan particle injection into cortex caused substantial cavity formation and a glial scar  <cit> , whereas single injections of lps into cortex caused minimal cavitation  <cit> . chronic infusion of lps into hippocampus produced a focal necrotic lesion at the infusion site, with a surrounding region showing activation of astrocytes and macrophages  <cit> . our aim was to cause no damage to the cst cell bodies or their axons within the cortex; we therefore applied lps to the surface of the cortex. there was no sign of necrosis and it is extremely unlikely that lps applied to the pial surface would have caused axonal injury to cst neurons. if lps application had resulted in axonal injury, there would have been reductions in the numbers of bda-labelled axons in the medulla. the counts of labelled cst axons in lps-treated versus control animals  show that direct axonal injury did not occur. furthermore, cst neurons showing upregulation of scg <dig> and c-jun were retrogradely labelled from the spinal cord after lps application, demonstrating that their axons were intact .

role of perineuronal macrophages and microglia in axonal regeneration
macrophages enter drgs after a peripheral conditioning lesion and may play a role in the survival or regeneration of axotomised neurons  <cit> . microglial activation also occurs in the cns around facial, hypoglossal and spinal motor neurons after axotomy  <cit> , probably because of the release of macrophage-colony stimulating factor by the injured neurons  <cit> . in contrast to regenerating facial nucleus neurons, non-regenerating intrinsic cns neurons do not attract activated microglia after axotomy  <cit> . however, most evidence suggests that the accumulation of microglia around axotomised neurons is unnecessary for axonal regeneration  <cit>  and it has been suggested that the main role of microglia around axotomised neurons is in immune surveillance  <cit> . nonetheless, even if perineuronal macrophages or microglia are not essential for the regeneration of motor axons, the data from optic nerve regeneration experiments suggests that they may be capable of enhancing the cell body response and thus of promoting regeneration in less regeneration-competent neurons.

growth-associated genes, axonal regeneration and perineuronal inflammation
the transcription factor c-jun has been implicated in both neuronal cell death and survival after injury  <cit>  and is consistently upregulated after axotomy in regenerating neurons  <cit> . recently it has been shown that in mice lacking neuronal c-jun, both cell death and axonal regeneration after axotomy are reduced  <cit> . atf <dig> is also a transcription factor that is induced in many cell types by a range of stresses  <cit> . atf <dig> has been shown to prevent cell death and to be a neurite growth-promoting factor for cultured neurons, apparently acting through hsp <dig>  <cit> . co-localisation studies indicate that atf <dig> and c-jun mrna are co-expressed in several types of neuron after injury. transfecting atf <dig> alone into two neuron-like cell lines did not cause neurite outgrowth; c-jun expression alone caused some outgrowth, but co-expression of both atf <dig> and c-jun greatly increased neurite outgrowth  <cit> .

it has been hypothesised that gap- <dig> and scg <dig> are important for axonal elongation, through their role in cytoskeletal dynamics  <cit> . motor and drg neurons upregulate these molecules soon after axotomy. expression decreases markedly following target reinnervation, but remains high if reinnervation is prevented, suggesting that contact with target tissues regulates expression of these molecules.

the effects of atf <dig>  gap- <dig> and scg <dig> individually on axonal regeneration in vivo are difficult to assess. no axonal regeneration experiments have been reported on atf <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . gap- <dig> deficient mice show neuroanatomical abnormalities but their cns appear to be grossly normal and with normal axon growth rates  <cit> ; hence gap- <dig> is unlikely to be essential for axonal growth but probably is required for successful axonal pathfinding. transgenic overexpression of individual growth-associated molecules has induced some sprouting  <cit> , but has not turned non-regenerating neurons into regeneration-competent cells, even into favourable environments such as implanted segments of peripheral nerve or schwann cells  <cit> . however, overexpression of gap- <dig> and cap <dig> together, greatly enhanced the ability of ascending dorsal column axons to regenerate into peripheral nerve grafts placed in the spinal cord without a conditioning peripheral lesion  <cit> . no scg <dig> knockout animals have been described.

the molecules we have studied are only examples of a large range of neuronal molecules that may be required for regeneration of axons. tetzlaff et al.  <cit>  showed that although cut rubrospinal axons do not regenerate; the injury results in prolonged increased levels of gap- <dig> in their cell bodies, from which they concluded that it is their failure to maintain tubulin and actin synthesis that prevents regeneration. since individual growth-associated genes are unlikely to greatly stimulate axonal regeneration, finding a mechanism whereby a whole cascade of such molecules could be upregulated may be necessary to bring about axonal regeneration in otherwise refractory cns neurons. it seems clear that further studies are needed into the mechanisms of upregulating transcription factors that control growth associated proteins.

we have not included in this report the results of studies on the effects of applying zymosan to the pial surface of the motor cortex because we found that half of the animals thus treated developed cortical damage, often severe, in layers i to iv, that made it impossible to distinguish the effect of inflammation from other destructive processes . interestingly, the cst neurons in these zymosan-treated rats displayed expression patterns of growth-associated proteins that were almost identical to those seen in lps-treated rats at corresponding time points. as zymosan is more potent an inflammmogen than lps, it is possible that lps stimulated a maximal expression of growth-associated proteins in cst cell bodies without causing overt damage. furthermore, the estimated number of cells that upregulated c-jun, scg <dig> and gap- <dig> after lps application was far greater than the number of bda-labelled fibres in our spinal cord injury experiments, suggesting that the cell bodies of these labelled axons had probably upregulated growth-associated genes.

an intracortical injection of a solution of lps might induce a stronger inflammation closer to the cell bodies of cst neurons, but such an approach is problematic because direct tissue damage may elicit responses which mask/confound those due to the induction of an inflammatory response by cortical application of lps. we carried out experiments in which small amounts of lps were injected into deep cortex. such injections resulted in neither a detectably greater inflammatory response nor greater upregulation of growth-associated proteins in layer v . it remains to be seen whether other approaches to inducing cortical inflammation would promote a stronger and longer-lasting expression of growth-associated proteins, with the effect of stimulating cst axon regeneration.

it is possible that cst axotomy interrupts target derived regeneration-suppressing signals, and this may potentiate the effects of lps in promoting growth-associated gene expression. however, our results showed no difference in growth associated protein expression between axotomised and intact cst neurons. previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated that cervical axotomy is insufficient to induce upregulation of growth associated genes, although axotomy within the cortex  does so  <cit> . however, promoting enhanced cell body responses by proximal axotomy is unlikely to be of practical value because of the very large distance over which the cst axons would have to regrow to effect functional reconnection.

it is noteworthy that the inflammatory response induced by lps resulted in more extensive upregulation of atf <dig> in glia than in neurons. it is interesting to compare this finding with observations on atf <dig> expression in glial cells during wallerian degeneration. following dorsal root injury, atf <dig> is strongly upregulated in schwann cells around degenerating axons in the dorsal root, but not in the cns glial cells around the degenerating axons in the dorsal column  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we carried out these experiments to test the hypothesis that inflammation would induce the expression of growth-associated genes in the cell bodies of cst neurons and would consequently increase the regenerative response after cst injury. we found that application of lps to the motor cortex induced upregulation of c-jun, atf <dig>  scg <dig> and gap- <dig> in some neurons. however, the response was generally greatest in superficial layers, as was the degree of inflammation. nonetheless, we have demonstrated that perineuronal inflammation produced by a single application of lps can cause cst neurons to upregulate a range of growth-associated proteins, although the number of cells which responded in this way was limited and the effects most obvious in the first few days after application. axonal regeneration was not enhanced. the failure of cst neurons to show enhanced axon regeneration may be due to the inflammatory stimulus not being strong enough or not lasting long enough. there was variation between animals in the extent of inflammation/microglial activation produced by the standard dose  of lps applied to the cortical surface, and inflammation was always less marked in layer v than near the surface of the cortex. the absence of a widespread upregulation of atf <dig> in cst neurons may have been the result of insufficient inflammation in layer v, which may have limited the expression of the full repertoire of downstream genes necessary for regeneration. sustained, or increased inflammation deeper in the cortex may be necessary to induce a sufficiently strong and prolonged upregulation of growth-associated genes that would lead to a vigorous regenerative response to injury by cst neurons.
