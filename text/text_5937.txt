BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells  are characterized by unlimited proliferation capacity and multipotency and are one of the most promising stem cell populations for use in cardiovascular regenerative medicine. however, the use of escs is hampered by their embryonic origin and by the potential immune rejection of allogeneic cell grafts. these issues may potentially be circumvented by the use of induced pluripotent stem cells  that are reprogrammed from somatic cells by the ectopic expression of  <dig> transcription factors   <cit> . the use of ipscs allows the generation of patient-specific cells of any lineage that is not derived from embryos. ipscs have a differentiation capacity similar to that of escs and were shown to be capable of differentiating into functional cardiomyocytes through embryoid body  formation  <cit> . eb formation has been utilized widely as a trigger of in vitro differentiation in escs and ipscs and is a critical intermediate step in the induction of lineage-specific differentiation  <cit> . the importance of eb formation is further demonstrated by findings that lineage-specific differentiation programs within ebs closely resemble lineage commitment programs in the developing embryo  <cit> .

lineage-specific differentiation within ebs is a response to a variety of environmental stimuli, including cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix interactions. recent strategies for engineering eb formation have focused primarily on controlling eb size, extracellular matrix  interactions and cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . processes that determine cell fate are often mediated by the ecm, and such mediation has been studied largely by seeding escs or ebs within natural ecm hydrogel materials  <cit> . native ecm components such as collagen, fibronectin and laminin direct cell differentiation through integrin-mediated signaling events  <cit>  and through intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately lead to gene expression changes that modulate cell phenotype  <cit> . ecm/integrin interactions have been shown to influence stem cell differentiation, attachment and proliferation during early embryonic development  <cit> . however, little is known regarding the role of ecm/integrin interactions in the growth and cardiac lineage commitment of ipsc-derived ebs that closely resemble corresponding processes in the developing embryo. the objective of the present study was to explore the role of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction in eb formation from mipscs and the involvement of such interaction in the differentiation of mipscs into cardiomyocytes.

RESULTS
collagen and β <dig> integrin are expressed synergistically during eb formation
the morphology of the undifferentiated mipsc colonies carrying the gfp transgene targeted to the oct <dig> locus closely resembled that of the mescs growing on either mefs or gelatin-coated dishes under feeder-free conditions and expressing green fluorescent protein  . to induce cardiac differentiation, the mipscs and mescs were cultured via the hanging drop method or static suspension to form three-dimensional embryoid bodies  . through both of these culture systems, ebs resembling those derived from mescs were generated from the mipscs on day  <dig> and  <dig> of differentiation .

.

to explore the role of collagen/integrin interactions in eb formation, the expression of collagen and of its integrin receptors  was determined by semiquantitative rt-pcr in undifferentiated mescs, mipscs, and ebs. undifferentiated mescs and mipscs expressed itga <dig> and itgb <dig> , whereas col1a <dig>  col1a <dig>  col3a <dig> and itga <dig> were not expressed . during eb formation, the expression of col1a <dig> and itgb <dig> was upregulated and peaked on day  <dig> of differentiation, then fell to levels equal to those in mescs and mipscs on day  <dig> . real-time pcr results confirmed that col1a <dig> and itgb <dig> were expressed in a temporal pattern with a peak on day  <dig> during eb formation . the expression of itga <dig>  was not upregulated but reduced on day  <dig> during eb formation . immunostaining of ebs on day  <dig> demonstrated the expression of collagen type i . these findings suggest that collagen type i and β <dig> integrin were expressed temporarily and synergistically during eb formation in mescs and mipscs.


β <dig> integrin blocking inhibits the growth and shell formation of mipsc-derived ebs
because ecm/integrin interactions have been shown to influence stem cell differentiation during early embryonic development  <cit> , we hypothesized that collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction may play a similar role in eb formation, which closely resembles embryonic development. to test this hypothesis, we administered  <dig> μm vc,  <dig> μm cis and  <dig> ng/ml β <dig> integrin blocking antibody to respectively promote collagen synthesis, inhibit collagen synthesis, and block collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction prior to eb formation . size analysis showed that the mean diameter of the ebs produced in static suspension culture was larger in the vc group and smaller in the cis and β <dig> integrin blocking groups compared with the control group . on day  <dig> of differentiation, the mean diameter of ebs was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the vc group,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the cis group, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the control group. β <dig> integrin blocking led to a marked decrease in eb size to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . the mean diameter of ebs produced via the hanging drop method was not significantly altered by β <dig> integrin blocking . phase-contract and fluorescent micrographs of mipsc-derived ebs formed after β <dig> integrin blocking revealed a loose outer layer lacking a dense shell as observed in control ebs . scanning electron micrographs revealed the formation of a smooth outer layer resulting from extracellular matrix deposition in control ebs , in contrast to a cilium-like surface topography lacking a dense shell-like layer in ebs formed after β <dig> integrin blocking .


decreased cardiac differentiation of mipsc-derived ebs after β <dig> integrin blocking
to assess whether blocking of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction during eb formation affects the cardiac lineage commitment of mipscs, mipsc-derived ebs formed with or without β <dig> integrin blocking were differentiated using a standard protocol . from day  <dig> to day  <dig> of differentiation, plated ebs were examined for spontaneous beating activity. during the time course of cardiac differentiation, the percentage of beating ebs in the β <dig> integrin blocking group was lower than that in the control group . the percentage of beating ebs continued to increase until day  <dig> of differentiation and reached plateau values of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the β <dig> integrin blocking group and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the control group. on day  <dig>  the beating ebs were immunostained for cardiac troponin t  to characterize the cardiac-specific protein. this immunostaining revealed organized sarcomeric myofilaments in the control group in contrast to less ctnt staining and unorganized myofilaments in the β <dig> integrin blocking group .


to characterize the cardiomyocyte phenotype, we included a series of marker genes in the study. gata-binding protein  <dig> , nk <dig> transcription factor related locus  <dig> , and myocyte enhancer factor 2c  were included as markers for cardiac mesoderm. α-myosin heavy chain  and myosin light chain  <dig> atrial and ventricular transcripts  were included as markers for cardiomyocytes. the semiquantitative rt-pcr and real-time pcr results both demonstrated that all of the above cardiac-specific markers were decreased significantly in the mipsc-derived ebs formed after β <dig> integrin blocking . these findings indicate that blocking of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction during eb formation leads to decreased cardiac differentiation of mipscs.

discussion
eb formation, which recapitulates various aspects of early embryonic development and displays a high degree of self-organization  <cit> , has been commonly used to induce lineage-specific differentiation of escs and ipscs. the typical characteristics of eb formation, such as eb size and shape, are important parameters that influence cardiac lineage commitment  <cit> . collagen, the major component of ecm, has been shown to enhance cardiac cell engraftment  <cit>  and cardiac differentiation  <cit>  through integrin-mediated interactions between the cells and collagen. there is increasing evidence that ecm/integrin interactions are essential for stem cell differentiation, attachment and proliferation during early embryonic development  <cit> . we hypothesized that collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction plays an essential role in the formation and cardiac differentiation of ipsc-derived ebs, which closely resembles early embryonic development. to test this hypothesis, we examined the expression patterns of collagen and integrins during eb formation. our findings, consistent with those of a previous study  <cit> , showed that undifferentiated mescs and mipscs expressed integrin α <dig> and β <dig> but not integrin α <dig>  during eb formation, collagen and β <dig> integrin were upregulated synergistically and peaked on day  <dig> of differentiation, suggesting that the collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction may be involved in eb formation.

we used two common culture techniques, the hanging drop method and static suspension. static suspension culture is performed by adding a suspension of escs or ipscs to a bacteriological petri dish and allowing the cells to aggregate spontaneously via cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . this method was used to assess the effect of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction on the growth of mipsc-derived ebs. the size and shape of the ebs resulting from static suspension culture tend to be heterogeneous  <cit> , and this phenomenon has been shown to influence cardiac lineage-specific differentiation  <cit> . such heterogeneity is avoided by the hanging drop method, in which a defined number of isolated mescs or mipscs are added to a drop where they aggregate  <cit> . to exclude the confounding effect of size heterogeneity on cardiac differentiation, we used the hanging drop method to investigate the effect of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction on the cardiac differentiation of mipscs.

the size analysis of ebs formed by static suspension culture showed that eb size was increased by treatment with ascorbic acid  but decreased by treatment with cis , indicating that collagen synthesis is potent regulator of eb growth. treatment with β <dig> integrin blocking antibody produced a greater decrease in eb size, indicating the essential role of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction in the control of eb size. the size of ebs formed by the hanging drop method was not affected by treatment with β <dig> integrin blocking antibody. however, the ebs formed by this method following β <dig> integrin blocking did not form a dense shell-like layer as is observed in normal ebs  <cit> . during eb formation, a layer of primitive endoderm is often formed on the exterior surface following cell aggregation  <cit> . consistent with our observation that ebs failed to form a dense shell-like layer following β <dig> integrin blocking, another recent study demonstrated that β <dig> integrin blocking in differentiating ebs resulted in the detachment of this endoderm layer from the eb surface  <cit> .

because eb size and shape have been shown to play essential roles in cardiac lineage commitment  <cit> , we investigated whether β <dig> integrin blocking during eb formation affects the cardiac lineage commitment of mipscs. a study of spontaneous beating activity, the quantification of cardiac-specific gene expression and ctnt immunostaining all revealed decreased cardiac differentiation in mipsc-derived ebs formed after the blocking of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction. in addition, we also assessed some markers related to the structural/maturity characteristics of cardiomyocytes, such as ctni, mlc2a, and mlc2v. ctnt staining showed that ipscs-derived cardiomyocytes failed to form organized sarcomeric myofilaments with β <dig> integrin blocking as that in the control group , and measurement of mlc2a and mlc2c revealed decreased expression after integrin β <dig> disruption . moreover, organized myofilaments and high mlc2v expression are also considered as markers for mature cardiomyocytes  <cit> . these results suggested that the structure and maturity of ipscs-derived cardiomyocytes were impaired by integrin β <dig> blocking. in conclusion, our findings indicate that collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction is required for the growth and cardiac differentiation of mipsc-derived ebs. this information will be helpful in future engineering of the eb microenvironment to promote the cardiac differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.

in the developing embryo, the native ecm plays a central role by mediating biophysical stimuli, biochemical and molecular signals and spatial organization. the process of constant interchange between cells and the ecm, termed dynamic reciprocity, determines cell fate and triggers the shift from proliferation to structure formation  <cit> . as main components of native ecm, collagen may be involved in the development of many organs through integrin-mediated signaling events. our results revealed that integrin β <dig> disruption resulted in decreased cardiomyocytes differentiation, but whether other cell lineages will be affected by integrin β <dig> disruption remained to be further investigated . moreover, the potential mechanism remained unclear, although we excluded the possibility that the loss of pluripotency is not affected by integrin β <dig> blocking . these effects of integrin disruption may relate to the loosely formed ebs which lack some structure that are essential for cardiogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study demonstrated that blockage of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction inhibited the quality and growth of mipsc-derived ebs, resulting in reduced eb size and decreased cardiac differentiation potential. these findings indicated the essential role of collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction in cardiac lineage commitment of mipscs during eb formation, and will shed light on engineering matrix microenvironment within ebs to efficiently direct the cardiac fate of pluripotent stem cells.
