BACKGROUND
cochliobolus heterostrophus  is the causative agent of southern corn leaf blight   <cit> , a common disease of maize in tropical and subtropical regions . cochliobolus species belong to the class dothideomycetes, order pleosporales, which includes a large number of highly destructive plant pathogens  <cit> . c. heterostrophus is a necrotrophic fungus. there are two known races: race t, which produces a host selective toxin called t-toxin, and race o, which does not. in  <dig>  an sclb epidemic caused by race t led to large economic losses in the eastern and southern united states. currently, the disease is effectively controlled by planting resistant hybrids  <cit> , but the pathogen remains an important subject of investigation as a model for mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence as well as the evolutionary processes generating highly virulent strains. the ease with which the sexual cycle of c. heterostrophus can be induced in the laboratory and the development of efficient homologous integration techniques facilitate site-specific mutagenesis and make c. heterostrophus an excellent genetic model  <cit> .

race t is particularly virulent to plants that carry the texas cytoplasmic male sterile trait  as these plants are sensitive to t-toxin  <cit> . the ability to produce t-toxin is related to the presence of ~  <dig> -mb of dna encoding genes related to the production of t-toxin  <cit> . kodama et al.  <cit>  detected two loci  related to the production of t-toxin. they found that these loci are associated with a translocation involving race o chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  to date, nine genes responsible for the elevated virulence of race t have been identified. at the tox1a locus, two genes  encode the polyketide synthases, pks1
 <cit>  and pks2
 <cit> , one gene each encodes lam <dig>  a putative 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase  <cit> , oxi <dig>  a putative short-chain dehydrogenase  <cit> , and tox9
 <cit>  that has no predicted functional domains or homology to known genes. the tox1b locus encodes the genes dec <dig>  a decarboxylase  <cit>  and three reductases red1
 <cit> , red  <dig>  and red3
 <cit> . none of these genes is found in race o. the production of t-toxin is complex, and the evolutionary origin of the associated genes is unclear. additionally, the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of race t is not known  <cit> . however, a large number of repeated sequences were found to flank tox1
 <cit>  and a large proportion of repetitive tracts in the sequenced genomes share similarity with sequences for transposable elements . in fact, tes have been associated with regions of virulence in various fungi including magnaporthe grisea
 <cit> , fusarium oxysporum
 <cit>  and c. heterostrophus race t itself  <cit> .

transposable elements can be classified in a hierarchical manner into: class, subclass, order, superfamily, family, and subfamily. there are two main classes of elements, distinguished by the presence or absence of an rna intermediate. the elements of class i, retrotransposons, replicate through a “copy-and-paste” mechanism that generates rna intermediates that are subsequently reverse transcribed into double-stranded dna by enzymes encoded by te dna  <cit> . each complete transposition cycle produces a new copy of the te. consequently, retrotransposons are frequently the major contributors to repetitive tracts in the genome. retrotransposons can be divided into five orders based in the transposition mechanism, organization and phylogeny of the reverse transcriptase: ltr  retrotransposons, dirs-like , penelope-like, lines , and sines   <cit> .

ltr- and line-type retrotransposons are widely distributed in the genomes of fungi  <cit> . the ltr superfamilies most commonly present in these genomes are gypsy and copia, which encode two regions known as gag and pol. the gag region encodes structural proteins that form a virus-like particle . the pol region encodes a protease, a reverse transcriptase , a rnase and an integrase  <cit> . the gypsy and copia superfamilies differ in the order of genes encoding the rt and the integrase in the pol region  <cit> . lines lack long terminal repeat sequences, can vary in size, and have been separated into five superfamilies: r <dig>  l <dig>  rte, i, and jockey. each superfamily is then divided into multiple families. autonomous lines encode at least one rt and one nuclease in their pol orf . an orf similar to the gag region is sometimes found in a position upstream of the pol region, but its role remains unclear. at the 3’ end of the lines, a poly tail, tandem repeats or an a-rich region may be present  <cit> . the number of copies of non-ltrs varies enormously between the different sequenced fungal genomes  <cit> .

class ii elements, the dna transposons, are divided into two subclasses. subclass i comprises elements that transpose by a mechanism of excision and integration, with both strands of dna being cleaved during the excision process, while subclass  <dig> is composed of elements that duplicate themselves prior to insertion. furthermore, subclass  <dig> comprises two orders, the most well-known being the tir . this order has nine superfamilies: tc1-mariner, mutator, hat, merlin, transib, p, pif/harbinger, cacta and crypton. subclass  <dig> comprises also two orders: helitron and maverick
 <cit> . there are also non-autonomous groups of tes that lack one or more genes essential for transposition, including mites  in class ii, sines in the non-ltr retrotransposons and trims  and lards  in the ltr retrotransposons  <cit> .

transposable elements are important in the generation of variability, structure and evolution of genomes  <cit> . some of the effects of tes may be due to ectopic recombination among tes of the same family. ectopic recombination occurs between homologous dna sequences on different chromosomes  and can have beneficial as well as potentially deleterious consequences for the eukaryotic genome. in general, however, the introgression of tes into a genome is potentially harmful, as the activity of transposons and rearrangement sites can lead to a decrease in genome stability. as a result, many organisms have defense systems that repress the activity of tes. one defense mechanism that has received particular attention is the repeat-induced point mutation  system. rip is a gene silencing mechanisms that leads to the mutation of repetitive dna sequences during the sexual cycle, between fertilization and nuclear fusion. in general, rip induces gc-to-at mutations in duplicated dna sequences of more than  <dig> base pairs  with sequence identity greater than 80%  <cit> . cytosine methylation is frequently associated with rip-type mutations, and in neurospora crassa, the methyltransferase  is responsible for that methylation  <cit> . evidence of rip has been detected also in c. heterostrophus
 <cit> .

ohm et al.  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> members of the class dothideomycetes and found that genes encoding effector proteins frequently occur near tes. the authors also showed that the action of the rip silencing mechanism in sequences near tes can expose those sequences to a high rate of point mutations. this phenomenon perhaps facilitates the response of the fungus to adverse environmental conditions and provides an advantage against its host. with the advent of genome sequencing, the analysis of tes in genomes has become possible, particularly in model fungi such as c. heterostrophus. therefore, due to the important role that transposons play in the evolutionary processes of this fungus, a broad search for and complete characterization of the major tes distributed in the genome of c. heterostrophus was conducted. the results found in this study improve the understanding of the potential impact of tes on the evolution of c. heterostrophus.

RESULTS
analysis of transposable elements in the genome of c. heterostrophus
a combination of bioinformatic predictions and manual inspections revealed that  <dig> % of the sequenced c. heterostrophus race o genome, estimated to be 36 mb, consists of tes, of which 61% correspond to complete sequences while the remaining 39% were considered to be degenerate sequences . identified class i elements included ltr retrotransposons belonging to the superfamilies copia and gypsy . a high number of non-ltr retrotransposons belonging to the order line, superfamily i and superfamily r <dig> were also identified . nine non-autonomous elements, annotated as trims, and  <dig> solo-ltrs were also identified. with regard to class ii, only elements pertaining to the order tir, superfamily tc1-mariner, were identified  . in total,  <dig> complete element sequences were identified, of which  <dig> te sequences exhibited orfs for major protein domains. these tes were therefore identified “in silico” as being potentially active. of these potentially active tes, four elements belonged to the copia, four to the r <dig>  eight to the tc1-mariner,  <dig> to the gypsy and  <dig> to the i superfamilies . the remaining sequences with identity to tes were found to be incomplete: they lacked some characteristic structure of the superfamily or no conserved domain was shown and were therefore classified as degenerate sequences .table  <dig>

ltr retrotransposons of the superfamily copia
ten complete copies of copia superfamily tes were identified, four of which were potentially active. two families were identified based on ltr alignments. analysis of the ltr alignments for these two families against the repbase database of fungal tes did not generate any significant results , demonstrating the existence of two new families of copia elements that are herein termed copia-1_ch and copia-2_ch. major protein regions with similarity to copia-like elements were found in all of the elements, and are, from 5’ to 3’: a gag polypeptide, an integrase domain, a reverse transcriptase domain and an rnase h domain . the family copia-1_ch is composed of nine elements with sizes varying from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb and flanked by 443 bp ltrs. three of these elements are potentially active and include a single orf comprising the gag and pol regions that encodes a  <dig>  residue polyprotein. the family copia-2_ch is represented by a single potentially active element. this element is  <dig>  bp and is flanked by  <dig>  bp ltrs. additionally, this element has a single orf comprising the pol and gag protein domains that encode a  <dig>  residue protein. in contrast to the family copia-1_ch, this element recognizes 6 bp insertion site, while the other elements recognize 5 bp sites. the ltrs from all of the elements typically begin with 5’-tg-3’ and end with 5’-ca-3’. seven trim elements and three solo-ltrs related to elements belonging to the family copia-1_ch were also identified.

ltr retrotransposons from the superfamily gypsy
a total of  <dig> complete copies of gypsy superfamily tes were identified,  <dig> of which were potentially active. the sizes of the elements varied from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. eight te families belonging to the gypsy superfamily were identified through the alignment of ltrs . blastn analysis of ltrs against the nucleotide repbase fungal te database did not generate any significant results, suggesting that these sequences likely represent eight new te families, here named gypsy-1_ch, gypsy-2_ch, gypsy-3_ch, gypsy-4_ch, gypsy-5_ch, gypsy-6_ch, gypsy-7_ch, and gypsy-8_ch. each of the potentially active elements has two orfs related to the gag and pol regions that vary in size even within the same family . within a given element, the pol orf was encoded by a different reading frame than the gag orf. the pol region is composed of the aspartic protease , reverse transcriptase , rnaseh, chromodomain and integrase domains in an organization typical of ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons . the family gypsy-2_ch is most frequently represented, with  <dig> complete elements present in the genome. unlike the other families, gypsy-1_ch is composed only of potentially active elements, and the gag and pol orfs are superimposed, with the first orf in a + <dig> reading frame and the second in a + <dig> reading frame. similar to copia elements, gypsy elements have ltrs that typically begin with 5’-tg-3’ and end with 5’-ca-3’. finally, two trim elements and  <dig> solo-ltrs related to the superfamily gypsy were also identified.table  <dig>

non-ltr retrotransposons
a total of  <dig> copies of elements belonging to superfamily i were identified,  <dig> of which were considered to be potentially active. these elements varied in size from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. the alignment of orf <dig> between elements identified in the c. heterostrophus genome revealed the existence of two groups with identity greater than 80% in at least 80% of the aligned sequences. blastn and blastp analyses against the repbase fungi database did not identify similarity greater than 80% with any known sequence, suggesting that these groups represent two new families of non-ltr elements, here termed i-1_ch and i-2_ch. all the identified elements exhibit two orfs. orf <dig> is similar to the gag region, but its role remains unclear. orf <dig> contains an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease  domain, a reverse transcriptase  domain and an rnaseh  domain . in the order line, this last domain is only present in members of the superfamily i. all of the identified elements exhibited tandem repeats of an aat sequence, with the number of repeats varying between members of the same family . analysis of orf <dig> sequences in i-1_ch revealed different sized orfs across the family . six elements belonging to the superfamily r <dig> were identified, with three being potentially active and having sizes of  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb. the first two elements encode a single  <dig> residue orf, while the third encodes a single  <dig> residue orf. the orfs identified for the elements of the superfamily r <dig> displayed reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains.table  <dig>

transposable elements of the superfamily tc1-mariner
twenty-nine complete copies of elements related to the superfamily tc1-mariner were identified, of which only eight were considered to be potentially active. we decided not to classify these elements according to family because we found a low number of potentially active copies and a high degree of divergence in the structural characteristics of the elements. the size of the complete copies varied between  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb. these elements have tirs varying from 27 bp to 70 bp flanked by a tsd . the elements also have dde domains characteristic of transposases. the potentially active copies have a single orf comprising the intact dde domain, which varied from  <dig> residues to  <dig> residues. seven mites elements were also identified. however, repeatmasker can fail to detect mites copies because these sequences are small and lack genes optimizing the identification.

tes near genes
the analysis of approximately  <dig>  bp of sequence up and down stream of complete tes identified  <dig> protein-coding sequences or protein domains near tes. several of these genes encode proteins related to the transport of lipids, sugars, nitrogenous bases, and amino acids. transposons were also found near genes related to the transport of drugs such as the multidrug transporter mfs  transporters, efflux transporter fnx <dig> and abc  drug transporter. other genes associated with important metabolic pathways such as: glycosyl hydrolase, glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase, asparagine synthetase, chitin synthase, ph-response regulator protein palc, tyrosyl-trna synthetase, succinyl-coa ligase and benomyl/methotrexate resistance protein, among others had tes nearby .

unfortunately, due to the different technologies used to sequence race o strain c <dig>  and race t strain c <dig> , it was not possible to do a genome-wide comparative analysis of tes between the two races. the repetitive content returned for genomes sequenced by illumina tends to underestimate the abundance of repetitive elements because small and repetitive reads are difficult to assemble within long repeat regions using this technology. thus, the elements identified in race o were not found or were found as small fragments at the ends of the race t scaffolds. however, c. heterostrophus race t strain c <dig> was first sequenced by the turgeon/yoder program at the torrey mesa research institute  in  <dig>  2× paired-end shotgun sequence coverage was combined with 3× celera paired end coverage assembled into  <dig> scaffolds of ~35 mb. some tox <dig> scaffolds  were subsequently connected by targeted sequencing. we performed a blastn search against the ncbi database  to determine the presence of race o tes near t-toxin-related virulence genes on scaffolds carrying these genes. the blastn analysis against the ncbi database revealed the presence of tes on scaffolds 4fp , 4 lu , 3pl , and oxi1/tox <dig>  .figure  <dig>

one partially sequenced retrotransposon element was found  <dig>  bp upstream of the pks <dig> gene . this element was found at the beginning of the scaffold, with a  <dig>  bp sequence available. this sequence had 81% identity to a single ltr-gypsy element identified in race o. one 276 bp ltr fragment was found 921 bp upstream from the oxi <dig> gene . that ltr fragment had greater than 80% identity to eight ltr-gypsy elements identified in race o. another 226 bp sequence related to the ltrs of copia elements was identified at the end of the same scaffold. that sequence was found  <dig>  bp downstream of the tox <dig> gene . similarly, that sequence was imperfect and had 88% identity with the sequence of a copia element identified in the race o genome. a 327 bp sequence similar to other gypsy ltrs was identified between the red <dig> and red <dig> genes , and this sequence showed an identity greater than 85% with  <dig> ltr sequences from of gypsy elements identified in race o, although it was not possible to detect the complete ltr. a  <dig>  bp fragment was identified at the end of the 4 lu scaffold  and was found 52 bp downstream from the pks <dig> gene. finally, a transposon fragment containing an intact 496 bp ltr was found 107 bp upstream from the lam <dig> gene  . blastn analysis revealed that ltrs in this transposon fragment had more than 80% identity with the  <dig> gypsy-3_ch family gypsy elements identified in the genome of c. heterostrophus race o.

evidence of rip
evidence of the action of the rip mechanism was found in elements belonging to the tc1-mariner and i superfamilies . evidence of the rip silencing mechanism was not found in copia-1_ch, gypsy-1_ch or gypsy-5_ch families . interestingly, no elements from these three families were found near genes. in contrast, sequences where rip was detected were found near coding regions at least once per element.table  <dig>

transcriptional activity of class i and class ii transposon sequences
to assess the potential transcriptional activity of the identified tes, the cluster of tes generated in support of the c. heterostrophus c <dig> race o genome annotation  <cit>  was analyzed. of the  <dig>  sequences present in the est cluster,  <dig> showed significant alignment  with sequences of class i and class ii elements. the i superfamily was the most frequently represented, with  <dig> ests identified. ten ests related to the copia superfamily,  <dig> ests related to the tc1-mariner superfamily and  <dig> ests related to the gypsy superfamily were also found.

discussion
transposable elements in the genome of c. heterostrophus
fungi are broadly used in food production, biotechnology and agriculture, in addition to being the primary organisms responsible for the decomposition and recycling of nutrients. however, these microorganisms also cause devastating diseases, primarily in plants, and as such represent an enormous problem for global food security  <cit> . with the increase in large-scale sequencing projects for fungal genomes, more detailed analyses of the genomes can be performed. these types of analyses have revealed the relevance of the activity of mobile dna and its role in important genome restructuring events at key moments in evolution  <cit> .

condon et al.  <cit>  have estimated that 9% of the sequenced genome of c. heterostrophus race o strain c <dig> is composed of repetitive sequences. in the current manuscript, using a combination of bioinformatic predictions and manual adjustments, it was estimated that approximately 6% of these repetitive sequences are tes, and  <dig> new families were found. repetitive sequences generally represent  <dig> to 20% of the sequenced genomes of fungi; in pyrenophora tritici-repentis
 <cit>  and setosphaeria turcica
 <cit>  16% and  <dig> %, respectively, of the sequenced genome correspond to repetitive sequences. however, some sequenced genomes such as that of ustilago maydis have low repetitive sequence content, with only  <dig> %  <cit> . in contrast, other fungal genomes with unusual sizes display a large number of repetitive sequences: 85% of the genome of blumeria graminis, estimated at 174 mb, is represented by repetitive sequences, the largest percentage found to this point in fungi  <cit> .

approximately 50% of the sequences of tes identified in the c. heterostrophus race o genome belong to the gypsy superfamily of retrotransposons. retrotransposons are the largest constituent of the repetitive fraction of the genome in phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> . however, the content of ltr retrotransposons in fungal genomes is highly variable and can range from complete absence, as in trichoderma atroviride, to more than  <dig> elements, as in mycosphaerella graminicola
 <cit> . copies of non-autonomous elements from ltr retrotransposons known as trims were also identified. these sequences lack one or more genes essential for transposition. however, non-autonomous elements or defective elements can be cross-activated by similar active elements belonging to different families  <cit> .

although ltr retrotransposons represent the majority of the te sequences detected in the genome of c. heterostrophus race o, the elements of superfamily i were the most abundantly represented in terms of the number of complete and potentially active copies. non-ltr retrotransposons are the major component found in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . however, specifically in fungi, in most species where non-ltr retrotransposons were identified, these are found to be degenerate and comprise no more than  <dig> % of the sequenced genome, with the number of copies varying from a single copy in botrytis cinerea to  <dig> copies in chaetomium globosum
 <cit> . a high percentage  of the c. heterostrophus genome is related to elements of superfamily i. however, the high proportion of non-ltr retrotransposons cannot be easily explained because the abundance and distribution of a particular te depends on various processes such as limitations on the number of copies imposed by natural selection, which removes deleterious insertions; horizontal and vertical transfer; passive and active inactivation of repeat sequences; and self-regulation of transposition . because the impact of these factors can vary largely, the number of tes of each species is unique and virtually impossible to predict a priori
 <cit> . with regard to line elements, elements of the superfamily r <dig> were identified that exhibited a single orf and have a site-specific distribution in the genome. these elements are considered to be more ancestral in the group of non-ltr retrotransposons .

copies of elements related to the tc1-mariner superfamily were also identified. these elements generally encode a single protein known as transposase. transposases can be divided into various families according to the transposition mechanism. the most representative family is the dd-transposase, which contains a characteristic motif of three acidic residues, two of which are aspartic acids and the last is a glutamic acid or, in some cases, a third aspartic acid  <cit> . all of the potentially active elements identified in this study have the dde motif. copies of non-autonomous elements from the tc1-mariner transposons known as mites were also identified. these sequences lack one or more genes essential for transposition. however, in various species, a small number of tc1-mariner elements can be responsible for the origin and activation of a large population of non-autonomous elements  <cit> .

elements potentially active
a total of  <dig> elements, approximately 65% of the complete tes found, are potentially active. this activity was demonstrated through alignment of the sequences of tes identified in the c. heterostrophus genome against the est cluster, with the results demonstrating the presence of transcripts related to the major superfamilies of elements identified herein. “in silico” evidence of potential activity has also been reported by martin et al.  <cit>  in laccaria bicolor. the activation of tes under stress conditions has been demonstrated in aspergillus oryzae
 <cit>  and ophiostoma ulmi
 <cit> . the effect of te insertion depends on its target locus , but, in general, the impact of alterations caused by a transposition event is low because deleterious mutations are eliminated. another source of deleterious effects as a result of tes is the potential for recombination between elements belonging to the same family. however, one potentially positive effect of the presence of these elements may be that their mutational activity, excluding deleterious insertions, promotes genetic diversity and increases the speed of the adaptation process. in addition, some transposons are linked to genes and control their expression  <cit> .

evidence of ectopic recombination
the evolution of chromosomal structure in dothideomycetes, to a first approximation, appears to be the result of chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . in this context, tes from the same family are considered to be strong sites for ectopic recombination. ectopic recombination events can influence species adaptation, as they can promote rearrangements  and chromosomal breaks  <cit> . in particular, various possible ectopic recombination events involving transposon sequences using the rdp program were detected in the genome of c. heterostrophus race o. therefore, recombination between retrotransposon sequences may have been or is a contributing factor in the reorganization of the c. heterostrophus genome. complex dna recombination events and the cultivation of monocultures of susceptible maize germplasm containing tcms are considered to be causes of the southern corn leaf blight epidemic that occurred in the 1970s with the emergence of the c. heterostrophus race t  <cit> .

the presence of non-autonomous elements and solo-ltrs corroborates the notion of the high degree of ectopic recombination between sequences of tes. these sequences generally result from recombination between sequences of tes in the genome of c. heterostrophus race o. similarly, the analysis of scaffolds carrying genes responsible for the production of t-toxin in c. heterostrophus race t revealed the presence of various solo-ltrs, suggesting a high recombination rate in this region. the tox1a and tox1b loci, related to the production of t-toxin, are associated with a translocation involving race o chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the tes were/are an important ectopic recombination sites and, therefore, can increase variability in this species. unfortunately, due to the use of illumina sequencing technology in the genome of race t, further comparisons between the two races could not be conducted, as this type of technology tends to eliminate tes during assembly of the scaffolds.

evidence of rip
the adaptability of the host may be negatively affected by tes that can cause gene deletions and duplications, chromosomal rearrangements and alterations in the expression of essential genes. however, some fungi have genetic silencing mechanisms known as rip mechanisms to control repetitive dna sequences such as the transposons. despite evidence of rip previously reported by clutterbuck  <cit>  and ohm et al.  <cit> , no evidence of the presence of the rid protein or the selectivity of the rip mechanism for euchromatic regions has been reported. in the present study, in addition to the identification of rip-like mutations in some families of tes, a rid-like protein, which is known to be an essential part of the rip machinery in n. crassa
 <cit> 
, was identified in the c. heterostrophus genome. another interesting result was that, of all the sequences analyzed, only families of transposons that contain at least one aligned copy near a coding region had riped sequences. elements belonging to the families gypsy-1_ch, gypsy-5_ch, and copia-1_ch did not show strong evidence of rip activity. no coding sequences were found near any of these transposons, indicating that these tes are most likely in heterochromatic regions. thus, rip in c. heterostrophus appears to be a highly selective mechanism, acting only on te copies inserted near coding regions. a difference in the intensity with which rip acts between the different transposable elements has been reported in other fungi; in stagnospora nodorum, the molly and elsa transposons are more clearly affected by rip  <cit> , while in aspergillus niger, rip is considered a severe event and only two sequences of anita <dig> elements, of the  <dig> analyzed, exhibit evidence of rip. interestingly, these two sequences are found inserted into orfs  <cit> . another important aspect related to the presence of the rip silencing mechanism in c. heterostrophus has been shown by ohm et al.  <cit> . the authors demonstrated that point mutations due to the presence of rip also occur in regions near tes. the co-localization of effector genes and tes, therefore, exposes those genes to high rates of point mutations. this may accelerate the rate of evolution of these genes, providing a potential advantage for the host.

all genes up to  <dig>  bp from the identified tes were mapped. in addition to the possibility of suffering rip when at a distance of less than  <dig>  bp from the tes  <cit> , these regions can also be altered in their expression as a result of the presence of tes. moreover, rearrangements caused by eventual ectopic recombination can modify gene structure, including toxin biosynthetic locus  <cit> . sequences containing genes related to mfs transporters, drug transporters, polyketide synthases and hydrolases were found near tes. in mycosphaerella fijiensis, where rip has been shown to be very severe, several mfs and abc transporters were identified near tes  <cit> . genes related to abc and mfs transporters have an important role in the transport of drugs and, therefore, provide protection for the organism against toxic products. in plant pathogens, these transporters can be associated with multidrug resistance, virulence and alteration of sensitivity to fungicides  <cit> . another group of proteins commonly found near tes were hydrolases. the two main enzymes found were glycoside hydrolases and lipases. these enzymes are known to play an important role in plant pathogenicity  <cit> . the fact that tes are also found near polyketide synthase-encoding genes, major virulence-related genes in race t, is also an indication that these sequences can suffer from the influence of tes. in cochliobolus carbonum, host-specific toxin genes are situated in transposon-rich regions of the genome  <cit> . although the genes listed here are not considered to be essential genes, they play a very important role in the responses to the environment and to the pathogen. tes have been associated with gene regulation in fungi. for example, in aspergillus nidulans there is evidence of the involvement of transposons in the regulation of gene clusters related to secondary metabolism  <cit> . in pyrenophora tritici-repentis, another member of the order pleosporales, the analysis of tes has suggested the involvement of tes in the creation of new genes, diversification, horizontal gene transfer and trans-duplication  <cit> . additionally, comparative analysis between genomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic p. tritici-repentis isolates showed that pathogenicity in this species emerged through an influx of tes, which created a genetically flexible situation that enabled an easy response to environmental changes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a complete characterization of the major tes present in the genome of c. heterostrophus race o was performed. twelve new families of transposons were identified, demonstrating the possible role of these elements in the genomic regulation and evolution of c. heterostrophus. in c. heterostrophus, the rip silencing mechanism is efficient and selective, allowing movement of elements in heterochromatic regions, but silencing copies that may be inserted into coding regions. the major coding regions influenced by rip mechanism were also characterized. additionally, it was shown that ectopic recombination promoted by tes appears to be the major event in the genome reorganization of this species and that a large number of elements are still potentially active.
