BACKGROUND
the filamentous fungus penicillium chrysogenum has been widely used for producing penicillin and derived β-lactam antibiotics for more than 80 years
 <cit> . the discovery of penicillin has greatly improved human health and promoted the development of the medical industry. in addition to producing penicillin, p. chrysogenum has exhibited abilities in others areas, including bioleaching, biological remediation, promoting plant growth, and producing non-β-lactam antibiotics and antifungal agents
 <cit> . according to previous reports, several p. chrysogenum strains produce secreted proteins, such as paf, pgafp, and pgchp, which inhibit the growth of opportunistic zoopathogens, plant-pathogenic fungi, and toxigenic molds
 <cit> . with their high stability, effective inhibitory activity, and broad inhibition spectra, these three proteins could be effective antifungal agents in medicine and agriculture
 <cit> .

in  <dig>  van den berg et al. reported the first sequence of the p. chrysogenum genome and genes that were responsible for key steps in penicillin production were identified
 <cit> . the genome not only led to a deeper understanding of penicillin synthesis, but also provided a new tool for identifying additional metabolites
 <cit> . the sequenced p. chrysogenum strain wisconsin 54- <dig> was a model laboratory strain that was derived from wild-type nrrl  <dig>  which was isolated from infected cantaloupe
 <cit> . as a mutant strain used in the laboratory, wisconsin 54- <dig> might be some genetic variations, such as reduced paha activity, encoded by paha, in the catabolism of phenylacetic acid 
 <cit> . moreover, different p. chrysogenum isolates maintain diverse genetic backgrounds
 <cit> , and studying the genome sequences of other strains will providemore information on the genetic diversity of p. chrysogenum. therefore, sequencing the genome of a wild-type p. chrysogenum strain is necessary.

p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> is a wild-type strain isolated from a soil sample by our laboratory. it shows high-anti-fungal activity against ustilaginoidea virens, which causes false smut disease of rice and corn in humid areas
 <cit> , in contrast to the wisconsin 54- <dig> strain, which did not exhibit anti-fungal activity. this suggested that there might be differences in the genetic backgrounds of the two strains. to provide more genetic information on p. chrysogenum to identify additional active substances and to determine the critical genes involved in the biosynthesis of the active substances, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of kf- <dig>  comparative genome analysis of strain kf- <dig> with wisconsin 54- <dig> and the wild-type strain nrrl  <dig> revealed significant genetic variance. we also analyzed the functions and distribution of the genes encoding several important proteins, including transporters, non-ribosomal peptide synthase, and two-component regulatory systems .

RESULTS
strain features
the colony morphology and anti-fungal activity of strains kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> were investigated. following grown on potato-sucrose-agar  plates for 5 days, flavescent water drops were observed on the surface of kf- <dig> colonies, but not on wisconsin 54- <dig> . strain kf- <dig> also produced more yellow pigment than wisconsin 54- <dig> . the anti-fungal activities of the two strains against u. virens strain uv- <dig> were tested, and results showed that strain kf- <dig> had a strong inhibitory effect on uv- <dig> , while no anti-fungal activity was observed for strain wisconsin 54- <dig> . the fermentation broth of kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> was analyzed by using hplc-dad and an additional peak was observed at time point  <dig>  min in the hplc chromatogram of kf- <dig> . the component was collected from time point  <dig> to 8 min and the collected component showed a high activity against uv- <dig> . as strain kf- <dig> is a wild isolate and wisconsin 54- <dig> is a mutant strain derived from nrrl 1951
 <cit> , the different origins might cause the different physiological features.

genome sequence and annotation of p. chrysogenum kf-25
general genome features
the genome of p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> was sequenced by a shotgun approach using hiseq  <dig>  with a read length of 2 × 100 bp. the  <dig>  mb genome was covered by  <dig> scaffolds and composed of  <dig>  contigs with 154× coverage. among the  <dig> scaffolds, the average length was 154 kb, with the largest being  <dig>  mb. the general features of the kf- <dig> genome compared with the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome are shown in table 
 <dig>  genome annotation revealed that the genome of strain kf- <dig> encoded  <dig>  orfs, and that the gc content of the predicted protein-coding region was  <dig> %. among the  <dig>  orfs,  <dig> were similar to proteins in uniprot database,  <dig>  proteins were similar to proteins in the kegg database , and  <dig>  showed similarity to proteins from the ncbi nr database. analysis of the  <dig>  orfs by kognitor indicated that  <dig>  predicted proteins matched members of the eukaryotic orthologous groups  . in the genome of strain kf- <dig>   <dig> genes encoding trna and  <dig> rdna genes were predicted using trnascan and rnammer software. the  <dig> trna genes were mainly scattered between scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  although sometimes four or five trna genes formed clusters. the anticodon usage of kf- <dig> is listed in additional file
1: table s <dig>  among the  <dig>  predicted orfs,  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as translation and transcription factors, respectively. .

in total,  <dig> repetitive elements were found in the genome of strain kf- <dig> by repeatscout, with a minimum length 50 bp and a maximum length of  <dig>  bp. repetitive sequence analysis by using censor indicated that  <dig>  bp of the kf- <dig> genome  was repeat sequences, while the repeat content of wisconsin 54- <dig> was  <dig> %
 <cit> .

microsatellites  are one of the most popular genetic markers and exist widely in fungal genomes. because of high mutation rate and changing in repeat numbers during dna replication, ssrs exhibit high individual specificity
 <cit> . in the genome of kf- <dig>   <dig>  ssrs were found, with sizes ranging from 15to 167 bp, and these ssrs were homogenously distributed throughout the genome .

the secretory system and transporter
translocation of protein and molecule across the plasma membrane is essential for cell life and requires the help of secretory systems and transporters, such as signal recognition particle  and the sec translocase
 <cit> . srp plays a critical role in targeting of secretory proteins to the cellular membrane
 <cit> , while the sec secretion system is responsible for protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane
 <cit> . p. chrysogenum has been widely used to produce penicillin and some other secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity
 <cit> . the secretory system and transporters are essential for secretion of these antimicrobial substances and for import of their substrates. in the kf- <dig> genome,  <dig> proteins were predicted to be components of the eukaryotic sec-srp secretion systems . these proteins might play important roles in protein secretion in p. chrysogenum. several genes in the genome of kf- <dig> encoded transporters or components of the secretion system that involved in producing penicillin and other secondary metabolites. kf- <dig> genome contained  <dig> genes that encoded transporter proteins, which mainly belonged to the major facilitator superfamily , and the abc transporter superfamily . several genes in the secondary metabolism gene cluster were predicted to encode mfs-type transporters by antismash
 <cit> . the mfs transporters in the penicillin synthesis pathway could regulate the production of penicillin and enhance the sensitivity of p. chrysogenum to phenylacetic acid
 <cit> . many abc superfamily transporters in the kf- <dig> genome were predicted to be multidrug resistance proteins
 <cit> . one abc superfamily transporter was reported to be critical in the export of phenylacetic acid, which is the precursor of penicillin synthesis. there were also several other transporters in the kf- <dig> genome that are involved in sugar, amino acid, cation, and vitamin transport.

two-component regulatory system
tcrss  are found in bacteria, yeast, fungi and plant, and enable organisms to rapidly sense and adapt to specific environments
 <cit> . tcrss consisted of a sensor kinase and a response regulator, and are involved in regulating diverse processes, such as chemotaxis, osmolarity and differentiation
 <cit> . according to previous reports, osmotic pressure regulates the morphogenesis and the secondary metabolism pathways of filamentous fungi via tcrss
 <cit> . increased osmotic pressure stimulated the vegetative growth and conidia formation of p. chrysogenum, and also influenced its respiration and organic acid production
 <cit> . the tcrss that senses osmotic pressure and regulates the life cycle of p. chrysogenum might induce p. chrysogenum produce secondary metabolites, such as penicillin and other bioactive agents. thirteen predicted proteins based in kf- <dig> were involved in tcrss. among these proteins, four contained both the sensor kinase and response regulator domains, four contained only the sensor kinase domains, and the remaining five contained only the response regulator domains . six of the  <dig> predicted proteins were involved in tcrss that sensed and adapted to the osmotic pressure. similar proteins were also found in the genome of wisconsin 54-1255
 <cit>  . the existence of osmotic pressure-associated tcrss in the p. chrysogenum genome might explain the ability of p. chrysogenum to adapt to high osmotic pressure. the other seven predicted tcrss proteins were mainly involved in sensing or adapting to drugs, the cell cycle, or capsular synthesis.

comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis of p. chrysogenum kf-25
comparative genome analysis of p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> and p. chrysogenum wisconsin 54-1255
the genome of p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> was  <dig>  mb smaller than that of p. chrysogenum wisconsin 54- <dig> . the genome of kf- <dig> was composed of  <dig> scaffolds, while the genome of wisconsin 54- <dig> was composed of only  <dig> super-contigs
 <cit> . we speculated that gaps between the scaffolds might be one of the reasons for the smaller genome size of kf- <dig>  genomic alignment showed that the genome of kf- <dig> covered 93% of the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome. the average protein similarity between the predicted proteomes of kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> was  <dig> % . several genome fragments, with a total length of  <dig>  mb, were missing in the kf- <dig> genome. these fragments in the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome were mainly from the 5′- termini of contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the 3′-terminus of contig  <dig>  according to a previous report, these fragments of the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome were not found in the genomes of other sequenced filamentous fungi, such as aspergillus nidulans, aspergillus niger, and aspergillus oxyaze <cit> , and were proposed to contain the p. chrysogenum-specific genes
 <cit> . alignment of the proteomes of the two strains showed that  <dig>   <dig> genes in the genome of wisconsin 54- <dig> were not found in the genome of kf- <dig> , while  <dig>   of these genes were located in the  <dig>  mb of missing fragments. based on these results, we inferred that these genes were not the p. chrysogenum-specific genes, but of wisconsin 54- <dig> strain-specific genes. the biological functions of most proteins encoded by these strain-specific genes are unknown 
 <cit> , though some genes were involved in transport, metabolism, and transcription regulation . the  <dig>  mb of missing fragments contained numerous repeat and transposable elements, and the introns in these regions were typically small and few compared with other regions of wisconsin 54- <dig> genome. because the two sequenced p. chrysogenum strains were isolated from different geographical regions, and because wisconsin 54- <dig> is a laboratory strain tht has undergone several rounds of mutation, the strain-specific sequences in the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome might have evolved by transposition and horizontal gene transfer. furthermore, there were  <dig> strain-specific genes in kf- <dig> genome that were not found in the genome of wisconsin 54- <dig> . these kf- <dig> strain-specific genes mainly exhibited high levels of similarity to genes from aspergillus species and neosartorya fischeri , which are evolutionarily closely related to p. chrysogenum <cit> . the biological functions of the  <dig> kf-25-specific genes are mainly unknown , except for some orfs that were predicted to be involved in transport, metabolism, and signal transduction . among the  <dig> orfs, none were found to be involved in cell mobility, extracellular structures, chromatin structure, and metabolism , but orfs with functions in intracellular trafficking, secretion, vesicular transport, signal transduction, and transcription were frequently found. to confirm that the  <dig>  mb of dna fragments were truly missing from the kf- <dig> genome, three randomly chosen wisconsin 54- <dig> strain-specific genes  from these fragments of were investigated using pcr amplification. the results showed that these genes were detected in the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome but not in the kf- <dig> genome . another one wisconsin 54-1255-specific gene, pc00c <dig> , which is annotated as a 16s ribosomal rna was not detected in either genome. the 16s ribosomal rna gene is widely used to classify bacteria and is reported to only exist in bacterial genomes
 <cit> . blast analysis of pc00c <dig> indicated that it was highly similar to the 16s rdna region of bacteria rugosimonospora sp.  <dig>  and micromonospora sp. hbum <dig> . the 16s rdna found in the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome sequence might be caused by bacterial contamination during sequencing.

wisconsin 54-1255-specific genes from the genome of kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> 

comparative analysis of p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> and other p. chrysogenum strains
according to previous proteomic studies, the improvement process of penicillin production enhanced the expression of some genes, while decreasing
 <cit> . p. chrysogenum wisconsin 54- <dig> is a moderately improved penicillin producer derived from the wild-type p. chrysogenum nrrl  <dig>  which exhibited more secondary metabolism pathways , pathogenicity proteins and virulence proteins compared with wisconsin 54- <dig> and another high penicillin producer p. chrysogenum as-p-78
 <cit> . p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> is a wild-type strain that had a stronger yellow pigment production than wisconsin 54- <dig> . the ability to produce more pigments is representative of a greater number of secondary metabolic pathways, and was a common feature of both kf- <dig> and nrrl  <dig>  several kf-25-specific genes were found to be associated with pathogenicity and virulence. one such gene, kf25_ <dig>  which encodes glucose oxidase, is thought to be involved in virulence because gluconic acid and glucose oxidase are related to pathogenicity of penicillium espansum in apples
 <cit> . glucose oxidase also showed reduced expression in wisconsin 54- <dig>  compared with nrrl 1951
 <cit> . the penicillin synthesis genes were clustered in one group in the genomes of nrrl  <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig>  while several such clusters were found in the as-p- <dig> genome
 <cit> . similar to wild-type nrrl  <dig>  kf- <dig> contained only one penicillin synthesis gene cluster. wild-type p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> and nrrl  <dig> have more secondary metabolism pathways and more pathogenicity and virulence associated genes, which are fitness mechanisms for the wild-type strains to survive in natural environment.

phylogenetic analysis of p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> and the other sequenced filamentous fungi
a concatenated set of the amino acid sequences of  <dig> conserved proteins was used to construct a phylogenetic tree
 <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis  showed a close relationship between kf- <dig> and aspergillus species, and a more distant evolutionary relationship between kf- <dig> and penicillium marneffei and talaromyces stipitatus. p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> was in the same evolutionary branch as wisconsin 54- <dig> and showed a close relationship with penicillium digitatum. this result was consistent with previous reports
 <cit> . a phylogenetic tree constructed based on the amino acid sequences of the β-tubulin also supported the evolutionary relationship of strains from the penicillium genus .

secondary metabolism analysis of p. chrysogenum kf-25
putative secondary metabolism pathways
p. chrysogenum has been known as a penicillin producer for many years
 <cit> . recently, studies have mainly focused on the pathways of penicillin synthesis, and the key genes involving involved in penicillin production have been determined
 <cit> . in additional to penicillin, p. chrysogenum can produce many other secondary metabolites, such as mycotoxin and drugs
 <cit> . in a previous report, smurf analysis predicted that the genome of wisconsin 54- <dig> contains  <dig> secondary metabolism gene clusters
 <cit> . in this study, secondary metabolism gene clusters was predicted using antismash
 <cit> , and  <dig> and  <dig> gene clusters were identified in the genomes of kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> . the predicted products of  <dig> secondary metabolism gene clusters in kf- <dig> were: eight nonribosomal peptides,  <dig> polyketides, two hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthase -polyketide synthases , one hybrid nrps-terpene, one terpene and one siderophore, while the remainding  <dig> gene clusters produced other secondary metabolites . among the  <dig> gene clusters, five were predicted to produce stigmatellin, chalcomycin, epothilone, fumitremorgin and penicillin. the production of penicillin by kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> were verified by hplc . the data showed that wisconsin 54- <dig> exhibited greater ability of producing penicillin than kf- <dig> 

non-ribosomal peptide synthetase
nrpss play important roles in the synthesis of non-ribosomal peptides, which include antibiotics and other important pharmaceuticals
 <cit> . in the p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> genome,  <dig> nrps genes were found and the domain compositions of these predicted nrpss are shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  among the  <dig> predicted nrpss,  <dig> were involved in putative secondary metabolism pathways, while the other six were not. eleven of the  <dig> predicted nrpss, encoded by gene kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  kf25_ <dig>  and kf25_ <dig>  had similar amino acid sequences to hc-toxin synthase. in addition,  <dig> of the predicted mfs transporters encoded by the kf- <dig> genome were identified as hc-toxin efflux carriers. the hc-toxins determine the specificity and virulence of pathogenic fungi toward host plants
 <cit> . the existence of the hc-toxin synthases and hc-toxin efflux carriers suggested that p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> might produce hc-toxin.

polyketide synthase
polyketides, including pigments, antibiotics, and mycotoxins, are a diverse group of secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms and plants. pkss are complex enzymatic systems for producing polyketides
 <cit> . type i and type ii pkss are modular in structure and contain multiple catalytic activity enzymes individually
 <cit> , while the type iii pkss have simple structures
 <cit> . there were  <dig> predicted polyketide synthesis pathways and two predicted hybrid nrps-pks synthesis pathways in the kf- <dig> genome sequence. twenty-four polyketide synthase genes were extracted from the kf- <dig> genome and  <dig> of them were predicted to encode type i pkss. the remaining gene  encoded a type iii pks . thirteen of  <dig> predicted pkss were identified as members of putative secondary metabolism pathways. one such pathway, containing a type i pks was predicted to produce epothilone . according to previous reports, epothilone is produced by myxobacteria and exhibits anticancer activity by targeting the microtubule of the cancer cell
 <cit> . because the kf- <dig> genome contains an epothilone synthesis gene cluster, it is possible that kf- <dig> might be useful in producing this potential anticancer agent. we will further investigate whether kf- <dig> produces epothilone and whether the strain has anticancer activity. type i pkss have similarity to the type-i fatty acid synthases , which are essential in lipid metabolism
 <cit> . the existence of diverse pks genes in the p. chrysogenum kf- <dig> genome suggests that kf- <dig> might produce diverse lipids and polyketides, and that these metabolic products might influence the life cycle of p. chrysogenum.
 <cit>  and is shown on the right. protein domain names were as follows: ks_n, β-ketoacyl synthase, n-terminal domain; ks_c, β-ketoacyl synthase, n-terminal domain; at, acyl transferase; kr, β-keto reductase; pas, phosphopantetheine attachment site; mt, methyltransferase; msp, male sterility protein; th, thioesterase; zbd, zinc-binding dehydrogenase; er, er domain; ad, alcohol dehydrogenase groes-like domain; css_n, chalcone and stilbene synthases, n-terminal domain; abh, α/βhydrolase; po, prolyl oligopeptidase; con, condensation domain; hr, hxxpf-repeated domain; abe, amp-binding enzyme; bl, β-lactamase; aap, amino acid permease. the orfs indicated in red  and blue  are the members of the putative secondary metabolism pathways.  the cytochrome p <dig>  identified in the kf- <dig> genome and cyps of different families are indicated in different colors. the families of the corresponding cyps are indicated beside the name of the proteins.

cytochrome p450
cytochrome p450s  are hemoproteins that are ubiquitously distributed throughout all domains of life and play important and diverse roles in metabolic processes and adaptation to different environmental niches by fungi
 <cit> . cyps participating in numerous primary, secondary, and xenobiotic metabolic reactions have been reported
 <cit> , and several cyps predicted from sequenced microorganism genomes were found to be members of secondary metabolism pathways
 <cit> . cyps can be classified into different families based on the amino acid sequences
 <cit> . ninety cyps were predicted in the kf- <dig> genome  and many of them were members of putative secondary metabolism pathways, including the pathways of pkss, nrpss, andnrps-terpenes. these cyps belonged to  <dig> different families. there were usually one or two cyps per family but some families contained three to six cyps . the classifications of the cyps from the wisconsin 54- <dig> genome were almost the same as those from kf- <dig> genome . as a multicomponent electron transport chain system, cyps are critical in degradation, detoxification, and syntheses of life-critical compounds in organisms
 <cit> . besides their functions in secondary metabolism, cyps also play critical roles in the adaption of organisms to specific ecological niches and the biosynthesis of physiologically important compounds
 <cit> . the existence of so many cyps might be essential for the life cycle p. chrysogenum and the synthesis of the metabolic products, such as penicillin
 <cit> .

p. chrysogenum virus terminal fragment-similar sequences
to date, the genome of only one virus originating from p. chrysogenum has been sequenced, which showed it was a dsrna virus of the chrysovirus genus
 <cit> . dna alignment analysis  showed that numerous sequences in the kf- <dig> genome were similar to the 5′- and 3′-utr of four p. chrysogenum virus dna sequence segments
 <cit> . these sequences were also found in the genome of wisconsin 54- <dig> . the sequences matching the 5′-utr of the virus were mainly composed of 
n
 repeats, which are similar to the translational enhancer elements in the 5′-utr of tobacco viruses
 <cit> . some sequence fragments of kf- <dig> genome matched the 5′-utrs and 3′-utr of virus segment  <dig>  but did not contain regions encoding virus structural proteins. according to previous reports, eukaryotic gneomes contain many sequence of viral origin that have played diverse roles, such as horizontal gene transfer mediated by dsrna viruses, providing resistance to the virus, and promoting the evolution of host organisms
 <cit> . we speculate that p. chrysogenum genome might have obtained the utrs by integrating the viral genome. during the evolutionary process, genes encoding virus structural proteins were eliminated but the utr regions remained. the functions of these sequences in p. chrysogenum genomes are still unknown, but they might provide insertion sites for the virus, or a potential mechanism of viral resistance for p. chrysogenum.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we reported the genome sequence of wild-type p. chrysogenum kf- <dig>  this is the second report of a p. chrysogenum genome, but the first of wild-type strain. comparative genome analysis showed that kf- <dig> genome lacked regions of the genome, totaling  <dig>  mb, that were found in wisconsin 54- <dig> genome, which were previously considered to be p. chrysogenum species-specific regions
 <cit> . however, our results showed that the missing regions were only specific to wisconsin 54- <dig>  these regions contained numerous repeat elements and transposable elements, indicating that these segments might have been obtained by wisconsin 54- <dig> through transposition and horizontal gene transfer during evolution. comparative analysis of kf- <dig> with another wild-type strain, nrrl  <dig>  revealed that they had numerous features in common, such as pigments production, and a greater number of pathogenicity- and virulence-associated genes. based on the phylogenetic tree of  <dig> conserved orthologous proteins, strains kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> maintained a close evolutionary distance. analysis of the tcrss indicated that many proteins were osmolarity tcrss, which may be an adaptive strategy of p. chrysogenum to high osmotic pressure. several gene clusters involved in putative secondary metabolism pathways, and many genes encoding essential enzymes for the biosynthesis of diverse biologically-active agents were found, which could provide foundation for using p. chrysogenum to produce antibiotics including penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. the identification of p. chrysogenum virus utr sequences in the two sequenced p. chrysogenum genomes is helpful for studying the relationship between the virus and its fungal host in evolution. the results of this study can help us to further understand the genetic diversity of p. chrysogenum and shed light on its evolution, biology, environmental adaption and application.
