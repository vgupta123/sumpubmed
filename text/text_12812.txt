BACKGROUND
eukaryotic ribosomal protein l <dig> is a component of the large ribosomal subunit. l <dig> has no prokaryotic ortholog but the gene is essential in yeast  <cit> . cryo-electron microscopy studies of the wheat germ and canine 80s ribosomes revealed that l <dig> is located in a eukaryotic-specific bridge between the large and small subunits  <cit> . the interaction of l <dig> with the 60s ribosome is mediated primarily through binding of the protein to a kink-turn motif in helix  <dig> of the large rrna  <cit> . l <dig> also binds to a kink-turn in the 5’ untranslated region  of its cognate pre-mrna and the mature spliced mrna to auto-regulate its own expression at the level of pre-mrna splicing or mrna translation, respectively  <cit> .

the repertoire of l <dig> functions was expanded by the discovery that the protein is involved in the mechanism that recodes the uga stop codon as selenocysteine  during selenoprotein synthesis  <cit> . in humans, there are  <dig> known selenoprotein genes, whose products play critical roles in anti-oxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism, immunity, and development  <cit> . sec incorporation at the uga/sec codon is dependent on a stem-loop structure, the selenocysteine insertion sequence  element, which is found in the 3’ utr of eukaryotic selenoprotein mrnas. this structure consists of two helices separated by an internal loop with an apical loop or bulge at the top . the core of the secis contains a quartet of non-watson-crick base pairs, including two sheared g•a tandem base pairs which are characteristic of kink-turn motifs. based on structure probing and computer modeling, walczak et al. proposed a three-dimensional structure of the secis in which the rna is kinked at the internal loop, exposing the sheared g•a tandem base pairs in the secis core to the solvent  <cit> . the secis core, which is essential for sec incorporation, is required for binding of two proteins, l <dig> and secis-binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . in vitro studies support a model in which the two proteins bind to the secis element independently, and likely sequentially  <cit> . sbp <dig> has been shown to recruit the sec-trnasec:efsec complex, bind to the ribosome, and induce a conformational change in the a site  <cit> . however, the exact functions of sbp <dig> and l <dig> in uga recoding have not been fully defined, and alternative models have been proposed  <cit> .

a prerequisite for elucidating the mechanism of sec incorporation is a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for protein:secis interactions. l <dig> and sbp <dig> are both members of the l7ae family of rna-binding proteins. in addition to the founding member archaeal ribosomal protein l7ae, this family includes other eukaryotic ribosomal proteins as well as proteins involved in rna processing, ribonucleoprotein assembly, and termination of protein synthesis  <cit> . the l7ae family members share a similar rna-binding domain and characteristically bind to kink-turn motifs in their cognate rna. however, the kink-turn does not represent a single structural motif  <cit> . each protein in the l7ae family has a unique rna-binding specificity, which allows it to distinguish its cognate rna from other kink-turn containing transcripts in the cell. indirect evidence from our lab suggests that the secis core is part of a noncanonical kink-turn, which may explain why the secis is bound by l <dig> and sbp <dig>  but not by other proteins in the l7ae family  <cit> .

we, and others have characterized the sbp2:secis interaction at the molecular level, although no structural studies on the complex have been performed to date. based on rna footprinting experiments, sbp <dig> binds to both sides of the secis core, as well as to the 5’ strand of the internal loop and lower helix  <cit> . the upper helix and a large internal loop in the secis may also be important for recognition by sbp <dig>  <cit> . mutational analysis of sbp <dig> revealed that the l7ae motif is necessary but not sufficient to mediate secis-binding and that additional amino acids in a k-rich region n-terminal to this motif are required  <cit> . the sbp2:secis interaction is critical for human health as mutations in either the sbp <dig> binding site or in the sbp <dig> rna-binding domain result in a reduction in selenoprotein synthesis and a variety of phenotypes  <cit> .

in contrast to sbp <dig>  much less is known about how l <dig> recognizes the secis. we previously showed that l <dig> binds to secis elements from multiple selenoprotein mrnas  <cit> , but the actual l <dig> binding site has not been defined. compared to sbp <dig>  l <dig> is a relatively small protein  and it lacks a k-rich region. structural studies of l <dig> in a complex with its cognate target, the stem-loop from the l <dig> pre-mrna, have defined the rna-binding interface of the protein  <cit> . however, it is not known whether the same amino acids mediate binding to the secis. in this study, we used rna footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis to identify nucleotides and amino acids that are important for the l30:secis interaction.

RESULTS
defining the l <dig> binding site by rna footprinting
eukaryotic secis elements are stem-loop structures containing two highly conserved motifs that are essential for sec incorporation, namely the secis core and the aar motif in an apical bulge or loop. the secis element from the rat phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase  mrna is shown in figure 1a. we previously showed that binding of l <dig> to the phgpx secis was abrogated by mutations in the sheared g•a tandem base pairs in the secis core, but not by deletion of the aar motif  <cit> . in order to define the l <dig> binding site on the secis, we used enzymatic rna footprinting. the 32p-labeled phgpx secis rna was incubated in the presence or absence of purified rat l <dig>  the native rna and rna:protein complexes were then partially digested with different ribonucleases and analyzed by electrophoresis. regions of cleavage and protection were identified by comparing samples with rna sequencing reactions  and alkali ladders. a schematic illustrating the results is shown in figure 1a and a gel representative of  <dig> independent experiments is shown in figure 1b.

the cleavage results with the native rna are consistent with the published structure of the phgpx secis, which was determined by enzymatic and chemical probing  <cit> . rnase t <dig>  which cleaves after single-stranded g bases, cleaved the native phgpx secis rna in the apical region, both strands of the secis core, and the 3’ side of the internal loop . similar results were obtained when the secis was partially digested with rnase a, which cleaves at single-stranded c and u bases. cleavage by rnase a was detected in the 5’ side of the secis core, the apical loop, as well as both sides of the internal loop. both rnase a and t <dig> cleaved at the base of helix  <dig>  suggesting that this region may breathe due to imperfect base pairing. rnase v <dig>  which cleaves in double-stranded regions, cleaved at multiple positions in helix  <dig> and helix  <dig>  we also observed faint v <dig> digestion in the large internal loop, which suggests that this region may occasionally form an alternate structure.

when the secis was incubated with  <dig>  or  <dig>  μm l <dig>  there was a marked reduction in cleavage by rnase t <dig> on both sides of the secis core  and along the 3’ side of the internal loop  <dig> . we were unable to achieve full protection by increasing the amount of l <dig> in the binding reaction, most likely due to the high on/off rate of the l30:secis complex as determined by surface plasmon resonance . g <dig> and g <dig> in the apical region and g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig> at the base of helix  <dig> were not reproducibly protected by l <dig> from rnase t <dig> cleavage.

when the l30:secis complexes were partially digested with rnase a, there was a reduction in cleavage in the 5’ side of the internal loop and secis core  and the 3’ side of the internal loop . other bases in the internal loop  and the base of helix  <dig> were still cleaved by rnase a in the presence of l <dig>  similarly, the binding of l <dig> did not protect nucleotides in helix  <dig> or helix  <dig> from rnase v <dig> cleavage. taken together, our results show that binding of l <dig> protects nucleotides in the secis core and in the 5’ and 3’ sides of the internal loop. we previously showed that sbp <dig> interacts with both sides of the secis core, the 5’ strand of the internal loop, and the 5’ strand of helix  <dig>  but not with the 3’ side of the internal loop  <cit> . thus the two proteins bind to similar but not identical regions of the secis, as illustrated in figure 2a.

l <dig> represses uga recoding in vitro and this inhibition is rescued by sbp2
the fact that the sbp <dig> and l <dig> binding sites overlap is consistent with our earlier finding that purified recombinant l <dig> and sbp <dig> compete for binding in vitro to an isolated secis in the absence of other factors  <cit> . to test whether this competition could occur during translation, we used a luciferase reporter construct and a modified rabbit reticulocyte lysate  system. this assay has been previously validated to be specific for uga recoding  <cit> . the luc/uga/phgpx reporter rna contains a uga/sec codon at position  <dig> in the open reading frame and the phgpx secis in the 3’ utr. since rrl contains very little sbp <dig>  we added recombinant sbp2-ct, which represents the c-terminal half of the protein and encodes all known functions of sbp <dig>  translation assays were supplemented with purified  <dig> nm sbp2-ct to be within the linear range of the assay. reactions were performed in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of l <dig>  and the products were analyzed for luciferase activity.

as shown in figure 3a , the addition of exogenous l <dig> inhibited recoding of luc/uga/phgpx in a dose-dependent manner. this effect is codon-specific and secis-dependent as the inhibition was not observed when the reactions were primed with a luc/ugu/phgpx reporter construct, which contains a ugu/cys codon  or a normal luciferase rna that lacks a secis element . the addition of l <dig> also repressed uga recoding directed by the secis element from thioredoxin reductase  <dig>  . we hypothesized that the exogenous l <dig> protein interacted with the secis and prevented binding of sbp <dig>  which is limiting in our translation system. to test this competitive model, we added increasing amounts of sbp <dig> to the translation reaction while keeping the amount of l <dig> constant. as shown in figure 3b, the inhibitory effect of l <dig> on recoding from the tr <dig> secis was rescued by the addition of sbp <dig>  similar results were obtained using the luc/uga/phgpx construct . taken together, these results demonstrate that sbp <dig> and l <dig> can functionally compete in an in vitro translation system.

mutations in l <dig> inhibit secis-binding
the l7ae family members are functionally diverse and recognize a variety of targets. a number of these rna:protein complexes have been analyzed at the structural level  <cit> . an emerging theme from these studies is that the l7ae family members bind to their different cognate rnas in a similar manner. therefore, we designed site-directed mutations based on the solution structures of yeast l <dig> in complex with the stem-loop from the l <dig> pre-mrna target, which were solved by nmr spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography  <cit> . an induced fit model was proposed in which l <dig> folds into an α/β/α sandwich, with the three loops at the end of the sandwich in direct contact with the rna  <cit> . we generated alanine point mutations in these functionally important regions, including l <dig> in the first loop of the α/β/α sandwich, l <dig> and k <dig> in the α <dig> region, and k <dig>  y <dig>  and v <dig> in the α4–β <dig> loop . we also mutated m <dig> and e <dig> in the c-terminal region, as these residues are present in l <dig> sequences from higher eukaryotes and sbp <dig>  but not in s <dig>  an l7ae family member that does not bind the secis  <cit> .

the wild-type and mutant l <dig> proteins were analyzed for purity by sds-page  and for rna-binding activity using rna electrophoretic mobility shift assays . the rat phgpx secis element and the stem-loop structure from the yeast l <dig> pre-mrna  were used as 32p-labeled probes. as shown in figure 5a, the wild-type protein bound to the secis in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent kd of ~  <dig>  μm, which is comparable to what was previously reported  <cit> . the affinity of l <dig> for the l <dig> rna was several-fold higher with a kd of  <dig>  μm . we performed a survey of the mutant proteins, using a protein concentration at which 50% of the probe was bound by the wild-type l <dig>  representative remsas are shown in figure 6a, and the graphs of the results from  <dig> and  <dig> independent experiments, respectively, are presented in figure 6b.

we found that the amino acid requirements for l <dig> binding to the secis and the l <dig> rna are similar but not identical. the y89a mutant protein was the most defective, with 32% and 37% binding to the secis and l <dig> rna, respectively, compared to the wild-type protein. we also identified two mutations that selectively inhibited binding of l <dig> to one target rna but not the other. as shown in figure 6b, the k <dig> mutation in rat l <dig> reduced binding to the secis by 40% but had little effect on the l30:l <dig> rna interaction. in contrast the k36a mutant protein was more impaired in its ability to interact with the l <dig> rna  than the secis . there was a slight  reduction in binding of the l35a mutant to both the secis and l <dig> rna, but only the latter result was statistically significant . the other mutants, l29a, v91a, m108a, and e110a, were comparable to the wild-type protein with respect to their ability to bind to both targets.

we also analyzed several mutant l <dig> proteins for their ability to inhibit uga recoding in our in vitro translation system. as shown in figure  <dig>  the l29a and m108a mutant proteins, which have wild-type levels of secis-binding activity, reduced uga recoding by ~50%, similar to wild-type l <dig>  however, the k36a and y89a mutants, that are defective in secis-binding, only reduced uga recoding by 9% and 4% respectively thus, there was a correlation between the ability of l <dig> to bind to the secis and repress recoding in vitro.

a naturally occurring secis mutation inhibits l <dig> binding
one interesting finding from the footprinting experiments was that l <dig> protected u <dig> in the secis core. a previous study identified a naturally occurring u to c point mutation at this position in the selenoprotein n  secis element from a patient with a mild form of rigid spine muscular dystrophy  <cit> . seln expression was impaired in this patient, and this mutation was shown to abrogate binding of sbp <dig> to the seln and phgpx secis elements  <cit> . we hypothesized that the mutant rna may also be defective in the l30:secis interaction, as l <dig> and sbp <dig> have overlapping binding sites . the 32p-labeled wild-type and u40c mutant secis rnas were incubated with increasing amounts of purified l <dig> protein. the rna:protein complexes were uv cross-linked, digested with rnase a, and analyzed by sds-page electrophoresis and autoradiography. as shown in figure 2b, l <dig> cross-linked to the wild-type secis but not to the u40c mutant rna. thus, defects in selenoprotein synthesis in patients with mutant secis elements may not be solely due to an impaired sbp2:secis interaction.

discussion
as members of the l7ae family, l <dig> and sbp <dig> share a similar rna-binding domain. however, there are important differences in how the two proteins interact with the secis. our rna footprinting experiments revealed that the binding site of l <dig> centers on the secis core and internal loop. l <dig> protects nucleotides in the secis core, including the gs in the two, sheared g•a tandem base pairs that form the putative kink-turn motif. the protein also protects many of the nucleotides in the internal loop. thus, the l <dig> binding site described here overlaps with the regions that have been shown to be protected by sbp <dig> binding, including the secis core and 5’ side of the internal loop  <cit> . in addition to sharing these common nucleotide requirements, l <dig> and sbp <dig> each have unique determinants for binding to the secis. we show here that l <dig> protects the 3’ side of the internal loop, which is distinct from the known sbp <dig> binding site  <cit> . likewise, sbp <dig> protects nucleotides in the upper part of helix  <dig>  which are not part of the l <dig> binding site.

the fact that the binding sites of l <dig> and sbp <dig> overlap provides a molecular explanation for our earlier finding that the two proteins cannot interact simultaneously with the secis  <cit> . our results also have implications for interpreting defects in sbp2:secis interactions that are associated with human disease. a naturally occurring point mutation in a highly conserved nucleotide in the seln secis that was previously shown to disrupt sbp <dig> binding and selenoprotein synthesis also inhibited binding of l <dig>  thus, it is important to keep in mind that mutant secis elements may be defective in more than one function.

to date, the secis element is the only known cognate rna for sbp <dig>  in contrast, l <dig> binds to several other kink-turn containing targets, including the l <dig> pre-mrna, l <dig> mature mrna, and 28s ribosomal rna. as the structure of the sbp2:secis complex has not been solved, we turned to the nmr and co-crystal structures of the yeast l <dig> protein in a complex with the l <dig> pre-mrna to guide our mutational analysis. we chose to design site-specific mutations in regions defined as the rna-binding interface for the l30:l <dig> pre-rna interaction. interestingly, the crystal structure of a 60s ribosomal subunit from the fresh water ciliate tetrahymena thermophila was recently published, and it is the first such structure from an organism that synthesizes selenoproteins  <cit> . using the published coordinates, we utilized several molecular modeling programs to analyze the structure of l <dig> on the ribosome where it is bound to helix  <dig> of the 26s rrna . t. thermophila l <dig> appears to use a similar rna-binding interface to bind to a kink-turn in helix  <dig>  as the yeast protein uses to bind to the l <dig> pre-mrna. thus, we expected that some of the same amino acids might also be important for the l30:secis interaction. indeed, the y89a mutant protein was defective in binding to both the secis and the l <dig> rna, its canonical target. this residue is equivalent to f <dig> in the yeast protein, where it is the most prominent amino acid contact in the l30:l <dig> pre-mrna complex  <cit> . based on mutagenesis studies, an aromatic group is required at this position for binding of the yeast protein to the l <dig> rna  <cit> , and a similar requirement may be true for the l30:secis interaction.

unlike y <dig>  mutagenesis of k <dig> and k <dig> had selective effects on the interaction of l <dig> with the two target rnas. the k36a mutation had a greater inhibitory effect on binding of the protein to the l <dig> rna than to the secis. the equivalent amino acid in the yeast protein, k <dig>  did not directly contact the rna in the nmr and crystal structures of the l30:l <dig> rna complex  <cit> . however, it was proposed that this highly conserved amino acid could play an important role by neutralizing the negatively charged phosphate backbone  <cit> . we also found that mutagenesis of l <dig>  which is also in the α <dig> helical region, modestly reduced binding inhibition to both targets. this result was only statistically significant for the l30:l <dig> rna interaction, however.

in contrast, we found that k <dig> is important for the l30:secis interaction, but is dispensable for binding to the l <dig> rna. this was a particularly interesting result as k <dig> is part of a signature motif that has been identified for l <dig>  <cit> . it is well established that each l7ae family member has a unique rna-binding specificity. however the basis for this selectivity has not been well understood as the proteins share a relatively conserved rna-binding domain. an elegant study by gagnon et al. recently identified five signature amino acids flanking this region that are unique to each family member  <cit> . one amino acid is n-terminal to the rna-binding domain whereas the other four residues comprise a motif that is c-terminal to the domain. the c-terminal motif in particular is quite different between family members, with respect to the structure and chemical properties of the conserved amino acids. functional evidence was provided for the l7ae and  <dig>  kda proteins, showing that the unique conserved amino acids are necessary although not sufficient to mediate specific binding to the appropriate cognate rna. the consensus n-terminal amino acid for l <dig> and sbp <dig> is a basic residue, k <dig> in rat l <dig> and r <dig> in rat sbp <dig> . k <dig>  which is important for the l30:secis interaction, is the first amino acid in kyyr, the c-terminal signature motif for l <dig>  <cit> . this residue is also highly conserved in sbp <dig> , where it is part of this protein’s signature motif kavp  <cit> . interestingly, k is not present in the first position of the signature motifs for other eukaryotic l7ae family members, including l7ae,  <dig>  kda protein, rpl7a, nhu2p, and rpp38p  <cit> . the unique signature motifs that have evolved in l <dig> and sbp <dig> may explain the ability of these proteins to bind to the secis, which contains a large internal loop and a non-canonical kink-turn motif. as discussed above, the binding of l <dig> to the secis and the l <dig> rna depends on y <dig>  which is the third amino acid in the kyyr motif. sbp <dig> has a v at this position, and mutational analysis of human sbp <dig> showed that this amino acid is important for the sbp2:secis interaction  <cit> . the fact that the signature motifs for l <dig> and sbp <dig> are not identical is consistent with the unique rna-binding specificities of the two proteins, as l <dig> has been shown to bind to multiple cognate rnas whereas the only known target for sbp <dig> is the secis element. an important future direction will be to solve the structures of the l30:secis and sbp2:secis complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
the study presented here provides new insight into how ribosomal protein l <dig> recognizes the secis element. our findings suggest that there are subtle differences in how l <dig> interacts with its different cognate rnas. the results expand our knowledge of how l7ae family members recognize different rna targets.
