BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides  are widely distributed host defense molecules that are produced by certain single-cell organisms, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, as well as all multicellular plants and animals  <cit> . plectasin is a recently reported novel defensin-like amp from pseudoplectania nigrella that has potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and s. suis, including some antibiotic-resistant strains  <cit> . similar to vancomycin, plectasin binds to the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid ii and subsequently prevents the formation of the bacterial cell wall, which inhibits colonization of the pathogens  <cit> . nz <dig> is a novel variant of plectasin that has significantly more potent activities than its parental peptide plectasin  <cit> . nz <dig> is active against various strains of s. pneumoniae and s. aureus in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . to further improve its antibacterial activity and physical and chemical properties, a new sequence named mp <dig> was designed which had three mutational sites  compared to nz <dig> in our laboratory. the minimal inhibitory concentrations  of mp <dig> for s. aureus atcc <dig>  atcc <dig> and atcc <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively, and these values were equal to or more potent than those of its parental peptide nz <dig>  which are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively.

the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris has been successfully used as a host system for the expression of heterologous proteins. the high-level expression of heterologous protein by p. pastoris has typically been achieved using a paox <dig> expression system. however, this system is inconvenient during fermentation due to tedious processing and can create environmental pollution or fires during transportation. a constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  promoter was used as an alternative to the aox promoter . gap is essential in carbohydrate metabolism; thus the target proteins of this promoter are expressed during the growth of the host. consequently, cultivation is simplified because methanol is not needed as a carbon source. it gave comparable expression levels to the aox <dig> promoter for some proteins, including β-lactamase  <cit> , xylanase  <cit> , and human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor  <cit> . however, the operations manual of gap promoter in p. pastoris indicated that toxic target proteins to the pichia cell cannot be expressed with high yields . consequently, only ll <dig> , human α-defensin  <dig>  and cecropin d  have been expressed with the gap promoter  <cit> . nz <dig> is a peptide that has low toxicity to host cells and is produced at high levels in p. pastoris expression systems  <cit> . mp <dig> is an nz2114-derived antimicrobial peptide without toxicity to p. pastoris that has been expressed behind the aox promoter to produce a yield of 695 mg/l , which is lower than the production of nz <dig> . the gap promoter was used as an alternative to the aox promoter in this study.

in the p. pastoris expression system using the gap promoter, the carbon source is the key element for heterologous protein expression  <cit> . additionally, the medium is another key factor for the high-level expression of heterologous protein. various types of basal salts media  are widely used at the fermenter level in p. pastoris expression systems. however, the definite and limited nutrients of bsm are not suitable for the large-scale production of all proteins. an effective and cheap industrial medium is urgently needed for the industrial production of mp <dig> 

in the present study, the recombinant plasmid pgapmp <dig> was constructed and transformed into p. pastoris x- <dig>  the optimum carbon source and its concentration were determined. additionally, the effects of oxoid and hrbs yeast extracts and peptones  were compared, and the effects of five different ph values were evaluated in a 5-l fermenter using fed-batch fermentation. the recombinant mp <dig>  was purified with a cation-exchange column and confirmed by matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry .

RESULTS
vector construction and screening of positive transformant
as shown in figure  <dig>  the pgapmp <dig> plasmid contained an inserted target mp <dig> fragment of 120 bp. all positive transformants were verified by sequencing. the correct pgapmp <dig> recombinant plasmid was linearized with avrii and transformed into p. pastoris x- <dig> by electroporation. the positive transformants were screened by pcr using gap gene-specific and mp <dig> gene-specific primers, and an empty ppiczαa vector transformant was used as the negative control .figure  <dig>

unlike the aox <dig> promoter, which is inactive on glucose and glycerol and requires methanol to initiate target gene expression, the gap promoter constitutively expresses target proteins on different carbon sources  <cit> . the yield of rmp <dig> increased with increasing carbon source concentrations until  <dig> g/l. the maximum total protein level, rmp <dig> yield and antimicrobial activity were  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and 6400 au/ml, respectively, after 96 h of cultivation at an initial glucose concentration of 40 g/l . additionally, rmp <dig> was not secreted into the medium at high levels when low concentrations  of any of the three carbon sources were used. however, the yields of rmp <dig> decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/l in glucose and maltose, respectively at concentrations of 50 g/l , which suggested that excessive high carbon source concentrations did not benefit the production of rmp <dig> figure  <dig>

medium selection for the high-level production of rmp1102
to identify the best medium for the high-level production of rmp <dig>  six different media were examined. as shown in figure 3c, the highest total protein and rmp <dig> yield of  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l were observed with med- <dig> following 120 h of cultivation. to further improve this yield and identify a suitable medium for rmp <dig> production, yeast extracts and peptones from oxoid and hrbs  were added. the higher total protein, rmp <dig> yield and antimicrobial activity of  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and 12800 au/ml were observed following the addition of industrial yeast extract and peptone to med- <dig> ; this yield was  <dig>  times that observed with med- <dig> alone. additionally, the total protein, rmp <dig> yield and antimicrobial activity were  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and 9600 au/ml following the use of med- <dig> with added oxoid yeast extract and peptone . tricine-sds–page revealed a target band of rmp <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda that was more obvious following the use of med- <dig> with hrbs yeast extract and peptone than the medium that contained oxoid , which suggesting that industrial yeast extract and peptone were more suitable for the production of rmp <dig> figure  <dig>

development of fed-batch cultivation in bioreactors
the experiments involving the fermentation of rmp <dig> in 5-l fermenters focused on ph because ph is the key factor that influences the yields of target proteins  <cit> . the total protein level, rmp <dig> yield and antimicrobial activity of the fermentation supernatant increased from  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  au/ml, respectively, at ph  <dig>  to the maximum values of  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  au/ml, respectively, at ph <dig>  . however, the corresponding values decreased to  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  au/ml at ph  <dig> , which was not the perfect condition for the growth of the host and target peptide production in p. pastoris. this pattern of productivity paralleled the absolute antimicrobial activity values. the lowest productivity was 104464 au/mg rmp <dig>  which was observed at the ph of  <dig> , and the maximum max value occurred in ph  <dig>  and was 285412 au/mg rmp <dig>  however, productivity did not increase when the ph was raised to  <dig>  . moreover, a wider target band resulted from ph  <dig>  compared to the other ph values . additionally, the cell wet weights and total protein levels increased with the process of cultivation in all ph values . the total protein level increased to the maximums at  <dig> and 96 h in the phs of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . however, the highest total protein level and antimicrobial activity occurred at 120 h at the phs of  <dig>  and  <dig> , which suggested that these conditions were beneficial for the continuous accumulation of rmp <dig>  whereas the target peptides accumulated faster in the low  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ph conditions . rmp <dig> was also expressed in p. pastoris via the inducible method at the 5-l fermenter level. the maximum total protein level was 695 mg/l at 120 h , which was more than 70% reduced compared to the constitutive expression at ph  <dig> . furthermore, another non-target band appeared above rmp <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda. this band might have represented incomplete cleavage by kex <dig> due to the large amount of target peptides that were induced by methanol in a short time  <cit> . in contrast, there only the target rmp <dig> was expressed in each of the assays that used the gap promoter . very few or no other bands appeared around rmp <dig>  which was convenient for the process of purification.table  <dig>

discussion
the main hosts used for amp production are bacteria and yeasts, which are used to produce  <dig> % of the heterologously expressed amps  <cit> . due to the mechanisms of membrane disruption and cell wall compound blocking, which induce death  <cit> , very low yields of target peptides are obtained by directly expressing amps in prokaryotic expression systems. therefore, fusion partners, such as thioredoxin , glutathione-s-transferase  and small ubiquitin-related modifier , have been introduced to avoid host toxicity  <cit> . however, it is quite difficult to recover large fusion proteins at reasonable ratios, so this process is uneconomical and laborious. p. pastoris is a high-yield host for the antimicrobial peptide production and has some advantages over prokaryotic expression systems  <cit> . moreover, compared to mammalian cell cultures, p. pastoris is more cost-effective and grows faster. consequently, the majority of heterologous amps produced in yeast are expressed in p. pastoris  <cit> .

the most commonly used vectors harbor the aox promoter in p. pastoris, which is induced by methanol. many amps have been expressed using this promoter, including hpab-β  <cit> , abp-cm <dig>  <cit>  and ch-penaeidin  <cit> . additionally, fungal defensin-plectasin and its derived peptides nz <dig>  lhp <dig>  and agplectasin have also been successfully expressed using this system in our laboratory with high production rates of 2390 mg/l, 906 mg/l, and 1285 mg/l, respectively  <cit> . however, methanol is a substance that is prone to cause fires during transportation and storage. the gap promoter is an attractive alternative to the aox promoter and might reduce costs and risks during the processes of fermentation and transportation. it has been shown that the various proteins, such as bacterial β-lactamase  <cit> , d-amino acid oxidase and  <cit> , human angiostatin  <cit> , and functional mammalian membrane transport protein production  <cit> , are more effectively expressed in constitutive systems than in the methanol-inducible system. in this work, all of the positive transformants exhibited some level of antimicrobial activity different levels , however, the maximum total protein and rmp <dig> yield were  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l after 72 h of cultivation , which leaves much room for improvements via the optimization of fermentation.

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is the crucial enzyme in sugar metabolism. consequently, the carbon source is one of the most important factors in the efficiency of the gap promoter  <cit> . the maximal transport activities of rpept <dig> growing on glucose are approximately  <dig> and  <dig> times greater than those on glycerol and methanol, respectively  <cit> . additionally, glucose at 40 g/l is the best choice for both cell growth and lipase production  <cit> . however, glycerol is a better carbon source than glucose or methanol for the production of human angiostatin  <cit> . it was also found that the methanol could also initiate the expression the reporter of β-lactamase, its activity was  <dig> % compared to that of glucose as carbon source  <cit> . therefore, three carbon sources were tested at different concentrations in our work. the findings revealed that the maximum productions in terms of total protein, rmp <dig> yield and antimicrobial activity were  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and 6400 au/ml following 96 h of cultivation at an initial glucose concentration of 40 g/l .

basal salt medium  and fm <dig> are the defined media commonly used in the large-scale production of heterologous proteins  <cit> . the present work revealed that the maximum total protein level and rmp <dig> yield in the defined medium were  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l, which was achieved using med- <dig>  at the shake flask level. additionally, rich media might be more favorable than defined media for the production of some proteins. yeast extract, peptone, and casamino acids are the complex media that are typically added to defined medium  <cit> . these media can enhance the yield of target protein and protect host cells from proteolytic degradation. it has been shown that recombinant human consensus ifn-α  mutant can be highly expressed with a maximum yield of  <dig>  g/l via the addition of yeast extract and peptone  <cit> . similarly, the highest yield of total protein, rmp <dig> and antimicrobial activity of  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  and 12800 au/ml was observed following the use of med- <dig> supplemented with crude industrial yeast extract and peptone . however, the yield of total protein, rmp <dig> and antimicrobial activity reduced to  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and 9600 au/ml when med- <dig> supplemented with oxoid yeast extract and peptone was used , which suggests that industrial media are more suitable for the high-level production of this target peptide. this difference might be due to the extensive machining processes that might keep the certain micronutrients in the industrial grade medium that improved target peptide yield. however, the exact mechanism will be studied in our future work. moreover, the costs of industrial yeast extract and peptone were $  <dig>  and  <dig>  per kilogram , which were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times lower than the costs of the oxoid components, respectively ; thus, the industrial yeast extract and peptone are likely more suitable for large-scale production.table  <dig>

because p. pastoris grows in a wide range of phs, the optimization of fermentation is typically adapted within these limits to provide the best conditions for individual proteins  <cit> . the expression level of sediii- <dig> is highest at a ph of  <dig> , and this level is 20–25% higher than those achieved at other ph values  <cit> . moreover, it has been found that an induction ph of  <dig>  results in a merozoite surface protein  <dig>  yield of at 434 mg/l, whereas this is no product at ph  <dig>  despite though cell growth being identical across all ph levels  <cit> . consequently, ph values of  <dig>  to  <dig>  were selected for rmp <dig> production at the 5-l fermenter level. the greatest amount of total protein, rmp <dig> yield and antimicrobial activity were  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  au/ml in ph  <dig> , with the highest productivity and specific cell growth rate of 285412 au/mg rmp <dig> and  <dig> , respectively , which corroborates the notion that, under the gap promoter, the target peptide production was accompanied by the growth of host cells  <cit> . furthermore, this was the highest yield of antimicrobial peptide achieved using the gap promoter and thus provides a practical system for the large-scale production of antimicrobial peptides with structures similar to that of mp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, the novel nz2114-derived peptide mp <dig> was expressed in p. pastoris using the gap promoter. four percent initial glucose and med- <dig> were identified as the best carbon source and medium, respectively, among three carbon sources and six media. moreover, the replacement of oxoid peptone and yeast extract  with hrbs  was beneficial in terms of a higher yield of rmp <dig>  additionally, the total protein level, rmp <dig> yield, and antimicrobial activity increased from  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l, and  <dig>  au/ml, respectively, in ph  <dig>  to the maximum values of  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  au/ml, respectively, at in ph  <dig> . together, the above results provide an economical strategy that is suitable the production of rmp <dig> at the industrial level under the control of the gap promoter in p. pastoris for the first time.
