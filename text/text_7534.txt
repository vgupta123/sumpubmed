BACKGROUND
the mrna and protein generated from the fmr <dig> gene in neurons is localized to dendrites  <cit> . the fmr <dig> protein, fmrp is synthesized in response to neural activity and its function as an rna binding protein influences the translational level of other dendritically localized mrnas  <cit> . fmrp is also part of the risc complex  <cit> , a set of proteins that interact with micro-rnas or short interfering rnas to inhibit translation and or degrade the rna, respectively.

regulating the synthesis of fmrp is important for cellular function. fmrp over-expression leads to a defect in dendritic architecture, synaptic differentiation, and abnormal behaviors in mice and flies  <cit> . alternatively, the absence of fmrp in fragile x syndrome  leads to alterations in synaptic plasticity resulting in mental retardation  <cit> . fxs develops from an expansion of the cgg nucleotide repeats in the 5' leader of the fmr <dig> gene  <cit> . normal individuals carry from  <dig> –  <dig> repeats while those with fxs carry over  <dig> repeats. the expansion increases methylation of the gene inhibiting transcription. in some cases transcription of the gene occurs  <cit> , but translation of the mrna is inhibited by the presence of the cgg repeat expansion  <cit> . the cgg repeats are evolutionarily conserved in mammals suggesting that the repeats have some function aside from inhibiting transcription and translation  <cit> .

during post-transcriptional gene processing, a 7-methyl guanosine  is positioned at the 5' end of an mrna  <cit> . all mrnas can potentially be translated by the eukaryotic initiation factor  4e binding to the cap structure and recruiting the remainder of the translational machinery including the ribosome  <cit> . on the other hand, a subset of mrnas initiate translation in a cap-independent manner through internal ribosomal entry sites  situated in the 5' leader and in some cases in the open reading frame  <cit> . ires-dependent translation is thought to be utilized when cap-dependent translation is inhibited. this occurs during normal physiological processes including mitosis, but also in response to stressful events such as apoptosis  <cit> . it may also be a primary translational mechanism that can be regulated independently of pathways affecting cap-dependent translation. in the nervous system, numerous dendritically localized mrnas contain ireses including those coding for the alpha subunit of camkii, activity-related cytoskeletal protein, and the neurotrophin receptor trkb  <cit> . the high preponderance of dendritically localized mrnas containing ireses suggests that ires-dependent translation is an important protein synthesis mechanism in dendrites.

our goals were to confirm a previous study that the fmr <dig> 5' leader mediates internal initiation of translation  <cit> , identify regions in the fmr <dig> 5' leader critical for ires activity, and to determine if fmr <dig> ires activity is affected by cellular processes in which fmrp participates. initially, we re-examined the fmr <dig> 5' leader for ires activity and found that it contained a cryptic promoter, compelling the use of rna constructs. translation assays using rna both in vitro and ex vivo demonstrated that the fmr <dig> 5' leader does contain an ires and that ires-dependent translation may be an important mechanism for the synthesis of fmrp in vivo. a dissection of the 5' leader showed that the 5'  <dig> nucleotides  as well as the cgg repeats are important for internal initiation. finally, multiple cellular stimuli including exposure to kcl and intracellular acidification as models for neural activity and exposure to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid as a model for the presence of double stranded rna resulted in alterations of fmr <dig> ires activity.

RESULTS
the fmr <dig> 5' leader directs expression of the second cistron in a dicistronic dna construct
viral ireses are denoted by being relatively long , guanosine/cytosine  nt rich, and containing upstream open reading frames . the fmr <dig> 5' leader exhibits a subset of these characteristics being approximately  <dig> nt  and is > 80% g/c rich, but it does not contain any uorfs. to confirm a previous report that the fmr <dig> 5' leader contained an ires  <cit> , the leader was inserted into the intercistronic region of a dicistronic luciferase construct. two negative controls were used, the multiple cloning site  in the intercistronic region  and the β-globin 5' leader. the β-globin 5' leader was chosen since the β-globin mrna is translated exclusively in a cap-dependent manner  <cit> . the encephalomyocarditis  virus ires was chosen as the positive control  <cit> . the constructs were transfected into the c <dig> glioma and n2a neuroblastoma cell lines. after  <dig> hrs the cells were harvested and assayed for renilla and photinus luciferase. the photinus:renilla luciferase  ratio obtained from the control dicistronic construct  was normalized to one. a ratio above one would indicate ires activity. both the emcv ires and the fmr <dig> 5' leader exhibited p:r ratios significantly higher than that observed from the prf  construct. indeed, the p:r ratio obtained from the fmr <dig> 5' leader was approximately  <dig> and  <dig> fold higher in c <dig> and n2a cells respectively . the level of fmr <dig> ires activity was higher than that observed from the emcv ires. this initial result suggests that the fmr <dig> 5' leader may contain an ires.

the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains a cryptic promoter
in addition to internal initiation, increased levels of photinus luciferase protein can be generated from the dicistronic luciferase constructs through cryptic splicing or cryptic promoter activity. for example, the presence of a cryptic promoter in the 5' leader will lead to the production of a monocistronic photinus luciferase mrna  <cit>  and artificially increase the p:r ratio. to determine if cryptic promoter activity was present in the fmr <dig> 5' leader, the dicistronic luciferase constructs with or without the sv <dig> promoter and intron were transfected into c <dig> cells. photinus luciferase activity from the promoterless constructs containing the prf mcs, β-globin 5' leader, and emcv ires was very low, less than 1% of the photinus luciferase activity obtained from the constructs with the intact promoter. this result confirms previous studies indicating that these leaders do not contain a cryptic promoter  <cit> . however, the promoterless construct containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader generated approximately 15% of the 'total' photinus luciferase activity. after subtracting the minor contribution of the cryptic promoter to the translation of the second cistron, the data still suggests that the fmr <dig> 5' leader has an ires, but it does temper this conclusion.

the fmr <dig> 5' leader exhibits ires activity from a dicistronic rna
to determine more unambiguously whether the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains an ires, the dicistronic constructs were transcribed in vitro eliminating the possibility of alternative splicing and alternate promoters. transfecting the mrna into c <dig> cells did provide evidence of ires activity . the p:r ratio obtained from the dicistronic luciferase mrna containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader was approximately  <dig>  fold higher than the β-globin control. although the p:r ratio generated from the fmr <dig> 5' leader was substantially lower when comparing the rna to dna transfections, the results still indicate that the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains an ires.

translation of a monocistronic mrna in vitro and ex vivo indicates a key role for ires-dependent translation mediated by the fmr <dig> 5' leader
the dicistronic luciferase assay is useful to identify sequences that can internally initiate translation, but it does not indicate the role of an ires in a monocistronic mrna, the context in which the ires is normally found in cellular mrna. consequently, two approaches were utilized to determine whether the fmr <dig> ires is a major contributor to the translation of a monocistronic capped mrna. initially, in vitro transcribed monocistronic mrna containing the photinus luciferase open reading frame  and the β-globin or fmr <dig> 5' leader was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. the overall level of photinus luciferase synthesis was reduced by approximately 40% when the fmr <dig> 5' leader was present. this result is not surprising since cap-dependent translation of a short unstructured 5' leader  is very efficient. increasing concentrations of cap analog were added to the lysate to compete with the cap structure for eif-4e and inhibit cap-dependent translation. translation of the mrna containing the β-globin 5' leader decreased as the concentration of cap analog increased . this result demonstrates that the β-globin mrna is being translated in a cap-dependent manner. on the other hand, translation of the mrna containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader was only moderately affected ; translation of the photinus luciferase cistron decreased by only 15% at the highest concentration of cap analog. this result not only indicates that the mrna containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader is being translated in a cap-independent manner, but that it may be the major mechanism for its translation.

to determine the role of the fmr <dig> ires within a cell, cap-dependent translation was inhibited ex-vivo. the 4e-binding protein  <dig>  binds and sequesters eif-4e preventing cap-dependent translation  <cit> , but phosphorylation of 4e-bp <dig> decreases its affinity to eif-4e. consequently, c <dig> cells were transfected with a construct coding for a mutant of 4e-bp <dig>  with the two key phosphorylation sites mutated  or a control plasmid  <cit> . monocistronic constructs containing the β-globin, emcv, or fmr <dig> 5' leader were co-transfected. in the presence of over-expressed 4e-bpmut, the level of photinus luciferase activity derived from the mrna containing the β-globin 5' leader decreased by 72% . however, translation from the mrnas containing the fmr <dig> or emcv 5' leader only decreased by 19% and 27%, respectively . since 81% of the luciferase activity remains when cap-dependent translation is inhibited, it indicates that ires-dependent translation may be the primary mechanism for translation of the fmr <dig> mrna in vivo.

endogenous fmrp expression is unaffected by reducing cap-dependent translation
to examine whether ires-dependent translation is utilized for the synthesis of endogenous fmrp, cap-dependent translation was inhibited by treating c <dig> cells with rapamycin. the mammalian target of rapamycin  is a kinase that is a key link in the promotion of cap-dependent translation by phosphorylating 4e-bp and p <dig> s <dig> kinase. exposure to  <dig> nm rapamycin for  <dig> hrs actually led to a modest increase in fmrp expression . phosphorylation of p <dig> s <dig> kinase was abolished demonstrating that the mtor pathway was inhibited and the expression level of eif-4e was decreased indicating cap-dependent translation was repressed . these results indicate that fmrp can be expressed under conditions in which cap-dependent translation is impeded.

in addition to inhibiting cap-dependent translation, blocking mtor activity can alter other cellular pathways and indirectly alter translation. to more directly examine whether ires-dependent translation is utilized for the synthesis of endogenous fmrp, cap-dependent translation was inhibited by knocking-down expression of eif-4e. c <dig> cells were exposed to a pool of sirna  directed against the eif-4e mrna or a nonsense sirna for  <dig> hr. quantitation of western blots showed that eif-4e expression was reduced by > 70% . the level of the transcription factor junb whose mrna is translated in a cap-dependent manner was also reduced by > 75%. however, fmrp expression was decreased by only 12% . the observations that fmrp expression is maintained despite reduced levels of eif-4e or mtor activity  indicates that ires-dependent translation is likely a important contributor to the synthesis of fmrp.

multiple regions in the 5' leader contribute to fmr <dig> ires activity
a deletional analysis was performed to identify regions in the fmr <dig> 5' leader important for ires activity. serial 5' truncations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length were created. the abridged 5' leaders were inserted into the dicistronic luciferase construct and in vitro transcribed mrna was transfected into c <dig> cells. the initial truncations resulted in a loss of ires activity. truncating the nt from - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in the largest decrease in ires activity with the resulting p:r ratio being only  <dig>  fold over that obtained from the β-globin control . deleting an additional  <dig> nt  abolished all ires activity. additional truncations of  <dig> nt  actually led to an increase in the p:r ratio of approximately  <dig>  fold over the control value. further truncations of  <dig> and  <dig> nt  that encompassed the cgg repeats resulted in a decrease and complete loss of ires activity, respectively. these results indicate that 1) the 5' end of the 5' leader is important for wild-type ires activity, 2) an internal region may be inhibitory, and 3) the region including - <dig> – - <dig> exhibits a basal level of ires activity. interestingly, this latter region encompasses the cgg repeats of which nine are contained in the present 5' leader.

changes in intracellular ph regulate the fmr <dig> ires
to determine the regulatory elements in the fmr <dig> ires, c <dig> cells were exposed to  <dig> μm ameloride for  <dig> hrs to block the na+/h+ antiporter. intracellular acidification inhibits neural activity and is a model of an inactive neuron  <cit> . the p:r ratio from the dicistronic mrna containing the full-length 5' leader dramatically decreased in the presence of ameloride . however, only subtle differences in the p:r ratio were observed from truncations of the 3'  <dig> nt. the minimal level of ires activity remained in the shorter leaders. this result implies that a decrease in intracellular ph inhibits fmr <dig> ires activity and this effect is mediated by repressing the ires-promoting region located at the 5' end of the 5' leader.

the cgg repeats contribute to fmr <dig> ires activity
the basal level of ires activity exhibited in the 5' leader containing the 3'  <dig> nt was not affected by changes in intracellular ph. an additional truncation deleting the cgg repeats abolished all ires activity. to further characterize the role of the cgg repeats in the fmr <dig> ires, the repeats were internally deleted within the full-length 5' leader. transfection of the dicistronic mrna containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader with the cgg repeats deleted exhibited an approximately 50% decrease in the p:r ratio compared to the full-length 5' leader . this result demonstrates the importance of the cgg repeats for internal initiation mediated by the fmr <dig> 5' leader.

fmr <dig> ires activity is affected by kcl and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid
ires-dependent translation is affected by multiple cellular stimuli  <cit> . we sought to determine whether the fmr <dig> ires is regulated by environmental stimuli which regulate the processes in which fmrp participates. neural activity leads to translation of fmr <dig> mrna  <cit>  and we modeled this phenomenon by treating cells with  <dig> mm kcl for  <dig> or  <dig> min. the short kcl exposure led to a 32% increase in the p:r ratio from the dicistronic mrna containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader . however, the longer kcl treatment resulted in a 28% decrease in the p:r ratio. moreover, the fmr <dig> p:r ratio after the  <dig> min treatment was only one-third higher than that obtained from the control dicistronic mrna. this result indicates that cellular depolarization differentially affects fmr <dig> ires activity depending upon its duration.

to examine whether kcl also affects fmrp expression, western blots were performed from lysates obtained from the treated and untreated cells. changes in endogenous fmrp levels mirrored that observed from fmrp ires . an increase of 58% was seen after a  <dig> min kcl treatment, whereas a  <dig> min treatment led to a 40% decrease in fmrp expression.

fmrp has been localized to the rna-induced silencing complex , a nuclease complex that mediates rna interference . deletion of fmrp leads to a loss of rnai  <cit> . to determine if the presence of double stranded rna affects fmr <dig> ires activity, c <dig> cells were exposed to  <dig> μg/ml of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid , a double stranded polyribonucleotide. after a  <dig> hr exposure to poly i:c., the fmr <dig> p:r ratio increased by 41% . this result indicates a possible positive feedback mechanism to stimulate fmrp synthesis in response to double stranded rna and it predicts that rnai activity will increase fmr <dig> translation in an ires-dependent manner. tempering this conclusion was that expression of endogenous fmrp did not change after a  <dig> hr exposure to poly i:c . as was observed from the kcl experiments, it is possible that fmrp expression may be upregulated at different timepoints following poly i:c exposure.

discussion
in the present report we demonstrate that the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains an ires whose activity is dependent upon the 5'  <dig> nt as well as the cgg repeats in the 5' leader. moreover, our studies indicate that internal initiation may be an important mechanism for the translation of the fmr <dig> mrna. this conclusion is supported by the observation that synthesis of fmrp is maintained when cap-dependent translation is inhibited by knocking-down eif-4e expression or rapamycin treatment. in addition, multiple stimuli differentially affect fmr <dig> ires activity suggesting that similar processes are dynamically regulating fmr <dig> translation in the cell.

our results show that the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains a cryptic promoter, an observation that has been noted in other 5' leaders  <cit> . the presence of elements influencing transcription is not surprising as transcriptional elements are located throughout a gene. while the fmr <dig> 5' leader affects transcription when present as dna, the same region promotes internal initiation as rna as deduced from both in vitro and ex vivo experiments using monocistronic and dicistronic mrna. rna for these assays was produced from in vitro transcription and this process could yield a fmr <dig> 5' leader with a secondary structure different than what occurs in the cell. indeed, it is likely that proteins including ires transactivating factors  bind to the fmr <dig> 5' leader and alter its structure in vivo. however, viral ireses whose activity depends extensively upon secondary structure yield robust ires activity from in vitro transcribed rna  <cit>  and are suitable for structural analysis  <cit> .

the cgg repeats, which are amplified in fxs, are evolutionarily conserved in mammals  <cit> . we suggest that the cgg repeats are retained due to their ability to promote translation and specifically internal initiation of translation. this hypothesis is supported by evidence indicating that mrna containing the normal number of cgg repeats translates at a higher level compared to mrna absent of the repeats or containing a higher number of repeats  <cit> . moreover, we found that deleting the cgg repeats significantly decreased fmr <dig> ires activity. the mechanism by which the repeats affect ires activity is open to speculation. secondary structure is important for viral ireses and their ability to recruit canonical factors and the ribosome  <cit> . minor changes in the rna structure can dramatically alter viral ires activity  <cit> . since the 3'  <dig> nt are able to mediate internal initiation, the ribosome must bind somewhere in this region and the cgg repeats may create a structure conducive for ribosomal recruitment. on the other hand, it has been proposed that expansion of the cgg repeats  in the fragile x pre-mutation allele sequesters an rna binding protein and indirectly affects the function of other mrnas  <cit> . thus, the cgg repeats may bind an itaf that directly recruits the translational machinery or may act as a molecular chaperone and alter the secondary structure, which in turn recruits the translational machinery.

deletion of the 5'  <dig> nt  of the fmr <dig> 5' leader yielded the largest decrease in ires activity. this segment is also very conserved in mammals. in general, viral ireses are greater than  <dig> nt in length and it would be of interest if a substantially smaller rna segment of the fmr <dig> 5' leader could internally initiate translation. this observation is not unprecedented as we have found that a region of  <dig> nt in the 5' leader of the amyloid precursor protein yields ires activity . however, the 5' deletion analysis as discussed above indicates that the ribosome binds further downstream. it is likely that the 5'  <dig> nt does not contain an ires, but acts as an enhancer by affecting downstream rna secondary structure, perhaps through protein binding. of interest is a region of ten contiguous nt  of which nine are pyrimidines making this a potential binding site for the polypyrimidine binding protein ptb) and its neural homolog nptb. ptb aside from its role in rna splicing is an important itaf for many eukaryotic ireses  <cit> .

fmrp is synthesized in response to neural activity  <cit>  and in particular, a brief exposure to kcl stimulates fmr <dig> synthesis in neuronal dendrites  <cit> . in our study, both internal initiation mediated by the fmr <dig> 5' leader and fmrp expression were also regulated by the duration of kcl exposure; a short exposure increased and a longer exposure decreased fmr <dig> ires activity and fmrp expression. moreover, intracellular acidification associated with decreased neural activity also inhibited fmr <dig> ires activity. these results suggest that neural activity of differing intensity or duration may produce distinct changes in ires-dependent translation mediated by the fmr <dig> 5' leader and that ires-dependent translation is a mechanism contributing to the synthesis of fmrp in neurons. these results also indicate that a feedback mechanism exists that is dependent upon the duration of the calcium influx through voltage gated calcium channels stimulated by kcl. indeed, extent and duration of intracellular calcium can regulate the translation of other mrnas  <cit> .

fmrp is associated with the risc complex  <cit>  and our results indicate that the presence of double stranded rna stimulates ires-dependent synthesis of fmrp. this result implicates a positive feedback mechanism regulating the synthesis of fmrp and the level of fmrp could regulate the activity or the targets of the risc complex. however, the overall level of fmrp was not altered after poly i:c exposure. poly i:c leads to phosphorylation of eif-2α  <cit>  and a subsequent decrease in cap-dependent translation  <cit> . it is possible that the loss of any cap-dependent translation of the fmr <dig> mrna is compensated by an increase in ires-dependent translation, but the global level of fmrp is unaffected.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrated that the fmr <dig> 5' leader contains an ires, whose critical elements include the cgg repeats as well as the 5' end of the leader. inhibiting cap-dependent translation in vitro and ex vivo resulted in only a small diminution in the translation of reporter mrnas containing the fmr <dig> 5' leader. under similar conditions, endogenous fmrp expression was maintained. multiple stimuli altered internal initiation of translation mediated by the fmr <dig> 5' leader that in some cases mirrors that of fmrp synthesis in vivo. taken together, our study indicates that ires-dependent translation of the fmr <dig> mrna may be a major contributor to the synthesis of fmrp in vivo.
