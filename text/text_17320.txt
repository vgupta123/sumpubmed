BACKGROUND
aerobic bacteria use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor in oxygen-containing environments for their metabolism. although aerobic growth has its obvious advantages , bacteria must deal with the undesired consequences from exposure to oxygen and oxidative environments. oxygen and its derivatives, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, are often highly reactive and pose a threat to many macromolecules, such as enzymes with iron-sulfur centers, nucleic acids, and lipids. therefore, bacteria undergoing aerobic growth must be able to sense, respond to, and detoxify reactive oxygen species , and maintain their structural and functional integrities.

the principle mechanism through which bacteria respond to environmental signals is through two-component and other regulatory systems  <cit> . at least four global regulatory systems -oxyrs, soxrs, fnr and arcab – are identified to respond to oxygen and its derivatives  <cit> . oxyrs and soxrs systems control the response of bacteria to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively  <cit> . fnr  controls the transition from aerobic growth to anaerobic growth  <cit> . fnr is believed to directly sense oxygen  <cit>  and regulate at least  <dig> operons  <cit> . in addition to fnr, the two-component regulatory system arcab also regulates the transition of bacteria from aerobic to anaerobic growth and is active under microaerobic conditions. it controls at least  <dig> operons that are involved in the tca cycle and energy metabolism  <cit> . the sensor kinase arcb undergoes auto-phosphorylation at his <dig> under anaerobic conditions, and this activation is negatively regulated by the oxidized quinones under aerobic conditions  <cit> . activated arcb undergoes a phosphorelay of his <dig> to asp <dig> to his <dig>  and subsequently activates its cognate transcriptional regulator arca by phosphorylating arca at asp <dig> to repress genes contributing to aerobic metabolism  and activates genes necessary for anaerobic metabolism   <cit> .

although the function of the arcab system in the anaerobic growth of e. coli has been well characterized, its function is unlikely to be limited to those required for the anaerobic growth of bacteria. for example, the arcab system has been reported to be involved in chromosomal replication, stress responses and aging of bacteria  <cit> . we have previously reported that arca of salmonella enterica is necessary for its resistance to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species   <cit> . more recently, arca is implicated in the ros stress response of haemophilus influenzae  <cit> . in this report, we analyzed the role of arcab in reactive oxygen resistance of e. coli and investigated the mechanism of ros resistance mediated by the arcab two-component system.

RESULTS
arcab system is necessary for e. coli to resist hydrogen peroxide 
to determine if the arcab global regulatory system plays a role in the survival of e. coli under stress by reactive oxygen species , we generated deletion mutants of arca  and arcb  in e. coli . both Δarca and Δarcb mutant e. coli formed smaller colonies than their parental e. coli, but otherwise showed similar colony morphology. the Δarca and Δarcb mutant e. coli were tested for their growth properties in complete  or minimal  medium with glucose as carbon source. overnight culture of each bacterial strain was diluted 1: <dig> in lb or m <dig> medium, and the growth of bacteria was measured by the optical density of the culture at  <dig> nm  every  <dig> hours for  <dig> hours and then at  <dig> hours. this incubation period includes both log phase of growth and stationary phase of bacteria. we found that od <dig> nm of both Δarca and Δarcb mutants appeared to be lower than that of the wild type e. coli during the log phase of growth. however, both mutants had similar bacterial concentrations and growth curves to those of the wild type e. coli when their growth was quantified by plating . therefore, no gross defect was observed in Δarca and Δarcb mutants in spite of lower od <dig> nm of their cultures. the anaerobic growth of the Δarca and Δarcb mutant e. coli was also tested and compared to that of the wild type e. coli. no defect was detected . similar results were obtained with lb broth and m <dig> minimal medium, results obtained with lb broth are shown .

kan, kanamycin resistance cassette; cm, chloramphenicol resistance cassette. sequences in bold in the table indicate those that are homologous to plasmids pkd <dig> and pkd <dig>  <cit> , which were used as pcr templates for mutagenesis.

we assayed the resistance of the Δarca mutant e. coli to hydrogen peroxide . overnight culture of the Δarca mutant e. coli was exposed to h2o <dig>  and its survival was compared to that of the wild type e. coli. the Δarca mutant e. coli was more susceptible than the wild type e. coli . plasmid prb3-arca, which carries a wild type allele of arca in plasmid prb3-273c  <cit> , complemented the survival defects in h2o <dig>  this indicates that the susceptible phenotype of the Δarca mutant e. coli was likely due to the deletion of the arca allele . assays performed with log-phase culture of the Δarca mutant e. coli yielded similar results . similar results were obtained with lb broth and m <dig> minimal medium, results obtained with lb broth are shown .

the same analysis was carried out for arcb, the cognate sensor-kinase of the arcab system. the Δarcb mutant e. coli survived less than the wild type parental strain . we had attempted to clone a wild type allele of arcb into plasmid prb3-273c to complement the Δarcb mutant e. coli. however, the cloning efficiency was unusually low as compared to similar cloning attempts we had conducted with the plasmid vector. of a total of  <dig> recombinant plasmids we eventually obtained from several transformations,  <dig> contained mutations at the start codon of arcb and the remaining  <dig> had mutations that produced truncations early in the orf . this indicates that an over-expression of arcb from a plasmid is probably toxic to e. coli. as an alternative, we constructed a revertant of the Δarcb mutant e. coli, in which a wild type arcb allele replaced the deleted arcb allele . the revertant mutant of Δarcb was shown to have the same resistance to h2o <dig> as the wild type e. coli .

the arcab system is dispensable for h2o <dig> scavenge
to determine the mechanism of how the arcab system is involved in h2o <dig> resistance, we analyzed the h2o <dig> scavenging activity of the Δarca and Δarcb mutant of e. coli k <dig>  since a defect in h2o <dig> scavenging activity may lead to the susceptibility to h2o <dig>  the overnight culture was diluted in lb containing  <dig> mm of h2o <dig>  and the concentration of the residual h2o <dig> was measured after various incubation period. the scavenge of h2o <dig> was measured as the reduction in h2o <dig> concentration over the incubation period. our results indicate that both Δarca and Δarcb mutants scavenged h2o <dig> normally as compared to the wild type e. coli k <dig> , and no deficiency was observed .

phosphorylation at asp <dig> is dispensable for h2o <dig> resistance mediated by arca
under anaerobic conditions, arcb is activated by reduced quinones, undergoes auto-phosphorylation, and transfers its phosphorylation to arca  <cit> . it is not known if arca is phosphorylated under aerobic conditions or if unphosphorylated arca has any function. to test if phosphorylation is necessary for h2o <dig> resistance mediated by arca, we generated an asp <dig> → ala mutation in arca in plasmid prb3-arca  <cit>  and used the resulting plasmid prb3-arcd2a to complement the Δarca mutant e. coli. in h2o <dig> resistance assays, plasmid prb3-arcd2a rescued the Δarca mutant e. coli and the resistance of the mutant to h2o <dig> was restored to the wild type level . however, unlike the original plasmid prb3-arca, plasmid prb3-arcd2a did not render the complemented Δarca mutant e. coli more resistant to h2o <dig> than the wild type e. coli .

response of flagellin, oppa and glti to h2o <dig> is altered in the Δarca mutant e. coli
to investigate the mechanisms of h2o <dig> resistance mediated by arca, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to examine the protein profiles in the Δarca mutant e. coli in the presence or absence of h2o <dig>  and compared to those of the wild type e. coli. while most proteins either were not altered by h2o <dig> treatment, or responded similarly to h2o <dig> treatment in the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli, the levels of three proteins were observed to respond to h2o <dig> differently, the most abundant of which is shown in figure  <dig>  by peptide mass fingerprinting using maldi-tof, the prominent protein in figure  <dig> was identified as flagellin encoded by flic, while the other two less abundant proteins were identified as oligopeptide abc transporter substrate-binding protein  and glutamate and aspartate transporter subunit  . the levels of these proteins were quantified in the h2o2-treated and control untreated samples of the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli .

the level of each protein in the untreated wild type e. coli is arbitrarily set as  <dig>  and levels of proteins in other samples are expressed as relative to the level in the untreated e. coli. results are the average of three to five independent experiments  with standard deviation. † level differs significantly from that of untreated wild type e. coli; and § level differs significantly from that of wild type e. coli treated with h2o <dig> .

flagellin is the only one among the  <dig> most abundant proteins that responded to h2o <dig> treatment. in the wild type, un-treated e. coli flagellin was detected at a lower level than in the Δarca mutant e. coli, and h2o <dig> treatment further decreased the flagellin level . in the Δarca mutant e. coli h2o <dig> treatment also decreased flagellin level, however, the decrease was not statistically significant . therefore, compared to the wild type the e. coli, Δarca mutant displayed higher flagellin levels both constitutively and following h2o <dig> treatment, and its flagellin level did not respond to h2o <dig> treatment as that in the wild type e. coli.

the response of oppa and glti expression was different from that of flagellin. in the untreated bacteria levels of both glti and oppa appeared to be higher in the Δarca mutant than in the wild type e. coli . following h2o <dig> treatment the levels of oppa and glti in the wild type e. coli became higher , while neither protein displayed a statistically significant change in the Δarca mutant e. coli . this results in a lower glti and oppa level in the h2o <dig> treated Δarca mutant than the wild type e. coli.

flagellin messenger rna is over-expressed in the Δarca mutant e. coli
since flagellin was one of the most abundant proteins in e. coli and the only abundant protein whose level was altered in response to h2o <dig>  we decided to investigate the influence of flagellin on the survival of the Δarca mutant e. coli in the presence of h2o <dig>  to determine if the higher protein levels of flagellin in the Δarca mutant e. coli was due to higher levels of mrna, we examined the expression of the flic transcripts by real-time reverse transcriptase pcr analysis . rna was prepared from the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli before and after exposure to h2o <dig>  and subjected to rt-pcr analysis. similar to protein levels, the Δarca mutant e. coli had higher levels of flic mrna than the wild type e. coli both constitutively and after exposure to h2o <dig>  in both strains, h2o2exposure reduced the flic mrna level progressively . the difference in flic mrna levels between the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli decreased with longer exposure periods and no difference could be detected by  <dig> minutes of exposure . to determine if arca directly regulates flic expression, we expressed and purified recombinant arca from aerobic cultures of e. coli and carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assay of the flic upstream sequence. no specific binding was detected .

deletion of flagellin increased the survival of the Δarca mutant e. coli
flagellin is one of the most abundant proteins in e. coli, and we have shown that its level was higher in the Δarca mutant e. coli both constitutively and upon h2o <dig> exposure . we reasoned that expressing an abundant protein such as flagellin at a higher level might be a burden to the Δarca mutant e. coli, especially under stress conditions such as those caused by h2o <dig>  we hypothesize that a deletion of flagellin encoded by flic may facilitate the survival of the Δarca mutant e. coli exposed to h2o <dig>  to test this hypothesis, we generated a non-polar Δflic mutant and an Δarca/Δflic double mutant e. coli. the non-polar deletion of flic itself had no obvious effect on the survival of e. coli in the presence of h2o <dig> . however, the flic deletion improved the survival of the Δarca mutant e. coli, and the survival of the Δarca/Δflic double mutant e. coli was close to that of the wild type e. coli . this indicates that elimination of flagellin in the Δarca mutant e. coli enhanced its survival under h2o <dig> stress.

in addition to flagellin, we have also attempted to delete other abundant proteins to determine if such deletions would improve the survival of the arca mutant e. coli. our efforts were not successful, however, because most abundant proteins such as elongation factors,  <dig> s ribosomal proteins, and chaperone proteins are either essential or important for e. coli, and such deletions would be detrimental to e. coli. we successfully deleted d-ribose periplasmic binding protein  encoded by rbsb, a protein which is as abundant as or more abundant than flagellin. the Δrbsb mutant itself was found to be susceptible to h2o <dig>  therefore could not be used to test the effect of rbsb on the h2o <dig> resistance of the arca mutant e. coli .

amino acid supplementation improved the survival of the Δarca mutant e. coli under h2o <dig> stress
we described above that a deletion of flagellin in e. coli improved the survival of the Δarca mutant e. coli in the presence of h2o <dig>  our analysis of the proteome of the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli indicated that levels of glutamine/aspartate periplasmic binding protein  and oligopeptide binding protein precursor  increased in the Δarca mutant as compared to the wild type e. coli . in addition, the Δarca mutant e. coli failed to increase glti and oppa protein levels in response to h2o <dig> as the wild type e. coli. this suggests that e. coli may have an increased need for amino acids under h2o <dig> stress and the Δarca mutant e. coli may benefit from amino acid supplementation. to test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of amino acid supplementation on the survival of the Δarca mutant e. coli in the presence of h2o <dig>  to facilitate a direct comparison between the resistance of the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli to h2o <dig> with or without amino acid supplementation, we carried out a disc diffusion assay, and bacterial resistance to h2o <dig> was measured by the diameter of the zone of inhibition . without amino acid supplementation the zoi of the Δarca mutant e. coli was significantly larger than that of the wild type e. coli . with amino acid supplementation, sizes of the zoi reduced for both the wild type and the Δarca mutant e. coli, and the difference in the sizes of the zoi between wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli diminished with amino acid supplementation . we tested single amino acids and combinations of various amino acids, and none of the combinations tested was able to complement the susceptibility of the Δarca mutant e. coli as the total amino acids .

antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis increased susceptibility of e. coli to h2o2
to test if protein synthesis is important for bacterial survival and if protein synthesis inhibition is detrimental to bacteria under reactive oxygen stress, we assayed the resistance of e. coli to h2o <dig> in the presence of chloramphenicol, an antibiotic that inhibits peptide bond formation and hence protein synthesis. without h2o <dig> or antibiotic, wild type e. coli grew approximately 2log <dig> during  <dig> hours of incubation . hydrogen peroxide was bactericidal and the bacterial concentration decreased for over 1log <dig> . supplementation of chloramphenicol alone prohibited bacterial proliferation and the bacterial concentration decreased slightly . incubation in the presence of both h2o <dig> and chloramphenicol was more detrimental to e. coli than either h2o <dig> or chloramphenicol alone, and the bacterial concentration decreased by nearly 4log <dig> . this indicates that chloramphenicol enhanced the bactericidal activity of h2o <dig>  to determine if this enhanced bactericidal activity is due to the bacteriostatic activity of chloramphenicol, we tested the effect of ampicillin, an antibiotic that inhibits the bacterial cell wall synthesis, in the same assay. when added alone, ampicillin had similar effect on bacterial growth as chloramphenicol did . however, in contrast to chloramphenicol that enhanced the bactericidal effect of h2o <dig> , the addition of ampicillin reduced the bactericidal activity of h2o <dig> for unknown reasons . this indicates that the synergistic effect of chloramphenicol on the bactericidal activity of h2o <dig> is not due to its bacteriostatic effect and suggests that protein synthesis is important for e. coli to resist the killing by h2o <dig> 

similar assays were carried out with the Δarca mutant e. coli and the results were consistent with those of the wild type e. coli. while incubation with h2o <dig> alone reduced the concentration of the Δarca mutant e. coli by over 5log <dig> after  <dig> hours of incubation , the addition of chloramphenicol to the assay eliminated all e. coli . the synergistic effect of the bactericidal activity of h2o <dig> and chloramphenicol on the Δarca mutant e. coli is not because it is more susceptible to chloramphenicol . similarly to that observed with wild type e. coli, ampicillin reduced the bactericidal activity of h2o <dig>  and the Δarca mutant e. coli survived better in the presence of both ampicillin and h2o <dig> than h2o <dig> alone  .

discussion
although the arcab system has been extensively investigated for its role as the global control system of e. coli in anaerobic growth, its role, if any, in aerobic growth is much less understood. we have previously reported that arca is necessary for the pathogenic bacterium salmonella enterica to resist reactive oxygen and nitrogen species under aerobic conditions  <cit> . in this report, we used e. coli as our model to further explore the role of both arca and arcb in ros resistance, and to investigate the mechanism of ros resistance mediated by the arcab two-component system. here we demonstrate that deletion mutants of arca and arcb were more susceptible to h2o <dig>  suggesting that both arca and arcb were necessary for e. coli to resist the stress caused by h2o <dig> , and that their functions were not limited to anaerobic growth of bacteria. interestingly, we have not detected any growth defects of Δarca or Δarcb mutant e. coli under anaerobic conditions  and to our knowledge no such defect has been reported in the literature. in addition, an Δarca mutant of salmonella enterica grew normally in anaerobic medium  <cit> . this further indicates that arcab has wider roles in the physiology and metabolism of enteric bacteria besides its well-characterized regulation of anaerobic growth of bacteria.

the signaling pathway of the arcab system under anaerobic conditions has been extensively characterized  <cit> . the membrane-bound sensor-kinase arcb is activated by reduced quinones under anaerobic conditions, and subsequently activates its cognate transcriptional regulator arca by phosphorylating arca at asp <dig>  <cit> . matsushika and mizuno previously reported that arcb can also phosphorylate arca directly through his <dig> under aerobic conditions  <cit> , however, its physiological relevance to e. coli has not been reported. our results on the role of arcab in ros resistance suggest that arcab can be activated by novel signals other than reduced quinones and anaerobic conditions, and the activation is independent of phosphorylation at asp <dig> of arca as demonstrated under anaerobic conditions  <cit> , since phosphorylation-defective arca expressed from a plasmid fully complemented an Δarca mutant e. coli for its susceptibility to h2o <dig> . we would like to point out that our analysis was conducted using a phosphorylation-mutant arca  expressed from a plasmid. it is yet to be determined if a mutant carrying a corresponding mutation of arca in the chromosome is susceptible to h2o <dig>   we have also noticed that the wild type arca expressed from a plasmid confers a stronger h2o <dig> resistance phenotype than the phosphorylation-defective arca. the Δarca mutant e. coli complemented in trans with a wild type arca allele demonstrated higher h2o <dig> resistance than the wild type e. coli , while the same mutant e. coli complemented with a phosphorylation-defective arca allele has the same h2o <dig> resistance as the wild type e. coli .

in addition to novel signals and signaling pathways that may mediate the function of the arcab system in the ros resistance, the arcab system may also regulate a distinct set of genes under aerobic conditions. under anaerobic conditions arca mostly negatively regulates genes involved in the tca cycle and electron transport  <cit> . under aerobic conditions, a microarray study by oshima et al. demonstrated that expression of a large number of genes in the Δarca or Δarcb mutant e. coli was altered  <cit> . our results suggest that levels of at least three proteins  were altered in the Δarca mutant e. coli both constitutively and in response to h2o <dig> treatment . our further analysis on the messenger rna level of flic indicates that the rna levels are higher in the Δarca mutant e. coli and corresponded to the protein levels, suggesting that the regulation is likely on the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level . oshima et al. did not detect a significant alteration in the expression of flic in their microarray analysis, although flagellar synthesis was identified as a system that was affected in the Δarca mutant but not the Δarcb mutant e. coli  <cit> . the discrepancy is possibly due to the differences in experimental conditions  and detection methods . since we detected an elevation of both mrna and protein levels of flagellin in the Δarca mutant e. coli , we believe that our observation is valid. the regulation of arca on flagellin is likely to be indirect, as we did not detect specific binding of recombinant arca protein to the upstream sequence of flic .

given that the arcab system regulates a large number of genes in e. coli, its role in the ros resistance is likely to be complex. we have demonstrated that mutation of arca or arcb did not alter the h2o <dig> scavenging ability of e. coli , however, the precise molecular mechanism on how arca regulates ros resistance in e. coli is yet to be elucidated. arca was reported to be necessary for the ros resistance of haemophilus influenzae due to its regulation of dps, a ferritin-like small protein that was previously reported to be involved in ros resistance of salmonella  <cit> . the mechanism of the ros resistance mediated by arca is likely to be different in e. coli, since dps is expressed close to the wild type level in the Δarca or Δarcb mutant , and our preliminary microarray analysis with salmonella Δarca mutant indicated that dps responded normally to h2o <dig> in the Δarca mutant . one possible clue on the mechanism of how arcab contributes to the ros resistance of e. coli came from our proteomic analysis that showed altered expression of flagellin, glti and oppa between the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli . the constitutive glti and oppa levels are higher in the Δarca mutant than in the wild type e. coli, suggesting that the mutant may have a higher need for amino acid transport. in contrast to the glti and oppa levels in the wild type e. coli that increased 6- and 24-fold respectively in response to h2o <dig> exposure , the level of neither protein in the Δarca mutant increased under the same condition . a higher level of flagellin in the Δarca mutant likely put further constraint on the protein synthesis, and as a result the Δarca mutant e. coli might have become less fit under h2o <dig> stress. our genetic study demonstrating that deletion of flic "rescued" the survival defect of the Δarca mutant e. coli under h2o <dig> stress  supports the hypothesis.

ros stress conditions induce growth arrest in e. coli. chang et al. has reported that in growth arrest induced by either glucose-lactose diauxie, entry into stationary phase, or h2o <dig> treatment, genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis pathways are down-regulated except those of histidine and arginine biosynthesis  <cit> . recently, jang and imlay have shown that h2o <dig> damages enzymes with iron-sulfur and impairs bacterial metabolism, especially the biosynthesis of leucine  <cit> . this down regulation of amino acid synthesis may cause a strain on the protein synthesis of bacteria. our results indicate that protein synthesis is important for e. coli to survive h2o <dig> treatment. chloramphenicol, an antibiotic inhibiting protein synthesis, reduced the survival of both the wild type and Δarca mutant e. coli after h2o <dig> treatment, while ampicillin did not . consistently, amino acid supplementation enhanced the survival of e. coli after h2o <dig> treatment . this is in agreement with the report by calioz and touati that amino acid supplementation facilitates the survival of superoxide dismutase-deficient e. coli under aerobic conditions  <cit> .

although our results and results from other investigators suggest that protein synthesis and amino acid availability are important for e. coli to survive ros stress and the global regulatory system arcab plays a role this aspect of ros stress resistance, protein synthesis and amino acid availability may be only one aspect of the pleiotropic effect of arcab system on e. coli, since chloramphenicol-treated Δarca mutant was still more susceptible than the similarly treated wild type e. coli. further studies are necessary to elucidate more molecular mechanisms that control the ros resistance mediated by the arcab global regulatory system.

CONCLUSIONS
the global regulatory system arcab of e. coli regulate many important functions of bacteria including anaerobic growth, motility, and cell division. here we demonstrate that arcab regulates ros resistance under aerobic condition, and the signalling pathway of this regulation is distinct from that under anaerobic conditions. the arcab system may regulate protein and amino acid synthesis and transport that influence the fitness of e. coli under ros stress.
