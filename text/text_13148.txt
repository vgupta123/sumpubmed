BACKGROUND
the recent paradigm shift in molecular and systems biology to characterization of large sets of genes and proteins has been enabled by continual technological innovations, including fast sequencing technologies  <cit> , arrays for measuring gene expression patterns  <cit> , and high throughput screens that identify various types of molecular interactions  <cit> . data sets produced by these new technologies have also spurred development of computational tools to assist in their analysis  <cit> . of particular importance is function assignment to genes in a genome or any system of interest, as functional information is indispensable for both biological interpretation of the behavior of the system and generation of hypotheses for designing subsequent experiments  <cit> . to this end, many function prediction methods have been developed recently to meet the urgent needs  <cit> . they include those which employ information from sequence database search  <cit>  more thoroughly than conventional homology searches  <cit> , those which use protein tertiary structure information  <cit> , methods that consider conservation of gene locations in genome sequences  <cit> , and methods which utilize protein-protein interaction  data  <cit> . please refer to recent reviews for thorough discussion of recent function prediction methods  <cit> .

we previously introduced pfp as a method for predicting gene ontology  functional terms  <cit>  for individual protein sequences with empirically derived confidence scores  <cit> . pfp has been shown to outperform other sequence-based methods  <cit>  and has been enormously successful in international assessments of methods for function prediction . in the previous studies, we have demonstrated that pfp is superior to the other methods not only in terms of the accuracy of function assignment but also in its larger coverage for genome-scale annotation  <cit> .

here, we examine the utility of applying pfp predictions to genomes of three organisms, escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae , and plasmodium falciparum . the malaria genome is used as an example of a poorly annotated organism for which new annotation provides extensive interesting and useful functional knowledge. taking advantage of pfp's larger function annotation coverage, more than 90% of proteins encoded in each genome are annotated. in order to investigate the structure of the functional space occupied by each proteome, we represented the mutual functional similarity of proteins in a form of network named the functional similarity network. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind introduced to investigate the structure of protein function space. weston et al. proposed to consider the pairwise sequence similarity of many proteins in a database, which is named the protein similarity network, to improve the database search accuracy  <cit> . however, the focus of their work is to improve the database search accuracy but not the investigation of the network property of the protein similarity. four different functional similarity networks are generated by using the function annotation in the three go categories, namely, biological process , cellular component , molecular function , and also by using the funsim score, which evaluates the overall functional similarity among the three go categories. funsim uses the hierarchical structure of go and information content of common ancestors of predicted and actual terms  <cit> . analyses of the network properties of the functional similarity networks in comparison with the ppi networks  revealed interesting characteristics: first, most of the functional similarity networks as well as the ppi networks are scale-free, following the power-law distribution. however, the functional similarity networks are distinct from the ppi networks by their modularity as indicated by the average clustering coefficient. moreover, the funsim network distinguishes itself from the single go-score networks by showing a higher clustering degree exponent value and thus exhibiting a higher tendency to be hierarchical, although the clustering degree exponent value seems to be sensitive to the similarity threshold value used to construct the funsim score network. interestingly, the hierarchy of the biological network was first observed in metabolic pathway networks  <cit> . this might imply that the funsim score of the three organisms studied somewhat captures the structure of relationships between proteins in pathways. additionally, we analyze functional similarity of proteins in sub networks in ppi networks and local regions of the genomes. we present several interesting and potentially useful individual cases from each of the analysis, and provide extensive supplementary data for all of the methods discussed.

RESULTS
enrichment of function annotation by pfp
we have previously shown that pfp can make more accurate function prediction than existing methods and also it can significantly increase the coverage of the function assignment to a genome  <cit> . the summary of function assignments to the three genomes used in this study, escherichia coli k- <dig>  s. cerevisiae, and p. falciparum, is shown in table  <dig>  pfp provides high confidence function prediction  to a significant number of genes with unknown function even to the two very well annotated genomes, e. coli and yeast. as for the malaria genome, which is less well annotated, the number of genes with annotation is doubled by pfp's function prediction. consequently, more than 90% of genes in all the three genomes have function information.

in the parentheses, the percentage of the genes relative to the total number of genes in the genome is shown.

a) the number of genes with function annotation in the goa database.

functional similarity network by pfp
the previous section shows that pfp significantly enriches the function annotation in the three genomes, which facilitates analysis of the whole landscape of the functional space occupied by the genomes. in this work, we represent the functional similarity of genes in a genome as a network which is named the functional similarity network . in the functional similarity network, nodes represent proteins with function assignment and edges between proteins denote functional similarity between them. for each genome, four networks are constructed by considering the similarity scores in the three individual go categories, i.e., bp-score, cc-score, and mf-score separately , and the funsim score . figure  <dig> visualizes functional similarity networks in which protein pairs with a similarity score of  <dig>  or higher are connected by edges. we also analyze networks with two different threshold values of the similarity score,  <dig>  and  <dig> . these networks intuitively represent overall functional space of proteins in a genome. the structure of the functional similarity networks changes as different threshold values are used. obviously, the number of edges in a functional similarity network increases and the network becomes denser as a smaller threshold value is used for connecting edges. table  <dig> shows the number of edges for the functional similarity networks using three threshold values,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . here we first discuss the functional similarity networks using the threshold value of  <dig>   and later analyze how the network properties change by using different threshold values. in table  <dig>  the parameters of the functional similarity networks for a threshold of  <dig>  are underlined.

c) the average clustering coefficient c relative to the degree k is fit to the clustering-degree function, c ~k-β. for the ppi, the data with k ≥  <dig>  while data with k ≥  <dig>  k ≥  <dig>  and k ≥  <dig> are used for the functional similarity networks with the similarity score threshold value of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

the functional similarity network using the  <dig>  for the similarity threshold value
in all of the functional similarity networks , a majority of the proteins are included in the largest connected component, which holds  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of the proteins. the degree distribution of the networks, i.e. the fraction of proteins, p, with a given number of connections, k,  shows that most of them, except for a couple of networks, follow the power-law, p ~ k-γ  <cit> . the degree exponent γ ranges from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , which indicates that there are a small number of "hub" proteins with functional similarity to many other proteins . the degree exponent values  of the functional similarity networks of the bp-, cc-, and mf-score are smaller than those of the ppi networks shown in figure  <dig>  which means that the go-score networks have larger clusters  and less proteins with a small degree than the ppi networks. moreover, small r <dig> value of the cc-score networks  indicates that they do not fit well to the power-law. this is visually evident, for example, in the cc-score network of e. coli and the mf-score network of malaria . the funsim networks have smaller dominant hub proteins than the bp-, cc-, and mf-score networks as shown by their larger γ values . this is natural as a hub protein in the funsim network needs to have similarity in all of the bp-, cc-, and mf-score with neighboring proteins and thus tends to have fewer edges.

the middle rows in table  <dig> show the clustering coefficients for the networks computed as per the description in methods section. we found that the ppi and the functional similarity networks are clearly distinguished by the clustering coefficient with the latter having larger modularity . single go-score networks have larger modularity as compared with the funsim networks. the malaria cc-score network has the largest clustering coefficient value , which is also evident from how it looks . the funsim networks have slightly lower modularity than the single go-score networks for the same reason that they have fewer hub proteins, i.e. the edges need to satisfy the more severer condition of functional similarity.

we further investigated the fit of the networks to the hierarchical model proposed by ravasz et al.  <cit> . the hierarchy in their model is quantitatively characterized by comparison of the clustering coefficient of a node with k links to the scaling law, c ~ k- <dig>  the last rows in table  <dig> show the clustering degree exponent  ~ k-β) of each network. consistent with previous studies  <cit> , the ppi networks of e. coli and yeast show hierarchy, indicated by a β value close to  <dig>  . it is rather interesting to notice that the ppi network of malaria does not show the hierarchy. the apparent dissimilar behavior of the malaria ppi network might be due to the smaller coverage of the proteins in its ppi network. compared to the e. coli and yeast ppi networks which include more than 55% of total known proteins, the malaria ppi network covers only  <dig> % of its proteins. the individual go-score networks show less dependency of the c value to the degree k and thus do not exhibit hierarchy as shown by their small clustering degree exponent values. however, the clustering coefficient of the funsim network is well approximated by c ~ k- <dig> . it is an interesting observation that hierarchy of the network arises for the funsim score that integrates single go-scores, which do not show hierarchy individually. it might imply that the funsim score somewhat captures properties of the metabolic networks. although both the ppi and the funsim network show hierarchy, they are different in the range of the clustering coefficient values , with the latter having larger values.

effect of changing the similarity threshold value for connecting edges
in addition to the networks with the similarity threshold value of  <dig>  which are discussed above, we examine the networks using a smaller threshold value,  <dig> , and a higher threshold value,  <dig>  to understand how the network structure changes. the total number of edges significantly increases by using a more permissive threshold value  for connecting edges and decreases with a larger threshold value  . as the networks become denser with more edges , the number of highly connected nodes increases, which reflects to the decrease in the degree component . this trend is evident especially for the cc-score networks, for which the degree component values are too small for them to be power-law networks. the funsim networks of the three organisms constantly have high degree exponent values. the average clustering coefficient values  are relatively less affected by the change of the similarity threshold values for drawing edges. thus all networks with all three similarity threshold values examined are modular.

looking at the clustering degree exponent values, β, , none of the single-go score networks exhibits significant hierarchy  by changing the similarity threshold value. the funsim networks of malaria consistently show hierarchy for all the similarity threshold values. the β value for the e. coli funsim networks drops to around  <dig>  by changing the similarity threshold value from  <dig>  to a smaller  and also to a larger  value. in the case of yeast funsim network, lowering the similarity threshold value still keeps a high β value but raising the threshold value to  <dig>  drops it to  <dig> . thus, referring to the originally proposed scaling law for the hierarchical network  <cit> , which has the β value of  <dig> , e. coli funsim networks with the similarity threshold value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as the yeast funsim network with the similarity threshold value of  <dig>  may not be fully qualified as hierarchical. however, as figure  <dig> and table  <dig> show, the funsim networks have a higher β value, and thus tend to be more hierarchical than the single go-score networks.

to summarize, both ppi and most of the newly described functional similarity networks are scale-free. the ppi network and functional similarity networks  are distinguished by their modularity, with the latter networks showing significant modularity with high clustering coefficient values while the ppi does not. lastly, the funsim network is different from the single go-score networks by exhibiting a higher tendency to be hierarchical . however, note that the β value of funsim networks seem to be sensitive to the similarity threshold value and e. coli and yeast funsim networks drop their β value to less than  <dig>  when the similarity threshold value is changed to  <dig>  and  <dig> .

annotating ppi subnetworks
next, we examine subnetworks in the ppi networks to see how many edges in them are present in the functional similarity networks. here, the functional similarity networks with the similarity threshold value of  <dig>  are used. we compare the number of edges in subnetworks connecting nodes with common annotations assigned in the goa database and edges with nodes with common predictions by pfp . edges with common annotations for both nodes did not increase much in e. coli and yeast by pfp's prediction. particularly, there is no increase in the number of edges with common annotations in yeast. this is because yeast ppi networks have been already well annotated as shown in figure  <dig>  in contrast,  <dig> out of  <dig> subnetworks of malaria are enriched by the pfp prediction. the number of edges with common annotations increased four times  in malaria.

a) edges connecting two nodes with  common go annotation in the goa database. in the parentheses, the fraction of the edges relative to the total number of edges is shown.

b) edges connecting two nodes with  common annotation in the goa database or common go term prediction by pfp.

c) edges connecting two nodes with common go term prediction by pfp.

d) subnetworks where the number of edges with common annotation increased by considering pfp prediction.

since malaria has the largest annotation enrichment among the three organisms , below we focus on annotations given to the malaria ppi network. following a previous work  <cit> , we examine annotation given to subnetworks of the ppi. a subnetwork is identified as all proteins connected to a common centroid protein and the edges among them. the statistical significance of the number of edges in a subnetwork is tested by computing the connectivity coefficient  compared with  <dig> randomized networks. those subnetworks with a p-value of below  <dig>  by the t-test  are identified as targets for discussion. we identified  <dig> subnetworks which hold  <dig>  of the proteins in the entire ppi network.

each target subnetwork is tested for overrepresentation of go terms using only previously known annotations and then using known and predicted terms by pfp. the false discovery rate  correction of the hypergeometric distribution  is used to evaluate the statistical significance of overrepresented go terms in a subnetwork. for malaria, we found six subnetworks in which no functional terms were overrepresented in the original annotation in the goa database. to these we assigned  <dig> new annotations. in  <dig> other subnetworks we were able to identify a total of  <dig>  new overrepresented go terms, with an average annotation gain of 591%. to evaluate the consistency of newly predicted annotations with previously known annotations, we used the funsim score  to compare all of the terms within each subnetwork. it is a general assumption that interacting proteins are involved in the same or coordinating biological pathways and coexist in the same locations within the cell  <cit> . for malaria, newly predicted functional terms had a positive effect on the majority of the subnetworks as shown in the histograms . on an average, bp-score, cc-score, mf-score, and funsim score similarity increased by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. thus, not only does the addition of predicted terms effect in an increase in the functional information available for annotating a subnetwork, but it also tends to refine the overall annotation for that subnetwork.

below we present six individual cases of interesting new annotations to subnetworks in p. falciparum. the previous and new annotations for each of these examples are provided in table  <dig>  and visual representations of the analyzed subnetworks are provided in figure  <dig>  the subnetwork centered by the protein q8i1q <dig>  contains  <dig> proteins,  <dig> of which are newly annotated by pfp prediction. among the six previously annotated proteins, representative functionality by our analysis deals with chromosome/chromatin packing. when new high-confidence predicted annotations are considered, some new functional terms arise as statistically overrepresented in the subnetwork. these include several functions relating to the cytoskeleton  and nuclear-directed transport. the theme of these new annotations tends to suggest that interactions among this group of proteins may reveal a transport mechanism, potentially for moving proteins involved in chromosome packaging into the nucleus. next, protein q8i <dig> centers a subnetwork of proteins which we were unable to characterize using only known annotations . nine of the  <dig> proteins are annotated with high-confidence predictions, revealing two related groups of functional terms as potential representatives of the overall function of the subnetwork. the first of these groups is related to nucleic acid binding and transport and localization, and the second is related to carbohydrate metabolism.

a) the p-value is computed by eqn.  <dig> 

the next two examples are potentially more interesting, especially with regard to the known pathogenicity of the malaria plasmodium. the group of  <dig> proteins centered on q8i <dig> was previously annotated with terms directly related to pathogenesis  . after providing predicted annotations for  <dig> of those  <dig> proteins, several other functions that may be related to particular pathogenic mechanisms were revealed. particularly interesting are the terms "translation regulator activity", "negative regulation of lymphocyte activation", "microtubule cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis", and "peroxisome degradation". although the proteins in this subnetwork could already be associated with pathogenesis, new predicted annotations for uncharacterized proteins add direction for designing experiments to test for specific mechanisms that may be responsible for the pathogenic behavior. the interaction subnetwork around malaria protein q8i <dig>  also has some potential interest in the molecular mechanisms that contribute to apoptosis. again, over half of the included proteins  were initially uncharacterized but could be assigned high confidence pfp predictions. before taking new predictions into account, the cluster was annotated as being related to "cellular protein metabolism" and "protein folding". several more interesting and specific functional terms were brought to light after including predictions. these terms are related to the cytoskeleton and protein/rna transport and localization. specifically, the terms "anterior/posterior pattern formation", "rna localization", and "cell death" are closely related and signify that the protein interactions in this subnetwork are likely to be involved in the programmed re-organization of the cell leading to death, or apoptosis.

identifying clusters of functionally related protein-coding genes in genomes
genome proximity is known to be related to conservation of protein function, most notably in the cases of coordinately regulated groups of protein-coding genes in operons or regulons  <cit>  and among some membrane transport proteins  <cit> . similarity of phylogenetic profiles  <cit>  and stability of local genome organization between species  <cit>  have also revealed functional conservation among groups of genes. here we scanned the three genomes using a window of a certain size  to identify groups of neighboring genes with significant function similarity. windows of genes that have an overall categorical similarity  of greater than  <dig>  or a comprehensive similarity  of greater than  <dig> , including new functional terms predicted by pfp, were considered for analysis. the threshold values,  <dig>  and  <dig> , are chosen to roughly match the number of windows to be selected with the number of known regulons in e. coli. according to the regulondb database   <cit> , there are  <dig> regulons in the e.coli genome. using  <dig>  in mf, bp, and cc score selects  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, and  <dig>  in the funsim score selects  <dig>  windows . for example, the windows with regulons of ribosomal subunits , flagellar proteins , his operon , and psp operon , satisfy these threshold values. figure  <dig> illustrates the functional similarity scores along the e. coli genome. some of the known operons are marked in color.

as with the ppi subnetworks, each genome window identified as a target was tested for overrepresentation of go functional terms using only previously known annotations and then using known and predicted terms by pfp using the hypergeometric distribution . the percent difference between these two scenarios is used as our standard measure of annotation gain. the summary of the increase of the annotation to the genome windows is shown in table  <dig>  again, as was the case with annotation of ppi subnetworks, we would expect to find that applying predicted terms to groups of proteins in e. coli and yeast would yield some, but not an extensive, degree of annotation gain. this indeed turned out to be true. for e. coli and yeast, we were able to annotate  <dig> and  <dig> previously unannotated windows, respectively, in each genome. the average annotation gain computed for previously annotated windows are 49% and 14% for e. coli and yeast, respectively. analysis of annotation gain among windows in the malaria genome again yielded significantly higher increases. 37%  of windows with no previously known functional annotation were assigned with predicted go terms by pfp. the remaining  <dig>  windows for which some annotation already existed, we observed an average annotation gain of 289% .

a) these numbers include windows with genes on the plus strand, those with genes on the minus strand, and those with genes from the both strands.

b) the number of windows which include only unannotated genes in the goa database.

c) only overrepresented go terms are considered.

d) the number of windows which all the included genes are unannotated in the goa database.

a) the direction of the dna strands on which the genes are located.

b) the p-value of the overrepresentation of the go term in the genes in the window

here, we also present several individual cases of new annotation to regions in the genomes of each of the three organisms. a summary of the new annotation is shown in table  <dig>  the  <dig> kb region of malaria chromosome  <dig> starting at position  <dig>  contains six proteins with an average go biological process similarity of  <dig> . the  <dig> kb region of malaria chromosome  <dig> starting at position  <dig>  contains six proteins with an average go biological process similarity of  <dig> . after annotating four of the five previously uncharacterized proteins coded here with high confidence predictions, we found that the proteins may share involvement in phosphorylation or dephosphorylation . this may indicate that these neighboring proteins are involved in a common signaling or metabolic pathway. similarly, the region of malaria chromosome  <dig> starting at position  <dig> , <dig>  was assigned several receptor-like activities. the overrepresented terms related to several types of receptor activity give a strong indication that this region contains proteins that form complex or interact closely as part of a membrane signaling receptor. membrane receptors and complexes of membrane proteins are well characterized as sharing genome proximity  <cit> . the four proteins between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the minus strand of malaria chromosome  <dig>  were assigned several functional terms that all relate to the intrinsic cellular response to nutrients. the terms "intracellular transport", "response to nutrients", "negative regulation of transcription by carbon catabolites", and "mitotic cell cycle" could all indicate a common process involving metabolism and cellular signaling response to the presence of nutrients under particular conditions, perhaps akin to the well known lac operon in e. coli.

e. coli is one of the most well-characterized model organisms in terms of coordinately regulated expression in the form of operons and regulons  <cit> . as such, we would not expect to find many regions of the genome that could represent new examples of these molecular phenomena relating to specific pathways. however, we did find several examples including the following two where annotation of previously uncharacterized regions might indicate common involvement in processes. first, the  <dig> proteins within  <dig> kb of position  <dig> , <dig>  share broad annotations of "regulation of biological process" and "intracellular membrane-bound organelle". second, the seven proteins within  <dig> kb of position  <dig> , <dig>  share similarly broad annotations of "transport" and "localization". in either case, these annotations might indicate involvement in a common complex or process in a particular membrane-bound organelle or localization pathway, and might be enough to warrant further investigation into the biological reason for the shared function.

yeast is similarly well characterized, but we again found some examples of genomic windows where application of new high confidence predictions revealed a shared function or related functions. there are two particularly interesting examples. first, the  <dig> kb region of the plus strand of yeast chromosome  <dig> starting at position  <dig>  contains three proteins  that share the annotations "chromatin silencing at telomere" and "telomeric heterochromatin formation". second, the six proteins located in  <dig> kb region of chromosome  <dig> starting at position  <dig>   share the related functions of "signal transducer activity" and "transmembrane receptor activity".

details of individual protein interaction subnetworks and genomic windows, and previous and new annotations for each subnetwork and window can be found in the supplementary data.

discussion
in this analysis, we enriched functional annotation to the three genomes by pfp's high confidence predictions and represented the functional space occupied by the proteomes in the functional similarity network, where edges between proteins  denote significant functional similarity between them. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that structure of functional space is analyzed as a network. taking advantage of the pfp's large annotation coverage  <cit> , more than 90% of proteins in each genome are included in the functional similarity network . this is a significant enrichment especially for the malaria genome, as previously only  <dig> % of proteins were annotated. we defined the functional similarity of proteins using their annotated go terms rather than other possible functional similarity metrics, e.g. the conventional sequence similarity, because go terms can compare proteins in different aspects of functions , which may be more relevant to protein activity in the cell. moreover, proteins with a high sequence similarity shows significant similarity in the annotated go terms as well in majority of the cases, so protein sharing go term similarity can be considered a superset of those sharing sequence similarity  <cit> .

our study revealed interesting characteristics of the functional similarity networks of the three organisms contrasted with the ppi networks. we analyzed the global topology of the functional similarity network by computing the degree exponent, the clustering coefficient, and the clustering degree exponent of the networks . in general, both functional similarity networks and ppi networks follow the power-law, but they are distinct in the former showing the network modularity but the latter does not. among the four functional similarity networks constructed by considering individual go-scores and the funsim score, the funsim score network is different from the others by exhibiting a higher tendency to be hierarchical  similar to the metabolic pathway networks. however, the clustering degree exponent value seems to be sensitive to the similarity threshold value used to construct the networks and the e. coli and yeast funsim score networks drop its value below  <dig>  when some similarity threshold values are used.

unlike the current ppi network data, which provide a static view of protein interactions, the functional similarity networks change their topology as the similarity threshold value is changed. functional similarity networks of a different similarity threshold value represent different levels of granularity of the gene function space in a genome. investigation of the global and local structure properties of dynamically changing functional similarity networks is left as an important future work.

it is reminded that the currently available ppi networks have several limitations; they are usually incomplete and potentially include false positive and false negative interactions  <cit> . however, we expect that such limitations will not affect to this work too much since the focus of this work is the construction of the functional similarity networks and the functional enrichment by pfp. we analyzed the ppi networks as to contrast to the newly introduced functional similarity networks. as a future work, it may be interesting to compare the network properties of the functional similarity networks with other types of biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks  <cit>  or gene functional networks constructed by considering different types of experimental information  <cit> .

individual annotation to subnetworks in the ppi networks and genome local windows identified numerous interesting cases where proteins in the subset show high coherence with other members. these results provide examples of how computational prediction can be utilized in interpreting or building hypotheses on the proteins sharing such functional association. interestingly, there are several cases where proteins in a genome window are functionally coherent with pfp's assignment of broader, less-specific functional terms. these may not be regulons or operons, where functional roles of component genes are usually better defined. rather, these local windows of genes may imply existence of a new type of gene clusters where genes are inter-related by much broader, higher-level functional category.

together with the introduction of the functional similarity networks and functional coherence of individual subsets of genes, we have demonstrated the usefulness of computational function prediction by pfp. the same methods can be applied to any biologically related group of proteins. high-throughput technologies such as microarrays and mass spectrometry that identify clusters of proteins linked by common expression patterns or conditions produce datasets that would also be relevant for such an application. in the end, as pfp is a sequence similarity-based prediction method, utilizing its high confidence predictions takes a minimal time and energy commitment  and can have a significant impact on a researcher's ability to interpret the complex datasets that have now become the norm.

CONCLUSIONS
we assigned function to previously uncharacterized protein genes in escherichia coli k- <dig>  saccaromyces cerevisiae, and plasmodium falciparum with high-confidence function prediction by the pfp method. using the enriched function annotation, we introduced the functional similarity network which provides an intuitive representation of the functional space of a proteome. comparison with the ppi networks revealed distinct features of the functional similarity networks. in addition, pfp's function assignment identified functionally coherent subnetworks in the ppi and local regions in the genomes. all together, this work demonstrated usefulness of the computational functional predictions by pfp.
