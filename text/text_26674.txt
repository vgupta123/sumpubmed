BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan that infects many types of nucleated cells. it is estimated that approximately one-third of the world’s population is chronically infected with tissue cysts of this parasite  <cit> . humans may be infected through ingestion of uncooked or under-cooked meat of intermediate hosts or the oocysts excreted by the definitive host, felis catus. ingested bradyzoites and tachyzoites invade host cells and cause acute infection. in humans, t. gondii infections may cause disseminating damage to the brain, eyes, lymph nodes and even death in some immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . in pregnant women, this parasite can be transmitted to the fetus, resulting in tissue destruction, as well as developmental defects of the fetus or newborn  <cit> . in immunocompetent hosts, tachyzoites are converted into bradyzoites quickly, and a lifelong chronic infection is established.

the molecular mechanism of host cell invasion by t. gondii has been extensively investigated  <cit> . during invasion, a t. gondii tachyzoite attaches to the host cell membrane and forms a moving junction  between the tachyzoite and the host cell membrane by releasing microneme proteins  and rhoptry neck proteins  at the interface of the tachyzoite-host cell surface. afterwards, the tachyzoite membrane and the host cell membrane remain in contact so that the mj moves along the parasite’s surface until the parasitophorous vacuole  is finally formed  <cit> . the mj works as a sieve to exclude many of the host transmembrane proteins but retains gpi-anchored or raft-associated multipass transmembrane proteins on the pv membrane   <cit> . pvm is a non-fusogenic compartment that is resistant to acidification by the endosome-lysosomal system of the host cell, since most of the pvm is derived from the host cell membrane and the transmembrane proteins, which are involved in fusion with lysosomes and are excluded from the pvm  <cit> . during penetration, the parasite injects many rhoptry proteins including rop <dig> into the host cell cytosol, which appear as small satellite vesicles and eventually fuse with the pvm  <cit> . after invasion, the parasite further modifies the pvm by inserting novel proteins secreted by the rhoptries and the dense granules  <cit> . after formation, the pvm closely associates with host mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum  and migrates towards the nucleus using the host microtubule network  <cit> .

gtpases are a large group of enzymes that bind gtp  and catalyze the hydrolysis of gtp to gdp  in the presence of a mg2+ ion. they then undergo conformational changes to release gdp, and thus, cycle between a gtp-bound active form and a gdp-bound inactive form  <cit> . immune related gtpases  are large gtpases containing a ras-like g domain and a helical domain combining n- and c-terminal elements  <cit> , whereas small gtpases are monomeric gtpases with a molecular weight of 21 kda and composed of at least five families: ras, rho, rab, sar1/arf and ran, which exist in eukaryotes from yeast to humans  <cit> . the rho subfamily is further divided into rhoa, rac and cdc <dig>  which regulates cytoskeleton reorganization and gene expression  <cit> .

a group of interferon-inducible large gtpases  and a small gtpase, adp-ribosylation factor- <dig>  of the host cell accumulate on the pvm of invading t. gondii <cit> . ifn-γ-inducible gtpase  is a myristoylated irg and contributes to resistance against t. gondii in mice. irga <dig> is predominantly found in the gdp-bound state in interferon-induced, uninfected cells, but it does accumulate on the pvm after toxoplasma infection and changes to the gtp-bound form. accumulation of irga <dig> on the t. gondii pvm is associated with vesiculation and ultimately disruption of the vacuolar membrane in a process that requires an intact gtp-binding domain  <cit> . arf <dig> is recruited to the pvm of t. gondii rh strain and plays an important role in the parasite cell invasion with activation of pi3-kinase and recruitment of pip <dig> and pip <dig> to the pvm of t. gondii <cit> . the significance of some gtpases in the toxoplasma invasion process has prompted us to further investigate whether other members of the small gtpases are also involved in host cell invasion.

the coverslips were mounted and ready for infection rate counting. for giemsa stained cells, infection rate was the percentage of t. gondii tachyzoites infected cells among  <dig> cells randomly selected. in the cfp-tagged overexpressed group, the infection rate was presented as the percentage of those tachyzoites infected fluorescent cells among  <dig> fluorescent cells randomly selected. the infection rate experiment was performed in triplicate. the infection rates were divided by the mean infection rate of the mock group, and the percentages were used to compare the infection rate difference between different groups.

real-time observation of rhoa gtpase recruited to the pvm following t. gondii tachyzoites invasion
cos- <dig> cells were grown on 2 cm confocal plates and transfected with 3 μg pecfp-n1-rho a wt when cells reached 70% confluency. forty-eight hr later t. gondii rh tachyzoites were used to infect these cos- <dig> cells. the confocal plate was incubated in the tray  and connected to the confocal fluorescence microscope . the process of tachyzoites invading the host cell was visualized and pictures were taken automatically every 10 min.

RESULTS
accumulation of rho and rac gtpases on the pvm
irgs and arf <dig> are members of large and small gtpase families, respectively, which accumulate on the pvm of t. gondii infected cells and play important roles during host cell invasion  <cit> . however, the presence of these two gtpases is insufficient to explain the whole spectrum of cell signaling during infection. to determine whether other gtpases, namely rhoa and rac <dig> are also recruited to the pvm, the tachyzoites of t. gondii rh strain were used to infect human 16-hbe cells, and rho and rac <dig> were localized by indirect immunofluorescence assay  using anti-rho and -rac <dig> antibodies. ifa revealed significant accumulation of these two small gtpases on the pvm. to further verify this observation, cfp-tagged rhoa and rac <dig> were overexpressed in cos- <dig> cells, and  <dig> hr post-transfection, cells were infected with different virulent strains of rh and pru tachyzoites, respectively. regardless of the virulence of the parasite strains used, rhoa and rac <dig> were recruited to the pvm .

real-time observation of recruitment of rhoa gtpase to the pvm
to follow the events of rhoa gtpase recruitment to the pvm, cos- <dig> cells transfected with pecfp-rhoa wt were infected with t. gondii rh tachyzoites. the real-time photographs were taken at  <dig> min post-infection and every  <dig> min thereafter using a confocal fluorescence microscope .

we found that the cfp-tagged rhoa was recruited to the pvm at the very beginning of the invasion, probably through retention of the rhoa gtpase on the host cell membrane to the pvm, and the accumulation of rhoa on the pvm continued with the recruitment of the tachyzoite until it totally invaded into the host cell . however, a focal point of rhoa was not seen at the immediate point of invasion . after the tachyzoite was completely inside the host cell, the fluorescence intensity continually increased with time, suggesting continuous accumulation of the rhoa gtpase on pvm probably by diffusion from the host cell cytosol . the green fluorescence and the dic images showing the invasion processes are provided in additional file 1: data s <dig> and additional file 2: data s <dig> 

the recruitment of rho a and rac <dig> gtpases into pvm is dependent on the gtpase activity
we next investigated if intact gtpase activity was required for pvm recruitment. we used dominant negative mutants of rho and rac <dig>  in our study. these mutants tagged with cfp were overexpressed in cos- <dig> cells. at 48 hr post-transfection, the cells were infected with rh strain tachyzoites. interestingly, the accumulation of these gtpases to the pvm was no longer seen when they were in these inactive forms, which constitutively bind only gdp . thus, the recruitment of these rho gtpases to the pvm only occurred when rho gtpases retained normal activity.

the rho a and rac <dig> gtpases were activated upon t. gondii tachyzoite invasion
to determine if rhoa or rac <dig> gtpases were actually activated following t. gondii tachyzoite invasion, we used gst-tagged rhotekin-rbd protein on agarose beads specific for rhoa or gst-tagged pak-pbd protein bound agarose beads specific for rac only to bind the gtp-bound rhoa or rac <dig> in the cell lysate, but not the gdp-bound form. western-blot analyses detected increased amounts of gtp-bound rhoa and rac <dig> from the infected cells compared with the uninfected cells , but no signals were detected in the negative control  or the t. gondii infected groups. these results strongly suggest that t. gondii invasion results in the activation of rhoa and rac <dig> gtpaes.

the recruitment of rhoa to t. gondii pvm is dependent on different rhoa domains
in order to define what motifs are vital to the recruitment of rho gtpases to the pvm, we concentrated on the study of rho a as a representative protein. sequential deletion of rhoa by  <dig> amino acids with site-directed mutation from the parental plasmid pecfp-rhoa-wt generated  <dig> rhoa mutants. the different cfp-tagged, truncated rhoa plasmids  were transfected into cos- <dig> cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig>  could not be observed on the pvm , indicating the decisive motifs were potentially the gtp/mg2+ binding site, the mdia effector interaction site, the g <dig> box, the g <dig> box and the g <dig> box. the other mutants were all similarly recruited to the pvm as in wild-type rhoa . these results show that the gap  interaction site, the gef  interaction site, the gdi  interaction site, the rho kinase  effector interaction site, the pkn/prk <dig> effector interaction site, the switch i region, the switch ii region, the g <dig> box and the g <dig> box were not the decisive motifs for the recruitment of rhoa to the pvm.

the pvm-localized rho and rac gtpases do not respond to epithelial growth factor  activation
rho gtpases control cell motility by regulating the reorganization of the cytoskeleton in response to egf  <cit> . rho and rac gtpases translocated from the cytosol to the cell membrane upon egf activation  <cit> . to study whether the rho and rac gtpases accumulated on the pvm would translocate following egf activation, the cos- <dig> cells overexpressing cfp-tagged rho and rac <dig> were starved overnight, infected with t. gondii rh tachyzoites and then activated with egf. the result showed that the recruited rho and rac gtpases on the pvm did not change in fluorescence brightness, unlike the fluorescence brightness in the cytosol that became faint because of the translocation of rhoa and rac <dig> from the cytosol to the cell membrane towards the egf activation spot . more photographs showing the rhoa and rac <dig> sequestered on the pvm regardless the activation of egf are provided in additional file 4: data s <dig> 

interference with rhoa and rac <dig> endogenous activity affects tachyzoite infection
to study the role of host cell rhoa and rac <dig> gtpases during the tachyzoites invasion, cos- <dig> cells were over-expressed with rhoa-wt, rhoa-n <dig>  rac1-wt, and rac1-n <dig>  the endogenous expression of rhoa or rac <dig> was inhibited by sirna targeted towards either rhoa or rac <dig> separately or towards both in human 16-hbe cells and then infected with rh tachyzoites. the infection rate was determined for each group. the results indicated that no significant difference was found between the infection rates of rhoa-wt or rac1-wt overexpressed cells and the mock cells . however, the dominant negative mutants rhoa-n <dig> and rac1-n <dig> overexpressed in cos- <dig> cells inhibited the cell invasion by t. gondii tachyzoites significantly; the infection rates were approximately 60% of that of the mock cells  . silencing rhoa, rac <dig> or both rhoa and rac <dig> in 16-hbe cells also showed a significant inhibition of cell invasion by tachyzoites  figure 7c-e). the infection rates of rhoa and rac <dig> silenced cells were about 65% of that of the mock cells, while the infection rate of rhoa and rac <dig> double-silenced cells was about 50% of that of the mock cells .

discussion
the function of the rho and rac gtpases accumulated on pvm
immunity-related gtpases  also known as p <dig> gtpases, are key mediators of interferon-gamma-induced resistance to pathogens  <cit> . they cycle between gdp-gtp bound forms, and cooperatively oligomerize in the gtp-bound conformation on the t. gondii pvm  <cit> . sequential recruitment of multiple irgs to the pvm results in disruption of pvm and parasite digestion within  <dig> hr of infection  <cit> . virulent type i strains resist recruitment and avoid clearance, while less virulent type ii and iii strains are effectively cleared by irgs  <cit> . it was reported that a serine threonine kinase secreted by t. gondii, rop <dig>  binds to and phosphorylates irgs on the pvm, and the phosphorylation of irgs prevented clearance of t. gondii within inflammatory monocytes and ifn-γ-activated macrophages, conferring parasite survival in vivo <cit> . arf <dig> is a small gtpase of the arf family that regulates membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements at the plasma membrane. arf <dig> was found recruited to the pv of t. gondii tachyzoites and arf <dig> activity was necessary for cell invasion by tachyzoites of t. gondii <cit> . these reports about the function of the gtpases on the pvm in t. gondii invasion urged us to hypothesize what is the function of the host cell rho and rac <dig> accumulating on the pvm.

both the indirect immunofluorescence staining of the endogenous rhoa and rac <dig> of the host cell, and the over-expressed cfp-tagged rhoa and rac <dig> recombinant proteins in the host cell indicated the recruitment of rhoa and rac <dig> in the pvm of t. gondii tachyzoites . from the real-time observation of the invasion of the host cell by t. gondii tachyzoites, we found that the recruitment of rhoa to the pvm happened at the very beginning of the invasion either from the membrane or from the cytosol . those over-expressed cfp-tagged dominant negative mutants rhoa-n <dig> and rac1-n <dig> did not accumulate to the pvm  implying the recruitment of rhoa and rac <dig> is dependent on their gtpase activity. the gst-pull down assay detected greater amounts of gtp-bound rhoa and rac <dig> in the infected host cells than in uninfected cells . through cfp-tagged rhoa and rac <dig> being visualized under the gfp filter, we found that rhoa and rac <dig> gtpases in the host cell cytosol were translocated to the host cell membrane following egf activation, while unlike the gtpases in the cytosol, rhoa or rac <dig> on the pvm did not diffuse, translocate or respond to egf activation. egf activates rhoa and rac <dig> through activation of the egf pathway  <cit> . this observation led us to hypothesize that the rho and rac <dig> gtpase recruited on the pvm probably was gtp-bound and could not be activated again by egf, while most of the gtpases in the cytosol are in gdp-bound form and could be continually activated and translocated to the cell membrane upon egf activation .

these observed results imply the invasion of the tachyzoites need the activation of rhoa and rac <dig> gtpases; and the recruitment of these activated gtpases to the pvm is much more than a phenomenon as it may perform some as yet undefined but important function.

the decisive rhoa gtpases motifs for recruitment to parasitophorous vacuole membrane following t. gondii invasion
wild-type rho and rac gtpases with normal gtpase activity were recruited to the pvm, but those mutants that constitutively bind only gdp  lacked this ability. the  <dig> amino acid sequentially deleted rhoa mutants were used in the identification of the definitive motif necessary for the recruitment to the pvm. m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig>  and m <dig>  lacked the ability to be recruited to the pvm . based on the analysis of the rhoa gtpase conserved domains <cit> , the gtp/mg2+ binding site, the mdia effector interaction site, the g <dig> box, the g <dig> box and the g <dig> box are the most potential motifs that determine the recruitment of rhoa gtpases to the pvm .

rho gtpases are molecular switches that cycle between an active gtp-bound and an inactive gdp-bound form, which regulate many essential cellular processes, including actin dynamics, gene transcription, cell-cycle progression and cell adhesion  <cit> . when in the active forms, rho gtpases are able to interact with effector or target molecules to initiate downstream responses, signal transduction terminates when gtp is hydrolyzed to form gdp, and at which point the cycle is finished completely  <cit> . the gtp/mg2+ binding site of rho gtpases is used to bind gtp and mg2+, which activates the gtpases  <cit> . the mdia effector interaction site is the domain that binds with mdia as a downstream rho effector involved in microtubule stabilization. the mdia site induces stable microtubules that are capped and indicates that mdia may promote this microtubule capping by directly binding to microtubules.  <cit> . the g1-g <dig> boxes are the gdp/gtp-binding motif elements that comprise a ~  <dig> kda phosphate domain , which is conserved in all ras super family proteins  <cit> . the decisive motifs are either related to gtp binding or with the effector regulating microtubules. this finding is consistent with our proposal that the recruitment of rho gtpase to pvm depends on its enzymatic activity, and the invasion of t. gondii needs the rearrangement of host cell cytoskeleton.

host cell rhoa and rac <dig> activation is required for efficient cell invasion by t. gondii tachyzoites, which is a shared mechanism by many other intracellular pathogens infection
the major function of rho gtpases activation is to regulate the dynamics and organization of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> , which is vital to the cell invasion of t. gondii tachyzoites. first, t. gondii tachyzoites invasion activates the reorganization of the microfilaments and microtubules of the host cell  <cit> . reorganization of host cell f-actin during entry of toxoplasma tachyzoites has been visualized, and the entry was dependent on the actin dynamics  <cit> . second, any treatment to cease the normal cytoskeleton reorganization of host cells will impair t. gondii invasion efficiency. cell invasion by t. gondii tachyzoites is significantly inhibited in cells treated with colchicum   <cit> , cytochalasin d   <cit>  and jasplakinolide   <cit> . maintenance of host cell actin cytoskeleton integrity is important to parasite invasion  <cit> .

in our research, no significant difference was found in the infection rates of t. gondii tachyzoites in the cells overexpressed with rhoa or rac <dig> wild-type proteins compared with those untransfected cells, while either overexpression of dominant negative mutants of rhoa or rac <dig> or inhibition of endogenous rhoa or rac <dig> in the host cell could significantly reduce cell invasion . this result indicated that it is the normal endogenous activity of rhoa and rac <dig> that defines the efficiency of cell invasion by t. gondii tachyzoites, but not the amount of these proteins. this requirement is also reported in other intracellular pathogens. shigella entry into hela cells induces membrane ruffling at the bacterial entry site, and the three rho isoforms were recruited into bacterial entry sites. this membrane folding caused by invasion was abolished by using a rho-specific inhibitor, and bacterial entry was impaired accordingly  <cit> . hela cells transfected with the dominant negative versions of rac <dig> or rhoa reduced group b streptococcus invasion by 75% and 51%, respectively, suggesting that rho gtpases are indispensable for efficient invasion of hela cells by this bacterium  <cit> . in mdck cells, rhoa and rac1were activated during trypanosoma cruzi invasion and then triggered the reorganization of f-actin cytoskeleton, especially distinct in the invasion position on the cell membrane. the invasion of t. cruzi g strain extracellular amastigotes was specifically inhibited in rac1-n <dig> dominant-negative cells  <cit> . after the invasion of the rabbit corneal epithelial cells  by candida albicans, host cell actin filaments formed a rigid ring-like structure in the host cell. immunochemical staining of actin and the expression of chimeric green fluorescent protein -gtpases  showed the colocalization of the gtpases with actin at invasion and actin polymerization sites, but this colocalization was not seen in sirc cells expressing a gfp-tagged dominant-negative mutant of gtpases. inhibition of invasion was observed in sirc cells expressing dominant-negative mutants of rac <dig> and rhoa gtpases  <cit> . these findings suggest that many pathogens may employ conserved pathways for invasion.

the rho and rac cell signaling involved in the cytoskeleton reorganization triggered by t. gondii invasion
when epithelial cells are stimulated by egf, c-src is activated by egf-induced egf receptor activation  <cit> . after the activation of c-src, ephexin, vav- <dig> and tiam  <dig> are rapidly phosphorylated by c-src  <cit> . phosphorylation of ephexin promotes its gtpase activity toward rhoa  <cit> , and rhoa downstream effector rho-associated kinase rock directly phosphorylates lim-kinases limk <dig> and limk <dig>  which in turn phosphorylates actin-depolymerizing factor destrin and actin-associated protein cofilin  <cit> . rock <dig> kinase phosphorylates crmp <dig>  and the phosphorylation of crmp <dig> reduces its tubulin-heterodimer binding and the promotion of microtubule assembly  <cit> . activation of vav- <dig> activates rhoa and rac <dig>  <cit> . downstream of rac <dig>  p21-activated kinase  <dig>  activates limk <dig>  and regulates the actin cytoskeletal reorganization through the phosphorylation of the actin-depolymerizing factors cofilin and destrin and their actin-depolymerizing activities  <cit> . pak <dig> also phosphorylates arp2/ <dig> complex to promote actin polymerization  <cit> . the f-actin-binding protein cortactin is a prominent target of various tyrosine kinases  and regulates cytoskeletal dynamics  <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin has been suggested to reduce its f-actin cross-linking capability  <cit> . in our research, we are not clear about the upstream cell signaling component of the rho and rac gtpases involved in t. gondii infection, but we have witnessed the activation of rhoa and rac <dig> of host cells and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton for pv formation during the infection of t. gondii. the cell signaling involved in this process is shown in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
rhoa and rac <dig> gtpases from the host cell accumulated on the pvm after t. gondii invasion, and this accumulation was dependent on their gtpase activity and occurred regardless of the virulence of the parasitic strain. rhoa gtpase was recruited to the pvm as soon as the t. gondii tachyzoite invaded the host cell either through the host cell membrane or from the cytosol. host cell rhoa and rac <dig> were activated after t. gondii invasion. the decisive domains for the rhoa accumulation on the pvm were identified as the gtp/mg2+ binding site, the mdia effector interaction site, the g <dig> box, the g <dig> box and the g <dig> box, respectively, which were related to the binding of gtp for enzymatic activity and to mdia for the regulation of microtubules. the reorganization of host cell cytoskeleton facilitates the pv formation and enlargement in the host cell. the recruited rhoa on the pvm could not be activated by epithelial growth factor  and no translocation was observed, which indicated that the recruited rhoa or rac <dig> on the pvm might be in gtp-bound active form.

wild-type rhoa or rac <dig> overexpressed cells had almost the same infection rates by t. gondii as the mock-treated cells, while rhoa-n <dig> or rac1-n <dig> transfected cells and rhoa or rac <dig> sirna- and rhoa + rac <dig> sirna-treated cells showed significantly diminished infection rates than mock cells, which indicated that the normal activity of rhoa and rac <dig> gtpases are indispensable to the internalization of the tachyzoite. the accumulation of the rhoa and rac <dig> on the pvm and the requisite of their normal gtpase activities for efficient invasion implied their involvement and function in t. gondii invasion. the summary of the host cell rhoa and rac <dig> cell signaling involved in the t. gondii invasion is show in figure  <dig>
