BACKGROUND
prolactin  is a peptide hormone/cytokine that is typically secreted from the anterior pituitary gland, and has been found to be locally produced in various other organs such as the prostate, uterus, and mammary gland . upon prl binding, prl-receptor  dimerizes resulting in activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase jak <dig>  and subsequent downstream signaling cascades including signal tranducers and activators of transcription , mitogen activated protein kinases , including erk1/ <dig>  and phosphoinositol- <dig> kinase pathways . prl signaling at both an endocrine and paracrine/autocrine levels regulates a variety of physiological processes in an eclectic range of tissues . there is mounting evidence that prl plays a significant role in breast cancer. the prlr has been found in the vast majority of human breast cancers and prl signaling has been implicated in breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, motility and angiogenesis . furthermore, elevated circulating prl levels have been positively correlated with breast cancer metastasis and prlr-deficient mice have prevention of neoplasia progression into invasive carcinoma . importantly, prl has been noted as a chemoattractant for breast cancer cells and augments tumor metastasis in nude mice  <cit> . however, the exact mechanisms guiding prl-induced cell migration and tumor metastasis are not fully understood.

we have implicated the serine/threonine kinase pak <dig>  as a substrate of prl-activated jak <dig>  <cit> . pak <dig> has been associated with breast cancer progression . aberrant expression/activation of pak <dig> has been described in breast cancer as well as among several other cancers including brain, pancreas, colon, bladder, ovarian, hepatocellular, urinary tract, renal cell carcinoma, and thyroid cancers . the pak <dig> gene lies within the 11q <dig> region and 11q <dig>  → 11q <dig> amplifications involving the pak <dig> locus are present in 17 % of breast cancers  <cit> . pak <dig> overexpression was observed in over half of observed breast tumor specimens  <cit>  and pak <dig> expression is correlated with tumor grade . in transgenic mouse models, hyperactivation of pak <dig> promotes mammary gland tumor formation  <cit> . interestingly, overexpression of constitutively active pak <dig> t423e in non-invasive breast cancer cells stimulates cell motility and anchorage independence  <cit> , while expression of kinase dead pak in highly invasive breast cancer cells significantly reduces cell invasiveness  <cit> . pak <dig> kinase activity promotes directional cell motility and is a major regulator of the actin cytoskeleton . we have previously demonstrated that prl-activated jak <dig> directly phosphorylates pak <dig> on tyrosines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that tyrosyl phosphorylated pak <dig>  enhances prl-mediated cell invasion via mapk activation and increased matrix metalloproteinase expression  <cit>  as well as cell motility through increased phosphorylation of actin-crosslinking protein filamin a . additionally, prl-induced ptyr-pak <dig> is localized at small adhesion complexes at the cell periphery and regulates adhesion turnover in breast cancer cells, a process that is absolutely critical for cell motility  <cit> .

cell motility is essential in the regulation of many significant biological processes including embryogenesis, wound healing, and immune responses; however aberrant cell migration is present in malignant cancers and results in the establishment of tumors in distant tissues. cell motility is a highly coordinated process that requires tight regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell-matrix adhesion turnover, and complex intracellular signaling cascades. the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase  has been implicated as an important regulator of cell motility . fak is localized to cell/matrix adhesions and is activated by integrin engagement to the extracellular matrix as well as by several other extracellular ligands . auto-phosphorylation of fak at tyrosine  <dig>  promotes fak activation and recruits sh2- and sh3-domain containing proteins, most notably c-src, leading to src-mediated fak activation and activation of src/fak signaling pathways, including the erk mapk signaling cascade . fak activation has been most well implicated in the positive regulation of cell motility . however, recently more evidence has demonstrated a controversial role for fak as a negative regulator of cancer cell migration .

here we extend our knowledge on the role for ptyr-pak <dig> in prl-induced breast cancer cell motility and invasion. we use t47d and tmx2- <dig> breast cancer cells stably overexpressing gfp, pak <dig> wt, or tyrosyl phosphorylation-deficient mutant of pak <dig> in which the three jak <dig> phosphorylation sites have been mutated to phenylalanine . these cells were previously characterized in  <cit>  and  <cit> . we demonstrate here that tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> in response to prl regulates ptp-pest-dependent fak dephosphorylation, resulting in augmented breast cancer cell migration and invasion and proposed the mechanism explaining these findings. furthermore, we provide in vivo evidence that prl-induced ptyr-pak <dig> increases breast cancer cell metastasis. taken together, these data suggest that prl-mediated ptyr-pak <dig> is important in regulating the dynamic activation of fak and subsequent breast cancer cell migration and invasion.

RESULTS
tyrosyl phosphorylated pak <dig> negatively regulates fak auto-phosphorylation
we have previously demonstrated that prl promotes breast cancer cell motility in a ptyr-pak1-dependent manner  <cit> . in an attempt to understand the ptyr-pak1-dependent mechanism that regulates prl-induced cell motility, we first examined the auto-phosphorylation of fak in response to prl, as fak is an important regulator of cell motility . t47d gfp , pak <dig> wt, or pak <dig> y3f  clones were treated with prl over a time-course and whole cell lysates  were analyzed for fak auto-phosphorylation at y <dig>  which is critical for src/fak interaction and maximal fak activation . prl treatment led to maximal fak auto-phosphorylation in 15 min in control gfp cells . on the contrary, there was no significant y397-fak auto-phosphorylation in response to prl in the pak <dig> wt cells , suggesting that prl-induced ptyr-pak <dig> has a negative effect on fak auto-phosphorylation. fak was maximally auto-phosphorylated by prl in  <dig>  min in pak <dig> y3f cells . similar results were obtained in tmx2- <dig>  stably overexpressing gfp, myc-pak <dig> wt, or myc-pak <dig> y3f  indicating that this finding was not restricted to t47d cells. it is important to note that prl-dependent y395-fak phosphorylation was transient in both t47d gfp and t47d pak <dig> y3f clones. our data suggest that tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> in response to prl promotes fak dephosphorylation and tyrosines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of pak <dig> are responsible for this effect.fig.  <dig> tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> negatively regulates prl-induced fak auto-phosphorylation. a whole cell lysates  of t47d cells stably overexpressing gfp, pak <dig> wt, or pak <dig> y3f treated with prl  for the indicated times were probed for fak auto-phosphorylation using αpy397-fak antibody. the expression levels of γtubulin were used as an internal loading control. b graph represents the densitometric analysis of the bands obtained for py397-fak normalized to total fak for at least  <dig> independent experiments. the solid line represents t47d gfp cells, the dashed line represents t47d pak <dig> wt cells, and the dotted line represents t47d pak <dig> y3f cells. bars represent mean ± se. *p <  <dig>  compared with the same cells not treated with prl

tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> promotes s298-mek <dig> phosphorylation and erk activation in response to prl
to uncover the mechanism by which ptyr-pak <dig> may regulate fak phosphorylation, we assessed s298-mek phosphorylation and consequent erk1/ <dig> activation  in response to prl because a pak1/mek/erk signaling cascade has been implicated in ras-mediated fak dephosphorylation  <cit> . prl promoted pak1-dependent mek phosphorylation 6-fold in as early as  <dig>  min and maximal 8-fold mek phosphorylation after 15 min in t47d pak <dig> wt cells . prl also induced ps298-mek signal in the t47d gfp and t47d pak <dig> y3f cells albeit slower and to a lesser extent when compared to the pak <dig> wt cells . subsequently, erk1/ <dig> was phosphorylated in response to prl in all three t47d clones, however earlier and to a much greater extent in the pak <dig> wt cells when compared to gfp and pak <dig> y3f cells . similar results were obtained in tmx2- <dig> gfp, pak <dig> wt and pak <dig> y3f cell clones . these data suggest that pak <dig> tyrosyl phosphorylation promotes pak-dependent mek phosphorylation and erk activation in response to prl.

protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition rescues prl-mediated auto-phosphorylation of fak
in order to determine whether tyrosine phosphatases are involved in the negative effect of ptyr-pak <dig> on fak auto-phosphorylation, we assessed y397- fak phosphorylation in response to prl in the presence or absence of na3vo <dig>  a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. t47d pak <dig> wt cells were treated with vehicle or na3vo <dig> for one hour before prl treatment and wcl were assessed for py397-fak . as expected, there was no prl-mediated increase in fak tyrosyl phosphorylation in vehicle treated cells . however, phosphatase inhibition led to a significant increase in both basal and prl-induced fak auto-phosphorylation . to confirm that phosphatase activity is important for the ptyr-pak1-dependent effect of prl on fak dephosphorylation, all three t47d clones were subjected to a prl time-course in the presence of na3vo <dig> and wcl were assessed for y <dig> fak auto-phosphorylation . in the presence of na3vo <dig>  prl treatment activated fak in all three cell lines regardless of the status of pak <dig> tyrosyl phosphorylation . furthermore, fak remained phosphorylated until the end of the prl time-course in all three clones in the presence of na3vo <dig> fig.  <dig> protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition rescues prl-mediated fak auto-phosphorylation in t47d wt cells. a tyrosine phosphatase inhibition by na3vo <dig> permits prl-induced fak auto-phosphorylation in pak <dig> wt cells. wcl of t47d pak <dig> wt cells treated with either vehicle  or na3vo <dig>  for 1 h before prl  treatment were probed for fak auto-phosphorylation by αpy397-fak antibody. b fak is auto-phosphorylation in t47d gfp, pak <dig> wt, and pak <dig> y3f cells in response to prl in the presence of na3vo <dig>  the cells were treated with na3vo <dig> as in a and with prl  for the indicated times. fak auto-phosphorylation was assessed as in a. the expression levels of γtubulin were used as an internal loading control. c graph represents the densitometric analysis of the bands obtained for py397-fak normalized to total fak for at least  <dig> independent experiments. bars represent mean ± se. *p <  <dig>  compared with the same cells not treated with prl



next we aimed to determine whether tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest, which dephosphorylates fak at y <dig>  <cit> , participates in prl- and pak1-dependent lack of fak auto-phosphorylation. ptp-pest silencing in t47d and tmx2- <dig> clones was confirmed by rt-pcr method . we performed sirna-based silencing of ptp-pest in t47d  and tmx2- <dig>  clones, treated the cells with or without prl and assessed for y <dig> fak auto-phosphorylation. indeed, ptp-pest silencing rescued y397-fak phosphorylation in pak <dig> wt cells to similar levels to that of gfp and pak <dig> y3f cells in response to prl . on the contrary, there was no significant y397-fak auto-phosphorylation in response to prl in the pak <dig> wt clones transfected with control sirna .fig.  <dig> silencing of tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest rescues fak auto-phosphorylation in t47d and tmx2- <dig> cells. a ptp-pest sirna reduces ptp-pest mrna in t47d and tmx2- <dig> cells. t47d and tmx2- <dig> cells were transfected with either ptp-pest sirna or control non-coding sirna  and mrna levels were assessed by rt-pcr using ptp-pest-specific primers. gapdh primers were used an internal control. b wcl of t47d and tmx2- <dig> clones transfected with control or ptp-pest sirnas and treated with prl  for  <dig> or 15 min were probed for fak auto-phosphorylation using αpy397-fak antibody. the expression levels of γtubulin were used as an internal loading control. c graph represents the densitometric analysis of the bands obtained for py397-fak normalized to total fak



these data suggest that tyrosine phosphatase activity of ptp-pest is responsible for the apparent lack of fak auto-phosphorylation in response to prl in pak <dig> wt cells. given the complexity of these signaling cascades, it is likely that additional signaling molecules are also involved in the modulation of fak phosphorylation.

protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition impedes prl-mediated t47d and tmx2- <dig> cell migration and invasion
to investigate whether tyrosine phosphatases regulate prl/ptyr-pak1-dependent t47d breast cancer cell migration, we examined migration of t47d clones in the presence and absence of prl and na3vo <dig> for 48 h. as dynamic tyrosyl phosphorylation events are crucial to many cellular processes, it was important to test whether phosphatase inhibition for an extended period of 48 h had any cytotoxic effect. the cell viability was assessed in serum deprived t47d cells treated with or without prl and na3vo <dig> . na3vo <dig> had no significant cytotoxic effect on any of the three stable cell lines in the presence or absence of prl . next, the effect of tyrosine phosphatase inhibition on prl-mediated cell migration was assessed using a transwell migration assay. equal numbers of t47d gfp, pak <dig> wt and pak <dig> y3f cells were seeded into the upper part of a boyden chamber with or without na3vo <dig> and prl or vehicle were added to the bottom part. the number cells that migrated through the chamber towards prl were counted . as we demonstrated previously  <cit> , prl stimulated cell migration to a greater extent in pak <dig> wt cells when compared to gfp and pak <dig> y3f cells in the absence of na3vo <dig> . however, phosphatase inhibition by na3vo <dig> completely abolished cell migration in response to prl in all t47d clones . these data suggest that phosphatase activity is required for ptyr-pak1-induced cell migration.fig.  <dig> protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition impedes prl-mediated t47d cell migration and invasion. a, b equal amounts of t47d gfp, pak wt, or pak <dig> y3f cells were loaded into the upper part of the boyden chamber uncovered  or covered with matrigel  with or without na3vo <dig> . prl  was added to the lower part. representative brightfield images of the cells migrated/invaded to the lower chamber were taken in 48 h. a lucplan fln 40x objective lens and wide field whn 10x eyepiece on an inverted olympus ix <dig> microscope were used.  na3vo <dig>  treatment on t47d cells for 48 h has no cytotoxic effect. d, e the number of cells that migrated to the lower surface of the chamber toward prl  or vehicle  after 48 h was counted and plotted. bars represent mean ± se. *p <  <dig>  compared with the same cells not treated with prl



cell migration is a key step in cell invasion so we decided to assess the effect of phosphatase inhibition on cell invasion. equal numbers of t47d gfp, pak <dig> wt and pak <dig> y3f cells were seeded into the upper chamber of a boyden chamber coated with matrigel, in the presence of either na3vo <dig> or vehicle. deprivation media with or without prl  was added to the lower chamber of the boyden chamber. the number of cells that invaded through the matrigel towards prl was counted. as we demonstrated previously  <cit> , prl stimulated cell invasion to a greater extent in pak <dig> wt cells when compared to gfp and pak <dig> y3f cells in the absence of na3vo <dig> . however, na3vo4-mediated tyrosine phosphatase inhibition abolished cell invasion in response to prl in all t47d clones .

to demonstrate that the role of pak <dig> in prl-mediated signaling is not limited to t47d cells, we assessed migration and invasion in the presence and absence of na3vo <dig> in tmx2- <dig> clones. in tmx2- <dig> gfp and tmx2- <dig> wt cells prl induced cell migration  and invasion  while in tmx2- <dig> y3f cells did not . however, na3vo <dig> treatment abolished prl-dependent cell migration and invasion in all tmx2- <dig> clones . silencing of ptp-pest also abolished prl-dependent cell migration and invasion of all t47d clones  and migration of tmx2- <dig> clones . prl-induced invasion of tmx2- <dig> control  and wt cells was significantly decreased by silencing of ptp-pest although not completely abolished  suggesting that, in addition to ptp-pest, other tyrosine phosphatases may participate in the ptyr-pak1-dependent invasion of tmx2- <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> silencing of the tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest reduces prl-mediated cell migration and invasion. a tyrosine phosphatase inhibition abolishes prl-induced tmx2- <dig> cell migration a and invasion b. tmx2- <dig> gfp, pak wt, or pak <dig> y3f cells were assessed as in fig.  <dig>  c–f equal amount of t47d  or tmx2- <dig>  clones were transfected with either control or ptp-pest sirna and loaded into the upper part of the boyden chamber covered  or not  with matrigel. the number of cells that migrated/invaded to the lower chamber toward prl  or vehicle  after 48 h was counted and plotted. bars represent mean ± se. *p <  <dig>  compared with the same cells not treated with prl. #p <  <dig>  compared with the same cells treated with prl but transfected with control sirna 



pak <dig> tyrosyl phosphorylation stimulates prl-induced tumor metastasis in vivo
cell migration is critical for tumor cell metastasis. in order to assess whether prl-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> has a physiological effect on breast cancer metastasis, tmx2- <dig> stably overexpressing gfp, myc-pak <dig> wt, or myc-pak <dig> y3f were inoculated in mouse mammary fat pads and mice were treated with prl for 8 weeks. tumors and lungs were harvested and homogenized and proteins were separated by sds-page and analyzed for myc-tagged pak <dig> to indicate metastasis of the primary tumor into distant tissues. we focused on the primary tumor and the lungs, as the lungs are one of the most common sites for secondary tumor in patients with metastatic breast cancer. as expected, each primary tumor from all pak <dig> wt and pak <dig> y3f mice was positive for myc-tagged pak <dig>  while gfp cells do not produce tumors. myc-tagged pak <dig> was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> lungs from the pak <dig> wt mice while there was no detectable myc-pak <dig> in any of the pak <dig> y3f or gfp mouse lungs . tumors and lungs were also fixed and analyzed by immunocytochemistry  with anti-myc. our ihc analysis revealed that anti-myc signal was detected in breast tumor  of myc-pak <dig> wt- and myc-pak <dig> y3f-inoculated mice  as well as in lung of myc-pak <dig> wt-inoculated mice  but not in lungs of control gfp-  or pak <dig> y3f-inoculated mice . these data provide first in vivo evidence that tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> plays a significant role in prl-induced breast cancer cell motility and metastasis, as only cells overexpressing pak <dig> wt, but not phospho-tyrosine-deficient pak <dig> y3f, were able to migrate from the primary tumor to the lungs. here we provide new insight into the mechanisms regulating prl-dependent breast cancer cell metastasis.fig.  <dig> pak <dig> tyrosyl phosphorylation stimulates prl-induced tumor metastasis in vivo. a myc-pak <dig> was detected in all tumor lysates isolated from myc-pak <dig> wt and myc-pak <dig> y3f inoculated mice. prl-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak1increased tumor metastasis, as  <dig> out of  <dig> lungs from wt mice contained myc-pak <dig> . no myc-pak <dig> was detected in any of the lungs from the y3f or gfp mice. anti-tubulin antibody was used as a loading control. whole cell lysate  of tmx2- <dig> pak <dig> wt cells was loaded as a control for pak1-myc position in the gels. b–f representative images of myc-pak <dig> detected with anti-myc in breast tumor  and lung tissue . myc-pak <dig> was detected in breast tumors of myc-pak <dig> wt-  and y3f-  and lung of myc-pak <dig> wt- inoculated mice  but not in lungs of gfp  or pak <dig> y3f-inoculated mice . the arrow highlights metastatic nodule. counterstaining with hematoxylin was omitted. scale bar is 200 μm in  and 100 μm in 



discussion
the role of pak <dig> in the regulation of cell motility is well documented . the role of pak <dig> in the regulation of cell adhesion is also well documented and at least one mechanism has been proposed . according to this mechanism, pak <dig> phosphorylates paxillin on ser <dig>  leading to increased paxillin-git <dig> binding and adhesion turnover  <cit> . we have previously implicated prl/jak2-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> in regulation of cell motility and invasion  <cit> . we have also implicated ptyr-pak <dig> in the regulation of breast cancer cell adhesion and demonstrated that phosphorylation of tyrsines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of pak <dig> regulates cell adhesion, contribute to maximal pak <dig> kinase activity and increased ability to bind βpix and git <dig>  <cit> . here we extend our findings and demonstrate that ptyr-pak <dig> phosphorylates mek <dig> on ser <dig> resulting in subsequent erk1/ <dig> activation. we also show that prl-induced fak auto-phosphorylation on tyr <dig> is inhibited by ptyr-pak <dig> and can be rescued by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases and silencing tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest. these tyrosine phosphatase inhibitions abrogate cell motility and invasion in response to prl. we hypothesize that pser910-fak recruits tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest to dephosphorylate ptyr397-fak and thereby promotes cell motility as shown previously  <cit> .

dynamic of fak phosphorylation is significant for cell motility. previously, fak activation has been demonstrated to positively regulate cell motility  however it is becoming evident that the role of fak activation in cell migration is more complex. silencing fak using sirna enhanced hela cell migration on collagen, and fak dephosphorylation on y <dig> by the tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest promoted ras-induced cell migration in transformed nih3t3-v-h-ras cells  <cit> . cells with reduced fak dephosphorylation had diminished cell motility  <cit>  and overexpression of the tyrosine phosphatase lmr-ptp, which dephosphorylates fak, enhanced cell motility  <cit> . importantly, zheng et al. implicated pak <dig> in regulation of ras-induced fak dephosphorylation, as overexpression of constitutively active pak <dig> t423e promoted fak dephosphorylation while inhibition of pak <dig> severely abolished fak dephosphorylation at y <dig>  <cit> . with agreement with these data, we have shown here that ptyr-pak <dig> abolished prl-dependent phosphorylation of ser397-fak.

we previously demonstrated that tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> promotes both pak <dig> kinase activity and protein-protein interaction capabilities . pak <dig> directly binds to erk in response to adhesion to fibronectin, and both pak <dig> and erk co-localize at nascent adhesions on the cell periphery  <cit> . here, pak <dig> can serve as a scaffold, bringing together raf, mek and erk at cell/matrix adhesions and thereby stimulating erk-dependent signal transduction  <cit> . in addition to pak <dig> scaffolding activity, pak <dig> promotes raf activation by directly phosphorylated raf on s338/ <dig>  <cit> , and stimulates mek/erk binding and subsequent erk activity by directly phosphorylating s <dig> on mek <dig> . importantly, ps298-mek has been shown to localize at peripheral adhesion complexes in response to cell adhesion to fibronectin  <cit> . concurrently, we have demonstrated that tyrosyl phosphorylated pak <dig> is localized at peripheral adhesion complexes in response to prl and is responsible for proper adhesion turnover, an important process in cell migration  <cit> . this is important, as fak is also localized at peripheral adhesion complexes and dynamic fak localization and phosphorylation is important for proper adhesion turnover and cell migration . fak localization to peripheral cell/matrix adhesions is dependent on its focal adhesion targeting  domain and binding to adhesion proteins paxillin and vinculin  <cit> . paxillin phosphorylation at y <dig> and y <dig> by fak is necessary for cell migration and adhesion turnover , however, constitutive tyrosyl phosphorylation of paxillin impedes cell migration, and dephosphorylation of fak by ptp-pest is required for proper adhesion turnover in migrating cells  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression of the dominant negative form of protein phosphatase lmr-ptp leads to fak hyperphosphorylation and reduced cell motility  <cit>  suggesting that complex regulation of fak at adhesion complexes is necessary for proper cell migration. phosphorylation of the fak fat domain on s <dig> and y <dig> by erk <dig> and src, respectively, results in reduced fak/paxillin binding and promotes adhesion turnover  <cit> . furthermore, ps298-mek/erk activation in nih3t <dig> cells was shown to induce fak dephosphorylation through erk-mediated fak s <dig> phosphorylation and resulting recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest and thereby promote cell motility  <cit> . in this regard, prl-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> and resulting adhesion localization could be creating localized pak1/mapk/fak signaling at adhesion complexes and promoting adhesion turnover during cell migration.

in the present study we demonstrated that tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> stimulates tumor cell metastasis in vivo. these data, combined with an animal study reporting prevention of neoplasia progression into invasive carcinoma in prl receptor deficient mice  <cit> , suggest that prl is involved in the development of metastasis and tumor progression. thus, our current data on ptyr-pak <dig> regulation of fak phosphorylation bring insight into the mechanism of prl-stimulated motility of breast cancer cells.

CONCLUSIONS
here we propose a mechanism by which prl regulates motility of t47d and tmx2- <dig> cells through ptyr-pak <dig>  mek/erk and fak that integrates our findings with previous studies . in response to prl, fak is auto-phosphorylated and pak <dig> is tyrosyl phosphorylated by jak <dig>  stimulating pak <dig> kinase activity and increasing pak <dig> protein-protein binding abilities. we show that tyrosyl phosphorylated pak <dig> phosphorylates mek at serine  <dig>  resulting in mek-mediated erk1/ <dig> activation. activated erk phosphorylates fak at s <dig>  leading to subsequent recruitment of ptp-pest and dephosphorylation of y397-fak  <cit> . prl-dependent down-regulation of fak activity may promote focal contact turnover thereby promoting cell migration. finally, we demonstrate for the first time that tyrosyl phosphorylation of pak <dig> by prl increases breast cancer cell metastasis in vivo.fig.  <dig> proposed mechanism for the role of prl-activated pak <dig> in breast cancer cell migration. prl binding to the prlr results in activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase jak <dig>  jak <dig> tyrosyl phosphorylates pak <dig> on y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  enhancing pak <dig> kinase and scaffolding activities. prl treatment also leads to fak auto-phosphorylation at y <dig>  activated pak <dig> phosphorylates mek <dig> at s <dig>  resulting in increased mek1/erk binding and enhanced erk activity. active erk phosphorylates fak at s <dig>  leading to dephosphorylation of fak at y <dig> by the tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest as shown by zheng et al. . fak dephosphorylation decreases fak kinase activity and promotes adhesion turnover and breast cancer cell migration
