BACKGROUND
smoothelin-like  <dig> protein , also termed calponin homology-associated with smooth muscle  protein, was originally identified as a protein phosphorylated in response to cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase  and protein kinase g ) activation during calcium desensitization of gastrointestinal smooth muscle  <cit> . additional studies have revealed a role for smtnl <dig> in vascular smooth muscle contractile activity, as well as cardiovascular and skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise, development and pregnancy .

the ubiquitous calmodulin  is the primary cellular signal transducer that provides spatial and temporal responses to changes in intracellular calcium levels  <cit> . cam provides signaling by association with specific binding sites in target proteins, both in its calcium-saturated  or its calcium-free  form  <cit> . we have previously reported that smtnl <dig> possesses two cam-binding sites: a classic cam-binding domain  in the center of the protein as well as an iq-motif that serves as an apo-cam-binding site  located in the carboxy-terminal calponin homology domain . smtnl <dig> was established as a bona fide cam-binding protein within aortic a7r <dig> smooth muscle cells using the proximity ligation assay. in this regard, cbd <dig> is thought to provide the majority of cam-binding in situ; however, cbd <dig> may contribute cooperatively to binding  <cit> .

a second binding partner of smtnl <dig> has also been identified in smooth muscle. tropomyosin , a muscle protein that aids in the stabilization of actin filaments, is incorporated as super-helical polymers along smooth muscle thin filaments and contribute to the regulation of actin-myosin cross bridge cycling during smooth muscle contraction . in smooth muscle, two tpm isoforms  are predominantly expressed  <cit> . smtnl <dig> was shown to associate with smooth muscle tpm α/β dimers with a binding surface comprising of its n-terminal intrinsically-disordered region and the c-terminal calponin homology domain  <cit> .

previous in vitro studies have defined smtnl <dig> as a tpm- and cam-binding protein . moreover, the phosphorylation of smtnl <dig> was identified during calcium desensitization of smooth muscle  <cit> . however, the effect of phosphorylation on the ability of smtnl <dig> to associate with tpm and/or cam has not been investigated. intriguingly, the binding domains for cam  are localized in close vicinity to the tpm-binding surface on the smtnl <dig> protein. in addition, the ser <dig> phosphorylation site targeted by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases  is located near cbd <dig> and within the tpm-binding region  <cit> . this led us to inquire about the interplay of smtnl <dig> phosphorylation and calcium levels on the multi-functionality of tpm- and cam-binding. herein, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of ser <dig> greatly enhanced the ability of smtnl <dig> to associate with smooth muscle tpm in vitro. the effect of ser <dig> phosphorylation on cam binding was more complex and varied with the availability of calcium. combining both cam and tpm revealed that binding with smtnl <dig> was mutually exclusive.

expression and purification of smtnl1
a clone comprising the tpm-binding region of smtnl <dig>  was described previously  <cit> . smtnl1-tmb was expressed as a glutathione s-transferase -fusion protein in e. coli and purified with glutathione-sepharose. the fusion protein was cleaved with prescission protease, and gst was removed by an additional pass over glutathione-sepharose along with a final clean-up using monoq anion exchange chromatography. in some cases, smtnl1-tmb was phosphorylated with pka at a molar ratio of 500: <dig>  in a buffer consisting of 2 mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm atp, 25 mm hepes and 150 mm nacl. the phosphorylated protein was buffer-exchanged and concentrated using a 3 kda cut-off centrifugation filter unit .

tpm-sepharose binding assay
purified smooth muscle tpm or tris-hcl  was covalently bound to cnbr-activated sepharose following the manufacturers’ instructions and as described in  <cit> . smtnl1-tmb  was incubated with 40 μl of tpm-sepharose or control-sepharose in binding buffer  β-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h at 4 °c and then washed extensively with the same buffer supplemented with 150 mm nacl. bound protein was eluted with sds-page loading buffer, separated by gel electrophoresis, and detected by coomassie stain.

calmodulin-sepharose binding assay
calmodulin -sepharose pull-down experiments were completed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, smtnl1-tmb  was incubated with 40 μl of cam-sepharose in binding buffer  or 1 mm edta ). after incubation for 1 h at 4 °c, the cam-sepharose was washed extensively with the same buffer supplemented with 150 mm nacl. bound smtnl1-tmb protein was eluted with sds-page loading buffer, separated by gel electrophoresis, and detected by coomassie stain. in some experiments, smtnl1-tmb was premixed with tpm in different molar ratios, allowed to form complexes for 1 h at 4 °c and then added to the cam-sepharose.

RESULTS
phosphorylation of smtnl <dig> by pka enhances tpm-binding potential
full-length smtnl <dig> protein exhibits reduced stability that complicates conclusions from in vitro binding experiments. a truncated form of smtnl <dig>  was used since this clone is stable under the conditions and times used; furthermore, smtnl1-tmb contains all known functional elements of smtnl <dig>  domain, tpm-binding regions and ser <dig> phosphorylation site; fig. 1a). smtnl1-tmb could be effectively phosphorylated with pka; the phosphorylation stoichiometry was assessed with phos-tag sds-page and judged to be complete  after 16 h incubation at 4 °c . the binding of smtnl1-tmb to tpm was examined in pull-down assays with purified smooth muscle tpm  immobilized to sepharose resin . smtnl1-tmb was recovered from tpm-sepharose while no interaction with control-sepharose was observed . some tpm could be released from the sepharose column with application of sds elution buffer and boiling. this was anticipated given that smooth muscle tpm exists as coiled-coil heterodimers  <cit> , and it was unlikely that all tpm molecules could be covalently coupled to the cnbr-sepharose resin. approximately 2-fold more phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb could be recovered from pull-down assays with tpm-sepharose  when compared with unphosphorylated smtnl1-tmb. binding constants for a kinetic series, 0–10 μm phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb provided a k
d of  <dig>  × 10−7m with biophysical analyses by spr , a response that was enhanced 10-fold when compared to unphosphorylated smtnl1-tmb . the spr assays provided a similar k
d for unphosphorylated smtnl <dig> and tpm as previously defined by isothermal titration calorimetry  assays  <cit> . we previously reported that the smtnl <dig> binding surface for tpm included a central portion of the intrinsically-disordered region, located proximal to the ser <dig> phosphorylation site, as well as a surface of the calponin homology  domain located at the c-terminus  <cit> . so, it is not unexpected that phosphorylation at ser <dig> could alter the electrostatic properties and/or the intramolecular conformation of the tpm-binding surface on smtnl <dig> fig.  <dig> the phosphorylation of smtnl <dig> by pka alters its tropomyosin-binding potential. a the smtnl <dig> protein contains: a c-terminal calponin homology  domain, ser <dig> pka-phosphorylation site, ca-calmodulin -binding domain , apo-cam-binding domain , and tropomyosin -binding domain . b purified recombinant smtnl1-tmb was incubated with pka as described in the methods section. samples were withdrawn at the indicated times and subjected to phos-tag sds-page; two discrete bands representing unphosphorylated smtnl1-tmb  or smtnl1-tmb phosphorylated at ser <dig>  were detected by coomassie stain. samples subjected to phos-tag sds-page in the absence of mncl <dig> confirmed the shift in band migration to be a result of phosphorylation. c unphosphorylated or phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb  was incubated with 40 μl of tpm-sepharose . bound smtnl1-tmb was eluted with boiling  <dig> % sds solution and detected with coomassie staining of sds-page gels. d the smtnl1-tmb bands were quantified by densitometry, and binding to tpm-sepharose was expressed as percentage of the smtnl1-tmb binding found for the unphosphorylated state. all experiments are n = 3– <dig> and were analyzed by student’s t-test. *- significantly different from unphosphorylated smtnl1-tmb, p <  <dig> 




phosphorylation of smtnl1-tmb influences binding to cam-sepharose
the ser <dig> phosphorylation site of smtnl <dig> is located in close proximity to the ca-cam binding domain . it was expected that the phosphorylation of smtnl1-tmb by pka would impact the association with ca-cam and not with apo-cam, since the binding of the latter was linked to an iq-domain at the c-terminus . indeed, we observed reductions in ca-cam-sepharose binding for phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb, with recovery of approximately 30% less bound material . surprisingly, the phosphorylation of smtnl1-tmb protein also impacted upon binding to apo-cam-sepharose . although a general reduction in smtnl1-tmb bound to cam was observed in the apo condition , the recovery of phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb from the resin was further reduced to approximately 20% of the unphosphorylated material . we have previously demonstrated that the binding of smtnl1-tmb to cam was influenced by calcium, with smtnl <dig> binding to cam-sepharose decreased by approximately 50% in the apo-calcium condition  <cit> .fig.  <dig> interdependency of smtnl <dig> phosphorylation, calcium and tropomyosin on calmodulin-binding. smtnl1-tmb  was incubated with an equimolar amount of tpm. the mixture was then incubated with cam-sepharose  in the presence  or absence  of calcium. some experiments were completed with smtnl1-tmb that had been previously phosphorylated with pka. after washing, the retention of smtnl1-tmb or phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb was analyzed. the band densities were quantified and binding to cam-sepharose expressed as percentage of smtnl1-tmb recovered under maximal binding conditions . all experiments are n = 3– <dig> and were analyzed by one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc analysis. different letters indicate significant differences among groups 




phosphorylation and calcium influence smtnl1-tmb binding to cam-sepharose in the presence of tpm
equimolar amounts of smtnl1-tmb and tpm proteins were pre-incubated and then applied to cam-sepharose so that competition between cam and tpm for binding to smtnl1-tmb could be assessed. binding of smtnl1-tmb to apo-cam-sepharose was reduced by approximately 60% by the addition of tpm to smtnl1-tmb prior to capture with the resin . these data indicate that tpm could interfere with the apo-cam binding properties of smtnl1-tmb, likely due to the proximity of the two binding sites within the calponin homology  domain. furthermore, we can conclude that smtnl1-tmb interacts with tpm more strongly than with apo-cam. this was not unexpected as the interaction of smtnl <dig> with apo-cam is weak . the results of the binding assays were not affected by the order of addition of proteins since pre-incubating smtnl1-tmb with cam-sepharose followed by competition with tpm showed the same reduction in binding . the subsequent addition of tpm to the mixture of phosphorylated smtnl <dig> and apo-cam-sepharose, shown in fig. 2b, further decreased binding potential to barely detectably levels. when investigating interactions with ca-cam, the binding of unphosphorylated smtnl1-tmb to ca-cam-sepharose was not significantly influenced by the addition of equimolar amounts of tpm . however, the addition of tpm did significantly reduce the recovery of phosphorylated smtnl-tmb on the ca-cam-sepharose resin.

smtnl <dig> phosphorylation diminishes ca-cam-binding potential under conditions of high tpm content
the intracellular tpm concentration is predicted to be significantly higher than that of smtnl <dig>  as judged from the relative staining intensities of 2d-sds-page gels  <cit> . so, the incubation of smtnl1-tmb with different molar ratios of tpm prior to the addition of cam-sepharose was used to reveal additional information about the character of the protein complex formation. increasing the amounts of tpm resulted in a notable decrease in the binding of smtnl1-tmb to apo-cam-sepharose . moreover, there was minimal influence of increased tpm on the binding of phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb in the apo-cam condition . the small inhibitory effect of increasing tpm concentration on the amount of smtnl1-tmb retained on ca-cam sepharose suggests a greater affinity of smtnl1-tmb for ca-cam over tpm . however, distinct effects were observed for ca-cam binding of phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb under conditions of high tpm . in this case, the phosphorylation of smtnl1-tmb suppressed ca-cam binding potential in favour of tpm.fig.  <dig> smtnl <dig> phosphorylation precludes ca-cam-binding in favour of tpm-binding under conditions of high tpm content. smtnl1-tmb or phosphorylated smtnl1-tmb  was pre-incubated with the indicated molar ratio of purified α/β tpm dimer. the mixtures were then added to cam-sepharose in the absence , or presence  of calcium. after extensive washing, bound smtnl1-tmb was eluted and detected with coomassie staining of sds-page gels. the band density was quantified and binding expressed as percentage of maximum binding within each condition. all experiments are n =  <dig> and were analyzed by one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc analysis. different letters indicate significant differences among groups 




discussion
phosphorylation events are known to regulate binding of cam to target proteins. several examples of phosphorylation within or near cam-binding domains  have been reported in the literature, including but not limited to smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase  <cit> , marks protein  <cit> , plasma membrane ca2+-atpase  <cit> , endothelial nitric oxide synthase   <cit> , and the ca2+-dependent k+-channel  <cit> . cam binds to its targets by wrapping around a short amphipathic helix within the cbd  <cit> , thus the phosphorylation of residues within a cbd can disrupt cam interactions even if the ser/thr residues subject to phosphorylation are not necessarily required for cam binding  <cit> . herein, we describe a novel incidence where phosphorylation regulates cam binding to a target protein. in this case, the pka-dependent phosphorylation of smtnl <dig> at ser <dig> modulates both ca- and apo-cam binding. ser <dig> lies well upstream of the core hydrophobic residues within cbd <dig> required for ca-cam-binding . it is likely that the distance between ser <dig> and the hydrophobic patch of cbd <dig> is too distant for phosphorylation to directly block ca-cam docking. this agrees with our observation that the rate of pka-dependent phosphorylation at ser <dig> was not influenced when apo- or ca-cam was included in the kinase assay . we have previously demonstrated that intramolecular interactions between the c-terminal iq motif  and the intrinsically disordered region  influence apo-cam binding  <cit> . furthermore, a portion of the n-terminal intrinsically disordered region forms intramolecular contacts with the globular c-terminal calponin homology  domain  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable that phosphorylation within the n-terminal region has far-reaching effects in the c-terminal domain and can attenuate both ca- and apo-cam binding potentials.

the phosphorylation of smtnl1-tmb enhanced the tpm-binding potential in both pull down studies and by confirming spr assays. inconsequential amounts of nonspecific tpm-binding were found with cam-sepharose, and its binding was not influenced by the presence of smtnl1-tmb, irrespective of phosphorylation or calcium. thus, we conclude that a heterotrimeric complex of smtnl1-tmb, cam and tpm was not formed under any of the binding conditions employed. since no heterotrimer was generated, we suggest that tpm and ca-cam compete for a similar binding site on smtnl1-tmb. this conclusion is further supported by the fact that the binding surfaces for cam and tpm overlap on smtnl <dig>  indeed, only very weak binding of tpm is observed with the isolated ch domain  in the absence of the intrinsically-disordered upstream sequence   <cit> .

our findings place smtnl <dig> in a position to influence both ca2+/cam-regulated contractile events and ca2+ desensitization pathways in smooth muscle. depending on intracellular calcium concentration and cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase activation, smtnl <dig> is predicted to cycle between tpm-bound and ca-cam-bound complexes. the impact of smtnl <dig> on smooth muscle contractile processes may be via its binding partners and associations with the contractile filament. in its dephosphorylated state smtnl <dig> has weaker affinity for tpm and would be more likely to associate with cam. with an increase in intracellular calcium due to a contractile signal, ca-cam could bind to smtnl <dig> and initiate the dissociation of the complex from the thin filament. unphosphorylated smtnl <dig> can inhibit myosin light chain phosphatase  activity in vitro  <cit> , so the release of smtnl <dig> could attenuate mlcp-dependent dephosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain . conversely, smtnl <dig> phosphorylation during calcium desensitization of smooth muscle could provide enhanced binding to tpm and restrict binding of cam in the apo-state, securing phosphorylated smtnl <dig> with tpm on the thin filament. the weak binding modes of smtnl <dig> with apo-cam might not possess enough stability to occur in vivo  <cit> . while the physiological significance of smtnl <dig> association with the contractile filament in situ has not been investigated, we speculate that the protein may act in analogous manners to caldesmon or calponin on actin-myosin cross bridge cycling. calponin interacts with many cytoskeleton and related proteins  and functions as an inhibitor of actin-activated myosin atpase  <cit> . the binding of ca-cam dissociates calponin from the actin filament to facilitate smooth muscle contraction  <cit> . calponin can also be phosphorylated in response to cyclic nucleotide signals to cause a reduced affinity for the thin filament  <cit> . caldesmon is another actin filament-associated regulatory protein; it also binds to tpm and regulates cross-bridge cycling in a ca-cam dependent manner  <cit> . a detailed physiological analysis of the cam- and tpm-interactions of smtnl <dig> and their functional implications are required to provide a clear description of role of smtnl <dig> in smooth muscle contractility. further investigation will be needed to verify the role of smtnl <dig> in fine-tuning thin filament dynamics.

CONCLUSIONS
herein, we provide evidence that calcium availability increases cam association with smtnl <dig>  and cam and tropomyosin binding to smtnl <dig> are mutually exclusive events. moreover, smtnl <dig> binding to cam is reduced by phosphorylation of ser <dig> while binding to tropomyosin is enhanced. we propose a model whereby smtnl <dig> can exist in distinct complexes with either tpm or cam, depending on availability of calcium and activity of pka. this switching mechanism could aid in the fine-tuning of smooth muscle contraction.
