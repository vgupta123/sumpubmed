BACKGROUND
one mechanism species have evolved to adapt to variations on a molecular level is epigenetic modification, such as dna methylation. dna methylation is one mechanism that regulates gene expression in eukaryotes  <cit> . in mammals it is essential for embryonic viability due to its function in developmental processes such as imprinting, x chromosome inactivation, cell differentiation, gene regulation, and transposon silencing  <cit> . dysregulated dna methylation was found in the etiology of many diseases, including cancer  <cit> . the methylation pattern is mitotically and sometimes even meiotically heritable  <cit> . its pattern is stably maintained, but can also be very flexible, as in response to environmental changes. dna methylation is the enzymatic addition of a -ch <dig> group to the 5’carbon site of cytosines  <cit>  and occurs in mammals mainly at cg dinucleotide sites , of which 70-80% are methylated . in rare cases methylation also occurs at chg and chh trinucleotide sites . clusters of cgs, called cpg islands   <cit>  are, however, mostly unmethylated  <cit> . in the vertebrate genome about 70% of all promoters are associated with cgis.

in general, methylation of promoters causes transcriptional silencing  <cit> , as they become less accessible to transcription factors. this effect is enhanced by members of the methyl-cpg-binding domain protein family  whose binding to methylated sites induces conformational changes to the chromatin  <cit> .

several methods have been developed to study dna methylation on a genomic scale, each having strengths and weaknesses . these methods mostly incorporate next generation sequencing  and are classified in bisulfite-treatment based methods and enrichment techniques  <cit> .

so far, studies on dna methylation were mostly restricted to model organisms as these are easier to study because required genomic data is available. here we present a strategy to study the genome-wide dna methylation pattern in the wild guinea pig cavia aperea, a mammal species that has not yet been genomically sequenced. the strategy is based on utilizing the genome sequence of a close relative  and on an enhanced coverage of methylated regions. in the first step, we generated a ‘c. aperea reference sequence’ whose coverage was increased specifically for methylated sequences. to further study cytosine methylation we established a method which involves the enrichment of methylated sequences using mbd <dig>  bisulfite treatment, and ngs, which we named ‘methylated dna-enrichment-bisulfite-sequencing ’. the method permits the detection of cytosine methylation at single-base resolution yet at affordable costs. using mebs we obtained methylome data, comparable with those obtained in model-mammals  <cit> .

RESULTS
cavia aperea reference sequence
to generate a new reference sequence for c. aperea, we first sequenced two pooled illumina mate-pair  libraries of two individuals . the sequences were mapped onto the c. porcellus reference sequence , revealing a 4-fold average genomic coverage . to increase coverage at sites of interest, we mapped in a second step also sequences of six methylation site-enriched paired-end  libraries  onto c. porcellus, thereby enhancing the average coverage of methylated regions to 333×. thus, by combining these two library types in the mapping process we generated a methylation site enhanced reference sequence of cavia aperea . we then annotated  <dig>  genes  of which  <dig>  were protein coding. additionally, we annotated  <dig>  cgis.table  <dig>

methylated dna - enriched pe libraries
we enriched for methylated dna  from total genomic dna  using either mbd <dig>  protein or an antibody directed against mcs  . the mbd <dig> protein bound ~1/ <dig> of the sheared. we prepared four mbd libraries  and performed sequencing . to increase the number of genomic regions covered, we used two different tissues  to profit from cell-specific methylation patterns. reads covered about  <dig> % of the reference sequence of c. aperea with an average coverage of  <dig>  ×.

to test for reproducibility, we compared genomic sequencing depth among the mbd2-seq reads. we found a slightly stronger correlation of the sequencing depth between the mbd2-seqs that derived from the same tissue  than for those derived from different tissue material . the high correlation of coverage indicates high reproducibility, the slightly higher correlation of the same tissue material stems from the tissue-specific methylomes.

as the reads of all four mbd2-pe libraries  were subsequently combined, we will henceforth generalize them as mbd2-seq. compared with mbd <dig> reads, medip reads  had a lower coverage of just  <dig> × refraining us from analyzing them any further. we did, however, incorporate these reads into the final reference sequence to further enhance sequence information.

mebs data
mebs was performed on two c. aperea mbd2-pe libraries . here we used testis dna, but any mammalian tissue material is applicable. for both c. aperea libraries, 99% of mebs reads passed the quality threshold of q <dig> and 96% even passed q <dig>  we used q <dig> data for downstream analysis. after filtering and trimming, we successfully obtained  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> clean reads for the two libraries, respectively . procedure reproducibility was shown by a strong positive correlation  between the fragment coverage of both mebs libraries as well as between the methylation ratios of all c positions covered in both libraries . using mebs we were able to check for mbd2-binding specificity. only  <dig> % of c. aperea reference positions covered by mebs were not covered by mbd2-seq, while  <dig> % were covered by both. mbd2-seqs alone covered  <dig> % of all reference positions, while mebs reads alone covered  <dig> % of all reference positions.figure  <dig>

mebs output: quality of clean reads and mapping results per library


clean data and mapped reads were based on q <dig> values. coverage refers to the ‘c. aperea reference sequence’ . the sequencing depth was calculated per covered region.

reference sequence validation
we generated several reference sequences using different combinations of libraries to investigate the relation between cost and benefit of different library preparation and sequencing methods . to check for and ascertain best mapping efficiency, all mebs reads were mapped to those reference sequences using bismark . the highest percentages of mapped mebs reads for both libraries were obtained using the newly generated ‘c. aperea reference sequence’, in spite of its higher n content  compared with c. porcellus .

we also generated a reference from mbd2-seqs without incorporating mp and medip-capture reads. mapping to this reference resulted in similar results as mapping to the new ‘c. aperea reference sequence’ . comparing the numbers of mp reads  and mbd2-seq reads  it became clear that incorporation of mp reads into the reference improved mapping efficiency by only  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, for the two mebs-pe libraries.

these results demonstrate that additional incorporation of non-enriched reads was not mandatory to create the necessary reference sequence and that mbd2-seq reference provided a cost effective alternative for the mebs workflow.

we also compared the positions of the mapped reads among all reference sequences, to see if mappings to different reference sequences were consistent . we found that the positions of mapped reads were highly consistent, regardless of the reference sequence the read was mapped to. the reads of the two mebs-pe libraries mapped with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively to similar positions in the c. aperea and c. porcellus reference sequence, indicating a correct placement of the reads.

dna methylation analysis
for mc determination we focused on reads that mapped uniquely onto the ‘c. aperea reference sequence’. unique mapping rates were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively for the two mebs-pe libraries , whereas 11% and 12% of the reads did not map unambiguously. reads of the two mebs-pe libraries  covered 11% and 9% of the ‘c. aperea reference sequence’ .

we explored the degree of methylation and the locations of mcs. according to the ratio of cgs, chgs, and chhs, the efficiency of bisulfite treatment was ~99% for both mebs-pe libraries. in both libraries ~18% of the detected cytosines were methylated. out of those ~90% were within cg dinucleotides . four mcs per mapped read occurred most often , while less than 1% of cytosines in chh and chg  were methylated, respectively .table  <dig>

the method also allows to identify if non-methylated regions had also been  captured by mbd <dig>  in only  <dig> % of all uniquely mapped mebs-pe reads, all cytosines were converted by bisulfite treatment , indicating a high specificity of mbd <dig> to mdna.

we also investigated genomic regions of interest for their percentage of mcs. cgis , exons and promoters  displayed similar methylation levels, which were either very high  or very low  . intermediate methylation levels were nearly absent. as cgis are a main target of dna methyltransferases we also separately analysed the percentage of mcs in cgis inside and outside of promoter regions and found no obvious difference in the level of methylation between them . out of the  <dig>  cgis annotated in total, only  <dig>  were located in promoter regions. we also found only a few cgis in close proximity to promoters . the vast majority  of cgis was at least  <dig>  base pairs away from a promoter. thus, the low amount of cgis associated with promoters is not an effect of the definition of promoter regions as 2 kb upstream of the transcription start site .figure  <dig>

gene selection for methylation analysis
as proof of principle we looked for paternally expressed imprinted genes in the reads of both mebs-pe libraries. as these genes are known to be regulated by methylation we expected them to be present in the libraries. we also expected both libraries to show similar results because the libraries were from the same type of organ of two coeval male wild guinea pigs, housed under the same conditions and thus serving as biological replicates. as expected, the mebs-pe libraries contained reads of numerous imprinted genes  of which two were analyzed in greater detail: the insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  and the paternally expressed gene  <dig> . we also looked beyond the paternally imprinted genes for additional, strongly methylated genes  of which we chose two to be displayed in greater detail: the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene  and the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha . as expected the methylation patterns of both libraries showed high correlations at these loci  confirming the method’s credibility and reproducibility.figure  <dig>

discussion
main goal
the growing interest in dna methylation as a main epigenetic mechanism involved in the expression of numerous phenotypic traits has also increased the demand for technologies for its characterization. as wild species carry important information of evolutionary adaptational processes, but mostly have not yet been sequenced, technical strategies are required to nevertheless study dna methylation in these species. here we report an efficient strategy to study genome-wide cytosine methylation patterns at nucleotide-specific resolution in the wild guinea pig cavia aperea. this was done by the generation of a ‘c. aperea reference sequence’ and the incorporation of mdna-enriched sequences to increase coverage of those specific sites for methylome studies. with such reference, we set the base to perform bisulfite sequencing of mc-enriched regions, using the methodical approach presented here, mebs. mebs is the succession of mdna-enrichment, bisulfite treatment, and next-generation sequencing . we showed that combining these methods is an efficient way to study methylation patterns.

cytosine methylation
in total about 20% of all covered cytosines of the c. aperea genome were methylated in testis cells. as shown for other mammals and thus expected, these mcs were predominantly located within cg dinucleotides of which ~90% were at a methylated state. compared with the 70-80% of cg dinucleotides being methylated in humans  <cit> , this proportion is higher, which likely stems from the usage of a methylation site enriched sequence causing a slightly biased over-all methylation rate. in c. aperea chg and chh sites were rarely methylated. it is known from humans, that chg and chh methylation disappears with the induction of cell differentiation in embryonic and other stem cells  <cit> . about 25% of mcs are in a non-cg context, and become demethylated upon induced stem cell differentiation and remethylated in induced pluripotent cells. an exception was found in human and mice brain cells, where non-cg methylation is highly conserved in regions with low cpg-density, and likewise to mcg represses gene transcription  <cit> .

methylated cgs in genomic regions
in the wild guinea pig, we found cgs in exons to be highly methylated . this pattern was expected as it is strongly conserved among plants and mammals  <cit> .

when considering the difference in genome size, the number of cgis in c. aperea  was about 40% smaller than the number of cgis in a human genome . in the vertebrate genome about 70% of all promoters are associated with cgis  <cit> . among human and mouse about 40% of promoter cgis are methylated at orthologous genomic regions  <cit> . although in c. aperea cgis and promoters had similar methylation densities, most mcs were found in non-promoter cgis . those non-promoter cgis may either belong to still unknown gene promoters  <cit> , may represent additional regulatory units of the genome, or are part of retrotransposons like short interspersed nuclear elements , which in humans represent 10% of the genome  <cit> .

most wild guinea pig promoters showed low methylation levels. the majority of the regions analyzed were either hypo  or hypermethylated , potentially indicating a regulatory function of methylation in gene expression. this conclusion, however, needs to be viewed cautiously, as the method itself is targeted at sequencing fragments containing mcs, thereby influencing the detection ratio of hypo-, meso, and hypermethylated reads. the detection of hypomethylated fragments at high frequency, however, gives our general conclusion plausibility.

by investigating specific genes in two biological replicates , we observed similar and strongly correlated methylation patterns, indicating that the detected methylation patterns were not arbitrary but rather of general importance.

advantages of the mebs method
the main advantage is that it enables the easy incorporation of methyl-enrichment results to track methylation with nucleotide-specific resolution without whole genome sequences available.

by combining the data from the methylation-site enriched libraries  with the data obtained after bisulfite treatment, the already existing enrichment reads can be used to create a mdna-enriched sequence that the mebs-pe reads can be mapped onto. methylation ratios can be easily calculated  and non-methylated “false positive” reads that were unspecifically captured by the mbd <dig> protein can be identified as such.

it is possible to perform mebs with any mdna enrichment kit, as well as with single and paired end  library preparation kits. we used pe sequencing, because it provides sequence information from the forward and the reverse strand. the two matched reads gave a greater genomic range , which can be mapped more accurately.

using mebs, different methylation states can be studied easily, such as cell type-specific methylation pattern and/or effects of environmental changes on methylation patterns. after identification of loci that are methylated in one state but not the other using the enriched methylated fragments, cytosine-specific methylation at those loci can be measured, permitting to determine hypo and hypermethylation, and allowing to detect minor changes among states within captured loci.

reference sequences
in the present set-up we benefited from the existing genome sequence of a close species, the domestic guinea pig , which diverged from the wild guinea pig  just ~ <dig>  years ago). the high similarity between these species certainly facilitated the establishment of mebs. however, with the speedily growing pool of high quality mammalian genome sequences, the method should be transferrable to numerous other mammalian species.

among all our mapping approaches onto different references , the ‘c. aperea reference sequence’ yielded the best mapping results for the reads of the two mebs-pe libraries. despite the fact that the newly generated ‘c. aperea reference sequence’ had 22% ns instead of only 2% ns in the c. porcellus reference sequence, we still achieved a mapping rate improvement of  <dig> % for mebs-pe_ <dig>  and of  <dig> % for mebs-pe_ <dig> . the preparation of a mdna-enriched sequence is a cost-effective, yet accurate way to produce a reference sequence for dna methylation studies.

interestingly, the reference sequence generated by mbd2-seq only, still gave a better mapping result than the c. porcellus reference sequence we used as initial reference sequence . compared with the low coverage of mp reads  and the even lower coverage of medip-capture reads , which only led to a low increase in mapping efficiency, the best results were obtained using mbd2-captured reads  and mebs-pe reads of the same sample material. therefore, the generation of a mbd2-seq is efficient and additional sequencing is not mandatory to obtain reliable results for the mebs pipeline. this aspect could potentially reduce a study’s processing time and experimental costs. it should be noted that although incorporation of mp reads had  no effect on the mapping results, it decreased the number of ns in the newly generated ‘c. aperea reference sequence’.

dependence on mbd <dig> protein
a comparison of four commercially available mbd-based enrichment kits  <cit>  found that the mbd <dig> protein based methylminer™ kit  gives the highest dna yield, as well as the most “non-duplicated uniquely mapped fragments” . the same study, however, also stated that methylminer™ also captures unmethylated sequences, wherefore it ranked last in sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . although we did not test other capture kits, our results clearly showed that methylminer™ kit captured fragments even with as little as just a single mc present , demonstrating a very high sensitivity to methylated sites. in our study, specificity was very high as well, as only a total of ~ <dig> % of captured mebs fragments were unmethylated.

the high capture yield of the methylminer™ kit also permitted capturing of the required amounts of dna recommended for bisulfite treatment and ngs from a small amount of sample material.

the different sensitivities of the kits  <cit>  stem most likely from the mbd protein included within the kit. the mbd protein family in mammals consists of mbd <dig>  mbd <dig>  mbd <dig>  mbd <dig> and the methyl-cpg-binding protein mecp <dig>  <cit> . in general, mbd <dig>  mbd <dig>  mbd <dig> as well as mecp <dig> proteins mainly bind to methyl-dense cg-rich positions. but mbd <dig> and mbd <dig> may also bind to unmethylated targets  <cit>  if these regions are low in cg density and dna methylation, but co-located with transcriptionally active histone modification sites, such as h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac. mbd <dig> also shows binding-specificity to active promoters and enhancer elements  <cit>  where it induces conformational changes to the chromatin  <cit> . those findings imply an additional function of mbd <dig> within the dna methylation pathway. in our case, the broader spectrum of sites that mbd <dig> recognizes provided the advantage of a broader spectrum of sequence information.

comparison with other methods
bisulfite sequencing of whole genomes remains the “gold standard” but is still very costly, creates huge amounts of data, which, as they consist of mainly non-methylated sequences, are of less interest when addressing the methylome. both reasons are prohibitive for greater sample numbers. mebs reduces cost and output of  sequencing data while still covering the methylated genomic positions of interest.

mebs also offers an alternative to the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing  method. although rrbs also reduces the output of genomic sequences and includes bisulfite treatment  <cit> , it relies on the application of restriction enzymes and fragments are size-selected according to their suitability for sequencing instead for biological reasons, creating high amounts of products to be excluded. nevertheless, rrbs is an efficient method to address dna methylation on a genomic scale  <cit> . depending on the restriction enzyme used in rrbs, the amount of dna to be sequenced is reduced to ~1-9% of the genome  <cit> . our mebs method, however, covered between 9%  and 11% of the genome of c. aperea . furthermore, while the use of restriction enzymes in rrbs  enriches fragments with high cg content such as cgis, it widely neglects other methylome relevant regions. mebs selects methylated regions regardless of their origin or their surrounding nucleic sequences. therefore we were able to address genes as well as promoter regions with diverse content of mcs . additionally, rrbs protocols are currently only established for single-end library sequencing. we used paired-end sequencing, which in general increases the coverage and thus accuracy of each sequenced fragment.

parallel to the establishment of our method, a similar approach called “methylcap-seq” was published  <cit> . despite their similar experimental setups, both methods differ in the mbd protein used, and more importantly, in their sequencing approach. like rrbs, methylcap-seq is based on single-end library sequencing with a read length of 36 bp, whereas our method is based on 90 bp long reads. using paired-end sequencing we have a ~3× larger final fragment size of 134 bp.

but why not use commercially available array systems? these arrays limit the results to predefined regions such as cgis or promoters and exclude other regions  <cit> . furthermore, such arrays depend on known sequence information for the species of interest or for closely related species in conjunction with a custom-array design. the first option would lead to a loss of non-orthologous sequences, and simultaneously might cause false positive results by mismatch-hybridization. the latter is time-consuming, costly and restrictive.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we describe 1) the generation of a whole genome sequence of the wild guinea pig by applying the genome of its sister species and 2) mebs as an efficient and reproducible method for dna methylation analysis. the combined strategy can be applied to increase the understanding of epigenetic modification, such as gene × environment interactions in wild life.
