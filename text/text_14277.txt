BACKGROUND
anti-cancer vaccines are designed to break tolerance to self and stimulate strong and durable anti-tumor immunity. administering defined tumor-derived epitopes to cancer patients for the activation of helper and cytotoxic t cells has been shown to enhance anti-cancer immune responses in vivo and in some cases to lead to objective clinical responses  <cit> . to optimize the efficacy of peptide-based anti-cancer vaccines, combinatorial approaches stimulating both innate and adaptive immunity are now being clinically evaluated  <cit> . mature dendritic cells  are key players for eliciting such responses, as they present antigens to t cells and provide the necessary co-stimulatory signals and cytokines favoring the efficient activation of tumor-reactive immune cells  <cit> . dc maturation can be induced in vivo upon admixing and co-administering immunogenic peptides with adjuvants, but to date this strategy has been proven successful only when vaccinating against common pathogens  <cit> . in cancer patients, the presence of tumor-associated suppressive factors impairs endogenous dc functions  <cit> , a condition that can be bypassed only by the adoptive transfer of ex vivo matured immunocompetent dcs  <cit> .

adjuvants comprise, among others, toll-like receptor  agonists, the majority of which reportedly promotes dc maturation  <cit> . a subcategory thereof are molecules with so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns , such as cpg oligodeoxynucleotides that signal through tlr- <dig>  <cit> , poly-i:c ligating tlr- <dig>  <cit> , imiquimod, a tlr- <dig> agonist  <cit>  and monophosphoryl lipid a, a tlr- <dig> agonist  <cit> . a second group consists of molecules possessing damage-associated molecular patterns  or “alarmins”. high mobility group box  <dig>  protein and heat shock protein   <dig> are notable examples of damps. both proteins are strictly intracellular under normal physiological conditions, but when excreted eg. from damaged cells, signal through tlr- <dig>  sensitize dcs and promote adaptive immune responses  <cit> . this functional dualism, in and out of the cell, also characterizes prothymosin alpha .

in normal living cells, protα is localized in the nucleus where it controls the cell cycle and promotes cell proliferation. released from dead cells, extracellular protα acquires multi-functional immunomodulatory properties  <cit> . we and others have previously shown that protα upregulates the expression of irak- <dig> in human monocytes  <cit> , ligates tlr- <dig> on murine macrophages and signals through myd88-dependent and independent pathways  <cit> . similar to its immunoreactive decapeptide protα  <cit> , it upregulates the expression of hla-dr  <cit> , cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> and promotes maturation of human dcs in vitro <cit> .

here, we show that dcs matured ex vivo in the presence of protα or protα are not only phenotypically but also functionally competent, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce th1-type immune responses in the presence of tumor-associated immunogenic epitopes of the oncoprotein her-2/neu. dcs matured with protα or protα prime naïve cd8-positive  t cells to exert her-2/neu peptide-specific cytotoxicity and cd4+ t cells to proliferate in a peptide-dependent manner. finally, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that both protα and its decapeptide protα likely signal via tlr- <dig> in human dcs.

RESULTS
phenotype of and cytokine production by protα- or protα-matured dcs
we have previously shown that protα and protα efficiently mature human dcs in vitro, as indicated by the induction of surface expression of established dc-markers to levels comparable to those induced by lipopolysacharide   <cit>  or tumor necrosis factor -α . as shown in figure  <dig>  lps-matured dcs significantly upregulated the expression of hla-dr, cd11b, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  to levels comparable to tnf-α-matured dcs . similarly, both agents caused a reduction of cd <dig> expression. in agreement with our previous study  <cit> , idcs matured with either protα or its decapeptide presented a similar phenotype to lps- or tnf-α-matured dcs, upregulating the expression of all co-stimulatory molecules  and downregulating cd <dig> .

in conjunction with their phenotype, functionally competent mature dcs secrete pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . therefore, we assessed the production of tnf-α, interleukin - <dig> and il- <dig> from idcs and mature dcs and determined the il-12:il- <dig> ratio. we present these data because high tnf-α levels, as well as a balance between il-12:il- <dig> in favor of il- <dig> have been proposed to promote th1-polarization  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  idcs produced low amounts of all three cytokines, whereas mature dc supernatants collected  <dig> h after addition of lps or tnf-α were rich in tnf-α and il- <dig>  compared to idcs, higher tnf-α and il- <dig> levels were also found in supernatants of cultures of dcs matured with protα and protα. although the absolute concentrations of cytokines varied among the differentially matured dcs, their overall cytokine-production patterns were comparable. most importantly, the mean il-12:il- <dig> ratios were similar -matured dcs, respectively). these data suggest that the peptides bias immunoreactivity towards a pro-inflammatory th1-type of response.

finally, in the presence of a blocking antibody against tlr- <dig> , lower amounts of cytokines were secreted by lps-, protα- and protα-matured dcs, but not tnf-α-matured dcs. notably, a-tlr- <dig> reduced the levels of lps- and protα-induced il- <dig> production by  <dig> and 47%, respectively , implying that il- <dig> production by lps- and protα-matured dcs is at least partially, tlr-4-dependent  <cit> .

protα and protα lead to th1-polarized tumor peptide-reactive immune response
as optimally matured dcs prime antigen-specific cd4+ and cd8+ t cell activation and proliferation of naive t cells  <cit> , we next assessed whether protα- and protα-matured dcs are functionally competent, i.e., induce in vitro the selective expansion of tumor antigen-specific t cells.

monocyte-derived dcs matured for  <dig> h with protα, protα or tnf-α  were pulsed with the hla-a <dig> and hla-dr4-restricted her-2/neu  and her-2/neu  epitopes, and used to prime autologous naïve t cells isolated from the peripheral blood of hla-a2+/dr4+ healthy donors. t cells were restimulated twice, at weekly intervals, with similarly matured autologous dcs. twelve hours after the third stimulation their production of tnf-α, interferon -γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> was analysed. figure  <dig> shows the percentages of ifn-γ+, il-2+, il-4+ and il-10+ cd4+ t cells from one representative donor of  <dig> tested with similar results . in the presence of unpulsed tnf-α-matured dcs, only a low percentage of cd4+ t cells produced ifn-γ , which was significantly increased  in the presence of the her-2/neu peptides. an analogous increase in the percentage of ifn-γ-producing cells was also recorded in cd4+ t cells stimulated with protα- or protα-matured dcs in the presence of the same peptides . the percentages of il-2-producing cd4+ t cells in all groups were also significantly enhanced upon stimulation with her-2/neu peptide-pulsed dcs -matured dcs, compared to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the respective unpulsed groups; figure 3). a similar enhancement was also seen for tnf-α-producing cd4+ t cells . in contrast, production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> was only marginally increased when cd4+ t cells were stimulated with her-2/neu peptide-pulsed dcs, regardless of the factor used for dc maturation . specifically, the percentage of cd4+ t cells producing il- <dig> was increased from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % among t cells stimulated with peptide-pulsed tnf-α-matured dcs, from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the proαα- and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the protα-matured dc groups. a minor enhancement was also recorded for il- <dig> production; il-10+ cells increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the tnf-α-, from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the proαα- and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the protα-matured dc cultures without and with her-2/neu peptides, respectively. il- <dig> production exhibited a similar pattern of marginal increase in cd4+ t cells stimulated in the presence of all matured antigen-pulsed dcs . these data suggest that protα- and protα-matured dcs are immunocompetent and in the presence of specific tumor antigenic epitopes, favor the in vitro production of pro-inflammatory , rather than anti-inflammatory cytokines  and il- <dig> by cd4+ t cells, inducing th1-type immune responses.

protα- and protα-matured dcs stimulate tumor peptide-specific cd8+ t cell responses
cell-mediated immunity requires initial collaboration between th <dig> cd4+ and cd8+ t cells  <cit> . thus, we next investigated whether protα- and protα-matured dcs can elicit tumor peptide-specific cytotoxic t cell immune responses.

cd8+ t cells recovered from the same stimulation cultures as aforementioned were assessed for the intracellular production of tnf-α. as shown in figure 4a, they also exhibited a similar pattern of enhanced cytokine production in the presence of her-2/neu peptides as did cd4+ t cells. the percentage of tnf-α+ cells was increased from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  when t cells were stimulated with tnf-α-matured dcs, and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for protα- and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for protα-matured dcs . in addition and in accordance with the results recorded for cd4+ t cells, il-2- and ifn-γ-producing cd8+ t cells were also increased in the presence of peptide-pulsed dcs in the cultures, whereas differences in the percentages of il-10-producing cd8+ t cells were only marginal .

the same cells were assessed for the expression of cd107a, as a surrogate marker for cytotoxicity  <cit> . in the absence of her- <dig>  a low percentage of cd8+ t cells stimulated with tnf-α-matured dcs expressed cd107a , which increased when cells were stimulated with her-2-pulsed dcs . similar cd107a upregulation was observed in cd8+ t cells stimulated with protα- and protα-matured her-2-pulsed dcs . since tnf-α mediates target cell damage and cd107a-expressing cd8+ t cells are cytotoxic  <cit> , our results suggest that protα- and protα-matured dcs efficiently activate cd8+ cytotoxic t cells, which were able to kill targets presenting the immunogenic epitope versus which they were primed.

cytotoxic activity was verified by using 51cr-labeled hla-a2+ t <dig> cells loaded with her- <dig> or an irrelevant epitope, tyrosinase . cd8+ t cells thrice stimulated with peptide-pulsed tnf-α-, protα- or protα-matured dcs were coincubated with these peptide-loaded t <dig> targets. the results showed that cd8+ t cell mean cytotoxicity against non-peptide loaded t <dig> targets did not exceed 30% in any group -matured dcs; figure 4b), whereas her-2-loaded t <dig> targets were lysed twice as efficiently by cd8+ t cells recovered from all stimulation cultures -matured dcs; figure 4b). cytotoxicity against t <dig> targets loaded with tyr was low and in no instance exceeded 30%. these cytotoxic responses were significantly decreased by monoclonal antibody  to mhc class i molecules, suggesting that the cd8+ t cells generated by our stimulation protocol are mhc class i-restricted and her-2-specific .

polyfunctionality of her-2–specific cd8+ t cells
based on previous studies associating t cell polyfunctionality with high ifn-γ production and the quality of the elicited responses  <cit> , we carried out a functional analysis of the her-2-specific cd8+ t cells generated in these experiments. using flowjo software, we analyzed their ability to produce effector cytokines  and to degranulate . quantifying the fraction of the responsive cd8+ t cells producing any one , any two , any three  or all four  mediators, we observed that approximately a mean ~16% of the responsive cd8+ t cells were 2+ cells, regardless of the agent used to mature the dcs that stimulated them ; figure 5). in all experimental groups, 3+ cells were also detected in increased percentages ). in contrast, very few 4+ cells were detected under any conditions. taken together, these data suggest that protα- or protα-matured dcs were able to induce polyfunctional  cd8+ peptide-specific t cell responses at least as well as tnf-α-matured dcs.

t cells stimulated with protα- or protα-matured dcs proliferate in response to the her- <dig> epitope
t cell proliferation was assessed by the incorporation of 3h-thymidine. her-2-sensitized t cells coincubated with her-2-, tyrosinase -pulsed or unpulsed dcs, specifically proliferated in response only to the her-2/neu epitope . protα- and protα-matured dcs showed relatively high mean stimulation indices  , comparable to those recorded for tnf-α-matured dcs . addition of mab to mhc class ii molecules reduced mean s.is in all groups ). these results suggest that following our in vitro culture protocol, peptide-reactive t cells are generated, which proliferate only in a her-2-dependent mhc class ii-restricted manner.

protα and protα induce the maturation of dcs via triggering tlr-4
we have previously reported that stimulation of human monocytes with protα upregulated irak- <dig>  a protein kinase involved in tlr downstream signaling  <cit> , whereas mosoian et al.  <cit>  showed that protα ligates tlr- <dig> and signals through both trif- and myd88-dependent pathways. to determine whether tlr- <dig> is triggered by our peptides, we studied the kinetics of tlr- <dig> surface expression on protα and protα-stimulated dcs. immature dcs  and dcs matured with lps , protα or protα for  <dig> min,  <dig> min,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h were analyzed by flow cytometry. the percentage of surface tlr- <dig> expression over time is presented in figure  <dig>  maturation of dcs with lps led to an early  decrease of tlr- <dig> expression  due to internalization  <cit> , and a subsequent increase from  <dig> to  <dig> h  <cit> . at  <dig> h post-lps addition, tlr- <dig> expression was lower and comparable to that of idcs . protα and protα, marginally downregulated tlr- <dig> expression at  <dig> min and, similarly to lps, transiently increased it from  <dig> to  <dig> h. as with lps-matured dcs, basal levels of tlr- <dig> expression were detected at  <dig> h post-maturation. the similar kinetics of tlr- <dig> expression in lps-, protα- and protα-matured dcs is consistent with the notion that the two peptides interact with tlr- <dig> 

to extend these findings, we next investigated the intracellular expression levels of three adaptor molecules that participate in signaling pathways downstream of tlr- <dig>  namely trif, an adaptor molecule common to tlr- <dig> and - <dig> signaling; tirap, a signaling adaptor common to tlr- <dig>  and -4; and myd <dig>  a molecule upregulated upon ligation of all tlrs except tlr- <dig>  <cit> . we specifically selected these three adaptors because this constellation is unique to tlr- <dig> activation. total cell extracts from idcs and dcs matured with lps, protα or protα for  <dig> h and  <dig> h were immunoblotted . upon densitometric quantification of each protein band detected, expression relative to gapdh was calculated. as shown in figure 7b, addition of lps led to a significant ~2- <dig> fold increase of the expression of all three adaptors within  <dig> h  relative to idcs . at  <dig> h post-addition of lps, expression of all adaptors was decreased and again comparable to idcs . a similar trend of increased expression was also observed  <dig> h after addition of protα  or protα , although in the latter case, the detected protein levels were lower. as with lps,  <dig> h after protα or protα dc-stimulation, the expression of trif, tirap and myd <dig> was reduced and was similar to idcs. these data, in conjunction with the cytokine profile shown in figure  <dig>  suggest that lps, protα, and possibly also protα, activate dcs at least partly through one common tlr-4-dependent intracellular signaling pathway.

discussion
we have previously shown that human monocyte-derived idcs activated in vitro with protα or its immunoreactive decapeptide, protα, acquire a mature dc phenotype  <cit> . here, we show that dc maturation induced by protα or protα promotes the secretion of il- <dig>  rather than il- <dig>  from these cells. thus, both protα- and protα-matured dcs possess immunostimulatory properties appropriate for the efficient activation of t cells, through their enhanced antigen-presenting capacity , the increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules  and the secretion of inflammatory mediators , recently proposed to act as signal  <dig> for optimizing effector t cell functions  <cit> .

we assessed whether these ex vivo generated dcs can present tumor-associated immunogenic peptides to autologous t cells, along with the appropriate signals for their activation. we pulsed dcs with one mhc class i- and one class ii-restricted immunodominant epitope from the oncoprotein her-2/neu, her- <dig> and her-2/neu, respectively  <cit> . our results show that protα- or protα-matured her-2/neu peptide-pulsed dcs favor the generation of th1-type immune responses in vitro, by polarizing cd4+ t cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. this cytokine milieu, characterized by high levels of ifn-γ and il- <dig>  results in the generation of strong cd8+ t cell responses  <cit> , as we also observed. indeed, cd8+ effectors recovered from the same stimulation cultures exhibited a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile similar to the cd4+ t cells  and enhanced her-2-specific mhc class i-restricted cytotoxicity. of interest, a high percentage of the peptide-specific cd8+ t cells generated in our stimulation cultures were polyfunctional, a quality reportedly associated with superior t cell performance  <cit> . these findings, in conjunction with the observed enhancement of her-2-specific t cell proliferation, suggest that in the presence of tumor antigenic peptides, protα- and protα-matured dcs efficiently promote the expansion of peptide-specific t cells.

different dc-stimulating agents, including tlr ligands, have long been and still are being explored to optimize the immunostimulatory properties of dcs  <cit> . although it was initially proposed that tlrs recognized only pamps, accumulating evidence to date suggests that tlrs also bind and respond to endogenous ligands released during tissue injury and inflammation, termed damps or “alarmins”  <cit> . most prominent among the alarmins are hmgb <dig>  members of the hsp family and granulysin  <cit> , all of which mature and activate dcs in vitro and bias immune responses towards a th1-type, when used as vaccine adjuvants in vivo <cit> . we and others have previously shown that protα promotes antigen-specific adaptive immune responses  <cit>  and based on the data presented herein, we now identify protα as an alarmin. moreover, in line with data on immunoreactive peptide-fragments derived from either hmgb <dig>  or hsp <dig> , we show that the immunologically active site of protα, the decapeptide protα  <cit> , also favors th1-polarization and induces her-2/neu peptide-specific immune responses.

to suggest a possible molecular mechanism underlying the effect of protα and protα, and considering recent data from ourselves and others  <cit> , we investigated whether tlr- <dig> expressed on human mature dcs is triggered by protα or protα. our results show that protα- or protα-induced dc maturation was associated with modulation of tlr- <dig> surface expression. moreover, the expression of three tlr-4-associated intracellular adaptors, trif, tirap and myd <dig>  was promptly  increased in protα- or protα-matured dcs, providing indirect evidence that the adjuvant activity of protα and protα most likely involves tlr- <dig>  our data are in agreement with those of mosoian et al.  <cit> , showing that in murine macrophages protα signals through the myd88- and the trif-dependent pathways inducing tnf-α and type i ifn production, respectively. tlr ligation is a common mechanism of action, shared by different damps. tlr- <dig> and - <dig> are involved in hmgb <dig> signaling in vitro <cit> , and several hsps, including hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> also act as tlr- <dig> agonists  <cit> . our results add to these observations, suggesting that both protα and its shorter immunoactive decapeptide likely signal through tlr- <dig>  the ambiguities raised as to whether protα and protα share a common mechanism of action on dcs with lps, could be attributed to:  inadequate internalization of tlr- <dig> by monocyte-derived human dcs, which reportedly are cd14low . indeed, stimulation of cd14high human monocytes and monocyte-derived human macrophages  with protα or protα, induced the rapid cd14-dependent endocytosis of tlr- <dig>  with kinetics similar to the response to lps ;  differential requirements for tlr-4-mediated signaling depending on the cell population  and/or cell origin ; and  the involvement of other tlrs  and/or prrs in protα- and protα-induced dc signaling. in support of the latter, a similar phenomenon has been described for hmgb1; the intact protein signals through tlr- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> , and its immunostimulatory peptide hp <dig> acts via tlr- <dig> or even other receptors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken altogether, we show herein that protα and protα optimize immunogenic peptide-pulsed dc functionalities in vitro, possibly by tlr- <dig> triggering. ex vivo education of dcs by protα or protα results in their polarization to type- <dig> dcs, with increased capacity to stimulate tumor peptide-specific t cell responses and to render cytotoxic t cells polyfunctional. if this holds true also in vivo, then these molecules could be promising components of dc-based anti-cancer vaccines.
