BACKGROUND
toxigenic corynebacterium ulcerans was first isolated from a throat lesion of a patient with respiratory diphtheria-like illness in  <dig>  <cit> . these c. ulcerans strains produce a diphtheria toxin, which is similar to that encoded by toxigenic strains of corynebacterium diphtheriae  <cit> . this observation has been explained by the fact that c. ulcerans may harbor lysogenic β-corynephages coding for the diphtheria toxin, which is responsible for the systemic symptoms caused by c. diphtheriae  <cit> . respiratory diphtheria-like illnesses caused by toxigenic c. ulcerans strains are increasingly reported from various industrialized countries  <cit>  and became more common than c. diphtheriae infections in the united kingdom  <cit> . human infections with toxigenic c. ulcerans can be fatal in unvaccinated patients and usually occur in adults, who consumed raw milk  <cit>  or had close contact with domestic animals  <cit> . c. ulcerans has been detected as a commensal not only in domestic animals, but also in wild animals, implying that both groups may serve as reservoirs for the zoonotic transmission of this pathogen  <cit> . several reports demonstrated that toxigenic c. ulcerans strains can be recovered from dairy cows, cats, dogs, goats, pigs, squirrels, free-living otters, dromedary camels, and macaques  <cit> . moreover, c. ulcerans isolates from domestic cats were found to exhibit the predominant ribotypes observed among human clinical isolates, suggesting that strains isolated from cats are a potential reservoir for human infection  <cit> . likewise, ribotyping of c. ulcerans from a female diphtheria patient and a chronic labial ulcer of her dog revealed that both isolates correspond to a single strain  <cit> . this example demonstrates that a distinct c. ulcerans strain may infect different hosts.

beside respiratory diphtheria-like illnesses, c. ulcerans can also cause extrapharyngeal infections in humans, including severe pulmonary infections  <cit> . when c. ulcerans isolates from human clinical specimens not fitting reporting criteria for cases of diphtheria were tested for the presence of diphtheria toxin only a portion of strains were positive for the tox gene encoding diphtheria toxin  <cit> . these observations indicate that additional factors contribute to the virulence of "non-toxigenic" c. ulcerans strains. a second dermonecrotic toxin with similarity to toxic phospholipase d  from corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis appeared to be characteristic of c. ulcerans  <cit> . the common repertoire of potent toxins in c. diphtheriae, c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis particularly highlights the close phylogenetic relationship between these three species  <cit> . despite this apparent relationship, levels of genomic dna relatedness and taxonomic analyses of 16s rdna sequences showed that c. diphtheriae, c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis are separate taxa within a distinct cluster of the genus corynebacterium  <cit> . they can be separated clearly from other pathogenic corynebacteria by chemotaxonomic assays  <cit> . hart et al. proposed that the three species evolved from a common ancestor, which parasitized in ungulates in pre-human times  <cit> .

although c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis are of increasing medical importance, very little knowledge of their lifestyles and associated virulence factors was available until recently. we extended the genetic knowledge of this corynebacterial cluster by publishing the annotation of four complete genome sequences from c. pseudotuberculosis strains isolated from goat, sheep, cattle, and a rare case of human lymphadenitis  <cit> . in conjunction with the previously evaluated genome sequence from the toxigenic c. diphtheriae strain nctc  <dig>  <cit> , a more detailed picture of the closely related corynebacterial pathogens is now available at the genetic and genomic level. in the present study, we established the genome sequences of two c. ulcerans strains  from human and animal specimens to characterize the architecture of the genome and to compare the predicted gene contents and the repertoires of candidate virulence factors.

c. ulcerans  <dig> was recovered from a bronchoalveolar lavage  sample of an 80-year-old woman with rapidly fatal pulmonary infection and a history of chronic bilateral limb ulcers  <cit> . the woman lived in the metropolitan area of rio de janeiro and was hospitalized in coma, with shock and acute respiratory failure. cultures from the bal sample revealed the presence of c. ulcerans, and varying antimicrobial therapies were directed to this potential pathogen. this medical treatment resulted in complete healing of the skin lesions. nevertheless, the cardiorespiratory symptoms of the patient worsened and medical examinations showed evidence of multiple organ failures. the patient died  <dig> days after hospitalization. subsequent toxigenicity tests and pcr assays evaluating the production of diphtheria toxin by c. ulcerans  <dig> were ambiguous and it was concluded that the unusual nature of the pathogen possibly contributed to the patient's death  <cit> .

the second isolate investigated in this study, c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  was obtained from a nasal sample of a 5-year-old female dog kept in an animal shelter in the metropolitan area of rio de janeiro  <cit> . general clinical aspects and laboratory findings revealed this dog as an asymptomatic carrier of c. ulcerans. toxigenicity assays showed the presence of phospholipase d in c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  but were negative for the presence of diphtheria toxin  <cit> . in the following sections, we present the results of the genome sequencing project and the comparative analysis of the genomes from the selected c. ulcerans strains, thereby focusing on the relevant differences in the gene content and the repertoires of virulence factors.

RESULTS
general features and architecture of the c. ulcerans genomes
the genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> from a human clinical source and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> from an asymptomatic dog were determined by pyrosequencing using a quarter of a sequencing run with the genome sequencer flx instrument for each strain. the resulting reads were assembled with the newbler assembler software, and the remaining gaps were closed by pcr strategies that were supported by the related reference contig arrangement tool r2cat  <cit>  using the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> as a reference  <cit> . the final assemblies of the two genomic dna sequences yielded circular chromosomes with a mean g+c content of 53% , which is very similar to that of the closely related species c. pseudotuberculosis   <cit>  and c. diphtheriae   <cit> . the chromosome of c. ulcerans  <dig> has a size of  <dig> , <dig> bp and is thus  <dig>  bp smaller than that of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> . the subsequent gene prediction and annotation of the genome sequences was performed automatically with the gendb system  <cit> . after manual curation of the annotation,  <dig>  protein-coding regions were detected in the c. ulcerans  <dig> genome, whereas  <dig>  protein-coding regions were predicted in the genome sequence of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  these data already indicated strain-specific differences in the gene repertoires of both c. ulcerans isolates. relevant data and general features deduced from the genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> are summarized in table  <dig> 

a abbreviation: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats

the calculation of the g/c skew  of both genome sequences revealed a bi-directional replication mechanism for the c. ulcerans chromosome . according to the presence of conserved dnaa boxes , the origin of chromosomal replication  is located downstream of the dnaa gene and has a computed length of  <dig> bp  <cit> . the plot of the g/c skew additionally indicated the presence of a putative dif region involved in replication termination  <cit>  at the expected position of about 180° from oric, dividing the chromosome of c. ulcerans in two replichores of similar size . for a more precise detection of the dif region, the distribution of the actinobacterial architecture imparting sequences gggggga and gggggag  <cit>  was plotted on the leading and lagging strands of the c. ulcerans chromosomes . both linear plots show a characteristic distribution of the architecture imparting sequences, as these octamers are overrepresented on the leading strands and underrepresented on the lagging strands. putative dif regions were detected at around  <dig>  kb of the chromosomal map of c. ulcerans  <dig> and at  <dig>  kb of the c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> chromosome . in accordance with this computation, the respective dna regions of the c. ulcerans chromosomes contain a conserved 28-bp sequence that shows similarity to the consensus sequence of actinobacterial dif sites  <cit> . moreover, four rrn operons were identified in the genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  all rrn operons are located on the leading strands of the c. ulcerans chromosome; two are present on the right and two on the left replichore, respectively. in summary, the structural analysis of the complete genome sequences of two c. ulcerans strains revealed the typical architecture of a corynebacterial chromosome in this species  <cit>  with the presence of strain-specific variations that were investigated in more detail by the following comparative analysis.

comparative analysis of the gene order in the c. ulcerans genomes
a synteny analysis was performed by plotting reciprocal best blastp matches  <cit>  to compare the gene order in the chromosomes of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  this computation revealed a highly conserved order of orthologous genes between the two c. ulcerans chromosomes, as only three breakpoints of synteny were detectable in the left replichore . these breakpoints are clearly indicative of the insertion of additional dna regions into the chromosome of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  the annotation of the respective gene regions suggests that the breakpoints are due to the presence of prophage-like elements in the c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> genome, named Φculc22ii, Φculc22iii, and Φculc22iv . an additional prophage-like region  is present at identical positions in both c. ulcerans chromosomes . considering a total size of  <dig>  kb for the three additional prophage-like elements in c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> , the difference in size of the two c. ulcerans genomes is mainly caused by variations in the individual repertoire of prophages. this result indicates that the sequenced c. ulcerans strains are very closely related, although they were originally isolated at different locations from a human clinical specimen and the nares of an asymptomatic dog.

the gene order in c. ulcerans  <dig> was moreover compared to those in the taxonomically closely related species c. diphtheriae and c. pseudotuberculosis. this comparison revealed also a highly conserved order of orthologous genes in the genomes of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> and c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> , which is consistent with the previous observation that genetic rearrangements are rare in genomes of species belonging to the main lineage of the genus corynebacterium  <cit> . only one remarkable breakpoint of synteny was observed when comparing the order of genes in c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  this breakpoint is located at  <dig>  kb of the chromosomal map of c. ulcerans  <dig> and is caused by the integration of the prophage-like element Φculc809i .

the synteny analysis between c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> revealed two additional breakpoints within the highly conserved order of genes. the first breakpoint is located about  <dig> kb downstream of oric and comprises the genes of the corynephage β , among others coding for the diphtheria toxin in c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  the lysogenic β-corynephage is completely missing in the genome of c. ulcerans  <dig>  the second breakpoint of synteny is located at about  <dig> kb and comprises genes for nitrate reductase and associated protein-coding regions for the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor   <cit> . this observation is in line with taxonomic reports using nitrate reductase activity as a distinct metabolic marker to distinguish between c. diphtheriae  and c. ulcerans isolates, as nitrate reductase activity was not detectable in the latter species  <cit> .

comparative analysis of prophage-like sequences in the c. ulcerans genomes
according to the synteny analysis, the variation in the repertoire of prophage-like regions is a remarkable difference between the sequenced c. ulcerans genomes, as one putative prophage was identified in the c. ulcerans  <dig> genome and four prophage-like regions were detected in the genome sequence of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> . accordingly, this genome project provides the first molecular genetic data about corynephages infecting the species c. ulcerans that may also harbor β-corynephages coding for the diphtheria toxin  <cit> . the respective genomic regions of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> were characterized in more detail and the deduced genetic maps of the putative prophages are presented in figure  <dig> 

the prophage-like regions Φculc22i from c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> and Φculc809i from c. ulcerans  <dig> have a size of about  <dig> kb and are characterized by highly similar genetic maps. both prophage-like elements were detected at the same genomic position and apparently integrated at slightly different sites into a coding region for a hypothetical protein  that may represent the integration site of these phages in the c. ulcerans chromosome. minor differences between the putative prophages were detected in the number of predicted genes: the Φculc22i region comprises  <dig> genes , whereas  <dig> genes were assigned to the Φculc809i region . according to blastp matches and global amino acid sequence alignments, both putative prophages share  <dig> genes that code for gene products with a least 98% amino acid sequence identity. these values clearly demonstrate the very close relationship of both prophages from different c. ulcerans strains.

the prophage-like region Φculc22ii from c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> has a size of  <dig>  kb and comprises  <dig> genes . a sequence comparison with the corresponding region in the genome of c. ulcerans  <dig> revealed that this putative prophage is apparently integrated into the ortholog of culc809_ <dig> encoding a hypothetical protein. the integration of the putative phage into the chromosome of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> probably divided this gene into two pseudogenes  that are located directly adjacent to the Φculc22ii region. this view is supported by the presence of 8-bp direct repeats that are located at the borders of this prophage-like element and may represent the integration site of Φculc22ii in c. ulcerans .

the third prophage-like region of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  is located adjacent to a second trnalys gene that may represent the integration site due to the presence of a 21-bp direct repeat, which is part of this trnalys gene and flanks the prophage-like region . the Φculc22iii region has a size of about  <dig> kb and comprises  <dig> genes . the size difference between the prophage-like regions of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> suggests that at least Φculc22iii is incomplete and a defective remnant of a formerly active corynephage . the prophage-like region Φculc22iv of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> comprises  <dig> genes , has a size of about  <dig> kb and is located adjacent to a trnathr gene. a 26-bp direct repeat, which is part of the trna gene, may represent the integration site of the respective corynephage.

the previous experimental characterization of c. ulcerans  <dig> suggested the presence of a β-corynephage in this strain, as pcr assays amplified putative fragments of the tox gene coding for the diphtheria toxin  <cit> . however, neither the tox gene nor other dna segments of the β-corynephage were identified in the genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  this result is also obvious when considering the lack of synteny between the chromosomes of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> and c. ulcerans  <dig> at the integration site of the corynephage β . nevertheless, remnants of a putative corynephage are located adjacent to the trnaarg gene, which comprises the attachment site for the β-phage  <cit> . the genes culc809_ <dig> and culc22_ <dig> code for putative phage-type integrases in the genome sequence of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> and c. ulcerans  <dig>  the respective tyrosine recombinase from c. ulcerans shares 92% amino acid sequence identity with the integrase of the β-corynephage integrated in the genome of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> and is encoded adjacent to the trnaarg gene. this gene annotation supports the assumption that a lysogenic β-corynephage-like phage had been integrated in both c. ulcerans genomes in former times.

detection and comparative analysis of crispr regions in the c. ulcerans genomes
a screening of the genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> with the crisprfinder program  <cit>  revealed the presence of three loci of so-called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  . these repeat regions are often associated with crispr-associated  genes and may provide acquired immunity against bacteriophages and other foreign genetic elements by means of a sequence specificity that is determined by similarities between the spacer sequences and foreign dna  <cit> . crispr locus i is present in both sequenced c. ulcerans genomes and flanked by four cas genes . the direct repeats of this locus are  <dig> bp in length and separated by spacers with variable nucleotide sequences that are completely different in both c. ulcerans strains. the number of crispr spacers is also different in both strains, whereas the cas genes and the consensus sequences of the crisprs are identical .

similar structural features were observed for the second array of crisprs in the two c. ulcerans genomes . crispr locus ii is flanked by six cas genes . the consensus sequence of this crispr has a length of  <dig> bp, separated by either  <dig> spacers in c. ulcerans  <dig> or  <dig> spacers in c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  the spacers present in c. ulcerans  <dig> are different again to those located in the corresponding locus of the c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> genome. in contrast to crispr loci i and ii, a third putative crispr region in c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> is not specified by the presence of cas genes in the direct proximity. the crispr of this genomic region has a length of  <dig> bp, and the number of spacer sequences revealed the largest variation between both c. ulcerans strains, with  <dig> spacers present in c. ulcerans  <dig> and  <dig> spacers in the genome of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> . the detection of crisprs in the genome of c. ulcerans and the sequence variations of the crispr loci suggests the use of these molecular genetic markers for a more precise and high-resolution typing of closely related c. ulcerans strains from clinical specimens and animal reservoirs. a macroarray-based hybridization method, named spacer oligonucleotide typing , has already been developed to study the polymorphism of spacer sequences in crispr loci of distinct ribotypes from epidemic c. diphtheriae isolates  <cit> .

comparative analysis of the predicted gene content of the c. ulcerans genomes
the initial analyses of genomic features and the genome architecture of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> revealed considerable similarities between the sequenced genomes. the very close relationship of both strains is also evident when calculating the common gene repertoire by reciprocal best blastp matches with the edgar software  <cit> . both c. ulcerans strains share a common set of  <dig>  genes and are therefore characterized by small numbers of strain-specific genes, named singletons in this study  <cit> . as most strain-specific genes of the animal isolate c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> were assigned to the additional prophage-like regions Φculc22ii¸ Φculc22iii and Φculc22iv, only  <dig> coding regions of this strain were finally regarded as singletons sensu stricto, of which  <dig> genes were annotated with putative physiological functions . this group of singletons includes four genes coding for typical two-component signal transduction systems consisting of a sensor histidine kinase and a dna-binding response regulator. one two-component system is encoded by the genes culc22_ <dig> and culc22_  <dig> that are located downstream of culc22_ <dig> coding for a putative glycerol-3-phosphate transporter . the genes of the second two-component system  are located adjacent to a remnant of a transposase gene , suggesting a former event of horizontal gene transfer in this genomic region . other singletons of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> encode putative enzymes with unknown specificities, such as culc22_ <dig>  and culc22_ <dig> . two genes encoding surface-anchored proteins with lpxtg motif, including the spad gene for the major pilin subunit of an adhesive pilus structure, were also detected as singletons . the spad protein of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> differs in its amino acid sequence when compared with the functional counterpart culc809_ <dig> from c. ulcerans  <dig>  demonstrating that the adhesive pili of the two c. ulcerans strains vary significantly in the primary sequence of their major pilins that in principle constitute the shaft of the corynebacterial pilus structure  <cit> .

furthermore, the search for singletons by reciprocal best blastp matches with edgar revealed  <dig> strain-specific genes for the human isolate c. ulcerans  <dig>  of which  <dig> were annotated with putative functions . the genome annotation revealed two gene pairs coding for two-component systems as singletons, including culc809_ <dig> and culc_ <dig> that are flanked by transposase genes . the vsp <dig> gene  coding for a secreted serine protease and the rbp gene  encoding a putative ribosome-binding protein were also recognized as singletons in the genome of c. ulcerans  <dig>  both gene products represent candidate virulence factors of c. ulcerans  <dig> . interestingly, the rbp gene is located between a gene coding for a putative phage integrase  and a transposase gene  and is moreover specified by the low g+c content of  <dig> % , suggesting the horizontal transfer of this gene to c. ulcerans  <dig>  in summary, the detection and functional assignments of singletons indicates that the repertoire of potential virulence factors of the sequenced c. ulcerans strains is different in the two selected isolates from a human and animal source, respectively.

inter-species comparison of the gene content detected in the c. ulcerans genomes
the gene content of c. ulcerans  <dig> was compared in respect to encoded proteins with those of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> and c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  this comparative content analysis showed that  <dig> predicted proteins of c. ulcerans  <dig>  share homologs in the genomes of the closely related species . the number of core genes is remarkably low, as a similar calculation with genomic data from pathogenic and non-pathogenic corynebacteria, including c. diphtheriae, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium efficiens, and corynebacterium glutamicum, revealed  <dig> genes as a conserved corynebacterial backbone  <cit> . these numbers indicate a larger variation in the deduced gene repertoires from c. ulcerans, c. pseudotuberculosis and c. diphtheriae than initially expected when considering their close phylogenetic relationship. nevertheless, the conserved genetic backbone detected in both comparative studies comprises genes for the basic cellular machineries, such as the components involved in dna replication, dna repair, transcription, and protein biosynthesis, the conserved corynebacterial regulatory systems  <cit> , the components of the central carbon and energy metabolism, and of biosynthesis routes for amino acids, cofactors, purines, and pyrimidines, as well as the machinery involved in cell wall formation  <cit> .

interestingly, c. ulcerans and c. diphtheriae share only  <dig> genes, which are not present in the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis . according to the genome annotations, most genes of this group encode putative transporters and secreted proteins with unknown functions. on the other hand, c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis share  <dig> homologous genes , indicating that these species are more closely related to each other than to c. diphtheriae. the physiological functions encoded by this set of genes may also reflect differences in the lifestyle of the animal pathogens and the human pathogen c. diphtheriae. the group of homologous coding regions of c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis includes  <dig> genes with unknown function. however, the functional analysis of the remaining genes revealed that they mainly code for transport systems, including a variety of permeases and abc-type transporters for the uptake of metal ions, indicating an adaptation of both species to the availability of trace elements in their ecological niche. moreover, genes encoding the subunits of urease and accessory proteins of urease were only detected in the genomes of c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis, which is consistent with previous data describing these species as urease-positive, whereas c. diphtheriae was tested negative for urease activity  <cit> .

as expected, the pld gene encoding the sphingomyelin-degrading phospholipase d was found among the subset of genes homologous for c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . phospholipase d represents the major virulence factor of c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis and facilitates the persistence and spread of these bacteria within the mammalian hosts  <cit> . the cpp gene encoding the "corynebacterial protease cp40" was also detected in the genome of c. ulcerans. this secreted protein was described previously as a protective antigen of c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . as the comparison of the gene content among the three species of the c. diphtheriae cluster revealed notable differences in the repertoire of virulence factors, the genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> were searched for the presence of additional genes probably contributing to the virulence of these strains.

detection of genes encoding candidate virulence factors in c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad22
to extend the view on proteins probably contributing to the virulence of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig>  the annotated proteomes of both strains were screened for protein precursors with n-terminal secretion signals  <cit>  and proteins containing a c-terminal lpxtg motif allowing their anchoring to the bacterial cell wall  <cit> . this bioinformatic search revealed twelve candidate virulence factors that are common to both strains and two additional proteins encoded only in the genome of c. ulcerans  <dig> . in addition to the tspa and vsp <dig> gene products representing secreted proteins of the serine protease type in both strains, the vsp <dig> gene  encodes an additional extracellular serine protease in c. ulcerans  <dig>  this enzyme family can show a wide range of pathogenic potentials when interacting with tissue components of the host or with components of the host's defense system  <cit> . the redundancy of the corresponding enzymatic activities in c. ulcerans  <dig> might promote the interaction of the pathogen with the host and the survival of the bacterium in an unfavorable environment.

a predicted lpxtg motif used for anchoring of the protein to the cell wall

b data presented in this manuscript indicates a function as endoglycosidase. the gene should therefore be renamed as ndoe.

another potential virulence factor of c. ulcerans is the extracellular neuraminidase nanh . some enzymatic properties of this enzyme were characterized in a previous study indicating that this thermo-labile protein has a temperature optimum of 37°c and hydrolyses substrates such as horse serum glycoproteins  <cit> . the homologous enzyme from c. diphtheriae was characterized previously and shown to contain neuraminidase and trans-sialidase activities  <cit> . in principle, neuraminidases are a distinct class of glycosyl hydrolases that catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acids from various glycoconjugates and contribute to the recognition of sialic acids exposed on host cell surfaces, whereas trans-sialidases can be used for the decoration of various acceptor molecules on the cell surface to enable the invasion of host cells under certain conditions  <cit> . therefore, microbial neuraminidases and trans-sialidases have the general capacity to modify the ability of host cells to respond to bacterial infections and are thus of importance for any pathogenic microorganism.

furthermore, two gene clusters detected in each c. ulcerans genome are considered to encode adhesive pilus structures that are covalently anchored to the corynebacterial cell wall and probably mediate the initial adhesion of the pathogen to host tissues . different types of adhesive pili can presumably allow the pathogen to interact with different receptors on the host cell surface and to facilitate the delivery of virulence factors and intracellular invasion. the genetic organization of the first gene cluster is similar to the spadef gene region of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> encoding the spadef pilus  <cit> . this adhesive pilus of c. diphtheriae is composed of the major pilin spad, the minor pilin subunit spae and the tip protein spaf. the assembly of the spadef precursors into a high-molecular-weight pilus structure requires the pilus-specific sortases srtb and srtc that are encoded within the spadef gene region of c. diphtheriae  <cit> . likewise, the sortase genes srtb and srtc are present in the spadef regions of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> and probably involved  in the assembly of a distinct pilus structure on the cell surface of these strains.

the second pilus gene cluster detected in the genomes of the c. ulcerans strains consists of the spabc genes and the single sortase gene srta. the spab gene encodes a minor pilus protein, whereas the spac gene codes for a tip protein. the respective adhesive pilus of c. ulcerans thus lacks a major pilin subunit, unless it can be replaced by the major pilin spad of the spadef pilus. however, comprehensive studies in c. diphtheriae demonstrated that the adhesive pili of strain nctc  <dig> are independently assembled and are morphologically distinct  <cit> , suggesting that a replacement of the major pilin subunit is unlikely in c. ulcerans. interestingly, the adherence of c. diphtheriae to human pharyngeal epithelial cells can be mediated also by the minor pilin spab of the spaabc pilus  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that homodimeric or heterodimeric spab/spac proteins are anchored covalently to the cell surface of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> and provide tight contact between the bacterial cells and the host tissue in the absence of a pilus shaft  <cit> .

moreover, genes encoding homologs of the resuscitation-promoting factor interacting protein dip <dig>  and the cell wall-associated hydrolase dip <dig>  from c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> were detected in the genomes of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> . both conserved enzymes are involved in organizing the corynebacterial cell surface and contribute-probably indirectly-to the adhesion of c. diphtheriae to epithelial cells and the subsequent internalization of this pathogen  <cit> .

prominent virulence factors of c. ulcerans: phospholipase d, endoglycosidase endoe and the shiga toxin-like ribosome-binding protein rbp
a well-established virulence factor of c. ulcerans is the toxic phospholipase d  that shows amino acid sequence similarity to secreted phospholipases from c. pseudotuberculosis and arcanobacterium haemolyticum  <cit> . while sequence homologs of the pld enzyme are not found elsewhere in bacterial species, a similar enzyme is produced as an exotoxin in loxosceles spiders. the spider and bacterial enzyme were shown to hydrolyze albumin-bound lysophosphatidylcholine, yielding the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid, a known inducer of pro-inflammatory responses  <cit> . the pld gene was detected in both c. ulcerans genomes, which confirms previous pcr assays performed during the initial characterization of the two isolates  <cit> . moreover, the cpp gene  encoding "corynebacterial protease cp40" is present in the genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> . the homologous enzyme from c. pseudotuberculosis was identified as a protective antigen against caseous lymphadenitis  <cit>  and shown to be of the serine protease type as the purified protein revealed proteolytic activity in a gelatine sds-page assay  <cit> . on the other hand, database searches did not identify any active-site homologies with other serine proteases and protease activity was undetectable in culture supernatants of c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . as presented in figure 5a, the amino acid sequences of cpp from c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> revealed striking similarities to the α-domain of the extracellular endoglycosidase endoe from enterococcus faecalis  <cit> . the three proteins contain the conserved fgh <dig> motif assigning them to the glycosyl hydrolases of family  <dig> that includes enzymes with endo-β-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity  <cit> . endoe from e. faecalis is a two-domain protein that is characterized by two distinct activities involved in the degradation of n-linked glycans from ribonuclease b and the hydrolysis of the conserved glycans on igg  <cit> . the latter activity of the enzyme was assigned exclusively to the β-domain of the endoe protein, suggesting that the homologous counterparts from c. ulcerans have only a single activity as endoglycosidase. nevertheless, both c. ulcerans strains are probably able to interact with the mammalian host by glycolytic modulation of host glycoproteins.

as described above, the group of singletons detected in the genome sequence of c. ulcerans  <dig> comprises the rbp gene  that encodes a putative ribosome-binding protein containing the pfam domain  <dig> named "ribosome inactivating protein"  <cit> . the deduced amino acid sequence of rbp shows weak similarity to the a chains of the shiga-like toxins slt- <dig> and slt- <dig> from escherichia coli . the slt- <dig> protein of e. coli belongs to the ribosome-binding protein type ii family that is characterized by low similarity on the amino acid sequence level and, on the other hand, by a highly conserved tertiary structure of the family members  <cit> . the ribosome-binding protein identified in the c. ulcerans  <dig> genome shares only 24% identity with the a chain of slt- <dig>  but comprises all highly conserved amino acid residues needed for the catalytic n-glycosidase activity . moreover, an in silico comparison of the tertiary structures of rbp and the a chain of slt- <dig> demonstrates significant structural similarities of both proteins . slt- <dig> is usually composed of a catalytic a chain that is non-covalently associated with a pentamer of b chains  <cit> . the b subunits of slt- <dig> are essential for binding a specific glycolipid receptor and the subsequent translocation of the toxin into the endoplasmatic reticulum  of the host cell. the er-targeting sequence of slt- <dig> leads to retranslocation of the catalytic domain into the cytosol and the subsequent inhibition of protein biosynthesis by depurination of a single adenosine residue in the 28s rrna of the eukaryotic ribosome  <cit> . in vitro, slt- <dig> has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells isolated from various anatomical sites  <cit> . the analysis of the amino acid sequence of rbp revealed the lack of the er-targeting sequence at the c-terminal end of the protein from c. ulcerans  <dig>  however, as c. ulcerans can probably persist as a facultative intracellular pathogen in mammalian host cells, a retranslocation of the toxin into the cytosol is not necessary. the secretion of the putative toxin into the cytosol of the host cell is supported instead by a typical signal sequence at the n-terminus of the protein . as the enzymatic activity of the ribosome-binding protein rbp leads to inhibition of protein biosynthesis, as is the case with diphtheria toxin  <cit> , c. ulcerans  <dig> could have mimicked the systemic symptoms of diphtheria in the infected patient without carrying a lysogenic β-corynephage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the complete genome sequences from c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> provides detailed insights into the genome architecture and the repertoire of candidate genes contributing to the virulence of these strains. both c. ulcerans isolates differ in the number of prophage-like elements in the genome and lack sequences with similarity to the β-corynephage encoding the diphtheria toxin. therefore, the sequenced c. ulcerans isolates can be regarded in principle as "non-toxigenic" with respect to the synthesis of diphtheria toxin. this result of the genome sequence annotation is remarkable, as previous pcr studies and toxigenicity assays with c. ulcerans  <dig> suggested the presence of a diphtheria-like toxin in this strain that was isolated from a patient with pulmonary infection  <cit> . however, the comparison of tox genes showed differences in the amino acid sequences of the diphtheria toxin from c. diphtheriae and c. ulcerans isolates from extrapharyngeal infections  <cit> . this data indicated that the diphtheria toxin sequences from c. ulcerans isolates are less well conserved than their counterparts from c. diphtheriae  <cit> . moreover, the examination of diagnostic pcr assays for the detection of the tox gene in clinical samples revealed atypical results in some c. ulcerans strains  <cit> , indicating that a reliable diagnostic is necessary for the precise characterization of c. ulcerans strains from clinical specimens  <cit> . the absence of the diphtheria toxin gene in c. ulcerans  <dig> moreover explains why the medical treatment of the elderly patient with a diphtheria antitoxin was unsuccessful  <cit> .

the integration site of the β-corynephage is located at a trnaarg gene in the genomes of c. diphtheriae and c. ulcerans  <cit> . a remnant of a β-like phage was detected at this genomic position in the genome sequence of c. ulcerans  <dig>  and the rbp gene encoding a ribosome-binding protein is present in the immediate vicinity. the low g+c content of the rbp gene is suggestive of the horizontal transfer of this coding region to c. ulcerans  <dig>  whether the rbp gene was a former part of a corynephage or associated with an adjacent transposable element cannot be deduced from the current data and remains to be elucidated. the rbp protein of c. ulcerans  <dig> revealed structural similarity to the a chain of the shiga-like toxin slt- <dig> from e. coli  <cit> . the slt- <dig> protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute renal failure  <cit>  that was also diagnosed in the elderly brazilian woman with pulmonary infection  <cit> . therefore, the rbp protein of c. ulcerans  <dig> may represent a prominent virulence factor by inhibiting the protein biosynthesis in host cells due to the putative ribosome-binding activity.

interestingly, the rbp gene is absent in the genome sequence of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> that was isolated from an asymptomatic dog  <cit> . as the current knowledge of c. ulcerans is biased due to the predominant recovery of toxigenic strains from respiratory diphtheria-like illnesses in humans, future work should include strains from extrapharyngeal specimens and particularly from various animal sources. the sequencing of more c. ulcerans genomes from different habitats will open the way to the pan-genomic level of comparative genomics. a comparative approach with a larger set of sequenced c. ulcerans genomes may help to gain insights into the distinctive features of strains from human and animal sources and to describe the proposed zoonotic transmission of this pathogen in more detail.

it is moreover necessary to clarify the physiological role of the predicted "corynebacterial protease cp40". in a previous study, the homologous enzyme from c. pseudotuberculosis was assigned to the serine protease family due to its associated proteolytic activity although no protease activity could be detected in c. pseudotuberculosis culture supernatants  <cit> . in contrast to this data, the in silico analysis of the domain organization of cp <dig> in this study and previous phylogenetic data of glycosyl hydrolases strongly indicate that this protein is an endoglycosidase with similarity to the α domain of endoe from e. faecalis  <cit> . the α domain of endoe hydrolyzes the glycans on rnase b, which could be important for the pathogenesis and persistence of a bacterium during human infections  <cit> . we therefore suggest renaming the corresponding genes from c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis as "ndoe". in summary, the comparative analysis of two complete c. ulcerans genomes provides new valuable information on known virulence factors and detected novel candidate genes probably contributing to the virulence of this species. according to the genome annotation, the repertoire of prominent virulence factors from c. ulcerans  <dig> comprises the phospholipase d, the neuraminidase nanh, the novel ribosome-binding protein rbp, and the endoglycosidase endoe .
