BACKGROUND
hemoglobin  is a respiratory protein that facilitates the transport of oxygen  from the respiratory surfaces  to the inner organs  <cit> . hb is present in almost all vertebrates, except some icefish species  <cit> . it is member of the globin protein family that is characterized by a conserved fold that includes a heme prosthetic group, by which the proteins reversibly bind o <dig>  <cit> . in addition to hb, other types of globins are present in the jawed vertebrates : myoglobin   <cit> , neuroglobin   <cit> , cytoglobin  , globin e   <cit> , globin x   <cit> , globin y   <cit>  and androglobin   <cit> . a variety of functions other than o <dig> supply have been associated with these globins, including detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species  or signaling .

the hb of the jawed vertebrates is a hetero-tetramer that is composed of two α- and two β-chains. the interaction of the chains leads to cooperative o <dig> binding  <cit> . further modulation of the o <dig> affinity according to the physiological requirements is brought about by the interaction with organic phosphates , co <dig>  and protons , or by changing temperatures. multiple, paralogous α- and β-genes have originated in evolution by gene duplication and divergence. during ontogeny, the o <dig> demand changes and, consequently, in many vertebrates distinct hb chains are expressed in certain developmental stages  <cit> . for example, humans possess six hb genes   <cit> . their differential expression results in embryonic, fetal, and adult forms of hemoglobin tetramers  <cit> . the embryonic hb consists of two α or ζ chains, respectively, plus two ε chains; the fetal hb is composed of two α and two γ chains, which change to the adult hb form  during the first year after birth  <cit> . embryonic and fetal hb have higher oxygen affinities than adult hb, which is essential to overcome the placental barrier in mammals  <cit> .

the lamprey harbors five distinct globins: adgb, gbx and cygb, and functionally analogous hbs and mbs that evolved convergently from a common globin ancestor  <cit> . lampreys, along with hagfishes, constitute the cyclostomes, the sole survivors of a lineage that diverged from the ancestor to the jawed vertebrates more than  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . like its counterpart in the jawed vertebrates, the lamprey mb  is preferentially expressed in the skeletal muscle and presumably supports o <dig> to this tissue. the agnathan hb  is structurally distinct from the gnathostome hb, although it carries out similar functions. ahb is a monomer in its oxygenated form and associates into homodimers or tetramers when deoxygenated  <cit> . like the gnathostome hbs, ahbs display cooperative o <dig> binding and a ph-dependent regulation of o <dig> affinity  <cit> . in the sea lamprey petromyzon marinus, four distinct chains have been identified on the protein level that are components of the adult ahb . however, analysis of the p. marinus genome revealed at least  <dig> additional ahb genes plus two pseudogenes  <cit> . four of these closely resemble the known adult chains and probably are recent gene duplicates that cannot be distinguished from the main chain on the protein level. the expression patterns of the other nine ahbs remain unclear, leading to the speculation that they represent globin chains expressed in early developmental stages  <cit> .

sea lampreys  spend most of their life as filter-feeding larvae , burrowed in the sediments of freshwater rivers  <cit> . after a dramatic metamorphosis involving major modifications to the morphology, physiology and behavior of the animal  <cit> , the adult anadromous lampreys migrate to the sea, where they have a free-swimming hematophagous lifestyle. at the completion of the feeding phase, lampreys become sexually mature and return to fresh water, undergoing an upstream migration prior to spawning and death.

early electrophoretic studies reported a shift from larval to adult ahb proteins during metamorphosis in a number of lamprey species . more recently, lanfranchi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated differential expression of one larval and two adult ahb genes before and after metamorphosis in the po  brook lamprey . no further studies, however, have examined the expression of other globins during ontogenesis of lampreys, and little attention has been paid to other developmental stages . the presence of at least  <dig> ahbs genes in the genome of p. marinus suggests intricate developmental regulation of expression  <cit> . to trace the hemoglobin switch in lampreys, we employed an rna-seq and a qrt-pcr approach and studied the changes of the mrna levels of ahbs and the other globins during four developmental stages of p. marinus: embryo, larval, parasitic adult, and reproductive adult.

RESULTS
expression pattern of ahb during development
we quantified the mrna levels of the ahb genes of the sea lamprey  in different developmental stages by rna-seq and qrt-pcr. first, a selection of putative housekeeping genes was evaluated in rna-seq datasets for quality control and possible normalization. while the data indicate the integrity of the rna, none of the putative housekeeping genes showed constant expression levels. therefore, for rna-seq normalization was done relative to the maximum expression level of ahb <dig> in the adult reproductive datasets , which was set to  <dig> arbitrary units . all other expression levels were calculated as rpkm  and were related to that value. in qrt-pcr analyses, we estimated the mrna copy numbers.table  <dig> expression levels of globin genes in different developmental stages of the sea lamprey

the values were derived from the rna-seq data and related to the highest expression level of ahb <dig>  which was set to  <dig> arbitrary units 



both methods indicated differential expression of the globins throughout development. analysis by rna-seq showed that ahb <dig>  ahb <dig>  and ahb <dig> are almost exclusively expressed in the embryo . compared to the high levels of ahb in the adult stage, the overall expression levels in the total embryo were comparably low . ahb <dig>  ahb <dig>  ahb <dig>  and ahb <dig> are mainly expressed in the larval stage, with the highest levels for ahb <dig>  ; notable amounts of ahb <dig> were also detectable in the embryo . the other ngs datasets were separated into an adult-parasitic stage and an adult-reproductive stage. the genes representing the known chains of p. marinus ahb , ahb2a, b, c, ahb <dig>  ahb5a, b, d and ahb <dig> are most highly expressed in the adult-parasitic stage . notable amounts of ahb2b, ahb5d and ahb <dig> are also detectable in the later adult stage. ahb <dig> is the most highly expressed globin gene of p. marinus. while it is not expressed in the embryo and only traces could be found in the larva , it is a component of the adult ahb and reaches 100 au in the reproductive stage . this finding is supported by the qrt-pcr results employing adult blood . in the adult, notable amounts of mrna were also detected for ahb <dig>  while the other analyzed ahbs display low levels. the qrt-pcr further showed that ahb <dig>  ahb <dig> and ahb <dig> are mainly expressed in the ammocoete . the pattern of ahb <dig> differs from that of the other ahb genes, being expressed with increasing levels throughout ontogeny  .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of sea lamprey ahbs quantified by rna-seq. the ahb genes were displayed as predominantly expressed in the embryonic , larval , adult-parasitic  and adult-reproductive  stages. ahb <dig>  was not assigned to any specific developmental stage. the expression level is indicated as arbitrary units , relative to the highest rpkm of the pool of adult-reproductive ahb <dig> expression, which is set to  <dig>  note that the expression levels of ahb2a and ahb2c, and ahb5a and ahb5b, respectively, were almost identical

ontogeny of the tissue globins
in addition to the ahbs, which code for globin chains that transport o <dig> in the blood, the globin repertoire of the sea lamprey includes cygb, amb <dig>  amb <dig>  gbx <dig> and gbx <dig>  which reside in the tissues  <cit> . we traced the expression changes of these genes by rna-seq. among them, the mrna level of amb <dig> is the highest; while only  <dig>  au were found in the embryo, its expression constantly increases until it reaches 46 au in the adult stage . the level of amb <dig> and cygb are low throughout all developmental stages. the amb <dig> transcript is mainly expressed in the larva , and cygb is highest in the embryo  . the two gbx transcripts showed a low but differential expression: while gbx <dig> was found exclusively in the embryo , gbx <dig> is only expressed in the adult  .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of sea lamprey globins quantified by rna-seq. the expression level of amb <dig>  amb <dig>  cygb, gbx <dig> and gbx <dig> are indicated as au . the mrna levels of amb <dig>  cygb, gbx <dig>  gbx <dig> were additionally displayed in the inset



evolution of stage-specific hemoglobins in sea lamprey
we mapped the expression patterns onto a bayesian phylogenetic tree of the agnathan globins. for simplification, only globins of the sea lamprey were considered. the basic topology of the tree was similar to that retrieved in a previous analysis  <cit> . the ahbs build a single clade, which forms the sister group of the two ambs . in most cases, the ahbs that are predominantly expressed during a certain phase of the life cycle, cluster together in specific clades . only ahb <dig>  which is mainly expressed in both the embryo and the larva, and ahb <dig>  which is expressed throughout the lifecycle, do not match this pattern. among the sea lamprey ahbs, ahb <dig> diverged first, followed by ahb <dig>  next comes a clade composed of the embryonic ahbs , which forms the sister group of the larval ahbs  and adult ahbs .fig.  <dig> mapping of the stage specific expression patterns onto a bayesian phylogenetic tree of sea lamprey globins. the developmental stages are shaded in different grey scales. the numbers at the nodes are posterior probabilities. the bar represents  <dig>  pam distance



discussion
changes in hemoglobin composition during the ontogeny of the sea lamprey
protein studies identified four distinct ahb chains in adult sea lamprey , which correspond to ahb1- ahb <dig> and ahb <dig>  <cit> . in fact, the mrnas of these ahbs  are the most strongly expressed adult ahbs. ahb <dig> represents an additional adult chain, which has been missed in previous protein sequencing studies, probably due to its similarity with ahb <dig>  the composition of the ahb appears to change during the transition of the adult lamprey from the parasitic to the reproductive stage . while the mrna levels of ahb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> slightly decrease, ahb <dig> markedly rises to the highest levels measured for any globin in the sea lamprey. thus, the composition of the ahb changes during adult life. in contrast, electrophoretic studies on the hemoglobin of the austalian parasitic anadromous lamprey mordacia mordax found no difference between small adults just prior to parasitic feeding and large adults returning on their spawning migration  <cit> . thus, although it has long been known that a hemoglobin switch occurs in lampreys at metamorphosis, a further change in hb composition at maturation has not been previously characterized. it remains uncertain which physiological constraints alter the o <dig> demands in the reproductive form of the sea lamprey requiring such a change in ahb composition.

while protein sequencing supports the interpretation of ahb1- ahb <dig>  and ahb <dig>  as the main components of the adult ahb, the nature of the other ahbs can only be inferred by tracing their stage-specific expression. the embryonic ahb probably consists of at least ahb <dig>  ahb <dig>  and ahb <dig> encoded chains. traces of mrna of these ahbs can be also found in the adult reproductive  stage, which may be interpreted as eggs that were included in the mrna preparation. the larval ahb at least consists of chains encoded by ahb <dig>  ahb <dig>  and ahb <dig> transcripts. this interpretation is further backed by the ahba of the po brook lamprey  <cit> , which cluster in phylogenetic analyses with a clade formed by ahb <dig> and ahb <dig> of the sea lamprey  <cit> . the nature of ahb <dig> and ahb <dig> transcripts is less clear. ahb <dig> is most likely component of both the embryonic and the larval ahbs. the levels of ahb <dig> do not show indications of a clear switch but rather constantly increase during development, which hints at a more specific role.

convergent evolution of hemoglobin switching in jawed and jawless vertebrates
the data demonstrated three hemoglobin switches in the sea lamprey, which can be considered as functionally analogous to the hb switch of the jawed vertebrates  <cit> . the first switch occurs from the embryonic to the larval stage. an analogous hb switch during early development occur in fish  <cit>  and in amphibians  <cit> ; it can also be considered analogous to the switch from embryonic to fetal hb during mammalian development  <cit> . the second switch takes place during metamorphosis from the larval to the adult lamprey. again, analogous switches occur in the jawed vertebrates . a third, minor switch occurs during the transition of the parasitic to the reproductive adults .

however, the hb genes of jawed  and jawless  vertebrates are not homologous but emerged convergently  <cit> . thus, also the hemoglobin switch in these taxa must have emerged convergently and the scenario of an ancient common origin of the vertebrate hemoglobin switch can be excluded. the expression of different hb genes that probably result in changes of o <dig> affinities may be instrumental to adapt to different o <dig> requirements of different developmental stages.

ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny of lamprey hemoglobins
the phylogenetic tree  remarkably mirrors the ontogeny of ahb expression: embryonic ahbs diverged first, followed by larval and adult ahbs. only ahb <dig> and ahb <dig> deviate from this pattern. ahb <dig> is an embryonic/larval ahb that forms the earliest branching clade among the agnathan ahbs; in the tree, it is followed by ahb <dig>  which is expressed throughout the development of the sea lamprey, with increasing levels in later life. this tree topology may have emerged by chance; however, it is also conceivable that it reflects the different changes in lifestyles that have occurred during evolution. the embryonic ahbs may mirror the hemoglobin in the agnathan ancestor; the ahbs of the filter-feeding lamprey larva may reflect the ahbs that emerged with the first agnathans, which had a similar life style . this pattern suggests that the divergence of gbx <dig> and gbx <dig> has led to a subfunctionalization of these genes, which probably have specific roles in each developmental stage.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression of distinct genes during animal development allows for the emergence of specific structures and the adaptation to specific metabolic requirements. the developmentally controlled expression of hbs is probably the most prominent example of a switch in gene expression during the ontogeny of humans and other jawed vertebrates . here we have shown that in the sea lamprey, three hemoglobin switches occur, accounting for specific sets of ahb chains in the embryo, the larva, the parasitic adult and the reproductive adult. because hbs evolved convergently in gnathostomes and agnathans  <cit> , the hb switching in jawed and jawless vertebrates must also have evolved convergently. surprisingly, the ontogeny of sea lamprey ahbs recapitulates their phylogeny. this has not been observed for the gnathostome hbs.
