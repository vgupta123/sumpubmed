BACKGROUND
alternative splicing is an important regulatory mechanism for many species, allowing them to generate multiple variant proteins from the same primary transcript. in order to predict the complete protein complement of any eukaryote, we need to detect alternative splice sites and put them together in the correct combinations. algorithmic approaches to splice site prediction have relied mainly on the consensus patterns found at the boundaries between protein coding and non-coding regions  <cit> . however the sequence conservation found at the splice site junctions is not strong enough to accurately differentiate between introns and exons  <cit> . additional sequences, residing at variable distances from splice sites, have been shown to function as cis-acting factor binding sites that regulate splicing either in vivo or in vitro. although such splicing regulators have been identified in both exons and introns, exonic splicing regulators  are generally better characterized, and are probably more common  <cit> . such esrs either enhance or suppress the utilization of both 5' and 3' splice sites. much attention has been given to exonic splicing enhancers  which promote the inclusion  of the exons in which they reside. the first eses to be characterized were short, purine-rich motifs containing repeated gar  trinucleotides, but subsequently many other sequences have been shown to have enhancer activity  <cit> .

in animals, many exonic splicing enhancers are bound and activated by one or more of several related splicing factors known as sr proteins. the relationship between sequence-specific binding by sr proteins and the activation of splicing by exonic splicing enhancers is complex and incompletely understood. although only a dozen or so splicing events have been shown to be enhancer-dependent, the existence of exonic splicing enhancers within constitutively spliced exons  <cit> , the frequency of ese motifs  <cit>  and the absolute requirement for sr proteins by in-vitro splicing systems suggest that eses are ubiquitous, and required for all splicing events. it is estimated that as many as 15–20% of randomly appearing 20-mers contain a splicing enhancer  <cit>  and computational methods have predicted hundreds of ese motifs  <cit> . thus, it appears likely that many sequences may act to affect splicing. what is clear is that the motifs recognized by sr proteins are short  and degenerate  <cit> .

several computational approaches have been undertaken to find the motifs characteristic of these splicing regulatory elements. in a recent study, goren and colleagues  <cit>  introduced a computational method that identifies esrs based on conservation of wobble positions between orthologous human and mouse exons. their method identified  <dig> putative esrs, from which a sample of ten elements were shown experimentally to induce different levels of regulatory effects on alternative splicing. rescue-ese, another computational approach, identifies potential eses based on the theory that exons with weak splice sites are more likely to require ese activity for splicing  <cit> . the original study identified  <dig> exonic hexamers that were significantly enriched both in human exons relative to introns and in exons with weak splice sites relative to exons with strong splice sites; in vivo tests of these hexamers confirmed ese activity. in another study, zhang and chasin  <cit>  predicted human esr motifs by comparing the frequency of 8-mers in internal noncoding exons versus unspliced pseudo exons and 5' utrs of transcripts of intronless genes.

previous computational work on detecting eses has focused almost exclusively on mammalian species. there are compelling reasons to believe that eses play an important role in plants as well. early research on plant pre-mrna splicing emphasized the role of au-rich or u-rich sequences within introns  <cit> . these u-rich sequence elements play important roles in intron definition, and plants lack the very large introns that are associated with the need for exon definition  <cit> . on the other hand, a number of reports describe a role for exon sequences in the selection of plant splice sites  <cit> . sr proteins, the mediators of ese activity in vertebrates, are highly conserved in plants  <cit> . this pattern of conservation includes reactivity with the monoclonal antibody mab <dig>  <cit>  and extends to function. a mixture of arabidopsis sr proteins  <cit> , and atrszp <dig> in particular  <cit>  can complement sr-deficient mammalian splicing extracts. furthermore, plant sr proteins can influence splice site choice in mammalian nuclear extracts  <cit> , and can regulate alternative splicing in planta  <cit> .

the focus of this study is a new computational approach to identifying ese motifs in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, and their use in improving splice site prediction accuracy. first we apply a similar approach to rescue-ese to identify putative ese hexamers in the flanking ends of a large set of known internal exons from arabidopsis. then we use a gibbs sampling program called elph to identify statistically conserved motifs representing these hexamers in our data. in the end we show how these motifs can be used to improve splice site prediction. a significant improvement in specificity is obtained by incorporating the hexamer motifs into two leading splice site prediction programs, genesplicer  <cit>  and splicemachine  <cit> .

RESULTS
data sets
our ese analyses were done on several high-confidence arabidopsis data sets. the first set, eseara, was extracted from a set of very high-quality gene models obtained from  <dig> full-length transcripts sequenced released in  <dig>  <cit>   because internal homology in the data set could influence the results, we refined this reference set of gene models by using blast  <cit>  to perform pairwise alignments between all genes. sequences that aligned for more than 80% of their length with a blast e-value of less than 10- <dig> were removed. the resulting eseara set includes  <dig> genes containing of  <dig> coding exons with an average length of  <dig> base pairs . ese motifs were determined on this data set.

a second data set was used to evaluate the accuracy of splicemachine after introducing the ese motifs found in eseara. this data set consists of the  <dig> a. thaliana genes used previously in the evaluation of both genesplicer  <cit>  and splicemachine  <cit> . we will refer to this data set as gsara.

to test the accuracy of our splice site predictor outside the gene sequences, we collected one additional data set consisting only of intergenic regions situated between annotated a. thaliana genes. we used the highly curated, re-annotated arabidopsis chromosome ii sequence  and extracted regions located more than  <dig> nucleotides from any annotated genes. we called this data set intara.

ese motifs
we identified a total of  <dig> potential ese elements in the flanking regions of exons in the eseara data set . out of these  <dig> eses,  <dig> tend to be overly represented at the 5'end,  <dig> at the  <dig> 'end and  <dig> at both ends . the predicted ese candidates contained the two hexamers tgaaga and tgaagc, which are equally strongly represented by the motif found by elph in the 5'end data, but they did not contain the consensus of the motif predicted in the 3'end data . to find the motifs that were represented by these ese hexamers we ran elph using each of the  <dig> 5' eses and  <dig> 3'eses as input seeds on the 5' and 3' flanking ends respectively of the internal exons in eseara. running elph in this way generated position weight matrixes for all  <dig> input seeds but only  <dig> of the elph motifs found  were significantly conserved in the data .

ese activity has been shown for several of the hexamers identified  <cit> . out of the  <dig> hexamer motifs we identified as putative ese elements,  <dig>  are included in a set of experimentally confirmed 9-mers that function as exonic splicing enhancers in a. thaliana . most significantly, for  <dig> of these  <dig> 9-mers, mutation of one base  resulted in reduced ese activity for the mutant ninemer . it is also worth noting that the gaagaa hexamer, the highest scoring ese motif identified by our method, has long been known to function  as an exon splicing enhancer in humans  <cit> .

hexamer motifs that are contained within experimentally confirmed 9-mers with ese activity . experiments to confirm 9-mers are described elsewhere . column  <dig> shows the containing ese ninemer, and column  <dig> shows ninemers without ese activity, which are situated within 1– <dig> bp edit distance from the ese ninemer. the ese activity of each 9-mer in the table is shown by a score equal to log <dig>  <cit> .

splice site prediction
as mentioned above, several recent studies have described computational methods for identification of esr elements. however few attempts have been made to improve splice site prediction by using these elements; one exception is a method for exon prediction that uses eses and esss  <cit> . one of the goals of our study was to provide a way to integrate the motifs predicted as potential eses into splice site prediction programs, in particular genesplicer. we used the  <dig> putative ese motifs found by elph  and the corresponding splice site score predicted by genesplicer as features in a linear support vector machine . the lsvm created this way was integrated in the new splice site prediction system genesplicerese.

to evaluate the splice site prediction accuracy of genesplicerese, we applied a 5-fold cross-validation procedure on the eseara data set: the data were partitioned into  <dig> non-overlapping subsets, and each subset was held out separately while the system was trained on the remaining  <dig>  training included all positive examples, and  <dig>  randomly selected negative examples. as negative examples we considered all dinucleotides in the eseara data set that matched the consensus splice site , but did not overlap the confirmed splice sites. accuracy was then measured on all positive and negative examples from the held out data. all motif position weight matrixes were recomputed on  <dig> bp flanking exonic sequences from the training data, but the length for the flanking sequence involved in equation   was chosen between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. the optimal length of this flanking region was chosen for each splice site by applying a 5-fold cross-validation procedure on the training data. complete sensitivity vs. specificity plots for the original genesplicer and genesplicerese on this data are shown in figure  <dig>  a significant increase in accuracy of genesplicerese vs. genesplicer can be observed for both splice sites, with somewhat larger advantages occurring for acceptor sites. at the 95% sensitivity threshold , the false positive rate of genesplicerese is  <dig> % at the acceptor sites while genesplicer's false positive rate is 4% . for donor sites a 5% false negative rate  corresponds to  <dig> % and  <dig> % false positive rates for genesplicerese and genesplicer respectively .

rates on test data are obtained from a 5-fold cv procedure on the eseara data set, while fp rates on intergenic data are averages of the fp rates obtained on intara by setting a threshold that would produce the same fn rate on each of the  <dig> fold test data.

since the putative ese motifs were identified from hexamers that more frequently appear near weak splice sites than strong splice sites, it is likely that the improvement in accuracy obtained by genesplicerese is due primarily to an improvement in weak splice site recognition. our results show that, with the addition of eses, we recover ~20% of all the weak splice sites of either type  that were missed previously . figure  <dig> shows that the main contributor to genesplicerese's improved prediction accuracy is its better performance on weak splice sites. almost all of the false positives that are eliminated by use of genesplicerese rather than genesplicer are associated with weak splice sites and this is true across a range of false negative rates.

our experience with genesplicer revealed larger false positive rates on intergenic data than on sequences containing coding genes. by using our predicted ese elements we hoped that these false positive rates could be decreased in genesplicerese. indeed genesplicerese's false positive rates are significantly reduced on the intara data set, even more than on the eseara data set, probably due to the fact that the predicted ese elements are more likely encountered into coding regions. at a threshold corresponding to a 5% false negative rate on the eseara data set, the acceptor sites' false positive rate for intara is almost twice as big in genesplicer vs. genesplicerese , and significantly bigger at the donor sites .

our efforts to improve splice site prediction by introducing putative ese scores have been focused on improving our previously developed splice site predictor, genesplicer. the method we used here can equally well be adapted to improve other splice site prediction programs. as an example, splicemachineese is a splice site predictor that we created by adding the ese motif scores to the set of features used by splicemachine  <cit> . we downloaded splicemachine from the authors' website  <cit>  and trained it using the same procedure as the one described by the original authors: a sub-sample of  <dig> actual and  <dig> pseudo-sites was used to obtain the optimal context sizes for all features, and then a linear svm was trained on the complete training data set. our training of splicemachine on the gsara data set revealed false positive rates comparable to the ones previously published . table  <dig> shows the previously reported false positive rates on the gsara data set  <cit>  compared to the ones we obtained for splicemachineese. even though splicemachine captures both positional and compositional information at all positions in large windows  around splice sites, we were still able to decrease its false positive rates . at 95% sensitivity the false positive rate dropped from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for donor sites and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for acceptor sites.

the false positive rates for splicemachine are copied from  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified  <dig> potential ese hexamers in the flanking regions of internal coding exons from a large set of high confidence arabidosis thaliana genes. these  <dig> eses were used to generate motifs with a gibbs sampling program called elph. we believe these motifs to be important in splice site regulation.  <dig> of them have subsequently been validated experimentally to show ese activity. we have incorporated these motifs into two splice site prediction methods and shown that they lead to an increase in accuracy for both programs.
