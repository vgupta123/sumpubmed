BACKGROUND
proteins perform a variety of biological functions, the efficiency and specificity of which are determined to a large extent by their intrinsic sequence-structure properties. many biophysical and biochemical activities such as binding specific substrates, catalysis, or allosteric responses involve particular sequence motifs at functional sites. identification of functional sites, or understanding sequence-to-function mapping, in general, has been a major goal in computational molecular biology and bioinformatics. with rapid accumulation of genome scale sequence data there is an ever increasing need for efficient assessment of potential functional sites.

among different criteria adopted to identify functional sites, sequence conservation has probably been the most widely used, based on the fact that functional residues are often conserved across all or the majority of members in a given family of proteins. algorithms developed for detecting conservation patterns are traditionally based on multiple sequence alignments  <cit> . other algorithms use a combination of sequence and structure comparisons provided that structural information is available, which usually yield relatively higher predictive abilities  <cit> . a set of criteria was proposed by thornton and coworkers for detecting catalytic residues, which was successfully implemented in an algorithm for identifying active sites  <cit> . other strategies include pattern matching such as tess  <cit> , fff  <cit>  and spasm  <cit>  that locate functional sites by detecting small three-dimensional motifs. proteins dynamics has been shown to be another property that can be advantageously examined to detect functional sites  <cit> . we have recently shown that the global hinge centers of enzymes co-localize with their catalytic sites, pointing to the importance of coupling between mechanics and chemistry for enzymatic activity  <cit> . in addition, analyzing patterns of communication and shortest paths in protein structures modeled as networks has proven useful in identifying allosteric sites  <cit> .

in the present study, we propose another property that can serve as a criterion for detecting functionally important sites: scarcity or rareness in the space of sequence motifs. motifs composed of three sequential amino acids  are considered here as the shortest, yet distinctive, sequence fragments that can provide statistically significant information. the choice of 3-grams in the following work is based on preliminary studies as well as our previous work  <cit>  that showed that 1-grams and 2-grams do not confer enough specificity while there is no major difference in the performance of 3-grams and 4-grams , while 3-grams lend themselves to more accurate statistics. a given 3-gram will be termed 'rare' if its probabilistic occurrence in the uniprot   <cit>  is significantly lower than that expected from an unbiased distribution, as will be explained in quantitative details below.

a notable feature emerging from this study is the propensity of proteins' active sites to populate rare sequence motif, akin to the notion that rare structural motifs co-localize with functionally important sites  <cit> . this selectivity suggests that enzymes tend to recruit such distinctive/rare sequences at their active sites to increase their specificity, consistent with the higher information content associated with rare events. we illustrate the functional importance of such rare 3-grams in three proteins, c-src kinase, hemoglobin, and tyrosyl-trna synthetase.

RESULTS
distributions of 3-grams
a given protein sequence of n residues is viewed as a collection of n – n +  <dig> overlapping words of n letters, termed n-grams , composed of n contiguous amino acids along the sequence. for each protein, we consider all 3-grams  or triplets, by sliding a window of three amino acids along the sequence, thus leading to a total of  triplets. the natural frequency of a given 3-gram of type i  is defined as

the unbiased probability of a given 3-gram is p <dig> = 1/ <dig> =  <dig> , and the corresponding count is c <dig> = ctot/ <dig> =  <dig> in the uniprot. the 3-grams whose count is lower than this value by a factor of f =  <dig> compose 10% of all the counts ctot in uniprot, and those lower by f =  <dig> amount to 4% of ctot.

the present approach permits us to assign a scarcity score to each amino acid in a given sequence without recourse to sequence alignment. in the calculations below we have performed similar analyses for protein families, where the occurrence of rare 3-grams at specific locations where examined with regard to their conservation properties. given an alignment of homologues sequences, an average scarcity score was assigned to each position j along a sequence k, based on the minimum value, puni|jk=min{p    auni,p    bunip    cuni}jk

proteins tend recruit rare 3-grams at their active sites
the biological significance of rare 3-grams has been examined by analyzing the results with regard to the dataset of  <dig> non-redundant enzyme/ligand complexes compiled by gutteridge and thornton  <cit> , shortly referred to as the gt dataset . two non-overlapping subsets of 3-grams were retrieved from the gt dataset. the first is composed of all 3-grams located at the active sites, and the second includes all other residues. the two subsets comprise  <dig>  and  <dig>  3-grams, respectively. active site 3-grams are defined as those containing at least one heavy atom located within 5Å from the ligand.

* the table lists the pdb code and chains used. care was taken not to double count 3-grams in cases where the active site is located at the interface of two identical subunits.

the uniprot frequencies of these two groups of 3-grams yielded the histograms displayed in figure 4a. to obtain these histograms, the ensemble of 3-grams in the respective subsets  <dig> and  <dig> of active site residues  and other residues  have been organized into groups of different uniprot frequencies, and the counts of 3-grams in each group have been determined. the abscissa shows the ranges of uniprot counts, divided into intervals of Δ ci =  <dig>  starting from ci≤  <dig>  , and the ordinate represents the population  of each group. not all  <dig> types of 3-grams were represented in this set of  <dig> enzymes.

comparison of the two histograms immediately reveals the tendency of the active site 3-grams to populate the lower uniprot counts. for example, let us consider the rare 3-grams .  <dig> % of active site 3-grams fall in this range, whereas the percentage drops to  <dig> % when 3-grams at other regions are considered. therefore, rare 3-grams are over-represented in the active sites by a factor of  <dig> . the difference between the two distributions shown in panel a is statistically significant .

similarly, we compared the histogram obtained for the subset of active site 3-grams with that calculated for solvent-exposed 3-grams . figure 4b shows the histograms for active site  and exposed  residues. the active sites are again distinguished by the propensity of rare 3-grams. rare 3-grams are  <dig>  times more frequent at active sites compared to exposed regions  . the difference between the two histograms is more pronounced than that observed in panel a.

next, we examined the identity of 3-grams at the active sites, and focused in particular on the rare 3-grams that are recruited. given that not all of the  <dig> types of 3-grams were represented in the gt dataset, not all types of 3-grams might be either seen at the active sites. we first analyzed the amino acid composition of active sites. for each amino acid, the probabilities of being located at the active site versus elsewhere were calculated. the ratio between these two probabilities, termed the active site propensity, is shown in figure 5a. four amino acids, cys, his, gly, and trp, are distinguished by their high active site propensities. this is in agreement with previous work  <cit>  where his and cys were shown to have the highest propensity for serving as catalytic residues via their side chains, while gly has the highest propensity of catalyzing reactions via its main chain. we also note that, in the present study, arg and glu exhibit relatively low tendencies to locate at active sites, while these two amino acids were reported by bartlett et al  <cit>  to have relatively high catalytic propensities. this difference presumably arises from the different definitions adopted for active sites in the two studies: we refer to all amino acids located in the neighborhood of the ligand, while bartlett et al  <cit>  referred to residues directly involved in catalytic activity.

cys and his, two residues that have the highest active site propensity  are among the least frequent amino acids in terms of their natural occurrence. figure 5a shows the relation between the frequencies of amino acids in uniprot and their active site propensities. while the data are scattered, there is a discernible anti-correlation between the two sets of data, consistent with figure 4; rare amino acids have a higher tendency to be in active sites. clearly this preference becomes more pronounced when 3-grams, as opposed to monograms are examined, as a can be seen from the skewed distribution of the frequency of active site residues towards lower counts in figure  <dig> 

rare 3-grams may arise from three possibilities:  these may be words in which the individual letters have low natural frequencies themselves ,  these may be rare 'words', i.e. rare combinations of particular amino acids ; or  these may be rare despite their enhancement  due to the extremely low natural frequencies of the individual amino acids that compose them. counterparts of figure  <dig> plotted for the active site 3-grams and other 3-grams showed that both groups fall in the first category . their observed counts plotted against the expected ones yield a slope of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the rare 3-grams belonging to the two groups, on the other hand, exhibited a slight enhancement of ai =  <dig>  and  <dig> , for active site and other residues, respectively. thus, 3-grams recruited at active sites are usually combinations of residues which already have relatively low natural frequencies of occurrence. yet, particular 3-grams exhibit significant departure from their expected occurrence probabilities, e.g. sss, ggg, rrr, gsg , and lel . see table s <dig> and s <dig> in additional files for details. among rare 3-grams at active sites, also exhibiting a large enhancement in the uniprot , we distinguish wwh and hcw.

scarce 3-grams in the gt dataset
scarcity scores were calculated for all 3-grams in each of the  <dig> proteins in the gt dataset. the postulate that rare 3-grams  preferentially locate in active sites was examined for a series of threshold scores. for each enzyme, the rates of true positives  and false positives  were evaluated as a function of threshold scarcity scores, tp rates being defined as the fraction of active site 3-grams that exhibit scarcity score above the threshold value. table  <dig> shows the average ratios between the rates of tps and fps for seven different thresholds. the uppermost threshold  shows more than threefold enhancement in the rate of tps relative to fps, while the discriminative power of the scarcity score vanishes as we lower the threshold. a detailed list of tp and fp rates along with the top ranking 3-grams are provided for each enzyme in the additional files table s <dig>

src kinase
the src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases is a member of the tyrosine kinases superfamily and plays an important role in cell differentiation, proliferation and survival  <cit> . c-src, a member of src protein kinase family, contains two peptide binding modules , a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain  and a c-terminal regulatory tail  . its phosphorylation at activation loop residue y <dig> results in intramolecular interaction between the sh <dig> domain and the phosphorylated c-terminal tail, triggering a transition into an inactive conformation with the sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains moving away from the catalytic site clamping the latter in a strained conformation. dephosphorylation of y <dig> and phosphorylation of y <dig>  on the other hand, activate the kinase via movement of the activation loop and opening of the catalytic cleft between the n- and the c- lobes of the kinase domain.

d117wwl <dig> is located in the sh <dig> domain, and interacts with the linker that connects the sh <dig> and kinase domains when the kinase adopts its inactive conformation . the sh3-linker interactions have been pointed out to serve as an independent mode of regulation for hck, a src family member  <cit> . in addition, trp <dig>  at the ligand-binding site of sh <dig>  <cit> , was found to be essential to the stability of the sh3-vsl <dig> complex  <cit> .

the third stretch, y382vh <dig>  forms the src catalytic loop. y <dig> takes part in key interactions that stabilize the kinase domain in the inactive conformation  <cit>  and h <dig> belongs to the conserved hrd motif of the catalytic loop. lys <dig> at sh <dig> domain interface interacts with the c-terminal regulatory tail.

the other three stretches of amino acids i426kwta <dig>  d444vwsf <dig>  and c496qcwrk <dig> form a cluster located at and beneath the substrate binding region . the portion q497cwr <dig> is composed of two overlapping 3-grams that have the highest scarcity scores in the protein. notably, the central residues in these stretches, w <dig>  c <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  are highly or fully  conserved, lending support to their critical role.

a systematic analysis of amino acid conservation conducted for c-src protein family members demonstrated that amino acids distinguished by their high scarcity scores tend to be conserved among the family members , despite their being rare in the uniprot. conserved sites distinguished by their scarcity include, in addition to the four residues listed above, w <dig>  k <dig>  t <dig>  f <dig>  s <dig>  a <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig> and v <dig>  see additional files table s <dig> for details.

hemoglobin
hemoglobin  is a tetramer composed of two α- and two β-subunits  organized in two dimers, α1β <dig> and α2β <dig>  symmetrically positioned around a central water-filled cavity . each subunit has a heme that binds oxygen. the oxygenation of hb is cooperative, i.e. binding of a first o <dig> enhances the o <dig> affinity of the other subunits. following the mwc model  <cit> , hb exists in two conformations in rapid equilibrium: the t state with low affinity for oxygen binding and the r state with high affinity. the intrinsic oxygen binding affinity of the tetramer is nearly 300-fold lower than that of its free α1β <dig> dimer  <cit> , implying that the interactions at the dimer-dimer interface interfere with substrate binding unless relieved by a conformational switch.

notably, all of these stretches of amino acids distinguished by their high scarcity score assume functional roles in hb. α r31mf <dig> and α y42fphfd <dig> are directly involved in binding the heme group. the mutant r31s results in abnormal hemoglobin – hb prato  <cit> . α tyr <dig> forms an inter-subunit hydrogen bond with β asp <dig> across the dimer-dimer interface in the t state of hemoglobin but not on the r state. kavanaugh et al  <cit>  showed that this hydrogen bond and other interactions associated with the side chain of α tyr <dig> make a major contribution to the stability of the t state. α h87ah <dig> corresponds to the heme binding site, with α his <dig> coordinating the fe atom. the fe-nε bonds between the heme group and α his <dig> or β his <dig> are essential for the cooperativity of hemoglobin  <cit> . α his <dig> is located inside a central cavity lined with excess of positively charged ionizable groups. it has been suggested  <cit>  and experimentally validated  <cit>  that the mutual repulsion of these ionizable groups increases the oxygen affinity by raising the free energy of the t state. using network analysis, del sol et al. confirmed that α his <dig> plays an important role in allosteric communication  <cit> . we also note the critical position of α his <dig> at the α1β <dig> interface with α ser <dig> pointing toward the heme binding pocket. among the residues participating in rare sequences in subunit β, in addition to the heme-binding β h <dig>  we note β k <dig>  the substitution of which by asn has been reported to lead to abnormal hb j amiens  <cit> . the segment β y35pwtq <dig> is located at the convergence of the α1β <dig> and α2β <dig> interfaces and is important for allostery. mutations of β 37w  have been shown to lead to tetrameric hb with functional properties similar to those of the αβ dimers; that is, high oxygen affinity with no cooperativity  <cit> . finally, the 4-gram β h143kyh <dig> at the c-terminal end of subunit β and in particular h <dig> is a binding site for allosteric effectors  <cit> .

in addition to the above experimental evidence, we note that using the gaussian network model we have shown that two segments, α f36-h <dig> and β t87-β n <dig>  play a key role in the allosteric transition of hb from constrained  to flexible   state  <cit> ; these two regions include the so-called switch region  <cit> . the first stretch partially overlaps with α y42fphf <dig> and the second contains β l91hcd <dig>  these results lend further support to the critical role of the rare n-grams, and in particular β his <dig>  in propagating allosteric signals. finally, we note that out of  <dig> rare residues identified in hb,  <dig> are fully conserved , and  <dig> highly conserved .

upon scanning the hemoglobin sequence against the prosite database  four histidines are retrieved, two  on α-subunits, and two  on β-subunits. as mentioned above, α his <dig> and β his <dig>  also detected among the rare 3-grams, coordinate the fe atom of the heme group, while α his <dig> and β his <dig> are located at the same region across the heme plane.

results in the absence of sequence alignment
in the above three examples the scarcity score was calculated by averaging puni|jk over a set of homologous proteins. however, in principle, scarcity score calculations can be equally performed for a single sequence as the ingredient is the uniprot frequencies for triplets along the sequence. the alignments are simply used to magnify  the signals that could, otherwise, be extracted from single sequence analysis. as shown in the figures s1–s <dig> in the additional files, the sjuni

CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that relatively rare sequence motifs are preferentially recruited at enzymes' active sites. the probabilistic occurrence of rare 3-grams at active sites is higher than that of other 3-grams by a factor of more than  <dig>  and higher that of exposed 3-grams by a factor of  <dig>  according to the results obtained for the gt dataset of  <dig> enzymes . detailed analysis of each enzyme in this dataset demonstrated that a scarcity score threshold of  <dig> , permits us to identify 3-grams located at/near active sites, with a tp rate more than three times larger than the fp rate. these results were obtained from the sequence of the individual enzymes without recourse to sequence alignment or any amino acid conservation information.

the preferential selection of rare 3-grams at functional sites may not be a property of enzymes, exclusively, but that of proteins, in general, as the current application to hemoglobin suggests. we have illustrated and discussed here the functional importance of rare 3-gram motifs for three proteins: c-src, hemoglobin and tyrosyl-trna synthetase.

as a further assessment of the functional importance of rare n-grams, we examined the conservation of these n-grams among the members of the three families of proteins on which we focused. figure  <dig> displays the results, reported in terms of the shannon entropies  <cit> , for two groups of residues:  the rare residues distinguished by their high scarcity scores , and  all other residues. the respective numbers of residues in the two sets are  <dig> and  <dig>  the histograms  are displayed for bins of size  <dig> . we note that unique residues exhibit a stronger tendency to be conserved  among the members of the examined families, lending further support to their functional importance .

while our analysis is purely sequence-based, it appears to be conceptually in accord with two structure-based studies that indicate that rare structural motifs correlate with proteins functional sites. petock et al  <cit>  showed that 9-residue fragments of rare backbone conformations often form parts of ligand-binding sites, protein-protein interactions, and domain-domain contacts. likewise, novotny and kleywegt  <cit>  found that, even thought left-handed helices are rare, when they do occur, they are structurally or functionally significant. the present analysis shows that not only structural motifs, but sequence motifs as well, tend to be highly distinctive at active sites. this selection of rare sequence motifs seems to be driven by specificity requirements. notably, the rarest amino acids  have unique functional properties: cys and met are sulfur-containing amino acids and are sensitive to oxidation. likewise, his is unique as its protonation depends on ph, and trp is distinguished by its bulky size and significant contribution to stabilization of hydrophobic cores or interfaces. it has been suggested that proteins may even sustain a decrease in their stability in order to form effective functional sites  <cit> . in accord with the above notion, these highly specific residues, trp, his, met, and cys, may be used by enzymes for precise functional purposes, their specificity being amplified in 3-grams where two or more of these amino acids are juxtaposed.

identification of proteins' functional sites using computational tools is a major challenge in computational biology in the post-genomic era  <cit> . sequence and structure conservation are the major criteria used by current algorithms to identify functional important sites. identification of functional sites for orphan proteins  is beyond the scope of algorithms that use conservation as major criterion for identifying these sites. notably, we repeated the scarcity score analysis by using only a single chain and we were still able to identify functionally important sites , demonstrating that the potentially functional sites of orphan proteins can also be assessed by our methodology, and that conservation and scarcity are two different features. we note that the average scarcity score of scarce and conserved residues will be higher than that of scarce and non-conserved residues, as the scarcity score is evaluated as an average over all aligned sequences. however, calculations repeated for single query sequences, as opposed to those averaged over multiple aligned sequences showed that such effects are negligibly small and the profile of scarcity scores for examined proteins are robust. in addition, we have compared the scarcity scores  and the shannon entropies at the corresponding amino acid positions. computations for the three test cases revealed that residues participating in rare 3-grams  are not necessarily conserved or vice versa. however, they do exhibit a higher tendency to be conserved compared to other amino acids, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  therefore, it is conceivable that a combined approach exploiting both conservation and scarcity may enhance the score/signal associated with particular sites, thus increasing the ability to accurately identify functional motifs.
