BACKGROUND
there is clinical evidence of cognitive dysfunction in certain schizophrenic patients that is likely to be independent of psychotic symptoms  <cit> . this dysfunction does not seem to involve a single brain region but rather a network that includes cortical and sub-cortical regions such as the hippocampus. the therapeutic benefits of various antipsychotic drugs are thought to be predominantly associated with their antagonistic actions on d2-like  dopamine receptors in the brain  <cit> . although early studies with typical antipsychotic drugs  mostly failed to report significant improvements of cognitive behaviors in schizophrenic patients  <cit> , more recent data especially obtained using atypical antipsychotics  demonstrated positive effects  <cit> . for example, risperidone has been associated with improved verbal working memory and executive functions whereas clozapine and quetiapine seem to improve verbal fluency  <cit> .

the beneficial effects of antipsychotics on cognitive functions and neuroprotection are supported by in vitro and animal studies reporting on the protective effects of these drugs in various models of toxicity including focal ischemia  <cit> , serum deprivation  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit> . more recently, it has been reported that the antipsychotic olanzapine was neuroprotective against various forms of toxicity through the phosphorylation of kinases such as akt  <cit> .

in the present study, the possible neuroprotective properties of low concentrations of various antipsychotic drugs and other dopamine receptor antagonists were studied in a model of toxicity using primary cultured neurons of the hippocampus, an area particularly relevant to cognitive processes.

RESULTS
dopamine receptor transcripts are expressed in mature cultured hippocampal neurons
we estimated first the number of mature neurons in our 3-day old hippocampal cultures using immunocytochemistry for the neuron-specific marker neun  <cit> . approximately 75% of the cells were labeled thereby indicating that a high proportion of neurons were mature at this stage.

we determined next if the genes coding for the dopamine receptor subtypes were expressed in these cultures. the primer pairs for the amplification of dopamine receptor subtypes  <dig> to  <dig> cdnas were first tested on rna extracted from rat striatum using a reverse transcription-multiplex pcr . as shown in fig 1b, all primer pairs were able to generate products of the expected length. rt-mpcr was next performed on samples from untreated  <dig> day-old primary hippocampal cultures. transcripts for all five dopamine receptor subtypes were also found to be expressed in these cultures . it is of note that band intensities do not necessarily reflect relative expression levels of transcripts for the various dopamine receptor subtypes in the starting extract since no internal standards were used. no products were seen when reverse transcriptase was omitted in the rt step indicating that amplified fragments are from transcribed mrna. splice isoforms for the d <dig> and d <dig> receptor subtypes were observed as well, in both striatum and hippocampal cultures. sequencing of hippocampal main pcr products confirmed that amplifications were specific for dopamine receptors and that the d <dig> primer pair amplified the two alternatively spliced transcripts coding for functionally distinct isoforms d2l and d2s  <cit> .

effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics against toxicity induced by n <dig> constituents-deprivation
as previously described in rat neuroblastoma cells  <cit> , deprivation of transferrin, one of the major iron transport protein in the blood  <cit> , selenium, an essential nutrient with antioxidant properties  <cit> , as well as putrescine, a drug with growth-stimulatory properties  <cit> , resulted in about  <dig> % of hippocampal neuronal cell death as monitored  <dig> days later using mtt and nr colorimetric assays. cell death was strongly reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, in presence of atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine which preferentially binds to d <dig> receptors over d <dig> or d <dig> receptors  and risperidone, a d2/d <dig> receptor antagonist that protected hippocampal neurons at the highest concentration tested here . the effects of these atypical antipsychotics were shared by the classical antipsychotic haloperidol which offered a maximal protection at 10- <dig> m  while, as expected, a higher concentration  was toxic on its own to hippocampal neurons . similar effects were obtained with -sulpiride, a selective d <dig> dopamine receptor antagonist belonging to the benzamide class ; domperidone, a d2/d <dig> receptor antagonist ; chlorpromazine, a typical antipsychotic which binds with nm affinities to d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> receptors ; and -butaclamol, a d2/d <dig> dopamine receptor antagonist . interestingly, a d <dig> receptor antagonist, l- <dig>    <cit>  somewhat protected neurons . cells treated with the n <dig> supplement showed the same magnitude of protection  as that of cells treated with most of drugs at 10- <dig> m, suggesting that depletion in growth medium rather than cell washes are responsible for decreases in mtt and nr values.

in contrast, the piperidine metabolite of haloperidol, which is devoid of affinity for d2-like receptor  <cit>  was ineffective . similarly, -raclopride, a d2/d <dig> receptor antagonist, and the d <dig> receptor antagonist -sch- <dig> failed to protect hippocampal neurons . the d <dig> dopamine receptor antagonist u  <dig> maleate  <cit>  was also ineffective  . finally, remoxipride, another d <dig> receptor antagonist with weak d <dig> receptor affinity, failed to protect neuronal cells .

d <dig> but neither sigma nor nmda receptor antagonists blocked the protective effect of antipsychotics
besides its well-known antidopaminergic activity, it has been hypothesized that haloperidol protects neuronal cells <cit>  through its purported activity at σ <dig>  <cit>  or nmda receptors  <cit> . however, neither ne- <dig> , a potent and selective σ <dig> receptor subtype antagonist, nor -mk- <dig> , a non-competitive nmda antagonist, affected neuronal survival . moreover, these compounds failed to modulate the protective effect of haloperidol . interestingly, the protective effect of clozapine  was blocked by a 5-min pre-treatment with the -raclopride, the sole d2-like receptor antagonist that failed to protect cells in our model .

the protective effects of antipsychotic drugs may involve caspases but not the inhibition of the production if free radicals
in light of the purported anti-apoptotic effects of atypical antipsychotics drugs  <cit> , we investigated next the effects of various inhibitors of caspases, these enzymes likely playing a pivotal role in apoptosis-related cell death. in our model, the co-administration of the caspase- <dig> inhibitor devdo-cho , the caspase- <dig> inhibitor ietd-cho  or to a lesser extent the caspase- <dig> inhibitor lehd-cho  significantly reduced cell death, devdo-cho being the most potent . the protective effects of inhibitors of caspases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were not accompanied by changes in ros accumulation, as evaluated by the dcf assay . it has recently been shown that the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine increased cell viability after an exposure to h2o <dig>  <cit>  suggesting that blockade of peroxide accumulation may be involved in the protective effects of antipsychotics reported here. however, results obtained using the dcf assay indicated that haloperidol  did not affect intracellular ros  accumulation whereas the well-known ginkgo biloba extract egb  <dig> that displayed potent antioxidant properties  <cit>  strongly reduced ros production . moreover, haloperidol and other antipsychotic drugs including -sulpiride and chlorpromazine did not protect hippocampal neurons from toxicity induced by h2o <dig>  in our model .

discussion
our data indicate that low concentrations of various antipsychotic drugs protect hippocampal neurons against toxicity induced by growth medium deprivation. to our knowledge, this is the first study that reports  on the neuroprotective effects of various neuroleptics having high affinity for the dopamine d <dig> and d <dig> receptor subtypes in hippocampal cultured neurons. these effects are apparently not linked to the inhibition of free radical production and may involve a caspase-associated mechanism.

the protective effects of antipsychotics are not likely to be related to their inhibitory action on σ1- or nmda receptor-mediated responses  <cit>  since neither ne- <dig> nor -mk- <dig> offered protection by themselves nor blocked the neuroprotective effects of haloperidol. on the other hand, our data suggest that d <dig> and/or d <dig> receptors mediate the effects of antipsychotic drugs in our model. first, rt-pcr data showed that d <dig> and d <dig> receptors are expressed in hippocampal neurons. these data are in agreement with previous studies reporting on the presence of these receptors subtypes in the hippocampal formation  <cit> . second, all antipsychotics tested here -raclopride and remoxipride) that display nm affinities for d <dig> and d <dig> receptors  <cit>  were neuroprotective to hippocampal neurons. third, -raclopride, a preferential d <dig> antagonist, almost completely blocked the neuroprotective effects of clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic with a particularly high affinity for the d <dig> subtype.

a preferential role for the d <dig> receptor in the neuroprotective effect of the various antipsychotics tested in our model is of special interest. haloperidol, risperidone, chlorpromazine, -butaclamol, domperidone and clozapine exhibit high nm affinities for this receptor sub-type  <cit>  and are potent neuroprotective agents in our model. moreover, l- <dig> , a rather selective d <dig> antagonist  <cit>  was found to be neuroprotective in our model while -raclopride and remoxipride which bind with only modest affinities to the d <dig> subtype  <cit>  were not effective. u  <dig>  a potent and selective d <dig> receptor antagonist, and sch  <dig>  a d <dig> antagonist, failed to be neuroprotective, suggesting that these two receptor subtypes do not mediate the protective effects of antipsychotic drugs in our model . interestingly, in the mature mammalian brain, the level of d <dig> receptors is greater than that of the d <dig> subtype in the hippocampal formation  <cit> . it would now be of interest to explore further the respective role of the d <dig> and d <dig> receptors in the neuroprotective effects of antipsychotics in hippocampal neurons using molecular approaches such as knock-out animals and sirna. we cannot exclude however the possibility that their neuroprotective ability may also be due to their purported α1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity  <cit>  which has been suggested to contribute to their clinical effect  <cit> . it has recently been shown that the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine attenuated cell death produced by h2o <dig> in pc <dig> cells through a mechanism that involves the upregulation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase  <cit> . although the effects of d2-like receptor antagonists were shared by antioxidants such as trolox  <cit>  and egb  <dig> , we found that they were ineffective against toxicity induced by h2o <dig> -sulpiride and chlorpromazine) and did not attenuate intracellular ros production , suggesting that the protective effects of antipsychotic drugs are not due to an antioxidant activity in our model. moreover, studies from animal models reported that olanzapine and risperidone, but not haloperidol, stimulated neurogenesis in rat brain areas   <cit>  and preserved cholinergic pathways and cognitive function, possibly by increasing levels of nerve growth factor   <cit> . this suggests that the promoting effects of antipsychotics -particularly atypical ones- on neuronal function may be also due to other mechanisms including stimulatory effect on neurotrophic factors. in support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that olanzapine and other atypical antipsychotics including clozapine, quetiapine and risperidone exerted protective effects in pc <dig> cells, possibly by decreasing the expression of the gene encoding for the neurotrophin receptor p <dig>  <cit> . this is of particular interest here since the p <dig> receptor has been reported to mediate hippocampal neuronal loss, possibly via the activation of caspases  <cit> . in support of an anti-apoptotic effect of antipsychotic drugs in our model, inhibitors of caspases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found to exert neuroprotective effects without affecting ros production. interestingly, it has recently been shown that clozapine and risperidone prevented apoptosis and dna damage induced by the apoptotic agent n-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium in pc <dig> cells, possibly by attenuating the activation of an enzyme known as glycosylase  <cit> .

although only obtained using an in vitro model, our data are in accordance with the view that treatment with atypical antipsychotics may improve cognitive functions in schizophrenia  <cit> . interestingly, only low concentrations of the various antipsychotics tested here, , were needed in our model to offer neuroprotection, much lower than those  used by others mostly in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . considering tissue penetration and the purported levels of antipsychotics found in rodent brains  <cit> , it is likely that upon repeated treatments, these drugs can reach levels that are sufficient to be neuroprotective.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data show that various d2-like receptor antagonists were able to protect primary hippocampal cultured neuronal cells against cell death induced by medium deprivation. further studies are necessary to confirm the role of d2-like  dopamine receptors and subsequent intracellular signaling pathways such as the inhibition of apoptosis-related effectors. our findings also support the hypothesis that antipsychotics could modulate, via their neuroprotective properties, cognitive status in schizophrenic patients.
