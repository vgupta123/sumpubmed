BACKGROUND
of the many strategies to defeat and bypass the blood brain barrier  for the purposes of drug delivery  <cit> , the unique biological and biophysical features of the choroid plexus , its intrinsic ability to produce cerebrospinal fluid  and its capacity to place bioactive proteins into csf  <cit>  have largely been ignored. more recently, there are a number of reports suggesting the possibility that secretory epithelial cells of the cp present a potential window into the central nervous system  for the purposes of drug delivery  <cit> . on one hand, if cp-epithelial drug targeting strategies could be developed and validated, then drugs, proteins and gene based medicines might be delivered to the cp for their translocation into csf and availability to brain parenchyma. alternatively, drug-targeting to the cp epithelial cells could be used to alter unique functions of cp epithelial cells that include csf production and the transport in, and out, of the cns of critical components like ions, vitamins, hormones and proteins like ascorbic acid, amyloid beta protein  <cit> .

in as much as csf-producing cp epithelia are distinct cellular structures within the cns and anatomically accessible via a fenestrated endothelium, we wondered whether phage display might be used to identify targeting ligands capable of delivering drugs into cp epithelial cells. as a first step towards this goal, our previous studies identified epidermal growth factor  as a potential ligand capable of mediating particle internalization into target cells  <cit>  and we showed its ability to enter cp epithelia in vitro and transduce them in vivo  <cit> . like the receptors for adenoviral and lentiviral gene delivery vectors which can also transduce choroid epithelial cells after i.c.v. injection  <cit> , the egf receptor is widely distributed. moreover, the ligand, egf, has intrinsic epidermal cell growth promoting biological activity  <cit>  that significantly limits its utility as a drug- and particle-targeting agent.

in this study, we attempted to validate an approach that might increase cp targeting specificity. to this end, we show that a combinatorial peptide library containing over  <dig> different peptides can be selectively mined for ligands that allow binding and internalization into mouse cp explants. three ligand-targeting phage recovered by biopanning have the capacity to target and internalize particles into cp epithelial cells in culture using tcsfb cells. furthermore, after i.c.v. injection into lateral ventricles, the targeted phage internalize into cp epithelial cells and ependyma cells. because the targeted binding is specific and dose dependent, the possibility arises that these targeted phage may be candidates to re-engineer cns gene delivery vectors and drug targeting to the cns.

RESULTS
biopanning phd-c7c libraries of phage for peptides internalizing into cp explants
as shown in table  <dig>  three recovered peptides named "peptide b" , "peptide c"  and "peptide d"  were selected from the  <dig> unique sequences obtained for further analysis from 3- <dig> rounds of biopanning on explants of 4th ventricle mouse choroid plexus. a 5th round of biopanning did not provide further enrichment of library collapse and was not studied. freshly dissected choroid plexus were incubated with the  <dig> ×  <dig> phage for  <dig> hours as indicated in materials and methods, unbound phage washed off and any phage particles that had not washed off were presumed to be internalized and were recovered by phage display biopanning  <cit> . no sequencing was performed after the first and second rounds of biopanning but of the  <dig> sequences obtained after round  <dig>  the data suggested that the original library had collapsed to  <dig> families of sequences of which  <dig> peptides  were identical. representing the family  <dig> of sequences, the candidate  was called "peptide b". on the 4th round of screening, this peptide b sequence  was not recovered but a peptide identified in round  <dig>  and representing family  <dig> sequences like r3p <dig>  r3p <dig>  r3p <dig>  and r3p <dig>  detected in round  <dig> was identified in round  <dig> . as such this sequence  was selected for further evaluation and called "peptide c". a 2nd identical member of this 4th family was detected in both rounds  <dig>  and  <dig>  and this peptide  was called peptide d. wild type phage with no peptide insert was called "peptide a" and each particle tested blind for binding and internalization.

peptide sequences obtained from after  <dig> and  <dig> rounds of biopanning were compared, assigned to one of six different families of sequences and repeat recoveries noted as described in the text.

targeted peptide phage are internalized by cells in cp explants
we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate whether the particles identified by biopanning internalized into cp explants and behaved as predicted . mouse cp were dissected from either the lateral or 4th ventricle as described in material and methods and incubated with the untargeted phage a or the peptide targeted b-, c- or d-particles at a concentration of  <dig> × 1011pfu/ml for  <dig> h at 37c. to remove any particles that might be non specifically bound to the cell surface, the explants were washed with pbs containing tween- <dig>  fixed in methanol and then immuno-stained with antibodies against m <dig> phage as described in materials and methods. binding of primary antibodies was detected using alexa594-goat anti-rabbit antibodies. as shown in figure  <dig>  little immunostaining is observed when choroid plexus explants are incubated with peptide-a  control phage . in contrast, immunoreactive m <dig> staining is observed in the cytoplasm of what appears to be selected populations of epithelial cells after incubation with particles targeted with peptide-b , peptide-c  or peptide-d  targeted phage indicating the internalization of these targeted particles by epithelial cells in the choroid plexus. we noted regional differences in the internalization and distribution of targeted cells in the explants with each targeted phage. while we consistently observed non-uniform internalization, it was not possible to determine whether this pattern represented restricted availability of particles to the explants or the existence of unique cell specific distributions of targeted receptors.

peptide-targeting is specific
as also shown in figure  <dig>  cp explants were treated with either media ,  <dig> ng/ml of synthetic peptide c  or  <dig> ng/ml of peptide-d  in addition to either  <dig> × 1011pfu/ml of peptide-c targeted phage  or  <dig> × 1011pfu/ml of peptide-d targeted phage  for  <dig> h at 37c. prior to staining, cells were washed with  <dig> mm glycine, ph  <dig> , fixed and immunostained with antibodies against m <dig> phage. binding of primary antibodies was detected using alexa594-goat anti rabbit antibodies. after  <dig> h, intense intracellular immunoreactivity was observed in cells incubated with phd c targeted phage  or peptide-d targeted phage . when explants were pretreated with either peptide-c  or peptide-d , no specific staining was observed in the explants indicating that the internalization of the peptide-c and peptide-d targeted phage was displaced by the excess peptide.

internalization of phd-targeted peptide phage in cp cells in vitro
to confirm epithelial cell targeting and to determine whether there existed specificity for epithelial cell subpopulations, rat choroid plexus epithelial cells from the tr-csfb cell line were incubated with peptide-a , peptide-b, peptide-c or peptide-d targeted phage  for  <dig> h at 37c, then acid washed to remove any particles on the cell surface, fixed and immunostained with antibodies against m <dig> phage . binding of primary antibodies was detected using alexa594-goat anti rabbit antibodies. no internalization is observed when the cells are treated with control phd a phage . significant intracellular immunoreactivity is observed in tr-csfb cells after incubation with phd b , phd c  or phd d . m <dig> phage, red; cell nuclei , white. the tr-csfb cells were also co-incubated with excess of free peptide-c  or peptide-d  and cells were washed with  <dig> mm glycine, ph  <dig> , fixed and then immunostained with antibodies against m <dig> phage. in both instances, internalization is almost completely blocked when the targeted particles are competing for binding to cell surface receptors with an excess of ligand.

internalization of phd targeted-phage is dose and time dependant
to evaluate the binding kinetics of phage internalization, tr-csfb cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of peptide-d-targeted phage for  <dig> h, at 37c . cells were acid washed to remove cell surface binding, immunostained with antibodies against m <dig> phage and detected using alexa <dig> goat labeled anti-rabbit antibodies. at  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml, little significant intracellular staining is observed  but at  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml  there is detectable immunoreactivity for m <dig> in the cytoplasm which clearly increases when the cells are incubated with  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml . this experiment shows that there is a clear dose dependant correlation between phage titer and intensity of intracellular immunoreactivity. similarly, if tr-csfb cells were incubated with peptide-d targeted phage  and acid washed, immunostained and visualized analyzed at different times, by  <dig> min, peptide-d-targeted phage are already internalized  and the intracellular staining increases by  <dig> h . by  <dig> h , there is a reduction on the amount of immunoreactive m <dig> which by  <dig> his negligible non detectable .

targeted phage are internalized by choroid epithelial cells and ventricular epithelial cells after icv injection
in figure  <dig>  control peptide-a  or targeted peptide-b , peptide-c  or peptide-d  phage were injected into the lateral ventricle of rats and  <dig> h later brains were collected and  <dig> um sections immuno stained with anti-m <dig> antibodies. very low immunoreactivity was observed in the choroid plexus after wild type phage injection . however, after p peptide-b , peptide-c  or peptide-d  targeted phage injections, strong m <dig> immunoreactivity was observed within most of the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. little staining is detected in brain parenchyma although non-specific targeting was detected at the level of the arachnoid membranes . very low immunoreactivity was observed in the ependymal cells after control phage injections  but after peptide-b targeted phage injections selected populations of ependymal cells were strongly stained for m <dig>  . after peptide-c targeted and peptide-d targeted phage i.c.v. injections, ependymal cells of the lateral ventricle clearly show intracellular and uniform immunostaining .

discussion
we selected three peptides to show that it is possible to identify drug-targeting candidates for cns drug delivery from a phage peptide library. our biopanning strategy for targeting generated over two dozen new sequences that we predicted would be biased for luminal targeting of cp epithelial cells because the screen used cp explants freshly dissected from donor mice. the three peptides were selected because they were found to have either increased representation in the limited number of clones sequenced  or alternatively whose sequences appeared after 3rd and 4th rounds of biopanning. these peptides, along with egf  <cit> , are proven capable of targeting cp epithelial cells in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. whether they can target cells for transduction after i.c.v. injection like egf  <cit>  remains to be established.

in  <dig>  smith  <cit>  conceived of phage display as a method whereby short nucleic acid sequences of dna could be inserted into the coding sequence of the m <dig> phage glll gene to generate particles that display on their capsid surface a peptide-plll fusion protein. reasoning that the displayed peptides would confer phage with new intrinsic activities, he proposed that it should be possible to introduce random and known sequences of dna into the glll gene to create particles with new activities. over the last twenty years, we and other investigators have been adapting this original phage display technique to identify novel peptides with different specificities and activities , for example, peptides have that confer physical stability to particles in organic solvents like chloroform, decrease complement activation of macromolecules in blood, modify immunogenicity, alter viral tropism in vitro and in vivo, internalize particles and transduce cells, promote transcytosis in vitro and in vivo and even promote transmigration of particles across cell barriers in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

our laboratories' focus has been to identify and exploit ligands that internalize into target cells with a long-term objective of improving the specificity of drug, protein and gene-based medicine delivery. to this end, we have re-engineered phage vectors for increased binding to mammalian cells and monitored their entry into cells by immunohistochemistry for internalization drug delivery, transfection for nucleotide delivery and transduction for gene expression  <cit> . it seemed reasonable to propose that these methods might deployed towards cns drug delivery because ligands like egf can target the phage particle to cells  <cit> .

several years ago, investigators  <cit>  proposed that it might be possible to target therapeutics to the cns by exploiting one of the unique features of the choroid plexus: it exists at the interface between blood and csf. if possible, drugs could then be designed to act like ascorbic acid and translocate across the cp epithelium for entry into csf and access to brain parenchyma  <cit> . alternatively, drugs could be targeted to the cp epithelium so as to modify its hydrodynamic and homeostatic functions in controlling csf production and composition respectively. we show here that when phage are re-engineered so that they can target the choroid plexus epithelium, they internalize into epithelial cells when tested in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. the targeting is ligand specific, concentration and time dependant.

the possibility of exploiting epithelial routes of drug delivery to the cns is not new. for example, we originally proved the concept of cp targeting with the ligand egf  <cit>  but it was clear from the outset that this ligand is not ideally suited for cp targeting. first, egf has intrinsic activity and is a naturally occurring growth factor. second, while egf may be selective for epithelial cells in the brain as described here, but there are several alternative cell types that express egf receptors including astrocytes, activated glia and endothelial cells. the specificity that we observe with i.c.v. injections is likely due to the compartmentalization of phage in the ventricular space and the limited number of cell types available for targeting. herenu et  <cit>  also explored the ependymal route for insulin like growth factor- <dig>  gene delivery in an attempt to circumvent the need to transport igf- <dig> from blood into brain by injecting peptide i.c.v.  <cit> . in this case, they exploited adenoviral selectivity to infect epithelial cells when injected i.c.v. to increase the levels of igf <dig> in csf and mimic the concentrations achieved by the injection of protein into csf. presumably, adenoviral-retargeting strategies that modify its pharmacokinetics, biological activity and even potency could be used to improve its use as a gene delivery agent to the cns.

in the study described here, we have not studied the mechanism of internalization or the specific trafficking of the particles once they enter the cell. the fact that the peptide ligand can prevent internalization suggests specificity for cell binding. the observation that the particles are internalized in a ligand dependant fashion supports the hypothesis that phage bind to cells via cognate receptors to the peptides displayed. the identity of these receptors remains unknown but clearly phage display should be considered as a viable method to identify novel portals of entry into the cns via delivery to cpe cells.

using the cp as a doorway into the cns has also gained momentum with significant difficulties in overcoming the blood brain barrier  <cit> . just as there are reports that propose using brain's endothelium as a target for cns drug delivery using molecular signatures <cit>  in brain endothelia, chen et al  <cit> showed that cns-directed enzyme therapy was feasible by targeting epitope-modified adeno-associated virus. while the effects are certainly local, the wide distribution of endothelium in the cns would ensure wide distribution of drug throughout the brain, if all endothelia were targeted. for similar reasons, there is considerable interest in targeting the choroid epithelium  <cit> . first, the design and structure of barriers are not homogenous throughout the brain and areas like the arcuate nucleus are open to csf while others, like median eminence, are open to the portal blood  <cit> . second, the choroid plexus is actively modulating csf content and composition in response to the environment  <cit>  which regulate brain state and neuroactive peptide distribution in csf <cit> . third, the choroid plexus can play a prominent role in neuroprotection  <cit>  because of special axonal endings that are formed at csf contacting neurons  <cit>  which presumably enable communication between brain parenchymal cells and csf. finally, ependymal cells, which divide asymmetrically and transfer progeny into the subventricular zone activated by injury  <cit>  are in direct contact with csf and cp produced neuroactive agents in csf. in as much as this subependymal zone is a neurogenic niche  <cit>  that is influenced by cp epithelial cells and an ependymal layer controlling of csf hydrodynamics and content, these cells are nearly ideally localized to modulate cns functions and treat brain disease if they can be targeted to produce therapeutics. as demonstrated by regev et al <cit> , lentiviral transduction of choroid plexus epithelium with genes encoding neuroactive peptides can control cns function thereby supporting the feasibility of cp-mediated drug delivery.

CONCLUSIONS
it is interesting to speculate that while our results support the feasibility of targeted delivery to choroid plexus epithelia and ependyma after i.c.v. injection of re-engineered particles, a more innovative therapeutic deployment would ideally involve exploiting epitopes on the basolateral epithelium that would allow targeting of particles from blood, through stroma and to the cp epithelial barrier. to this end, in vivo biopanning of basolateral cp epithelia at their stromal-endothelial interface using phage display libraries could be developed using homing techniques originally developed for vascular targeting described above  <cit> . inasmuch as these approaches have already proven useful for targeting brain endothelia to modify their function  <cit> , a similar strategy could be used to identify peptides capable of homing particles for drug transport to cp and translocation into csf.
