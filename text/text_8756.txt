BACKGROUND
haloacids are metabolic products of naturally occurring compounds  <cit>  and are also disinfection by-products of sewage and water  <cit> . it has been shown that some haloacids are toxic and mutagenic  <cit> . microorganisms capable of degrading these haloacids can be found in the natural environment. one of these, a soil-borne burkholderia sp., mba <dig>  has been isolated for its ability to grow on monobromoacetate   <cit> . this bacterium produces a haloacid dehalogenase that allows the cell to grow on mba. since mba is a more potent mutagen than ethylmethane sulfonate  <cit>  one would not expect an uptake mechanism for this kind of compound. we have, however, identified a haloacids-transporter protein gene downstream of the dehalogenase gene. this haloacid permease, deh4p, was expressed, together with the dehalogenase, to enhance the uptake of haloacetates  <cit> . the gene encoding for deh4p has been cloned and expressed in e. coli which facilitated the specific uptake of haloacetates  <cit> . deh4p is  <dig> residues long and has a putative molecular weight of  <dig>  and an isoelectric point of  <dig> .

with the blooming of the sequencing data and the development of bioinformatics, software that predicts the structure of a protein has become more and more readily available  <cit> . topology prediction programs that use different algorithms are easily accessible from the internet and their predictions are becoming more and more accurate. comparative analysis of the primary structure of deh4p with proteins in the pfam database  <cit>  has designated it as a member of the major facilitator superfamily  <cit>  . mfs is a major class of membrane transporter with more than a thousand known proteins  <cit> . it is also described as the uniporter-symporter-antiporter family. although there are many members in this family, only four of them have well defined structure or topology. these proteins are emrd  <cit> , lacy  <cit>  and glpt  <cit> , all from escherichia coli and oxlt from oxalobacter formigenes  <cit> . they have been shown to possess twelve transmembrane segments  with a 2-fold symmetry roughly dividing the first and the second 6-tms. the termini of these proteins were found to reside within the cytoplasm. though mfs transporters with  <dig> and  <dig> tms are known  <cit> , they are relatively few in number  <cit> . hence the presence of twelve tms was believed to be the standard characteristic of the mfs proteins.

notwithstanding the abundance and improved accuracy of those computer analysis methods, experimental determination is still necessary. the use of reporter fusion analyses is by far the most convenient method and the use of dual-reporters is no doubt a better choice than the use of a single indicator  <cit> . here we report the experimental determination of the topology of deh4p using a phoa-lacz dual-reporters system  <cit>  and the verification using a comparative approach.

RESULTS
hydropathy analysis of deh4p
computational analysis of deh4p has categorized it as a mfs protein. this classification was based on the following grounds. first, pfam  <cit>  analysis  indicated that deh4p is a member of the clan mfs and has a signature of pf <dig> sugar  transporter family. the signature, -x-g- -{v}-x-g-{kp}-x- -x- -x-  is found between residues  <dig> and  <dig> of deh4p  <cit> . second, the length of deh4p,  <dig> residues, is within the known range of  <dig> to  <dig> for mfs  <cit>  and third, it was predicted to have twelve tms, typical for mfs, by many topology prediction programs such as octopus  <cit> , tmpro  <cit> , sosui  <cit>  and phdhtm  <cit> . the monochloroacetate uptake ability of deh4p was inhibited in the presence of a proton motive force inhibitor, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenyl hydrazone . this suggested that deh4p is most likely a symporter or antiporter. when the topology of deh4p was predicted using tmhmm  <cit>  and sosui  <cit> , the models were different from a typical mfs symmetrical arrangement. deh4p has a long periplasmic loop, stretching from residues  <dig> to  <dig>  near the c-terminal. fig.  <dig> shows a hydrophobicity plot of deh4p using Δgpred algorithm  <cit> . the prediction showed that there were twelve tms with the n- and the c-termini located in the cytoplasm. all except tms  <dig> and  <dig> have reliability values of more than  <dig>  and the fifth periplasmic loop has a value of  <dig>  these suggested that the prediction was reasonably good and deh4p is likely to be a mfs protein.

topological analysis using deh4p-phoa-lacz fusions
although most of the predicted models of deh4p exhibited twelve tms it is necessary to validate these predictions experimentally. the use of reporter fusions technique is a commonly used practice. in this study we utilized a dual-reporters system. bacterial alkaline phosphatase  is an enzyme that functions only in the periplasmic space  <cit>  while β-galactosidase  is an enzyme that works only in the cytoplasm  <cit> . the use of these phoa-lacz dual-reporters in topology studies gives more reliable results than using just one reporter  <cit> . another problem in studying membrane protein is to achieve adequate expression. some fusion recombinants do not express  <cit>  while others can be toxic  <cit> . we have used a ribosomal promoter from burkholderia sp. mba <dig> for successful production of functional membrane protein in e. coli. this s <dig> promoter is a weak and constitutive promoter in e. coli and has been shown to be ideal for expression of potentially toxic membrane protein  <cit> . recombinant proteins made up of deh4p and truncated derivatives fused with phoa and laczα were constructed. the use of laczα decreased the sizes of the fusion proteins. with an appropriate host that allows α-complementation  <cit>  the laczα will work normally. dna fragments containing full-length and truncated deh4p of different lengths were amplified and cloned in-frame with the phoa-laczα dual reporter genes. thirty-six constructs were made. the truncation end points of the deh4p were designed to end in every putative tms or extra-membranous loops as predicted by the program sosui  <cit> . the end-points of these fusion proteins and their relative locations are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  e. coli transformants, each carrying a plasmid expressing a fusion protein  were shown to have similar growth rates in lb . moreover, the production of fusion proteins was confirmed with a color indicator plate containing x-phos  and red-gal™   <cit>  . this suggested that the presence of the plasmids or proteins was not affecting the general physiology of the cells.

e. coli cells carrying phku <dig> series plasmids were permeabilized with chloroform and sds and assayed for their phoa and lacz activities using p-nitrophenyl phosphate  and o-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside  as substrates, respectively. the enzymes activities were normalized using the highest activity as one . the relative enzymes activities are schematically shown in fig. 3a. there is without doubt that the expression levels among the various constructs vary from one to another. the relative strength of these two enzymes in a construct was expressed as a strength index which is the natural logarithm of the normalized activity ratio of phoa/lacz. the strength indexes of the constructs are shown as a bar-chart in fig. 3b. a positive strength index indicates high phoa activity and low lacz activity while a negative value shows the reverse situation. hence, when the strength indexes were sorted according to the end points of the truncated deh4p, the presence of a tms was implied each time the index reversed its sign. the absolute value of the index serves as a reliability indicator. if 75% of the reporters were properly localized, which is the recommended ratio for a reliable informative result  <cit> , the normalized activity ratio for phoa:lacz would be 1: <dig> or 3: <dig>  this ratio corresponds to a strength index of ±  <dig> . a strength index higher or lower than this boundary can be considered reliable. fig. 3b shows that the strength index changed its sign  <dig> times along the sequences of deh4p and the majority of the indexes lie beyond the ±  <dig>  boundary. the predicted topology and its relationship with the experimental results are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  among the  <dig> constructs,  <dig> of them had junction end points in the putative periplasmic loops, twelve of them ended in the middle of the tms and  <dig> of them ended in the putative cytoplasmic loops. all the  <dig> constructs that had the reporters in the putative cytoplasmic loops showed higher lacz activities than phoa activities. among the  <dig> constructs that ended in the putative periplasmic loops,  <dig> had higher phoa activities than lacz activities. two constructs, one with a fusion junction at t <dig> and the other at s <dig>  had higher lacz activities than phoa activities. they were mapped to the first and the last putative periplasmic loop, respectively. when the reporters ended in a putative tms, the lacz activity was generally higher than phoa activity regardless of the helices orientation. the only exception was observed when the reporters ended in putative tms  <dig> . this had higher phoa activity than lacz activity. the results also confirmed the presence of a long periplasmic loop stretching from residue  <dig> to  <dig>  in summary, among the thirty-six fusion proteins made, only those with end-points located in putative tms  <dig> and  <dig> and those in periplasmic loops  <dig> and  <dig> displayed contradictory results. in other words, the certainty of the presence of tms  <dig> and  <dig> was not verified.

comparative analysis of deh4p with metabolite:h+ symporter  family proteins
the current results failed to establish that deh4p contains twelve tms. in order to substantiate that deh4p is a mfs protein, bioinformatic analysis was also employed. previous comparative analyses of mfs proteins have identified specific sequence motifs  <cit> . a conserved motif of xgr  was identified between tms  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> of the mfs proteins. such a motif, migrk , was indeed identified between the predicted tms  <dig> and  <dig> of deh4p. a similar motif kigrk  was also found between the predicted tms  <dig> and  <dig> of deh4p . this motif was later expanded to a conserved region of ten residues - gxxxdrxgrr - found in all 12-helix mfs proteins  <cit> . a consensus motif of g- -l- - - - -g-r- - - -  was also expected for all mfs proteins  <cit> . this motif is found between residues  <dig> and  <dig> of deh4p. a blastp  <cit>  search  against the transporter classification database  <cit>  retrieved entries with high scores from the tc <dig> a. <dig>  metabolite:h+ symporter  family, subgroup of the tc <dig> a. <dig> mfs  <cit> . this subgroup of proteins was also predicted to have twelve tms. when the sequence of deh4p was compared with those of the mhs members by means of diagonal plots, homologous regions were revealed for all the comparisons . proteins cith , kgtp , pcat , prop , mopb , shia  and cita  exhibited homologous regions with deh4p especially at the n-terminal. this verified that deh4p is a mhs family protein. since mfs protein specific signature sequences  <cit>  were identified in deh4p, motif-based sequence analysis programs meme  <cit>  and mast  <cit>  were thus used to analyze deh4p and the mhs proteins. fig.  <dig> shows that there are seven motifs shared by deh4p and all the mhs members, with motif  <dig> found twice in every member. the signature of each motif is illustrated in logos format  <cit> . the order of these motifs was also common among deh4p and the mhs members. this verified that deh4p is without doubt a mhs family protein and is likely to have similar structure as other mfs proteins.

discussion
haloacid permease deh4p of burkholderia sp. mba <dig> was classified as a member of the mfs based on its sequence similarity  <cit> . it was predicted to have twelve tms. in this study dual-reporters - phoa-lacz - were used to study the topology of deh4p. thirty-six deh4p-phoa-lacz constructs were made and the fusion proteins expressed in e. coli. analyses of the phoa and lacz activities of these constructs verified that the n- and the c-termini were located in the cytoplasm. this is typical for many mfs proteins  <cit> . the experimentally determined topology of deh4p was, however, slightly different from typical mfs transporters. fusion proteins with deh4p junctions at g <dig>  t <dig> and s <dig> were expected to show a higher phoa than lacz activity. cells expressing these fusion proteins actually exhibited higher lacz activity. this suggested that the presence of the first and the eleventh tms was not verified. it is possible that these helices have a low average hydrophobicity. fig.  <dig> shows that this is indeed the case for tms  <dig> and  <dig> 

it can be argued that the presence of a lacz moiety affected the translocation and correct folding of the phoa, and thus its activity, in the periplasm. this is rather unlikely as only the laczα fragment was used. moreover, if this were true then the shorter the periplasmic loop the more likely that the phoa activity will be concealed. the second predicted periplasmic loop only has a size of one residue , and cells producing deh4p1-114-phoa-lacz has a positive strength index. this indicated that the dual-reporter registered the location of the periplasmic loop accurately. another concern arising from using enzymatic reporter assay for topology study is insufficient understanding of the details of membrane protein topogenesis. this concern is very real as current knowledge of topogenesis and membrane insertion mechanisms mainly comes from studies of eukaryotic cell organelles  <cit> . the topology of the transporter may alter if it is truncated and attached to another domain  <cit> .

inconclusive illustration of the presence of the tms by the fusion reporter system has been reported. when -phoa and -lacz fusions were constructed near the n-terminal of the na+/proline transporter putp of e. coli, similar enzyme activities were detected  <cit> . helix i of the e. coli α-ketoglutarate permease kgtp was not detected by a phoa fusion  <cit> . in this case the presence of positively charged residues in other tms was required to neutralize the negatively charged residues  in helix i in order to place the segment into the membrane correctly. similar negatively charged amino acids in deh4p  were predicted to be situated in the cytoplasm by the sosui program but were postulated to be part of helix i by the topcon program. it is possible that a similar effect was currently observed.

when the phoa-lacz reporter system was first developed, it was tested on the lacy protein. eight of the lacy-phoa-laczα recombinants had the reporters ending in the tms and seven of them were found to have higher phoa than lacz activities regardless of the orientation of the tms  <cit> . this is in contrast to the present study where higher lacz than phoa activities were detected in the majority of the recombinants with reporters that ended in the middle of a tms, regardless of the orientation of the tms . the inability of the method to mark the boundary of the tms and the tendency to have higher lacz activity suggested the risk of having tms omitted if insufficient number of constructs were made. the use of an e. coli strain, top <dig>  with a wildtype phoa gene did not affect the quantification of the phoa activities. the background enzyme level was negligible in all our experiments. this is similar to cases where a strain, tg <dig>  which has a wildtype phoa gene, was used  <cit> .

the use of a fusion reporter system also failed to characterize membrane protein with atypical features. helices e-f and p-q of the e. coli clca protein, which has a known 3-d structure, were not detected by phoa and green fluorescent protein fusions  <cit> . these helices may have formed helical hairpins  <cit>  and inserted into the membrane at a later stage of the folding  <cit> . further analysis is required to establish whether tms  <dig> and  <dig> of deh4p have a similar property. further examination of hydropathy  <cit>  and amphipathicity  <cit>  plots by visual inspection also revealed that deh4p may have less than twelve tms. high amphipathicity with high hydrophobicity were also observed for the first  <dig> residues. this is unusual since tms of structurally known mfs proteins lacy  <cit> , emrd  <cit> , glpt  <cit>  and oxlt  <cit>  have high hydrophobicity but not amphipathicity. these analyses suggested that deh4p may be an atypical mfs.

comparative analysis of deh4p with members of tc <dig> a. <dig>  group indicated that it shares a lot of common features with this group of mfs proteins. not only do they have seven conserved motifs, the organization of these motifs is also similar among the different members. motif  <dig>  which appeared twice, is the signature region linking tms  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> of all mfs proteins. these family-specific motifs demonstrated that deh4p is both a mhs and mfs protein. however, residues spanning  <dig> to  <dig> of deh4p are unique among the mhs. this region is the periplasmic loop of deh4p. a fasta  <cit>  and a blastp  <cit>  search of the protein database uniprot knowledgebase  using this loop sequence have identified putative mfs proteins only from the α-, β-, γ- and δ-proteobacteria. it is likely that this loop region is specific for the transporter proteins found in proteobacteria except the ε-class. the role of this loop awaits further study. the presence of such a loop near the c-terminal suggested that deh4p is not the result of simple tandem duplication and is atypical of mfs proteins. during the preparation of this manuscript deh4p has been designated as tc <dig> a. <dig> . <dig> to indicate its difference from the other mhs members.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of phoa-laczα dual reports is a simple and convenient method to determine the general topology of any membrane protein. together with bioinformatic analyses it is possible to produce a more reliable model for the protein being examined. deh4p has been demonstrated to be an atypical mfs protein with an asymmetric organization and a long periplasmic loop. although high-resolution structural study is ultimately required to elucidate the actual structure of deh4p with certainty, the current data are sufficient to conclude the major structural features of deh4p.
