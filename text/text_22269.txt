BACKGROUND
quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction   <cit>  has been the technique of choice to confirm or refute interpretations of relative gene expression derived from gene microarray data  <cit> , but accurate interpretation requires the qrt-pcr gene expression levels to be normalized against a stably expressed reference  <cit> . genes such as glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase , β-actin  and 18s rrna have been used as internal reference standards for qrt-pcr normalization mainly due to historical carryover, when they were used as references for semi-quantitative procedures like northern blots, rnase protection assays and conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions   <cit> . however expression of these genes is regulated according to cellular conditions  <cit> , and so their indiscriminate use as internal reference genes is questionable. many genes previously adopted as standards for normalization of gene expression data show variable expression according experimental conditions  <cit> , thus limiting their suitability. increasingly, it is viewed as imperative that the expression stability of prospective reference genes be verified under each all experimental conditions specific to a study  <cit> . gene expression analysis using microarrays facilitates use of an increasingly more complete range of sample variation criteria  <cit> , and studies using gene microarray analyses are an increasingly common means of identifying experiment-specific internal reference genes for use in pcr verification  <cit> .

few suitable reference genes have been identified within the rhesus macaque brain  <cit> . normalizer data for macaque brain tissues is sparse because the availability of genetic material from specific brain regions in properly controlled groups of macaques is very rare and difficult to obtain. to help overcome this problem, we recently used qrt-pcr and gene microarrays to examine expression stability for genes regulating γ-aminobutyric acid  trafficking in response to variation in circulating levels of ovarian steroids in the arcuate nucleus of the medial basal hypothalamus , hippocampus  and amygdala  in a study designed for examination of effects of hormone replacement therapy on gene expression . in the aforementioned analysis  <cit> , we showed that qrt-pcr results normalized using genes showing high microarray expression stability  mirrored relative microarray expression data normalized using the quantile method  <cit>  as part of robust multichip analysis  pre-processing  <cit>  on the affymetrix® genechip® rhesus macaque genome array   <cit> .

we now present further details of our qrt-pcr relative expression stability analyses using the software algorithm bundles: genorm  <cit> , normfinder  <cit>  and bestkeeper  <cit> . we compare these data with relative gene expression stabilities from quantile-normalized rma pre-processed  microarray results from the same  study examined using the rhesus genechip®. in addition we compare relative expression stabilities from a separate study of normally cycling macaques  where we conducted microarray analysis of the same brain regions  using the affymetrix® genechip® human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  microarray .

in order to maximize the likelihood of detecting gene sequences that are stably expressed under a variety of conditions , gene selection was limited to a published set of  <dig> human genes expressed under all conditions tested  <cit> , and expected to meet criteria for "housekeeping" genes. our goal was to identify the most appropriate normalizer or combination of normalizers for gene expression comparisons, and we selected these criteria to limit inclusion of probe sets to those most likely to be good candidates under variable conditions  <cit> . the experiments conducted in the current study were designed to test effects of variable ovarian hormone exposure on the function of three brain areas, and we used menstrual cycle variation and hormone therapy effects as two ways of independently assessing ovarian hormone effects.

RESULTS
the results were obtained from two different experiments, which are described in the methods and depicted schematically in figure  <dig>  previously qrt-pcr was conducted on samples from the hrt study in order to examine the influence of hormone replacement on gene expression of gabaergic system components  <cit> . qrt-pcr relative expression stabilities of the six gabaergic components and three normalizers used in the prior qrt-pcr analysis were assessed in the current study, and we compare analyses for these nine genes  used for qrt-pcr to analyses of  <dig> housekeeping genes examined using gene microarray data pre-processed using robust multiarray analysis   <cit> . differences in annotation quality between the rhesus and human microarray platforms facilitated higher discrimination in probe set selection using the human compared to the rhesus genechip®. because the nature of the probe sets used can affect overall relative expression stability values  <cit> , we conducted separate analyses according to annotation-based on probe set selection criteria and present the gene microarray results according these selection methods. on both the human and rhesus genechip® we compared: 1) all probe sets annotated for the housekeeping genes; and 2) probe sets annotated for "popular normalizers" . in addition to analysis of all probe sets annotated for housekeeping genes, the annotation quality of the human genechip® facilitated selection of "most representative" probe sets  for the majority of the housekeeping genes as well as all of the popular normalizers. use of the representative probe sets was intended to increase the specificity of data used for analyses.

qrt-pcr. hrt genorm analysis
five of the original set of nine genes preselected for analysis showed initial expression stability  values  <cit>  within the recommended range  for consideration as a normalizer  <cit> . where lower m indicates higher expression stability, initial m-value ranks  were as follows: alg <dig> <gapdh <rpl13a <gad <dig> <gabra <dig>  sequential stepwise exclusion of the least stable reference genes resulted in final m-values of  <dig>  for alg <dig> and rpl13a, indicating that either of these genes was equally suitable for selection as the most stably expressed gene  according to the genorm algorithm. due to high variance introduced by a single mbh sample, it was removed and reanalysis was performed. the only effect of this change on relative m-values was regarding relative ranks of gad <dig> and gapdh with gapdh showing higher stability after variation reduction . alg <dig> and rpl13a remained the most stably expressed genes.

qrt-pcr. hrt normfinder analysis
alg <dig> showed the highest stability when all three brain regions were compared. when all nine genes were analyzed, the five most stably expressed ones were identically ranked whether or not they were grouped  <cit>  by brain region. the normfinder algorithms work most efficiently when all genes used show high expression stability. from these nine genes, the five most stably expressed ones were selected. normfinder algorithms were then applied to these five genes in order to narrow down the three most stably expressed. because use of stably expressed genes is important for normfinder function, we used this sequential method to ensure selection of genes with expression patterns that maximized the effectiveness of the normfinder algorithm  <cit> . where the top five gene candidates were considered separately, alg <dig> was still the most stably expressed  and the most stable combination  was gapdh + rpl13a . where only the three prospective internal reference genes were considered, alg <dig> was again the most stably expressed , and the most stable combination  was gapdh and alg <dig> 

§ = alg <dig>  rpl13a, gapdh, gabra <dig> and gabra <dig>  * = alg <dig>  rpl13a and gapdh

in comparisons of inter-group and intra-group variation  gapdh showed the highest variability in the mbh  with intra-group variation an order of magnitude higher than that observed for other genes.

qrt-pcr. hrt normfinder test of separate brain regions
normfinder analysis of inter-group and intra-group variation highlighted the possibility that the most appropriate internal reference gene would vary according to brain region. for the mbh gene expression analysis, alg <dig> was ranked as the most stably-expressed gene in all scenarios. i.e., when all nine genes were included, when only the five most stable genes were selected, or when selection was restricted to the three prospective internal reference genes . for the hpc and amd gene expression analysis, gapdh was ranked as the most stably-expressed gene, with the most stable combination being gapdh and rpl13a. when only the three prospective internal reference genes were considered, gapdh was again ranked as the most stably-expressed gene, with the best combination of gapdh and alg <dig> .

qrt-pcr. hrt normfinder deviant sample test
causes for observed differences in relative expression stability of the most stably expressed genes in the mbh compared to in the extra-hypothalamic regions  were elucidated by analysis of intra-group variation . as previously described, we tested the influence of this variation by omitting the sample contributing the most to mbh gene expression variability. with this omission, gapdh showed the highest overall expression stability, and as before, stability rankings were identical with and without regional grouping considerations. in the omission test, gapdh was also the most stable  when the  <dig> most stable genes were compared. the most stable combination was gapdh + rpl13a . however, when group comparisons were limited to prospective internal reference genes only, the most stable single gene was again alg <dig>  with the most stable combination being gapdh + alg <dig> .

qrt-pcr. hrt bestkeeper analysis
in the analysis of all three brain regions, only the predicted housekeeping genes gapdh, rpl13a and alg <dig> met bestkeeper crossing point  <cit>  standard deviation recommendations  < 1) for consideration as stably expressed genes. rpl13a displayed the lowest indices of variation . aside from the three prospective internal reference genes, gad <dig> and gabra <dig> showed the next highest expression stability. in light of findings from the normfinder analysis, the mbh was analyzed separately from the extra-hypothalamic regions. for the separate mbh gene expression analysis, five genes met bestkeeper recommendations based on cp standard deviation for consideration as internal reference genes. they were ranked as follows, from lowest-to-highest variation : gabra <dig>  alg <dig>  rpl13a, gabra <dig> and gabrd. however, when the most deviant mbh sample was omitted, alg <dig> and rpl13a received highest  relative stability rankings followed by gabra <dig>  gabra <dig> and gabre. for the extra-hypothalamic hpc and amd analysis, the five genes with lowest crossing point standard deviation from lowest to highest variation were rpl13a, gapdh, alg <dig>  gabre and gabrd.

discussion
qrt-pcr
using three popular algorithms, we assessed relative gene expression stability across the three brain regions, to identify genes that met or exceeded criteria commonly used for selection of internal reference genes used for qrt-pcr normalization  <cit> . in each case the prospective internal reference genes rpl13a, gapdh and alg <dig> were found to be more reliable normalizers than the selected genes for gabaergic system components  <cit> , with the exception was gad <dig>  which was ranked as being more stably expressed than gapdh using genorm. we suspected that this stems from the variation in gapdh expression in the mbh, which the normfinder intra-group analysis showed to be an order of magnitude higher than the variation in the expression of other examined genes. reduction of sample variance, by removal of the most deviant mbh value produced a genorm ranking where gapdh was more highly ranked than gad <dig> 

the finding that higher gene expression variability occurred in the mbh compared to the extra-hypothalamic regions  was consistent with findings from a principal components  analysis of gene expression during phases of the rhesus macaque menstrual cycle  <cit>  under conditions of the current study.

microarray evaluation
probe sets annotated for rps27a/ubiquitin were stably expressed in both studies and provide basis for comparing results in the human and rhesus genechips®. note that in analysis of cycle study data grouped by region, probe sets for rps27a/ubiquitin do not appear in the top  <dig> most stably expressed probe sets when all probe sets were considered . however the rps27a/ubiquitin probe set '200633_at' appears as the 26th most stably expressed of the  <dig> probe sets tested, and was extremely highly expressed with a rating of "++++" . comparatively, in the hrt study using the rhesus genechip®, the probe set 'mmugdna. <dig> .s1_at' was annotated as "similar to ubiquitin and ribosomal protein s27a", and showed expression levels below mas  <dig>  analysis detection limits . however another similarly annotated probe set  was highly expressed, had a regional expression stability of  <dig>   and a treatment expression stability of  <dig>   . the rhesus macaque annotations for both of these probe sets are based on a macaca fascicularis sequence annotated by comparison to the human sequence listed under refseq id .

a detailed examination of the netaffx annotation did not clarify if these probe sets interrogate the rps27a sequence solely, or the rps27a/ubiquitin fusion sequence. note that ubiquitin is covalently bound to proteins targeted for posttranslational modification or degradation, and influences the intracellular localization and stability of proteins. the ubiquitin gene can be fused to a ribosomal protein gene, and this fusion gene may be referenced by rps27a probe sets in the on the affymetrix® arrays.

affymetrix® arrays contain redundant probe sets that interrogate different regions of the same gene  <cit> , and reflect differential regulation of alternative script production based on alternative splicing or polyadenylation  <cit> . screening using qualitative present vs. absent calls from mas <dig>  analysis can improve reliability of evaluation among redundant probe sets  <cit> .

probe sets for the same gene commonly show differences in expression levels  <cit> . for well annotated genes like actb, these probe set sequences are likely to be accurate, and microarray analysis may be detecting variations in expression stability along different portions of the same sequence  <cit> . although annotation of rhesus genechip® probe sets are based on sequences defined using the human genechip® as a template  <cit> , annotation of many probe sets for the rhesus genechip® are inferred and are frequently separated from verified sequences by more levels of interpretation than is the case for the human genechip®  <cit> . for the rhesus macaque, annotation reliability of the subset of the rhesus genechip® probe sets that have been verified using rhesus macaque tissues may exceed the reliability of probe sets annotated on the human genechip®. however full annotation of the rhesus genechip® is still a work in progress  <cit>  and to date, large numbers of functional rhesus macaque transcripts may be more reliably interrogated using the human genechip®.

robust normalizers identified by microarray analysis
in the cycle study, the occurrence of four highly expressed, well annotated actg <dig> probe sets ranked among the top  <dig> most stably expressed sequences in both analytical groupings, causes actg <dig> to meet criteria for what we propose to call a "robust normalizer". i.e., multiple segments of the same gene  <cit>  show high expression stability across all experimental conditions.

identification of a robust normalizer  was accomplished using the human but not the rhesus genechip®. in contrast, probe sets annotated for rps27a showed high stability across all tissues and conditions used in both experiments . however, annotation on the rhesus genechip® was insufficient for exploration of robustness as a potential normalizer.

twelve annotations from among the various selections of " <dig> most stably expressed" were common to both experiments . within the cycle study, multiple probe sets for the clathrin light chain  were observed among the  <dig> most stably expressed under two methods of probe set selection, and were robustly expressed using mas  <dig>  detection .

popular normalizers
in both studies, the expression stabilities of popular normalizers were spread across much of the range observed in the overall pool of housekeeping genes. as a group, the popular normalizers did not show tendencies to be more stably expressed than the larger pool of housekeeping genes .

probe sets for rps27a and rpl <dig> showed high stability rankings among the popular normalizers for all analyses in both studies . in analysis of the most representative probe sets for the cycle study, the appearance of clusters  of probe sets for popular normalizers rps27a, rpl13a, arhgdia, actb and gapdh showing high expression stability  under both regional and phase-based analyses prompted us to identify these genes as robust normalizers among the subset of popular normalizers.

probe sets for actb and gaphd are well annotated and used as controls on the rhesus genechip®  <cit> , however probe sets for these genes show a high range of expression stabilities . the significance of variable expression among well annotated probe sets for the same gene is under evaluation  <cit> . possibly related to this probe set variability in expression and expression stability, we found sequences for actb and gapdh to be problematic in qrt-pcr normalization of the hrt study .

comparison between qrt-pcr and microarray data
under all selection criteria used in the current study, we indentified probe sets for genes more stably expressed than probe sets for genes  that we showed to be well suited for qrt-pcr normalization based on high concordance with microarray results, as well as relative expression stability comparisons using three algorithms designed for this purpose  <cit> . interestingly, when all rhesus genechip® probe sets were restricted to those for popular normalizers, rpl13a and gapdh were among the more highly ranked  and showed high expression . additional genes may be open for consideration given that many probe sets on the rhesus genechip® were more stably expressed than the probe sets for rpl13a, alg <dig> and gapdh. in addition, the probes used for qrt-pcr were derived from the same ncbi sequences as the rhesus genechip® probe sets. the noticeable rank separation of alg <dig> from rpl13a and gapdh in the hrt study emphasizes the importance of considering that all genes included in the normfinder analysis influence systemic variation which affects relative ranking  <cit> .

note that how representative we considered a probe set to be was based on the cumulative record of annotation history associated with the probe set. other investigators performing gene expression comparisons using approximately  <dig> genes showed high correlation between results from multiple microarray platforms  and taqman® qrt-pcr results. in addition, high correlations between qrt-pcr and microarray results using rma-normalized log 2-transformed data in nonhuman primates have been demonstrated elsewhere  <cit> . the use of publicly available microarray data provides a selection method that is independent of the microarray platform or normalization methodology, and is able to cope with gene lists that overlap only partially  <cit> . we considered genes showing both low and high expression in addition to high expression stability because the data range between the minimum and maximum expression levels could have a profound influence on normalizer calibration. although pairwise gene expression stability measures account for effects of large differences in expression levels  <cit> , having a small range of control gene expression values can skew comparative detection sensitivity.

it is important to note that other methods would likely detect stably expressed genes from the current study which are not included in the published set of  <dig> human housekeepers. however, our goal was for current study to identify candidates likely enough to be stably expressed over experimental variation so as to allow us to best manage pcr for future macaque studies involving these brain regions, where additional microarray analysis may not be feasible.

CONCLUSIONS
using gene microarray analysis of two experiments, we ranked expression stability of sequences for  <dig> published housekeeping genes under six sex-steroid environments in three regions of the rhesus macaque brain. sequences for popularly used normalizing genes did not tend to be more stably expressed than sequences from the overall pool of housekeeping genes, and probe set expression stability values for multiple genes frequently overlapped. although annotation quality of the rhesus genechip® was not sufficient to facilitate detection of robust normalizers, comparisons of relative expression stability values for the same genes between the rhesus and human genechips® were possible. robust normalizer candidates were identified using the human genechip®. for example, in the cycle study, multiple probe sets for actg <dig> were stably expressed under all conditions in all brain regions at levels allowing easy detection. therefore we recommend actg <dig> as a robust normalizer for examination of mbh, hpc and amd under changing ovarian hormonal conditions. comparatively, in both studies, probe sets for rps27a were stably expressed under all conditions in all three brain regions at levels allowing easy detection, and may be the normalizer of choice for mbh, hpc and amd comparison between both experiments. however, further examination of probe set annotation quality for this gene is recommended.

in summary, we identified multiple genes that were more stably expressed across more experimental conditions and showed less probe set expression variability than popularly used genes meeting typical requirements for qrt-pcr normalization. these findings demonstrate uses for well annotated gene microarray data in addressing widely documented problems associated with the selection of experimentally specific internal reference genes.
