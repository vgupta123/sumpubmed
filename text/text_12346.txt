BACKGROUND
visceral leishmaniasis  is endemic in  <dig> countries with  <dig> million people at risk around the world and  <dig>  are infected/year . more than 90 % of visceral leishmaniasis  occurs in seven countries: india, bangladesh, nepal, sudan, ethiopia, kenya and brazil . leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of leishmania genus. vl also known as kala-azar in india, is the most severe form of leishmaniasis  and anthroponotic transmission  occurs. whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates of leishmania donovani and leptomonas has previously been completed in our lab  <cit> . an important insight gained through this effort was the confirmation of co-infection of leptomonas with the visceralizing leishmania species. this disturbing trend has been reported so far only in india  hinting towards zoonotic spread of the disease and indicates that leptomonas may be a new pathogen. in such a situation the question remains that a changed paradigm in chemotherapy should be adopted targeting the co-infections.

leptomonas is monogenetic kinetoplastid parasite of insects and primitive in comparison to leishmania  <cit>  and these two parasites arose from a common ancestor as shown in fig.  <dig>  <cit> . at some time during the evolution, leishmania appears to have lost the ability to be transmitted in nature from invertebrate host to another and adapted to a life cycle alternating between invertebrate and vertebrate host  <cit> . with the availability of complete genome sequence with us of these two kinetoplastids  <cit>  representing important evolutionary branch points viz leishmania and leptomonas, in this study we have analyzed the enzymes prenyltransferases  of these kinetoplastids. cellular organization and signaling in both unicellular and multicellular organisms is heavily influenced by the ras superfamily of small gtp-binding proteins. these proteins have a structurally and mechanistically preserved gtp-binding core despite considerable divergence in sequence and function  <cit> . protein trafficking pathways are frequently exploited by human pathogens to gain entry and survive within host cells  <cit> . studying the evolution of protein trafficking is essential to understand the origins of eukaryotes. among trafficking-associated proteins, the rab family expanded most in evolution, suggesting that it provided the primary diversification element in the evolution of trafficking  <cit> . the prenylation pathway remains largely unexplored in kinetoplastida. therefore, it was of interest for us to carry out the phylogenetic profiling of rab geranylgeranyltransferase  and rab proteins in both leishmania and its sister leptomonas. in this study we used a classification and phylogeny based approach to define subfamilies of rabggtase and rab proteins, we built evolutionary trees using maximum likelihood and distance based methods. we provide a comprehensive view of rabggtase and rab evolution for sister leptomonas and with various leishmania species. since, drugs that inhibit enzymes involved in protein prenylation could be interesting antiparasitic agents; we used one specific known inhibitor of rabggtase to predict the structure activity relationship with the parasite enzyme.fig.  <dig> overview of the leishmania complex; classification of the leishmania genus, subgenus and species complex   <cit> . both kinetoplastids leishmania donovani and leptomonas arose from a common ancestor



RESULTS
kinetoplastid genome phylogeny
we compared the genomes of leishmania species to leptomonas in order to obtained information on kinetoplastid phylogeny . crithidia was taken as an outgroup. we observed that the l. donovani isolate from india was placed at the crown in comparison to leptomonas.fig.  <dig> kinetoplastid genome phylogeny. a cladogram depicting kinetoplastid phylogenetic relationships among genome of crithidia fasciculate, leishmania aethiopica, leishmania amazonensis, leishmania arabica , leishmania braziliensis, leishmania enriettii, leishmania gerbilli, leishmania donovani, leishmania major, leishmania mexicana, l. sp. mar lem <dig>  leishmania tarentolae, leishmania tropica , leishmania turanica and leptomonas seymouri




leishmania donovani and leptomonas farnesyltransferase
in leishmania donovani, α-subunit of farnesyltransferase  was located on chromosome  <dig>  with accession number xp_ <dig> . in leptomonas α-subunit of ftase  was identified from the contig  of leptomonas genome. using clustalw, percent identity of the α-subunit of ldftase and leptomonas ftase with l. major  and l. infantum  was summarized in fig. 3a and it can be seen that the region of sequence identity was found extensively at the c terminus .fig.  <dig>

β-subunit of ftase in leishmania donovani  was located on chromosome  <dig>  with accession number xp_ <dig> . in leptomonas, β-subunit of ftase  was identified from the contig  of leptomonas genome. using clustalw, percent identity of the β-subunit of ldftase and leptomonas ftase with l. major  and l. infantum  was summarized in fig. 3a. in comparison with the α-subunit of ftase among l. major, l. infantum and l. donovani the β-subunit showed more sequence identity . it is also reported that the β-subunit of prenyltransferases are more conserved than α-subunit  <cit> . the β-subunit appears to have invariable domain architecture throughout evolution and its invariable nature is due to functional rather than structural constraints.

leishmania donovani and leptomonas geranylgeranyltransferase
using clustalw, percent identity of the α-subunit of ldggtase-ii  with l. major  and l. infantum  was summarized in fig. 3b. α-subunit of this enzyme was totally conserved between the two visceral species l. donovani and l. infantum but quite variable between the cutaneous l. major and visceral species . non conservative amino acids alanine and serine at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of the visceral species were replaced by valine and threonine in the cutaneous species respectively . it has been reported by peterson et al. that parasites harboring a pair of point mutations from ala- <dig> to val- <dig> and from ser- <dig> to thr- <dig> are resistant to cycloguanil  <cit> . a similar substitution in α-subunit of ggtase-ii could be responsible for its survival and multiplication within the host cell. no sequence identity was observed to α-subunit of ggtase-ii in leptomonas genome with l. major , l. infantum  and ldggtase-ii .

in our study, the β-subunit of ggtase-ii of l. donovani was totally conserved in both the leishmania species responsible for the visceral manifestation of the disease viz. l. infantum  and l. donovani . the carboxy terminal of this enzyme was completely conserved between the visceral  and cutaneous species  of leishmania  however in the n-terminal, differences in the cutaneous species were observed. non conservative amino acids aspartate and glycine at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the visceral species were substituted in the cutaneous species . the susceptibility to infection by leishmania nramp <dig> gene has been similarly reported  <cit>  to be substitution in non conservative amino acid aspartate and glycine. a similar substitution in β-subunit of ggtase-ii maybe due to the different requirement for mode of protein trafficking.

percent identity of the β-subunit of ggtase-ii in leptomonas to old world l. major  and l. infantum  is shown . new world, l. panamensis  and l. braziliensis , showed 81 % identity with leptomonas whereas in l. donovani identity with only old world was observed.fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of ggtase-ii  of leishmania donovani  with its sister leptomonas  showing conserved regions  based on percentage identity



the evolutionary relationship between ftase and ggtase-ii of leishmania and leptomonas was reconstructed by using neighbor-joining method . in our study, α-subunit of ftase between leishmania and leptomonas were in close phylogeny. but as regards to the holoenzyme, α-subunit was placed very differently to the β-subunit of these enzymes. we concluded that α-subunit of ggtase-ii is almost similar to the corresponding α-subunit of ftase in both kinetoplastids. β-subunit of ggtase-ii is very similar to the corresponding β-subunit of ftase in both kinetoplastids.fig.  <dig> we reconstructed the evolutionary relationships between ftase and ggtase-ii of leishmania and leptomonas by using neighbor-joining method



rab sequence mining in l. major and l. infantum
among the prenylation proteins, rabs are small gtp-binding proteins which are the largest family within the ras superfamily. these act as membrane associated molecular switches and regulate vesicular trafficking . the number of rab proteins and gene complexity in an organism has been correlated with multicellularity of organism. a multicellular organism will require/have higher number of rabs encoded by its genome  <cit> . plasmodium falciparum has been shown to encode  <dig> rabs, toxoplasma gondii encodes  <dig> rabs, leishmania encodes  <dig> rabs, drosophila melanogaster encodes  <dig> rabs, and homo sapiens encodes >  <dig> rab proteins, which correlates with their multicelluarity and organism structural complexity.

until now, despite the importance of the intracellular vesicle transport in leishmania pathogenicity, very few publications are available regarding number, diversity, complexity and functions of leishmania rab gene family . therefore, it was of interest for us to carry out the phylogenetic profiling of the rab repertoire in the lower eukaryote leishmania. the exhaustive mining of leishmania rab proteins in genedb  and ncbi  database revealed many full length proteins, some were annotated as rabs of various families, but most were annotated as putative rabs or rab like proteins, in this aspect the l. major rabs are better annotated compared to l. infantum rabs. our search retrieved  <dig> completely annotated rabs in l. major whereas  <dig> rabs are reported in l. major by berriman et al.  <cit> . similarly in l. infantum, we found  <dig> proteins annotated as rabs and few other proteins annotated as putative rab or rab like proteins. the details of rabs of both l. infantum and l. major, along with name, accession number, gene id and chromosomal location in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

rab sequence mining in leishmania and leptomonas
from our whole genome sequence of l. donovani and leptomonas some rabs were annotated as rabs of various families, but most were annotated as putative rabs or rab like proteins. we retrieved  <dig> completely annotated rabs in l. donovani . similarly in leptomonas, we found  <dig> proteins annotated as rabs . the details of rabs of both l. donovani and leptomonas are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig> and s <dig> respectively. a pair wise comparison of the rab proteins retrieved from the l. major  and l. infantum , l. donovani  and leptomonas  were calculated and phylogenetic tree was constructed using the rabs orthologues sequences of l. major, l. infantum, l. donovani and leptomonas .fig.  <dig> heat-map depicting percent identity between a
l. major and b

to visualize the synteny in rab genes between leishmania donovani and leptomonas, we constructed a circos plot linking the homologous rab genes  the rab genes of leptomonas are represented on the left side and rab genes of leishmania donovani are represented on the right side. rab <dig>  rab <dig> gtp and rab <dig> showed extensive synteny in both the species. rab <dig> and rab <dig> of leishmania donovani have no similarity with any genes in leptomonas. whereas few genes in leishmania donovani are partially similar such as rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab11b, rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab2a and gtp binding rab <dig> to leptomonas.

thirteen annotated rabs of l. major and l. infantum were exactly the same as in l. donovani, only rab  <dig> was present in l. major but was not identified in either of the visceral leishmania. what does rab  <dig> do? the explanation for this has been addressed in the phylogeny section. in leptomonas  <dig> rabs could be annotated by us, all of them same as found in leishmania.

phylogenetic analysis of rab gtpase
an important role in evolution is played by small gtpases belonging to the ras superfamily. rab proteins form the largest branch of the ras superfamily. this family is much diversified  <cit> . each rab protein has a distinct subcellular location and is responsible for a specific transport step  <cit> . rab proteins are key regulators of intracellular vesicular transport and membrane trafficking in exocytic and endocytic pathways . the evolution of rab proteins has been analyzed extensively in trypanosomes  <cit>  but not in leishmania. we believe that molecular phylogenetic analysis of rab proteins would provide a unique opportunity for finding the relationship between evolution of leishmania and leptomonas. leishmania is believed to have evolved from leptomonas where life cycle changed from monogenetic to digenetic  <cit> . our study is the first extensive data mining and phylogenetic construction of clinical isolates of leishmania and leptomonas which is based on annotation of rabs obtained from our whole genome sequencing  <cit> .

the orthologues which correspond to genes separated by divergence of the leishmania rab superfamily in comparison with leptomonas is shown in fig. 7a. we found that the core rab repertoire associated with basic endocytosis and exocytosis is fully conserved  <cit> , the endomembrane system appears to be very ancient and maintained same for leishmania and leptomonas, whilst gene duplication has facilitated the building of additional, lineage-specific complexity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
a phylogenetic relationship between rab sequences of leishmania and leptomonas which is based on multiple sequence alignment . a dotted line on a phenogram indicates a negative branch length, a common result of averaging and seed  <dig> indicates “random seed: this option makes bootstrapping consistent with the clustal interface. the random seed is the value that initializes the pseudo-random number generator. choosing the same seed causes the generator to produce exactly the same sequence of numbers for a given set of distances and hence the same result. choosing a different seed value produces an alternative sequence of numbers which should introduce some variation in the result, but it should be similar. the highly conserved values show which parts of the tree should be given greater confidence”. preps analysis  between rab 2a and rab11b of leishmania showed that b rab11b lacks the cysteine residue at c terminus of caax signal sequences which is essential for prenylation. c rab 2a has cysteine residue at c terminus of caax signal sequences



out of  <dig> rabs reported to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor   <cit> , five rabs are said to be present in any well characterized genome. the core set includes a conserved mechanism for er to golgi transport , trafficking through the early endosome , recycling , delivery to the late endosome/lysosome  and retrograde transport through the golgi complex   <cit> . inspection of the tree in fig. 7a reveals that major groups of rab proteins in the leishmania genome can be broadly related to leptomonas rabs by homology thus indicating similar function and/or subcellular localization. this co-segregation of rab gtpases according to common functions rather than to taxonomic relationships indicates a conserved mechanism of rab interaction with regulators/effectors across evolution  <cit> . orthologues of rabs in leishmania and leptomonas e.g. rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig> co-segregated with a strong bootstrap support. this observation suggests that strict phylogeny of function in the rab superfamily has been maintained and steps required for the basic vesicular transport were almost same in both these kinetoplastids. these core set of rabs also appear to be orthologues of mammalian rabs  <cit> . remarkably high level sequence conservation is retained between these two kinetoplastids and higher eukaryote orthologues. parasites  have ~  <dig> rabs gene and most of which are clearly orthologues with metazoan rabs  <cit> . rab <dig> is ancient rab protein that arose before the speciation event separating trypanosomes from the mammalian lineage  <cit>  and is maintained in the kinetoplastid leishmania and its sister species leptomonas. rab <dig> is lost in kinetoplastids  <cit> .

non-essentiality of the different rab isoforms was observed in both the kinetoplastid genomes but which is observed to be a major contribution in the rab repertoire of other organisms. we found isoform of rab <dig>  and its orthologues with leptomonas in the crown position of phylogenetic tree. isoform of rab <dig>  in leishmania and leptomonas takes basal position in the tree. preps analysis  of these protein showed that rab11b lacks the cysteine residue at c terminus of caax signal sequences which is essential for prenylation . on blastp analysis with the well annotated human rab family, this rab11b of l. donovani, showed 58 % identity with rab like protein 2a isoform x <dig> . therefore we determined that the rab11b as annotated in leishmania and leptomonas genome is actually not rab11b but an ancient isoform of rab2a. maybe this protein has conserved gtpase activity and as it evolved to rab2a  it acquired specific prenylation activity . alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been reported. evolutionary distance of the lineage requires experimental evidence to further support these sequence data. it has been established by diniz et al.  <cit> : that rab <dig> and rab11b  are actin interacting proteins  in l. infantum and l. major.

rab <dig> is an early endosome marker as established by real et al.  <cit> : in leishmania major and leishmania amazonensis. from our study we found only rab <dig> annotation in the genomes of both the kinetoplatids. in l. donovani rab <dig> has been shown to be is involved in hemoglobin endocytosis  <cit> . two isoforms of rab <dig>  were reported by them. the strain used by singh et al.  <cit> : was ur <dig> which is a very long term laboratory cultivated avirulent strain and has been established to be l. tropica  <cit>  whereas our study of rab annotations is based on whole genome sequences of recently cultivated clinical isolates of l. donovani and leptomonas. on blastp analysis of the rab <dig> of both l. donovani and leptomonas with human  showed 45 % and 50 % identity to isoform 5b respectively and rab5b may act as a marker for early endosomes in l. donovani  <cit> . no isoform a in the genome sequence of these two kinetoplastids was present thereby indicating only rab <dig> orthologues.

rab <dig> gtpase and rab <dig> gtpase are actually true rab <dig> and rab <dig> respectively on the basis of bastp analysis of human rab family and these were identified as orthologues in both l. donovani and leptomonas. rab <dig> and rab <dig> are two related subfamilies, which show overlapping localization to late endosomes  <cit> . rab  <dig> was absent in the kinetoplastid genomes. rab <dig> protein has not yet been reported in unicellular eukaryotes, plants and fungi  <cit> . rab <dig> subfamily belongs to the ancestral set of rab and arose before the radiation of eukaryotes. rab7b isoforms are found only in representatives of amphibians, birds and mammals  <cit> . the rab <dig> and rab <dig> identified only in leishmania were branched together which suggests paralogous gene duplications. this is a major force in evolution which provides new gene function. retroposition or lack of introns, as observed in kinetoplastids, is a major contributor for these phenomena. however on blastp analysis with human rab family, these showed identity  <dig> and 37 % to rab  <dig> and rab  <dig> respectively.

rab <dig> was found to be a useful marker to track flagellar pocket division and to follow mitochondrial dna  segregation. leishmania major antibody raised against t. brucei rab <dig> which also cross-reacts with the l. major homologous  <cit> . rab <dig>  appears to regulate endo- lysosomal fusion in dictyostelium  <cit>  primarily found on the contractile vacuole network of membranes, an organelle important in osmotic regulation and, in lesser amounts, in the endo-lysosomal pathway  <cit> .

rabs in intracellular parasites like leishmania are associated with pathogenesis, as vesicle transport is essential for extracellular nutrient acquisition, release of virulence factors, microbicidal resistance and evasion of host immune responses  <cit> , these requirements being different in the monogenetic ancestor leptomonas hence the difference in phylogeny between leishmania and leptomonas for some rabs like rab  <dig> and rab  <dig> 

in our study rab  <dig> and  <dig> in leishmania are paralogues and possibly associated with endosomal recycling. rabs sharing similar functions and/or locations are more closely related than rab proteins with distinct functions  <cit> . rab <dig> and rab <dig>  two examples of tissue-restricted rabs  <cit>  with specialized functions are rightly not detected in our genomes. rabs are involved in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs  <cit> . rab <dig> interacts with p-gp, , a large transmembrane protein localized at the plasma membrane that extrudes anticancer drugs and thus decreases their concentration, and toxicity inside the cells  <cit> . rab <dig> has also been reported to be involved in resistance  <cit> .

flow cytometry experiments showed that sensitivity to doxorubicin was associated with increased drug accumulation in cells expressing the rab6a variant. wth <dig> gene’s product is homologous to the rab <dig> and rab6c genes  <cit> . wth <dig> is a house-keeping gene and its product is capable of binding to gtp molecules. wth <dig>  <cit>  and rab <dig>  <cit>  both are important genes involved in the cellular multi drug resistance  phenotype development. it is a well established fact that the h locus of leishmania codes for a short chain dehydrogenase  gene that is involved in antilfolate resistance  <cit> . we found sdr to be present in rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig> of leishmania but not in the corresponding rab genes of leptomonas. a study in our lab has provided evidence supporting the important role played in drug resistance by the rab <dig> gene of leishmania having sdr at c terminus of gene .

structure activity relationship of l. donovani ggtase-ii with specific inhibitor
since most prenylated proteins in cells are modified by geranylgeranyl moiety rather than farnesyl  <cit>  it offers rab prenylation as a lucrative target for chemotherapeutic intervention in leishmania cell. impairment of rabs  geranylgeranylation by isoprenoid pathway inhibitors  have been demonstrated  <cit> . ne <dig> is a phosphonocarboxylate analogue of the potent bisphosphonate risedronate. ne <dig> inhibited incorporation of  mevalonic acid into rab but not into h-ras or rap <dig>  proteins that are modified by ftase and ggtase i, respectively  <cit> . ne <dig> therefore appears to be the first specific inhibitor of rab prenylation.

the active site architecture of ggtase-ii  of l. donovani was compared with other organisms by alignment. the protein sequences of ggtase-ii  of leishmania donovani were aligned with the ggtase-ii  sequences of homo sapiens , plasmodium falciparum , trypanosoma brucei  and drosophila melanogaster . sequence similarity was seen within the kinetoplastid trypanosoma brucei 65 %, mycobacterium tuberculosis which is also an intracellular parasite like leishmania, however, did not show any presence of ggtase-ii enzyme on data mining. available literature indicated that mycobacterium is predicted to express secreted effectors containing caax motifs that may be prenylated by host protein prenyltransferases  <cit> . while drosophila melanogaster, homo sapiens and plasmodium falciparum were showed  <dig>   <dig> and 29 % sequence similarity to ggtase-ii  of leishmania donovani respectively .fig.  <dig> the active site architecture of ggtase-ii  of l. donovani was compared with other organisms by alignment. multiple sequence alignment of ggtase-ii  of leishmania donovani  with ggtase-ii  of homo sapiens , plasmodium falciparum , trypanosoma brucei  and drosophila melanogaster  showing conserved regions  based on percentage identity



template for ggtase-ii  of leishmania donovani was selected on the basis of sequence similarity and lowest e-value. blastp analysis against pdb database, ggtase-ii  of rattus norvegicus shows 48 % identity and minimum e-value with ggtase-ii  of leishmania donovani and this template was further used for molecular modeling studies.

we have ascertained that the β-subunit of ggtase-ii in both leishmania and leptomonas lie in close proximity done through neighbor-joining method . therefore the β-subunit emerges as the excellent target for compounds inhibiting parasite activity in clinical cases of co-infections. the crystal structure of rab escort protein- <dig> in complex with geranylgeranyltransferase-ii  and isoprenoid from rattus showed 48 % of sequence similarity  with β-subunit of leishmania ggtase-ii thus selected as the template for homology modeling  <cit> . ten models were generated with modeller. the validation of the resulting models was performed using the savs server and the best validated model was selected  <cit> . in the selected model, the majority of the residues  occupy the most favored region of ramachandran plot generated by procheck and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % residues lie in additional allowed region , generously allowed  and disallowed  region respectively . the wiring diagram of β-subunit of ldggtase-ii was performed using the pdbsum server ; a schematic diagram showed the protein’s secondary structure elements  together with various structural motifs such as beta- and gamma-turns, and beta-hairpins. helices are labeled as h <dig>  h <dig>  etc. . the superimposition of the modeled protein  with template 1ltx shows an rmsd of  <dig>  Å . the farnesyl binding site was selected as the active site for docking of the inhibitor. the ne <dig> has a docking score of − <dig>  kcal/mol. the inhibitor is involved in formation of three hydrogen bonds with asn <dig> and one hydrogen bond with trp <dig> as shown by binding mode .fig.  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
by data mining of the prenylation pathway from the genomes of l. donovani and leptomonas, we have tried to analyse the evolutionary and functional similarities between both these kinetoplastids . when compared to rab proteins defined and elucidated in homo sapiens, the presence of rabs in leishmania suggests that leishmania had a sophisticated endo membrane system, which provides its ability to survive in various intracellular and extracellular stages. this detailed analysis of rab proteins has provided information of degree of complexity of exo and endocytic trafficking in this organism. the presence of sdr motif known to be associated with drug resistance in several rab genes of leishmania indicates that as the parasite evolved from monogenetic to digenetic lifestyle it acquired capabilities to evade drug action for its survival in host. the disruption of prenylation pathway of the parasite using highly specific inhibitors will disable the parasite to reside and survive intracellularly within host phagosome microenvironment and prevent it from modulating host defense pathways for its survival.fig.  <dig> data mining of the prenylation pathway from the genomes of l. donovani and leptomonas
