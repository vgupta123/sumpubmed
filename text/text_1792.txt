BACKGROUND
micrornas  are approximately  <dig> nucleotides endogenous non-coding rnas that play important roles in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, resulting in the cleavage or translation repression of target mrnas  <cit> . in plants, mirna-guided gene regulation is involved in multiple developmental processes, such as floral development  <cit> , male and female sterility  <cit> , leaf growth  <cit> , and rna metabolism  <cit> . most plant mirnas have perfect or near-perfect sequences complementary with their target mrna to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . thus, identifying mirnas and their targets, and elucidating their regulatory mechanisms are critical to understand the development processes.

recently, degradome sequencing has been successfully used to analyse the mirna targets. combined with small rna sequencing, the pace of mirna and their targets identification have been greatly improved in plants  <cit> . other studies have also suggested that whole-scale mirna identification and targets analysis might reveal regulatory networks in plant growth and development  <cit> . lately, degradome sequencing has been used to find target genes on arabidopsis, rice, cotton and so on . however, the mirna targets in sacred lotus  have only been predicted by bioinformatics method, and little information has been experimentally validated  <cit> .

sacred lotus is a perennial aquatic plant with ornamental, edible, medicinal value and phylogenetic importance  <cit> . in asia, sacred lotus has been cultivated for more than 7000 years due to its beautiful flowers, edible rhizomes and seeds  <cit> . recently, the genome sequences of the sacred lotus variety ‘china antique’ have been sequenced, which is available for further identifying mirnas in n. nucifera  <cit> .

as an ancient basal eudicots, sacred lotus seed is one of the oldest directly dated seeds for ~1300 year-old. previous studies reported that  <dig> old fruit of ‘china antique’ were collected from the same lakebed and 84 % of them can be germinated in ~3 days  <cit> . the proteins which were heat stable and ros removal were reported to be important for seed longevity . ros adversely affects cellular proteins and enzymes and renders them inactive. some thermal proteins, including superoxidae dismutase  and hsp were demonstrated to reduce deleterious ros accumulation for improving the seed longevity  <cit> . because of the sacred lotus seeds remain viable after hundreds of years, resistance and damage repair in seeds must be extraordinarily effective  <cit> . therefore, sacred lotus seeds could be an excellent model for studying the adaptive mechanisms of seeds  <cit> .

seed germination is the first step for plant growth and plays a pivotal role in seedling establishment. it is a complex physiological and biochemical process and previous studies suggested a role for mirnas in seed germination . using small rna sequencing, the mirna expression patterns in rice embryos at  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h after imbibition showed that osa-mir159f, osa-mir166l and osa-319b were predominantly expressed in rice seeds  <cit> . in soybean, gma-mir <dig> and gma-mir <dig> have been implicated in the conversion between photosynthesis and lipid accumulation by regulating their target genes of transketolase and carboxylase, respcetively  <cit> . in maize,  <dig> know mirnas were identified in the seeds at 24 h after imbibition, and the regulation of the genes targeted by these mirnas was involved in the early stage of seed germination  <cit> . however, little mirnas were known about the seed germination of sacred lotus. therefore, identification of novel mirnas and elucidation of their functions in the seed germination will help us to understand the long living of sacred lotus seed. furthermore, as a basal eudicot, identification of the sacred lotus mirna and comparison with other angiosperms will aid the study of conservation and evolution of mirnas in plants.

to comprehensively investigate small rnas and their targets and provide some information for further understanding the mirna-mediated regulation network in the seed germination of sacred lotus, five small rna libraries and a degradome library were constructed in this study. the profiling of the mirnas and their target genes provides some insights into the regulatory pathways governing gene expression during the seed germination, and the data presented here will lay a foundation for future studies of sacred lotus seed longevity.

RESULTS
overview of small rna library sequencing
to elucidate the regulatory roles of mirnas during the seed germination of sacred lotus, five small rna libraries were constructed from germinating seeds at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 72 h after imbibition and then sequenced by a hiseq <dig>  platform. after filtering the low-quality reads, including reads <18 nt in length, 5′ adaptor contaminates, reads with polya, and reads without 3′adaptors, ranging from  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  to  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  were obtained. more than 60 % of the clean reads were successfully mapped to the sacred lotus reference genome . moreover,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were unique mapped to the genome. other unannotated unique sequences were used for novel mirnas prediction and further analysis .table  <dig> data set summary of sequencing of the five small rna and one degradome libraries



in all of the five libraries, the small rna  sequences were ranged from  <dig> to 28 nt in length, with the majority were  <dig> to 24 nt. and the 24 nt srnas were the most abundant within the total srna, which approximately accounted from 20 % to 35 % in all of the five srna libraries, followed by 21 nt srnas, the typical length of canonical mirnas .

the common and specific of total and unique small rna sequences were compared between the adjacent libraries , showing that more than 75 % of the total srnas were shared . however, only a small fraction  of unique srna shared in adjacent libraries, suggesting that these small rnas were low in abundance but highly in diverse.

identification of mirnas and compared with other plants
conserved mirna families have been identified in many plant species and have important functions in plant development  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> known mirnas  were identified . the unannotated small rna tags were used to predict novel mirnas and their secondary structures of the precursors were further detected by mfold or rnafold to remove the false positive . finally,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in sacred lotus . the largest mirna family size identified was nnu-mir <dig> comprising  <dig> members, following by nnu-mir <dig> and nnu-mir <dig> possessed  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. other mirna families such as nnu-mir <dig>  nnu-mir <dig>  nnu-mir <dig> and nnu-mir <dig> possessed only one member detected in sacred lotus during seed germination of sacred lotus .table  <dig> comparion of the mirna families identified in arabidopsis, rice, amborella and sacred lotus 



a comparison of the identified known mirna families from sacred lotus with other three different plants  showed that the number of mirna families widely varied   <cit> . in sacred lotus, most of the families were represented by from  <dig> to  <dig> variants, except for mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . more than  <dig> variants of mir <dig> family were also detcted in arabidopsis and rice . when comparing  <dig> mirna families of sacred lotus mirnas to those in  <dig> other angiosperm species, five families  were only present in eudicot species. and other two families  were found in basal angiosperm and monocots but not detected in core eudicot species . mir <dig> was identified in basal eudicots  and most of the monocots, but no homologues were found in core eudicots .fig.  <dig> mirna distribution in different plant species. the mirna data were obtained from the mirbase  <dig> and the present study



to validate the predicted novel mirnas, stem-loop rt-pcr was performed for six novel mirnas  with relatively high abundance at all the five stages of seed germination . as a result, all the selected six novel mirnas were found to be expressed in the seed germination .fig.  <dig> potential novel mirnas identified in this study. a the secondary structure of novel_ mir_ <dig> precursor was predicted by mfold. mature mirna is highlighted in red. b stem-loop rt-pcr analysis of the identified novel mirnas. six novel mirnas  were confirmed via stem-loop rt-pcr. the sizes of the obtained pcr products were approximately 60 bp. marker indicates a 50 bp dna ladder marker



differentially expressed mirna at different stages of seed germination
to compare the different mirna expression profiles during the seed germination of sacred lotus, the differential expression analysis of the mirnas was performed between the four stages with 0 h  of germination, based on the normalized read count for each identified mirna . and a total of  <dig> differentially expressed  mirnas were found at the four stages during sacred lotus seed germination. then cluster analysis was conducted to further elucidate the expression patterns of all known mirnas, based on the criteria  . compared with the 0 h of seed germination, many de mirnas were detected in the other four stages . furthermore, eight de mirnas were differentially expressed in all the four rna libraries, while  <dig> de mirnas were expressed in at least two of the four small rna libraries, and  <dig> mirnas were identified only once in the four samples . these results indicated that a larger number of mirnas were differentially expressed during all five stages of seed germination. compared with germinating seed at 0 h, a total of  <dig> de mirnas were up-regulated, while  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated . for instance, nnu-mir156c-5p and nnu-mir159a were significantly expressed at 36 h . nnu-mir165a-5p, nnu-mir166c, nnu-mir166d and nnu-mir2111b showed the highest expression levels at 24 h, while nnu-mir396b-3p showed maximum expression level at 0 h . most of the novel mirnas showed low expression levels and some of them were only found at one stage during the seed germination. however, novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> were highly expressed during all the five stages  and stem-loop rt-pcr also confirmed the expression of novel_mir_ <dig> during sacred lotus seed germination .fig.  <dig> small rnas and their expression patterns at each of the five stages during the seed germination of sacred lotus. a heatmap for the clustering analysis of differentially expressed known mirnas. the bar represents the scale of the expression levels of the mirnas. b venn diagram of the common and specific known mirnas at four different stages  compared with 0 h

degradome sequencing analysis
in this study, a degradome library was constructed from the germinating seed of sacred lotus, followed by degradome sequencing. after discarding the low quality sequences, a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads with  <dig> , <dig> unique clean reads was remained. and  <dig>  %  of the total sequences, corresponding to representing  <dig>  %  of the unique sequences, were mapped to the reference genome to identify the fragments of degraded mrnas.

cleavage of target mrnas of the mirnas were identified by degradome sequencing . generally, the target genes of kown mirnas were mostly transcription factors  <cit> , and similar results were also obtained for the novel mirnas . for example, both nnu-mir159b and nnu-mir319c targeted mrna encoding the myb transcription factor. furthermore, nnu-mir156a, nnu-mir160a, nnu-mir160a-5p and nnu-mir169a targeted mrna encoding squamosa promoter-binding-like protein  <dig>  auxin response factor  <dig>  nac transcription factor and nuclear transcription factor y subunit a- <dig>  respectively . the targets of novel mirnas were also identified by degradome sequencing and many of them were transcription factors, including gamyb , myb , nac  and tcp  .fig.  <dig> target plots  of six identified known mirna targets using degradome sequencing. the red lines indicate signatures consistent with mirna-directed cleavage. a nnu-mir156a slicing nnu_02903-ra at nt  <dig>  b nnu-mir159b slicing nnu_10896-ra at nt  <dig> . c nnu-mir160a slicing nnu_12564-ra at nt  <dig> . d nnu-mir169a slicing nnu_09768-ra at nt  <dig> . e nnu-mir319c slicing nnu_00026-ra at nt  <dig>  f nnu-mir393a-5p slicing nnu_01291-ra at nt  <dig> .

functional annotation of the target genes
to further perceive the putative function of the predicted target genes, gene ontology  analysis was performed. and twenty-five different biological processes, fifteen different cellular components and ten different molecular functions were predicted . the most significantly enriched go terms were involved in the three main categories, “protein phosphorylation”, “nucleus”, and “atp binding”, followed by “regulation of transcription”, “membrane” and “dna binding” . these results suggested that regulation of transcription played a vital role in the process of the seed germination of sacred lotus. moreover, all the targets could be used for kog classifications which were classified into  <dig> groups . the most dominative group was the “general function prediction only”, followed by the “transcription” .fig.  <dig> go analysis and kegg pathways of the target genes. a go analysis of the target genes for differentially expressed mirnas. the colouring of the p-values indicates the significance of the rich factor. the circle indicates the target genes that are involved, and the size is proportional to the gene numbers. the y-axis represents the name of enrichment go terms. the x-axis represents rich factor. the "rich factor" was calculated by the number of genes mapped to the go term divided by the number of all genes in the input list. b kegg pathways of the target genes for differentially expressed mirnas



in addition, kegg analysis was further conducted to elucidate the biological pathways of the de mirna target genes, which were classified into five groups including “organismal system”, “metabolism”, “genetic information processing”, “environment information processes” and “cellular processes” . the categories of “carbohydrate metabolism”, “amino acid metabolism”, “energy metabolism” and “biosynthesis of other secondary metabolism” were the most enriched pathways, which were all in the group of “metabolism”, suggesting that the mirna regulating the expression of metabolic genes played crucial roles in the seed germination.

quantitative rt-pcr validation of mirnas and their target genes
in this study, real time quantitative rt-pcr  was performed to confirm the expression levels of nine significantly de mirnas and three respective predicted target genes, obtained from the high-throughput sequencing . three mirnas  showed the similar expression pattern in terms of read abundance during the five stages of seed germination . for instance, nnu-mir156a showed the highest expression levels at 0 h, and then gradually declined from 12 h to 72 h . moreover, the expression levels of nnu-mir393a-5p, nnu-mir394a, nnu-mir396b-5p, nnu-mir <dig> and nnu-mir2111a were up-regulated and maximized at 24 h and then dramatically decreased to relatively low levels at 36 h and 72 h . some of the mirnas showed the minor discrepancies between sequencing data and the qpcr results, which partially due to the differences in the sensitivity, specificity and algorithm between the two techniques.fig.  <dig> validation of differentially expressed mirnas and some of their targets during the seed germination in sacred lotus by qrt-pcr a nnu-mir157a, b nnu-mir168a-5p, c nnu-mir393a-5p, d nnu-mir396b-5p, e nnu-mir <dig>  f nnu-mir2111a,  g nnu-mir156a, h nnu-mir319c, i nnu-mir394a,  j target of nnu-mir156a , k target of nnu-mir319c , l target of nnu-mir394a 



the expression levels of some of the predicted target genes  were selected for validation using qrt-pcr, and multiple of target genes showed contrasting expression patterns with their corresponding mirnas . for example, tcp <dig>  was the predicted target gene of nnu-mir319c which expression level was sharply declined to the lowest level at 24 h, then gradually increased and remained at a relatively high level at 72 h. on the contrary, the target  of the nnu-mir319c was increased at the 24 h and then gradually declined at 72 h . moreover, nnu-mir156a also showed a negative relationship with its target spl <dig> . the results suggested that some mirnas might be invovled in the regulation of seed germination of sacred lotus  <cit> . however, the expression of fbx showed partially negative relationship with nnu-mir394a and both of them showed high expression levels at 24 h . thus, it is likely that the inverse relationship between mirnas and their targets might be limited during specific stages of germination, because mirnas are not the only regulatory factors affecting their targets  <cit> . since mirnas have been shown to also act by translation inhibition in plants, the fact that the rna expression level of a target is not negatively correlated with mirna expression level does not mean that the target is not real.

putative microrna editing in sacred lotus
the mirna editing patterns showed a significant discrepancy among the germinating seeds at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 72 h . for example, the most dominant nucleotide substitution type were at 12 h and 24 h with t to c ; while the most common nucleotide substitutions were at 0 h and 36 h with a to g and c to t . at the nucleotide positions of  <dig> and  <dig>  the mirna editing events showed the specifically lowest number  . these results were consistent with previous reported mirna editing in rice grain filling  <cit> .fig.  <dig> analysis of mirna editing events. a summary of the nucleotide substitutions positions among mirnas. b summary of the nucleotide substitution types among mirnas. c validation of the editing sites in mirnas obtained from deep sequencing by sanger sequencing. the edited sites are highlighted with black frames. the upper is sequences of genomic dna , and the lower is sequences of cdna



to validate the occurrence of mirna editing events in sacred lotus, two editing types  were examined in nnu-mir160a and nnu-mir319c, respectively . using pcr amplification, precursor mirna sequences from genomic dna and mature mirna sequences from cdna were cloned and sequenced, respectively. comparison analysis of the sequences further confirmed that the mirna editing events really existed in sacred lotus .

discussion
as non-coding rnas, mirnas play key roles in plant growth and development. many studies of mirnas have been reported in model plants such as rice, arabidopsis and maize and so on. sacred lotus is a basal eudicot with ornamental, agricultural, medicinal importance. previous studies on mirnas in sacred lotus were only in leaves or flowers and for bioinformatics searching without experimentally validation  <cit> . phased small interfering rnas  which regulated by mirnas were also identified in chinese scared lotus by bioinformatics analysis  <cit> . however, the number of mirnas identified in sacred lotus is very few and little is known about the mirnas involved in the seed germination of n. nucifera. in this study,  <dig> known mirnas  and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in sacred lotus via deep sequencing and the results were validated by experimental approaches.

most of the sacred lotus mirnas identified in the study were present in monocots and at least one of the core eudicot species, indicating their existence in the ancestor of the two large angiosperm clades. eleven mirna families were conserved among monocots, basal angiosperm, basal eudicots and core eudicots, suggesting that these mirnas were involved in important gene regulation pathways in plants . however, some mirnas might become lost or evolve within some angiosperm lingeages  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> were found in arbidopsis and two basal eudicot species, but not reported in monocots, while mir <dig> was present in monocots but not found in the core eudicot species . that may be because the last common ancestor of monocots and eudicots likely had mir <dig>  with the gene appearing near the speciation of that last common ancestor, but the gene was lot in the ancestor of core eudicots  <cit> . in addition, most of the target mrnas of mir <dig> and mir <dig> as well as mir <dig> and mir <dig> were the same, respectively  <cit> . the loss of mir <dig> or mir <dig> in monocot or core eudicot species indicated the distinct evolution of these species. moreover, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were only present in monocots and n. nucifera, suggesting that they might be ancient mirnas in angiosperm. further investigation of these mirnas and their targets would give some insights into the functional divergence and evolution in angiosperm.

using small rna sequencing, many novel mirnas with low abundance are discovered from various developmental stages. in this study,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified and some of them were validated in the sacred lotus during seed germination . the expression profiles of these novel potential mirnas during the different stages might provide valuable information for seed germination and seed longevity in sacred lotus. in addition, a large number of mirna editing events were found in the seed germination of sacred lotus. analysis of the nucleotide positions of editing sites showed that the  <dig> and  <dig> sites had less editing frequency and positions of  <dig> and  <dig> sites had more editing frequency . the results were in accordance with rice grains, while in rice young panicles, the two sites had more editing events  <cit> . these results indicated that mirna editing was diversity in different tissues and species.

the computational analysis using the cleaveland pipeline revealed a total of  <dig> targets for these known and novel mirnas by degradome sequencing in the present study. our results showed that most mirna families had multiple target genes, while several mirnas from different mirna families shared some target genes. go analysis showed that these targets mainly involved in “protein phosphorylation” and “regulation of transcription” . for kegg pathway, “carbohydrate metabolism” was enriched in the germinating seeds of sacred lotus , indicating that many carbohydrate metabolism related genes were regulated by mirnas during the seed germination in sacred lotus.

in many plant species, plant hormones including gibberellins  and aba, can promote and inhibit seed germination. and some studies also indicated that cross talk between auxin and ga or ethylene might affect seed germination  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, overexpression of mir <dig>  resulted in reduced aba sensitivity during germination. transcriptome analysis of germinating arf <dig> and the transgenic plants expressing arf <dig> with silent mutations  revealed that many aba-responsive genes were overexpressed in germinating marf <dig> seeds  <cit> . furthermore, mir <dig> has been shown to regulate the expression of arf <dig> which is another auxin response transcription factor  <cit> . in this study, the nnu-mir <dig> also targeted the arf <dig>  and the expression of the three mirnas of the mir <dig> families was up-regulated at 24 h during the seed germination . these results indicated that overexpression of mir <dig> might promote seed germinating by decreasing the aba levels in the seed germination of sacred lotus. auxin signal pathways are also regulated by mir <dig> which targets the auxin receptor tir <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . two tir <dig> gene homologues  were also detected for the targets of nnu-mir <dig> in our degradome dataset . the expression level of nnu-mir393a-5p was also validated by qrt-pcr . the down-regulation of some components in auxin signal transduction by mirnas might be a regulatory step to decrease aba sensitivity in mature seeds and to switch to the germination mode  <cit> . mir <dig> has been reported to target gamyb transcription factors which interact with ga-response elements  <cit> . in arabidopsis seeds, mir <dig> regulates the abundance of myb <dig> and myb <dig> mrnas during germination in response to aba. these two myb transcription factors were positive regulators of aba responses and overexpressed mir <dig> would render plants hyposensitive to aba  <cit> . in addition, the two target genes of nnu-mir <dig> also participate in aleurone vacuolation which was in ga-induced pathways during seed germination. in this study, nnu-mir <dig> targeted three gamyb genes and their expression were highly up-regulated at 36 h during seed germination .

the nnu-mir <dig> family members targeted  <dig> squamosa promoter binding proteins like  plant specific transcription factors in the present study . the expression levels of nnu-mir156a and its target gene spl <dig>  were also validated . in plants, spls were reported to be involved in diverse developmental processes including leaf development, phase change and flowering in plants  <cit> . overexpression of mir <dig> in arabidopsis and rice suppressed the expression of spl genes and reduced apical dominance, delayed flowering time and affected the juvenile to adult transition . mir <dig> was also reported to be involved in seed germination in soybean and lotus japonicas  <cit> . however, unlike the maize  <cit> , the expression level of mir <dig> in sacred lotus was down-regulated after 72 h of the seed germination . that may be a factor for the long living of sacred lotus seed and viable for nearly thousands years.

nuclear factor y  was documented to affect the seed development and was targeted by mir <dig> in many plants. in the degradome dataset in the present study, nfya <dig> , nfya <dig>  and nfya <dig>  were the target genes of mir <dig> in sacred lotus . in arabidopsis, overexpression of the target of mir <dig>  resulted in aba hypersensitivity during seed germination  <cit> . thus, up-regulation of most of the mir <dig> genes in sacred lotus might reduce the aba responsiveness during seed germination .

in plants, seed germination is promoted by appropriate environmental conditions including light, temperature, and nutrient availability  <cit> . reactive oxygen species  are largetly generated during the seed germination and reducing the ros and minimizing cell damage might affect the seed germination. mir <dig> which targets l-ascorbate oxidase  might scavenge the oxidative species produced during stress. in the present study, all the mirnas of nnu-mir <dig> family were significant differentially expressed, indicating their roles in seed germination . ppr proteins that regulate gene expression in mitochondria and chloroplasts were also regulated by some mirnas, including nnu-mir <dig>  nun-mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig>  these mirnas might affect the pathways of photosynthesis and lipid accumulation during the seed germination  <cit> .

taken together, we proposed potential roles for mirnas playing during the early stages of seed germination in the sacred lotus . these mirna mediated the regulation of gene expression in many processes, including morphological changes, developmental process, metabolism and responsive to stress process . these results indicated that diverse and complex mirnas were involved in the seed germination. further functional research and target analyses of the conserved and novel mirnas could provide additional clues to the different regulation of gene expression during seed germination. the results in this study will lay a foundation for further investigating of long living of sacred lotus.fig.  <dig> the potential regulatory network for mirnas in the seed germination of sacred lotus



CONCLUSIONS
in this study, combined with small rna sequencing and degradome sequencing,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas with  <dig> targets were identified during seed germination of sacred lotus. go and kegg pathway analyses showed that many target genes enriched in regulation and metabolism. compared with other angiosperm species, some mirna families were present or absent in monocots and core eudicots, indicating the functional divergence and evolution in angiosperm. these results suggested that many mirnas were involved in the regulation of seed germination of sacred lotus and provided insights into the evolutionary gains and losses of mirnas in plants.
