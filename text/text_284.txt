BACKGROUND
sleep disordered breathing and, more specifically, obstructive sleep apnea  have been linked to a variety of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke . atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and its prevalence has been linked to osa in many epidemiologic and clinical studies  <cit> . the prevalence of osa is increased in af patients, and conversely the prevalence of af is increased in patients with osa ; moreover, the risk of af increases with the presence and severity of intermittent hypoxia during sleep . multiple mechanisms have been suggested for how sleep disordered breathing predisposes to af, including sympathetic hyperactivity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and left atrial stretch with myocardial remodeling .

the pathogenesis of arrhythmias often involves structural changes such as alterations of intercellular junctions and fibrosis. af is initiated by triggers  and is sustained by the underlying presence of an abnormal atrial tissue substrate  <cit>  that is largely determined by the abundance and distribution of intercellular channels contained within atrial gap junctions  <cit> . gap junction channels allow the exchange of ions  between adjacent cells, and are critical for normal electrical conduction in all regions of the heart, and remodeling of gap junction organization and expression of the subunit proteins  is a common feature of human heart diseases associated with arrhythmias  <cit> . atrial myocardium contains two major connexins of similar abundance, namely cx <dig> and cx <dig>  while ventricular myocytes predominately express cx <dig>  <cit> .

animal models that can be exploited to understand the relationships between osa and cardiac arrhythmias are now being developed and analyzed. here, we utilized two mouse model to mimic the components of osa: sleep fragmentation  and intermittent hypoxia  in which chronic intermittent hypoxia  closely mimics oxyhemoglobin desaturation patterns associated with osa  <cit> . these mice show many of the abnormalities observed in patients with osa and have been extremely useful for examining the pathophysiology of several end-organ morbidities . many of the abnormalities in these animals appear to derive from reactive oxygen species generated via excessive activation of nadph oxidase  <dig>  .

therefore, to advance our understanding of the cardiac remodeling in response to osa, we studied the hearts of mice exposed to chronic sf or ih, and compared them to control mice exposed to normoxic environments. we examined the levels and distributions of the connexins that form atrial and ventricular gap junctions using a strategy similar to that which we have previously used to study the connexin alterations in atrial tissue from people with isolated atrial fibrillation  <cit> .

RESULTS
we initially compared the histologic appearance of atrial and ventricular tissue sections from ih or ra-exposed c57bl/6 j mice. we found no obvious differences in cell size or shape. to assess potential fibrosis, we quantified the abundance of extracellular space by staining with fluorescent wga, which has similar staining properties to masson’s trichrome, used to detect collagen  <cit> . images of atrial or ventricular sections from mice treated with ra or ih showed similar patterns and extents of staining with wga-texas red-x . we found no significant differences in the percentages of tissue area that reacted with wga between control and ih in atria  or ventricle  . therefore, we concluded that the extent of fibrosis was not affected by exposure to ih.

in order to determine any alterations in the levels of connexins in these mice, we prepared homogenates from atria and from ventricles of mice treated with ra or ih, and detected cx <dig> or cx <dig> by immunoblotting . we found that the levels of both connexins were significantly reduced in atria  and ventricles  of ih-exposed mice . atrial cx <dig> levels in ih mice were reduced to 64% of control values, while levels of cx <dig> in either atrium or ventricle of mice treated with ih were reduced to 72% of values from mice exposed to ra.fig.  <dig> connexin levels are reduced in homogenates of atrium  and of ventricle  in samples prepared from wild type c57bl/6 j mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia. homogenates were prepared from atria  or ventricles  of mice exposed to room air  or to intermittent hypoxia . cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  were detected by immunoblotting. gels were loaded with equal amounts of total protein . blots were also reacted with antibodies directed against vinculin . graphs show the amounts  of immunoreactive connexin in control  and ih mice determined by densitometry . representative blots are shown on the right. the abundances of cx <dig> and cx <dig> were significantly less in all ih groups  as compared with corresponding ra controls 




we studied the abundance and distribution of cx <dig> and cx <dig> in the atria of mice treated with ra or ih. multiple frozen sections were cut from each sample, and cx <dig> and cx <dig> were simultaneously detected by double label immunofluorescence. as illustrated by the examples shown in fig. 2a , immunoreactivity corresponding to each of the connexins was abundantly detected in discrete spots  in control atria. as shown in the overlay image, the two connexins co-localized extensively with a few spots containing only cx <dig> and very rare spots containing only cx <dig>  in atrial sections from mice treated with ih, cx <dig> and cx <dig> also were extensively co-localized. we quantified this overlap in multiple samples as we have done previously  <cit> , and found no differences in the mander’s coefficients that quantify the overlap of cx <dig> on cx <dig>  or of cx <dig> on cx <dig> . however, the abundance of staining for either cx <dig> or cx <dig> appeared dramatically reduced in the ih samples. we quantified these changes by assessing the percentage of cellular area corresponding to gap junctions . moreover, the size of immunoreactive particles  was reduced .fig.  <dig> the abundance and sizes of cx40- and cx43-containing gap junctions are reduced in atria of wild type c57bl/6 j mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia. cx <dig> and cx <dig> were localized by double label immunofluorescence in frozen sections of atria from mice treated with ra or ih. a representative photomicrographs show localization of cx <dig> , cx <dig>  and their co-localization . bar, 20 μm. both cx <dig> and cx <dig> are detected in ra and ih samples; levels of each appear decreased in the ih images; but, the extent of their overlap did not differ between ra and ih.  b graph depicts the quantitation of the abundance of cx43- and cx40-containing gap junctions in these samples . the abundances of both cx <dig> and cx <dig> immunofluorescence per cell area were significantly reduced in atria from ih mice . c graph depicts the quantitation of the sizes of cx43- and cx40-containing gap junctions in these samples. the sizes of cx <dig> or cx <dig> immunoreactive particles were significantly reduced in atria from ih mice 




we conducted a similar immunohistological examination of the abundance and distributions of cx <dig> in ventricle . we performed double label immunostaining with antibodies to n-cadherin to allow a comparison with the abundance and distributions of an adhesive component of the intercalated discs. we did not observe changes in the distributions of either cx <dig> or n-cadherin between ventricular sections of ra or ih mice nor in the overlap of the immunostaining for these two molecules. the extent of cx <dig> and of n-cadherin immunostaining  did not differ between ra and ih, nor did the sizes of particles stained with the two antibodies . these findings suggested that in the ventricles , ih did not lead to significant remodeling of gap junctions.fig.  <dig> the abundance and distribution of cx <dig> and of n-cadherin immunoreactive staining are not altered in ventricles of mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia. cx <dig> and n-cadherin were localized by double label immunofluorescence in frozen sections of ventricles from wild type c57bl/6 j mice treated with ra or ih. a representative photomicrographs show localization of cx <dig>  or n-cadherin  and their co-localization . bar, 20 μm. cx <dig> and n-cadherin are detected in both ra and ih samples; levels of each, their distributions, and their overlap do not appear very different between ra and ih. b graph depicts the quantitation of the abundance of cx43- and n-cadherin-immunoreactivity in these ventricular samples. the abundances of cx <dig> and n-cadherin did not differ significantly between ra  and ih treated mice . c graph depicts the quantitation of the sizes of ventricular cx43- and n-cadherin-containing immunoreactive objects in these samples. the sizes of cx <dig> or n-cadherin immunoreactive particles did not differ significantly between ra  and ih treated mice . n =  <dig> for ra, n =  <dig> for ih




many of the pathological changes induced by ih can be attributed to ros generated by nox <dig>  therefore, we also examined the connexin abundance and distributions in nox2-null mice treated with ra or ih. unlike our findings in the wild type c57bl/6 j mice, we found no significant differences in cx <dig> or cx <dig> levels in atrial or ventricular homogenates prepared from atria or ventricles of nox2-null mice treated with ra or ih . moreover, in immunostained sections of atria from nox2-null mice, there were no differences in the distributions of cx <dig> or cx <dig> between animals treated with ra or ih . quantitation of the percentage of cellular areas occupied by gap junctions and of gap junction size showed no differences between ra and ih mice . thus, in the absence of nox <dig> expression, ih did not elicit a reduction or remodeling of cardiac connexins.fig.  <dig> in nox2-null mice, connexin levels in atrium and in ventricle are not affected by exposure to intermittent hypoxia. homogenates were prepared from atria  or ventricles  of nox2-null mice exposed to room air  or exposed to intermittent hypoxia . cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  were detected by immunoblotting. gels were loaded with equal amounts of total protein  and were also blotted with antibodies directed against vinculin . graphs show the amounts  of immunoreactive connexin in control  and ih mice determined by densitometry . representative blots are shown on the right. the abundances of cx <dig> and cx <dig> did not differ significantly between ra  and ih groups . n =  <dig> for atrium; n =  <dig> for ventricle)

discussion
in this study, we have shown that mice exposed to ih exhibit significant alterations of cardiac connexins and gap junctions. it is likely that these alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of arrhythmias induced by chronic ih. the most consistent and significant changes that we observed were in the atria of these animals where the abundance of both cx <dig> and cx <dig> was reduced, as was the total area and individual sizes of gap junctions containing these connexins.

the reductions of cx <dig> and cx <dig> might likely predispose to atrial arrhythmias. iwasaki et al.  <cit>  recently showed in a similar rodent model that ih increased the inducibility and duration of af. our observed reductions of atrial gap junction channels would likely contribute to the substrate for this arrhythmia. it is also likely that ih might also induce similar reductions of atrial gap junctions and predispose to af in humans as well. many investigators have found reductions or remodeling of cx <dig> and/or cx <dig> associated with af . we have observed major reductions in cx <dig> in tissues from patients with lone af  <cit> . as noted above, many studies have linked osa and af . indeed, prior investigators have suggested that osa may explain the etiology of af in many patients previously labeled as “lone” af  <cit> .

in our study, reductions of cardiac cx <dig> or cx <dig> were not observed in nox2-null animals. therefore, it is likely that reactive oxygen species  generated by nox <dig> are responsible for the connexin remodeling. this is an important link between ih/osa and the pathogenesis of af. previous studies of these mice have shown that excessive activation of nox <dig> in response to ih contributes to pathologies of the brain, adipose tissue, and inflammatory system . in both animal models and humans, increased atrial oxidative stress has been implicated in initiating and sustaining af. nox <dig> is the main source of ros in human atrial myocytes  <cit> . moreover, af develops spontaneously in mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a constitutively active rac <dig>  which activates nox <dig>  <cit> . therefore, targeting this nadph oxidase and the related pathways as proposed to address both osa  <cit>  and af  <cit>  might block the atrial connexin remodeling.

we also observed that exposure to ih produced substantial reductions of cx <dig> in ventricle as determined by immunoblotting. however, we did not detect any alterations of cx <dig> abundance or distribution in ventricle by immunofluorescence. because ventricular gap junctions are very large, often containing thousands of connexin channels, a 28% reduction of cx <dig> might be undetectable by immunofluorescence. regardless, we saw no evidence of remodeling or alterations of the localization of cx <dig> as compared to another component of the ventricular intercalated discs , this argues that the cx <dig> reductions might not affect the anisotropy of ventricular conduction. the ih-induced reduction of ventricular cx <dig> was not observed in nox2-null mice. this suggests that ventricular cx <dig> is another one of the many components of this tissue that are pathologically affected by nox <dig> generated ros  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
exposures to intermittent hypoxia  mimicking obstructive sleep apnea are accompanied by significant alterations in atrial connexins mediated, at least in part, by induction of oxidative stress pathways. these connexin changes may underlie the increased propensity for patients with osa to develop atrial arrhythmias.
