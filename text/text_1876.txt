BACKGROUND
it is well established that increased levels of reactive oxygen species  are involved in a number of diseases including diabetes, complications from obesity, atherosclerosis, and cancer  <cit> . a major source of endogenous ros comes from the mitochondria during the process of oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy in the form of atp. in addition, ros are produced by intracellular membrane oxidases following stimulation either with platelet-derived growth factors, tnf-α, or insulin  <cit> . inflammation is also a major source of ros at sites of tissue fibrosis  <cit> . it is thus important for the cell to rapidly neutralize ros before they can damage cellular macromolecules including dna. a major dna lesion generated by excessive ros is 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, which leads to a single or double strand break when left unrepaired  <cit> . persistent breaks can in turn lead to genomic instability. it is widely believed that the accumulation of mutations is a main cause of several aging processes  <cit> . in addition, oxidative stress is known to shorten telomeres  <cit>  a process likely leading to replicative senescence and aging as well  <cit> . thus, an abnormal response to constant increased levels of endogenous intracellular ros would likely affect aging  <cit> .

some specific inherited monogenic diseases appear to modulate multiple aspects of aging. they are referred as segmental progeroid syndromes. a common feature of all progeroid syndromes is genomic instability. one such syndrome is werner syndrome  also known as "progeria of the adult"  <cit> . ws is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and the premature onset of a number of age related diseases  <cit> . the gene responsible for ws  was identified by positional cloning and encodes a protein containing a recq-type helicase consensus domain  <cit> . it was subsequently found that, in addition to a 3'-5' helicase activity, the wrn protein also possesses a 3'-5' exonuclease activity  <cit> . it has been recently proposed that wrn protein may be required for the repair of oxidative dna damage  <cit>  including oxidative dna damage at telomeres  <cit> .

remarkably, increased oxidative stress was described for ws patients  <cit> . furthermore, human ws fibroblasts exhibit increased intracellular oxidized protein content  <cit> . increased oxidative stress was also observed in embryonic cells derived from mice lacking part of the helicase domain  <cit> . in this study, we sought to determine the impact of additional oxidative stress in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking part of the helicase domain of the wrn gene ortholog. expression profiling analyses of wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells revealed a very different response to addition of hydrogen peroxide in culture compared to wild type cells as they already exhibit a modest but significant chronic increase in intracellular ros levels.

RESULTS
oxidative stress in wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts
previous data have indicated that wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts acquire a slower growth rate than wild type fibroblasts with the number of passages in culture  <cit> . in addition, wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells exhibit increased chromosomal rearrangements with the number of passages in culture  <cit> . as oxidative dna damage can lead to chromosomal rearrangements, levels of intracellular ros and the extent of oxidative dna damage were measured in wild type and wrnΔhel/Δhel embryonic fibroblasts. intracellular ros levels were examined directly in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with the dye 2'-7' dichlorofluorescein diacetate. this dye is highly fluorescent upon oxidation. cells in the presence of the dye were lysed and the extent of fluorescence released from cells was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer as described previously  <cit> . as shown in figure 1a, ros levels were 10% higher in wrnΔhel/Δhel cells  compared to wild type cells. concomitantly, there were on average  <dig> abasic sites per pg of genomic dna in wild type cells and  <dig> abasic sites per pg of genomic dna in wrnΔhel/Δhel cells, a 20% increase in the mutant cells  . these results indicate that wrnΔhel/Δhel cells exhibit a modest but significant increase in oxidative stress.

since a cellular redox change may decrease energy production in the form of atp from mitochondria, we next examined intracellular atp levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. as shown in figure 1c, the atp level in wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells was 30% lower than wild type cells. consequently, the adp/atp ratio in wrnΔhel/Δhel cells was approximately 30% higher than wild type cells . a lower atp production might be a consequence of disruption of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential in mutant cells. the mitochondrial membrane potential was thus examined in our mouse embryonic fibroblasts with the fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester  as indicated in figure 1e, fluorescence intensity was 30% lower in wrnΔhel/Δhel cells compared to wild type cells . taken together, these results indicate a disturbance of mitochondrial activities in wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells.

glutathione  is the principal intracellular low-molecular-weight thiol and it plays a critical role in the defense against oxidative stress in mammalian cells. we wanted to know whether the abundance of this molecule is affected in mutant cells. levels of gsh were thus quantified in our mouse wild type and wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant embryonic fibroblasts. remarkably, levels of gsh were 151% higher in wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells compared to wild type cells  . these results suggest that wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells display an adaptive response to oxidative stress. this response was further examined by treating cells with exogenous h2o <dig>  cells were treated one hour with  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> and gsh levels were measured  <dig> hours later. as indicated in figure  <dig>  h2o <dig> induced a 178% increase in gsh levels in wild type cells . there was no significant increase in gsh levels in wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells. as indicated above gsh levels were already high in untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel cells. these results indicate that wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells continuously exhibited an increased anti-oxidant response.

expression profiling of mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with h2o2
little is known about the global response to h2o <dig> in wild type and wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts. to compile a list of h2o2-responsive genes, we compared wild type cells before and after oxidative cellular stress. cells were treated with h2o <dig> for one hour, fed with fresh media, and cytoplasmic rna was harvested  <dig> hours later. hybridization was performed on whole mouse genome agilent 60-mer oligo microarray chips  by mixing wild type cy-3-labeled crna  with h2o2-treated wild type cy-5-labeled crna. hybridization experiments were performed twice with different wild type biological replicates. the same strategy was adopted for wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells. hybridization was performed by mixing untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cy-3-labeled crna with h2o2-treated wrnΔhel/Δhel cy-5-labeled crna.

lists of genes differentially expressed were generated by requiring that the absolute value of the fold change be higher than two, that the log <dig> of the expression level  for each gene be higher than six, and the adjusted p-value, using the benjamini-hochberg method, be lower than  <dig> . six hundred and seventy eight genes exhibited a two-fold alteration in mrna expression level in h2o2-treated wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared to untreated wild type cells  . four hundred and twenty one genes exhibited a two-fold alteration in expression in h2o2-treated wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared to untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel cells  . one hundred and seventy five genes were altered in both h2o2-treated wild type and wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts .

real time rt-pcr was performed on seven randomly picked genes from the untreated versus h2o2-treated wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts data  to confirm our microarray analyses . a list of the primers for the genes analyzed is shown in the additional file  <dig>  overall, the fold changes observed by real time rt-pcr were in good agreement with the predicted fold changes from the microarray data highlighted by a significant spearman's correlation .

the panther classification system was used to classify differentially expressed genes by their functions in specific biological processes. categorization of the genes in our lists revealed  <dig> and  <dig> significantly down regulated biological processes  for wild type and wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with h2o <dig>  respectively . four processes were commonly down regulated in wild type and wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with h2o <dig> and they include genes involved in cation transport, chromatin remodeling, cell motility, and developmental processes  . the only additional biological process that was down regulated in wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts corresponded to the cellular defense response requiring antigen presentation during major histo-compatibility complex ii molecule -mediated immunity. wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with h2o <dig> also exhibited decreases in biological pathways affecting protein and vesicle transportation, cell surface mediated signal transduction, cell cycle and proliferation, nucleic acid metabolism, several types of protein modification and folding, proteolysis, glycolysis, and mitosis . finally, based on panther analysis no biological pathway was significantly up regulated in either h2o2-treated wild type or h2o2-treated wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

several biological processes are already decreased in untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts
we also performed panther analysis on the list of genes differentially expressed between untreated wild type and untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts. differentially expressed genes between wrnΔhel/Δhel and wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts were selected by requiring that the log <dig> of the expression level for each gene be higher than six and the adjusted p-value, using the benjamini-hochberg method, be lower than  <dig>  . figure 4a indicates that biological processes such as protein folding, protein metabolism and modification, proteolysis, g-protein-mediated signaling, cation transport, and developmental processes were significantly down regulated in wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared to wild type cells . purine metabolisms, as well as amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis processes, were up regulated in wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared to wild type cells. these results indicate that all the biological processes down regulated in untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts  were also down regulated in h2o2-treated wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts .

discussion
we have previously observed increased oxidative stress in mouse embryonic fibroblasts established from wrnΔhel/Δhel mice compared to wild type cells  <cit> . in this study, we further explored this phenotype by examining the expression profile of such cells. wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cell lines exhibited a 10% increase in ros levels compared to wild type cells . importantly, the high levels of gsh in wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells confirmed indirectly the increased oxidative stress in such cells. in fact, gsh levels in wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells were almost as high as wild type cells that had been treated with exogenous h2o <dig> . further analysis of cells with the potentiometric dye tmre has indicated a lower mitochondrial transmembrane potential in wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells. at the same time, we detected a lower amount of atp in the mutant cells compared to wild type cells. production of lower quantities of atp by mitochondria may in part be responsible for the slow growth phenotype associated with wrnΔhel/Δhel cells  <cit> . the increase in ros concomitant with the high levels of gsh and the lower energy production  by mitochondria in wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts are consistent with the phenotypes observed in the liver tissue of wrnΔhel/Δhel mice  <cit> . wrnΔhel/Δhel mice exhibit increased gsh levels in liver tissue with increased ros, dna damage and decrease atp levels with age. these results suggest that the observed anomalies in the wrnΔhel/Δhel mice are observable at the cellular level with mouse embryonic fibroblasts in culture. such results suggest that cells in a given tissue already exhibit a modest but chronic intracellular pro-oxidative status. in accord with this, a pro-oxidative status has been described for ws patients  <cit> .

our prediction was that an exogenous addition of ros to wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells would exacerbate the intracellular metabolic anomalies and damage as the anti-oxidative system of such cells is already saturated  while coping with a chronic higher intracellular level of ros. the results obtained with mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with an exogenous source of h2o <dig> are highly relevant since additional ros at the tissue level may follow each meal due to increased sugar and lipid levels in the blood stream after ingestion. increased sugar and lipids will potentially impact on the cellular redox status of cells in several tissues  <cit> .

the impact of h2o <dig> on the expression profile of wrn mutant cells has not been previously analyzed. microarray analyses indicated that wrnΔhel/Δhel mouse embryonic fibroblasts respond very differently from wild type cells to exogenous h2o <dig>  these results are consistent with the observation that human ws cells respond differently to h2o <dig> when compared to cells with a functional wrn gene product  <cit> . again, this difference maybe due to the fact that cells with a mutation in the wrn gene are already exhibiting chronic increased oxidative stress in culture  <cit> . significant decreases in the expression of genes involved in mitosis, glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism , nucleic acid metabolism, cell cycle control, as well as protein modification and stability were observed in h2o2-treated wild type embryonic fibroblasts. such dramatic decreases in these biological processes were not observed in h2o2treated wrnΔhel/Δhel cells. interestingly, untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel cells already exhibited changes in several of these biological processes before the addition of h2o <dig> suggesting again a chronic oxidative stress in these mutant cells. a likely deleterious consequence of responding differently to additional ros is a greater increase in the presence of persistent dna breaks and the rapid accumulation of chromosome rearrangements compared to wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> .

the international registry of werner syndrome http://www.wernersyndrome.org has provided molecular diagnosis of ws for over a decade. fifty distinct mutations inactivating the wrn protein have been described in ws patients to date  <cit> . these mutations include missense and nonsense substitutions, frame shifts and premature translation termination mutations, deletions and insertions. all these mutations are believed to disrupt the normal function of wrn protein or to cause a truncation of the protein that cannot localize to the nucleus, the normal site of wrn protein action. some mutations also cause abnormally rapid degradation of the wrn protein. our mouse model has an in-frame deletion in the helicase domain of the wrn protein, which is as stable as the normal protein  <cit> . however, the mutant protein does not stably interact with the dna replication complex  <cit>  suggesting that this mutation in mouse severely affects the overall function of the mutant wrn protein. although thorough biochemical analyses of this mutant protein are required, the wrn helicase mutant mice provide a compelling model as they exhibit most metabolic abnormalities observed in human ws patients  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, untreated wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant cells exhibit increased ros generation due to alterations in mitochondrial activities. the exact reason for such mitochondrial alterations is unknown but mitochondrial dysfunction is well known to lead to physiological decline with age  <cit> . we recently observed that a transient knock down of wrn protein in human fibroblasts is sufficient to change the expression of genes involved in lipidogenesis  <cit> . such changes are known to affect the redox status in cells, which in turn affects mitochondrial function  <cit> . interestingly, we have also observed that wrnΔhel/Δhel mutant mice exhibit increased rate of point mutations in the mitochondrial dna of liver and heart tissues  <cit> , which can potentially lead to further mitochondrial dysfunction with age. finally, a transient knock down of wrn in human fibroblasts will increase the activity of several protein kinase c enzymes including pkcδ  <cit> . pkcδ is known to modulate ros production from mitochondria  <cit> . hence, there is the interesting possibility that depletion of wrn activates pkcδ, which in turn modulates ros production from mitochondria. indeed, a decreased production of ros in wrn-depleted fibroblasts can be observed by knocking down pkcδ protein levels in such cells. future appropriate experiments will determine which pathways, transcription regulation of specific metabolic genes or activation of specific kinases, are responsible for the redox imbalance seen in human wrn mutant or mouse wrnΔhel/Δhel cells.
