BACKGROUND
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is an x-linked recessive disorder with an incidence of  <dig> in  <dig>  live born males. it is caused by the dysfunction of dystrophin , a large  <dig> kda cytoplasmic protein that forms a link between actin filaments and the dystrophin-glycoprotein  complex  <cit> . the loss of dystrophin is thought to affect the integrity of the cell membrane leading to a disruption in cellular calcium homeostasis and eventually cell necrosis  <cit> . at the genetic level, one-third of boys afflicted with dmd have point mutations, insertions or deletions while the remaining two-thirds have gross deletions or rearrangements within the  <dig>  mb gene  <cit>   and all generally cause a translational frameshift.

therapeutic strategies such as gene replacement have been used to restore protein expression by effectively re-engineering dystrophin cdna. in addition, attempts have been made to introduce smaller functional homologs of dmd to cells in an attempt to reverse the muscle degradation process  <cit> . vectors, which carry these constructs, however, often elicit an immune response  <cit> . an rna/dna chimeric oligonucleotide  has been used successfully to correct the splice site mutation to generate a genetic alteration in the dystrophin gene, in both ex vivo and in vivo studies in mouse and dog models of dmd  <cit> . in a pioneering study, bartlett et al.  <cit>  showed the correction of the canine dystrophin gene within skeletal muscle fibers after injecting the chimera into the cranial tibialis of golden retrievers. the production of wild-type dystrophin was restored and could be detected for up to  <dig> weeks at the site of the injection. rando et al.  <cit>  demonstrated chimera-directed repair of the dystrophin gene in the mouse extending the results from the dog model; once again the corrected cells were again localized to the injection site.

antisense oligonucleotides also have been used to alter the splicing of the dystrophin message in a process generally termed, exon skipping  <cit> . a large number of exciting reports have demonstrated the feasibility of altering the splicing patterns of the mutant dmd transcript  <cit> . while this approach is likely to have significant therapeutic benefit, the original dmd mutation remains and thus a continuum of antisense odn delivery will be required  <cit> .

when muscle fibers are damaged within the body, a population of quiescent precursor muscle cells, or satellite cells, become activated myoblasts  <cit> , rapidly divide and initiate the regeneration of the injured muscle  <cit> . in the case of dmd, the muscle is thought to be constantly going through cycles of degeneration and regeneration due to the instability of the musculature and, therefore, abundantly populated with myogenic precursor cells. thus, an important long term therapeutic approach then would be to isolate and genetically correct the myoblasts at the dna level with subsequent transplantation to the animal model in order to restore functional dystrophin to the muscle fibers.

we have begun to develop a more defined ex vivo strategy in which modified single-stranded oligonucleotides are designed to repair the mutant dystrophin  in cell cultures enriched in myoblasts. a current challenge is to establish a frequency of repair that leads to a level of dystrophin expression that can be detected in targeted myoblasts. previously, bertoni et al.  <cit>  have used fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides to correct a point mutation in cells derived from the dystrophic mdx5cv mice. we now repeat the correction of dmd point mutation using unlabeled modified single stranded oligonucleotides and establish novel quantitative assays to measure the dystrophin production in myoblasts. we also stimulate the correction reaction by using rnai against msh <dig>  a known inhibitor of the gene repair reaction  <cit>  and observe higher levels of gene repair.

RESULTS
isolation of primary cultures from dystrophic mdx5cv mice containing myoblasts with determination of isolation efficiency
in the natural muscle environment, satellite cells rest in a quiescent state along the periphery of an intact muscle fiber. when muscle fibers are damaged, muscle precursor cells, referred to as myoblasts, divide and fuse with the damaged muscle fibers to repair them . in order to isolate the muscle precursor cells for gene repair experiments, muscle tissue was removed from the limbs of  <dig> to  <dig> days old mdx5cv mice, enzymatically digested and plated. a pre-plating technique was used to purify these cells from fibroblasts present in the explant  <cit> . it is known that the fibroblasts adhere to the plate rapidly, usually within  <dig> hours, and, therefore, the pre-plating technique is used them from the culture by passaging the supernatant at a  <dig> hour time point  and again at a  <dig> hour time point   <cit> . thus, the supernatant is passaged until pp <dig> at which time cells are harvested to determine the efficiency of myoblast isolation by incubation with an antibody against desmin . we estimate the efficiency of myoblast isolation in this experiment to be 53% as determined by counting the number of desmin positive cells and dividing this number by the number of total cells observed in multiple fields of view . the remaining 47% are most likely fibroblasts. thus, in the experiments outlined below, we utilize cultures that contain approximately 50% myoblasts and 50% fibroblasts. primarily myoblasts are a target because only corrected myoblasts that fuse to form myotubes will be capable of expressing corrected dystrophin.

in order to determine the efficiency of gene repair of the chromosomal dystrophin gene in myoblasts, it was important to determine the level of transfection of oligonucleotides. oligonucleotides in varying amounts were complexed with fugene  <dig> to observe the levels of uptake within the myoblasts. fugene mediated transfection only showed a 4–6% uptake of the fam-labeled oligonucleotides . therefore, we chose to use jetpei, which is formulated specifically for delivery of oligonucleotides to deliver the odn into the primary cultures. myoblast cultures were seeded at increasing densities and lipoplexes composed of  <dig> μl of jetpei and  <dig> μg of odn were added to cultures with readout of uptake by facs analysis after  <dig> hours. there was no difference in the amount of oligonucleotide uptake at different cell numbers as shown in figure  <dig> . facs was used to quantify uptake of fam-labeled oligonucleotide as well as cell death by propidium iodide. thus, a range of cell densities can be transfected using the jetpei complex.

gene repair of dystrophin directed by modified single-stranded oligonucleotides in purified myoblasts from mdx5cv mice
the mdx5cv mouse has a point mutation in exon  <dig>  which creates a splice donor site that results in a  <dig> base deletion within the exon . this deletion results in a reading frameshift wherein a premature stop codon is created  <dig> bases downstream of the mutation site. if the odn directs correction of the base, then the correct splice pattern is recreated and the  <dig> deleted bases remain in the message; in effect, restoring the reading frame. to evaluate the restoration of the  <dig> base pair insertion, a reverse primer was designed to bind to the deleted portion of exon  <dig>  thus, amplification can only occur if the targeted splice site corrected and the full-length mature message is produced at detectable levels. to determine the level of expression of dystrophin mrna where the deleted region had been restored, mrna was reverse-transcribed using a primer specific for exon  <dig>  which is present in all of the transcripts, corrected or not.

we outlined oligonucleotide-mediated gene repair reactions containing odns, mdx47nt or mdx47t, designed to correct the t substitution mutation within exon  <dig> of the dystrophin gene. these are depicted in figure  <dig>  for clarity, we provide the wild type and mutant dna sequence, as well. the "t" indicates that the 47-mer is designed to target the transcribed strand while the "nt" refers to a molecule designed to target the non-transcribed strand.

the oligos were delivered to myoblasts by jetpei and the cells were allowed to recover for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours respectively at which point genomic dna was extracted. twenty-five nanograms of dna were subjected to absolute quantification using the taqman probe analysis. this assay measures the amount of wild-type or corrected dystrophin dna within each sample. the probe is designed to recognize only dystrophin sequences that contain the changed base and, thus, no direct sequencing of the gene is necessary to confirm sequence alteration  <cit> . figure 3a shows that wild-type dystrophin can be detected by  <dig> hours after transfection with either mdx47nt or mdx47t. the highest amount,  <dig> pg, a significant  <dig>  fold increase , is detected when cells are targeted with mdx47nt. mdx47t corrects less efficiently with an overall average of  <dig> pg of wild-type dystrophin detected from  <dig> to  <dig> hours, indicating that there is a strand bias toward the nontranscribed strand of the dystrophin gene . pcr products directly from the probe assay were sequenced to confirm the correction within genomic dna and the sequencing results show that the corrected base  is the major product in the reaction with a very minor peak  being the uncorrected mutant base. this minor mutant peak correlates to the specificity of the probe reaction in that a low level of the mutant base is detected, but as shown in figure 3a, this background is not statistically significant in the quantitation assay.

to evaluate gene repair at the rna level, quantitative rt-pcr was carried out using a primer set specific for exon  <dig> and the deleted portion of exon  <dig>  table  <dig> illustrates the cycle number at which the restored portion of the exon initially appears. in these analyses, higher ct values are equivalent to a lower amount of corrected message while a lower in ct values signifies an increase in the presence of the deleted portion of exon  <dig>  table  <dig> shows that the deleted region is detected at  <dig> hours of targeting followed by  <dig> hours in dm. a statistically significant 6-fold increase in message is detected above nonspecific levels. taken together, the data indicate that the 47nt is capable of correcting the dystrophin gene and restoring dystrophin expression to the targeted population. interestingly, the fold increase in correction detected of the dystrophin gene detected with the taqman probe   is not equivalent to the fold increase in expression . a likely explanation for this observation indicates that some correction is occurring in fibroblasts, which do not express dystrophin, although such a comparison may not be possible.

a quantitative measurement of dystrophin transcripts containing the deleted portion of exon  <dig> was also performed. the cells were induced to differentiate with addition of media containing 2% horse serum at the indicated time points for  <dig> hours. each sample was subjected to rt pcr using either dystrophin specific primers or oligo dt primers. qpcr was performed using a reverse primer specific for the deleted portion of exon  <dig>  gapdh was used as a loading control and ckm levels were measured to ensure similarities in the extent of differentiation between samples. significance was measured by a student's t-test and samples were considered significantly different with a p value of less than * <dig> , ** <dig> , *** <dig> . mdx47nt was used to correct the mutation while nonspecific odn was used as a negative control. gapdh and ckm were used as positive controls with the odns in parenthesis added to the mrna mixtures.

the donor splice site in the dmd gene in mdx5cv mice causes a frameshift which results in a translation of truncated dystrophin protein . as shown above, correction of the mutation at the dna level resulted in the restoration of intact dystrophin message. to determine whether the corrected mrna is translated into normal dystrophin that contains exon  <dig>  cells were seeded and once again transfected with mdx47nt or mdx47t under conditions that provided the highest level of gene correction. the entire assay was performed in microscope chambers so that the samples could be probed directly with an antibody specific for the dystrophin protein. figure  <dig> reveals the presence of dystrophin after a  <dig> hour recovery and  <dig> hour differentiation period, indicating dystrophin is now being produced within myotubes. within myotubes that stain positive for dystrophin, it is evident that the protein is distributed throughout  these data are in agreement with the western blot analyses performed previously by bertoni et al.  <cit> . altogether, the data from dna, mrna and protein analyses show that single stranded oligonucleotides without conjugated chemical moieties at their termini  correct the dystrophin gene in cultures containing an enriched population of myoblasts isolated from dystrophic mice.

enhancement of dystrophin correction by knockdown of msh2
we and others have shown that a transient knockdown of the mismatch repair protein msh <dig> in repair proficient cells can increase the overall level of gene repair  <cit> . msh <dig> is thought to inhibit the repair reaction through its action as an anti-recombinase  <cit>  by precluding the binding of the oligonucleotide. therefore, by knocking down the levels of this protein, we might predict that the oligonucleotide will bind more stably to the target site with higher efficiency and facilitate oligonucleotide binding. in order to determine whether the repair reaction could be stimulated by knocking down msh <dig> in primary cells, we treated our cultures enriched in myoblasts with increasing concentrations of rnai and quantified the amount of wild-type dystrophin dna appearing after incubation with the targeting oligonucleotide for  <dig> hours. the correction frequency was enhanced  <dig> and  <dig> fold at the  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm concentrations of the rnai . the efficiency decreases at higher concentrations of rnai presumably due to the elevated levels of rnai toxicity often observed in treated cells  <cit> . the enriched cell cultures used above were purified further to obtain myoblasts. this was accomplished by plating the cells on a collagen coated dish in f <dig> media. once confluency was reached, the myoblasts were detached and separated from fibroblasts ; this procedure was carried our repeatedly until the population of cells in the pooled culture was predominantly purified myoblast. the steps in this procedure are illustrated in figure  <dig>  panels i and ii display the enriched culture of cells  and after differentiation into myotubes ; the arrows point to fibroblasts. in panels  and , the purified myoblast culture is illustrated before  and after  differentiation into myotubes. panels  and  display cells in dark field after staining with desmin . the fact that the vast majority of cells are stained in panel  indicated that differentiation into myotubes has occurred. thus, the procedure has enabled the isolation of a purified culture of myoblasts that can be targeted with the oligonucleotide.

the mdx47nt odn was introduced using jetpei into a purified myoblast culture at various doses  and incubated for  <dig> hours. genomic dna was isolated and rt-pcr performed to analyze the samples for gene repair. we observed a clear dose response by calculating the amount of wild-type dna emerging in treated samples  as compared to a standard curve . the data suggest that a wild type dystrophin allele is present in at least some of the myoblasts where gene repair should have taken place. while it is not a perfectly sound comparison, the levels of gene repair in the enriched cultures and the purified cultures are approximately equivalent at the  <dig> hour time point . interestingly, the background level from the untreated control samples is higher in the purified myoblasts than in the enriched culture.

since rnai-directed msh <dig> knockdowns had elevated correction efficiencies in myoblast-enriched cultures, we applied this strategy to cultures of purified myoblasts where active conversion was shown  to take place. purified myoblast cultures were treated simultaneously with various doses of the rnai used in the experiments presented in figure  <dig> and either  <dig>  μg,  <dig>  μg or  <dig>  μg of targeting odn, mdx47nt. the fold change in the evolution of wild type dystrophin dna was measured after  <dig> hours and the results are presented in figure 8a, b and 8c, respectively. no statistically significant difference in correction activity is observed at any rnai level, although a clear reduction in msh <dig> rna levels is taking place . these data differ from the results reported in figure  <dig> suggesting perhaps that enhancement of gene repair by rnai may not have been occurring in myoblasts.

discussion
successful correction of the dystrophin gene using either the rna/dna chimera or the modified single stranded oligonucleotide has been achieved in both dogs and mice by direct injection of synthetic dna molecules  <cit> . the frequency of correction throughout muscle tissues however must be increased to enable therapeutic benefit. bertoni et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that when muscle is injected directly with synthetic oligonucleotides, genetic correction was restricted to the dystrophin gene within a population of satellite cells. since the frequency of gene repair is higher when delivery to cells outside the body takes place in an ex vivo approach. thus, a more efficient approach for the treatment of dmd might entail using ex vivo delivery with subsequent transplantation back into the host.

to enable this ex vivo strategy, it was essential to optimize the efficiency of odn delivery and odn-mediated correction of myoblasts. this was accomplished by transfecting a culture of primary muscle cells enriched in myoblasts with a fam labeled oligonucleotide and measuring uptake by facs analysis. we confirmed that the odn was present in the nucleus by examining the nuclei with confocal imaging . correction of the point mutation in the dystrophin gene was then demonstrated at the level of dna, rna and protein. analysis of the quantity of corrected dna indicated that the correction frequency remains stable over the course of  <dig> hours when targeting with either mdx47nt or mdx47t. a significant increase in message containing the portion of exon  <dig> deleted in the mutant cells was also detected at both  <dig> and  <dig> hours after transfection. there was no reduction in the level of repaired rna over time which suggests that the corrected gene produces stable and inheritable message.

dna analyses indicate that correction occurs at a  <dig> fold higher frequency when the nontranscribed strand of the gene is targeted. one hypothesis for strand bias is that the movement of rna polymerase would interrupt the pairing of the odn and this would result in lowered correction efficiency  <cit> . the dystrophin gene, however, is expressed only in differentiated cells and therefore, odn binding stability should not be disrupted by the movement of the rna polymerase. alternatively, the orientation of the gene in terms of the general direction of replication fork movement can influence the targeting frequency in that the lagging strand targets at a higher level than the leading strand  <cit> . thus, the strand designated as nontranscribed may also be the lagging strand at the target site.

previous experiments of ferrara and kmiec  <cit>  show that the corrected cells reduce their cell division cycle after introduction of the oligonucleotide because the free dna ends activate g <dig> checkpoint proteins. during this time, the uncorrected population is able to divide, which will, in effect, cause the number of corrected cells to be diluted in number. this results in a lower measure of correction efficiencies as division in the uncorrected population is not impaired. in primary myoblasts cultures, however, this does not seem to be the case as the whole population of cells continues to divide with the correction efficiency maintained. this observation suggests that the corrected cells do not suffer a growth disadvantage by this ex vivo protocol.

duchenne muscular dystrophy  is caused by an absence of the protein dystrophin as indicated by the absence of immunostaining for this protein in most of the muscle fibers. we observed elevated levels of dystrophin in cells that were treated with specific odns designed to correct the mutated dystrophin gene and after introduction of the oligonucleotide, myotubes that are expressing a significant amount of dystrophin are detected at  <dig> hours. the number of corrected cells that contribute dystrophin to the positive myotubes is unknown, but it is interesting to note that each myotube that stained positive had dystrophin evenly distributed throughout. this indicates that the dystrophin produced by the corrected gene can diffuse throughout a small myotube in vitro and would probably diffuse though part of a myofiber in vivo, in a region called the nuclear domain  <cit> . the long-term goal of the present study is to transplant corrected myoblasts back into mice to restore dystrophin production in muscle fibers. to achieve this goal it was necessary to establish ex vivo targeting conditions wherein the highest level of correction frequency in purified cells is achieved. the observation that msh <dig> knockdown enhanced the repair frequency also indicates that the mechanism of gene repair is conserved in primary cells and has, to some degree validated basic studies in established model systems  <cit> . to our surprise, rnai knockdown of msh <dig> in cultures of purified myoblasts did not lead to an elevation in the repair of the mutant dystrophin gene, regardless of increasing amounts of correcting odn at the varying doses of rnai. the overall level of correction in the purified cultures is substantially lower and may be at a basal level where adjuvant treatments designed to stimulate activity do not impact the gene repair reaction. in addition, these results suggest that the stimulation of correction in the enriched cultures was likely taking place in the fibroblasts which contaminate the culture. for unknown reasons, primitive progenitor cells are less amenable to gene repair or at least provide an environment, less conducive for the reaction.

correction levels vary among cell types with certain mutant targets being repair at levels approaching 1–5%. yet, the consensus view is that progenitor cells, at any step along the differentiation pathway, do not enable this reaction to take place efficiently  <cit> . a series of natural barriers seems to exist in these cell types including lower transfection efficiencies and dosage-dependent toxicity. increasing the amount of odn introduced into the cell usually results in a gradual increase in side effects  <cit> . progenitor cells are usually more sensitive to the transfection agent  <cit>  and strand bias for targeting can also vary widely based in gene types  <cit> . murphy et al.  <cit>  found a mismatch hierarchy that contributed to the various levels of gene correction; a:g > a:a > a:c. if this is true, then the capacity to target progenitor cells will be hampered. such a hierarchy has not been observed in somatic cell targeting where correction efficiencies are generally higher.

CONCLUSIONS
thus, progenitor cells will present unique challenges that will require exogenous manipulation to elevate frequency of gene repair. while msh <dig> knockdown appears not to be a sufficient protocol to meet this goal in myoblasts, it does not mean that other progenitor lineages will not response positively. in fact, dekker et al.  <cit>  have already shown that msh <dig> knockdown does increase the frequency of gene repair in mouse es cells. more recently, aarts et al.  <cit>  provided support and confirmed these observation and maguire and kmiec  <cit>  extended this protocol successfully into mouse embryonic fibroblasts. morozov and wowrousek  <cit>  followed among the same theme with observations that inhibition of rad51/ <dig> and ku70/ <dig> led to an increase in gene correction efficiency. these types of cellular manipulations are certainly feasible and may be required for the successful application of gene repair in primary or progenitor cells.
