BACKGROUND
classical restriction and modification  systems provide the host bacteria with protection against infection by foreign dna and protect the cellular dna from restriction by methylation of adenosyl or cytosyl residues within the sequence recognised by the restriction enzymes. these enzymes are divided into three groups; type i, ii and iii, of which the type i r-m systems are the most complex discovered so far.

genomic sequencing still detects new putative r-m systems, and comparative genomics reveals that r-m systems are spread widely in bacteria and archea  <cit> . r-m systems are also encoded by algal viruses as well as bacteriophages  <cit> . almost  <dig> r-m systems have been characterized to date and more than  <dig> have been predicted from bioinformatic analyses of dna sequences  <cit> . based on functional complementation, antibody cross-reactivity, sequence similarity and specific distance between methylated adenines, type i r-m systems are divided into four families   <cit> . kpnbi r-m system was detected as the prototype of a new family ie  <cit> . in these most complex r-m systems, restriction and modification activities are catalysed by one enzyme composed of three different subunits, which are encoded by the hsdr, hsdm and hsds genes. except for plasmid-borne r-m systems, most of the hsd genes are chromosomally located alleles, especially in enteric bacteria in a locus at  <dig>  min termed the immigration control region . icr was first defined in escherichia coli k- <dig> and includes, within  <dig> kb of dna, the hsdr, hsdm and hsds genes encoding the ecoki type i system, as well as the methylation-dependent restriction system genes, mcrb, mcrc and mrr  <cit> . type i restriction genes resident here  are known to be highly variable in specificity, both within e. coli and among enteric bacteria  <cit> .

comparative bacterial genomics of the icr sequence, including its boundary, revealed the same framework genes in the same order, interrupted by a variable region in the same location in other strains of enteric bacteria. in addition to the well-studied e. coli laboratory strain k- <dig>  these strains included another e. coli laboratory strain , the e. coli pathogens cft <dig>  o157:h <dig> and k <dig>  and s. typhimurium lt <dig>  in all the strains, the icr is flanked by the genes yjis and yjia  <cit> . the authors provided evidence that the icr plays the role of a replaceable cassette contributing to variation of restriction enzyme genes in e. coli and its relatives. more recently, the icr was found in e. coli strain a <dig> 34/ <dig> . this strain is efficiently used in the prophylaxis and treatment of nosocomial infections and diarrhoea of preterm and newborn infants in czech paediatric clinics  <cit> . analysis of its genome, by bacterial artificial chromosome  library cloning, revealed that among  <dig> examined bac clones covering the a <dig> 34/ <dig> genome, one  reproducibly conferred on the laboratory strain dh10b an enhanced capacity to persist in the intestine of newborn piglets. sequencing revealed that this bac clone carried genes encoding, among others, a putative restriction-modification system type i  <cit> , identified in rebase  <cit>  by the orf as ecoa0orf42p and designated ecoao83i.

in this paper, we characterized this restriction system by combination of both classical genetics and comparative genomics. we demonstrated the family affiliations based on the strictest requirement for membership of a family; the complementation test and antibody-cross reactivity. using a strategy employing a unique collection of pl and pe plasmids transformation method along with the rm search computer program  <cit> , the dna recognition sequence of the ecoao83i r-m enzyme was determined.

RESULTS
comparative genomics
the hsd genes of the predicted type i r-m system ecoa0orf42p were found on a fragment of approximately  <dig> kb of the c4/ <dig> bac; a location similar to the hsd genes of the enterohaemorrhagic  o157: h <dig> and uropathogenic  cft <dig> strains. this region corresponds to the icr and it is obvious that these hsd genes are allelic  <cit> .

the sequence data and blastp results available on rebase  <cit>  permit a preliminary characterization of the r-m system from the escherichia coli strain a <dig> 34/ <dig>  by comparison of the amino acid identity with the r-m systems from  o157: h <dig>  <cit>  and  cft <dig>  <cit> . the appearance of type ib enzymes ecoai and ecoei  <cit>  on the list of "closest neighbours" strongly suggested that the analysed systems could belong to the same family. the level of identity of both hsdr and hsdm subunits is more than 90%, which is in agreement with the defined rules for the family membership  <cit> . the lower level of identity with the hsdr of ecoei is the known exception  <cit> . comparison with the ecoki  is given for illustration of the low interfamily levels of amino acid identity of hsdr   <cit>  and hsdm  subunits  <cit>  .

the r-m systems cfrai, ecoai and ecoei are prototypes of type ib family, styski identifies the first member of the ib family in salmonella species  <cit> , ecoki is a prototype member of type ia  <cit> . the values are the per cent identity of aligned sequences. ecoa0orf42p is from e. coli a <dig> 34/ <dig> , ecoo157orf5947p is from e. coli o157:h <dig>  ecoko157orf5307p is from e. coli o157:h <dig> sakai strain  <cit>  and ecocftorf5424p is from e. coli cfto <dig>  p means putative r-m system, na – the sequence is not available,  <dig> alignment of the number of aa so far available

comparison of the hsds subunits  revealed strong similarities in the conserved regions, while sequences of trd regions, responsible for recognition of the specific sites on dna, differ significantly. the higher identity between trd <dig> of s.ecoei and s.ecoa0orf42p indicates that the  <dig> bp component of their bipartite recognition site might be either very similar or identical. this amino acid alignment also revealed the direct repeat typical of type ib hsds subunits  <cit> . the first repeat starts  <dig> aa and the second  <dig> aa from the n-terminus.

a the numbers reflect the per cent identity in each of the regions recalculated on the basis of the alignments given by blast in rebase  <cit>  for the entire sequence of s.ecoa0orf42p. the conserved  and variable  regions for type ib are defined according to kannan et al.  <cit> . b only known recognition sequences are shown.

based on the sequence alignment, we conclude that the r-m system predicted in e. coli a <dig> 34/ <dig>  is the new member of type ib family, but is not an isoschizomer of either any prototype of the type ib members or any sequenced putative ib r-m systems. moreover, this comparison revealed that the putative r-m systems ecoo157orf5947p and ecoko157orf5307p are identical and, together with ecocftorf5424p, also should belong in the ib family.

analysis of restriction and modification activities
first, we analysed whether the putative r-m system ecoa0orf42p is functional. individual e. coli dh10b clones harbouring bac c4/ <dig>  plasmid pffp <dig>  and pgc <dig>  were tested for restriction activity using λ.vir .

individual e. coli dh10b clones harbouring bac c4/ <dig> with ecoa0orf42p, plasmid pffp <dig> and pgc <dig> were tested for restriction of λ.vir  <dig> , phage λ.vir specificity of ecoai, ecoei and c4/ <dig> were produced on dh10b , dh10b  and dh10b , respectively. the numbers represent the efficiency of plating  of lambda phage

the plating efficiency of the phage was high only on the strain that carried the hsds subunit of the same specificity as its previous host. this result shows that the system restricts not only λ. <dig>  but also λ.a and λ.e. on the other hand, the phage modified on specificity ecoa0orf42p  was restricted by strains with r-m systems of specificity ecoai and ecoei.

thus, the bac c4/ <dig> encodes a functional, type ib related restriction system, whose target sequence is present on lambda dna but differs from those of known ib enzymes. consequently this r-m system was named ecoao83i.

complementation analysis
the most important rule for estimation of a membership of the same type i family is the complementation test. type i r-m systems detected in lactococcus could be separated into two families according the sequence analysis, showing only  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity of hsdm and hsdr subunits, respectively. nevertheless, as assessed by complementation analysis  <cit> , they belong to one family.

the complementation test is based on the fact that the hsdr and hsdm subunits are interchangeable within the members of a family. we used this test successfully for complementation between ecoki and ecobi enzymes in analysis of temperature sensitive mutants of the ecoki hsds subunit. these tests were performed in vivo using a partial diploid, in which one set of hsd genes was on the chromosome and the second set was provided by an f' plasmid, or vice versa  <cit> .

in this study, the partial diploids were prepared by transforming the bl <dig> strains with a bac c4/ <dig> carrying the hsdr, hsdm and hsds genes of ecoao83i and with plasmids carrying the hsds and hsdm genes of ecoai. in complementation experiments, where the hsds subunits of different specificities are produced in the presence of hsdr and hsdm, there should be a competition between these two hsds subunits for assembly into an endonuclease. the strain should express restriction and modification functions of both of the two specificities. as expected, the hsdr and hsdm subunits of ecoao83i substituted for the hsdr and hsdm subunits of ecoai, as evident from the presence of the two specificities detected after e. coli transformation with plasmids bac c4/ <dig> and pjp <dig> or pjp <dig> . it should be pointed out that competition of hsds ecoai  for missing subunits is more successful when the hsdm subunit is also present . competition of mtase for the hsdr subunit only results in a more efficient restriction of phage λc4/ <dig>  conversely, assembly of sole hsds ecoai subunit with hsdm ecoao83i obviously causes an imbalance of the subunits for assembly of ecoao83i rease, resulting in a two orders of magnitude lower efficiency of restriction of phages λ. <dig> and λ. a. this complementation test confirmed the allocation of ecoao83i to the type ib family.

antibody cross reactivity
antibodies raised against a representative of a known family of r-m enzymes can be very effectively used for serological screens of cell extracts with putative restriction enzymes. antibody cross reactivity is also one of the most strict requirements for membership of a family  <cit> .

proteins of cell-free extract prepared from the bacterial clone dh10b  harbouring the plasmids with hsd genes coding for ecoao83i were separated by sds-page and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunoassay analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ecoki, ecoai, and ecor124i – representatives of ia, ib, and ic families, respectively. no immunological cross-reactivity was observed in the experiments with anti-ecoki and anti-ecor124i antibodies , while hsd subunits were clearly detected by anti-ecoai antibody. the ecoao83i subunits were expressed from chromosomally located hsd genes in the original e. coli ao43/ <dig>  <dig> strain as well as from genes cloned onto bac c4/ <dig> . immunodetection also revealed that the hsds subunit of ecoao83i is smaller than the hsds of ecoai.

identification of the specific recognition sequence
to identify the recognition sequence of the ecoao83i enzyme, a total of  <dig> plasmids were used for transformation . the relative efficiency of transformation  for dh10b  versus dh10b was calculated. plasmids exhibiting eot values lower than  <dig>  were assumed to contain one or more recognition sites  <cit> . analysis of these data with the rm search program  <cit>  revealed only one possible candidate sequence, ggaatgc, without any degeneracy. the 3' trd component of the recognition sequence is identical to ecoei, which is consistent with the aa alignment data .

this sequence exists  <dig> times in phage lambda dna and is shown with the surrounding bases in fig.  <dig>  the sequences show that the 8n portion of the recognition sequence is completely random. the abundance of the target sites explains the strong restriction of phage lambda   <cit> .

the recognition sequence revealed here is identical to the previously reported prototype sequence for eco377i  <cit> . to confirm the predicted recognition sequence, plasmid peco377i was used for transformation. the plasmid contains the predicted sequence in a  <dig> mer oligoduplex  cloned at the ecorv site of pmeca  <cit> . as shown in additional file  <dig>  peco377i was restricted to the 10- <dig> level. to examine the modification status of the plasmids, two plasmids were recovered from the transformation plates. the transformants showed complete modification  on dh10b  cells. the plasmid r-m tests confirmed that the ecoao83i enzyme recognizes and modifies the same target sequence as the eco377i, which strongly supports the pertinence of eco377i prototype to the type ib family. since there is only one adenine on each side of the recognition sequence available for methylation, we assumed that these adenines are the targets for methylation. in this case, the distance between adenines is  <dig>  and corresponds to the type ib family definition  <cit> .

recently, the sequence of another isoschisomer of ecoao83i appeared in rebase  <cit> . this putative r-m system, eco536orf4677p from escherichia coli  <dig>  <cit> , shares 99% aa identity not only between hsdm and hsdr subunits but also between hsds subunits. thus, it is very likely that this putative r-m system is also an isoschizomer of prototype eco377i. it remains to elucidate how broadly this system is spread among e. coli strains.

CONCLUSIONS
putative r-m system ecoa0orf42p in the commensal e. coli strain a <dig> 34/ <dig>  is a functional member of the type ib family and was designated as ecoao83i. dna recognition sequence of ecoao83i was identified as ggaatgc, identical to the previously reported prototype sequence for eco377i and its homologues, which in reverse, allowed us to classify these systems as new members of the type ib family. the 3' trd component of the recognition sequence is identical to ecoei, which is consistent with the aa alignment data.

contribution of the described r-m system to the enhanced persistence of the appropriate clone in the porcine intestine as a model is to be analysed. combination of the classical biochemical and bacterial genetics approaches with comparative genomics might contribute effectively to further classification of many other putative type i enzymes.
