BACKGROUND
the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase- <dig>  is highly regulated by dietary se, decreasing in se deficiency to < 1% of se adequate levels in se-deficient liver  <cit> . this sensitive regulation has made gpx <dig> activity a useful biomarker for determining the dietary requirement for se, which in rodents is  <dig>  μg se/g diet  when based on this marker  <cit> . in addition to gpx <dig> activity, gpx <dig> mrna is also dramatically down-regulated in se deficiency  <cit> , and gpx <dig> mrna can also be used to determine se requirements  <cit> . recently, our study on se-regulation of the full selenoproteome in rats showed that several additional selenoprotein mrnas are highly regulated by se status and can also be used as biomarkers of se deficiency  <cit> . the resulting se requirements based on selenoprotein mrnas  are slightly lower than requirements based on selenoenzyme activity , but importantly, none of these mrnas are further increased in rats fed super-nutritional levels of dietary se up to 8-times the requirement. these studies demonstrated that selenoprotein mrnas are useful molecular biomarkers for se deficiency, but are not effective in assessing high se status.

conventional biomarkers of high se status, such as tissue se concentration and changes in fingernail morphology, are lacking in specificity and sensitivity  <cit> . molecular biomarkers are potentially better predictors of physiological effects associated with high se intakes  <cit> , but so far studies on the transcriptional effects of super-nutritional se have not identified well-regulated molecular biomarkers of high se status. in rodents several microarray studies have found  <dig> to  <dig> genes altered by a se intake of  <dig>  μg se/g as compared to se-deficient diets, but the only consistently regulated genes in these studies were the selenoproteins  <cit> , suggesting that the se-specific effects detected were primarily caused by se deficiency and not high se. studies on the transcriptional effects of se in various cancer cell lines and cancerous tissue have also produced variable results, with little similarity between studies  <cit> . the lack of genes consistently regulated by high se in these microarray studies suggests that the genes so far identified may not be useful as se-specific molecular biomarkers.

the current recommended dietary allowance  for adult humans is  <dig> μg/day , and the tolerable upper intake level  for se in humans has been set at  <dig> μg/day, which is about 8-times the requirement  <cit> . high se intake has long been associated with prevention of cancer  <cit> , but clinical trials of se supplementation for cancer prevention in humans have produced inconsistent results. the nutritional prevention of cancer trial  found that supplementation with  <dig> μg/day of high se yeast  significantly decreased risk for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer in patients with previous skin cancers, although no effect on recurrence of skin cancer was observed  <cit> . more recently, the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial , which enrolled > <dig>  men, found no effect of se supplementation on prostate or any other cancer  <cit> . follow-up studies on the npct subjects, however, found that se supplementation increased the risk of squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> , total cancer incidence  <cit> , and diabetes  <cit>  in subjects with higher initial plasma se levels. furthermore, a significant negative relationship between plasma se level and diabetes risk was observed in national health and nutrition examination survey  2003- <dig> subjects  <cit> , and select found a trend for increased type ii diabetes risk in the se supplemented group  <cit> . these reports of advantages and adverse effects associated with super-nutritional se highlight the need to better understand the transcriptional effects of high se intakes.

to characterize se regulation of the transcriptome, we conducted  <dig> microarray studies in rodents fed diets supplemented with graded levels of se from se-deficient to  <dig> μg se/g diet, or 50-times the requirement. our objectives were to determine the transcriptional response to se deficiency, super-nutritional, and toxic se intakes in our well-characterized rodent model to identify candidates for genes regulated by high se status, to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying how animals homeostatically adapt to high se status, and to determine whether identified se-regulated genes could be used as molecular biomarkers of high se status.

RESULTS
animal growth
in all experiments, initial body weights of treatment groups were not significantly different. in the mouse study and in rat study  <dig> there were no significant differences in growth due to dietary se level  <cit> , consistent with previous studies  <cit> . in rat study  <dig>  however, rats fed  <dig> μg se/g diet had significantly lower body weight as compared to all other diet groups  starting at day  <dig> and continuing for the remainder of the study . in rat study  <dig>  the initial body weight averaged  <dig> g, and the final average weight of rats fed  <dig> μg se/g diet was  <dig> ±  <dig> g vs. an average of  <dig> ±  <dig> g  for all other diet groups.

se status of animals using conventional biomarkers
se concentration in liver, gpx <dig> activity in liver and red blood cells , and gpx <dig> activity in plasma were measured for each study to determine the se status of the animals. the regulation of selenoenzyme activities in the mouse study and rat study  <dig> are described in detail in previous reports using these animals  <cit> . briefly, se concentration and gpx <dig> activity in mouse liver and gpx <dig> activity in rbc dropped in se deficiency to  <dig>   <dig> , and 37%, respectively, of se-adequate  levels, respectively. plasma gpx <dig> activity in se-deficient mice dropped to 13% of se-adequate levels. liver se and gpx activities in mice fed the se-marginal diet  were intermediate between se-deficient and se-adequate mice. in rat study  <dig>  liver and rbc gpx <dig> activities in se deficiency were  <dig> and 24%, respectively, of se-adequate levels , and increased to plateau levels by  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg se/g diet, respectively. in se-deficient rats, plasma gpx <dig> activity was 2% of adequate levels and reached the plateau by  <dig>  μg se/g diet.

liver se concentration in se-deficient rats in both rat study  <dig> and  <dig> decreased to 3% of se-adequate levels  , similar to the mouse study. in rat study  <dig>  liver se increased to a plateau at  <dig>  μg se/g diet, remained at this level until  <dig>  μg se/g diet, and then increased gradually to 180% of se adequate levels in rats fed  <dig>  μg se/g diet  <cit> . in rat study  <dig>  liver se followed exactly the same pattern as in rat study  <dig>  and then increased to 338% and 439% of se-adequate levels in rats fed  <dig> and  <dig> μg se/g, respectively.

in rat study  <dig>  liver gpx <dig> activity in se-deficient rats dropped to 2% of se-adequate  levels  and liver gpx <dig> activities were clearly on the plateau in rats fed > <dig>  μg se/g diet. a decrease in liver gpx <dig> activity to 77% of se-adequate levels was observed in rats fed  <dig> μg se/g diet, similar to previous results  <cit> . this decrease may be attributed to an overall lowering of enzyme activity due to liver damage . liver gpx <dig> activity in se-deficient rats only decreased to 30% of se-adequate levels and reached plateau levels by  <dig>  μg se/g diet , as reported previously  <cit> . while rbc gpx <dig> activity in se-deficient rats from study  <dig> decreased to 26% of se-adequate levels, rbc gpx <dig> activity continued to increase with increasing levels of se supplementation  unlike the other tissues examined. this is consistent with previous reports  <cit> , and is likely attributed to the long half life of rbcs and the relatively rapid development of the young rapidly growing rats, as rbc gpx <dig> activity reaches a defined plateau in older rats  <cit> . plasma gpx <dig> activity in se-deficient rats in rat study  <dig> was  <dig> % of adequate, with a clear plateau above  <dig>  μg se/g diet , similar to rat study  <dig> 

alt and ast activity analyses
the reduced growth in rats fed  <dig> μg se/g diet was the first indication in this study of an adverse effect of this level of dietary se. alanine aminotransferase  and aspartate aminotransferase  activities in plasma were measured as markers of liver damage as these had previously been shown to increase at high se intakes  <cit> . alt activity was significantly increased in  <dig> μg se/g diet rats as compared to all other diet groups, and was approximately twice that of se-adequate  rats . ast activity also showed a significant near 2-fold increase in  <dig> μg se/g rats as compared to se-adequate rats , but in contrast to alt, ast activity was significantly higher in the  <dig> μg se/g and se-deficient rats as compared to se-adequate rats, resulting in a u-shaped curve. increased ast activity in se-deficient plasma has been observed in other studies in our lab .

dietary se regulation of the transcriptome
to determine the effect of se status on general transcription, whole genome microarrays  were used to compare gene expression in the liver or kidney of rodents fed se-deficient and high se diets vs. se-adequate diets. to obtain a global picture of the effect of dietary se on transcription, robust multichip averaging  expression for each se treatment group  was plotted against expression from the se-adequate group . in the mouse study, this analysis showed a relatively tight clustering of expression along the 1: <dig> line for both  <dig> and  <dig>  μg se/g . similarly, analysis of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg se/g datasets from rat study  <dig>  and of  <dig> and  <dig> μg se/g datasets from rat study  <dig> showed tight 1: <dig> expression . in contrast, there was an obvious expanded scattering of expression outside the 2-fold change lines in the  <dig> vs.  <dig>  μg se/g diet analysis , clearly showing the unique transcriptional effects elicited by toxic se intake. the tightness of expression in the  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  μg se and  <dig> vs.  <dig>  μg se analyses are particular striking, given that these levels are  <dig> and  <dig> times the se requirement in the rat  <cit> .

transcriptional regulation by se deficiency
se-deficient treatment groups were included in these microarray studies in order to assess se status across the full range from se-deficient to toxic se status, to further characterize the effect of se deficiency on the transcriptome, and to be able to distinguish the effects of se deficiency from se excess. our previous studies  <cit>  showed that expression of a subset of the  <dig> rodent selenoproteins is down-regulated by se deficiency. for these studies the full complement of non-selenoprotein genes was evaluated for regulation by se status. in the mouse study, se deficiency significantly up-regulated  <dig> genes in liver , with  <dig> additional genes nearly significant  as compared to se-adequate  mice . no genes were significantly up-regulated in se-deficient kidney as compared to se-adequate kidney . similarly, in rat study  <dig> there were only  <dig> genes significantly up-regulated  in se-deficient vs. se-adequate  rats . a few genes or gene families are up-regulated in all  <dig> se-deficient datasets, although these did not reach significance in every treatment. nadh dehydrogenase, quinone  <dig> , and members of the atp-binding cassette subfamily c and glutathione transferase-alpha family were consistently up-regulated by se deficiency.

transcripts that were significantly  or nearly significantly  up-regulated in se-deficient rodent tissues compared to se-adequate . 1fold changes determined by analysis of rma expression data with the limma package in r software, 2p-values were adjusted for multiple testing, 3genes known to be nrf <dig> targets, determined as described in the text,  <dig> genes up-regulated in se-deficient liver from rats in study  <dig> 

se deficiency significantly down-regulated  <dig> genes in mouse liver,  <dig> genes in mouse kidney, and  <dig> genes in rat liver; these were all selenoproteins previously reported to be highly regulated by se  <cit>  , and there were no additional non-selenoprotein transcripts down-regulated by se deficiency. qrt-pcr confirmed microarray-detected se-regulation for selected genes up-regulated in se deficiency, found expression levels up to 8-fold higher in se-deficient mouse liver, and showed that these genes were restored to adequate levels in the mice fed a se marginal diet  . in rats, qrt-pcr confirmed that abcc <dig> and nqo <dig> were increased by se deficiency 4-fold and 2-fold relative to se-adequate levels, but also found that abcc <dig> was increased by  <dig> μg se/g diet to levels not different from levels in se-deficient rat liver .

transcripts that were significantly  or nearly significantly  down-regulated in se-deficient rodent tissues compared to se-adequate . 1fold changes determined by analysis of rma expression data with the limma package in r software, 2p-values were adjusted for multiple testing, 3genes known to be nrf <dig> targets, determined as described in the text, 4genes down-regulated in se-deficient liver from rats in study  <dig> 

transcriptional effects of high se
to determine whether there are transcripts regulated by super-nutritional and toxic se intakes, microarrays were used to analyze expression in rats fed  <dig>   <dig> and 50-times the se requirement as compared to se-adequate rats. rat study  <dig> determined the effect of se status in rats fed up to  <dig>  μg se/g, 8-times the requirement as compared with se-adequate rats . surprisingly, there were no significant gene expression changes with this 10-fold increase in se intake. when compared to se-adequate rats from study  <dig> , there were  <dig> significant gene changes in rats fed  <dig>  μg se/g diet, but these changes are likely due to differences between these independent experiments rather than due to se status. rma expression data plotted for several of the transcripts altered in the  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  μg se/g diet comparison show that expression is changed at  <dig>  and to a lesser extent at  <dig> , while remaining constant at the other se intakes .

as no significant gene expression changes were observed at 8-times the requirement, a second rat study was conducted to assess transcriptional effects of se intakes at  <dig> and 50-times the requirement . gene expression in rats fed  <dig> and  <dig> μg se/g diet was compared with se adequate rats . only  <dig> transcripts  were significantly changed by  <dig> μg se/g, with  <dig> others nearly significant  . the genes up-regulated at  <dig>  μg se/g diet were: rgs <dig>  a regulator of g-protein signaling; ccdc <dig>  which may be involved in extracellular matrix organization; rgd <dig>  a gene of unknown function that contains putative signaling domains; and oxct <dig>  a member of the 3-oxoacid coa-transferase family. the lone down-regulated gene at 20-times the requirement was cirbp, which contains rna binding domains and is thought to stabilize mrnas and enhance translation.

transcripts that were significantly  or nearly significantly  differentially expressed in liver from rats fed  <dig> μg se/g diet compared to  <dig>  μg se/g diet. 1fold changes determined by analysis of rma expression data with the limma package in r software, 2p-values were adjusted for multiple testing, 3genes known to be nrf <dig> targets, determined as described in the text.

in contrast to the few transcripts changed at 20-times the se requirement, there were  <dig> transcripts significantly altered at 50-times the requirement. as the rats fed  <dig> μg se/g diet had reduced growth and elevated markers of liver damage, it was possible that many of these transcripts could be responding to general toxicity and/or caloric restriction. therefore, the  <dig> se toxicity transcripts that overlapped with affymetrix's rattoxfx  <dig>  array  and that overlapped with  <dig> day caloric restriction  data from a recent study   <cit>  were removed, along with redundant transcripts for genes found in rattox or calrestr datasets . after filtering,  <dig> se-specific transcripts remained in this se-specific dataset. this 715-transcript dataset contained  <dig> duplicate transcripts, yielding  <dig> unique transcripts which correspond to  <dig> unique genes for subsequent gominer analyses. most of the unique transcripts were up-regulated, with  <dig> up- vs.  <dig> down-regulated. gominer analysis identified  <dig> biological processes significantly enriched in the se-specific dataset, and these were nearly all related to cell movement/morphogenesis, extracellular matrix , and development/angiogenesis .

gene ontology  identifiers significantly enriched in the  <dig> se-specific genes. 1number of genes involved in this process in the set of all genes on the rat genome  <dig>  <dig>  array, 2number of genes involved in this process in the set of genes specific to se toxicity, 3false discovery rate - ratio of the number of times the se toxicity data gave p <  <dig>  compared to a random set of data

unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the se-specific transcript expression for all  <dig> rat microarrays showed the unique transcriptional response in the rats fed  <dig> μg se/g diet vs. lower se intakes . inspection of the resulting treeview diagram identified clusters of high se-regulated expression in which  <dig> μg se/g diet appeared to have a similar, albeit more variable effect. three clusters containing  <dig> transcripts  were up-regulated to some extent by  <dig> as well as  <dig> μg se/g diet, and one distinct cluster containing  <dig> transcripts  was down-regulated to some extent by  <dig> as well as  <dig> μg se/g diet . functional analysis revealed a set of genes within the clusters that were up-regulated by  <dig> and  <dig> μg se/g that are involved in glucose transport, insulin signaling, or glycoprotein biosynthesis .

identification of high se molecular biomarkers
molecular biomarkers regulated by  <dig> μg se/g may be useful in predicting high se intake that is not yet overtly toxic. genes regulated by  <dig> μg se/g showed several unique expression patterns, which were confirmed by qrt-pcr for the genes in table  <dig>  rgs <dig> and ccdc <dig> expression as assessed by qrt-pcr were up-regulated 8-fold and 2-fold by  <dig> μg se/g, respectively, but to a lesser extent of 4-fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, by  <dig> μg se/g . expression of oxct <dig> and rgd <dig> increased in a dose-response fashion with increasing se intake above the requirement, reaching 2-fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, by  <dig> μg se/g, and 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively, by  <dig> μg se/g . qrt-pcr, however, did not confirm that cirbp decreases with high se supplementation . in addition, several genes with marginal differential expression at  <dig> μg se/g, as determined by rma analysis, were found to be significantly up-regulated 5-fold  or down-regulated 3-fold  when analyzed using qrt-pcr .

individual expression values for the  <dig> transcripts regulated by  <dig> μg se/g and the  <dig> transcripts regulated by se deficiency in rat study  <dig> were subjected to multiple regression analysis against the individual liver se concentrations, with stepwise elimination of transcripts with non-significant correlation coefficients , to yield an equation with the significant correlation coefficients that predicts liver se concentration, as described previously  <cit> . this analysis resulted in a panel of  <dig> transcripts , with an overall correlation coefficient of  <dig>   that accounted for 99% of the variation in liver se concentration over the full range from  <dig> to  <dig> μg se/g diet . in contrast, panels based on conventional liver selenoenzyme activity biomarkers  or blood selenoenzyme biomarkers  only predicted 57% or 80%, respectively, of the variability in liver se concentration.

discussion
in all  <dig> studies presented here, se deficiency did not significantly affect growth, as observed in previous studies  <cit> . in rat study  <dig>  however, a high se intake of  <dig> μg se/g diet significantly decreased growth as compared to intakes ≤  <dig> μg se/g diet. growth defects and other symptoms of se toxicity resulting from intakes of  <dig> to  <dig> μg se/g have been reported in previous studies  <cit> . although growth was not affected by se deficiency, liver se, liver and rbc gpx <dig> activity, and plasma gpx <dig> activity were all dramatically decreased in se-deficient mice and rats as compared to se-adequate animals. gpx <dig> mrna was also significantly down-regulated in se-deficient tissues,  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold, and mrna levels for several other selenoproteins were significantly down-regulated by se deficiency, as we previously reported  <cit> . thus, the se-deficient animals were se-deficient at the biochemical and molecular level, but otherwise indistinguishable from se-adequate animals. liver gpx <dig> activity was not further increased by super-nutritional se, and was slightly decreased by  <dig> μg se/g as compared to the se-adequate diet , most likely due to liver damage.

microarray analysis of > <dig>  transcripts in the liver of rats fed se deficient to  <dig> μg se/g diet found that an intake of  <dig> μg se/g is required to alter the expression of a large set of transcripts. this is the first report of a large and distinct transcriptional response profile induced by se toxicity. in contrast, se intakes less than  <dig> μg se/g diet significantly changed <  <dig> transcripts as compared to a se-adequate intake within an experiment. the distinct transcriptional effect of  <dig> μg se/g correlates with growth and alt activity, the other markers of toxicity measured in this study. the vastly expanded number of gene expression changes observed in this study thus is a newly-identified marker of se toxicity. importantly, as many as half of the  <dig> transcripts altered by the  <dig> μg se/g diet treatment may be se-specific, as  <dig> transcripts still remained after removing transcripts responding to general toxicity and caloric restriction.

previous microarray studies have investigated the transcriptional effects of se supplementation up to  <dig>  μg se/g diet in rodents, of up to  <dig> μg se/day in human subjects, and of up to  <dig> μm se in cultured cells. a search of the se-regulated genes in  <dig> previous se microarray studies  <cit>  found only a few genes that were identified in more than  <dig> study. the only genes regulated by > <dig> studies, however, were selenoproteins, suggesting that most of the genes identified were not responding specifically to high se. many of these studies are complicated by the fact that high se treatments were only compared to se-deficient treatments, so that many of the transcriptional changes are likely to be the result of se deficiency instead of se supplementation. one study that did compare a high se treatment to a se-adequate treatment   <cit> , found no significantly altered genes. based on the present study, it is very likely that the lack of se-specific regulation in these previous studies is due to insufficient se to cause large, significant transcriptional responses. additional studies with near toxic se levels may be necessary to determine whether the transcripts identified in the present study are truly se-specific.

the levels of high se in the present studies  are relevant to high se intakes in humans. a study of chinese subjects living in a high se area of china found no adverse effects of se at intakes of  <dig> μg/day   <cit> . a small supplementation trial in men with prostate cancer gave subjects  <dig> or  <dig> μg se/d as selenized yeast  for about  <dig> months and found no observable adverse effects in the group supplemented with  <dig> μg se/d  <cit> . the subjects supplemented with  <dig> μg se/d, however, reported symptoms of se toxicity, and a few men reached plasma se levels exceeding  <dig> ng/ml, which was reported to be the threshold for the onset of se toxicity in the chinese study  <cit> . these reports in humans agree with the observations from the present study of no adverse effects of intakes up to 20-times the requirement and significant signs of se toxicity at intakes ≥50-times the requirement. additionally, the microarray data presented here indicates that super-nutritional se intakes  <dig> to 20-times the se requirement are not sufficient to cause a large transcriptional response. this is an important point because levels used in cancer prevention trials are typically  <dig> μg/day, or 4-times the requirement, which will bring total se intake to  <dig> to 8-times the requirement depending on dietary se intake from foods. this data thus suggest that cancer prevention associated with super-nutritional se supplementation may not be mediated by transcriptional changes.

se deficiency highly regulates the expression of some, but not all selenoprotein mrnas  <cit> . most notable of the regulated selenoprotein genes is gpx <dig>  with its expression dropping to < 10% of se-adequate levels in the rat model. our recent studies have shown that in addition to gpx <dig>  sepw <dig> and selh are also highly regulated by se deficiency and several other selenoprotein mrnas are moderately regulated  <cit> . interestingly, there were no additional non-selenoprotein genes found to be down-regulated by se deficiency, reinforcing the se-specificity of selenoprotein regulation. importantly, both microarray and qrt-pcr expression of the genes up-regulated in se deficiency show that like selenoprotein mrnas, these genes are restored to adequate levels in the mice fed a se marginal diet  .

a small set of genes were found to be significantly and consistently up-regulated by se deficiency. comparison of these genes with a dataset of  <dig> well-characterized nrf2-targeted genes containing nrf2-binding sites  <cit>  plus a dataset of  <dig> nrf2-targeted genes identified recently by chip analysis  <cit>  revealed that the majority of the genes up-regulated by se deficiency were nrf <dig> targets . nadph dehydrogenase quinone  <dig> , a classic target of nrf <dig>  <cit> , did not reach significance in this study, but was up-regulated  <dig>  to  <dig> fold by se-deficient treatments. similarly, abc transporters  and glutathione s-transferases, are known targets of nrf <dig> regulation  <cit> , and were consistently up-regulated by se deficiency. two of the up-regulated abc transporters, abcc <dig> and abcc <dig>  are reported to be involved in detoxification of a variety of drugs including acetaminophen  <cit> . in comparison, the only gene down-regulated by se-deficiency and overlapping with these nrf <dig> datasets was thioredoxin reductase- <dig> in mouse liver . two additional nrf <dig> target genes, rgs <dig> and tsku, were also found to be up-regulated by  <dig> μg se/g diet . overlap analysis of the  <dig> transcripts that were significantly altered by  <dig> μg se/g diet and the nrf2-regulated gene datasets identified  <dig> nrf <dig> targets that were differentially-regulated in se toxicity , including  <dig> genes retained in the se-specific dataset. the prevalence of nrf2-regulated genes in genes significantly altered by se toxicity as well as up-regulated by se deficiency indicates that se excess as well as se deficiency increases oxidative stress.

functional analysis of the genes in the se-specific dataset indicates their involvement in processes such as cell movement/morphogenesis and development/angiogenesis . ecm-related genes were particularly affected by se toxicity. for example, collagen fibril organization was enriched by a factor of  <dig>  . the genes in this category included four collagen genes , one serine proteinase inhibitor  and one annexin . further searching of the se-specific dataset found a total of seven collagen genes. in addition, many other ecm-related genes were present in the  <dig> μg se/g dataset. collagen genes were also reported to be regulated by se-methylselenocysteine in a prostate cancer cell line , but only one of these  was regulated in the same direction in the present study  <cit> . additional evidence for an association between se and collagen metabolism comes from a study which found that se supplementation of rats with  <dig>  μg se/g diet for  <dig> weeks increased collagen content of the skin, but decreased it in other tissues including liver  <cit> . the regulation of ecm components may also be relevant to the anti-carcinogenic effect of se as the ecm plays an important role in cell migration and tumor progression. in addition, collagen-regulation by se may underlie some physiologic effects of se toxicity, as the symptoms of se toxicity include changes or malformations in tissues comprised primarily of collagen, nails and hair in humans and hooves in grazing animals  <cit> .

genes related to glucose metabolism were enriched in the clusters that were up-regulated to some extent by  <dig> as well as  <dig> μg se/g diet. there is some evidence that high se status is related to diabetes and it is known that a selenosugar is one of the major excretory metabolites for se  <cit> . se-regulation of glucose-related genes may be another piece of the puzzle linking se and glucose metabolism.

we also conducted gominer analysis of the genes that were removed from the original 1193-transcript toxic se dataset due to overlap with genes altered by general toxicity and/or calorie restriction. this analysis identified  <dig> significantly enriched  biological processes that were not specifically associated with se toxicity; these processes appeared to be more varied than those found in the se-specific dataset .

very few transcripts were significantly regulated by the sub-toxic intake of  <dig> μg se/g diet, but there were several clusters of transcripts altered significantly by  <dig> μg se/g which were also variably affected by  <dig> μg se/g diet. two of the conventional biomarkers, growth and alt activity, suggest  <dig> but not  <dig> μg se/g diet is toxic. ast activity, however, suggests that high se intake at  <dig> μg se/g as well as in se deficiency is also just beginning to cause some liver damage. previous studies have reported adverse effects, such as reduced body weight and liver damage, from se intakes as low as  <dig> μg se/g  <cit> . further studies are necessary to determine whether the transcripts within the clusters similarly regulated by  <dig> and  <dig> μg se/g diet would gain significance and correlate with other markers of se toxicity if studied at intakes between  <dig> and  <dig> μg se/g diet. as  <dig> μg se/g diet borders on a toxic se intake, the  <dig> transcripts that were significantly regulated by this treatment may prove to be useful biomarkers of high se intake before adverse effects are observed.

to illustrate the potential utility of a small set of high se regulated transcripts as biomarkers of se status, these transcripts and those regulated by se deficiency were used successfully to predict liver se concentration. liver se concentration was chosen as a marker of se status for this example because it represents a pool of se that continues to increase above the se requirement, similar to hypothetical pools of se associated with the anticarcinogenic activity of se. the resulting 11-gene biomarker panel accounted for 99% of the variability in liver se concentration across the range from se-deficient to toxic se, illustrating the potential of molecular biomarkers to predict se status. comparison of the molecular biomarker panel curve in figure  <dig> with the conventional biomarker curves shown in figure 2b-d clearly illustrates why these conventional biomarkers are ineffective for assessment of high se status.

the high se regulated transcripts identified in this study were associated with high se intake in rats, but these studies did not show that these changes are specific for super-nutritional or toxic se status. the use of transcript datasets associated with general toxicity or calorie restriction reduced the dataset to  <dig> unique transcripts which were more likely to be se-specific, but, as shown by the variety of biological processes enriched in this dataset , it is clear that most of these transcripts are likely to be altered by a variety of conditions, not just high se. the molecular biomarker panel, however, illustrates that it may be possible to identify panels of these transcripts that collectively can be specific for a condition such as high se status. additional studies will be needed to further refine the sets of se-specific transcripts that can be used as biomarkers and to uncover genes and processes associated with se homeostasis and the effects of high se supplementation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that a se intake which affected conventional markers of toxicity in rats  also altered the expression of  <dig> transcripts when compared to se-adequate rats. high, but non-toxic se intakes , however, produced very few expression changes, providing the first evidence that a vastly expanded number of transcriptional changes is a biomarker of se toxicity. over half of the transcripts regulated by se toxicity may be se-specific, as  <dig> transcripts still remained after removing those responding to general toxicity and caloric restriction. genes that respond specifically to se toxicity are enriched in processes related to the extracellular matrix, including a number of collagen genes. in addition to down-regulating selenoprotein genes, se deficiency consistently up-regulated several genes known to be targets of nrf <dig> regulation. the small set of transcripts significantly regulated by  <dig> μg se/g diet combined with those regulated by se deficiency was used to identify a biomarker panel that over the range from se-deficient to 50-times the requirement could account for 99% of the variability in liver se concentration. further studies at se intakes between  <dig> and  <dig> μg se/g diet will be needed to better define the association between transcriptional changes and se toxicity. in addition, microarray studies on toxic se intakes with other forms of se such as selenomethionine, high se yeast and selenate may help to identify regulated transcripts that are specific for different forms of se and ideally even to identify biomarkers specific for high se status regardless of se form.
