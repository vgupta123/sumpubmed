BACKGROUND
introns, first discovered in  <dig>  <cit> , are genomic sequences that are removed from the corresponding rna transcripts of genes. the most abundant class are spliceosomal introns, which are found in the nuclear genomes of all characterized eukaryotes, and rely on spliceosomes – a complex that comprises five rnas and hundreds of proteins – for successful splicing from rna transcripts  <cit> . there are two types of spliceosomal introns:  u <dig> introns, which are the most abundant and are spliced by the u2-type spliceosome, and  the rarer u <dig> introns , which are spliced by the less abundant u12-type spliceosome  <cit> . in this paper we consider only plant u <dig> spliceosomal introns.

a growing number of plant expression studies on chimeric rna have demonstrated that such intron sequences can enhance the level of protein expression, a phenomenon termed intron-mediated enhancement   <cit> . inclusion of an intron in the 5' region of a gene, either in the 5'utr or fused to the 5' portion of the coding sequence, leads to enhanced rna levels  <cit> . while the degree of expression enhancement varies for each intron, up to a 1000-fold increase in protein accumulation has been reported  <cit> . the alteration in rna and protein accumulation is known to act post-transcriptionally  <cit> . nonetheless, the intrinsic determinants of 5'utr ime in plants, especially those within the intron itself, remain poorly defined.

the plant arabidopsis thaliana has a compact genome and generally small introns  <cit> , consistent with the proposed correlation between intron size and genome size  <cit> . on the other hand, the length of intron contributes to the energetic cost of transcription, which is proportional to the length of the transcript produced  <cit> . therefore, the fact that a significant number of 5'utrs contain introns suggests that these, like coding sequence introns, may be functionally important. mechanistically it is possible that the 5'utr introns are involved in ime and act in the nucleus  <cit> , and it has been proposed that ime results from synergistic interactions between the factors involved in the various steps of gene expression from transcription to translation  <cit> . the elevated translational efficiency is most likely due to an increased in the affinity of mrna to ribosomes via their interactions with exon junction complexes , which are deposited on the mrna 20– <dig> nucleotides upstream of introns during splicing  <cit> .

studies on plant introns have revealed a strong nucleotide bias toward t proximal to the ag intron acceptor site, and throughout the intron there is an a/t bias relative to the adjacent exon  <cit> . while these nucleotide biases are believed to be required for efficient intron recognition and splicing in coding region introns  <cit> , for introns that reside within the non-coding regions, there is no nucleotide bias that distinguishes intron from exon sequence. to date there are no studies on the statistical properties of 5'utr introns on the genomic scale in multicellular eukaryotes. here we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of nucleotide composition, intron-position, and intron-length distribution of all the annotated a. thaliana 5'utr u <dig> introns supported by est and cdna data. our results show that, firstly, the density of introns in the 5'utrs is similar to that in the cdss but much higher than that in the 3'utrs; secondly, introns within the 5'utr are not randomly distributed along the utr but are more likely to be located closer to the atg; thirdly, the introns that reside within the 5'utr are, on average, significantly larger than the average intron found in both the cds and 3'utr; and finally, the sequences around the splicing junctions show distinct nucleotide bias that distinguish them from cds and 3'utr introns. our findings indicate that 5'utr introns may be subject to different selective forces from the introns in cdss and 3'utrs, possibly due to a specific regulatory role in gene expression. these observations are exposed in the well-annotated and relatively compact arabidopsis genome.

to complement the bioinformatic analysis, an experimental analysis of the a. thaliana gene ef1α-a <dig> – which has an intron-containing 5'utr – was undertaken in order to investigate what influence 5'utr introns have on gene expression, and how this is affected by intron length. we confirm that the presence of the 5'utr intron in ef1α-a <dig> increases gene expression  <cit>  levels 3-fold in transient assays and over 10-fold in stable transgenic plants. in addition, a deletion series based on the intron length showed that the expression level is dependent either on intron length or distributed motifs dispersed throughout the 5' region of the intron.

RESULTS
bioinformatics analysis
the presence, frequency, length distributions, and structure of introns and exons have been extensively studied  <cit> . while it is known that the presence of a 5'utr intron can enhance gene expression  <cit> , not much is known about the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon. in this study, an extensive bioinformatic analysis of a. thaliana introns was undertaken, using the tair  database  <cit> . this study focuses particularly on the length, position and nucleotide composition of cds and utr introns, in order to characterize the differences between 5'utr, cds and 3'utr introns.

analysis of 5' and 3' untranslated regions
there are  <dig>  annotated protein-coding genes supported by est sequences in the tair database. of these,  <dig>  include both the 5'utr and the 3'utr,  <dig> contain the 5'utr but not the 3'utr,  <dig>  contain the 3'utr but not the 5'utr, and  <dig>  contain neither. considerably more genes were found to lack 5'utr annotation than 3'utr annotation, probably due to the directional construction of cdna libraries from the polya tail. a number of the annotated 5'utr sequences are expected to be only partial sequences; however, this is not expected to greatly affect the conclusions of this paper . many protein-coding genes  contain introns. while the non-coding regions are less likely to include introns, these are more commonly found in the 5'utr:  <dig> % of annotated 5'utrs contain introns; by comparison only  <dig> % of 3'utrs are annotated to include introns. the high number of intron-containing 5'utrs cannot be explained by the 5'utr lengths, as the average 5'utr that has been delimited by est and/or cdna sequences is considerably shorter than the average 3'utr region  =  <dig> nucleotides, uq  =  <dig> nucleotides; 3'utr: median =  <dig> nucleotides, lq =  <dig> nucleotides, uq =  <dig> nucleotides). indeed, table  <dig> shows that the average number of introns per nucleotide is,  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in 5'utrs, cdss and 3'utrs, respectively. since these intron densities are normalized by the total length of sequence, incomplete utr annotation should not greatly bias these results. thus the intron density in 5'utrs is ~60% of the intron density in cdss and ~ <dig>  times the intron density in 3'utrs. in mammals, a marked under-representation of introns in the 3'utrs may be explained by the requirements for nonsense-mediated decay   <cit> . the corresponding under-representation measured here in a. thaliana may indicate that plants utilize a similar nmd pathway.

size distribution of introns within utrs and cdss
intron position in utrs
it has been suggested that the splicing of 5'utr introns would lead to deposition of ejcs, which interact with translation initiation, resulting in translational enhancement  <cit> . if the ejcs facilitate the recruitment of ribosomes, then there may be selection on the position of introns within 5'utrs; specifically there may be an optimal length between the position of the intron within the 5'utrs and the translation start codon. introns closer to the atg would recruit the ejc and facilitate an interaction between the rna, trans-factors and the ribosome. we compared the observed 5'utr intron position distributions with the distributions that would be expected if introns were distributed uniformly  throughout 5'utrs – calculated using monte-carlo simulations . figure  <dig> presents the distribution of intron positions within the 5'utrs, relative to the beginning and end of the corresponding 5'utrs. clearly, the actual position distribution of 5'utr introns relative to either the beginning, or the end, of the 5'utr deviates from the expected distribution. it appears that the introns are more frequently located distant from the beginning of the 5'utr , and more frequently located proximal to the end of the 5'utr . although incomplete 5'utr annotation may result in some bias in the absolute positional distributions, since the monte carlo model distribution is based on the same 5'utr sequences, the deviations from the expected distribution are real. the proximity of 5'utr introns to the translation start site is consistent with a role that involves a function in translation, given the simple model of translation we are using. this could be achieved through alteration in the secondary structure of the 5'utr leader either directly through the act of recruiting the spliceosomal complex during splicing or through the deposition of ejc proteins following processing. recently the secondary structure of 5'utrs has been shown to influence post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> ; it is interesting to speculate whether the presence of an ejc could influence rna folding and the consequences of this for gene regulation. further experiments to alter the 5'utr intron position will clarify if this has any biological role in post-transcriptional regulation.

nucleotide conservation around the splice junctions
an investigation of the nucleotide preference around the splice junctions allows a more detailed comparison between the utr introns and the cds introns. sequence logos  <cit>  were created to visualize the nucleotide conservation around the splicing donor  and the splicing acceptor  junctions for each of the intron categories 5'utr, cds and 3'utr . the resulting logos are presented in figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig> . only six and eight nucleotides of exon sequence from the donor and acceptor sites, and  <dig> nucleotides of intron sequence were included in each sequence logo, as there was no noticeable nucleotide bias outside these regions. the sequence logos shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> present all the canonical fingerprints of introns, namely the g/gt and ag/g splice site consensus, and the at-rich element, which is a key feature for efficient splicing in plant introns  <cit> . there is, however, a significant c-rich region near the donor site of 5'utr introns   that does not appear to be present in either cds or 3'utr introns. there is also an increase in the occurrence of g and c residues in the region near the acceptor sites of 5'utr introns  . these sequence biases could be necessary for the spliceosomal recognition of introns within non-coding sequence; however, these sequence biases are particular to the 5'utr and are not seen within the 3'utr, so their role cannot be general to non-coding introns. further experimental analysis of the post-transcriptional and pre-translational effect of altering these sequences is necessary before any biological significance can be attributed to these observations.

molecular analysis of effects of introns in 5'utrs on gene expression
in order to investigate the effects of 5'utr introns on gene expression, the annotated intron-containing 5'utr of ef1α-a <dig>  from a. thaliana was fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the ti binary vector pgreenii 0800-luc  <cit> , resulting in plasmid pgef1i . in addition, each 5'utr was modified to represent an intronless version of the original pgef1idel . in removing the intron, the exon sequence of the 5'utr was not altered and resembled an accurately processed 5'utr. the resulting plasmids were then analyzed via agrobacterium-mediated transient infiltration into nicotiana benthamiana leaves, followed by dual-luciferase assay  <cit> . the assay system measures the enzyme activity of the experimental reporter, firefly luciferase , as well as the enzyme activity of the control reporter, renilla luciferase , which provides an internal control and is under the transcriptional regulation of the 35s promoter. thus, the activity of the luc can be normalized by the activity of the ren, in order to minimize experimental variability such as differences in expression caused by different plants, leaf age and infiltration volume. figure  <dig> presents the relative luciferase assay of pgef1i and pgef1idel, and is a typical dataset from a dual-luciferase assay: here six independent infiltrations were assayed for each of the plasmids under investigation. as the data fit a linear regression well , the regression gradient and its standard error were taken as the measurement of reporter gene activity. the relative expression of pgef1i is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and pgef1idel is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicating a significant  enhancement of reporter gene activity under the presence of the 602-nucleotide 5'utr intron. this data is consistent with ime requiring transcription, and acting post-transcriptionally on rna to influence either stability or translatability.

confirmation of transient assay data in stable transgenic a. thaliana
we also generated transgenic arabidopsis to confirm the level of ime obtained in transient assay data for the pgef1i and pgef1idel fusions. the plasmids used for our transient assay were modified to contain the plant kanamycin transformation selection gene and transformed into a. thaliana 'columbia' by the floral dip method  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the absolute luc activity for two leaves from each of  <dig> independent t <dig> plants transformed with the intron-containing ef1α-a <dig> 5'utr, and from each of  <dig> independent t <dig> plants transformed with the intronless ef1α-a <dig> 5'utr. in all these transgenic lines, the renilla luciferase gene was inactive, despite being under the transcriptional control of the 35s promoter. therefore the relative expression of luc was not determined. it is not unusual for some reporter genes to become inactivated during the transformation process  <cit> , though zero out of  <dig> is unusual and may reflect a higher susceptibility of the renilla luciferase gene to this form of gene-silencing. this transgene silencing is probably because of a post-transformation event, such as methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing  <cit> . nonetheless, although there is much variability in the absolute levels of luc activity, expressed as relative light units per mg of leaf fresh weight, there is a striking elevation in the level of luc expression from those transgenic lines transformed with an intron in the 5'utr relative to those without a 5'utr intron . this is consistent with the transient expression data. these t <dig> lines were not analyzed for t-dna copy number, so some of the variability between transgenic lines containing the same construct could be due to the number of t-dna insertions in each of the transgenic lines.

effect of a viral suppressor of silencing on intron-mediated enhancement
post-transcriptional gene silencing  or rnai is a mechanism that is used to degrade rna transcripts after they have been transcribed  <cit> . ptgs is activated by dsrna to produce sirna that can act as signalling molecules, promoting a cascade of mrna degradation  <cit> . as ime is a post-transcriptional regulation, it is possible that the inclusion of certain introns within the 5' region of a gene reduces the rna's susceptibility to sirna, through some unknown mechanism. in order to assess the involvement of ptgs in ime, a similar transient assay using plasmids pgef1i and pgef1idel  was performed using a modified version of the psoup helper plasmid that is able to suppress gene silencing  <cit> . to suppress gene silencing the p <dig> expression cassette from pbin 61-p <dig> was cloned into psoup and therefore resident within the same agrobacterium cell as the dual-luciferase reporter cassette. the p <dig> enzyme is a viral silencing suppressor from the tomato bushy top virus , which prevents activation of ptgs  <cit> . although gene expression of both the luc and ren reporter genes are enhanced when co-expressed with p <dig>  both with and without the intron, under the presence of p <dig>  the enhancement achieved by the presence of the 5'utr intron was consistent with the relative enhancement that is obtained without p <dig> . as the ime levels in the presence and absence of p <dig> are similar, we conclude that no component of this ime can be attributed to ptgs.

partial deletion of the ef1α-a <dig> 5'utr intron
one of the most prominent observations from the bioinformatics analysis was the dramatic difference in the length distribution of 5'utr introns compared with both cds and 3'utr introns . to test the influence of 5'utr intron size on post-transcriptional enhancement, a series of truncated ef1α-a <dig> 5'utr introns were generated. fifty nucleotides up and downstream of the intron acceptor and donor site were maintained for splicing efficiency so as not to interfere with the possible role of intron sequence proximal to these splicing junction sites. figure  <dig> is a schematic representation of the nine intron deletions used in this experiment, grouped according to the position of the deletion point relative to the 3' region of the intron. figure  <dig> presents the relative luciferase activity for each of these constructs, along with the complete intron, and the intronless reporter-luc fusions. comparing the differences in reporter gene expression for each series of constructs that retain the same 3' portion of the intron sequence , shows a clear positive correlation between gene expression and intron length: the longer the intron, the greater the relative level of luc activity . on the other hand, if constructs are grouped by their 5' end, there is no obvious correlation between intron length and luc activity.

these observations suggest that ime in ef1α-a <dig> is mediated by, not one, but three or more elements distributed over the 5'  <dig> nucleotides of the 5' utr intron, with relatively little effect from the 3'  <dig> nucleotides. indeed, multiple at-rich stimulatory elements have been previously described in plants  <cit> . and, consistent with this, the ef1α-a <dig> 5' utr intron is at-rich. it is interesting that the three inferred ime elements – distributed over  <dig> nucleotides – require a very significant 'increase' in intron length when compared with the median lengths . potentially, this offers an explaination as to why the median 5'utr intron length is so much greater than the median cds intron length, although experiments on more genes would be required to confirm this.

CONCLUSIONS
a growing number of plant expression studies have revealed that the presence of an intron within the 5'utr induces enhanced rna and protein accumulation. however, the intrinsic determinants of 5'utr ime in plants, especially the role of any sequence motifs within the intron, remain poorly defined. in this paper, we have presented extensive statistical analyses of all the annotated a. thaliana 5'utr introns in the tair database and shown that 5'utr introns are noteworthy in terms of their nucleotide composition around the splicing donor and acceptor site, the distribution of intron sizes and the position distribution within the utr and proximity to the atg start codon. in addition, we have shown that, not only can the presence of an intron in the 5'utr significantly enhance gene expression in at least one gene, but the length of intron also influences the level of gene expression. these results should be beneficial in determining the mechanism of ime in plants, as well as determining the origin and role of 5'utr introns. as these introns are not embedded within coding sequence, the flanking nucleotides can be modified without interfering with the open reading frame . we believe that this makes the introns that reside within non-coding sequences a powerful resource to assist in unravelling the role of introns within the genome.
