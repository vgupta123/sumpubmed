BACKGROUND
the gram-negative bacteria sinorhizobium meliloti and s. medicae are able to interact with roots of medicago sativa  to form nitrogen-fixing nodules and survive as a free living saprophytic bacterium in the soil  <cit> . the host, alfalfa is the most important forage legume crop in the arid and semi-arid areas of north africa. in these areas, alfalfa is grown in marginal soils and frequently subjected to abiotic and biotic stresses can affect both alfalfa and its nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria in the root nodules  <cit> .

in recent years, due to the reduced need for application of nitrogenous fertilizers, the rhizobia have gained a great agricultural value and play an important role in improving soil fertility in farming systems  <cit> . inoculation of alfalfa with efficient strains of the rhizobia has significant economical and ecological benefits  <cit> . however, the presence of natural strains of rhizobia in the soils, usually highly competitive and well adapted to certain environment can reduce the inoculation benefits even with highly efficient strains. in addition, especially in marginal soils of arid and semi-arid regions, survival and effective functioning of natural and inoculated rhizobia populations are reduced by high soil temperatures, salt and osmotic stress, soil acidity, alkalinity and heavy metals in soils  <cit> . added to this challenge, the rhizobia must cope with above abiotic stresses and they must survive as saprophyte and persist in such marginal soils in the absence of host plants  <cit> . thus, knowledge about the diversity in natural population pertaining to above stresses is necessary before the selection and application of the tolerant strains of rhizobia for biological nitrogen fixation.

although, phenotypic and genotypic diversity of some species of rhizobia are available  <cit> , little is known about such diversity in natural populations of sinorhizobium nodulating alfalfa in the marginal soils of arid and semi-arid regions, which are affected by salinity and frequent droughts. thus, it is important to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic diversity and genetic structure of natural populations of the rhizobia in the marginal soils.

the use of molecular techniques has facilitated the development of rapid and simple methods for genetic diversity and genetic structure analysis of natural microbial populations. studies utilizing restriction fragment length polymorphism-pcr, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, 16s ribosomal dna analysis, repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr , and dna re-association have revealed extensive genetic variability of microbial communities in soils  <cit> . the rep-pcr method is more versatile and efficient than other methods for fingerprinting of bacterial isolates  <cit> ; the generated pcr fingerprints are unique to each isolate in s. meliloti and group them at the strain level  <cit> . the variation determined with rep- and eric-pcr  <cit>  was also shown to correlate with the measurement of genetic diversity using data generated by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  <cit> . thus, rep- and eric-pcr methods are very useful for genetic diversity and population genetic structure analysis of sinorhizobium nodulating alfalfa.

in this study, we have sampled sinorhizobium isolates nodulating alfalfa from marginal soils affected by salt and frequent droughts in arid and semi-arid regions of morocco where alfalfa is being grown. the objectives of our work were: firstly, to characterized phenotypic diversity of the sampled isolates for tolerance to water and salinity stresses, extremes of temperature and ph, heavy metals and antibiotics in vitro; secondly, to estimate genetic diversity and genetic structure of the rhizobia populations in marginal soils of arid and semi-arid regions of morocco; and finally, to relate the phenotypic and genotypic diversity in order to study whether the isolates within a phenotypic cluster derived from a single or very few lineages.

RESULTS
high degree of phenotypic diversity in the rhizobia populations from marginal soils
in this study we found that alfalfa in morocco is nodulated by s. meliloti and s. medicae. out of  <dig> sampled isolates,  <dig> and  <dig> isolates were identified as s. meliloti and s. medicae, respectively. s. medicae isolates were observed only in the samples collected by soil trapping method.

marginal soil is a complex environment where rhizobia growth and development can be influenced by several environmental stresses. among them, salinity and water stresses, high temperature and ph and heavy metal stresses are very important; and are prevalent in alfalfa growing regions of morocco .

the phenotypic characterization of the sampled  <dig> isolates for above characters revealed a large degree of variation .

salinity is an important stress for rhizobia, because it inhibits persistence and development  <cit> . consequently, a selection of rhizobia strains tolerant to salinity is of great importance for alfalfa cultivation in salt-affected areas. indeed, after screening  <dig> isolates for salt tolerance, we observed a wide variability for tolerance at 171- <dig> mm  nacl ; even isolates sampled from the same area/region showed variation for nacl tolerance .  <dig> % of the isolates  had good tolerance to nacl , indicating that the rhizobia nodulating alfalfa are more tolerant compared to other rhizobia species  <cit> . four s. meliloti isolates  had greater tolerance to salt , which were sampled from the highly salt-affected areas of southern morocco, than others, indicating that saline soils naturally select strains more tolerant to salinity, and results in higher recovery of salinity-tolerant strains.

the isolates recovered displayed tolerance response to water stress,  <dig> % of the isolates grew at water stress of - <dig>  mpa . eighty isolates  that grew under salinity stress also grew under water stress. the common effect of salt and drought on rhizobia results in osmotic stress, which leads to changes in rhizobia morphology  <cit>  and dehydration of cells. some other authors  <cit>  opined that the tolerant rhizobia accumulate osmolytes in response to the osmotic stress, which helps them to overcome effects of osmotic stress due to salinity and water stresses.

for the most rhizobia, optimum temperature range for growth of culture is 28-31°c, and many cannot grow even at 37°c  <cit> . at  <dig>   <dig> and 36°c, respectively,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> % of the isolates grew well . however, at 40°c, only  <dig> % of the isolates  grew and these highly tolerant isolates were sampled from hot and dry regions of southern morocco , complementing the similar observations made in cowpea rhizobia  <cit> , in which they suggested that sampling from hot and dry areas facilitate selection for high temperature tolerance from the natural rhizobia populations.

there was a varied response of the isolates tested to ph . all the isolates tested grew in alkaline ph . at very low ph , only  <dig> % of isolates grew normally. our study further confirmed that the alfalfa rhizobia are acid-sensitive  <cit>  and most isolates only tolerated acidity of ph  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> .

the sampled isolates showed good tolerance to heavy metals such as mn, zn and cd . the highest number of isolates grew well in  <dig> μg/ml cd , followed by  <dig> μg/ml mn  and  <dig> μg/ml zn ; and the growth of almost all isolates was inhibited by hg .  <dig> isolates of s. medicae were tolerant to the heavy metals . our study showed that s. meliloti and s. medicae were more tolerant to the heavy metals than the other rhizobia species  <cit> . since, the soils in the sampling sites were high in these heavy metals content, they might have exerted selection pressure on the rhizobia population  <cit> , resulting in evolution of more tolerant strains.

the evaluation of intrinsic resistance to antibiotics showed that most tested isolates  had high resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and spectinomycin . however, the degree of resistance to antibiotics was higher than in other species of rhizobia  <cit> , indicating that s. meliloti and s. medicae had higher levels of tolerance to these antibiotics.

isolates with different phenotypes were observed within a sampling location. the cluster analysis based on phenotypic data further revealed that these isolates represented phenotypically diverse populations. the  <dig> isolates formed  <dig> clusters .

cluster p- <dig> consisted of three isolates; with different areas of origin. all isolates grew at 40°c, in the medium supplemented with 5% nacl , were resistant to water stress , and sensitive to heavy metals, streptomycin and tetracycline.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of  <dig> isolates from seven different areas. these isolates had a diversity of salt tolerance. all isolates grew in neutral-alkaline ph; and showed good growth at water stress of - <dig>  mpa.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of only two isolates from the rich  area, and were very sensitive to salinity, but resistant to water stress.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of nine isolates from seven different areas. all isolates grew at 40°c, were highly resistant to salinity  and to water stress .

cluster p- <dig> consisted of  <dig> isolates that were sensitive to salinity stress, had a wide range of diversity for water tolerance, and were resistant to heavy metals and antibiotics.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of  <dig> isolates. all grew at 40°c, were resistant to heavy metals, and sensitive to streptomycin. they also grew at ph  <dig> - <dig>  and in medium supplemented with 1-4% nacl. these isolates had a wide range of water stress tolerance.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of  <dig> isolates. all grew in medium supplemented with 6% nacl, at water stress level of - <dig>  mpa and were resistant to heavy metals and antibiotics.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of  <dig> isolates that were resistant to heavy metals and to antibiotics. they grew at 32-40°c, 3-4% nacl, and had good tolerance to water stress.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of four isolates, sensitive to zn and resistant to antibiotics. they could grow at neutral-alkaline ph, were tolerant to water stress and to 5% nacl.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of four isolates. all grew at 40°c, tolerant to salinity, water stress and were sensitive to heavy metals and streptomycin.

cluster p- <dig> consisted of nine isolates that grew in medium supplemented with 3% nacl, and had a wide range of tolerance to temperature, water stress and heavy metals. all isolates were sensitive to tetracycline.

the phenotypic patterns observed in the cluster analysis clearly showed tolerance to the multiple environmental stresses which are common in marginal soils of arid and semi-arid regions. this kind of phenotypic diversity observed in the rhizobia populations could offer selective advantages in survival and adaptation to these harsh environments.

genotyping with rep-pcr resolved phenotypic diversity in s. meliloti and s. medicae
rep-pcr analysis of consensus sequences rep and eric, capable of amplifying repetitive and conservative elements diffused/dispersed in dna, revealed high intraspecific diversity among the  <dig> isolates and classified the isolates into  <dig> genotypes. among the genotypes, only three genotypes were observed  <dig> times and one genotype was found  <dig> times and the remaining genotypes were detected only once. these identical genotypes were considered as clones and these clonal isolates were found only in s. meliloti. since, each genotype characterized by unique combination of rep-pcr profiles, these genotypes can be considered as different strains.

the dendrogram was constructed based on the genotype profiles and provided more information on the specific variability of the strains . at 84% level, there were  <dig> definitely separated and delimited clusters of strains. each cluster contained strains with a range of phenotypic diversity. each cluster was formed by strains from different areas of collection and with different phenotypic traits, except the cluster g- <dig> . in other words, within the same location/region of collection, the strains architecture was phenotypically and genetically divergent. many strains belonging to various physiological groups  were also distributed in various different  clusters of the rep-pcr analysis, indicating they were genetically divergent isolates and there was no relationship between genetic profiles and phenotypes.

to study the extent of diversity at different rep-pcr loci, within sampling locations, regions and within phenotypic groupings, the genetic diversity index  was estimated . the analysis showed that high genetic diversity for within sampling locations  and within regions  for s. meliloti. for s. medicae, all the isolates were genetically different. genetic diversity within phenotypic clusters for all the rhizobia were also high .

exposure of alfalfa rhizobia to marginal soils with various stresses could have increased the phenotypic and genotypic diversity. it is possible that exposure of rhizobia to different niches of marginal soils which differ greatly in physical and chemical properties within soil complex may have resulted in evolution of wide diversity, which is necessary for their adaptation. the evolutionary processes  <cit>  such as mutation, selection, gene flow/migration and recombination might have played a major role in the evolution of environmental stress tolerance and resulted in observed high diversity. mutations generated variability; and marginal soil conditions and the host selected the adaptive variability in natural environments. other processes like gene flow/migration and genetic exchange/recombination might have contributed to generation of a large number of genotypes with similar phenotypes.

exposure of soybean rhizobia to stressful tropical environments had increased the number of rep-pcr profiles  <cit> ; and exposure of clover rhizobia to toxic heavy metals resulted in evolution of diverse genotypes with many metal tolerance phenotypes  <cit> , supported our findings.

it had been envisaged that tolerance to the environmental stresses such as salinity, osmotic stress, heavy metal toxicity and low ph is a complex process, involving many different genes present on chromosome and plasmids  <cit>  and the stressful environment might have favored exchange, acquisition or modification of these genes, resulting in increased tolerance to the stresses.

we sampled both sensitive and tolerant types of rhizobia from marginal soils affected by salinity, drought, higher temperature and ph, and higher levels of heavy metals . both sensitive and tolerant strains might have been maintained by the local cultivars of alfalfa by providing these rhizobia with protective niches , thereby contributing to increased phenotypic and genotypic diversity. the rhizobia surviving in such microniches are further protected by their ability to invade roots and form symbiotic relationship with the plants.

spatial scale comparison of genetic structure
the differences in genetic structure of the rhizobia populations at regional levels were assessed by amova. the largest proportion of significant  genetic variation was found within regions  than among the regions , indicating regional subdivision of the genetic variability.

to study the extent of regional subdivision of the variability, population differentiation  in some of the salinity and drought affected alfalfa growing regions of morocco, was estimated only for s. meliloti populations with more than  <dig> isolates . the population differentiation  was moderate and ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

very low percentage of clonal lineages and occurrence of a high degree of genetic variability among isolates observed in this study, suggesting that genetic recombination might have played an important role in generating new genotypes, which had profound influence on the genetic structure of natural populations.

genetic recombination processes such as conjugation, transduction, and transformation allow the transfer of genes among rhizobia and may result in linkage equilibrium for their genes. however, many bacteria including some rhizobia species showed strong linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . to study linkage disequilibrium in s. meliloti populations, the index of association   <cit>  was estimated  for each region which consisted of  <dig> or more genotypes. a significant  multilocus linkage disequilibria  was observed for isolates from rich errachidia, ziz and jerf erfoud regions, which apparently indicates restricted recombination between alleles at different loci. ld calculated  for all the isolates was also significant. strong linkage disequilibrium reflects either infrequent mixis of genotypes within local populations or results instead from limited migration between geographically isolated populations  <cit> . in our study, the regions which showed strong linkage disequilibrium also showed moderate population differentiation, suggesting that limited migration between populations and frequent mixis within populations in marginal environments contributed substantially to linkage disequilibrium in s. meliloti populations. in a previous study, exhibition of strong linkage disequilibrium in rhizobium leguminosarum biovar phaseoli populations had been also attributed to limited migration between populations and frequent mixis within populations  <cit> . selection for epistatic combinations of alleles at different loci can also maintain linkage disequilibrium in the face of frequent recombination, since such situations could be common under stressful environments, where rhizobia had to evolve for tolerance to multiple stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we observed that alfalfa in morocco are nodulated not only by s. meliloti but also by s. medicae. we found high degree of phenotypic and genotypic diversity in s. meliloti and s. medicae populations from marginal soils affected by salt and drought, in arid and semi-arid regions of morocco. large molecular variability as reflected by rep-pcr analysis, was distributed within regions than between regions. it is possible that exposure of rhizobia to different niches of marginal soils which differ in physical and chemical properties within soil complex might have resulted in wide diversity we observed. the rhizobia isolates from the marginal soils of morocco were genetically divergent and there was no relationship between genotypic profiles and the phenotypes. some of the strains tolerant to salinity and water stresses have a potential for exploitation in salt and drought affected areas for biological nitrogen fixation in alfalfa. it has been shown that under drought stress, co-inoculation of leguminous plants with rhizobia and other plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria resulted in augmented plant productivity and drought tolerance  <cit> .
