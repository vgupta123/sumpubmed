BACKGROUND
plants frequently encounter abrupt environmental changes, such as temperature extremes and drought and salt stresses, in their natural habitats. therefore, they have developed versatile defense mechanisms to cope with adverse growth conditions, which would underlie the astonishing diversity in plant architecture and physiology
 <cit> . low temperatures severely influence diverse aspects of plant growth and development, resulting in global loss of crop yields and productivity
 <cit> . upon exposure to low temperatures, plants execute a series of adjustments in molecular genetic, physiological, and behavioral processes, which are termed cold acclimation
 <cit> .

during the last decade, numerous genes have been identified and functionally characterized in plant response to low temperatures, and underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling schemes have been established in many plant species, mostly in arabidopsis <cit> . cold acclimation enhances plant tolerance to low temperatures by inducing a large set of genes, among which cold-regulated  genes are best characterized
 <cit> . the promoters of many cor genes contain one or more copies of the widely conserved cis-acting element, c-repeat/dehydration response element  having the ccgac core sequence
 <cit> , indicating that multiple cold responses are coordinately regulated by common regulators.

it has been shown that a small group of transcription factors, designated c-repeat binding factors  that belong to the apetala2/ethylene-response element binding protein  transcription factor family
 <cit> , bind directly to the promoters of the cor genes
 <cit> . the cbf genes are induced under low temperature conditions. the cbf regulation of cor genes constitutes a major cold signaling pathway, termed the cbf-cor regulon
 <cit> , which regulates a wide array of cold response genes. the cbf gene expression is also modulated by upstream regulators. recent studies have shown that inducer of cbf expression  <dig> , high expression of osmotically responsive gene  <dig> , and myb <dig> function upstream of the cbf genes
 <cit> . ice <dig> binds to the cbf <dig> gene promoter to induce gene expression
 <cit> . in contrast, myb <dig> binds to the cbf gene promoters, resulting in suppression of the cbf genes
 <cit> . the cold signaling attenuator hos <dig> is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that degrades ice <dig> and thus compromises extreme cold responses that are harmful to plants
 <cit> .

in arabidopsis, six cbf genes have been identified, among them cbf <dig>  cbf <dig>  and cbf <dig> are involved in the regulation of cold-related gene expression
 <cit> . these three cbf genes are induced at low temperatures
 <cit> . they are also induced under other abiotic stress conditions, such as drought and high salt
 <cit> . in contrast, the cbf <dig> gene is not induced at low temperatures but induced under drought and salt stress conditions
 <cit> . transgenic plants overexpressing cbf <dig> or cbf <dig> exhibit improved cold tolerance, and cor genes are upregulated in the transgenic plants
 <cit> . notably, the transgenic plants are also tolerant to salt and drought stresses
 <cit> , suggesting that the cbf function is not restricted to cold acclimation. the cbf <dig> gene has been known as a negative regulator of cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> . it has been observed that cbf2-deficient mutants are tolerant to cold temperatures, and cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> genes are induced in the mutants
 <cit> . it is likely that the expression of cbf genes is elaborately modulated through a negative feedback loop, which may be related with the expression kinetics of the cbf genes: gradual reduction of the transcript levels following the peaks right after cold exposure
 <cit> .

recent molecular genetic and bioinformatic studies indicate that the cbf-cor regulon is conserved in a wide variety of monocots and dicots, such as barley, chinese cabbage, rice, and wheat
 <cit> , signifying the physiological significance of cold accumulation in plants under fluctuating temperature conditions. brachypodium distachyon is a temperate wild grass species that has been explored as a monocot model for studies on wheat and barley because of their genetic and genomic structural similarities
 <cit> . in addition, its morphological and genetic characteristics, relatively well-established molecular tools, and simple growth requirements make it an ideal model system for bioenergy grass biology
 <cit> . a potential target of engineering bioenergy grass, such as switchgrass and miscanthus, is cold stress tolerance, which is intimately linked with grass productivity
 <cit> . however, cold-responsive genes have not been functionally characterized, and related signaling pathways have not been established in brachypodium as well as in bioenergy grass.

in this study, with an aim of extending our understanding on temperature responses in brachypodium, we isolated three potential cbf genes  that are responsive to cold and functionally characterized their roles in abiotic stress responses via transgenic approaches. similar to the roles of cbf genes in arabidopsis, the bdcbf genes was induced under various abiotic stress conditions, and transgenic brachypodium plants were tolerant to cold, drought, and salt stresses. the bdcbf genes were also functional in arabidopsis, and cold response genes were upregulated in the transgenic arabidopsis plants that exhibit enhanced tolerance to freezing, drought, and high salt conditions. these observations indicate that the cbf-cor regulon and related cold signaling pathways are conserved in brachypodium.

RESULTS
isolation of bdcbf genes
we searched for key regulators of cold responses in the brachypodium genome , with emphasis on cbf homologues. through blast searches using the arabidopsis cbf <dig>  cbf <dig>  and cbf <dig> proteins as baits, we identified  <dig> potential cbf homologues that have sequence similarities of higher than 50% throughout the full amino acid sequences to the arabidopsis cbf proteins . the identified brachypodium cbf homologues have residue numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  recently, it has been shown by microarray assays that many of the brachypodium cbf genes are cold-responsive
 <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cbf homologues are classified into  <dig> clades , among which  <dig> cbf homologues belonging to clade iv are somewhat distant from those belonging to clades i to iii . in addition, the clade iv members have not been determined whether they are cold-responsive or not
 <cit> . the cbf homologues belonging to clades i to iii were designated bdcbfs . clade i contains a single member , which was designated bdcbf <dig>  clade ii contains  <dig> members: bradi1g <dig>  was designated bdcbf <dig>  and bradi1g <dig>  as bdcbf <dig> . the other  <dig> bdcbf members belong to clade iii, among which bradi4g <dig>  was designated bdcbf <dig>  and the other members as bdcbf <dig>  to bdcbf <dig> .

the ap <dig> dna-binding domains of the bdcbf <dig>  bdcbf <dig>  and bdcbf <dig> proteins have sequence identities of higher than 70% with those of monocot cbf proteins . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bdcbf proteins are evolutionally close to those from barley and wheat , which have been functionally characterized
 <cit> . the structural conservation and phylogenetic relationship of the cbf proteins would reflect the close genetic relationship between brachypodium and the small grain cereals
 <cit> . based the sequence analysis data, we hypothesized that the bdcbf proteins, and related cold signaling pathways as well, would be functionally conserved in brachypodium.
 <cit> . bootstrap values  based on  <dig> replicates are shown.

binding of bdcbf transcription factors to the promoters of cold-responsive genes
the cbf proteins function as transcription factors that bind to the crt/dre elements of cold-responsive genes in many plant species
 <cit> . we therefore assumed that the bdcbf proteins possess transcriptional activation activity in the regulation of cold-responsive genes in brachypodium.

we first examined the subcellular localization of the bdcbf <dig> protein. a green fluorescence protein -coding sequence was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of the bdcbf <dig> cdna sequence, and the bdcbf1-gfp gene fusion was expressed transiently in brachypodium protoplasts. the results showed that the bdcbf <dig> protein is localized exclusively in the nucleus .
 <cit> . five measurements were averaged and statistically treated using the student t-test . bars indicate standard error of the mean. d. emsa assays. recombinant bdcbf1-his fusion protein and radiolabeled dna were used. both wild-type and mutated crt sequences  were included in the assays. excess amounts of unlabeled bs  dna fragments were also included in the assays to verify specific binding of bdcbf <dig> to the crt sequences. arrowhead indicates protein-dna complexes. bs, crt sequence; mbs, mutated bs.

we next examined whether bdcbf <dig> possesses transcriptional activation activity by employing a gal <dig> transient expression system in brachypodium protoplasts
 <cit> . the bdcbf <dig> cdna sequence was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of the gal <dig> dna-binding domain -coding sequence in the effector vector . the effector vector, the reporter vector having the β-glucuronidase gene , and the vector containing the renilla luciferase gene, which was included as internal control to normalize the measurements, were cotransformed into brachypodium protoplasts. measurements of gus activity showed that bdcbf <dig> possesses transcriptional activation activity , indicating that it is a transcriptional activator.

the arabidopsis cbf proteins induce the expression of cor genes by directly binding to the crt motifs within the gene promoters
 <cit> . we therefore asked whether the bdcbf <dig> transcription factor binds to the promoter of cor genes. synthetic nucleotides, which cover the crt motifs in the promoters of the barley dhn <dig>  and cor14b genes and the arabidopsis cor15a gene , were analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays  using recombinant bdcbf <dig> protein, which was prepared as bdcbf1-his fusion in escherichia coli cells. the emsa assays revealed that bdcbf <dig> binds to the crt sequences . the bdcbf <dig> binding to the crt sequences was reduced in the presence of excess amounts  of unlabeled competitor dna. in addition, the bdcbf <dig> binding was significantly reduced when mutated crt sequences were used. these observations indicate that the bdcbf <dig> transcription factor binds specifically to the crt sequences in the cor gene promoters.

effects of abiotic stresses on bdcbf gene expression
monocot and dicot cbf genes are influenced by a variety of abiotic stress conditions, such as cold, drought, and high salinity
 <cit> . we found that the bdcbf <dig> protein is a bona fide transcription factor, which binds to the promoters of cold-responsive genes from arabidopsis and barley, suggesting that the bdcbf genes would be affected by abiotic stresses.

two-week-old brachypodium plants were exposed to various abiotic stress conditions, and total rna was extracted from whole plants for quantitative real-time rt-pcr  assays. gene expression analysis showed that the bdcbf <dig>  bdcbf <dig>  and bdcbf <dig> genes were markedly induced under cold temperature conditions . the cold effects were most prominent on the bdcbf <dig> gene expression with approximately 15-fold induction. the bdcbf <dig> and bdcbf <dig> genes were also induced by drought and high salinity. whereas the bdcbf <dig> gene was induced by high salinity, it was not influenced to a detectable level by drought. it is notable that the bdcbf <dig> gene is affected most prominently by high salinity among the abiotic stress conditions examined . abscisic acid , which is a major stress hormone in plants
 <cit> , did not have any discernible effects on the bdcbf gene expression, unlike the cbf gene expression patterns in arabidopsis and other plant species
 <cit> . these observations suggest that the bdcbf genes mediate both cold response and plant responses to drought and salt stress, possibly in an aba-independent manner.

stress-tolerant phenotypes of bdcbf-overexpressing brachypodium plants
based on the expression analysis of bdcbf genes under abiotic stress conditions, we postulated that the bdcbf genes are associated with plant responses to abiotic stresses.

to investigate the physiological roles of the bdcbf <dig> transcription factors, the bdcbf <dig> cdna sequence was transformed into brachypodium distachyon ecotype bd21- <dig> under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter. the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic brachypodium plants were grown under abiotic stress conditions to examine their stress responsiveness.

the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic plants were phenotypically indistinguishable from the bd21- <dig> control plants except elevated transcription levels of bdcbf <dig> gene when grown under normal conditions . in contrast, they exhibited enhanced tolerance to cold temperatures , drought, and salt stress  , which is consistent with the inductive effects of the abiotic stresses on the bdcbf gene expression. electrolyte leakage assays using the leaf blades showed that electrical conductivity was drastically reduced in the leaves of the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic plants that were treated with freezing temperatures  or high salt . these results further support the notion that the physiological roles of the bdcbf proteins are similar to those of the cbf proteins in arabidopsis and other plant species.

accumulation of proline and sugars in 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic brachypodium plants
under abiotic stress conditions, a variety of osmolytes or compatible solutes, such as proline and soluble sugars, accumulates in plant tissues and acts as osmoprotectants that protect plants from extreme osmotic changes
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, transgenic plants overexpressing cbf <dig> gene are tolerant to freezing temperatures
 <cit> . proline and sugars accumulate to a high level in the transgenic plants under both normal and cold stress conditions. since the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic brachypodium plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses, we predicted that osmolytes would accumulate in the transgenic plants.

measurements of proline contents showed that the level was higher by 30-fold in the transgenic plants in comparison to that in the bd21- <dig> control plants under normal conditions . the proline levels were further elevated in the transgenic plants when they were exposed to cold and salt stresses, which is in correlation with the enhanced stress tolerance of the transgenic plants. particularly, under cold stress conditions, whereas the proline level was elevated by 3-fold in control plants, it was elevated by approximately 95-fold in the transgenic plants, sustaining the role of bdcbf <dig> primarily in cold stress response.
 <cit> . the numbers in parentheses indicate fold changes relative to the value in the mock-treated bd21- <dig> plants. bars indicate standard error of the mean. b. sugar contents. the plant materials described in  were used for the extraction of soluble sugars. contents of individual sugars were determined by hplc, as described previously
 <cit> . mo, mock.

we found that the levels of soluble sugars, such as glucose, raffinose, and fructose, were elevated by 3 ~  <dig> times in control plants when exposed to cold and salt stresses . notably, the sugar levels were higher in the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic plants and comparable to the levels in control plants that were exposed to freezing temperatures and salt stress. it is therefore concluded that the elevated levels of osmolytes at least in part underlie the enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses in the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic brachypodium plants.

abiotic stress tolerance in bdcbf1-overexpressing arabidopsis plants
to further characterize the functional conservation of the bdcbf transcription factors in different plant species, we produced transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing the bdcbf <dig> gene under the control of the camv35s promoter. two independent transgenic lines were selected for further analysis according to the high-level expression of the transgene .

the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants did not show any discernible phenotypic changes when grown under normal conditions . however, they exhibited distinct phenotypes when exposed to stress conditions. for freezing tolerance assays, two-week-old plants grown on ½ x murashige and skoog-agar plates  were exposed to -8°c for 5 h and allowed to recover at 23°c for  <dig> days. the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to freezing temperatures . to access the degree of freezing tolerance, chlorophyll contents were measured using the rosette leaves. the levels of chlorophylls were higher by approximately 2-fold in the transgenic plants in comparison to col- <dig> plants transformed with vector alone .

to investigate drought stress tolerance in the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants, two-week-old plants grown in soil were further grown without watering for  <dig> days, when most of the transgenic plants wilted, and rewatered for  <dig> days before measuring survival rates. the survival rates were significantly higher in the transgenic plants : whereas the survival rates of the transgenic plants were ~60%, that of control plants was 12% under our assay conditions.

to examine the tolerance response of the transgenic plants under high salinity, one-week-old plants grown on ms-agar plates were transferred to fresh ms-agar plates containing 150 mm nacl and further grown for  <dig> days. the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants were clearly more tolerant to salt stress . the chlorophyll levels were approximately 70% higher in the transgenic leaves in comparison to the control leaves .

consistent with the improved tolerance to abiotic stresses in the 35s:bdcbf <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants, the transcript levels of stress response genes, such as cor15a, cor <dig>  cor <dig> /kin <dig>  and galactinol synthase  <dig> , were significantly higher in the transgenic arabidopsis plants .

together, our data demonstrate that the brachypodium bdcbf transcription factors are also functional in arabidopsis, further supporting the functional conservation of the cbf-cor cold signaling module in brachypodium.

discussion
many plant species from temperate regions have the ability to acclimate to cold, nonfreezing temperatures, which is essential for plant survival at freezing temperatures. during the cold acclimation process, diverse biochemical and physiological adjustments occur in plant cells. the cold-responsive cellular events include modifications of lipid composition in the cellular membranes and accumulation of osmoprotectants, including anti-freeze proteins, proline, and sugars
 <cit> .

cold acclimation is associated with extensive changes in the transcriptome, among which changes in the expression patterns of transcription factor genes are most prevailing
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, a central cold signaling pathway includes the cbf transcription factors that directly regulate an array of cor genes through the supposed ice1-cbf-cor regulon
 <cit> . consequently, genes constituting the cold signaling pathway and underlined molecular mechanisms have been comprehensively studied in arabidopsis <cit> .

the cbf genes have been functionally characterized using gene-deficient mutants and transgenic plants overexpressing them in several plant species
 <cit> . numerous cbf gene homologues have been identified through genomic sequence analysis in both monocots and dicots
 <cit> . accumulating evidence in recent years indicate that the cbf signaling pathways are conserved in diverse plant species.

the brachypodium genome contains more than a hundred of ap <dig> domain-containing proteins, among which  <dig> members have been identified as cbf <dig> homologues by blast searches and phylogenetic analyses
 <cit> . through similar approaches, we identified  <dig> putative bdcbf proteins that are classified into  <dig> clades. clades i and ii contain one and two bdcbf members, respectively. clade iii contains  <dig> bdcbf members, similar to what have been identified previously
 <cit> . based on the phylogenetic analyses, we selected one member that is cold responsive from each clade, and the selected bdcbf proteins  were functionally studied in cold response and other abiotic stress responses using transgenic brachypodium and arabidopsis plants.

the predicted amino acid sequences of the bdcbf <dig> proteins are highly homologous to those in other plant species, particularly to those in wheat, barley, and rice. the ap <dig> dna-binding domains of the bdcbf proteins have the highest sequence identity to those in these plant species among others. in arabidopsis, cbf <dig>  cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> bind to the crt/dre elements of cor genes. we found that the bdcbf <dig> protein binds specifically to the crt motif within the cor gene promoters from barley and arabidopsis, sustaining the functional conservation of bdcbf <dig>  and perhaps bdcbf <dig> and bdcbf <dig> as well, in brachypodium.

expression patterns of the bdcbf genes under abiotic stress conditions were quite similar to what observed in arabidopsis <cit> . the bdcbf <dig>  bdcbf <dig> and bdcbf <dig> genes were induced by cold, high salinity, and drought but with some degree of variations. one distinction was that the bdcbf genes were not influenced by aba. it has been reported that aba induces the transcription of cbf genes, leading to subsequent induction of cor genes in arabidopsis <cit> . although further studies are required to confirm the relationship between aba signaling and bdcbf gene expression, molecular mechanisms underlying the stress induction of the bdcbf genes would be somewhat different in different plant species. this distinction may be related with recent findings, in which it has been observed that the cbf proteins have both common and distinct roles in different plant species
 <cit> .

the correlation between proline accumulation and induction of low temperature tolerance has been demonstrated in maize
 <cit> . the roles of proline and soluble sugars as osmoprotectants in low temperature tolerance have also been demonstrated in arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing cbf <dig> gene
 <cit> . the gols <dig> gene, which encodes galactinol synthase catalyzing the first step of the biosynthesis of raffinose family oligosaccharides
 <cit> , was induced in the cbf3-overexpressing transgenic arabidopsis plants
 <cit> . we found that the levels of proline and soluble sugars were significantly elevated in the 35s:bdcbf transgenic brachypodium plants that exhibit enhanced stress tolerance. abiotic stress tolerance was also improved in the transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing the bdcbf genes, and cor genes, such as cor15a, cor <dig>  kin <dig>  and gols <dig> that are directly regulated by cbf transcription factors, were markedly upregulated in the transgenic arabidopsis plants
 <cit> . together with the sequence similarities and phylogenetic relationships of the bdcbf <dig>  bdcbf <dig>  and bdcbf <dig> proteins to the cbf proteins in arabidopsis and monocot plants, our data on the functional assays strongly support that the cbf proteins and associated cbf-mediated signaling pathways are conserved in brachypodium.

improvement of stress tolerance is a potential target of genetic engineering in bioenergy grass, such as switchgrass and miscanthus <cit> . based on the genetic similarity between the grass species and brachypodium, it is envisioned that the bdcbf-cor regulon would readily be applicable to the bioenergy grass species as efficient transformation systems are to be established in near future.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified three cbf gene homologues  encoding potential transcription factors in the brachypodium distachyon genome and functionally characterized the bdcbf transcription factors using bdcbf-overexpressing transgenic brachypodium and arabidopsis plants that exhibit enhanced tolerance to cold temperatures and drought and salt stresses. proline and soluble sugars accumulated to high levels in the transgenic brachypodium plants. a set of cor genes were upregulated in the transgenic arabidopsis plants. it is therefore concluded that the cbf-mediated cold signaling pathway is conserved in brachypodium.
