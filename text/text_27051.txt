BACKGROUND
the zebrafish nlz1/znf <dig> and nlz2/znf <dig> genes are closely related to the drosophila noc and elbow genes, the c. elegans tlp- <dig> gene and several mammalian genes  <cit> . together these genes make up a subclass  that is related to the sp family of zinc finger transcription factors . specifically, net family proteins share three sequence motifs  with sp family proteins. while sp family transcription factors  are sequence-specific transcription factors acting as activators or repressors depending on the cellular context  <cit> , it is unclear if net proteins play a similar role. for instance, sp proteins contain three c2h <dig> zinc fingers that bind dna, but net proteins contain only one zinc finger and this may not be sufficient to bind dna . further, the single c2h <dig> finger in net proteins is atypical and is unlikely to bind dna directly . accordingly, direct sequence-specific dna-binding has not been reported for any net family proteins. thus, while sp proteins function as transcription factors, the biochemical activity of net family proteins is unclear.

though net proteins may not bind dna directly, the available evidence points to their having a role in transcriptional regulation. for instance, elbow, tlp- <dig>  nlz <dig> and nlz <dig> are located in the nucleus  <cit>  and nlz <dig> must be nuclearly localized to be fully active  <cit> . furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that net family proteins modulate gene expression during embryogenesis. in particular, expression of spalt, a marker of the dorsal tracheal trunk in drosophila, is abolished in response to ectopic expression of elbow and is expanded in elbow mutants  <cit> . similarly, ectopic expression of nlz <dig> or nlz <dig> disrupts krox <dig> expression in rhombomere  <dig> of the zebrafish hindbrain and leads to an expansion of hoxb1a expression from rhombomere  <dig>  disruption of nlz function has the opposite effect, leading to loss of hoxb1a expression and expansion of krox <dig> expression  <cit> .

while net proteins appear likely to regulate transcription, it is unclear if they function as activators or repressors or both, as is the case for sp-family proteins. drosophila elbow is reported to interact with the transcriptional repressor groucho  <cit>  and both nlz <dig> and nlz <dig> interact with groucho as well as with several histone deacetylase  co-repressors  <cit> . against this background, we have hypothesized that net family proteins act as repressors of transcription during embryogenesis  <cit> , but there is no direct evidence for net family proteins repressing transcription and it remains plausible that they can function as both activators and repressors.

here we demonstrate that nlz proteins repress transcription both in cell lines and in developing zebrafish embryos. we first use standard cell culture-based reporter assays to demonstrate that nlz <dig> represses transcription of a luciferase reporter in four different cell lines. we find that this repression requires a domain of nlz <dig> that includes the hdac binding site and that it is blocked by the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a, indicating that nlz1-mediated repression requires hdacs. next, we generate a stable transgenic zebrafish reporter line and use it to demonstrate that nlz <dig> represses a luciferase reporter in the developing embryo. by adapting chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to zebrafish embryos, we further demonstrate that this repression is accompanied by histone deacetylation at the transgene promoter, again consistent with nlz-mediated repression requiring hdacs. lastly, we take a genetic approach to examine the function of endogenous nlz proteins. we find that nlz proteins are required for formation of hindbrain rhombomere  <dig> because they repress expression of non-rhombomere  <dig> genes. we do not find any evidence for nlz proteins being required as activator during hindbrain formation. we conclude that nlz proteins act as repressors of transcription and hypothesize that other net family members function in a similar manner.

methods
plasmids
the uas-sv40:luciferase plasmid was generated by inserting oligonucleotides containing three uas sites upstream of the sv <dig> promoter in the pgl <dig> plasmid . all nlz1-gal4dbd fusion constructs were myc-tagged at the n-teminus and generated by pcr amplifying the appropriate regions of nlz <dig> and subcloning them upstream of the gal4dbd domain in the pcs2mt expression vector.

cell culture, transfection and reporter assay
hela, nih3t <dig> and sn <dig> cells were maintained in dmem containing 10% fbs at 37°c and zf <dig> cells were maintained in 1: <dig> dmem/f <dig> with 10% fbs at 28°c. for transfections,  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells were plated in a single well of 6-well plates. the fugene <dig>  system was used for transfection of hela, nih3t <dig> and sn <dig> cells and effectene  for transfection of zf <dig> cells. luciferase reporter plasmid  was co-transfected with β-galactosidase plasmid  and  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng or  <dig> ng of gal4dbd or nlz1-gal4dbd expression vector . the corresponding empty vector was used to adjust the total amount of dna to  <dig>  μg per well . for tsa experiments, transfected cells were treated with dmso,  <dig>  μm or  <dig>  μm tsa starting  <dig> hrs after transfection. cells were harvested  <dig> hrs after transfection. cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities followed by normalization of luciferase activity based on β-galactosidase activity.

western blotting
samples were separated on  <dig> % sds page and transferred to a pvdf membrane. the membrane was incubated in tbs-t blocking buffer  for one hour, then with  <dig> μg/ml anti-myc antibody in tbs-t 1% bsa at 4°c o/n with gentle shaking. the membrane was then washed with tbs-t, incubated with 1: <dig> anti-mouse hrt antibody in 5% skim milk for one hour with gentle agitation, washed again with tbs-t and developed with supersignal ultra reagent .

generation of transgenic uas-sv40:luciferase reporter line
the uas-sv40:luciferase vector was linearized with noti. dna  was injected into embryos at the 1-cell stage. injected embryos were raised to adulthood  and out-crossed to wild type fish. embryos from each cross were pooled and assayed by pcr  for presence of the transgene. f <dig> carriers were then out-crossed and the offspring raised to adulthood . f <dig> fish were genotyped by pcr of fin clip biopsies. confirmed f <dig> carriers were used to produce embryos for reporter experiments.

promoter assay using tg embryos
f <dig> tg heterozygous carriers were out crossed and the f <dig> embryos injected with  <dig> pg mrna encoding gal4dbd or nlz1-gal4dbd at the 2– <dig> cell stage. injected embryos were raised 11– <dig> hours  and homogenized in  <dig> μl luciferase lysis buffer . each sample was centrifuged and  <dig> μl of supernatant was used for luciferase assays . injection of equivalent amounts of mrna was confirmed by quantitative pcr.

chromatin immunoprecipitation
chips were performed as described previously  <cit>  with modifications to allow dissociation of zebrafish embryos into single cells. specifically,  <dig> zebrafish embryos were collected at 16hpf, dechorionated and incubated with  <dig> units of collagenase  in pbs for  <dig> minutes at 37°c prior to cross-linking.  <dig> μl anti-acetyl histone h <dig> antibody  was used for the chip. the purified dna was dissolved in  <dig> μl tris-edta and  <dig> μl was used for quantitative pcr. 1% of chromatin taken before immunoprecipitation was used as input. quantitative pcr was performed with  <dig>  μl of quantitect sybr green pcr mix ,  <dig>  μl of dh2o and  <dig> μl of dna with  <dig>  μm of the primers . pcr amplification was detected and normalized as a ratio to the input for each sample by using a dna engine opticon .

zebrafish lines and in situ hybridization
vhnf1hi <dig> mutants were obtained from n. hopkins  <cit> . nlz loss-of-function embryos were prepared by microinjecting anti-sense morpholino oligos targeting nlz <dig> and nlz <dig> as reported previously  <cit> . the whole-mount in situ hybridization protocol and probes were described previously  <cit> .

RESULTS
nlz <dig> represses transcription in a diverse set of cell lines
to determine if nlz <dig> acts as a repressor of transcription, we first turned to a cell culture-based reporter assay. since nlz <dig> is unlikely to bind dna directly, we generated a fusion protein where the dna-binding domain  from the yeast gal <dig> protein is fused in-frame to the c-terminus of full-length nlz <dig>  western blotting experiments demonstrate that the resulting nlz1-gal4dbd protein is well expressed in hela cells . transcription activity was measured using a reporter plasmid  containing  <dig> gal <dig> binding sites  in front of the sv <dig> promoter driving luciferase expression . transfection of the reporter plasmid alone produces robust luciferase expression in hela cells. co-transfection of the gal4dbd produces a small, but reproducible increase in luciferase activity , suggesting that the gal4dbd has weak activator activity. in contrast, co-transfection of the nlz1-gal4dbd fusion protein produces a dose-dependent reduction in luciferase levels . while the extent of this repression varies slightly between experiments, we routinely observe up to a 10– <dig> fold repression . this repression requires recruitment of nlz <dig> to dna, since nlz <dig> lacking the gal4dbd domain does not repress luciferase expression in this assay . analyses of nlz1-gal4dbd function in zf <dig> , sn <dig>  and nih3t <dig>  cell lines also demonstrate robust repression of luciferase activity . we conclude that nlz <dig> has the ability to repress transcription in cell lines derived from different tissues and various organisms.

the hdac binding domain in nlz <dig> is required for repression
we have previously demonstrated that nlz proteins bind hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> histone deacetylases  <cit>  and hela cells are known to express hdacs. hence, we next used our previous structure-function data to begin testing whether nlz <dig> utilizes hdacs to repress transcription in hela cells. specifically, the domain of nlz <dig> required for hdac binding appears to reside between the 'buttonhead box'  and the c2h <dig> zinc finger , although the buttonhead box may also be required for optimal binding .

to test which domains of nlz <dig> are required for repression in the reporter assay, we fused a series of nlz <dig> deletion constructs to the gal4dbd . western blotting experiments demonstrate that all constructs are well expressed upon transfection into hela cells . additionally, the gal4dbd contains a nuclear localization signal ensuring that all fusion proteins localize to the nucleus . we next examined each of the deletion constructs for its ability to repress the uas-sv40:luciferase reporter in hela cells . as expected, we find that intact nlz1-gal4dbd represses luciferase expression in a robust, dose-dependent manner. further, deleting the buttonhead box  has a minimal effect on hdac binding  and this construct retains repressor activity . in contrast, nlz <dig> constructs lacking the hdac-interaction domain  repress the reporter only weakly . together these results demonstrate that the hdac-interaction domain is required for optimal activity of nlz <dig> and are consistent with nlz <dig> recruiting hdacs to repress transcription. however, we note some residual repressor activity  in the two constructs that do not bind hdacs  suggesting that nlz <dig> may also repress transcription by a hdac-independent mechanism.

nlz family proteins share an n-terminal sequence motif  with sp-family proteins . while the function of this domain is not fully understood, it has been implicated in regulating the transcription activity of sp <dig>  <cit> . further, although this motif is not involved in binding to co-repressors, we have shown that it is required for nlz <dig> function in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . we therefore tested a construct lacking the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids, including the sp motif, in the reporter assay. we find that Δn115nlz1-gal4dbd has robust repressor activity , indicating that this domain is not required for nlz1-mediated repression in hela cells .

nlz1-mediated repression is sensitive to trichostatin a
to further test whether nlz1-mediated repression requires hdac activity, we made use of trichostatin a , an inhibitor of hdac activity  <cit> . for these experiments hela cells were transfected with the uas-sv40:luciferase reporter together with nlz1-gal4dbd, Δ385–460nlz1-gal4dbd or gal4dbd and treated with various concentration of tsa . in the absence of tsa, the nlz1-gal4dbd construct represses luciferase expression ~ <dig> fold, similar to the results in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  however, addition of tsa revealed a dose dependent block of this repression such that at  <dig>  μm tsa, we observed only 6– <dig> fold repression. we were unable to test higher concentrations of tsa since treatment with higher doses was toxic to the cells. however, higher tsa doses may not completely block nlz1-mediated repression. in particular, the Δ385–460nlz1-gal4dbd construct that cannot bind hdacs repressed ~5-fold in both the presence and absence of tsa. hence, we conclude that hdac activity is required for optimal nlz-mediated repression, but our results again suggest an hdac-independent component of nlz1-mediated repression.

nlz <dig> represses a uas-sv40:luciferase transgene in zebrafish embryos
we next set out to test whether nlz <dig> acts as a repressor also in zebrafish embryos. to this end, we first generated a stable uas-sv40:luciferase transgenic reporter line. two transgenic carriers were identified  and we find that embryo lysates from all id1-derived animals display robust luciferase activity . the similar luciferase expression levels are consistent with all id1-derived animals containing the same transgene integration event, although this conclusion awaits final confirmation. we refer to this line as tg. in contrast, id2-derived animals do not express luciferase, suggesting that the transgene is not active in this line, perhaps as a result of silencing at the integration site.

we next used f <dig> tg embryos to test whether nlz <dig> acts as a repressor in vivo . we find that injection of nlz1-gal4dbd mrna reproducibly represses luciferase activity about  <dig> -fold compared to un-injected transgenic embryos. control injections of gal4dbd mrna does not repress expression from the tg transgene – instead gal4dbd leads to ~2-fold activation, similar to the weak activation by gal4dbd in our cell-based reporter assays . we also used chromatin immunoprecipitation  to determine whether repression of the luciferase transgene is accompanied by reduced histone acetylation at the transgenic promoter . we find that histone h <dig> is deacetylated at the transgenic promoter in embryos expressing nlz1-gal4dbd relative to control embryos. in agreement with the apparent ability of the gal4dbd control construct to activate expression of the luciferase reporter, we observe increased histone h <dig> acetylation at the transgenic promoter in embryos expressing the gal4dbd construct. it is possible that higher doses of nlz1-gal4dbd mrna would lead to further histone deacetylation and repression, but we have been unable to test this possibility since we find that higher concentrations of mrna are toxic to zebrafish embryos. nevertheless, our results demonstrate that nlz <dig> can repress transcription and promote histone deacetylation in zebrafish embryos.

nlz proteins are required for rhombomere-restricted expression of gbx <dig> and vhnf1
to further explore if nlz proteins act as repressors in vivo, we next turned to nlz loss-of-function  embryos. during early embryogenesis, the vertebrate hindbrain is transformed from an immature and relatively uniform structure into a structure that is subdivided into a series of rhombomere segments . nlz <dig> and nlz <dig> proteins are required in this process  <cit> , but the effect of disrupting nlz function  has only been assayed for two genes. specifically, loss of nlz function leads to expansion of krox <dig> expression from rhombomere  <dig>  and r <dig> into r <dig> and loss of hoxb1a expression in r <dig>  <cit> . notably, there are genes acting earlier than krox <dig> in r <dig> and r <dig>  in particular, the vhnf <dig> transcription factor is reported to be the earliest-acting gene in the formation of r <dig> and more posterior rhombomeres , while the gbx <dig> transcription factor acts early in more anterior rhombomeres . thus, we examined vhnf <dig> and gbx <dig> expression in nlz-embryos. as expected, simultaneous detection of vhnf <dig> and gbx <dig> expression by whole mount in situ hybridization reveals a gap corresponding to r <dig> in wild type embryos . in contrast, nlz- embryos lack such a gap . specifically, the gbx <dig> expression domain expands and low-level gbx <dig> expression appears caudally in nlz- embryos . the vhnf <dig> expression domain also appears to expand as revealed by a reduced gap between vhnf <dig> expression in r5/r <dig> and pax <dig> expression at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary , as well as between vhnf <dig> expression in r5/r <dig> and krox <dig> expression in r <dig> . these findings demonstrate that nlz proteins are required to repress expression of vhnf <dig> and gbx <dig> in r <dig>  but do not reveal whether this effect is direct or indirect.

nlz proteins act as repressors in r4
our results suggest that nlz proteins are required to repress expression of vhnf <dig> and gbx <dig> in r <dig>  failure to repress these genes could account for the reported loss of hoxb1a expression in r <dig> of nlz- embryos. in particular, vhnf <dig> is known to repress hoxb1a expression  <cit>  and expression of vhnf <dig> in r <dig> of nlz- embryos might therefore suppress hoxb1a expression.

we took a genetic approach to determine if nlz proteins are required in r <dig> because they repress vhnf <dig> expression. in particular, if hoxb1a expression in r <dig> requires that nlz proteins repress expression of vhnf <dig>  then removing vhnf <dig> function on a nlz loss-of-function background might restore hoxb1a expression. put more generally, if expression of hoxb1a requires repression of a repressor, then removing both repressors should restore hoxb1a expression. as reported, hoxb1a expression is lost in nlz- embryos  by the  <dig> somite stage. strikingly, we find that hoxb1a expression is robustly restored when vhnf <dig> function is removed on the nlz- background . we also note the same behavior for fgf <dig> expression, as fgf <dig> expression is lost in r <dig> of nlz- embryos  and restored to nlz-/vhnf1- embryos . thus, when vhnf <dig> is missing, nlz proteins are not required for hoxb1a or fgf <dig> expression – consistent with nlz proteins acting to repress vhnf <dig> expression. this finding also excludes the possibility that nlz proteins are required to activate hoxb1a or fgf <dig> expression in r <dig>  notably, since vhnf <dig> function is lacking in r5/r <dig> of nlz-/vhnf1- embryos, krox <dig> expression is lost from r <dig> and r <dig> expression extends into r5/r <dig> in these embryos, as also observed in vhnf1- embryos . lastly, nlz-/vhnf1- embryos display expanded r <dig> krox <dig> expression, perhaps as a result of a failure to repress gbx <dig> expression. in summary, our genetic analysis supports a role for nlz proteins in repressing expression of non-r <dig> genes.

rhombomere  <dig> has been postulated as an important signaling center required for segmentation of the hindbrain  <cit> . yet, while nlz- embryos lack r <dig>  the adjacent r <dig> and r <dig> territories appear relatively intact . we therefore examined earlier stage embryos and find that hoxb1a is robustly expressed in nlz- embryos at the tailbud stage . similarly, although fgf <dig> expression is weak in tailbud stage embryos, we routinely observe fgf <dig> expression in the region corresponding to r <dig> of nlz- embryos . thus, r <dig> gene expression appears to be initiated in nlz- embryos, further supporting our hypothesis that nlz proteins are not required to induce gene expression in r <dig>  but to repress expression of non-r <dig> genes.

discussion
based on their sequence relationship to sp transcription factors and their roles during embryonic development, nlz proteins and other net family members have been postulated to regulate transcription. in particular, nlz proteins share several domains, including a c2h <dig> zinc finger, with sp transcription factors and nlz proteins localize to the nucleus. additionally, mis-expression of nlz <dig> or nlz <dig> blocks expression of krox <dig> in rhombomere  <dig> of the zebrafish hindbrain and permits expansion of r <dig> gene expression  <cit> . conversely, disruption of nlz function leads to expansion of krox <dig> expression accompanied by loss of hoxb1a expression, albeit to various degrees  <cit> . here we use a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to demonstrate that nlz proteins function as repressors, at least in part by recruiting hdacs, and that they act to repress non-r <dig> genes during zebrafish hindbrain development.

biochemical activity of nlz proteins
our results demonstrate that nlz proteins repress transcription of a luciferase reporter gene both in cell lines and in zebrafish embryos. our structure-function analysis revealed that nlz proteins require a region containing the hdac interaction domain for optimal repression activity. in addition, nlz1-mediated repression in cell lines is blocked by the hdac antagonist trichostatin a  and nlz <dig> expression promotes histone deacetylation at a transgenic promoter in zebrafish embryos. these findings suggest that nlz proteins repress transcription by recruiting hdacs to target promoters. notably, hdacs are broadly expressed in zebrafish embryos  <cit> , suggesting that they are available for nlz-mediated repression. our results also indicate that nlz proteins may repress transcription partly by an hdac-independent mechanism. specifically, we observe residual repressor activity for nlz constructs that cannot bind hdacs and nlz <dig> retains some repressor activity even in the presence of tsa. although we do not presently know how this residual repressor effect is mediated, our finding that nlz proteins repress transcription by recruiting hdacs represents an important advance in the understanding of nlz function.

we have noted that net family proteins are unlikely to bind dna directly. these proteins may therefore need to be recruited to dna by other dna binding factors, but it is presently unclear how this may be achieved. a potential clue may be provided by our structure-function analysis, which revealed that the n-terminal sp domain  is not required for nlz-mediated repression in cell lines. this is in contrast to our previous analysis in zebrafish embryos, where we found that the sp domain is required for optimal nlz <dig> function  <cit> . we note that these analyses differ such that our current report utilizes a nlz1-gal4dbd fusion protein – where nlz <dig> is recruited to dna via the gal <dig> dna binding domain – whereas our previous work utilized wild type nlz <dig>  hence, it is possible that the sp domain acts as a binding site for a protein that recruits nlz <dig> to target promoters in the embryo, although this possibility awaits confirmation by the identification of proteins that bind the sp motif. the role of this motif in sp protein function is not clear and it has been ascribed several potential functions , but there are reports that the sp motif acts as a protein interaction site  <cit> .

lastly, while we have not detected any evidence that nlz proteins can activate transcription, we cannot exclude the possibility that nlz proteins function as activators in specific cellular contexts. indeed, some sp proteins are thought to function as activators or repressors depending on the availability of cofactors . since such an activator function might be obscured by the high basal activity of the sv <dig> promoter in our reporter construct, we have tested if nlz1-gal4dbd can activate transcription from a reporter construct containing a minimal β-globin promoter, but we have not observed activation of transcription .

biological role of nlz proteins
disruption of nlz function leads to loss of hoxb1a expression in r <dig> and expansion of krox <dig> expression from r <dig> and r <dig> of the hindbrain. while hoxb1a is one of the earliest-acting genes in r <dig>  there are several genes acting earlier than krox <dig> in r <dig> and r <dig>  in particular, vhnf <dig> is reported to act very early in the formation of r <dig> and to be required for krox <dig> expression in r <dig>  <cit> , while gbx <dig> acts early in r1-r <dig>  <cit> . hence, we examined expression of vhnf <dig> and gbx <dig> in nlz loss-of-function embryos and found that expression of these genes expands into r <dig> – indicating that gbx <dig> and vhnf <dig> expression is normally repressed in r <dig> by nlz proteins. since vhnf <dig> represses hoxb1a expression  <cit> , we postulated that nlz proteins might function to repress vhnf <dig> expression in r <dig> – thereby preventing vhnf1-mediated repression of hoxb1a expression. in support of this hypothesis we find that removing vhnf <dig> function on a nlz loss-of-function background restores hoxb1a expression, indicating that nlz proteins are required to repress vhnf <dig> expression in cells that will form r <dig>  at present, we do not know if this repression is direct  or if there are additional intervening steps. this issue is complicated by the fact that nlz proteins may need to be recruited to target promoters by as yet unknown dna binding proteins , further underscoring that an important next step will be to identify nlz-binding proteins. we also note that gbx <dig> expression expands throughout the caudal embryo in the absence of nlz function. this indicates that nlz may repress gene expression also outside r <dig>  consistent with the broad expression of nlz genes at early stages of development.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that nlz <dig> represses transcription of a luciferase reporter in four different cell lines and that this repression requires hdacs. we generate a transgenic zebrafish reporter line and demonstrate that nlz <dig> represses transcription and promotes histone deacetylation at the transgene promoter in developing embryos, consistent with nlz1-mediated repression requiring hdacs also in vivo. lastly, we take a genetic approach to demonstrate that nlz proteins are required as repressors, but not activators, of transcription in formation of hindbrain rhombomere  <dig> during zebrafish embryogenesis. we conclude that nlz proteins act as repressors of transcription and hypothesize that other net family members function in a similar manner. our results also demonstrate the utility of stable transgenic zebrafish-based reporter assays as a complement to cell culture-based reporter assays.
