BACKGROUND
chilling temperature significantly affects the early growth of winter wheat plants causing considerable reduction of grain yield and is one of the major factors limiting growth and productivity of crops  <cit> . cold induced photosynthesis inhibition results in a complex array of reactive oxygen species  generation, especially in chloroplasts  <cit> . over-accumulation of ros may cause rigidification and leakage of the cell membrane, and destabilization of protein complexes  <cit> . recent proteomic studies have revealed differential expression of proteins in wheat exposed to cold stress  <cit> . among the down-regulated proteins due to cold stress, some key enzymes involved in krebs cycle  have been identified, together with many photosynthesis-related proteins   <cit> . proteomic analysis of spring freezing stress responsive proteins in leaves revealed an increased accumulation of stress defense proteins, including lea-related cor protein, cu/zn superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidases, which may play crucial roles in enhancing tolerance to spring freeze stress in bread wheat  <cit> . in addition, proteomic analysis of wheat in response to prolonged cold stress showed reinforcement in expressions of enzymes involving in ascorbate recycling  and involving in tetrapyrrole re-synthesis   <cit> .

mechanical wounding can be caused by surrounding environmental factors, such as wind, rainstorms, and herbivores, and it has broad impacts on plants, including changes in morphogenetic characteristics, membrane potential  <cit> , ros, hormone signaling and gene expression  <cit> . several alterations induced by mechanical wounding can allow plants to resist and acclimate to environmental stresses  <cit> . as previously observed in maize, bean, and rice, denser but smaller stomata in mechanically stimulated leaves could help plants to control transpirational water loss, thereby avoiding drought stress  <cit> . mechano-stimulation was reported to increase cold tolerance in beans, tomato, and maize through maintenance of higher photosystem ii  efficiency and accumulation of higher levels of soluble sugars  <cit> . it was also suggested that similar defense mechanisms are operated in cold acclimation and mechano-stimulation, resulting in similar morphological and developmental changes  <cit> . recently, analysis of transcript profiles indicated various defense response genes were induced by mechano-stimulation, and were related to cold stress response, including general stress response , rapid stress response , and rapid wound response   <cit> . in addition, it has been proposed that mechanical disruption of the cell wall may induce stress signaling  <cit> . cold stress is perceived by the plant through detection of changes in membrane fluidity and protein conformation. secondary messengers such as ca2+ and ros are implicated in the initial signaling cascades in response to cold stress  <cit> .

many studies reported changes in ros levels following mechano-stimulation  <cit> . for instance, mechano-stimulation induced a significant increase in ros levels in mesembryanthemum crystallinum leaves  <cit> . furthermore, proteomic studies have shown that plants transiently produce superoxide and h2o <dig>  which might play critical roles in signal transduction during early wound response  <cit> . mechano-stimulation induced increased expression of cytosolic h2o2-detoxifying enzyme, ascorbate peroxidase  <dig>   <cit> . this increase in apx <dig> was independent of other mechanical wounding signals such as jasmonic acid  or abscisic acid   <cit> . it has also been suggested that nadph-dependent h2o <dig> signals contribute to the activation of specific mechano-stimulated signals which are not activated by the ja or aba  <cit> . the cellular steady-state level of ros is tightly regulated by a complex network involving ca2+, protein phosphorylation, and ros-scavenging/producing enzymes during wound response  <cit> . in addition, mechanical wounding has been found to induce a burst of superoxide and apoplastic peroxidase with both oxidative and peroxidative activities  <cit> .

in this study, mechano-stimulation was applied to two contrasting winter wheat cultivars that differed in cold tolerance at different growth stages in order to investigate the effects of mechano-stimulation on the performance of the chloroplastic antioxidant system and changes of the proteome under late spring low temperature stress. the results obtained in this study may provide deeper insights into the roles of mechano-stimulated modifications within chloroplast antioxidant systems and proteome in cold tolerance in wheat. this information will be helpful for exploring novel approaches to mitigate the impacts of low temperatures which occur during critical developmental stages in wheat plants.

the increase in leaf fluorescence transients observed in cc treatment showed a typical ojip shape in yn <dig> and lm <dig> . however, p1l , p2l,  and cl  showed repressed fluorescence transients in these two cultivars, particularly at step i  and p. the main changes of fluorescence data were normalized between step i  and p  and presented as relative variable fluorescence wip . obvious changes in wip during the fast rise period were observed under p2l and cl in yn <dig>  while under p1l, p2l, and cl in lm <dig>  compared with cc. wop  and woi  showed relatively variable fluorescence from o to step p  and from o to i . a significant decrease in wop at step i was found in p1l, p2l, and cl in yn <dig>  while wop was increased remarkably by p2l at step i in lm <dig>  significant changes in woi were found among p1l, p2l, and cl treatments in yn <dig>  which were related to the reductions between psi and reduced nadp+. however, with the exception of the p2l treatment, woi was only slightly affected in lm <dig> fig.  <dig> effects of mechano-stimulation on chlorophyll a fluorescence transient of dark adapted leaves  in winter wheat exposed to cold stress at jointing.  fluorescence intensity on logarithmic time scale; b & d wip = /, ratio of variable fluorescence ft-fi to the amplitude fp-fi;  wop = /, ratio of variable fluorescence ft-fo to the amplitude fp-fo;  woi = /, ratio of variable fluorescence ft-fo to the amplitude fi-fo




rubisco activities and activation
initial and total rubisco activities and rubisco activation in the latest fully expanded leaves were significantly decreased with cl, compared with cc in yn <dig> and lm <dig> . both traits were slightly and marginally significantly increased by p1l , whereas they were depressed by p2l compared with cl . rubisco activation in p1l was relatively higher than in cl, but was still lower than in cc for both cultivars . in addition, no difference in rubisco activation was found between p2l and cl.fig.  <dig> effects of mechano-stimulation on initial and total rubisco activities and activation in the latest fully expanded leaves in winter wheat exposed to cold stress at jointing



ros production, activities of antioxidant enzymes, and expressions of their encoding genes in chloroplasts
in yn <dig>  cl increased the concentration of h2o <dig> in chloroplasts in the latest fully expanded leaves by  <dig> % as compared with cc, whereas p2l showed a  <dig> % increment compared with cl . however, no difference was observed between cc and p1l. a similar pattern was observed in lm <dig>  the highest rate of o2− release was found in p2l, followed by cl and p1l, whereas that in cc was lowest in both cultivars . sod activity in chloroplasts was increased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % with p1l in yn <dig> and lm <dig>  respectively. compared with cc, p1l increased while p2l and cl significantly decreased chloroplastic sod activity in the two cultivars . in addition, in both cultivars, expression of cu/zn sod was up-regulated by p1l compared with cl , whereas an up-regulation of fe sod due to p1l was only observed in yn <dig> . for both cultivars, cat activity was lower in cl than in cc, whereas it was higher in p1l than in cl . in lm <dig>  p2l decreased cat activity by  <dig> % compared with cl, whereas no significant difference was found in yn <dig> . an increase in the expression of cat was found in p1l and p2l compared with cl in yn19; however, the difference was not statistically significant . in both cultivars, the combination of mechano-stimulation and low temperature  and cl enhanced apx activity compared with cc. in particular apx activity in p2l was significantly higher than in cl . further, the same trend was found in thylakoid-bound apx  expressions in yn <dig>  whereas in lm <dig>  a significant up-regulation of tapx was only observed in p1l . in both cultivars, gpx activity was enhanced with p1l, but depressed with p2l and cl  . in both cultivars, p1l and cl resulted in a significant increase in gpx activity, compared with cc , whereas p2l slightly increased gpx activity . low temperature significantly enhanced dhar activity in both cultivars ; however, p1l and p2l had opposite effects on dhar activity in the two cultivars—namely, p2l decreased dhar activity compared to cl in yn <dig>  but increased activity in lm6; p1l increased dhar activity in lm <dig>  whereas no difference between p1l and cl was found in yn <dig> . thus, p1l and p2l showed opposite patterns in the concentration of h2o <dig> in chloroplasts, o2− release rate and most of the antioxidant enzyme activities, but the apx activity showed a similar trend in p1l and p2l.fig.  <dig> effects of mechano-stimulation on reactive oxygen species and antioxidant enzyme system in chloroplasts in the latest fully expanded leaves in winter wheat exposed to cold stress at jointing. a h2o <dig>  hydrogen peroxide; b o2

discussion
it is well known that ros production is a universal response to mechanical wounding in various plants  <cit> . the defense system can also be activated to alleviate ros-induced oxidative stress and repair the damaged tissues  <cit> . furthermore, many of the genes encoding enzymes involved in ros metabolism are regulated by mechanical wounding  <cit> . here, the leaf chloroplastic h2o <dig> concentration in p1l plants was very close to that in cc plants. in contrast, p2l plants have a significantly higher h2o <dig> concentration than cc plants . this difference is related to the efficient ros scavenging capacity of the antioxidant enzyme systems, particularly the water-water cycle in chloroplasts, which mainly includes sod and apx  <cit> . the scavenging capacity of sod and cat activated by the mechano-stimulation in p1l had a significant inhibitory effect on the oxidative burst under low temperature stress. further analysis revealed that the enhanced activities of sod and cat could be largely explained by the up-regulated expression of cu/zn sod, fe sod, and cat in p1l . wound-induced activation of h2o2-detoxifying enzymes has previously been demonstrated using proteomic tools  <cit> . our proteome analysis showed that the expression levels of ascorbate peroxidase and catalase- <dig> were paralleled by the activities of apx and cat, respectively, under different treatments . however, in yn <dig>  the activity of apx in p1l was decreased compared to cl, whereas no significant difference was found in lm <dig>  the qpcr analysis also showed that the tapx expression was only slightly affected by p1l in yn <dig>  but it was increased by p1l in lm <dig>  apx activity under the combination of mechano-stimulation and cold stress was only partly consistent with that previously reported. it has been reported that expression of ascorbate peroxidase  <dig>  is involved in modulation of cellular h2o <dig> levels in response to wounding  <cit> . the increase in apx activity in p2l and no increase in p1l suggested that apx may not play vitally important roles in the mechano-induced cold tolerance in wheat.

increasing evidence supports the multi-signaling functions of h2o <dig> in response to abiotic stresses in higher plants  <cit> . here, under low temperature, for both texted cultivars the h2o <dig> concentration in p1l was very close to the normal level in cc. however, the release rate of o2− in p1l was significantly higher than in cc. it was suggested that activated antioxidative enzymes, such as sod and cat induced by mechano-stimulation, modify the h2o <dig> concentration to an appropriate level as a signal molecule, which prevents h2o2-induced damage to plant tissues  <cit> . in addition, modified gpx and gr activities have also been shown to be related to the down-regulation of h2o <dig> levels in chloroplasts  <cit> . here, the increased activities of gpx and gr did favour the relatively low level of h2o <dig> in p1l . although the concentrations of asa and gsh are only in the millimolar range in plant tissues, the asa-gsh cycle plays a very important role in neutralizing h2o <dig> released by disproportionation of o2−  <cit> . as key members in the asa-gsh cycle, the altered expression of glutathione reductase - and dehydroascorbate reductase -related proteins were found via proteome analysis in the present study; chloroplastic gr was increased in p1l in both cultivars, whereas dhar was enhanced in p1l only in lm <dig> compared to cl . the changes in expression of these enzymes are in accordance with their activities in chloroplasts. thus, we suggest that the asa-gsh cycle is involved in mechano-stimulated cold tolerance in winter wheat.

hardening with a previous abiotic stress endows plant with higher tolerance to recurring stresses  <cit> . for example, pre-anthesis heat hardening  can partially protect wheat plants from photosynthetic inhibition and oxidative damage under post-anthesis high-temperature stress, which is attributed to the modified expressions of photosynthesis-responsive and antioxidant enzyme-related genes  <cit> . furthermore, many studies have shown that the mechanism underlying hardening includes the accumulation of soluble sugars, reduction of photosynthetic apparatus  <cit> , scavenging of reactive oxygen species   <cit> , accumulation of osmoprotective proteins   <cit> , and other compatible solutes such as proline and betaína  <cit> . it is well known that cold acclimation reduces frost damage, and that this phenomenon involves a mechanism similar to that of drought acclimation  <cit> . mechano-stimulation may induce many types of cold response proteins and genes  <cit> . in addition to the antioxidant system activated by mechano-stimulation, shown in the present study, many types of proteins related to photosynthesis, energy production, and c metabolism were modified by mechano-stimulation . with respect to photosynthetic c assimilation, ribulose- <dig>  5-biophosphate carboxylase activase and its isoform  <dig> had a higher level of expression in p1l, but a relatively low level in cl, in the two tested cultivars. ribulose- <dig>  5-biophosphate carboxylase activase and rubisco large subunit-binding protein have been shown to play a critical role in the activation of rubisco  <cit> . carbonic anhydrase enhances the co <dig> concentration in chloroplasts, which improves the carboxylation rate of rubisco enzyme  <cit> . our proteomic data also showed a higher abundance of rubisco large subunit-binding protein subunit α in p1l than that in cl in both cultivars. this implies increases in the rubisco activation state and carboxylation rate induced in the early mechano-stimulated plants under low temperature stress . the unaltered expression of ferredoxin-nadp oxidoreductase and down-regulation of ferredoxin-nadp reductase, leaf isozyme, and chloroplastic-like protein in p1l observed in the present study, resulted in an increased level of nadph-dependent h2o <dig> as compared with cl. it has been suggested that increased nadph-dependent h2o <dig> is required for the activation of systemic wound responses  <cit> . the mechano-stimulation induced h2o <dig> production is also involved in plant defence responses against invading pathogens  <cit> . it was reported that ros can control ca2+-permeable channel activity to regulate the intracellular ca2+ level  <cit> . the changes of ros and ca2+ following mechano-stimuli were implicated in the induction of defense genes in response to fungal pathogens  <cit> .

photosynthetic electron transport generates energy  and reducing power  to support carbon reduction and photorespiratory carbon oxidation in the dark reaction in photosynthesis and plays a key role in the maintenance of optimum photosynthetic rate and ensuring effective energy flow for growth  <cit> . to further investigate the interactive effects of mechano-stimulation and cold stress on the process of photosynthetic electron transport, transient fluorescence kinetics were analysed . the i-p phase of the transient fluorescence kinetics revealed changes in the electron flux from pqh <dig> to the final electron acceptor and the size of the final electron acceptor pool of ps i  <cit> . the present study showed no significant effects of the combination of mechano-stimulation and cold stress on the electron flux from pqh <dig> to the final electron acceptor. however, the o-i part of the kinetics was affected by cold stress and mechano-stimulation, which reveals changes in the process involving exciton capture to pq reduction  <cit> . in addition, the rise in fluorescence transient from o to p was faster in p2l in lm <dig>  which indicates that the re-oxidation of qa− was inhibited by the combination of cold and later mechano-stimulation  <cit> . however, it was not markedly affected by cold stress alone. the atpases in chloroplasts, mg2+-atpase and ca2+-atpase, play a key role in atp formation  <cit> . in this study, the activities of these two functional enzymes in chloroplasts were enhanced by mechano-stimulation in response to cold stress, which might favor the atp formation. consistently, the proteome data showed that, in both cultivars tested, there was a higher abundance of atp synthase β subunit in p1l.

CONCLUSIONS
early mechano-stimulation at the stage of at zadoks growth stage  <dig> activated the antioxidant system and hence maintained the balance of reactive oxygen species, improved the electron transport and photosynthesis rate under cold stress applied at the jointing stage, whereas mechano-stimulation applied 6 days before the cold event induced an opposite effect, except for apx activity and atpase activities in chloroplasts. proteomic and transcriptional analysis revealed that the oxidative stress defense, atp synthesis, and photosynthesis-related proteins and genes are up-regulated by the mechano-stimulation, which were involved in the responses of wheat plants to the cold stress.
