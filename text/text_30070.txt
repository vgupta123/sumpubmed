BACKGROUND
the vertebrate mitochondrial genome typically codes for  <dig> genes, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> transfer rnas  and two ribosomal rnas . these genes are arranged on a highly compact circular genome . the order of the genes was initially considered conserved among vertebrates. however, with more than  <dig> complete mitochondrial dna  sequences currently determined, mtdna gene rearrangements have been found in several groups, including birds , reptiles  <cit> , amphibians  <cit>  and fishes .

gene rearrangements in animal mtdna can be explained using four available models.  the recombination model, which is characterized by the breakage and rejoining of the participating dna strands  <cit> , has been used to account for changes in the mitochondrial gene order in frogs, birds, mussels and other organisms .  another commonly accepted hypothesis is the tandem duplication and random loss  model, which posits that rearrangements of the mitochondrial gene order have occurred via tandem duplications of some genes, followed by the random deletion of some of the duplications  <cit> . this model is widely used to explain gene rearrangements in vertebrate mtdna  <cit> .  the other two models are seldom used; one is the tandem duplication and non-random loss  model proposed by lavrov et al.  <cit> , and the other is the trna miss-priming model  <cit> .

fishes constitute the vertebrate group with the largest number of determined complete mtdna sequences . however, only a few gene rearrangements have been observed in fish , and genome-scale rearrangements are rare  <cit> . flatfish  have been found to be a diversified group for mitogenome rearrangements. studies of the cynoglossus semilaevis and paraplagusia japonica  mitogenomes have discovered the translocation of their control regions and a trna gene inversion  <cit> . however, no gene rearrangements have been detected in soles , the closest family to the cynoglossidae . this interesting event has also occurred in two other species belonging to close families bothidae and paralichthodidae. the mitogenome of crossorhombus azureus  exhibits genome-scale gene rearrangements, whereas the gene order of pseudorhombus cinnamoneus is intact  <cit> . these findings imply that the origin of gene rearrangements in different groups of pleuronectiformes was likely a case of “polyphyly”. due to the short divergence time between the fishes with and without gene rearrangements, many residual traces of these rearrangements may have been preserved; the mechanism of the rearrangement events may be inferred from these traces. kong et al.  <cit>  developed a model of inverse duplication and the deletion of redundant genes to explain gene rearrangements in tongue soles. to account for the gene rearrangements in blue flounder, shi et al.  <cit>  advanced the dimer-mitogenome and non-random loss model  that inferred the course of gene rearrangement in the blue flounder based on the typical gene order.

in the present study, the complete mitogenome of the deep-body righteye flounder, samariscus latus, was sequenced, revealing genome-scale rearrangements. the gene order of this flounder is different from those of tongue soles, blue flounder and all other vertebrate species reported so far and none of the gene rearrangement models can account for this event properly. thus, we deduced a novel mechanism of gene rearrangement for this flounder’s mitogenome.

methods
ethics statement
the fish specimen used in the present study was marine captured and purchased from dasi seafood market in keelung, taiwan. the species was not involved in the endangered list of iucn . specimen collection and maintenance were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations of animal care quality assurance in taiwan and chinese mainland.

sampling, dna extraction, pcr and sequencing
the specimen of s. latus was collected from taiwan. a portion of the epaxial musculature was excised from fresh specimen and was immediately stored at -70°c. total genomic dna was extracted using the sq tissue dna kit  following the manufacturer’s protocol. based on alignments and comparisons of complete mitochondrial sequences of flatfishes, dozens of primer pairs were designed for the amplification of the mtdna genomes . more than 30 bp of overlapping fragments between tandem regions were used to ensure the correct assembly and integrity of the complete sequence.

pcr was performed in a 25-μl reaction volume containing  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm of each dntp,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig>  u of taq polymerase ,  <dig>  μl of 10x taq buffer, and approximately 50 ng of dna template. the pcr cycling conditions included an initial denaturation at 95°c for 3 min followed by 30– <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 45 s, annealing at 45–55°c for 45 s, and elongation at 68–72°c for  <dig> -5 min. the reactions were completed by a final extension at 72°c for 5 min. the pcr products were purified with the takara agarose gel dna purification kit  and were used directly as templates for cycle sequencing reactions. sequence-specific walking primers were designed for both strands of each fragment and were employed for sequencing with an abi  <dig> dna sequencer . the mtdna sequences of s. latus have been submitted to genbank under the accession number kf <dig> 

sequence analysis
the sequenced fragments were assembled to create complete mitochondrial genome using codoncode aligner v <dig> and bioedit v <dig>  <cit> . during the processing of large fragments and walking sequences, regular manual examinations were performed to ensure the reliable assembly of the genome sequence. the annotation and boundary determination of protein-coding and ribosomal rna genes were performed using ncbi-blast . transfer rna genes and their secondary structures were identified using trnascan-se  <dig>   <cit> , with the cut-off values set to  <dig> when necessary.

the genome-scale mitogenome rearrangements in s. latus make the mitogenome of this species differ greatly from other known vertebrate mitogenomes. the typical gene order of vertebrate mitogenomes and that of s. latus mitogenome are shown in figure 1a and f, respectively. the genes of the typical genome are numbered consecutively from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . compared with the typical mitogenome, that of s. latus has undergone extensive changes to produce the following novel order:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  , ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 38′ . the rearrangement of s. latus mitogenome exhibits the following unique features: the first eight genes  retain the original position and order, followed by the insertion of a cr . the typical order  is largely changed into two gene clusters: an 11-gene cluster  and a 17-gene cluster , in both clusters the typical relative orders of the genes are maintained . the other cr-c-y fragment follows . the site of the last trna gene, trna-p , is unchanged, and the end is a noncoding fragment .

intergenic regions and control regions
the s. latus mitogenome contains  <dig> intergenic regions, nine of which are over 50 bp in length . given the parsimonious nature of the vertebrate mitogenome, the presence of so many long intergenic regions is surprising. we hypothesize that the reason for this phenomenon is that the intergenic regions are likely to be the residual sequences of genes that degenerated during the process of gene rearrangement. moreover, three large noncoding regions of cr <dig>  cr <dig> and nc are longer than 300 bp. the nc is located at the typical cr position, between the trna-f and trna-p genes, but it shows no sequence similarity to crs in other flatfishes. two cr fragments, cr1-c-y  and trna-s <dig> ) and cr2-c’-y’  and trna-p ), are identical in sequence. compared with the sequences of other flatfish crs, cr <dig> and cr <dig> exhibit the typical tripartite structures of the cr: terminal associated sequences , central conserved sequence blocks , a pyrimidine tract  and conserved sequence blocks   . the structures of cr <dig> and cr <dig> support the opinion that these two fragments are indeed the control regions same as other fishes except that s. latus mitogenome possesses two identical control regions.

gene rearrangement mechanism of s. latus mitogenome
mitogenome rearrangements have been reported in flatfishes   <cit> . the rearrangement of tongue sole mitogenomes is characterized by trna gene inversion, whereas that of the blue flounder is characterized by an l-strand coding gene cluster. however, the characteristics of s. latus rearrangements are completely different from those of the above flatfishes; therefore, there is little possibility that the gene order of s. latus mitogenome was derived from that of these flatfishes. thus, the models mentioned above  <cit>  that explain the mtdna rearrangements in these flatfishes do not perfectly suit to s. latus mitogenome.

some models, such as recombination  <cit>  and tdrl  <cit> , might help explain the mechanism of s. latus mitogenome rearrangements. however, several unique features of s. latus rearrangements prevent the application of these models to this species. for example, the recombination model requires that several  recombination events occurred during the course of rearrangement. moreover, gene rearrangements caused by recombination are unusual in the teleost fishes. the tandem duplication and random loss model  might have the applicability for gene rearrangements in s. latus mitogenome  <cit> , however, this model fails to highlight the specific features of s. latus mitogenome, such as gene clusters separated by crs and its remnants. as for the trna miss-priming  <cit>  and tdnl models  <cit> , no obvious corresponding characteristics exist in s. latus mitogenome.

the ancestral gene order of s. latus mitogenome is most likely the typical vertebrate order because the mtdna of all other flatfishes  follows the typical order. therefore, we propose a “double replications and random loss ” model to describe the rearrangement events that changed the ancestral gene order to that observed in s. latus mitogenome . the hypothesized intermediate steps from a typical gene order to that of s. latus gene arrangement are as follows. first of all, the cr was duplicated to cri and crii, and then the cri was translocated into the iqm  trna gene cluster. these events produced a genome with two crs , both of which contained origin of heavy  strand replication  and either of which could serve as the mitochondrial origin of replication . second, mitochondrial replication  was first initiated at oh <dig> . subsequently, after the replication elongation passed through oh <dig> , the other replication  began at oh <dig> . both replications terminated at oh <dig> . the closure event of the circular mtdna connected the 5′ end of the nascent strand of rp <dig> to the 3′ end of rp <dig>  the connection of the 5′ end of rp <dig> to the 3′ end of rp <dig> could be completed by another circular closure event or by an mtdna repair mechanism afterwards . the double replications resulted in a copy of  <dig> genes  from trna-m  to trna-p , with three crs  in the mtdna . in subsequent evolutionary events, one of each of the  <dig> duplicated gene pairs was randomly lost . the three crs followed different courses: cri retained its function, while crii and criii degenerated into two noncoding regions: nc  and an 86-bp intergenic region between trna-t  and trna-m  . finally, the fragment of cri- c1-y <dig>  were duplicated once, which were respectively named cr1-c-y and cr2-c’-y’, followed by the latter translocated to a position between trna-l <dig>  and trna-p  . these genome-scale rearrangements resulted in the mitogenome of s. latus containing two crs,  <dig> trnas, one 376-bp noncoding region and several long intergenic regions .figure  <dig> 
a duplication caused by double replications.  a mitochondrial replication event  was initiated at oh <dig>   rp <dig> passed through oh <dig>   rp <dig> was initiated at oh <dig>   both rp <dig> and rp <dig> terminated at oh <dig>  while the nascent h-strand of rp <dig> was replaced by that of rp <dig>   the connection of the 3′ end of rp <dig> to the 5′ end of rp <dig>  and the connection of the 5′ end of rp <dig> to the 3′ end of rp <dig>   the duplication was made permanent in the next round of replication.



details of the model
the evidence supporting the rearrangement event in the final step of the proposed model  is the presence of completely identical sequences in cr1-c-y and cr2-c’-y’. this finding indicates that both fragments were derived from the same original template during a very recent duplication and translocation event. based on trna-c, y is located between trna-q and trna-s <dig> in the typical vertebrate mitogenome, we infer that cr1-c-y is cri- c1-y <dig> at the original template location  and cr2-c’-y’ is a copy that then translocated to the site between trna-l <dig> and trna-p. more specifically, the recent ancestral gene order for s. latus mitogenome  is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  , , as illustrated in figure 1e.

both the copies of the original duplication of the cr  and cr-c-y  can be explained by tdrl or other possible mechanisms, however, there is no clear indication to confirm which one is more suitable for those duplication events. the duplication and translocation of cr is relatively common in gene-rearranged mitogenomes of metazoan, such as thrips, frogs, agamids, parrots, and so on  <cit> , which also occurred in teleost fishes  <cit> .

the gene order depicted in figure 1e clearly indicates that the genes from  <dig> to  <dig> were divided into two clusters , each of which retained the conserved relative gene order, from small to large. it is reasonable to assume that the two clusters were derived from a duplicated dna fragment that spanned genes  <dig> to  <dig> in the typical gene order . a remarkable characteristic of the duplicated dna fragment depicted in figure 1d is that it begins at one cr  and ends at another cr .

based on the characteristics of gene clusters separated by non-coding regions and crs, we propose the “double replications” model to explain the duplication of the dna fragment spanning genes  <dig> to  <dig> in the typical gene order. there are three distinctive differences between the proposed “double replications” process  and normal mitochondrial replication. one difference is the origination of the double replications from two crs  in one mitogenome . this is a possible process because there have been similar events in dimeric mitogenomes   <cit> . clayton has studied these kind of events and detailed the process of “double replications” in unicircular dimeric mouse mtdna with double crs. second, both replications  terminated at oh1; after originating from oh <dig>  rp <dig> did not terminate at the first encountered oh  . the reason for this phenomenon is as follows: when rp <dig> proceeded to oh <dig>  rp <dig> did not begin, and the relevant proteins or rna primer did not bind to oh <dig> . therefore, there was no termination signal  <cit> , and rp <dig> could bypass this region and normally terminated at oh <dig>  where the proteins and rna primer were bound when rp <dig> started. rp <dig> also terminated at oh <dig> because the first termination signal encountered by rp <dig> was also the one at oh <dig> . finally, the circular closure event of the double replications was different from normal replication, which the four ends  needed to be closed in pairs . because the initiation of rp <dig> occurred later than that of rp <dig>  the nascent h-strand of rp <dig> would have been replaced by that of rp <dig> from cr ii to cri. as a result, only the 5′ end of rp <dig> and the 3′ end of rp <dig> would remain bound at cri on the template l-strand, and the simplest means of connecting the ends would be the circular closure event at cri . the remaining two ends, the 5′ end of rp <dig> bound to crii and the freed 3′ end of rp <dig>  could be joined by the other circular closure event at crii or by mitochondrial repair  <cit>  . these double replications would represent a feature specific to triple crs . as in s. latus mitogenome, the three crs  developed into fully functional crs , a degenerated cr , and an 86-bp intergenic region between trna-t and trna-m, respectively; the latter has been almost entirely lost during evolution.

drrl model is different from the tdrl by the following features. first are the fixed replication origin points  but not the random sites as in the tdrl; second is the duplicated region which should start from an oh and end at another oh. indeed, the drrl model still needs more experimental evidence to verify. nonetheless, every step of the model follows the nature and rule of normal mitochondrial replications. and both replications  in our model initiated from the normal initiation sites, and terminated at the first met r-loop  sites  <cit> . existing other models and explanations are not comparable on this point .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome of a flatfish, s. latus. the genes of this mitogenome are extensively rearranged. the mitogenome is characterized by the duplication and translocation of the control region. the genes located between the two crs are divided into two clusters in which their relative orders are maintained. we proposed a “double replications and random loss” model to explain the rearrangement events in s. latus mitogenome. first of all, the cr was duplicated and translocated. double replications of the mitogenome were successively initiated from the two crs, leading to the duplication of the genes between the two crs. lastly, one of each pair of duplicated genes was lost in a random event.
