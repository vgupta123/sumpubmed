BACKGROUND
bioinformatics analysis reveals that two paralogous rpoa genes, each encoding non-identical proteins homologous to bacterial rna polymerase  α subunits, are present in the genome of francisella tularensis  <cit> . the bacterial rnap core enzyme has subunit composition α2ββ'. variations including fusion of the largest subunits, β and β', in helicobacter and wolinella genera  <cit> , and split the largest subunit in some cyanobacteria  <cit>  have been reported, but overall, the subunit composition of rnap core is conserved. the α subunit homodimer initiates bacterial rnap assembly. the α subunit monomers dimerize through their n-terminal domain   <cit> . the c-terminal domain  is connected to ntd through a flexible tether  <cit> . the αctd is not required for assembly but is involved in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the αntd homodimer provides a platform for interaction with the two large rnap subunits  <cit> . determinants in α important for interactions with β and β' subunits have been localized by mutagenesis and hydroxyl-radical footprinting studies  <cit> . substitutions at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of escherichia coli α subunit completely  or partially  prevented formation of the α2β rnap subassembly  <cit> . two point substitutions at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and two-amino-acid insertions at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of e. coli α caused defects in β' binding without affecting the α2β assembly formation  <cit> . rnap containing oriented e. coli α heterodimers have been prepared both in vitro, by reconstitution from recombinant subunits, and in vivo, by co-expression of genes for recombinant subunits, by using one α subunit lacking the r45a substitution and one α subunit having the r45a substitution  <cit> . functional analysis of rnap containing oriented α heterodimers confirmed that asymmetrical arrangement of α leads to non-identical functions of each monomer in transcription regulation  <cit> .

rnap core enzymes from archaea and eukaryotes contain homologs of each of the bacterial rnap core subunits. however, rather than having two identical α subunit homologs, they contain two different α-like polypeptides  that form a heterodimer, which serves as a platform for rnap assembly  <cit> .

the presence of two different genes  in the genome of francisella suggests that up to four rnap core enzymes differing in subunit composition could be present in the cells: two enzymes containing α homodimers, 2ββ' and 2ββ', and two enzymes containing α heterodimers, ββ' and ββ'  <cit> . the heterodimers could differ from one another with respect to which α interacts with the β subunit of rnap and which α interacts with β'  <cit> . promoter recognition properties of rnap holoenzymes formed from these different core enzyme molecules may differ, since ctd of α <dig> and α <dig> may be capable of different protein-dna and protein-protein interactions during transcription initiation  <cit> . further, if holoenzymes containing rnap core enzymes of different composition indeed respond differently to transcription factors and elements, then f. tularensis may regulate the spectrum of expressed genes by altering the relative ratio of core enzymes with different α subunit composition, which would be a novel paradigm of transcription regulation in bacteria.

evidence of that both α <dig> and α <dig> subunits are incorporated into f. tularensis rnap has been reported earlier by charity et al.  <cit> . these authors demonstrated that rnap affinity purified from f. tularensis strain expressing the β' subunit with fused tap-tag contained both α <dig> and α <dig>  these experiments clearly show that both rpoa genes are active and their products are components of rnap but do not inform about the actual subunit composition of f. tularensis rnap. based on predicted dimerization determinants in other bacteria  <cit> , charity et al. hypothesized that α <dig> and α <dig> might exclusively form either homodimers or heterodimers  <cit> . in the present study, we describe the results of in vitro analysis of assembly of rnap from f. tularensis subspecies novicida. our results indicate that rnap core containing an α heterodimer is the main, perhaps the only, species of rnap in this organism. we further present results of phylogenetic analysis that provide a plausible scenario for the appearance of two paralogous rpoa genes in the francisella lineage.

RESULTS
f. tularensis α heterodimer but not homodimers efficiently assembles in vitro
to experimentally address the ability of f. tularensis rnap α subunits to form homo- and heterodimers, we investigated the ability of recombinant f. tularensis α subunit proteins with c-terminal his6-tags to pull down untagged counterparts during ion metal affinity chromatography. as shown previously, f. tularensis rnap α subunits have different electrophoretic mobilities, with α <dig> migrating significantly faster than α <dig>  <cit> . in addition, his6-tags alter electrophoretic mobility of both α <dig> and α <dig> enough to separate tagged and untagged α subunits of the same kind .

therefore, because each of the four proteins used in the pull-down assay has a characteristic electrophoretic mobility, it is possible to detect the efficiency of both hetero- and homodimer formation. various pairwise combinations of α subunits were mixed at denaturing conditions , the denaturing reagent was removed by dialysis at conditions favouring bacterial rnap assembly from isolated subunits  <cit> , and reconstitution reactions  were loaded on ni2+-affinity columns. flow-through  was collected and retained protein was eluted  with different concentrations of imidazole in the buffer. aliquots of each fraction were next analyzed by sds-page. as can be seen from figure  <dig> , no co-immobilization of untagged α subunit in reactions that contained tagged and untagged versions of subunit of the same kind was detected. in contrast, heterodimers were readily detected when either α1his <dig> or α2his <dig> were used as "baits" for co-immobilization of, respectively, α <dig> or α <dig> . we conclude that f. tularensis rnap α subunits do not appreciably form homodimers, at least at the conditions of in vitro rnap assembly.

α1ntd and α2ntd efficiently interact in bacterial 2-hybrid system
rnap α subunit is a two-domain protein, with its n-terminal domain being primarily responsible for dimerization and interaction with large rnap subunits, while the c-terminal domain, ctd, which is connected to ntd through a flexible linker, is primarily responsible for interactions with transcription factors and dna upstream of the - <dig> promoter element  <cit> . weak dimerization of isolated αctd has been reported and may be of regulatory significance  <cit> . to independently study dimerization of various domains of f. tularensis α subunits, we used the bacterial two-hybrid system  <cit> . eight two-hybrid plasmids expressing bait and prey fusions of each α domain were constructed and  <dig> pairwise combinations were tested. the results are presented in table  <dig>  as can be seen, in agreement with in vitro co-immobilization data, strong interactions between αntds of different kinds were detected. αctds did not appreciably interact with each other or with αntds. the level of homotypic interaction between α1ntd was above the background, potentially indicating formation of α1ntd homodimer, while the level of α <dig> homodimer formation was at the background level.

eight two-hybrid plasmids expressing bait  and prey  fusions of each α subunit domain were constructed and  <dig> pairwise combinations were tested in a reporter strain by measuring β-galactosidase activity . each combination was tested at least three times independently. mean and standard deviation values are presented. three kinds of measurements were taken to determine background levels of β-galactosidase activity, which was found to be   <dig> ±  <dig> in host reporter cells with no plasmids,  <dig> ±  <dig> in cells transformed with pbrαln-α1ntd only, and  <dig> ±  <dig> in cells transformed with pacλci-α1ntd only.

formation of the α2β subassembly in vitro
rnap assembly follows a conserved pathway, whereby the β subunit interacts with the α dimer, leading to the formation of α2β - a stable intermediate of rnap assembly that can be observed both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . we performed in vitro rnap assembly using his6-tagged f. tularensis α subunits and untagged recombinant f. tularensis β. the results indicated that β was most efficiently immobilized when both α subunits were present in the assembly reaction . only trace amounts of β were co-immobilized in reactions containing α <dig>  and thus likely represented non-specific binding . the amount of β co-immobilized in reactions containing α <dig>  was higher than the background but clearly less than that observed in reactions containing both α subunits. we conclude from these experiments that β interacts most efficiently with α heterodimer. detected interaction between β and α <dig> can proceed through α <dig> monomer or, alternatively, the β subunit may stimulate formation of the α <dig> homodimer.

in vitro transcription by recombinant f. tularensis rnap
to validate data obtained using two-hybrid analysis and α dimer/α2β rnap subassembly in vitro reconstitution, in vitro rnap assembly and transcription experiments were performed. three in vitro rnap assembly reactions contained recombinant f. tularensis β and β' subunits and α <dig>  α <dig>  or both α <dig> and α <dig> . assembled rnap reactions were passed through a gel-filtration column, fractions that eluted at retention times expected for rnap core elution were collected and tested for transcription activity on a nucleic acid scaffold shown in figure 3a. nucleic acid scaffolds mimic the conformation of nucleic acids in transcription elongation complexes. rnap complexes with nucleic acids scaffolds are catalytically active and serve as a convenient tool to study transcription elongation properties of the enzyme  <cit> . reactions were combined with ntp, and elongation of radioactively labelled 8-nt rna component of the scaffold  followed. the results are presented in figure 3b. as can be seen, most efficient elongation of the rna primer was observed in fractions obtained from rnap assembly reaction containing both α subunits. fractions of rnap assembly reaction that contained α <dig> only were completely inactive. fractions of rnap assembly reaction containing α <dig> only demonstrated low but detectable transcription activity. we therefore conclude that f. tularensis rnap assembles efficiently when both kinds of α subunits are present; α <dig> alone is unable to promote rnap assembly; α <dig> alone supports rnap assembly, albeit with low efficiency, possibly due to low level of α <dig> homodimer formation.

evolution of rpoa in francisella
to gain insight into the evolution of two paralogs of rpoa in francisella, we retrieved all rpoa sequences in all of the  <dig> completely sequenced bacterial genomes available in the refseq database. we found that in addition to francisella, two rpoa genes  are present in several other genomes, namely in three chloroflexus species , in streptomyces avermitilis ma- <dig>  in psychromonas ingrahamii  <dig>  and in leptospira borgpetersenii serovar hardjo bovis l <dig> . in the latter two cases the two rpoa copies are identical and are apparently the result of very recent genome segment duplications that also include a number of other genes.

in order to address an alternative possibility, that one of the rpoa paralogs in francisella could have been horizontally transferred from a distant bacterial  lineage instead of arising through gene duplication, we reconstructed rpoa phylogenetic tree for a representative set of bacteria including those that contain rpoa duplications listed above . the resulting tree is generally very well compatible with bacterial taxonomy, which is not surprising considering the fact that rnap subunits are among the best phylogenetic markers  <cit> . the position of both rpoa branches corresponding to francisella within γ-proteobacteria is confidently supported by bootstrap analysis . thus, it is unlikely that any of the francisella rpoa genes were transferred from outside of the γ-proteobacterial lineage. branches leading to both francisella rpoa proteins are extremely long, which might cause an artefact of the long-branch attraction, making the francisella rpoa positioning unreliable. to test hypotheses for an alternative position of francisella rpoa branches, we used raxml  <cit>  program to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree for γ -proteobacteria with β-proteobacteria outgroup , made constrained trees and compared the maximum likelihood values for the best tree  and constrained trees. the first constrained tree was designed to test a hypothesis of monophyly of two rpoa paralogs of francisella; the second tree was designed to test a hypothesis of monophyly of both francisella rpoa and of homologs from coxiella, legionella, and thiomicrospira - species that are the closest taxonomic relatives of francisella . the analysis showed that none of the hypotheses could be rejected, suggesting that the positioning of rpoa at the root of γ-proteobacteria could be explained by long-branch attraction artefacts. thus, we conclude that the two rpoa copies in francisella most likely emerged through a duplication followed by acceleration of the evolutionary rates of both paralogs.

discussion
representatives of the bacterial genus francisella are unusual with respect to rnap composition, in that they contain two different α subunits encoded by two paralogous genes rpoΑ <dig> and rpoΑ <dig>  the presence of two different α subunits in affinity-purified rnap preparations  <cit>  suggested that as many as four different species of rnap core enzyme could be present in the single cell. here, we studied franicella rnap by means of in vitro assembly. our results show that franicella α heterodimer  efficiently assembles in vitro from fully denatured state and homodimers are not detected. bacterial two-hybrid analysis indicates that in addition to efficient α heterodimer assembly, some dimerization of α <dig> may also occur. thus, the efficiency of α dimerization is clearly a major factor that should affect subunit composition of francisella rnap. as was determined from crystal structure analysis, the main structural elements of the α dimer interface of e. coli are two α-helices, h <dig> and h <dig>  orthogonally oriented to each other  <cit> . these helices from one monomer participate in a coiled-coil-like interaction with their counterparts in the other monomer. within these helices, kannan et al.  <cit>  identified a cluster of amino acids stabilizing interactions at the e. coli α dimer interface, with residues 35f, 38t, and 39l emanating from one α monomer and residues 46i, 50s, and 227q from another. of particular interest are three of them, namely, 35f, 38t, and 46i, point mutations at which partially   <cit>  or completely   <cit>  prevented the dimer formation. as can be seen from figure 2b, amino acids at these positions are conserved  between e. coli and thermus, while amino acids in many of the corresponding positions in both α <dig> and α <dig> subunits from francisella differ. since these positions are critical for the dimer formation, it is reasonable to assume that some amino acids at these positions of francisella α subunits, for example, α1-36m, α1-39i, α2-33v, and α2-47t, may be unfavourable to the assembly of homodimers. however, in the absence of crystal structure or systematic mutagenesis data, it is currently not possible to identify structural reasons for hetero- and homodimerization of francisella α subunits.

during rnap assembly in organisms where α subunit forms a homodimer, the β subunit is free to interact with either α monomer to form the α2β subassembly. the situation must be different in the case of f. tularensis, where α heterodimers form preferentially. in e. coli, an evolutionary conserved α subunit residue arg <dig> is critical for β subunit interaction with the α dimer  <cit> . in f. tularensis, the corresponding position in α <dig> also contains an arginine , while in α <dig> this position is occupied by glutamine . thus, it appears that β subunit in f. tularensis will be specifically interacting with the α heterodimer through α <dig>  that α <dig> contains determinants for interactions with β also follows from results of the α2β subassembly reconstitution and in vitro transcription data, since francisella rnap containing α <dig> homodimer is functional and formation of an 2β intermediate can be detected in vitro, albeit with low efficiency. the latter result suggests that β may stimulate α <dig> dimerization. an alternative possibility would be β interacting with one α <dig> monomer, followed by association with another α <dig> and β', or the α1β' complex. be that as it may, our data suggest that bacteria of francisella genus produce a major form of rnap containing an oriented α1α <dig> heterodimer, and a minor form containing α <dig> homodimer.

as shown earlier by hydroxyl-radical-mediated proteolysis  <cit> , the segments of e. coli α most strongly protected by β correspond to amino acids 30- <dig> and 65- <dig>  and the segments of α most strongly protected by β' correspond to amino acids 175- <dig> and 195- <dig>  single alanine substitutions of e. coli α lys <dig> and val <dig> and two-amino-acid insertions at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of e. coli α cause defects in β' binding without affecting the α2β assembly formation  <cit> . to evaluate the ability of francisella α <dig> and α <dig> subunits to interact with the β' subunit, we compared sequences of e. coli α subunit involved in interaction with β'  <cit>  to those in f. tularensis α <dig> and α <dig> subunits . the results reveal that a lysine at a position corresponding to e. coli α position  <dig> is present in both α polypeptides from francisella, while amino acids corresponding to e. coli α val <dig> are, respectively, a valine and a leucine in α <dig> and α <dig>  similarly, the site of one two-amino-acid insertion that destroys β' interaction with α2β in e. coli, val <dig>  has as its counterpart a valine in α <dig> and an isoleucine in α <dig> of francisella. these conservative changes are unlikely to affect the efficiency of β' binding by the α polypeptides. interestingly, the site of the residue at the site of the second insertion affecting β' interaction with α2β in e. coli, lys <dig>  is conserved in francisella α <dig> and α subunits from other bacteria , but is substituted with threonine in α <dig>  the results thus implies that francisella β' interacts with α <dig>  further experiments will be needed to prove this conjecture.

our phylogenetic analysis indicates that none of the francisella rpoa genes was transferred from outside of the y-proteobacterial lineage. in fact, both genes most likely emerged through duplication of an ancestral single gene followed by acceleration of evolutionary rate of both paralogs. acceleration of rpoa evolutionary rate after the duplication apparently was accompanied by subfunctionalization of francisella α subunits, ultimately leading to accumulation of substitutions in residues responsible for homodimerization and involved in the  in archaea) heterodimerizes with its much smaller counterpart  in archaea)  <cit> . crystallographic and functional analyses indicates that large α homolog makes interaction with the second-largest  subunit through a surface that contains residue homologous to e. coli α arg <dig>  <cit> , and is thus formally similar to francisella α <dig>  the smaller α homolog of eukaryal and archaeal rnap thus corresponds to francisella α <dig>  one should not take this analogy to far though, since in eukaryotes and archaea, the α heterodimer is not sufficient for recruitment of large rnap subunits in the complex. eukaryal rpb <dig> and rpb <dig> and their archaeal homologs rpo <dig>  and rpo <dig>  form a stable complex with all four polypeptides playing an essential role in assembly and stability of the rnap complex  <cit> .

evolution of the rpoa duplication presented here is one of the best demonstrations in support of the lynch's subfunctionalization scenario where both copies are subject to relaxed selection and acceleration of the evolutionary rates but rarely develop a new or specialized function  <cit> . the fact that bacterial rnap α subunit functions as a dimer should make it particularly prone to duplication/subfunctionalization. indeed, while the impetus for our study came from an apparently unique situation with two different α subunits in francisella, bioinformatics analysis revealed additional instances of rpoa duplications, some fairly recent, like in s. avermitilis, others more ancient, like in chloroflexus species. despite the fact that these rpoa paralogs are being ancestral for the chloroflexus species, no drastic substitutions in regions responsible for dimerization and/or β/β' interactions have accumulated, suggesting that in contrast to the situation observed in fransicella, the two α subunits of chloroflexus may still be functionally equivalent. it is likely that many more instances of rpoa duplications and subfunctionalization will be found in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here support the following conclusions:  only francisella α-heterodimer  can be efficiently assembled in vitro;  strong direct interactions between α1ntd and α2ntd only have been detected in the bacterial two-hybrid system;  β interacts more efficiently when both of α <dig> and α <dig> presented in the reconstitution mix;  interaction between α <dig> and β subunits was observed to be stronger than interaction between α <dig> and β;  based on phylogenetic analysis, two rpoa copies in francisella most likely must have emerged through a duplication followed by acceleration of the evolutionary rates of both paralogs.
