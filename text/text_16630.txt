BACKGROUND
the adult thalamus is a complex structure in the centre of the brain, comprising clusters of functionally related cells organised into a large number of nuclei. thalamic nuclei form precise reciprocal connections with their targets in the cerebral cortex providing it with most of its sensory innervation via thalamocortical axons. in mice axons grow from the thalamus into the ventral telencephalon at around embryonic day 12- <dig> and then on to the cerebral cortex which they first reach at around e13- <dig>  <cit> . the development of the thalamus and its connections relies on intercellular communication mediated by secreted signalling proteins including wnt, slit, and netrin proteins  <cit> .

wnt signalling components are expressed in complex patterns in the developing thalamus itself and in the territory encountered by thalamocortical axons. wnt signalling is known to be important for thalamic development as targeted disruption of wnt proteins or their receptors result in severe thalamic development and connectivity defects  <cit> . β-catenin is an intracellular protein that can affect both cytoskeletal dynamics involved in cell motility and gene expression in the nucleus in response to extracellular signals including wnt proteins  <cit> . an intriguing feature of the adult thalamus is the expression of high levels of β-catenin protein. in fact the thalamus is unique within the adult cns in having sufficiently high levels of nuclear β-catenin to be easily detectable with immunohistochemistry and β-catenin mediated tcf/lef transcription plays a key role in defining the electrophysiological properties of thalamic cells  <cit> . while the manipulation of β-catenin activity has provided insights into the function of β-catenin in neural progenitor cells there are as yet no tractable transgenic models which allow the role of β-catenin to be studied in post-mitotic neurons  <cit> .

in this study we address the role of β-catenin in the thalamus and its axons at the time the thalamocortical tract is starting to form. first we use in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry, and a bat-gal reporter transgene to show that β-catenin is expressed at high levels both in cell bodies and in axons in the developing thalamus and that β-catenin mediated transcription is very active in thalamic cells at this time. netrin- <dig> is known to be a key regulator of thalamocortical development  <cit> . while the relationship between the wnt response and β-catenin is well established, β-catenin's relationship with netrin- <dig> is not, so we next used in vitro assays to show that netrin- <dig> treatment causes an increase in levels of β-catenin protein in thalamic growth cones and induces β-catenin dependent gene expression in thalamic cells. local translation of mrnas in growth cones is a well established mechanism to facilitate rapid changes in growth cone protein levels in response to guidance cues including netrin- <dig> so we hypothesised that thalamic axons might contain β-catenin mrna  <cit> . we performed an unbiased screen for mrnas present in thalamic axons, recovered β-catenin transcripts at high frequency and identified other transcripts in thalamic axons. using a combination of in situ hybridisation, gfp reporter transgenes, and quantitative rt-pcr we showed that β-catenin mrna is enriched in thalamic axons and sequence elements in its highly conserved 3'utr enhance protein expression along the thalamic axon..

RESULTS
expression of β-catenin in the developing thalamus
to assess the role of β-catenin in thalamocortical development we first studied the localisation of β-catenin mrna and protein in the thalamus at the time when it is projecting axons. in situ hybridisation for β-catenin at e <dig>  revealed higher mrna levels in the thalamus compared to much lower levels in adjacent prethalamus and ventral telencephalon . next we used immunohistochemistry to examine the cellular distribution of β-catenin protein in thalamic cells and their axons. within the thalamus there are numerous heavily stained cell bodies and axon fascicles . in the prethalamus  and internal capsule  of the same section, axon fascicles are heavily stained but cell bodies are much more weakly stained . immunofluorescence on cultured thalamic neurons shows that there are relatively high levels of β-catenin in the cell body and at the growth cone with lower levels in the intervening axon .

the bat-gal reporter transgene comprises multiple tcf/lef binding sites coupled to a bacterial lacz gene and provides a convenient readout of β-catenin mediated transcription  <cit> . at e <dig>  the bat-gal transgene reports at very high levels in the thalamus and much lower levels in the prethalamus, ventral telencephalon, and cerebral cortex through which thalamic axons navigate .

in conclusion, at the time the thalamus is projecting axons towards the cerebral cortex at e <dig> , thalamic cells contain high levels of β-catenin mrna and protein and are the site of particularly vigorous β-catenin mediated transcription.

netrin- <dig> induces changes in mrnas and in β-catenin protein levels in thalamic cells
netrin- <dig> mrna is present both in the thalamus, where thalamocortical cell bodies reside, and in the internal capsule, which thalamic axons grow through , so both thalamic cells and their axons are likely to encounter netrin- <dig> protein.

first, we hypothesised that the high levels of β-catenin mediated transcription we observed in the thalamus of bat-gal embryos  are contributed to by netrin- <dig>  we used qrt-pcr to measure levels of lacz mrna in thalamic cultures prepared from bat-gal embryos. as shown in figure 2b there was a significant increase in lacz mrna in cultures exposed to netrin- <dig> for  <dig> minutes compared to untreated controls, showing that netrin- <dig> can induce β-catenin mediated transcription in thalamic cells. l <dig> regulates thalamocortical axon fasciculation in the internal capsule and l <dig> mrna is upregulated in response to β-catenin signalling in other systems, expression of β-actin can be regulated by netrin- <dig> in xenopus retinal growth cones, and epha <dig> is required for ordered thalamocortcial axon navigation in the internal capsule and has not been linked with either β-catenin or netrin- <dig> function  <cit> . we found significant increases in the thalamic levels of β-actin and l <dig> mrnas but not epha <dig> mrna following netrin- <dig> treatment for  <dig> minutes .

we next asked whether netrin- <dig> treatment affects growth cone β-catenin. in order to monitor the response of thalamic cells to netrin- <dig> we employed a culture system in which thalamic explants were cultured on glass coverslips and allowed to extend axons. an example of a cultured thalamic explant, immunostained with β-catenin, is shown in figure 2d. cultures were exposed to netrin- <dig> , a concentration that has previously been shown to stimulate thalamic axon growth  <cit> . thalamic axons were exposed to netrin- <dig> for various time intervals  and processed for β-catenin immunofluorescence. an example of a growth cone stained for β-catenin is shown in figure 2e. the total pixel intensity of β-catenin indirect immunofluorescence was measured for each growth cone and values for growth cones treated with netrin- <dig> were then normalised against untreated control growth cones to show fold changes in the β-catenin signal . ten minutes of exposure to netrin- <dig> caused a 22% increase in β-catenin signal. after 1-hour exposure to netrin- <dig>  the β-catenin signal in the growth cones was reduced by 19%. one day after adding netrin- <dig> values were similar to those in untreated growth cones. this experiment demonstrates rapid and dynamic fluctuations in growth cone β-catenin concentration in response to the thalamocortical guidance cue netrin- <dig> 

identification of β-catenin mrna in thalamic axons
our data so far suggest a possible role for β-catenin in thalamic axon navigation. the rapid changes in β-catenin protein levels in growth cones exposed to netrin- <dig> suggest rapid β-catenin protein synthesis, perhaps followed by its degradation or movement away from the growth cone, in response to guidance cues. we next turned our attention to the distribution of β-catenin mrna in the thalamocortical system, particularly in the axons and growth cones where mrnas might be locally translated. as shown in figure 1a, β-catenin mrna is expressed at high levels by thalamic cells so we were interested to know whether the β-catenin transcript is present in axons and, to place our findings in context, how the distribution of β-catenin mrna related to that of other transcripts. we therefore isolated and analysed a set of mrnas found in the axons of embryonic thalamic neurons. in brain sections thalamic axons are closely associated with other cells and axons so we performed this analysis in cultures where thalamic axons can be unambiguously identified and isolated.

thalamic explants were placed in culture for  <dig> days allowing long axons to grow out  and then rna was prepared either  from thalamic explants which comprise cell bodies, axons, and growth cones or  from axons and growth cones alone . randomly-primed cdna was generated from these two rna samples and figure 3b shows a portion of a gel separating the amplified products.

thalamic axonal cdna was used to generate a plasmid library from which clones were randomly selected for sequencing. sequence data was recovered from  <dig> clones. blast analysis of these sequences against the mouse genome sequence revealed that the vast majority of them  mapped to transcribed regions . the remaining 16% of sequences mapped to regions annotated in the ensembl database as non-genic and we did not investigate them further although, given that newly transcribed regions of the genome are still being discovered, it is quite possible that they have functional significance  <cit> .

of the  <dig> clones that mapped to transcribed regions, 30% contained transcripts for mitochondrial 16s rrna, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome encoded by the mitochondrial genome  <cit> , whose presence in axons is predictable because they contain mitochondria. most of the remaining  <dig> clones mapped to exons of protein coding transcripts. table  <dig> lists protein coding genes for which cloned sequences mapped to exons. some genes were represented by more than one clone, notably ribosomal protein s <dig>  , β-catenin  and β-actin . also in table  <dig> are clones recovered from the axonal library that mapped to predicted intronic regions . these might be alternatively spliced exons not in the ensembl database  or might correspond to distinct overlapping genes.

ensembl identifier, mgi gene symbol and common name or description are given for each mrna along with whether the sequence recovered from the thalamic axon cdna library mapped to an exon  or an intron .

in conclusion, our unbiased screen recovered β-catenin mrna from thalamic axons. the high frequency of β-catenin clone recovery is suggestive of high abundance in thalamic axons. tellingly, the recovery frequency was similar to that for β-actin mrna, which has well established function in axon navigation in other systems  <cit> . the wide range of physiological functions encoded by the other thalamic axonal mrnas listed in table  <dig> mirrors that of mrnas found in mouse retinal and cortical axons  <cit> .

localisation of β-catenin mrna in the axon
in order to shed light on the distribution of transcripts between the cell body and the axon we performed a careful quantitative analysis using qrt-pcr to calculate the ratio of β-catenin mrna in thalamic axons to that in the thalamic explants from which the axons project . to place our findings in context we included five other transcripts recovered in our screen  and α-tubulin and map <dig> which are known to be enriched or depleted in the axonal compartment in other systems  <cit> . 18s rrna is a commonly used loading control for qrt-pcr experiments and is found in axons. transcript levels were normalised to 18s rrna levels in their own compartment. this ratio allowed us to assess the relative distribution of each transcript between axons and cells in the explant. the wide variation in axon:cell transcript ratios argues that the distribution of these transcripts between axon and cell body compartments is unlikely to be accounted for by a common mechanism, for example passive diffusion from soma to axon, as this would predict a relatively constant ratio. critically, a high axon:cell ratio suggests that a transcript is actively targeted to the axonal compartment and consistent with this map <dig> mrna  had the lowest ratio while β-actin and α-tubulin mrnas  had ratios about 10-fold higher  which are comparable to those of β-catenin, reticulon- <dig>  and synaptotagmin- <dig>  the greatest axonal enrichment was seen in the mrna encoding the ribosomal protein rps <dig> 

to determine the location of β-catenin mrna within the growing thalamic axons we used in situ hybridisation on cultured e <dig>  thalamic cells. an example of a thalamic neuron stained for β-catenin mrna is shown in figure 3d where strong staining is apparent in the cell body and in the growth cone with weaker staining in the intervening axon. densitometric analysis was carried out for β-catenin mrna . the upper red line in figure 3e shows quantification of the β-catenin in situ signal along thalamic axons from their cell bodies to their growth cones. it shows that the signal is highest in the cell bodies and the growth cones  and resembles the distribution of β-catenin protein . as a control the signal was measured in thalamic neurons reacted with a sense β-catenin dig labelled rna transcript . the anti-sense signal is significantly above background in the cell body and at the end of the axon indicating that β-catenin mrna is specifically enriched towards the growth cone. an identical analysis of β-actin mrna  and 18s rrna  showed them to be more evenly distributed along the length of the axon. β-catenin mrna is therefore subject to idiosyncratic positioning within the thalamic axon relative to at least two other axonal transcripts.

sequence and functional analysis of the β-catenin 3'utr
protein coding mrnas comprise an open reading frame  flanked by 5' and 3' utrs with sequence elements responsible for subcellular localisation frequently residing in the 3'utr so we next looked for evidence of phylogenetic conservation of β-catenin mrna 3'utr sequences. mouse β-catenin genomic sequence starting from the stop codon and extending  <dig> kb in the 3'  direction was compared to a variety of equivalent  <dig> kb vertebrate β-catenin genomic sequences using a m-lagan alignment algorithm. this revealed regions of striking sequence similarity within placental and marsupial mammalian species  with three closely adjacent peaks of conservation . this conservation extended to birds  and, although diminished, two peaks were still apparent in fish . notably this conserved region spanned ~ <dig> kb from the translation stop codon  to the polyadenylation signal  coinciding with the β-catenin 3'utr. this conservation is almost as high as that seen in the β-catenin protein coding orf  suggesting that functionally important sequences reside in the 3'utr.

we hypothesised that one conserved function of the β-catenin 3'utr is to direct protein expression to the axon. to test this hypothesis in thalamic axons we generated a reporter plasmid construct, pkr <dig> , comprising a myristoylated destabilised gfp  cdna fused at its 3' end to β-catenin genomic sequences encompassing the translation stop codon, 3'utr, polyadenylation signal, and  <dig> bp of downstream sequence. another construct, pkr <dig> , was generated with the majority of the 3'utr deleted leaving only a stub comprising the polyadenylation signal and sequence downstream of the 3'utr. this is a well established method to report on de novo translation because myrd1egfp protein contains a myristoylation sequence  to limit its diffusion from the site of translation and has a half-life of only one hour  <cit> . transcription was driven by the powerful ubiquitous cagg promoter  <cit> . if the hypothesis is correct then the chimeric gfp:β-catenin 3'utr mrna produced by transcription of pkr <dig> should be targeted to and translated in axons. reporter plasmids were introduced into thalamic explants by electroporation and the explants cultured for  <dig> days. cultures were then processed for gfp immunofluorescence . two parameters were quantified from these images:  the gfp fluorescence of the cell body and  the distance from the cell body where gfp fluorescence could be found in the axon. comparison of cell body values showed that pkr <dig> and pkr <dig> had indistinguishable gfp levels indicating that the majority of the β-catenin 3'utr is not needed for expression within the cell body . the cell body gfp levels measured for pkr <dig> and pkr <dig> are subsaturating as a myrd1egfp:sv <dig> 3'utr construct in an otherwise identical experiment yielded over 2-fold the cell body gfp values in figure 4e . the β-catenin 3'utr contributes to axonal expression of gfp as the pkr <dig> construct containing the full β-catenin 3'utr sequence frequently drove gfp expression all the way along the axon to a growth cone  and almost twice as far along the axon as the pkr <dig> construct from which most of the β-catenin 3'utr was deleted . in order to estimate the proportion of the axon these distances correspond to we performed an otherwise identical experiment using ptp <dig> which expresses a tau-tagged gfp  which efficiently fills thalamic axons  <cit>  giving a value for total axon length of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm. this allowed us to calculate that, on average, pkr <dig> drove detectable gfp signal 67% along the axon compared to 43% for pkr <dig>  these data are not consistent with axonal gfp expression passively reflecting gfp expression levels in the cell body as pkr <dig> and pkr <dig> have similar cell body gfp levels but pkr <dig> drives gfp significantly further along the length of the axon.. in conclusion the 3'utr of β-catenin mrna is sufficient to enhance the expression of a heterologous reporter protein in thalamic axons so is presumably able to do the same for endogenous β-catenin protein.

discussion
the dual functions of β-catenin in connecting cadherin molecules on the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton and in regulating tcf/lef mediated gene expression in response to wnt signalling in the nucleus make it an interesting candidate for coordinating the development of neural structures and connectivity  <cit> . while attention has focussed on the importance of wnt/β-catenin signalling in neural progenitors in the developing thalamus and elsewhere in the brain, the function of β-catenin activity in post-mitotic projecting neurons remains relatively unexplored  <cit> . the developing embryonic thalamus is a site of high levels of tcf/lef transcription mediated by nuclear β-catenin  <cit>  & present study. while a component of thalamic tcf/lef transcription is likely a response to wnt signalling, slit proteins which are also abundant in the thalamus and tissues encountered by its axons can turn on tcf/lef transcription when sensed by their robo receptor  <cit> . our new finding that netrin- <dig> can activate tcf/lef transcription adds to these options.

a key finding in this study is the rapid increase in the levels of β-catenin protein in thalamic growth cones in response to the axon guidance cue netrin- <dig>  as thalamic axons extend towards the cerebral cortex their growth cones become increasingly distant from the cell body posing a potential logistical problem if all new protein must be translocated from the cell body. a classic mechanism to overcome this is for growth cones to carry mrnas that can be translated locally  <cit> . as a precedent from another system, β-catenin mrna is found in migrating astrocytic filopodia and hippocampal growth cones where its translation in response to the neurotrophic factor nt <dig> is dependent on the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein  binding to discrete elements in its 3'utr  <cit> . therefore, while we have not directly addressed whether or not β-catenin is locally translated in thalamic growth cones in the present study, our finding that β-catenin mrna is present in thalamic axons and that elements in its 3'utr assist protein expression in the thalamic axonal compartment make it a strong possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence that β-catenin mrna and protein are expressed at high levels in mouse embryonic thalamic cells and their axons at the time connections are being formed with the cerebral cortex. we find that netrin- <dig> induces β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity in thalamic cells and induces rapid changes in the growth cone levels of β-catenin protein. we find that the 3'utr of β-catenin mrna is sufficient to direct protein expression to the axon. taken together these findings point to an important role for β-catenin in post-mitotic neurons during the development of thalamocortical connectivity.
