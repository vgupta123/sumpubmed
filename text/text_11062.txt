BACKGROUND
equine infectious anemia virus  is a retrovirus of the lentivirus subfamily which also includes hiv- <dig>  hiv- <dig> and simian immunodeficiency viruses . compared to the primate lentiviruses the eiav genome is the smallest  and genetically simplest as it contains only three accessory genes  in addition to the canonical retroviral elements gag, pol, and env. as with other retroviruses the gag polyprotein pr <dig> of eiav is required and sufficient for assembly and budding of virus like particles. the cleavage of the pr <dig> gag-precursor by the virus-encoded protease thereby yields the four major internal structural proteins: the matrix , capsid , nucleocapsid , and p <dig> proteins  <cit> . the gag proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and targeted to the plasma membrane where they assemble into immature budding particles that consist predominantly of uncleaved polyproteins and are released from the cell membrane  <cit> . maturation of the eiav particle occurs concurrently with or shortly after release of the progeny virion in concert with protease activation.

the genomic position of p <dig> is analogous to that of the hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein and other similar proteins from different lentiviruses. compared to hiv- <dig> p <dig>  eiav p <dig> has only minimal amino acid sequence homology and a considerable variation in the predicted secondary structure. besides the function of p <dig> in viral dna production and processing of the provirus  <cit> , p <dig> plays, like p <dig> of hiv- <dig>  an essential role in virus release, which are governed by late assembly domains . proline-rich l-domains, such as ptap and pppy have been identified in hiv- <dig>  rous sarcoma virus , and a variety of other enveloped viruses  <cit> . the hiv- <dig> ptap motif specifically interacts with the n-terminus of the tumor susceptibility gene  <dig> , a component of the host endosomal sorting complex required for transport i , a system that regulates membrane fission during multivesicular body  formation and cytokinesis  <cit> . interestingly, the eiav ypdl l-domain motif has been shown to interact with two cellular proteins, the alg-2-interacting-protein-x   <cit>  and the μ <dig> subunit of the ap- <dig> adaptor protein complex  <cit> .

although l-domains appear to interact with different cellular proteins, a certain functional interchangeability has been reported. for example, both ptap and pppy motifs can substitute for the ypdl domain to support eiav replication  <cit> . these observations indicate that retroviruses, along with other enveloped viruses, have evolved different l-domains to specifically exploit certain host cellular machineries for virus budding and release.

recently, we have characterized the structure of the hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein  <cit> , and others have studied the structure of p <dig> fragments in complex with binding partners tsg <dig> and alix  <cit> . among known lentiviruses, the 51-amino acid eiav p <dig> protein is one of the smallest proteins and the molecular structure has not been defined hitherto. with the goal of understanding the molecular mechanism involved in the biological function of p <dig>  we have explored the high resolution structure and folding of p <dig>  derived from the eiavwyoming isolate, under various solution conditions. although the molecule exhibits a high degree of flexibility in a pure aqueous environment it adopts α-helical structures in an hydrophobic environment simulated by organic solvents. according to high resolution nmr data, p <dig> consists of two independent structural domains, an unstructured n-terminus and an extended c-terminal helix. the structure of p <dig> was compared with that of hiv- <dig> p <dig>  and their similarities and differences are discussed in terms of differences in their l-domain functions.

RESULTS
synthesis and purification of synthetic p <dig> 
an overview of the previously reported binding domains for alix and ap- <dig> within the eiav p <dig> protein and their relationship to the primary structure derived from the eiavwyoming sequence, together with the predicted sites of post-translational modification, are shown in fig.  <dig> 

the sp <dig> molecule  and its fragments  were chemically synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis  and purified to homogeneity. the specific procedure, established previously by us for the hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein  <cit>  with respect to the use of coupling agents, protection groups, cleavage reagents, and duration of coupling reactions, gave reproducibly high yields  of purified sp91- <dig>  it avoided problems normally encountered in such syntheses that include incomplete deprotection and coupling, inter- and intra-chain reaction with the resin matrix, side chain reactions, and peptide aggregation.

we also synthesized n- and c-terminal fragments of p <dig> using the same spps protocol. after cleavage from the resin, the crude peptides were purified. illustrative data are shown in additional file  <dig> for the full-length peptide sp91- <dig> and the n- and c-terminal fragments thereof . the purity of sp91- <dig> and its related fragment peptides was confirmed by molecular mass determination using positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry . the experimental results for sp91- <dig> showed a well defined multiply charged spectrum showing 7-4-fold positively charged ions  that was deconvoluted to give an intense envelope for the molecular ion cluster + centered at a molecular mass of  <dig>  da , corresponding to a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  da. this was confirmed by maldi-ms . similarly, the n- and c-terminal fragments of p <dig> also afforded high quality data and the correct molecular masses . the cumulative hplc and ms data indicated sp91- <dig> and its fragments showed very little evidence of by-products and were pure enough  for biophysical studies.

predicted structural details of eiav p9
several in-silico prediction programs have been employed to derive secondary structure information from the p <dig> primary sequence . all predictions converge to indicate that p <dig> is largely an unstructured molecule that has only a small propensity for helical structure . the predicted helix is located in the c-terminal region, while the n-terminus of the molecule contains very little secondary structure if any. however, all the prediction algorithms indicate the c-terminal region has at least 7-residues in an α-helical conformation located between leu- <dig> and glu- <dig>  a further short helix, approximately  <dig> residues in length, is centered on residue- <dig> . thus, the in silico analysis suggests the existence of two c-terminal helices in p <dig> 

c-terminus contributes to p <dig> secondary structure
a first insight into the secondary structure and folding of sp91- <dig> and its fragments thereof was obtained by analysis of the peptides at ambient temperature under various solution conditions by circular dichroism  spectroscopy. we simulated a hydrophobic environment by using the organic solvent trifluoroethanol  to assess the degree of secondary structure under hydrophobic conditions. tfe is chosen for its well known characteristics as it favors intramolecular interactions and stabilizes secondary structure, particularly α-helices in domains of a peptide that have a propensity for such secondary structure  <cit> . as tfe tends to disrupt quaternary structure and dissociate peptide aggregates, it can alleviate problems occurring with intermolecular interactions in the higher concentration ranges required for nmr investigations and provide a platform to perform cd and nmr studies under similar solution conditions.

the far-ultraviolet cd spectra of the full length molecule and its fragments are shown in fig.  <dig>  the spectrum of sp91- <dig> shows a strong ellipticity minimum at  <dig> nm with a small shoulder near  <dig> nm under aqueous  conditions, which is characteristic of a random coil conformation with very little evidence of secondary structure . although a negative signal near  <dig> nm could be associated with disordered structure, the broad nature of the band suggests the presence of some structure. a similar spectrum was obtained when the molecule was analyzed at physiological ph . however, addition of 50% tfe , affords two sharp signals at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm and a positive signal at ~ <dig> nm, indicating establishment of an α-helical structure under these hydrophobic conditions. yet, the full length molecule looses significant α-helical content in 50% tfe at neutral ph . thus, the cd data suggest that sp91- <dig> adopts α-helical structure in the presence of a hydrophobic environment under acidic conditions that is less stable in neutral ph.

two synthetic n- and c-terminal fragments were used to locate the structured region of the molecule by comparing the respective secondary structure contents. in 50% tfe  the n- and c-terminal fragments showed ca.  <dig> % and  <dig> % helical content, respectively, indicating secondary structure is predominantly located in the c-terminal section of the molecule  whereas the n-terminal fragment sp91- <dig> showed no evidence of secondary structure under any of the conditions used, suggesting it is largely unstructured and does not contribute to the secondary structure of the molecule. in contrast, the c-terminal fragment exhibited folding behavior similar to that of sp91- <dig> under the same solution conditions . the percentage helical content calculated for the c-terminal fragment of ~34%, using the dicropot  <dig> program, corresponds to  <dig> amino acids which is in-line with our observation for the full length molecule and confirms the c-terminus contains the locus for most of the secondary structure in the molecule .

a only for central structure

identification of structural elements in sp91- <dig>  sp922- <dig>  and sp91- <dig> by 1h nmr spectroscopy
in order to define in more detail the position of secondary structure identified by cd spectroscopy, we have recorded 1h nmr spectra of full length sp91- <dig> and the n- and c-terminal fragments sp91- <dig> and sp922- <dig> dissolved in 50% aqueous tfe-d <dig>  initially, we have analyzed the structural characteristics of the peptides on the basis of 1hα chemical shift data, which correlate with the chemical environment of the respective amino acid residues and therefore have proven to be useful for determining the presence, nature and exact position of secondary structure elements in such molecules  <cit> . for instance, a minimum of four adjacent residues, showing pronounced upfield shifts relative to random coil values  indicate local helical structure while downfield shifts  of three or more adjacent residues are indicative of α-helical structures. in order to obtain these data a set of one- and two-dimensional  1h nmr spectra was recorded for each peptide. signal assignments of the nmr spectra were accomplished using a standard procedure combining homonuclear 2d tocsy and 2d noesy nmr spectral data  <cit> . individual spin systems were identified from 2d tocsy spectra, starting from the backbone amide protons. sequence-specific assignments were determined from cross-peaks in the 2d noesy spectra based on short observable distances between 1hn, 1hα and 1hβ nuclei of amino acid residue i and 1hn of residue i+ <dig>  spin systems that could readily be recognized were used as starting points to establish residue positions in the peptide sequence.

for each peptide the 1hα chemical shift differences relative to random coil values were determined and plotted against the respective sequence . it can readily be seen that no substantial secondary structure is present in the n-terminal portion of sp <dig>  as no stretch of adjacent residues showing either upfield or downfield shifts is present. the only pronounced downfield shifts observed for glu- <dig> and thr- <dig> can be explained by the presence of a proline residue in position  <dig>  as demonstrated previously in the context of hiv- <dig> vpr  <cit>  proline residues generally cause unusual intrinsic downfield shifts of  <dig>  ppm ±  <dig>  ppm in the preceding residues and of  <dig>  ppm ±  <dig>  ppm in residues two positions towards the n-terminus. taking this proline-effect into consideration clearly rationalizes the downfield shifts of glu- <dig> and thr- <dig> and implies that these residues are in an unstructured environment.

unlike the n-terminus, the c-terminal region shows a large number of upfield shifts comprising residues ser- <dig> to leu- <dig> and therefore is clearly indicative of the presence of helical structure in this section of the molecule . even though residues glu- <dig> and glu- <dig> exhibit upfield shifts of only -  <dig>  and -  <dig> , respectively, it seems most likely that they are both part of a continuous helix, which in the case of glu- <dig> becomes evident by the presence of very pronounced upfield shifts of the neighboring residues ser- <dig> and ile- <dig>  and in the case of glu- <dig> by a further stretch of seven weakly helical residues located directly to the c-terminal side of glu- <dig>  however, as the upfield shifts of these residues  are distinctly less pronounced we assume that this part of the helix possesses decreased stability. at its n-terminus the helix is delimited by pro- <dig>  a residue that is often considered to be a helix-breaker.

a comparison of the 1hα chemical shift differences of the full length molecule with those of the two fragments reveals that they are almost identical apart from residues leu- <dig> to leu- <dig>  this observation can easily be explained with the fact that this site represents the interface of the two fragments and therefore the respective c-  or n-terminus  whereas it is the central region of full length sp <dig> 

it was possible to identify and quantify only a limited number of unambiguous medium range noes in the 2d noesy spectrum of sp91- <dig> and these were insufficient to calculate a meaningful structure. however, they could be used to assess secondary structure in the full length molecule. the interproton distances dnn and dαn were determined and their ratios were used to calculate the probabilities for secondary structures in short segments  of the sp91- <dig> molecule. in an ideal α-helix dnn is  <dig>  Å and dαn is  <dig>  Å while an extended strand shows distances of  <dig>  Å for dnn and of  <dig>  Å for dαn, respectively. using the equation given by bradley et al.  <cit>  the combination of these and the experimentally determined values of these distances allows an estimation of whether the respective dipeptides are in a helical, extended or a more unordered conformations. fig.  <dig> shows the probability for particular secondary structure against the sequence of sp <dig>  although there was no full sequence coverage with the required signals from the noesy spectrum it can readily be deduced from the plot that no marked and well defined secondary structure is present in the n-terminal section of the molecule. even though most dipeptides in the region pro-1/ile- <dig> to asn-21/leu- <dig> show a weak propensity for helix formation the merely moderate increase of values suggest a more random rather than a stable helical conformation. these change towards the c-terminus  where a large majority of the observed distance combinations results in clearly increased values thereby implying the presence of an α-helix in this region.

structure calculations from quantitative noe data
the problem observed above for the full length molecule was caused by the overlap of signals that could therefore not be unambiguously identified or accurately quantified in the 2d spectra. most likely, this problem arose from the high proportion of similar amino acids in the p <dig> sequence  that are distributed throughout the molecule. as all the qualitative data indicate the sole structured region in the molecule is restricted to the c-terminal region we focused our attention on the c-terminal peptide. this resolved the problem of signal overlap and allowed identification of sufficient medium range noes for structure calculations.

hence after quantification of the noe data a total of  <dig> noes  were used as distance restraints to calculate  <dig> structures using a standard protocol  <cit> . the  <dig> structures with the lowest noe and total energies and without distance violations greater than  <dig>  Å were chosen for the final fitting analysis . the heterogeneity within these structures was assessed using the consecutive segment approach, in which the rmsd  of the backbone atoms for short segments, 2- <dig> residues in length, were systematically and pair wise determined  <cit> . this analysis allows identification of regions of high similarity within the  <dig> final conformations and therefore identification of stable structural elements. the best defined regions of the molecule were then those showing rmsd of the backbone atoms of less than  <dig>  Å, namely a continuous stretch comprising amino acid residues asp- <dig> to glu- <dig> in which the  <dig> refined structures share a high degree of similarity . this finding is in good agreement with the 1hα chemical shift data, the observed qualitative noes, and the bradley-analysis which all suggest the presence of a well defined α-helix in the region ser- <dig> to leu- <dig> 

a central structure, in terms of the position in 3d space, was determined for the selected  <dig> lowest noe and total energy structures using lsqman and molman <dig> . the central structure was then used as a template to superimpose and compare the other  <dig> refined low energy structures and the resulting set of aligned conformations is shown in fig. 6c. the central structure is shown in fig.  <dig> with a helical conformation between residues ser- <dig> and leu- <dig> 

discussion
secondary structure of p <dig> is strongly dependent upon solution conditions
previous studies have established p <dig> as the functional equivalent of the hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein, although these proteins of almost identical size have only limited sequence homology. therefore, a comparison of the structural properties of these two analogous proteins is required to understand their structure-function relationships and their interactions with the same cellular factors such as alix. in water, p <dig> adopts a random coil conformation without any preference for secondary structure  <cit>  while in a hydrophobic environment specific regions, residues 14- <dig>  and residues 35- <dig> , of the molecule adopt helical structure  <cit> . helix  <dig> of hiv- <dig> p <dig> appears to be important for specific binding interactions with alix  <cit> .

in the quest to establish the structural details of the eiav p <dig> molecule, cd analysis of sp91- <dig> shows that the molecule has no significant or very little secondary structure when dissolved in pure water at ph  <dig> or in buffer at physiological ph  <dig> . however, secondary structure is observed and clearly stabilized in the presence of increasing amounts  of tfe used to introduce a more hydrophobic environment that is assumed to more closely simulate in vivo conditions where p <dig> is exposed to the hydrophobic surfaces of other proteins. however, for sp91- <dig> maximum α-helical content was found at room temperature in 50% aqueous tfe at ph  <dig> that decreased upon changing the ph to  <dig> , irrespective of the hydrophobic environment . the cd data for the n- and c-terminal fragments clearly indicate secondary structure formation in solution is restricted to the c-terminus of the molecule. this fragment also behaves in a similar manner to the full length molecule in that maximal structure is found in 50% tfe and is less stable at physiological ph .

as in our previous structural elucidation of hiv- <dig> p <dig> we completely assigned the 1d and 2d 1h nmr spectra of sp91- <dig>  in conjunction with its n- and c-terminal fragments, to afford the position and nature of structured regions in the molecule. well established criteria used previously by us, namely 1hα chemical shifts, indicate in its most structured state sp <dig> shows one region with a propensity for α-helical structure in the c-terminal region of the protein extending from leu-26/ile- <dig> to ser- <dig>  according to the chemical shift differences in both the full-length sp <dig> and the shorter c-terminal peptide sp922- <dig> there is some indication that the structured region extends back to residue leu- <dig>  the smaller negative differences observed towards the c-terminus indicate a weakening of the helical interactions in this region. a probability analysis for helical or extended conformation of dipeptidic segments for a limited number of interproton distances in the full length molecule support this conclusion . the c-terminal fragment exhibited  <dig> % helical content in 50% tfe. in contrast to the c-terminal peptide there was no evidence of any structured region in the n-terminus either in the full length molecule or its n-terminal peptide. this was apparent even under the most favorable conditions  independently from both the cd and nmr data.

based on the above and the limited number of unambiguously assigned medium range noes caused by signal overlap of similar amino acid spin systems in sp91- <dig>  structural calculations were undertaken of the c-terminal fragment sp922- <dig>  which contains the l-domain and the only structured region of the molecule. the molecular dynamic calculations, using a total of  <dig> quantitative noes that included  <dig> sequential and  <dig> medium range noes, afford a central arrangement that confines the helical structure to the region between glu- <dig> to asp- <dig> .

comparison of the structure of eiav p <dig> and hiv- <dig> p6
a considerable amount of literature now exists suggesting that eiav p <dig> and hiv- <dig> p <dig> have several functions in common. interestingly, these two functionally analogous proteins possess quite different biochemical and biophysical properties i.e. primary sequence, hydrophilicity and net charge, which would be expected to lead to different protein-protein interactions in the respective host cell system. both proteins possess little sequence homology  and are predicted to differ significantly in their phosphorylation propensities. hiv- <dig> p <dig> was characterized as a largely phosphorylated protein  <cit> . similarly, both molecules have two ubiquitinylation sites and were shown to become mono-ubiquitinylated, and in the case of p <dig>  sumoylated, fig.  <dig> <cit> .

in their most structured states both molecules possess stable secondary structure although neither molecule possesses a stable tertiary structure. in a hydrophobic environment at low ph, both adopt helical secondary structure in their c-termini, although the helical region in p <dig> is longer  than that of p <dig>  under the same conditions. in each case the molecules are highly flexible and, unlike most structured proteins, must be considered as a dynamic equilibrium of many different conformers that have the overall propensity for secondary structure in the regions depicted in fig.  <dig>  nevertheless, in its most structured form, the p <dig> molecule adopts a helix-turn-helix conformation in its c-terminal region whereas p <dig> assumes a single continuous helical conformation. the charge distribution within p <dig> and p <dig> is also distinctly different as the helix of p <dig> contains more charged residues than p <dig> . such differences in this helical region will be important for specific interactions with host cell factors .

the l-domains of p <dig> and p <dig>  as well as similar domains from other viral systems, have received considerable attention as they play critical roles in controlling the interaction with the host system that finally promotes viral budding and particle release  <cit> . these interactions involve the binding of specific regions of each molecule with components of the escrt  <cit> . of particular relevance is the well-defined interaction of both molecules with alix, an escrt associated, multifunctional protein that interacts with both escrt-i and escrt-iii. the alix-binding motif in both molecules responsible for this interaction has been defined recently as  px1-3lxx   <cit>  and corresponds in our case to 22lypdlsei in p <dig> and 35lyplaslrsl in p <dig> in which essential residues are in bold. recently, the structure of alix has been worked out in detail  <cit>  and its interaction with p <dig> was modeled based on nmr data of p <dig>  <cit> . in this model the c-terminal helix found in hydrophobic environments aligns coaxially with three helices in the alix v domain long arm to form a four-helix bundle  <cit> . the presence of a similar helical motif in the c-terminus of p <dig> presumably affords the same binding interaction. it is important to note that the alix-binding domain of p <dig> is located within the helical region of the molecule while in p <dig> it is located in a partially unstructured region.

the structural investigations on p <dig> and p <dig> offer a rationale for the different spacing of the essential residues in the alix-binding domains pointed out by munshi et al.  <cit> . during alix binding hydrophobic conditions pertain and both molecules will adopt their most structured conformations. in p <dig> the alix-binding domain 22lypdl27sei motif is at the junction of an unstructured and beginning of the helical region  of the molecule in this conformation , while in p <dig> the whole 35lyplaslrsl motif is found within the helical region under the same conditions, fig.  <dig> <cit> . in this helical conformation the essential lysine residue at position  <dig> in p <dig> is brought into the proximity of the  <dig> amino acid sequence lyp through the introduction of one helix turn, the intervening two residues are now on the opposite side of the helix away from the hydrophobic interaction site of the alix v domain  <cit> . this re-arranged recognition site of adjacent residues 35lyp 40slrsl now imitates the alix motif lypdlsei of p <dig>  thus, the helical conformation in p <dig> is required to position the essential residues correctly and maintain the alix-p <dig> functional interaction by re-orienting the 39la residues to the other side of helix away from the interaction site, while this is not necessary for p <dig>  in addition, the c-terminal helix of p <dig> is substantially longer than the corresponding helix in p <dig>  and thereby has a larger surface for potential interaction with the alix v domain. these structural differences in the alix-binding domains of the two molecules are reflected in the considerably higher thermodynamic stability of the p9-alix complexes  <cit>  suggesting p <dig> has an optimized alix-binding site compared to that of p <dig>  <cit> .

recently, the x-ray structures of the complexes of alix with short synthetic peptides corresponding to the l-domains of hiv- <dig> p <dig> and eiav p <dig> have been elucidated  <cit> . in these studies, the conserved tyrosine residue of the l-domains plays a crucial role in positioning the peptides in the same hydrophobic groove of arm  <dig> of the alix v domain. in keeping with our analysis of the solution structures an extra helical turn is observed in the crystal structure of p <dig> to position leu- <dig> in the same position as leu- <dig> in p <dig>  these structures also define the orientation of the peptide chains and indicate the alix v domain is able to accommodate the short peptides without any major helical movements between the free and bound forms. according to our solution data the c-terminal helical region of both p <dig> and p <dig> could be accommodated towards the open neck of the alix v domain  <cit>  while the flexible n-termini would allow these to be accommodated in the loop region. it remains to be determined whether these interactions of the full length proteins in the context of the uncleaved gag polyprotein cause unfolding of alix.

until recently the l-domains of p <dig> and p <dig> have usually been defined as those regions containing the ypdl and pt/sap motifs, respectively  <cit> . clearly this implies the alix-binding domain and l-domain motifs overlap  in p <dig>  but are separated in p <dig> where the l-domain is positioned proximal to the ptap motif, fig.  <dig> 

for p <dig>  the ptap l-domain binds to tsg <dig>  the human equivalent of vps <dig> of the yeast escrt-i complex that has recently been completely defined structurally  <cit> . currently, there is no evidence of an equivalent interaction for p <dig>  indeed, the optimized alix binding site in p <dig> implies eiav requires only a single l-domain for budding while the suboptimal binding site found in p <dig> requires the presence of a second site that functions through binding to tsg <dig>  this is corroborated by sequence data for p <dig> derived from different siv strains where those containing high affinity alix binding sites do not have a tsg <dig> binding site and vice versa  <cit> .

thus, it can be argued that the ypdl l-domain of eiav does not require an independent escrt-i interaction  <cit>  as the interactions between escrt-i and escrt-iii are bridged through an appropriate conformation of alix stabilized by the strong interaction of p <dig>  presumably, in this bound form the n-terminal domain of alix binds to the escrt-iii complex while the c-terminal proline-rich region binds the tsg <dig> binding domain of escrt-i.

in summary, p <dig> from eiav, like p <dig> from hiv- <dig>  is structurally very labile and can exist in a number of conformational states that depend on its environment and the presence of binding partners that interact with specific domains in the molecule.

CONCLUSIONS
although p <dig> and p <dig> are sequentially quite different, both possess c-terminal helical structures in their most structured states that must be present during binding to the hydrophobic pocket of alix, a central control node in viral budding. differences in the structural features in the vicinity of the alix-binding motif correlate with the different binding properties of the molecules and with the requirement of a further l-domain found only in p <dig> in the weakly structured n-terminal domain.
