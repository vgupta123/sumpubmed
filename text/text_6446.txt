BACKGROUND
the development of massively parallel sequencing or next generation sequencing  platforms provide the capacity for high-throughput sequencing of whole genomes at low cost. however, while those platforms improve the capacity to find novel variations that are not covered by existing genotyping arrays, they do not make use of the existing data, composed of thousands of relatively small genomic regions that have been associated with diseases through the use of genome wide association and linkage studies, where isolation of causative genetic variants has been problematic.

the efficiency of ngs-mediated genotyping has recently been improved through employing amplicon libraries of long-range pcr, which encompass discrete genomic intervals  <cit> . however, this method of library construction remains time-consuming, costly and limited to very small genomic regions  and is impractical for genetic dissection of disease linked loci which can span  <dig> mb or more. the development of molecular inversion probes  and the use of chip-based technologies for massively parallel capture of specific genomic targets is limited by representational and allelic bias and remains costly and time consuming  <cit> . recent advances in genome enrichment technologies provide efficient methods of region-specific, in-solution partitioning of regions spanning several megabases  <cit> . these technologies can be used to "capture" whole contiguous regions or generate exon specific libraries for discovery of functional variants within regions determined by genome wide association and linkage studies. however, the efficiency of genome partitioning and ngs is also compromised, since at the current size of capture for example up to  <dig> mb, the depth of read for a single sample, through a single lane of illumina gaiix , far exceeds that needed for confident snp calling.

nucleotide-based barcodes have been used to multiplex individual samples for use on ngs platforms  <cit> . this methodology exploits the sequencing depth of ngs technologies to sequence multiple samples in a single flow cell, reducing costs and increasing throughput. while these methodologies represent a significant advance in resequencing throughput, they do not provide the ability to target sequencing to specific disease-linked loci. the importance of continued sequencing efforts, particularly in focused populations, to analyse the differences between disease-affected and unaffected individuals has been recognised  <cit> . to achieve this outcome, the next logical step has been to combine multiplexing barcode technology with targeted enrichment. this has the effect of focussing the power of ngs sequencing onto a particular region , and simultaneously allowing pooling and later de-convolution of individual dna samples. the outcome of this is to increase the throughput and significantly reduce the cost of resequencing disease-linked loci in large cohorts.

our experimental data describes a cost effective, high throughput method for region-specific, multiplex sequencing by combining genome partitioning and barcode indexing with ngs technology. individual samples were multiplexed prior to sequencing and successfully separated in silico after sequencing on the illumina gaii platform. genomic libraries were selectively enriched for the human chromosome x exome using agilent's sureselect methodology and resulting sequences were efficiently mapped to the human x chromosome.

RESULTS
eight genomic dna samples from  <dig> individuals  were used. all samples were processed in the same manner except sample a <dig>  which was not indexed, but was partitioned and sequenced as a uniplex. samples a <dig> and b <dig> were indexed, pooled, partitioned and sequenced as a duplex. samples a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig> and e <dig> were indexed, pooled, partitioned and sequenced as a pentaplex. samples a, b and e were taken from male participants and samples c and d were from female participants to allow for the influence of chromosome x copy number on partitioning results. this design allows us to determine  the efficiency of deconvoluting individual samples from a multiplex at duplex and pentaplex levels  sequence consistency between uniplex and multiplex samples and  the effect of multiplex indexing on target enrichment. a schematic representation of sample preparation is shown in figure 1a. barcode indexing was performed with indexing primers from illumina  and geneworks  and genome partitioning was performed using sureselect human chromosome x exome kit .

to test the feasibility and utility of multiplexing individuals for genotyping through genomic partitioning and ngs, we compared the genotyping data of the same individual, in the context of uniplex, duplex, and pentaplex genomic mixes. we prepared genomic dna from white blood cells of five individuals, fragmented the dna, and constructed three adaptor ligated libraries, each for one illumina gaii lane. in one lane, the individual was genotyped as uniplex, in the second, as duplex with another individual, and in the third lane, as pentaplex with four additional individuals. the single individual genomes  were tracked through the inclusion of six mer indices that is unique to each individual.

sequence generation and processing was performed on the illumina gaii platform using illumina pipeline . sequencing was performed as  <dig> bp single-end reads. sequences were aligned to the hg <dig> reference genome using the bwa aligner   <cit> . resulting files were modified with the picard toolkit  <cit>  before snp analysis was undertaken using genome analysis toolkit . a comprehensive description of library preparation, target enrichment and bioinformatics is provided in the materials and methods section of this paper.

analysis of the uniplex data  shows  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences across the human genome. of these, 26% of sequences were mapped to the x chromosome. the baits for target enrichment were designed for exons within the x chromosome totalling  <dig>  mb. 88% of sequence reads map on or within  <dig> bp of targeted exons. this represents 97-fold enrichment of the x chromosome exons . an example of tiled sequence aligning to x chromosome exons is shown in figure 1b. the genome browser clearly shows the vast over-representation of reads from the genome that span the target areas and low "background" reads outside of these areas.  <dig>  snps were discovered on the x chromosome,  <dig>   of these were found to be previously annotated on dbsnp and  <dig> were novel snps . we used a gatk confidence parameter of  <dig>  which minimises the discovery of the false positives, yet retains identification of novel snps. the parameter was chosen by comparing the converging plots of total number of snps detected and the proportion of these annotated on dbsnp . with increasing stringency the two plots tend toward parallel with the difference comprising novel snps. all plots were similar, a representative plot is shown .

* calculations performed using confidence parameter of  <dig> in gatk.

duplex data  were split by index barcode and analysed independently. for sample a <dig>  there were  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences across the human genome. of these, 37% of sequences were mapped to the x chromosome, of these 91% of sequence reads map on or within  <dig> bp of targeted exons. this represents 170-fold enrichment of the x chromosome exons .  <dig>  snps were discovered on the x chromosome. of these,  <dig>  were found to be previously annotated on dbsnp and  <dig> were novel snps . for sample b <dig>  there were  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences across the human genome. of these, 23% of sequences were mapped to the x chromosome, 87% of these mapped on or within  <dig> bp of targeted exons. this represents 85-fold enrichment of the x chromosome exons .  <dig>  snps were discovered on the x chromosome. of these,  <dig>   were found to be previously annotated on dbsnp and  <dig> were novel snps . the discrepancy between the two individual samples within the duplex is attributable to quantification error. this technique is sensitive to quantification which can, in turn, affect the accuracy of equimolar pooling of multiplexed samples. we employed nanodrop quantification to determine individual library concentrations however, picogreen-based quantification would be more effective at this critical point.

pentaplex data  were split by index barcode and analysed independently. for individual samples, there was a median of  <dig> , <dig> ±  <dig>  unique sequences across the human genome. of these,  <dig> ± 10% of sequences were mapped to the x chromosome, of these  <dig> ±  <dig> % of sequence reads map on or within  <dig> bp of targeted exons. this represents an average 263-fold enrichment of the x chromosome exons for each of the  <dig> individual samples in the pentaplex .  <dig>  ±  <dig> snps were discovered on the x chromosome. of these,  <dig>  ±  <dig> were found to be previously annotated on dbsnp and  <dig> ±  <dig> were novel snps . for sample a and b, which were genotyped three and two times, respectively, we found  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> snps, respectively.

we found that the overall depth of read across all targeted bases was comparable between the uniplex and pentaplex versions of individual a . although deeper read depth provides higher confidence in snp calling, our read depth across all samples was ~16x, which is adequate for the gatk algorithm to confidently call variant genotypes in the sample at a confidence interval of  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
our work benchmarks the use of a new target enrichment technology combined with a barcode indexing method with the aim of reducing the time and costs associated with ngs platforms. we have demonstrated the ability to genotype five individuals across a  <dig>  mb targeted region with confidence that we would detect the majority of the snps within the targeted region. furthermore, we have shown that the sequencing depth obtained is adequate for credible snp genotyping analysis at uniplex, duplex and pentaplex levels.

our experiments describe re-sequencing of discontiguous exons where we observed that coverage per base was reduced at the flanks and increased at the middle of the sequenced regions . sequencing of contiguous regions, or larger blocks of discontiguous regions, would increase the average read depth across all samples. additionally, with the introduction of high capacity sequencing technologies such as illumina hi seq™, the read depth per multiplexed sample will increase dramatically providing higher confidence in snp calling and the potential to increase plexity when read depth exceeds that required for confident genotyping. the successful demonstration of this methodology may facilitate the efficient identification of key genetic variants in disease linked loci.
