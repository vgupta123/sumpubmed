BACKGROUND
biochemical analysis of protein phosphatase activity led to the identification of distinct enzyme classes based on sensitivity to inhibitors, in vitro substrate specificity and cation requirements. type  <dig> protein phosphatase  is one of the major serine/threonine phosphatase classes found in all eukaryotic cells. cloning of the catalytic subunits of pp <dig>  revealed that there are distinct enzyme forms which had not been distinguished biochemically. phylogenetic analysis has revealed that there is an evolutionarily conserved distinction between animal pp1α  and pp1β  implying that the gene products have distinct biological functions despite their identical biochemical properties in vitro and >85% sequence identity  <cit> . in drosophila larvae, pp1α87b provides 80% of the total pp <dig> catalytic activity  <cit> , with 10% each being attributed to pp1α96a and pp1β9c  <cit> . pp1α87b and pp1β9c are both essential for viability, however pp1α96a and pp1α13c are dispensable  <cit> .

pp <dig> has numerous diverse functions within the cell including regulation of cell cycle, cytoskeleton, transcription and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . while, in vitro, the catalytic subunit  dephosphorylates a wide variety of substrates, the enzyme in vivo is found in a variety of complexes with different protein partners  <cit> . these pp <dig> interacting proteins target pp1c to specific subcellular locations, and modulate its activity towards different substrates. when complexed to a regulatory subunit, pp1c becomes much less promiscuous in its activity, so genuine pp <dig> interacting proteins tend to inhibit pp1c activity in standard in vitro assays , even though their in vivo role is to promote pp1c's activity towards a specific substrate. at least  <dig> pp1c targeting subunits have now been described, including the g-subunit, that targets pp1c to glycogen particles, the m-subunit that targets pp1c to myosin, and sara that targets pp1c to the tgfβ receptor  <cit> .

the three human pp1c isozymes localise to different subcellular regions in both mitotically active cells and in terminally differentiated cells  <cit> . this suggests that there are targeting subunits that differentiate between the pp1c proteins. so far, mammalian neurabin i and neurabin ii/spinophilin, have been shown to selectively co-precipitate with mammalian pp1γ and pp1α in preference to pp1β  <cit> . repo-man has a modest  preference for pp1γ over pp1α, however the ability of repo-man to distinguish between pp1γ and pp1β has not been reported  <cit> . recent co-immunoprecipitation assays have identified a few more mammalian isozyme specific pp1-interacting proteins  <cit> . in drosophila, one pp1β-specific binding protein has been described, mypt-75d; this probably is important for mediating the single essential function of pp1β in flies, which is regulation of non-muscle myosin  <cit> . no drosophila proteins with a preference for binding pp1α rather than pp1β have been described.

uri  has been implicated in modulation of the transcriptional response to nutritional cues in humans and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . uri mutant s. cerevisiae are viable, but constitutively over-express genes important for amino acid metabolism. c. elegans uri- <dig> mutant animals are also viable, but have defects in germ cell proliferation and dna stability  <cit> . human rmp  is identical to uri, except that the clone described lacks the n-terminal 25aa. rmp was identified through its ability to bind the rpb <dig> subunit of rna polymerase, and was demonstrated to have weak transcriptional co-repressor activity  <cit> . uri  has also been named nnx <dig>  <cit> . here we present a functional analysis of the drosophila uri gene.

RESULTS
uri is a pp1α specific binding protein
to identify potential regulatory subunits of the major protein phosphatase catalytic subunit of drosophila we screened a yeast two-hybrid library using drosophila pp1α87b as a bait and isolated  <dig> cdnas representing  <dig> different genes. one of these genes  was represented by  <dig> independent clones. cg <dig> has been described as the drosophila homologue of uri since the n-terminal region  contains a prefoldin domain, most similar to that of human uri , and the c-terminus contains a short region of homology termed the uri-box  . the uri predicted transcript encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig> kda, although the protein runs at  <dig> kda in sds page, and an isoelectric point  of  <dig> . two coiled coil domains outside the prefoldin domain are predicted . human uri does not contain additional coiled-coil regions, but c. elegans uri- <dig> does. the overall acidity of the protein is partly explained by a very acidic region at aa 170– <dig>  human uri also has an acidic domain, as does worm uri- <dig>  drosophila uri has three putative pp1c binding motifs   <cit>  at amino acids  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , , while human uri and worm uri- <dig> each contain one pp1c binding motif  at the end of the prefoldin domain. drosophila uri contains four predicted nuclear localisation signals  ; both human uri and worm uri- <dig> have two nlss. the c-terminal region of drosophila uri contains a repeat sequence  that shows no homology to the uri proteins from other species, or to any other protein sequence in the database .

the drosophila pp1c genes encode proteins that are >85% identical to each other and have indistinguishable activities in vitro. nevertheless, pp1β9c is structurally distinct from the pp1α isozymes and is encoded by an essential gene  <cit> , suggesting some binding partners can distinguish between pp1c isozymes. although uri was isolated in our small scale pp1α87b yeast two-hybrid screen, no uri clones were isolated in a 10-fold larger scale screen from the same library using pp1β9c as a bait  <cit> , suggesting that uri may be a pp1α-specific binding protein. we directly tested this in yeast two-hybrid, and found that uri was able to bind all three pp1α forms, but was unable to interact with pp1β9c .

pp1c dephosphorylates a wide range of substrates in vitro; substrate specificity in vivo is provided by targeting subunits. addition of a pp <dig> targeting subunit will typically alter substrate specificity in the in vitro reaction, and therefore inhibit the ability of pp1c to dephosphorylate a wide variety of phosphosubstrates. we tested the ability of uri to inhibit the myelin basic protein  phosphatase activities of recombinant pp1α87b and pp1β9c. bacterially expressed uri inhibited the pp1α87b mbp phosphatase activity with higher affinity than the pp1β9c mbp phosphatase activity. the uri ic <dig> against pp1α87b was about 25-fold lower than that of uri against pp1β9c . no antibodies have been produced that can distinguish between the drosophila pp <dig> proteins, so, to test the interaction between uri and pp1α and pp1β in vivo, we ectopically expressed ha-tagged pp1α87b and pp1β9c proteins in flies, and tested their ability to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous uri. arm-gal <dig>  <cit>  flies have low-level ubiquitous expression of the yeast transcription factor gal4p, which activates expression of transgenes under the control of the gal4p target site, uas. immunoprecipitation of cell lysates of arm-gal4; uas-ha-pp1α87b and arm-gal4; uas-ha-pp1β9c flies with anti-uri antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-ha antibodies, showed that ha-pp1α87b co-precipitated more efficiently with uri than did ha-pp1β9c , consistent with pp1c activity assay data. the reciprocal experiment, immuno-precipitation with anti-ha antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-uri antibodies confirmed this difference in the strength of the interactions . therefore uri is the first drosophila pp1c interacting protein to be shown to interact with pp1α with significantly higher affinity than with pp1β.

since human uri also contains a predicted pp1c binding motif we investigated its ability bind different human pp1c isozymes. flag-tagged uri/rmp was transiently expressed in cos  <dig> tissue culture cells along with v5-tagged human pp1α or pp1β; pp1α was expressed more strongly in these experiments than pp1β. immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-flag antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-v <dig> antibodies showed that human pp1α co-precipitated efficiently with the human uri. co-immunoprecipitation of pp1β and flag-tagged uri/rmp was not detected . a deletion construct of human uri/rmp  has been reported  <cit> , the region of uri/rmp included in this construct is indicated by the bracket below the human protein in figure  <dig>  the putative pp <dig> binding sites in uri/rmp are missing in this deletion derivative. we found no co-immunoprecipitation between either of the pp <dig> isozymes and uri/rmp-d <dig>  this consistent with the notion that the rvef putative pp <dig> binding site on uri is important for the uri-pp1c association, although other sites missing in the truncated protein could also be implicated in the interaction. drosophila uri could also bind mammalian pp1α with higher affinity then pp1β when they were co-expressed in mammalian tissue culture . therefore, despite low overall sequence homology, the ability of uri to discriminate between different pp1c isozymes is evolutionarily conserved.

uri protein is predominantly cytoplasmic
human uri is an rpb <dig> binding protein  <cit> . this interaction, along with the predicted nuclear localisation sequence and the known role for human uri in transcriptional regulation, would predict that at least some uri protein should be nuclear and chromatin associated. to test this, we transiently expressed flag-tagged drosophila uri, human uri/rmp and uri/rmp-d <dig> and visualised their localisation by immunofluorescence. uri/rmp-d <dig> lacks the prefoldin domain but retains the ability to bind rpb <dig> in cos <dig> mammalian tissue culture cells  <cit> . we found that uri  and uri/rmp  proteins were predominantly cytoplasmic with perinuclear localisation . this is consistent with the cytoplasmic localisation for the n-terminally deleted nnx <dig> clone of uri/rmp  <cit> . when uri/rmp-d <dig> was expressed, strong nuclear localisation of the protein was observed , indicating that the regions deleted from this construct are important for regulation of the nuclear localisation of uri protein. human uri/rmp has been shown to bind dmap <dig>  a dna methyltransferase- <dig> associated protein implicated in gene silencing, and this interaction promotes the nuclear re-localisation of uri/rmp  <cit> . to test whether the interaction between uri and pp <dig> similarly altered the subcellular localisation of either protein, we co-expressed drosophila uri with pp1α87b in cos <dig> cells. pp1α87b, when expressed alone, can be detected in the cytoplasm, but is primarily nuclear . when pp1α87b was co-expressed with uri, both proteins were more abundant in the cytoplasm; both the nuclear accumulation of pp1α87b and the perinuclear accumulation of uri was lost .

uri is expressed throughout development, but is most abundant during embryogenesis, pupariation, and in adult gonads
we examined the developmental protein expression profile by western blotting and found uri protein to be most abundant in early embryos and pupae. the protein could not be detected in extracts of whole adult flies, or adults lacking gonads, however uri was detected in extracts of ovaries and testes . to determine the cellular and tissue distribution of uri transcription we used rna in situ hybridisation. uri mrna expression was uniform in embryos, imaginal discs, and larval brains . in testes, uri was expressed in mitotically proliferating spermatogonia and in early primary spermatocytes, with staining levels decreasing as spermatocytes matured . no transcripts were detected in post-meiotic stages. male germline stem cells may express low levels of the mrna.

uri protein is in cytoplasmic speckles in vivo
examination of protein subcellular localisations after ectopic expression can be complicated by artefacts associated with saturating the normal localisation machinery. therefore we examined the subcellular distribution of endogenous drosophila uri, using the anti-uri antibody, in tissues in which we know from western blotting there are significant levels of uri protein. in wild type primary spermatocytes , and maturing spermatids  uri was found throughout the cytoplasm, with a distinctive concentration in small speckles . no specific localisation to the nucleus was apparent. persistence of uri into post-meiotic stages indicates that it has a long half life, as no transcript was detected at this stage. to test whether the localisation in testis is simply an oddity of this tissue we examined uri localisation in salivary glands and embryos. in salivary gland uri was predominantly cytoplasmic, with a mild perinuclear accumulation . in embryos we also found that uri protein in interphase cells is primarily cytoplasmic, and some protein was in speckles in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the speckles and uniform staining persisted in mitotic cells, and no localisation to condensed chromosomes was found .

uri protein is associated with transcriptionally active regions of polytene chromosomes
although the majority of endogenous drosophila uri protein is cytoplasmic, the published interactions between uri homologues and rna polymerase ii suggested that at least some uri protein would be associated with chromatin. we examined the localisation of uri on spreads of larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes and found that uri stains numerous discrete bands. only chromatin associated proteins are preserved for staining in these spread preparations, explaining the discrepancy between the chromatin localisation seen in spreads and the cytoplasmic localisation seen in whole mount. co-labelling with an antibody recognising active rna polymerase ii revealed that the majority of the uri positive bands are sites of active transcription . drosophila larvae, when stressed by heat shock, shut off most transcription and only actively transcribe from the heat shock response loci. this is associated with re-localisation of rna polymerase ii to a small number of heat-shock induced puffs on the polytene chromosomes  <cit> . we found that uri also relocated to the heat shock puffs, and was lost from the remainder of the polytene chromosomes, on heat shock treatment . therefore, although most uri protein is cytoplasmic in salivary gland cells, some is nuclear, and associated on chromatin with sites of active transcription.

uri is essential for viability in drosophila
mutation of c. elegans uri- <dig> leads to sterility as well as multiple and variable somatic defects  <cit> . the budding yeast uri deletion strain is viable, but defective for expression of genes in the nutrient response pathway  <cit> . to determine the requirement for uri in drosophila somatic and germ-line development we isolated loss of function mutant alleles. searches of extant p-element insertion lines revealed that p{gsv6}gs <dig>  from the drosophila gene search project  <cit>  was inserted  <dig> bp 5' of the annotated uri transcription start; we named this allele uri <dig>  as the annotated 5' utr was very short , we used rt-pcr with primers upstream of this site to delimit the actual 5' end of the gene, and found that uri transcription started 112– <dig> bp upstream of the annotated transcription start. therefore the uri <dig> insertion is within the 5' utr of uri,  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start site .

the uri <dig> chromosome was homozygous lethal, however uri1/dfpx <dig> males and females were viable, fertile, and did not exhibit a detectable phenotype px <dig> deletes the uri locus). thus the lethality of the uri <dig> chromosome was due to one or more second-site lethal mutations. p-element insertions in promoters or 5' utrs often down-regulate transcription of the respective gene. using rt-pcr designed against a region 3' of the uri <dig> insertion, we found that there was considerably less uri transcript in uri1/uri <dig> compared to uri1/cyo, act-gfp first instar larvae, showing that the p element in uri does indeed down-regulate uri transcription . to generate stronger loss of function mutant alleles, we screened for deletions caused by imprecise excision of the uri <dig> p-element and found nine that specifically disrupted uri. these deletions varied in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. we selected uri110b for further analysis as it has the largest deletion, removing the translation start, exon  <dig> and most of exon  <dig> . the second site lethal mutation from the original chromosome was separated from the uri110b allele by meiotic recombination. although uri110b deletes a significant proportion of the uri gene, we found that a transcript annealing most of the 5' utr to the final  <dig> bp of the wild type transcript is expressed in uri110b mutant embryos. two possible peptides encoded by this mutant transcript are shown .

uri is required for full expression of some genes in embryos
uri110b homozygote embryos hatch normally, as do uri110b/dfpx <dig> embryos. the mutant first instar larvae appeared sick, for example showing very little locomotion or feeding activity, and died soon after hatching. to determine whether this lethality could be attributed to defects in transcriptional activity we used rt-pcr to compare expression levels of several genes in mutant vs heterozygous sibling embryos. we chose to analyse expression of ebony, cg <dig> and cg <dig>  the drosophila homologues of s. cerevisiae lys <dig>  gcv <dig> and arg <dig> respectively, which were shown to be regulated by scuri  <cit> . expression of ebony and cg <dig> was significantly and reproducibly lower in mutant embryos than wild type embryos, while expression of cg <dig> was slightly elevated, or not altered in the mutant background . selection of a control gene in these experiments is not straightforward, standard choices such as a ribosomal protein are not necessarily appropriate when signalling downstream of tor, which regulates growth and metabolism, could be affected. as a control we chose pp1β9c, which we had no reason to expect to change. over several experiments expression of pp1β9c was somewhat variable between in mutant vs wild type, but there was never more than a 2-fold difference in expression of this gene in the two conditions. drosophila uri is therefore essential for normal expression of at least two  target genes in embryos, but is not required for the expression of all genes.

uri is required for cell viability in the germline
expression of his-myc tagged uri was able to partially rescue the uri110b/dfpx <dig> lethality, so that flies of the genotype uas-hm-uri, uri110b/arm-gall <dig>  dfpx <dig> were mostly late pupal lethal, with approximately 2% adult survivors. the surviving adults had weak locomotory ability and activity, and died within  <dig> hours. nearly all of them exhibited additional wing vein material along the wing veins l <dig>  l <dig>  and l5; some pharate adults had small eyes. we found that expression of a hairpin uri rnai construct in the eye imaginal disc gave a similar small eye phenotype . we confirmed the absence of full length uri protein in uri110b with western blotting on wing disc samples from uas-hm-uri, uri110b/arm-gal <dig>  dfpx <dig> third instar larvae .

uri protein is apparently gonad specific in adults , we therefore wanted to examine the mutant phenotype in ovaries and testes. uas-hm-uri is a p{uast} derivative which does not express in the female germ-line  <cit> , while arm-gal <dig> does not express efficiently in the male germline. this lack of germline expression means that the uas-hm-uri, uri110b/arm-gal <dig>  dfpx <dig> are essentially only rescued in the soma, allowing us to analyse the requirement for uri in the germline. these animals are developmentally delayed compared to wild-type, so their gonads had later stages of spermatogenesis or oogenesis than age matched controls.

testes from uri somatically-rescued males were much smaller than their wild type counterparts . the testes contained a few apparently normal spermatogonia and spermatocytes  as well as some elongated spermatids. post-meiotic spermatids usually had abnormal morphology, although some testes contained a small number of normal motile sperm . in addition to the healthy cells, mutant testes were full of dying cells and debris from dead cells . we were able to partially rescue the testis phenotype of somatically rescued uri110b/dfpx <dig> mutants by additional expression of uri in late spermatogonia and spermatocytes using the bam-gal4-vp <dig> driver  <cit> . these pharate adult males had longer testes than those lacking the germline expression ; the testes contained many later stages of spermiogenesis, and numerous motile sperm . they were however not fully rescued, as they contained only a few cysts of spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and post-meiotic spermatids were located much closer to the apical tip of the testis than is normal .

the ovarioles in ovaries of wild type pharate adult females typically have a germarium and three egg chambers, the oldest of which is at about stage  <dig> of oogenesis. ovaries from uri somatically-rescued pharate adult females were small, and the germaria of these ovaries were thinner than wild type . most ovarioles lacked well defined stage  <dig> and later egg chambers, although one or two apparently normal later stage  egg chambers were present in most ovaries.

uri mutant cells contain damaged dna
c. elegans uri- <dig> mutants, while viable, were sterile due to germline proliferation failures caused by loss of dna integrity. to test whether the drosophila uri gene also has a role in dna maintenance we examined testes of somatically rescued uri110b male larvae using tunel labelling. as a positive control we treated wild type testes samples with dnase to induce dna breaks, while untreated wild type testes served as a negative control. we observed high levels of tunel labelling of dna in uri somatically rescued testes, indicating that these cells contained damaged dna . the most mature primary spermatocytes showed lower levels of tunel labelling. negative control testes showed only background tunel labelling in the cytoplasm . we also saw elevated levels of tunel labelling in somatic tissues, for example in fat body, from these larvae, consistent with their low viability to adulthood .

discussion
s. cerevisiae scuri  mutants have defects in bud site selection and in the transcriptional response downstream of tor  signalling  <cit> . sirna mediated depletion of uri also led to tor response defects in human tissue culture cells  <cit> . c. elegans uri- <dig> mutants, while viable, had pleiotropic developmental defects and were sterile due to germline proliferation failures caused by loss of dna integrity  <cit> . these apparently unconnected phenotypes suggest that uri is involved in multiple processes, making a strong case for its further characterisation.

numerous lines of evidence implicate uri in transcriptional regulation. both human and yeast uri proteins function as weak transcriptional repressors; scuri is also a context dependent activator  <cit> . yeast uri  also binds to gis1p's jmjc  domain  <cit> . human rmp  was identified as a binding partner of rbp <dig>  an rna polymerase subunit. consistent with this, we found that a fraction of endogenous uri protein is associated with sites of active transcription on salivary polytene chromosomes and this association was maintained as the transcriptional profile changed in response to heat shock. this is consistent with a role for uri in general transcriptional activation rather than repression.

given the chromatin functions of uri-containing complexes it is surprising that endogenous uri is predominantly cytoplasmic. the uri/rmp prefoldin domain c-terminal half, with a predicted coiled-coil structure, acts as a cytoplasmic anchor in human cells  <cit> . this region interacts with dna methyltransferase 1-associating protein, and this interaction promotes nuclear re-localisation. the putative pp1c interacting motif of the human protein also resides at the prefoldin domain c-terminus. over-expression of drosophila uri prevented nuclear accumulation of co-expressed pp1α, indicating that pp <dig> does not promote uri nuclear localisation . when ectopically expressed in human tissue culture cells, drosophila uri and human uri showed a perinuclear accumulation, this was also seen in salivary glands in vivo. in other cells, most obviously spermatocytes, uri localised to cytoplasmic speckles. we are unsure what organelle or subcellular structures are associated with uri speckles, although the speckles do not co-localise with the golgi apparatus, or with p-bodies, which have similar speckled cytoplasmic localisation patterns in spermatocytes .

since both scuri and human uri have been implicated in tor signalling we examined expression in uri null embryos of drosophila homologues of genes downstream of scuri. two of the genes tested, cg <dig> and ebony were reproducibly expressed at lower levels in mutant embryos. thus, in contrast to the yeast situation, uri is required for full expression of these genes. tor signalling in drosophila is important for larval growth; mutant larvae grow slowly, but live for up to  <dig> days  <cit> . uri110b larvae die soon after hatching and are not developmentally delayed, indicating that, although uri may be implicated in regulation of tor target genes, it probably has a wider range of target genes and/or other cellular functions. further examination of the transcript profiles in mutant animals, for example by microarray analysis, would reveal the full extent of the transcriptional defect in uri mutant larvae. human uri was isolated in a complex that also contained tip <dig>  tip <dig>  rbp <dig> and several small prefoldin domain proteins  <cit> . like uri, drosophila tip <dig>  and tip <dig>  mutant die as first instar larvae with no obvious defects  <cit> , so uri lethality could potentially be attributable to defects in a complex containing these atpases.

uri protein is most abundant in embryos, pupae and in adult gonads; where expression is higher in germline than soma. this germline enrichment of fly uri correlated well with the sterility phenotype in worms, and led us to investigate uri's role in gonads in more detail. partial somatic rescue of uri mutant flies enabled us to analyse the cell autonomous germline role, and revealed strong effects in both males and females. in both sexes the major defect was reduced cell viability. spermatogenesis in flies is maintained by a population of stem cells, which give rise to spermatogonia. defects in stem cell self renewal or survival eventually lead to empty  testes, as stem cells are not maintained. similarly, defects in spermatogonial survival lead to extremely small testes, as only stem cells remain. the somatically rescued uri male phenotype is consistent with loss of stem or early spermatogonial cells. the testes were mostly filled with dead or dying cells, indicating that uri is required for cell viability. very few late spermatids were found, although we could occasionally see motile sperm. these would have initiated spermatogenesis in early larvae, and may have been saved by perdurance of maternally provided uri protein. provision of uri to the germline using bam-gal4-vp <dig>  which expresses in late spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, partially rescued the testis phenotype. many more later stages of spermatogenesis were seen, indicating that uri is required for the viability of late spermatogonia and spermatocytes. testes rescued by expression of uri with bam-gal4-vp <dig> had fewer early spermatogonia than wild type testes. the inefficient rescue of these cells show that uri is required in all spermatogonia, and possibly also in germline stem cells, to maintain cell viability. the rna in situ confirms that uri is most highly expressed in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes. somatically rescued uri females had thinner germaria than wild type, and mostly lacked later oogenesis stages.

c. elegans uri- <dig> is important to maintain dna stability in the worm germline. by analogy with worms, the cell death could be due to accumulation of dna damage; it could also be due to transcriptional defects, as uri is required for transcription. we established that uri mutants have defects in maintenance of dna integrity, as shown by tunel staining. this is in complete agreement with the c. elegans findings. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that primary defects in transcriptional regulation lead to the dna damage phenotype as a secondary effect.

most pp1c interacting proteins do not discriminate between pp1α and pp1β isozymes. mypt-75d was the first drosophila protein to show differential binding, having higher affinity to pp1β than pp1α. this specificity is linked to the essential role of pp1β in flies – non-muscle myosin regulation  <cit> . uri is the first drosophila protein to be demonstrated to have a strong preference for pp1α over pp1β. an essential, non-redundant function for pp1α is suggested by inability of pp1β to rescue pp1α mutants  <cit> . lethality of uri mutants supports the notion that pp1α has a role that cannot be supplied by pp1β. uri can bind all the drosophila pp1α isozymes, and indeed was identified as a pp1α96a putative interacting protein in a large scale yeast two-hybrid screen  <cit> . canonical pp1c binding sites in human and worm uri suggested that binding to pp <dig> was probably conserved for this protein. we confirmed the human uri-pp1c interaction directly, adding uri to the ever-growing list of pp1c binding proteins. more excitingly, we show that interaction with pp1α in preference to pp1β is conserved between fly and mammalian uri.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have shown that drosophila uri, is an essential pp1α-specific binding protein. using genetic and biochemical analyses we implicate uri in regulation of transcription, germ-line and somatic cell viability and maintenance of dna integrity.
