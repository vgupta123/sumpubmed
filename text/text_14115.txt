BACKGROUND
in the united states, enteric methane emissions from ruminants are the second largest anthropogenic source of methane, contributing to  <dig>  % of all methane emissions and global warming  <cit> . methane production caused by rumen archaea  leads to a 2–12 % net loss of the dairy cow’s gross energy intake  <cit> . this loss contributes to a significant economic loss for farmers as it increases the quantity of feed needed to meet milk production demands.

the rumen is an anaerobic environment that houses a microbiome consisting of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, phages, and archaea. the bacteria, protozoa, and fungi  ferment feedstuff consumed by the host, and produce vfa. acetate, butyrate, and propionate, the predominant vfa in the rumen, are the main energy sources for the host animal. fermentation byproducts such as carbon dioxide, formate, hydrogen gas, methanol, and methylamines are used by methanogenic archaea for methane production. the majority of the methane is eructated and exhaled out by the ruminant into the environment. for methane mitigation strategies to be successful, it is important to identify factors that may influence the rumen environment and thus, affect the methanogen density and diversity.

in dairy cattle rumen digesta, methanogens belonging to the genus methanobrevibacter  are the most abundant species and primarily use hydrogen and carbon dioxide as substrates for methanogenesis . methanogens from the genera methanosphaera  and methanosarcina use methanol and methylamines as substrates and are less abundant in the rumen  <cit> . most mbr. species in the rumen branch into two taxonomic clades, consisting of mbr. smithii, mbr. gottschalkii, mbr. millerae, and mbr. thaueri  clade), or mbr. ruminantium and mbr. olleyae  clade)  <cit> . previous 16s rrna gene sequence clone library data suggest that dairy breed influences the ro and sgmt clade distributions in the rumen  <cit> .

holstein and jersey dairy cattle are the two most common dairy breeds used in the united states. holstein cows are recognized for their high milk production, whereas jersey cows are recognized for their increased fertility and higher milk components. additionally, there is global interest in holstein-jersey crossbreeds to compensate for the decreased fertility in holsteins and milk production in jersey cows. it has been demonstrated that first generation holstein-jersey crosses have dry matter intakes, milk yields and solids in between those measured in holstein and jersey cows, respectively  <cit> .

the transition period from a diet high in neutral detergent fiber  to a diet high in starch is a challenge for lactating dairy cattle. prior to parturition, the ndf content in the diet is elevated, while after parturition the energy content is increased with higher starch and fat levels. kumar et al.  <cit>  showed no difference in archaeal shannon diversity or taxa when cows were transitioned from a high-fiber pre-partum diet to a low-fiber post-partum diet, however, no studies described the rumen methanogen community across a lactation period. when quantifying vfa, another study observed that concentrations of total vfa, acetate, and propionate were decreased during the transition period in comparison to 100 days in milk   <cit> .

previous research focused on rumen bacteria in pre- and post-partum dairy cattle, but rumen methanogens have not been identified or quantified under these conditions. furthermore, the rumen methanogens of holstein and jersey dairy cattle with different parities and dim were identified with limited data generated from pooled pcr samples using clone libraries. the present study focused on holstein-jersey crossbreeds, used next-generation sequencing , and animals of the same age, dim, and parity. given previous investigations into the rumen methanogen community in relation to breed and what is known about transitioning dairy cattle from one diet to another, we hypothesized that the rumen methanogen diversity and rumen vfa proportions in primiparous dairy cattle are affected by both breed and dim, while methanogen densities do not vary. the objectives of the present study were to  measure the rumen vfa,  use ngs techniques to identify rumen methanogens,  distribute the archaeal 16s rrna gene sequence reads into operational taxonomic units ,  quantify the rumen methanogens, and  correlate vfa with specific rumen methanogen taxa from each breed during early , peak , mid- , and late-lactation .

all sequence reads belonged to the phylum euryarchaeota. the sgmt and ro clades did not differ by breed or dim . the majority of the total sequences reads were related to four methanogen species, mbr. smithii, mbr. thaueri, mbr. ruminantium, and mbr. millerae . because there was a significant interaction between breed and dim for mbr. thaueri, mbr. millerae, methanosphaera, and methanoplasmatales, breed differences at specific dim are presented. at  <dig> dim, the mean % abundance of mbr. thaueri was lower in jerseys  and higher in holsteins  and holstein-jersey crossbreeds  . at  <dig> dim, a lower abundance of the species mbr. thaueri was observed in holsteins  and holstein-jersey crossbreeds  when compared to jerseys . the species, mbr. ruminantium  was higher at  <dig> dim than at  <dig> dim. . the less abundant methanogen species  mbr. gottschalkii and mbr. woesei also varied by dim, but not by breed. at  <dig> dim  and  <dig> dim , the abundance of mbr. gottschalkii was higher than at  <dig> dim. mbr. woesei  were more abundant at  <dig> dim, whereas the order methanosarcinales was more abundant at  <dig> dim . less than 1 % of total methanogen sequences were distantly related to the following methanogen genera: methanoculleus, methanolobus methanoplanus, methanospirillium, and methanosarcina.table  <dig> classification of rumen methanogen 16s rrna sequence reads to taxa from holstein, jersey, holstein-jersey crossbreed dairy cows at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 273 days in milk

discussion
the present study is the first to investigate the rumen methanogen community across a lactation period in three dairy cattle breeds. the purpose of this experiment was to provide more knowledge about the rumen methanogen community and rumen parameters at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dim in holstein, jersey, and holstein-jersey crossbreeds. this study identified the core methanogen community with ngs technologies, quantified rumen vfa and methanogen densities, and correlated rumen methanogen species to one another and to vfa.

volatile fatty acids
vfa are the main energy source provided to lactating dairy cattle and are the by products of carbohydrate fermentation by rumen bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. generally, propionate is a precursor to glucose and is increased when animals are provided a high-starch diet or provided the ionophore, monensin. relative to  <dig> and  <dig> dim, proportions of propionate were increased at  <dig> and  <dig> dim, suggesting a greater demand for glucose by the cow during early lactation. although the animals were provided  <dig>  % monensin pre-partum versus  <dig>  % post-partum, it is not possible to correlate the increase in propionate at  <dig> and  <dig> dim with this additive. an effect from monensin would be more plausible at  <dig> dim, when the cows were transitioning from a pre-partum to a post-partum diet, but this would not explain why propionate was also increased at  <dig> dim.

furthermore, the increase in total vfa concentrations observed at  <dig> dim suggests an increase in carbohydrate fermentation at the start of lactation. johnson et al.  <cit>  stated that the fermentation of fiber is favored, providing insight into why vfa concentrations were elevated at  <dig> dim versus  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dim. in contrast, danielsson et al.  <cit>  found that total vfa concentrations did not vary in cannulated mid-lactation dairy cattle consuming 500: <dig> and 900:100 g/kg dry matter forage to concentration diets.

the present study is the first to compare the methanogen densities in three breeds of dairy cattle and by dim. in agreement with our hypothesis, the methanogen densities did not vary by breed or dim. previously reported methanogen densities  from bulls on high-fiber  and starch diets   <cit>  were higher than what was observed in our study  <cit> . however, differences between the methanogen densities were not observed between the two diet groups  <cit> . in a study by zhou et al.  <cit> , the use of an exogenous fibrolytic feed enzyme additive did not affect the methanogen densities, yet, affected the methanogen community and methane production of lactating holstein cows. therefore, it appears that methanogen densities are not markedly affected by these specific diet alterations.

previous work in dairy  <cit>  and beef cattle  <cit>  also showed the genus mbr to be the most predominant genus. as methanogens belonging to the genus mbr use the rumen fermentation byproducts, such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide as substrates for methanogenesis, it is thought that the high levels of these byproducts in the rumen enable these methanogens to thrive over other species that rely on scarce substrates such as methylamines, methanol, or acetate  <cit> .

although mbr is the most abundant archaeal genus in ruminants, there are several species that are distributed into two different phylogenetic clades . in the present study, the sgmt clade was the most dominant branch by breed and dim. both mbr. smithii and mbr. thaueri made up the majority of the sgmt clade, while mbr. ruminantium made up the majority of the ro clade. previous research, using the same archaeal forward primer , suggested a difference between sgmt-ro clade distributions between holstein and jersey cows  <cit> . however, the study revealed several limitations in the interpretation of the results. animals were not blocked by parity, dim, or age, the pcr products were pooled by breed and a clone library was constructed for each breed, and a limited number of clones were sequenced. it is conceivable that these variables, but not primer bias, may have contributed to the observed breed differences. another study showed a prevalence of the ro clade in both corn-fed hereford crossbreed and potato-fed hereford feedlot cattle in canada  <cit> . finally, the present study showed a strong negative correlation between the two clades suggesting that ruminants possess either a high abundance of sgmt or of ro and that dairy breed and dim do not impact these proportions.

because the four methanogen species mbr. smithii, mbr. thaueri, mbr. ruminantium, and mbr. millerae were identified in each breed and at each dim time point investigated, our data showed the presence of a core methanogen community. jeyanathan et al.  <cit>  identified a common methanogen community between holstein-jersey crossbreeds, sheep, and red deer. finding a core rumen methanogen community will enable further investigations into targeting specific species that are key contributors to methane production. future work could isolate these species and determine which species produce the most methane.

three out of the four methanogen species in the present study were previously identified in both holstein and jersey cows, while mbr. thaueri was not. recently, mbr. thaueri was identified with the same primer pair used in the present study, at a high abundance in wild impalas from south africa  <cit> . omission of mbr. thaueri from previous studies could be due to lack of sequencing depth or diet of the animal. the higher abundance of mbr. thaueri in jersey cows at  <dig> dim  may be a result of a higher dry matter intake , but future studies are needed to draw a clear link between dmi, milk yield, and the rumen methanogen species identified. it is conceivable that mbr. thaueri and the other three methanogen species persisted because the rumen environment and the substrates created by bacteria, protozoa, and fungi enabled these methanogens to thrive.

throughout the lactation period and by breed, the methanol-utilizing genus, msp. was identified in low abundances. its mean % abundance was highest around peak lactation  and lowest at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dim. similarly, kumar et al.  <cit>  compared the methanogen diversity between holsteins at four weeks before calving and 1– <dig> days after calving and observed no differences in the genera mbr or msp. at 1– <dig> dim, the methanol-utilizing genus msp was more abundant  in primiparous holsteins than those from the present study . like in the present study, animals were stomach tubed 2– <dig> h post-feeding and received a diet before calving with the same ndf content . msp is typically more abundant in animals consuming feeds with elevated pectin levels  <cit> . although not analyzed, it is possible that the diet in the present study had a lower quantity of pectin.

although both otu and 16s rrna gene sequence classifications identified a core methanogen community, certain methanogen species were more abundant at different dim time points. relative to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dim the proportions of mbr. millerae and mbr. woesei were highest at  <dig> dim. while previous research has not focused on rumen methanogen communities pre- and post-partum, one study suggested that the highly cellulolytic anaerobic fungi were more prevalent in pre-partum dairy cows, while rumen protozoa were less prevalent  <cit> . this suggests that as the dairy cows transition to a diet typically fed post-partum, there is a shift in the rumen microbiome and likely in the methanogen community.

the otu coverage in the present study was almost 100 %, indicating a sufficient sampling effort. otu distribution did not vary by breed or dim and the majority of the sequences were distributed into four main otus. the methanogen diversity in the present study was not influenced by breed, but by dim. king et al.  <cit>  reported a higher shannon diversity index and number of otus in lactating holstein cows than in jersey cows. however, the limited number of sequences from the cloned libraries, pooled samples by breed, and parity may have influenced the results. according to kumar et al.  <cit> , multiparous holstein cows exhibit a higher shannon diversity index than primiparous.

the shannon diversity indices  from the present study were highest at  <dig> dim, while the 16s rrna gene sequences reads clustered during this time as well. at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dim the sequence reads were mixed in one cluster. previous research also demonstrated that the shannon diversity indices of methanogens increased in bulls on a high-fiber diet  and decreased with a high-starch diet   <cit> . these data suggested that a high-fiber diet leads to a more diverse methanogen community when compared to a high-starch diet. in another study, the shannon diversity of holsteins at 4 weeks before calving and 1– <dig> days after calving did not differ, but was most likely because there was not enough time between sampling  <cit> . belanche et al.  <cit>  suggested that the increased amount of cellulose and other heteropolysaccharides in a diet high in fiber leads to a more diverse microbial community. therefore, a more diverse bacterial, fungal, or protozoal community may provide different substrates that enable the presence of a more diverse methanogen community.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here are the first to characterize the rumen methanogen communities in three dairy cattle breeds across a lactation period. ngs produced over  <dig> million sequence reads and demonstrated that diversity was different at  <dig> dim. notably, a core methanogen community persisted and consisted of four species, mbr. smithii, mbr. thaueri, mbr. ruminantium, and mbr. millerae. these methanogens may play a significant role in methanogenesis and in the utilization of substrates from bacterial, protozoal, and fungal fermentation. however future work is required to better delineate these relationships. the sgmt-ro clades did not vary by breed or dim, instead, the sgmt clade was dominant in all three breeds. although our results show that breed does not affect the rumen methanogen taxa per se, more studies are needed to clarify if this finding is consistent in other geographic locations and in dairy cattle consuming varying diets.
