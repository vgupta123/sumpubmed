BACKGROUND
cdk5r <dig>  encodes for p <dig>  a protein required for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , whose activity plays a key role in central nervous system development  <cit> . monomeric cdk <dig> does not show any enzymatic activity, requiring association with its regulatory partners p <dig> or p <dig>  during neuronal migration, p35-activated cdk <dig> phosphorylates nudel, the homologous of an aspergillus nidulans gene involved in nuclear translocation and in cytoskeletal organization of migrating neurons by dynein regulation  <cit> . in mouse, cdk <dig> modulates pak kinases and is implicated in actin reorganization, which may be critical for neuron migration along radial glia  <cit> . in mice lacking cdk <dig> or p <dig>  abnormal formation of cortical layers occurs: a loss of the cdk <dig> pathway appears to affect later migrating neurons as the cortical layers emerge from the cortical plate  <cit> , leading to severe cortical lamination defects, adult mortality and seizures  <cit> . the absence of p <dig> did not produce aberrant phenotype, indicating a predominant role of p <dig> in cdk <dig> activation  <cit> . it is also known that both cdk <dig> and p <dig> concentrate at the leading edges of axonal growth cones and have been shown to regulate neuritis outgrowth in cortical neuron culture  <cit> . the active cdk5/p <dig> complex is involved in further processes required for central nervous system development and function, such as axonal regeneration  <cit> , cellular differentiation, neuronal apoptosis  <cit> , learning and memory processes  <cit> , synaptic transmission  <cit>  and membrane trafficking during the outgrowth of neuronal processes  <cit> . hyperactivity of cdk <dig> mediated by p <dig>  a proteolytic fragment of p <dig>  has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as alzheimer's disease  <cit> , parkinson's disease  <cit>  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> . in fact, phosphorylated neurofilaments and their associated kinases, most of which are represented by cdk <dig>  were found in protein aggregates typical of neurodegenerative diseases. findings on cdk5r <dig> deletion in patients with nf <dig> microdeletion syndrome showing mental retardation  <cit>  and the recently reported cdk5r <dig> mutations in non-syndromic mental retardation patients  <cit> , pinpoint the gene as a candidate for mental retardation susceptibility in nf <dig> microdeletion syndrome and in a subgroup of non-syndromic mental retarded patients.

more recently the cdk5/p <dig> complex has also been reported to regulate several activities such as exocytosis, gene transcription, tissue regeneration, senescence, apoptosis and hormone regulation also in extra-neuronal cells  <cit> .

given the key role of cdk5r <dig> in the development, differentiation and physiology of brain and its involvement in extra-neuronal cell activities, it is conceivable that accurate spatio-temporal regulation of its expression is needed. cdk5r <dig> is characterized by an extended 3'-utr , which accounts for about 75% of the whole transcript and is among the 5% longest annotated 3'-utrs  <cit> . we recently reported the presence of known regulatory elements in cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr such as a potential gy-box motif  and three putative au-rich elements  at the 3' end of the transcript  <cit> ; gy-box has been validated as microrna target in drosophila  <cit> ; ares have a well known role in post-transcriptional regulation of mrna stability and degradation through the binding of specific factors  <cit> . these features suggest a role for the 3'-utr in the control of cdk5r <dig> expression.

3'-utrs have been shown to play crucial roles in a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms  <cit> , including modulation of mrna stability and degradation  <cit> , translation efficiency  <cit> , transport out of the nucleus and sub-cellular localization of mrna  <cit> . expression of several important nervous system genes, including genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, biosynthetic enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, growth factors and associated proteins, are known to be regulated by functional elements in their 3'-utrs  <cit> . indeed, post-transcriptional regulation exerted by the 3'-utr has been proposed as an effective counterpart to the mechanism of transcription in fine modulation of gene expression, in particular during the development of the central nervous system  <cit> . the importance of 3'-utrs in regulating gene expression is also underlined by the finding that mutations affecting the 3'-utr can lead to serious pathologies  <cit> . the role of the 3'-utr for appropriated gene control has been demonstrated  <cit>  and it is possible that certain disorders of neuronal plasticity and learning are due to perturbations in 3'-utr-mediated functions  <cit> .

thus, regulatory elements within the 3'-utr of cdk5r <dig> are likely to be involved in the tuning of its expression during central nervous system development and neuronal migration, acting on mrna stability, translation efficiency and/or sub-cellular localization. nevertheless, to our knowledge, studies on cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr function have not yet been reported.

in order to explore the role of cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr we have predicted additional regulatory elements and performed functional studies by means of dual luciferase assays and mrna quantification, observing that the 3'-utr decreases the reporter activity in different cell lines and that different regulatory elements are present, some with stabilizing and others with destabilizing function. we have identified regulatory regions showing cell-line specificity, in particular we have identified a region showing a destabilizing effect caused by increased mrna degradation. we have also observed a stabilizing effect of the 3' end region containing a canonical are in two neuroblastoma cell lines and have obtained evidence of binding of the neuronal-specific elav  proteins to cdk5r <dig> mrna.

we report the first evidence on the involvement of cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr in the modulation of gene expression. these findings suggest that cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr may contribute to modulate its expression during central nervous system development and functioning. the impairment of this mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of both neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.

RESULTS
cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr is highly conserved in mammals and contains several putative regulatory elements
we previously predicted a potential gy-box and three putative ares in cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr  <cit> . in order to refine the search for potential class i/ii ares we looked for the auuua pentameric motif in the whole cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr sequence: we found eight pentamers, among which two are isolated and six are flanked at one or both sides by au stretches . none of these putative ares show auuua pentamers arranged in tandem, a feature of class ii ares, which indicates that these motifs might belong to class i. nevertheless, only one of the eight potential ares  corresponds perfectly to the consensus sequence , according to the ared  <dig>  database definition  <cit> , while the other possible ares show at least two mismatches.

furthermore, we assessed the conservation between human, mouse and rat cdk5r <dig> 3'-utrs, which have very similar lengths . the comparison, performed with the mvista tool , indicates that the three sequences show several regions of at least  <dig> bp with more than 70% identity, notably in their proximal and terminal portions, with an overall sequence identity of  <dig> % and of  <dig> % for the human-mouse and the human-rat pair, respectively; the most conserved portion of human cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr is the 3'-end, which has about 95% identity with both its mouse and rat counterpart. based on this analysis, the three most terminal putative ares  are completely conserved, while the other five show one or more mismatches. it is worth noting that, though the zebrafish cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr, assembled by est analysis, shows a high level of divergence with the sequences of mammals, the portion corresponding to the cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr are that matches the ared consensus is nearly completely conserved, with the exception of only one nucleotide . as far as the gy-box element is concerned, there is only one mismatch between human, mouse and rat, while this element seems to be absent in zebrafish .

as functional ares are likely to be exposed in loops accessible to au-rich binding proteins, we predicted the cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr secondary structure by using the sfold rna-folding algorithm  <cit> : this analysis indicated that in the most stable predicted structure only three possible ares are accessible in a single-stranded loop, in particular the are that follows the ared consensus criteria  . in addition, this are is excluded from rna duplexes even in the other predicted secondary structures, which show higher free energies . the secondary structure analysis of the region of cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr surrounding the gy-box motif has previously been described  <cit> .

human cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr decreases reporter gene activity
the effect of the 3'-utr on gene expression was studied with the luciferase reporter assay. a construct was generated carrying the human cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr downstream of the reporter gene .

the construct pgl <dig> p-utr was transiently transfected in neuroblastoma cell lines sk-n-be and sh-sy5y, in human embryonic kidney hek- <dig> cells and breast tumor mcf- <dig> cell lines. luciferase activity was measured  <dig> hours after transfection.

the are region of bcl <dig> gene from nt  <dig> to  <dig>  has been used as a positive control  as it was shown to have a degradation activity on the mrna  <cit> . pgl <dig> p-b-are leads to a decrease in luciferase activity in all four cell lines .

the luciferase activity of construct pgl <dig> p-utr was significantly lower in the four transfected cell lines compared to the insertion-less pgl <dig> p vector  . the amount of reporter rnas in the cell lines transfected with the above luciferase constructs was quantified by realtime rt-pcr in order to identify whether the decrease in luciferase activity was due to lower mrna levels. data were normalized to firefly to control for transfection efficiency and for the housekeeping gene gapdh. the levels of mrna for each sample correlated with the luciferase activity, with the exception of sh-sy5y cells where the transcript level is similar to the insertion-less pgl <dig> p vector .

cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr fragments differently affect reporter gene expression
in order to study whether the destabilizing effect on luciferase activity can be assigned to specific regions, the 3'-utr was divided into six smaller fragments  each containing at least one putative regulatory element according to the in silico prediction described above, and six luciferase reporter constructs were generated .

for each construct we performed a dual luciferase assay as described above. fragmentation of the 3'-utr shows that pgl <dig> p-c <dig>  pgl <dig> p-c <dig> and pgl <dig> p-c <dig> lead to a considerable decrease in luciferase activity in all cell lines  indicating the presence of destabilizing regulatory elements . in particular, pgl <dig> p-c <dig> has the strongest decrease of luciferase activity observed, by more than 80% compared to the control construct. the other fragments decrease luciferase activity with significant difference among cell lines, showing destabilization in all lines with exception of hek- <dig> for pgl <dig> p-c <dig> and sk-n-be and hek- <dig> for pgl <dig> p-c <dig>  pgl <dig> p-c <dig> decreases luciferase activity only in hek- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells  and was not effective in neuroblastoma derived lines.

the quantitation of the above luciferase constructs mrnas in sk-n-be, sh-sy5y, hek- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cell lines by realtime rt-pcr correlated in most cases with the luciferase activity. exceptions were the constructs pgl <dig> p-c <dig> in sh-sy5y, pgl <dig> p-c <dig> in sk-n-be and sh-sy5y and pgl <dig> p-c <dig> in mcf- <dig> in which the reduction of mrna levels was not so marked as the correspondent luciferase activity . these data were normalized as previously described.

c <dig> fragment increases the rate of degradation of the reporter mrna in an are independent way
as the pgl <dig> p-c <dig> construct led to the strongest reduction of luciferase activity and mrna level  we performed a degradation assay in order to determine whether accelerated mrna decay can contribute to the observed reduction in luciferase activity and mrna in sk-n-be cells.

we performed a real-time quantitative rt-pcr to compare mrna levels between the pgl <dig> p-c <dig> and pgl <dig> p in sk-n-be cells at various times after the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor drb, which was initially added  <dig> hours following transfection. these data were normalized on transfection efficiency by using firefly mrna levels and gapdh expression as housekeeping gene. with respect to mrna decay, the calculated half-life of the pgl <dig> p-c <dig> construct was  <dig>  h, significantly lower compared to the insertion-less construct pgl <dig> p- being >  <dig> h . these findings suggest that an accelerated degradation of mrna has contributed to the observed reduction in reporter gene expression and mrna associated with the c <dig> fragment.

in order to restrict the region causing the accelerate degradation of c <dig> fragment and to determine the role of the potential nt 992– <dig> are motif, we divided the c <dig> fragment, according to the presence of conserved stretches, into  <dig> sub-fragments named c <dig>  , c <dig>   and c <dig>    the latter containing the nt 992– <dig> are. this fragments were cloned in the above described reporter vector.

for each construct we performed a dual luciferase assay and the quantization of the luciferase constructs mrnas as described above. fragmentation of c <dig> shows that only pgl <dig> p-c <dig>  leads to a considerable decrease in luciferase activity and mrna level in all cell lines  indicating the presence of unknown regulatory element/s with a destabilizing effect . it is worth to be noted that the c <dig>  construct, containing the putative are, does not reduce both luciferase and mrna levels.

class i are  has a stabilizing effect in neuroblastoma cells while gy-box element does not affect reporter gene expression
we focused on the only canonical are , localized in the c <dig> fragment, which has the consensus sequence for a class i are, and on the gy-box element, localized in the c <dig> fragment.

to verify the actual function of the putative class i are, the region from nt  <dig> to  <dig>  encompassing the are element, was deleted from c <dig> fragment . as shown in fig. 5b, pgl <dig> p-c6del luciferase activity is lower in comparison with that of the insertion-less plasmid  in all four cell lines. it is worth noting that in sk-n-be and sh-sy5y lines, the mrna level of the pgl <dig> p-c6del construct decreases in sharp contrast with the non-deleted construct  indicating that the class i are might act as a stabilizing element in these cell lines .

regarding the gy-box, the sequence gtcttcc  was deleted from the c <dig> fragment. normalized luciferase activity was not affected by the constructs with deleted gy-box in comparison with the corresponding non deleted construct in all the tested cell lines , indicating the inactivity of this element in the cell lines used.

cdk5r <dig> mrna is a target of nelav rna-binding proteins
since cdk5r <dig> 3'utr contains several putative are sequences and the are-containing c <dig> fragment seems to confer mrna stability specifically in the neuronal sk-n-be and sh-sy5y cell lines, we investigated whether neuronal rna-binding proteins  are involved in the post-transcriptional control of cdk5r <dig> mrna. among the are-binding proteins the elav family is of interest since three members  out of four are selectively expressed in neurons and display a stabilizing effect on target mrnas. we tested the binding of the nelav rbps to the cdk5r <dig> transcript by immunoprecipitating endogenous mrna-protein  complexes from sh-sy5y cells with the pan-neuronal elav antibody. the presence of cdk5r <dig> transcript together with gap <dig>  which is a well-known target of nelav proteins, was detected by rt-pcr amplification of co-precipitated mrnas . we also used the irrelevant igg antibody as a negative control in the assay to confirm that the cdk5r <dig> mrna was selectively isolated only from nelav-immunoprecipitated mrnp complexes.

in order to map the binding of nelav proteins along the cdk5r <dig> transcript, we dissected the 3'utr into four sub-regions corresponding to the are containing fragments c <dig>  c <dig>  c4- <dig> and c <dig>  and used them in in vitro uv cross-linking experiments. the radio-labelled c <dig>  c <dig>  c4- <dig> and c <dig> riboprobes were incubated in the presence of brain protein lysates and, after uv irradiation, the formed mrnp complexes were immunoprecipitated by the nelav antibody and resolved on sds-page. we observed that nelav rbps recognized and bound c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> sub-regions, while the c4- <dig> fragment did not form mrnp complexes with nelav proteins .

discussion
cdk5r <dig> is known to be a key regulator of central nervous system development and functioning  <cit>  and it has recently been shown to have several extra-neuronal roles  <cit> . cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr is longer than the eukaryotic 3'-utr average  <cit> , belonging to the 5% longest annotated 3'utrs  <cit>  and was recently reported to contain potential post-transcriptional regulatory elements  <cit> , suggesting that it may be important for the control of cdk5r <dig> gene expression. the particular features of cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr and the lack of functional data prompted us to study its role in the control of gene expression by means of bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase and realtime pcr assays of chimeric constructs.

we have shown that the cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr can down-regulate luciferase expression and we assessed the presence of different sub-regions that can independently affect transcript stability and, in a few cases, translational efficiency in different cell lines.

the high degree of conservation showed by cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr is strongly indicative of a functional role of this region and suggests the presence of different post-transcriptional regulatory elements  <cit> . in particular several ares were predicted, a feature typical of mrnas with high turnover rate  <cit> , among which the nt 2659– <dig> are shows complete identity to the are consensus sequence, according to the ared  <dig>  definition. together with the high phylogenetic conservation in mammals and zebrafish and with the predicted accessibility to the binding of trans-acting factors, the functionality of this element can be hypothesized. it is worth noting that functional ares are present in the 3'-utr of many cyclin mrnas  <cit> , raising the hypothesis that are-mediated post-transcriptional regulation may be a common mechanism for the control of expression in this class of genes, to which cdk5r <dig> belongs.

the pgl <dig> p-utr construct shows a decreased luciferase activity in all the cell lines according to mrna level with the exception of sh-sy5y cells, showing an mrna level comparable to that of the control, which could be explained by the action of mechanisms controlling the translation. the overall effect of the large cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr may be the result of a complex regulation mechanism mediated by multiple 3'-utr domains that act independently of each other, as has been already highlighted in bcl <dig>  cox- <dig>  vegf and c-fos mrnas  <cit> . the dissection of 3'-utr into  <dig> fragments, each containing at least one predicted regulatory element, allowed us to investigate the potential role of each region. all the chimeric constructs showed, in most of the studied cell lines, a general decrease of luciferase activity. in most cases these effects are likely to involve transcript stability rather than translational repression mechanisms, since reduced reporter activity levels corresponded, as determined by realtime rt-pcr experiments, to diminished mrna levels. in some instances the reduction of luciferase activity may be the result of mechanisms affecting both mrna stability and translational efficiency. this effect is particularly evident for c <dig> and 3'-utr constructs in sh-sy5y cell line, suggesting that some elements influencing the behavior of the entire cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr may be found in the c <dig> region .

the strong reduction of luciferase activity and rna induced by c <dig> fragment in all the transfected cell lines suggests the presence of one or more regulatory elements with a potent destabilizing function supported by the degradation assay results. we found that the c <dig>  fragment, containing the only known putative element , is not responsible for the low expression of the c <dig> fragment and thus this are, which is not conserved in rodents, is unlikely to be a destabilizing element. on the other hand, the decreased expression of pgl <dig> p-c <dig>  construct, in which none putative regulatory elements are predicted, prompts us to hypothesize the presence of novel regulatory elements in the c <dig>  fragment. further studies will be necessary to identify the post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to mrna degradation of the above construct.

the non-destabilizing effect detected in hek- <dig> cells for the c <dig> fragment and in sk-n-be and sh-sy5y for c <dig> allows us to hypothesize that these regions are bound by cell-line specific stabilizing factors. the deletion in the c <dig> fragment of the canonical nt 2659– <dig> are reduced mrna levels in all the analyzed cell lines, including sk-n-be and sh-sy5y. this finding strongly suggests a stabilizing role of the canonical element in neuroblastoma-derived cells through the binding of neuronal-specific stabilizing factors expressed in sk-n-be and sh-sy5y cells . the prediction that this are is within a single-stranded loop further supports this hypothesis. several are binding proteins are known, some of which promote the stabilization of their target mrnas, including cyclin mrnas  <cit> . among these proteins, the neuronal specific nelav rbps, hub, huc and hud, play a key role in the induction of neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and have a stabilizing effect on several transcripts containing ares in their 3'-utr  <cit> . the expression of hub and hud has been demonstrated in several neuroblastoma cell lines  <cit> .

our immunoprecipitation assays show that the neuronal-specific nelav rbps bind to cdk5r <dig> transcript in sh-sy5y cells. the uv cross-linking experiments allowed us to observe that c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> sub-regions show affinity for nelav proteins in vitro while, although c4- <dig> contains putative ares, it does not bind to nelav rbps. the luciferase activity together with the realtime pcr results in comparison to uv cross-linking data, suggest that the binding shown by c <dig> and c <dig> regions for nelav may be not so effective in vivo as in the case of c <dig> region. this finding might be explained by possible interactions of these regions with further regulatory destabilizing factors or to possible formation of unfavourable secondary mrna structures. according to the rna-operon model, trans-acting factors regulate mrnas within a coordinated pathway of rna processing, providing cells of a fast and dynamic tool to respond to environmental cues  <cit> .

our results on interaction of the nelav factors with cdk5r <dig> messenger in a neuronal cell line support the hypothesis of a neuron-specific post-transcriptional regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression. this mechanism may be activated during central nervous system development to rapidly increase dosage of a protein such as p <dig>  characterized by a rapid turnover through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> .

the generation of a construct with the canonical gy-box motif deleted revealed the inactivity of this element in all the cell lines used for the transfection experiments. these data indicate that this motif does not seem to be involved in the regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression.

our findings have shown the presence of several regulatory elements in cdk5r <dig> 3'-utr, and for a few of them we assessed a destabilizing or stabilizing function. the 3'-utr seems to contain some regulatory elements implicated in rapid mrna turnover which, as a consequence, maintain the steady-state transcript at low levels, and others which have a cell-specific stabilizing effect on the transcript that may contribute to rapidly increase the expression of cdk5r <dig> during specific biological processes. thus the 3'-utr may exert a key role in fine tuning of cdk5r <dig> expression that in turn might be crucial during the complex processes underlying correct central nervous system development and neuronal survival in which cdk5r <dig> is involved  <cit> . the active cdk5-p <dig> complex is strongly involved in neurofilament phosphorylation and its aberrant hyperactivity has been shown to be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . it has recently been demonstrated in mouse that p <dig> protein level is a rate-limiting factor for the up-regulation of cdk <dig> activity  <cit> . thus an up-regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression in neurons may have pathological implications causing neurodegenerative diseases. on the other hand, the absence of p <dig> leads to abnormalities in the laminar structure of cerebral cortex, affecting actin-cyotskeletal dynamics and microtubule regulation  <cit> , and severe mental retardation was shown by patients with nf <dig> microdeletion syndrome with the lack of one copy of cdk5r <dig>  <cit> . according to our results we hypothize that an up- or down-regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression, caused by defective post-transcriptional mechanisms, may have pathogenetic implications in neurodegenerative disorders or cognitive impairment-based diseases, respectively.

despite the fact that p <dig> activity has primarily been associated with central nervous system, several extra-neuronal roles of p <dig> have recently been shown, causing direct or indirect effects on the organization of cytoskeletal structures  <cit> . the cdk5r <dig> expression is likely to be finely controlled also in non-neuronal tissues. our findings on non-neuronal cell lines suggest that the 3'-utr might be involved in the post-transcriptional control of cdk5r <dig> expression in different tissues and that an alteration of this mechanism may cause cellular dysfunction and disease. the large 3'-utr of cdk5r <dig> is expected to contain further regulatory elements, creating the possibility of complex gene expression modulation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study evidences for the first time the involvement of 3'-utr in the modulation of cdk5r <dig> expression by the presence of both destabilizing and stabilizing cis-regulatory elements in 3'-utr, also supporting the hypothesis that cdk5r <dig> gene expression is controlled in neurons by nelav-mediated mechanisms, with potential implications in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.

additional studies are necessary to validate the biological function of the predicted regulatory elements and to identify novel cis-acting regulatory motifs such as microrna target sites, in order to evince the role of 3'-utr in the regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression. this search may eventually clarify the molecular basis of some neurological diseases and in perspective the validated regulatory elements may represent new pharmacological targets for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
