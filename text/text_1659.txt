BACKGROUND
lymphomas are the 6th leading cause of cancer mortality in the usa especially in patients younger than 40 years
 <cit> . more than 11% of human lymphomas overexpress the cd <dig> antigen —this includes all hodgkin’s lymphomas  and some non-hodgkin’s lymphomas ; e.g. anaplastic large cell lymphoma , primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma , adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma , peripheral t-cell lymphoma , natural killer /t-cell lymphoma, nasal and enteropathy type t cell lymphoma
 <cit> . natural “spontaneous” animal models that mimic the human lymphoma microenvironment, and have a functional immune system, are invaluable tools to understand lymphoma development
 <cit> . marek’s disease —a cd4+ t cell lymphoma of chickens caused by the gallid herpesvirus type  <dig> —is a unique natural animal model for herpesvirus induced lymphomagenesis in general and cd30hi lymphomas specifically
 <cit> .

cd <dig> overexpression is an evolutionarily conserved process in neoplastic transformation in human and chicken lymphomas of different etiologies
 <cit> . like human cd30hi lymphomas, md lymphomas are a heterogeneous mix of a minority of neoplastically transformed lymphocytes , surrounded by majority of non-transformed  lymphocytes
 <cit> . physiologically, cd <dig> signaling modulates cell survival and death; however, in cd30hi lymphoma cells, it preferentially promotes cell survival
 <cit> . cd <dig> overexpression  induces a t helper  <dig>  or regulatory t cell -like cytokine microenvironment, which is antagonistic to cell mediated immunity, immune evasive
 <cit> , and promotes lymphomagenesis
 <cit> .

cd <dig> signaling activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa b , which regulates genes associated with cell survival, proliferation, programmed cell death , stress and immunity
 <cit> . constitutive nf-κb activation, due to cd <dig> overexpression and ligand dependent/independent signaling, results in neoplastic transformation in human cd30hi lymphomas
 <cit> . the human oncogenic viruses epstein-barr virus  and kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  both subvert nf-κb activation via the cd <dig> signaling pathway when transforming cells—as mdv does in the chicken
 <cit> . this suggests that the cd <dig> signaling pathway is fundamental, or at least highly beneficial to herpesvirus survival
 <cit> .

md transformed lymphocytes have increased mdv oncogene “meq” expression
 <cit> . meq is essential for mdv lymphomagenesis
 <cit>  and a positive correlation exists between meq and cd <dig> expression
 <cit> . also, the chicken cd <dig> promoter has  <dig> known meq binding sites, and meq’s promoter has at least one nf-κb binding site
 <cit> . we hypothesize that a feed-forward loop exists, with meq induced cd <dig> overexpression, constitutive nf-κb activation with resulting increased meq transcription—favoring neoplastic transformation.

here we show, using md lymphocytes isolated directly ex vivo that they are either neoplastically transformed and express high levels of cd <dig>  or are non-transformed and express low levels of cd <dig>  that: 1) neoplastic transformation is a continuum and the cd30lo lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment are pre-neoplastic; 2) as the lymphocytes become more neoplastically transformed they become more immune-evasive; 3) the mdv oncogene meq, has a direct role in this process and 4) nf-κb has a central role in this neoplastic transformation. in vitro, we show that: 1) a feed forward loop exists in which meq activates cd <dig> transcription resulting in cd <dig> protein overexpression, which induces nf-κb activation which activates meq transcription ; 2) meq and nf-κb transcriptional effects on the meq promoter can be additive and that nf-κb isoforms have different effects; 3) meq transcriptionally activates or represses the cd <dig> promoter depending on whether it is derived from a md-susceptible or -resistant genotype; 4) the meq interactome consists of proteins involved in physiological processes central to lymphomagenesis.

RESULTS
because the proteome directly affects phenotype, but the transcriptome merely influences the proteome and thus may only indirectly affect the phenotype
 <cit> , we based our systems biology model of neoplastic-transformation in md on the differences between the transformed cd30hi, and the non-transformed cd30lo md lymphocytes proteomes. we isolated cd30hi and cd30lo lymphocytes directly ex vivo at >99% purity as described
 <cit> . all comparisons and differential expressions are expressed as cd30hi relative to cd30lo lymphocytes . of the  <dig>  proteins we identified   <dig>  proteins were significantly increased, and  <dig> proteins had significantly decreased expression in the cd30hi lymphocytes.

functional modeling
to visualize the differences between the cd30hi and cd30lo lymphocytes proteomes  in terms of well-studied cancer pathways, the differential protein expression data  was manually mapped to the cancer specific pathway “pathways in cancer” from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes 
 <cit>  . this specific kegg pathway is a map of several different interacting signaling pathways and so provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular signatures of cd30hi and cd30lo lymphocyte proteomes. we further modified the kegg pathway by adding the meq oncoprotein, previously published meq interacting proteins, and our hypothesized meq-cd30-nf-κb feed forward loop. 

a mixed pattern emerged with protein levels increasing, decreasing and not changing. however, in several of the pathways described below, key regulatory proteins were differentially expressed: nf-κb, ikk, vegf, mdm <dig>  cd <dig>  hspa <dig>  myc, jun, tgfβ, and meq were increased; whereas, rb, penk, and brca <dig> were decreased. this indicates that neoplastic transformation is being regulated by these key proteins. the mdv oncoprotein meq interactions, and our hypothesized meq-cd30-nf-κb feed-forward loop, suggest that meq interacts with several key proteins involved in neoplastic transformation, immune evasion and cell survival.

ingenuity pathway analysis -based functional grouping of the significantly expressed pathways  confirmed our previous findings
 <cit>  that pcd was perturbed and integrin signaling was increased in cd30hi cells. ipa analysis also indicated that pcd signaling, molecular mechanisms of cancer, nf-κb activation by viruses, p <dig> signaling, pparα/rxrα activation, pten signaling, brca <dig> in dna damage, vegf signaling, wnt/β-catenin signaling, lymphotoxin β receptor signaling , tgf-β signaling  and nitric oxide signaling  were activated in both cd30hi and cd30lo cells. the physiological processes that the pathways affect, and the differences between the cell types, suggest that the cd30lo lymphocytes are pre-neoplastic precursors of the cd30hi lymphocytes.

to this point our modeling was on a global scale. using the same data , we next tested eight specific functional hypotheses  pertaining to essential steps of neoplastic transformation in the transition of cd30lo to cd30hi lymphocytes:

a) growth signals are perturbed: growth factors control cell division and their deregulation contributes to neoplasia. igf <dig> increases cell cycle and prevents pcd
 <cit>  and it is transactivated by gh <dig> . growth hormone gh <dig>  which interacts with mdv’s sorf <dig> protein, is a suggested md resistance gene
 <cit> ; however, both gh <dig> and sorf <dig> protein expression were the same in the cd30lo and in cd30hi cells. our results suggest that the growth factor effects on md resistance identified previously , may either occur at an earlier stage of md, or are unrelated to lymphomagenesis. growth factor receptors activate pathways for growth, proliferation, differentiation, survival, migration, angiogenesis and metabolism and, in contrast to the growth factors, the growth factor receptor proteins hgfr  and pdgfr were increased. hgfr, which binds fas and inhibits pcd, is also over-expressed in human cd30hi lymphomas
 <cit>  as is pdgfr
 <cit> . pdgfr over-expression can also make cells hyper-responsive to pdgf
 <cit> . cd30hi lymphocytes also had 4-fold more nuclear-located erbb protein and over-expression and nuclear localization of erbb- <dig> and − <dig> are common in tumors
 <cit> .

growth factor receptors activate the mapk, jak-stat, and, through pi3k/akt, the mtor signaling pathways. the mapk pathway activates jun, fos and myc, and the jak-stat pathway activates vegf and both promote proliferation and angiogenesis. in the mapk pathway, hras was decreased and jun and myc were increased. jun mrna was decreased and, as jun transcription is autoregulated by jun protein , and jun heterodimerizes with meq. we suggest that even though total jun protein was increased in cd30hi lymphocytes, it is not available for auto-transactivation, an alternative possibility is that as jun protein is stabilized by post-translational interactions with meq, the jun mrna may not actually reflect the total jun protein levels
 <cit> .

activated pi3k phosphorylates akt, which in turn activates ikka, mtor  and mdm <dig> and inhibits fkhr, casp <dig>  bad, p <dig> and p <dig> genes
 <cit> . ikka, mdm <dig>  casp <dig> increased, though fkhr, p <dig>  p <dig>  mtor  did not. pten inhibits pi3k signaling in the absence of growth factors, and stk <dig>  inhibits mtor activity when atp is low
 <cit> . consequently, cells lacking functional pten or stk <dig> exhibit deregulated, but constitutive, signaling to mtor, resulting in cancer . though pten protein was not differentially expressed, stk <dig> protein  decreased. from an antigrowth signal perspective, rb <dig> sequesters the e2f transcription factors transcriptionally-repressing genes essential for g <dig> to s phase cell cycle progression
 <cit>  and rb <dig> was decreased suggesting increased cell cycle progression in cd30hi lymphocytes supporting our previous work
 <cit> .

b) cell cycle and pcd are dysregulated: cell cycle regulation and pcd are intimately linked. the proto-oncogenic wnt proteins were increased and wnt activation leads to ctnnb protein nuclear translocation. ctnnb also increased and was 80% nuclear. canonically, ctnnb translocation results in tcf-mediated activation of the proto-oncogene myc , anti-pcd protein survivin and the g1/s-specific cyclin-d <dig> 
 <cit> . bcl <dig> blocks apoptosis in many diverse cancers, and in-vitro work using a rodent fibroblast cell line, suggests that mdv meq increases bcl <dig> mrna
 <cit> , and proposed that this is important in md lymphomagenesis. in our work from md lymphocytes in vivo, bcl <dig> protein was unchanged suggesting that any bcl <dig> functional-deregulation may occur prior to the cd30lo to cd30hi transition in the lymphoma environment. hsp <dig> inhibits both the intrinsic and the extrinsic pcd mechanisms and is frequently increased in malignant tumors
 <cit> , meq also co-localizes with hsp <dig> in the nucleus
 <cit>  where hsp <dig> mediates meq’s interaction with tp <dig> and cdk2
 <cit> . in agreement, we found hsp <dig> protein was increased and was 100% nuclear. decreased penk increases anti-pcd-gene transcription
 <cit>  and penk protein was decreased by half, and its nuclear distribution decreased by 70%, suggest decreased pcd possibly mediated by meq .

c) telomeres are dysregulated: shortened telomeres promote pcd and the telomerase complex maintains telomere length in cancer
 <cit> . the telomerase complex has two core components: telomerase rna  and the enzyme tert. cd30hi lymphocytes have 20% more nuclear tert. furthermore, pot <dig>  a protein also required for telomerase maintenance
 <cit> , was also increased in cd30hi cells.

d) angiogenesis is increased: tumor cells can induce neo-angiogenesis or vasculogenesis
 <cit> , and pro-angiogenic vegf was increased and anti-angiogenic mmp <dig> remained unchanged, suggesting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.

e) metastasis is promoted: metastasis a primary cause of cancer mortality and part of md pathogenesis. ezrin  is essential for metastasis
 <cit>  and is consistently increased in metastatic cancers
 <cit> . ezr complexes with nf <dig>  links membrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, and regulates cell survival, adhesion and migration
 <cit> ; it also complexes with cd44
 <cit>  and met
 <cit>  to promote metastasis. ezr, nf <dig>  cd <dig> and met were all increased suggesting that metastasis is more a function of cd30hi, than cd30lo, lymphocytes and this is consistent with human cd30hi lymphomas.

f) immune evasion mechanisms are increased: man1a <dig>  , was increased and this supports our previous contention that as neoplastic transformation proceeds, a t-reg-like phenotype is induced
 <cit> . irg <dig> protein and mrna  were decreased in the cd30hi cells. expression of irg <dig> mrna is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide after bacterial infection of macrophages/monocytes
 <cit> . there is very limited published literature about irg1’s functions in lymphomas, however, recent studies in md literature have suggested that irg <dig> may be associated with apoptosis and is potentially pro-apoptotic
 <cit> . by searching the ebi gene expression atlas  we found that irg <dig> mrna is decreased in some human and mouse lymphoid neoplasia datasets also—as is its regulator leukemia inhibitory factor . we speculate that both lif and irg <dig> are worthy of investigation in future for a role in neoplastic transformation and anti-apoptosis in mdv pathogenesis
 <cit> . the data that we found in the ebi gene expression atlas shows that such a mechanism may exist in human disease also, but this data has not yet been recognized, nor the hypothesis tested, by human medical research.

g) epigenetic regulators are activated: dna methyl transferases , histone acetyltransferase  and histone deacetylases ] are implicated in human and md lymphomas
 <cit>  and hdac- <dig> and − <dig> mrnas, and dnmt3b and hdac <dig> proteins, were increased.

h) mdv proteins other than meq are involved and have altered expression: the mdv dna replication genes thymidine kinase and deoxyuridine triphosphatase  decreased, in agreement with mdv being latent; but, in addition to meq being increased, so were the envelop glycoproteins d, i, k, the major capsid protein and nuclear egress lamina protein – all are structural proteins important for mdv horizontal transmission. this supports our previous work that cd30hi lymphocytes have the highest load in lymphomas
 <cit>  and suggests lateral mdv cell-cell transmission within the lymphoma. we speculate, that mdv, like ebv
 <cit>  has more than one “latency program” and that the immuno-suppressive lymphoma environment “permits” mdv to produce more proteins than it would in other environments. we also suggest, based on our data above, that, as in ebv
 <cit> , epigenetic regulation plays a role in latency programs.

biological processes associated with neoplastic transformation and immune-evasion
at a higher level, the gene ontology  allows explicit modeling not limited by canonical pathways
 <cit> . we compared cd30hi and cd30lo lymphocyte proteomes, using quantitative go biological process  modeling , for the biological processes inherent in neoplasia as described
 <cit> . although both the cd30hi and cd30lo lymphocytes have pro-neoplastic phenotypes  the cd30hi cell proteome is more pro-neoplastic than the cd30lo. 
 <cit> .

next, we compared the cd30hi and cd30lo lymphoma cell immune-phenotypes
 <cit>  . we have identified the md lymphoma microenvironment as predominantly t-reg-like
 <cit>  but did not differentiate which lymphocytes were contributing to the phenotype. here we show that the cd30hi and cd30lo cell proteomes have similar t-reg-like phenotypes and the cd30hi lymphocytes are more th-2-biased, but less th- <dig> and pro-inflammatory-biased, than the cd30lo lymphocytes. this is consistent with a model of increased cd <dig> expression and signaling promoting immune-evasion
 <cit> .

transcriptional regulation
to identify potential direct transcriptional proteome regulation, we used the 44 k agilent chicken microarray
 <cit>  to quantify mrna and micro rna  isolated from the same cd30hi and cd30lo lymphocytes which were used for proteomics and compared transcriptional fold changes with protein fold changes . overall there was poor fold change correlation between mrna and protein for  <dig> host gene products . next, to identify the key regulatory proteins responsible for neoplastic transformation, all the gene products which were differentially expressed in the same direction at both mrna and protein levels were selected for further analysis. there are  <dig> gene products whose mrna and protein fold changes were both significant and directionally consistent with each other  and these have an overall positive correlation . of these, on cross referencing with the published literature, revealed that brca <dig>  cd <dig>  cd40l, cst <dig> and penk are known to be involved in human cd30hi lymphomas
 <cit>  and, except for cd <dig>  all had decreased expression in cd30hi cells. brca <dig> is involved in error-free dna-damage repair and decreased brca <dig> expression results in erroneous joining of dna breaks
 <cit> ; cd <dig> is over-expressed in all human hl and some nhl
 <cit> ; cd40l prevents caspase-dependent and -independent pcd in hl cell lines
 <cit> ; cst <dig> is secreted by neoplastically transformed cells
 <cit> , inhibits neovascularization
 <cit>  and, via its inhibitory effect on cathepsin b and s, inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis
 <cit>  and is a biomarker in humans for nhl relapse
 <cit> . cst3’s mrna and protein decrease in md cd30hi lymphocytes is consistent with human and murine lymphomas
 <cit>  and decreased cst <dig>  enhances angiogenesis, tumor burden, tumor cell proliferation and tumor invasion
 <cit>  and also leads to increased expression of pro-neoplastic growth factor like igf <dig> and fgf <dig> in mice
 <cit> . in cells over-expressing nf-κb, and in coordination with tp <dig>  penk induces pcd
 <cit> , and so its decreased expression favors neoplasia. 

specific go-based bp modeling of these  <dig> concordantly-expressed genes shows that they are involved in bps known to be perturbed in, and central to, neoplastic transformation : 25% are involved in proliferation, 20% in cell cycle and ~ 10% in regulating pcd, cell-cell adhesion , innate and adaptive immunity, oxidative stress, dna damage response and glucose metabolism.

we next ranked the genes based on their mrna: protein expression correlation, and then grouped them into pentiles and compared the distribution of bp by pentile . across the five pentiles gene expression regulation was the most dominant bp; the next two biggest bp groups, consistent across the five pentiles, were proliferation and cell cycle. both proliferation and cell cycle are central to lymphoblastoid cell physiology and neoplastic transformation. the proliferation: cell cycle and proliferation: pcd ratios were both  <dig>  in pentile  <dig>  in contrast the mean ratios for the other four pentiles were  <dig>  . the high correlation between mrna and protein expression, coupled with predominance of genes involved in cell proliferation in pentile  <dig> , suggested that pentile  <dig> genes may be transcriptionally regulated via meq and this would favor neoplastic transformation.

we next identified the numbers of putative canonical mdv meq binding sites  in each of the  <dig> concordantly-expressed genes’ promoters  as described
 <cit> . genes in pentile  <dig>  have more meq binding sites in their promoters than those in the other pentiles, which do not differ from each other . of the five concordant genes previously implicated in lymphomagenesis in other species, brca <dig>  cd <dig>  cd40lg, and penk are in pentile  <dig> with a group mrna:protein expression correlation  of  <dig> , suggesting direct transcriptional regulation by meq. in contrast, cst <dig> is in pentile  <dig> with a large decrease in protein but small decrease in mrna. it is possible that cst <dig> is regulated at the level of mirna; an alternative possibility is that cst <dig> is a secreted protein so a small decrease in mrna could result in a large decrease in cellular protein and, consistent with our observation, most cst <dig> was located in the predominantly soluble differential detergent fraction  <dig>  notably, irg <dig> was in pentile  <dig>  and has the most meq binding sites of all the concordant genes , all of which are mere ii binding sites, suggesting meq induced transcriptional repression, and a central role in md neoplasia. overall, the data suggests that the genes in pentile  <dig> are critical for neoplastic transformation.

mirnas are non-coding post transcriptional repressors potentially important in neoplasia and we identified  <dig> expressed chicken mirnas . of these, nine  are increased, and five  are decreased in cd30hi cells. in mdv infected cefs, gga-mir-29b,- <dig> -133a,-10b,-30d were increased, and gga-mir-let-7a, 7b, 7f and gga-mir-1a, mir-130a were decreased
 <cit> ; of these only gga-mir-10b was increased in our data. this suggests that the in vivo lymphoma environment where mdv is “latent” is functionally quite different from a lytic fibroblast culture. in vitro, gga-mir- <dig> and gga-mir- <dig> inhibit expression of cdk inhibitor protein p27/kip <dig>  but p27/kip <dig> protein was increased in the mdv transformed lymphoblastoid cell line msb-1
 <cit> . in our results gga-mir- <dig> was not differentially expressed and gga-mir-222a was decreased: and this is consistent with our data that p27/kip <dig> protein is not differentially expressed. gga-mir-26a inhibited il- <dig> mrna and was decreased in seven md transformed cell lines
 <cit> , but again in our dataset, neither gga-mir-26a nor il- <dig> were differentially expressed and neither was il- <dig> protein.

we used the mirdb <cit>  to identify novel mirna targets , and we found that the  <dig> different mirnas that increased in cd30hi lymphocytes target several genes associated with neoplastic processes : gga-mir- <dig> targets fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule  <dig>  rab22a  and hdac 9; gga-mir- <dig> targets fas associated factor  <dig>  and gga-mir- <dig> targets ras related viral oncogene homolog  <dig>  except faf <dig>  none of these proteins were identified and so we cannot confirm the upregulated mirna’s potential effects on neoplasia in cd30hi cells. notably however, gga-mir- <dig> which targets ezr mrna , was decreased and ezr  protein increased; i.e. we suggest that one reason for the increase in ezr protein is decreased gga-mir- <dig> translation-inhibition.

cd30hi lymphocytes have increased levels of activated nf-κb
constitutive nf-κb activation is a proposed mechanism by which overexpressed cd <dig> induces neoplastic transformation in human hl and nhl and in md
 <cit> . our global proteomics modeling data , ingenuity pathway analysis, and mrna-protein correlation data  further suggested a direct role of meq and nf-κb in md transformation. cd <dig> activates nf-κb via both canonical and non-canonical pathways and both ligand-dependently and -independently
 <cit> . in the canonical pathway, iκb inhibitors, iκbα, iκbβ, and iκbϵ  are phosphorylated by iκb kinases  and ubiquitinated by ubiquitin ligase . proteasomal degradation of iκb inhibitory proteins releases nf-κb dimers, which translocate to the nucleus and transactivate target genes
 <cit> . in the non-canonical pathway, p <dig>  acts as iκb inhibitory molecule and an ikkα homodimer acts as the main activator: ikkα phosphorylates p <dig>  resulting in proteasomal degradation of inhibitory c-terminal domain , which generates the p <dig> subunit  and dimerizes with rela or relb to form functional nf-κb dimers
 <cit> .

we found that nf-κb p <dig> , p <dig>  and relb and ikkα proteins all increased in cd30hi lymphocytes  and most p <dig> and all p <dig> protein  were nuclear . nf-κb signaling is controlled by negative feedback via iκbα and a20/tnip <dig>  transcriptional induction
 <cit>  and we found tnfaip <dig> mrna and protein unchanged but iκbα mrna decreased, suggesting that this negative feedback mechanism is suppressed. the tnfaip <dig> and iκbα promoters have  <dig>  and  <dig>  predicted meq-binding sites, respectively, which suggest that mdv has evolved to maintain nf-κb activation. not only do cd30hi lymphocytes have more of all nf-κb isoforms but more are nuclear , again suggesting nf-κb activation. furthermore in cd30hi lymphocytes, most ikkα is phosphorylated at the canonical residues that regulate proteasome-mediated degradation
 <cit>  and destabilization
 <cit> , whereas the opposite occurred for ikkα in cd30lo lymphocytes . 

nf-κb transactivates meq transcription in vitro
because we proposed a feed-forward loop model of increasing meq and cd <dig> expression
 <cit>  and our global analysis suggests that nf-κb is central in md lymphomagenesis, we tested nf-κb isoforms’ transactivation potential on the meq promoter using in vitro transcription reporter assays . we cloned genes rela , nfkb <dig>  and nfkb <dig>  and meq  into expression plasmids. soge cells
 <cit>  were transfected with the reporter plasmid alone or in combination with plasmids expressing different nf-κb isoforms and/or meq, and transcription was quantified by qpcr. the three nf-κb isoforms differentially transactivated the meq promoter : p <dig> was less than p <dig> and rela  alone, which produced similar transcription and were less than p <dig> and rela  together . meq alone transactivated the meq promoter to similar levels as the positive control cytomegalovirus promoter and, when used together with different nf-κb isoforms, except in the p50-p <dig> dimer, it further increased transcription. this finding suggests that neoplastic transformation in md depends fundamentally on cd <dig> signaling, and may explain why md neoplastically-transformed cell survival  critically depends on the lymphoma environment
 <cit> , as well as why mdv co-opted the cd <dig> signaling pathway. 

meq-dependent differential cd <dig> promoter transcription
it would be reasonable that differences in the cd <dig> promoter could confer differences in meq-induced activation or repression of the cd <dig> gene and is of interest to us because of chicken genotype differences to md lymphomagenesis after mdv infection. to measure meq-induced cd <dig> transcription on different cd <dig> promoters, we first cloned and sequenced cd <dig> promoters  from two md-resistant  and four md-susceptible  genotypes of chickens and sequenced these. an unrooted phylogenetic tree  of these sequences matched the chicken line breeding history
 <cit> . lines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are part of  <dig> lines developed to study the genetics of avian neoplasia
 <cit> . line  <dig> and  <dig> share common ancestors and this is emulated in their phylogenetic closeness in our data. line  <dig> is also genetically related to lines  <dig> and  <dig> and some line  <dig> birds were isolated and interbred to produce the 15i sublines. further sublines  were produced by further inbreeding. notably, line  <dig> was accidentally crossed with 15i <dig> <cit> , and we independently identified this event in our phylogenetic tree, which places line  <dig> closer to line 15i <dig> than line  <dig>  lines n and p are non-inbred lines developed independently to study mhc class i-based resistance and susceptibility to md
 <cit> .

after cloning into an expression plasmid, each cd <dig> promoter was used in in vitro transcription assays using a meq-expressing plasmid. meq altered transcription from all cd <dig> promoters’ alleles  — increasing expression in md-susceptible lines  <dig>   <dig> and p, but decreasing in the mhc md-resistant line n and the very late lymphoma forming
 <cit>  line 15i <dig>  md resistant line  <dig> had a small increase in transcription. the trend is that cd <dig> promoter transcription is associated with md lymphoma resistance and susceptibility and that meq has host genotype-dependent transcriptional-activation or repression from the cd <dig> promoter. however, although there are  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  between the lines’ promoter sequences , none occur in the predicted canonical meq binding sites
 <cit>  and sequences other than these previously-described meq binding sites must be functional. we identified one snp at position 1754 bp in 15i <dig> and 1755 bp in line n 5’ of the atg as a candidate; transcription factor binding prediction
 <cit>  identifies the corresponding region in all lines as an ap- <dig> binding site and we suggest that this snp could be responsible for differential function.

meq interacts directly with proteins central to lymphomagenesis
meq’s functions are modulated by its interacting partners. here we wanted to identify which proteins were involved with meq in the context of dna binding and so we used chromatin immunoprecipitaion  using anti-meq antibodies , followed by 2d lc-msms. we used msb- <dig> mdcc cells as a model for tumor cells. we identified  <dig> proteins . we used these  <dig> proteins and included previously identified interacting proteins , to produce theoretical meq interactome model. from these, and using binding proteins from literature, we produced a meq interactome model . using go bp annotations for all the proteins that we modeled in the network, we next generated a go bp-based functional interaction network . this model suggests how meq could interact with proteins associated with bps critical to tumor formation such as cell growth, development, apoptosis, stress, immunity, transcription, cell adhesion, energy metabolism, protein metabolism and transport.

discussion
evidence supporting a direct mechanistic connection between inflammation and cancer has been mounting over the last decade
 <cit> . the very early pre-lymphoma md lesion microenvironments are highly inflammatory
 <cit> . nf-κb is one of the central inflammatory mediators that is often, and diversely, associated with neoplastic transformation
 <cit>  and is a key component of the transformation pathways employed by some herpesviruses. the kshv latency-associated proteins vgpcr and vflip, maintain a sustained level of activated nf-κb by interacting with ikk protein complex and micro rna clusters  which inhibit iκbα protein expression, thus inhibiting the lytic cycle, inducing the latency and transformation
 <cit> . in ebv positive hl the transformed cells overexpress cd <dig>  cd <dig>  rank receptors and their cognate ligands are expressed on surrounding stromal cells. ligand and receptor interaction  activates downstream signaling and activation of nf-κb occurs
 <cit> . ebv encoded lmp- <dig> protein mimics the activated cd <dig> receptors and results in spontaneous nf-κb activation
 <cit> . our “omic” and reductionist experiments in this work suggest that mdv has also evolved to directly perturb the nf-κb signaling pathways while in viral latency.

in vitro mdv meq induced cd <dig> expression and persistently activated nf-κb and ex vivo-derived cd30hi lymphocytes have increased and activated nf-κb protein. not only does meq enhance its own transcription  but it also augments nf-κb transcription. we also suggest that iκbα-mediated negative feedback, which controls nf-κb activation, is hypoactive in cd30hi cells. this is consistent with evidence that proinflammatory cytokines induce nf-κb inducing kinase , which preferentially phosphorylates ikkα over ikkβ to activate nf-κb
 <cit>  and, while recent evidence suggests that ikkβ is primarily activated in response to pro inflammatory cytokines and microbial products, ikkα regulates the alternative pathway of nf-κb activation in lymphoid malignancies
 <cit> . ikkα is also preferentially activated by the members of tnf receptor family
 <cit> . inducing persistent nf-κb signaling through specific oncoproteins has been demonstrated for human oncogenic viruses, including ebv, human t cell leukemia virus type  <dig>  and kshv
 <cit> . notably, ebv lmp- <dig> effects nf-κb activation through the nf-κb essential modifier protein which, with ikkα and ikkβ protein, comprises the iκb kinase  complex
 <cit>  and we speculate that mdv  has evolved to similarly target the ikk complex.

regardless, our data supports our hypothesized model that meq initiates a self-reinforcing cd <dig> signaling cycle resulting in constitutive and aberrant nf-κb activation and subsequent neoplastic transformation. herpesviruses co-evolve with their hosts and and the last common ancestor between ebv and mdv was at least ~300 m years ago; mdv, ebv and kshv have separately evolved in different target cells the same fundamental result by targeting the nf-κb pathway. furthermore both mdv meq and ebv lmp-1
 <cit>  are expressed as proteins during viral latency and their hosts mount specific  cytotoxic t cell responses against them
 <cit> . this large evolutionary distance, combined with the risk incurred by inducing an immune response, suggests that perturbing nf-κb confers a strong evolutionary advantage and is further evidence consistent with nf-κb essentiality to neoplasia in general.

meq is essential for md lymphomagenesis
 <cit>  and promotes neoplastic transformation, anchorage-independent growth, cell-cycle progression, and anti-apoptotic activity
 <cit> . our in vitro experiments support meq’s previously demonstrated transcriptional regulation of cd30
 <cit> , and, also show that the transcriptional profile generally follows genetic resistance and susceptibility to md. a similar phenomenon has been observed in the cd <dig> over-expressing human cutaneous lymphoproliferative disease lymphomatoid papulosis
 <cit> : allelic differences in the cd <dig> transcription are due to polymorphisms in the human cd <dig> microsatellite repressor element  and are associated with disease progression to lymphoma
 <cit> .

non-transformed cells are common in lymphomas of all species, and often they form the majority cells in lymphomas. our work suggests that many of these non-transformed cells are likely not immune responding cells in md
 <cit> , but are pre-neoplastic and actively transforming. regardless, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is critical in lymphomagenesis
 <cit> . in ebv-positive hl, the lymphoma microenvironment is t-reg cell rich and the transformed cells secrete immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines like il <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and cxcl <dig>  these cytokines and chemokines , attract non-transformed cells
 <cit>  to the site of lymphomagenesis. similarly, in md, a recent study has shown interactions between vil- <dig>  and peripheral cd <dig> + cd25+ t cells 
 <cit> , and suggested that vil- <dig> may enhance the recruitment of t-reg cells to the mdv lymphoma microenvironment, which would further induce immunosuppression and enhance lymphomagenesis, supporting our previous observations
 <cit> . here, we have expanded on our previous work
 <cit>  and show that both components of lymphoma microenvironment, the cd30hi and cd30lo cells have an overall t-reg-like phenotype and suggest that cd30lo lymphocytes are direct antecedents of cd30hi lymphocytes.

overall, and in the context of understanding mechanistic details of cd30hi lymphomagenesis, our results provide direct ex vivo-derived support in a natural animal model for the in vitro results in other species, which propose that ligand-independent and -dependent cd <dig> signaling-induced constitutive activation of nf-κb is a mechanism of neoplastic transformation in hodgkin’s disease antigen over-expressing lymphomas
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we identify the neoplastic and non-neoplastic component of lymphoma microenvironment using transcriptomics and proteomics followed by systems biology modeling to generates specific hypotheses and then tests these using reductionist methods. this work provides evidence that md neoplastic transformation is a continuum and the cd30lo lymphoma cells are in various stages of neoplastic transformation towards cd30hi phenotype. we hypothesized that mdv uses its meq oncogene to activate cd <dig> transcription to achieve constituent nf-κb signaling resulting in cellular instability and a neoplastic phenotype. our results show that meq, cd <dig> and nf-κb proteins are overexpressed in cd30hi cells and that the majority of nf-κb is intranuclear suggesting an activated state. using transcription reporter assays, we further show that nf-κb isoforms differentially activate meq transcription, and meq and nf-κb isoforms have additive effects. we also show that meq transcriptionally activates or represses the cd <dig> promoter depending upon the host genotype from which the promoter is derived. using chip and mass spectrometry we propose a new meq interactome composed of proteins which are involved in various biological processes inherent in neoplasia. overall, this study provides crucial insights into various molecular mechanisms of neoplastic transformation active within a heterogeneous lymphoma microenvironment in a natural animal model with functional immune system.
