BACKGROUND
cowpea  is grown extensively as a food and fodder crop in west africa, lower elevation areas of eastern and southern africa, north-eastern brazil, parts of the middle east, india, and the south-eastern and south-western regions of north america  <cit> . in west africa cowpea is mainly cultivated as a rainfed crop from april to november depending on the location. cowpea  has a genome size of ~ <dig> mbp  <cit> .

root-knot nematodes  are sedentary endoparasites with a wide host range and one of the world's most damaging crop pests  <cit> . rkn feeding in plant roots leads to development of specialized feeding structures in the vascular parenchyma called "giant cells". the infective stage of this nematode is the second stage-juvenile . j <dig> penetrate the roots and go through three successive molts to become adult females. some economically important rkn species, including m. incognita, reproduce by obligate mitotic parthenogenesis, while many other rkn species reproduce sexually  <cit> .

in cowpea rkn is an important pest worldwide and host plant resistance has been a preferred strategy along with cultural practices to control the nematode population in infested cowpea fields  <cit> . the rk locus in cowpea has been used extensively to breed root-knot nematode resistant varieties in the usa and other countries. this locus was first designated as rk by fery and dukes  <cit>  and it confers resistance to many populations of m. incognita, m. arenaria, m. hapla and m. javanica.

the rk-mediated resistance in cowpea has been characterized histologically by das et al.  <cit> . an important finding from that study was that the resistance response was much delayed during the incompatible interaction and there was an absence of typical hypersensitive reaction  mediated cell death in the resistant roots upon nematode infection. this is in contrast to several other plant-rkn systems studied so far which do have a typical hr. for example, mi- <dig> mediated resistance in tomato triggers a rapid hr as early as  <dig> hours post-infection  <cit> , and both me3-mediated resistance in pepper  <cit>  and incompatible interactions in soybean  <cit>  show strong early hr.

whole genome microarrays provide a means to scan for genes involved in particular biological processes on a global scale. unfortunately cowpea does not yet have a commercially available microarray platform. it was shown previously that the commercially available soybean genechip from affymetrix can be used effectively in cowpea to identify single feature polymorphisms   <cit> . in that study, cowpea rna was used as a surrogate for dna to identify sfps, which established the utility of the soybean genome array as a satisfactory platform for use in examining cowpea transcripts. in the current study the same soybean platform was used to study the global resistant and susceptible cowpea responses to nematode infection of roots.

there have been several microarray studies of the nematode infection process in plants in last few years. the rkn-plant compatible interactions have been studied using microarrays by several groups in arabidopsis  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . global gene expression levels also have been studied during the infection process of another important plant parasitic nematode, soybean cyst nematode   <cit> . however, few studies have examined incompatible plant-nematode interactions in resistant plants  <cit> .

in this study the transcriptome profile of both incompatible and compatible cowpea-rkn interactions for two time points was investigated using the affymetrix soybean genechip. this is the first study of this kind in the cowpea-rkn interaction. it provides a broad insight into the rk-mediated resistance in cowpea and creates an excellent dataset of potential candidate genes involved in both nematode resistance and parasitism, which can be tested further for their role in this biological process using functional genomics approaches.

RESULTS
heterologous microarray platform
in order to elucidate the plant response to root-knot nematodes, infected resistant cb <dig>  was compared with non-infected cb <dig>  and infected susceptible null-rk  was compared with non-infected null-rk. two time points were chosen for this analysis i.e.,  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. nine dpi was selected as a critical time point because sequentially assayed histological sections during  <dig> days of infection revealed that at  <dig> dpi the first subtle differences appeared between incompatible and compatible interactions  <cit> . the 3-dpi samples provided a time point prior to visible differences histologically, between incompatible and compatible interactions.

the average number of soybean probe sets which had "present" call in 9-dpi samples was  <dig> , which comprised 28% of the total number of soybean probe sets on the soybean genechip. similarly, the average number of "present" calls in 3-dpi samples was  <dig>  . when soybean rna was used to hybridize the soybean genechip, the "present" call percentage ranged from 70-75%  <cit> . therefore about 40%  of the content of the soybean genechip is informative for cowpea.

data quality
principal component analysis  was done on triplicate data for each treatment at  <dig> dpi in order to visualize the overall genome response to nematode infection in resistant and susceptible cowpea genotypes. pca on conditions  for the 9-dpi sample are shown in fig.  <dig>  pca component  <dig>  and pca component  <dig>  comprised the majority of the described variance . the pca showed a clear separation between the two genotypes when infected with nematodes whereas the two genotypes clustered together when there was no external stimulus . because we used cowpea near-isogenic lines for this analysis, clustering of the non-infected control samples was expected. this confirmed the robustness of the experimental design. the pca plot for 3-dpi samples is presented in additional file  <dig> 

because there were only two biological replicates for the 3-dpi samples, a correlation analysis was performed between the two replicates of each treatment. a representative ma-scatter plot is shown in fig.  <dig>  correlation coefficients between replicates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  at a p value cut-off of  <dig> , showing the robustness of the data .

gene expression in incompatible and compatible interactions in 9-dpi root samples
at  <dig> dpi three different comparisons were made. in the first comparison gene expression in the resistant cb <dig> roots infected with root-knot nematodes  was compared with non-infected cb <dig>  secondly, a comparison in gene expression was made between the infected null-rk  and non-infected null-rk. finally, a comparison of gene expression was made between the infected rk and infected null-rk near-isogenic lines. the final comparison was important because the near-isogenic lines were predicted to show differential gene expression for the genes which are critical for nematode resistance or nematode parasitism.

in the incompatible interaction  <dig>  genes were significantly differentially expressed between the rk-infected and non-infected treatments based on the statistical test . these genes were then passed through a  <dig>  fold-change filter. the geometric mean of the normalized expression intensities of all samples under one condition were used to calculate the fold-change ratios. if the ratio of geometric means of the infected sample and the non-infected control for a probe set was ≥  <dig> , then that particular probe set was categorized as  <dig> -fold or more up-regulated and if the ratio was ≤  <dig>  then the probe set was categorized as down-regulated by  <dig> -fold or more.  <dig> genes showed  <dig> -fold or more up-regulation and  <dig> genes were down-regulated by  <dig> -fold or more in the rk-infected compared with the rk-non-infected treatment . in the compatible interaction  <dig>  genes passed the statistical filter . among these  <dig>  genes  <dig> were  <dig> -fold or more up-regulated and  <dig> genes were  <dig> -fold or more down-regulated in the infected null-rk compared to the non-infected null-rk treatment . in this context it can be noted that in the current study the number of differentially expressed genes is lower than some of the other microarray studies previously published in the field of plant-microbe interactions. one of the reasons may be due to the use of a heterologous genechip. nevertheless, the information generated will be very valuable as this is the first report on the cowpea root-knot nematode interaction. in the final comparison between the two near-isogenic lines infected with rk-avirulent root-knot nematodes,  <dig> genes  passed the statistical filter. among the differentially expressed genes only  <dig> genes were  <dig> -fold or more up-regulated in the infected rk than in the infected null-rk treatment and  <dig> genes were  <dig> -fold or more down-regulated in the infected rk than in the infected null-rk treatment.

selected genes from all three above comparisons are presented in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with their fold-change ratios and medicago truncatula annotations. the genes were selected based on their fold-change level assuming that the genes with highest fold-change ratio will be likely to have a biological role in the plant-nematode interaction. lists of all genes passing the  <dig> -fold filter are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>

a gene ontology based analysis was carried out to categorize the differentially expressed genes into different functional classes. in the incompatible interaction the most abundant functional class observed for the up-regulated probe sets  was genes involved in metabolism , followed by proteins with binding function  and genes involved in cell rescue and defense . in the compatible interaction the most abundant functional classes in up-regulated probe sets  were metabolism , proteins with binding function , and genes involved in protein fate . for down-regulated probe sets the most abundant functional classes in the incompatible interaction  were proteins with binding function , metabolism , and interaction with the environment , whereas in the compatible interaction the most abundant classes  were proteins with binding function , cellular transport , and systemic interaction with the environment . a significant number of probe sets were also categorized under unclassified or unknown proteins in all the above comparisons.

genes differentially expressed between the two infected nils were also functionally classified . in the probe sets up-regulated in infected resistant cb <dig> over infected susceptible null-rk, the most abundant classes were cellular transport , proteins with binding function , and proteins involved in transcription . among the probe sets which were down-regulated in the resistant genotype over the susceptible genotype, the most abundant functional classes were metabolism , proteins with binding function , and systemic interaction with the environment .

gene expression in incompatible and compatible interactions in 3-dpi root samples
similar to the 9-dpi samples, three different comparisons were made for 3-dpi root samples. in the first comparison gene expression in the resistant rk plants  infected with root-knot nematodes was compared with non-infected rk plants. a comparison in gene expression also was made between the infected null-rk  and non-infected null-rk. finally, a comparison of gene expression was made between the infected rk and infected null-rk near-isogenic lines.

in the incompatible interaction  <dig>  genes were significantly differentially expressed based on the statistical test. these genes were then passed through a fold-change filter based on log <dig> ratios.  <dig> genes showed  <dig> -fold or more up-regulation and  <dig> genes were down-regulated by  <dig> -fold or more in the incompatible interaction . in the compatible interaction  <dig> genes passed the statistical filter . among these  <dig> genes  <dig> were  <dig> -fold or more up-regulated and  <dig> genes were  <dig> -fold or more down-regulated in the compatible interaction . in the final comparison between the two near-isogenic lines infected with rk-avirulent root-knot nematodes,  <dig> genes  passed the statistical filter. among the differentially expressed genes only  <dig> genes were  <dig> -fold or more up-regulated in the resistant cb <dig> compared to susceptible null-rk, and  <dig> genes were  <dig> -fold or more down-regulated in the cb <dig> compared to null-rk plants.

selected genes from incompatible and compatible interactions are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, with their fold-change ratios and annotations based on the medicago annotation database. lists of all genes passing the  <dig> -fold filter are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>

comparison of gene expression between 9-dpi and 3-dpi root samples
a comparison of differentially expressed genes was made between the 9-dpi and 3-dpi samples. in the incompatible interaction  <dig> genes  were uniquely expressed at  <dig> dpi and  <dig>  genes were unique for  <dig> dpi.  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at both time points . in the compatible interaction  <dig> genes  were uniquely expressed at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> genes  were unique for  <dig> dpi.  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at both time points .

discussion
recently a number of interspecies comparisons of gene expression have been carried out including human versus monkeys  <cit> , between rodents  <cit> , human versus mouse  <cit> , within xenopus  <cit> , and within drosophila  <cit> . cross-species analysis of gene expression in non-model mammals was reported by nieto-díaz et al.  <cit> . the reproducibility of probe data obtained from hybridizing deer, old-world primates, and human rna samples to the affymetrix human genechip® u <dig> plus  <dig>  was also compared. the studies showed that cross-species hybridization affected neither the distribution of the hybridization reproducibility among different categories nor the reproducibility values of the individual probes. in plants, the use of heterologous platforms for transcriptome profiling also is becoming more popular. recently the affymetrix arabidopsis genechip was used to analyze gene expression during seed germination in brassica  <cit> . the affymetrix tomato genechip was used to survey the early events associated with the potato tuber cold sweetening  <cit> . the usefulness of the soybean genome array to study cowpea was shown when the affymetrix soybean genechip was used successfully to identify and validate single feature polymorphisms in cowpea  <cit> .

several microarray studies have been conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the root-knot nematode infection process. bar-or et al.  <cit>  reported a transcriptome profile of the compatible interaction in susceptible tomato roots infected with root-knot nematodes. jammes et al.  <cit>  and fuller et al.  <cit>  have done similar studies in arabidopsis infected with root-knot nematodes. several genechip microarray studies have also been made recently to investigate the infection process by soybean cyst nematode, heterodera glycines  <cit> .

microarray studies available so far in the area of plant-nematode interactions mostly examined the compatible or susceptible interaction. there is a dearth of information available for the incompatible plant-root-knot nematode interaction. very recently bhattarai et al.  <cit>  reported the expression profile of mi-1-mediated incompatible interaction in tomato roots infected with root-knot nematodes. they reported the gene expression profile for only one time point, as early as  <dig> hours-post inoculation. incompatible interactions have been monitored for soybean cyst nematode by klink et al.  <cit>  for two time points. in our study both compatible and incompatible interactions were studied using the soybean genome array. this is the first insight into the cowpea-root-knot interaction at the transcriptome level. it has already been shown in related work that rk-mediated resistance in cowpea is characterized by a very delayed but strong and effective resistance response  <cit> .

for this study the 9-dpi time point was critical because histologically there are some subtle observable differences between compatible and incompatible interaction at  <dig> dpi. though the nematodes were able to maintain normal giant cells in resistant roots at  <dig> dpi, more vacuolation was evident for the first time in those giant cells when compared to the giant cells in the susceptible roots at the same stage  <cit> . among the highly up-regulated genes in the incompatible interaction at  <dig> dpi was an alcohol dehydrogenase . adh genes are widely known to respond to different biotic stimuli like fungal elicitors  <cit>  and cyst nematodes  <cit> . this response leads to heavy lignification of cell walls and creates a mechanical barrier for the pathogen. in rice the sequence of  <dig> kb surrounding the two adh gene loci adh <dig> and adh <dig> revealed the presence of  <dig> putative genes, several of them being resistance gene analogues  <cit> . also, among highly up-regulated genes there was a serine threonine protein phosphatase which is known to play a role in negative regulation of defense response in arabidopsis  <cit> . also several plant lectins were highly up-regulated in the incompatible interaction at  <dig> dpi. plant lectins are carbohydrate binding proteins which are reported to be toxic to several plant pathogens  <cit> . these findings are consistent with the indications made by das et al.  <cit>  that the vacuoles of giant cells in the resistant genotype might be loaded with certain toxins which leads to developmental and reproductive arrest of the female nematode. among the down-regulated genes in the incompatible interaction was a superoxide dismutase which generates super oxides  <cit> . down-regulation of this gene in the plant prevents reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death which is combined with up-regulation of peroxidases  in both incompatible and compatible interactions. these results are consistent with the absence of hypersensitive response -mediated cell death in the rk-rkn incompatible interaction in cowpea  <cit> . in the incompatible interaction an expansin was highly down-regulated, and expansins are found to be important for maintaining the specialized feeding structures in hosts by plant parasitic nematodes  <cit> . these findings may indicate that though there is a visible effect of resistance at  <dig> dpi as indicated by increased vacuolation, the plant is able to generate some defense response against the nematode feeding but the nematode is able to partially suppress the plant defense at this time and continue feeding and development.

when the response of the two near-isogenic lines infected with nematodes was compared at  <dig> dpi, it was especially noteworthy that a greater number of genes were suppressed in the resistant genotype than were induced or up-regulated compared to the susceptible genotype. this observation is novel because typically in such comparisons more genes are up-regulated than down-regulated in infected resistant plants compared to infected susceptible plants. for example, more genes were induced in the resistant genotype when near-isogenic lines were compared in sugarcane mosaic virus infected maize plants  <cit>  and in wheat plants infected with leaf rust fungus  <cit> . a plausible explanation for this observation in line with the delayed resistance response is that the defense machinery in the resistant cowpea plant is still suppressed to a large extent and as a result the feeding nematodes are able to maintain functional giant cells even at the 9-dpi stage.

at  <dig> dpi in both compatible and incompatible interactions, more genes were down-regulated than up-regulated. jammes et al.  <cit>  also reported that there were a significant number of genes down-regulated during giant cell formation in arabidopsis roots, indicating that these suppressed genes might be important negative regulators of nematode parasitism. though in both incompatible and compatible interactions at  <dig> dpi there are many induced genes involved in basal defense, only a few genes were common in both interactions. this indicates that despite the similar nature of the infection process in both compatible and incompatible interactions, these two responses have their own molecular signature, unlike mi- <dig> mediated resistance to rkn in tomato in which many genes are shared between the incompatible and compatible interactions  <cit> . when expression patterns from both time points were compared we found that there were very few genes which were differentially expressed in both the 3-dpi and 9-dpi samples. the subtle variation in expression of these genes across time points might play a significant role in this biological pathway. for example, an expansin  <dig> family member  was differentially expressed in both 3- and 9-dpi incompatible interactions. at both time points this particular gene was suppressed but the level of suppression was more in the 3-dpi sample when compared to the 9-dpi sample. it is already established that expansin plays a role in feeding site maintenance in both cyst nematode induced syncytia  <cit>  and root-knot nematode induced giant cells  <cit> . several expansins were found to be up-regulated in syncitia developed by sugarbeet cyst nematode heterodera schachtii in arabidopsis  <cit> . these subtle variances in gene expression levels might lead to the manifestation of the defense response, and represent areas warranting further investigation through functional analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion the results of this study have shown that the typical defense response is still partially suppressed at  <dig> dpi in resistant cowpea roots. there is an indication that subtle variation of ros concentration, induction of toxins and other defense related genes play a role in this unique resistance mechanism. it is clear from this study that nematodes are able to keep plant defense responses under considerable control until a high amount of toxins accumulate in the vacuoles which might have resulted from switching on of the plant defense machinery. one of the possible strategies applied by the nematode might be to control the ros scavenging mechanism in the plants to avoid localised cell death. in mi-1-mediated defense response the nematode is unable to regulate the ros scavenging and as a result a rapid hypersensitive reaction is triggered upon nematode infection. further functional analysis of these differentially expressed genes will help us to understand this intriguing plant-nematode interaction in a more precise manner.
