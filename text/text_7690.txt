BACKGROUND
in general, amongst vertebrates, most studies investigating the development of the skull focus on the calvarial bones or jaws. although some studies have described the growth of particular bones in the teleost skull , less research has been conducted on the intramembranous flat bones such as the opercle or circumorbital bones. of these, the growth and development of the opercle has been described by kimmel and colleagues .

recent studies investigating the development of intramembranous bones associated or within the eye have shown that there is a high degree of patterning involved in the development and growth of these elements  <cit> . in chicken, there is a series of neural crest derived, intramembranous bones in the sclera of the eye known as the scleral ossicles; these bones are similar to the circumorbital bones in the teleost skull in that they are also neural crest derived intramembranous bones  <cit> . the development of the scleral ossicles has been shown to be complex involving inductive tissue interactions, spatial and temporal patterning, and the involvement of multiple gene families. the scleral ossicles in chicken develop through an inductive interaction with epithelial derived conjuctival papillae that are found in direct correlation to the number of ossicles  <cit> . interestingly, following ossicle inhibition, a compensatory response is observed such that the adjacent ossicle in the series expands to close the gap in the series  <cit> . whether this is a widespread phenomenon amongst series of intramembranous bones has not been explored, until now.

in teleosts, a series of neural crest derived intramembranous bones known as the circumorbital bones surround the orbit  <cit> . the development of these circumorbital bones has already been shown to be influenced by the development of the eye in at least one teleost, the mexican tetra astyanax mexicanus  <cit> . in this study, following embryonic lens removal, the eye regressed and the resulting adult skeleton was affected such that the supraorbital and suborbital bones of this bone series enlarged into the orbital region. it was hypothesized that the effect was caused by changes in neural crest cell migration and/or mechanical forces due to eye regression  <cit> . this study highlights the interactions between the soft tissues of the eye and the hard tissues surrounding the eye  and demonstrates the existence of developmental plasticity within these bones.

the infraorbital  bones are a component of the circumorbital series and are located around the underside of the orbit. the io bones are named, infraorbital one through five, according to their position in the skull from anterior to posterior  <cit> . the function of the io bones has not yet been directly investigated; however with such a close association to the eye, these bones likely serve a protective or supportive role. the development of the five io bones is complex and these bones mineralize late in the sequence of zebrafish craniofacial ossification  <cit> .

all five io bones consist of a flat bone component as well as a bony canal which houses part of the cranial lateral line. the functional unit of the lateral line system is the neuromast, a mechanosensory receptor organ, similar to that of the stereocilia of the inner ear of humans. at the core of the neuromast are mechanosensory hair cells, which are innervated by sensory neurons  <cit> . the hair cells are surrounded by both support and mantle cells, the latter of which are thought to secrete the cupula that surrounds them   <cit> . two kinds of neuromasts have been described in teleosts  <cit> . presumptive  canal neuromasts are found enclosed within the lateral line canals while superficial  neuromasts are found in the skin  <cit> . it is the primary neuromasts that are present within the io lateral line canals. webb and shirey  <cit>  described four developmental stages of canal neuromast development in the zebrafish head . the lateral line canals generally form between  <dig>  mm sl  and adulthood   <cit> .figure  <dig>

since skeletogenesis involves induction from epithelia  <cit>  and since placodes  arise from epithelia . however, in some species , the bony canals are present prior to neuromast formation . earlier researchers argued that the neuromasts do not directly induce canal wall ossification, but change the mechanical  <cit>  and biochemical  <cit>  environment which triggers ossification. a large portion of this literature was based on inferences made from observations. only one study has directly tested this hypothesis in the cranial lateral line system of teleosts. devillers  ablated the neuromasts of the supraorbital canal in salmonids and observed abnormal morphogenesis of the frontal bone. more recently, in zebrafish, webb and shirey  <cit>  investigated the development of cranial lateral line canals and neuromasts in a growth series via sem and histology; they again hypothesized that neuromasts may induce the bony lateral line canal walls during the second stage of canal development when the neuromast sits in an epithelial groove for an extended period of time  <cit> , however no direct experimental evidence was provided. since this work, little further knowledge has been gained on the relationship between bony lateral line canals and their associated neuromasts. in the trunk lateral line system, however, interactions between posterior lateral line and scale formation have been previously tested and results suggest that lateral line cells play an important role in canal formation in killifish   <cit>  and goldfish   <cit> . also, recently in zebrafish  wada et al.  <cit>  investigated the development of the trunk lateral line system. similar to killifish and goldfish, lateral line cells are required for the formation of canals in the zebrafish posterior lateral line. these results suggest that there are mutual interactions during development between the sensory cells of the lateral line and the hard connective tissues of the scales.

here, we investigate the development and growth of the zebrafish infraorbital bones and the relationship between these bones and the lateral line canal neuromasts in the head. these relationships will be elucidated through the completion of two main objectives. first, we aim to investigate the developmental robustness of the io bones and to determine whether individual developing infraorbital bones affect the development and/or growth of neighbouring io bones. developmental robustness refers to the ability for a phenotype of an organism to remain on a developmental pathway despite variation in or perturbation of an environmental or genetic parameter  <cit> . we conducted targeted laser ablation of single io skeletogenic condensations in the io series and then analysed the results over a period of three months. we hypothesize that io series is robust and following laser condensation ablation some recovery of the element will occur in order to maintain the io series. if the io series is not robust then limited or no recovery of the io bones will follow condensation ablation. we also hypothesize that individual developing io bones will affect the development and/or growth of neighbouring io bones based on work in the chicken scleral ossicle system. second, we aimed to directly test whether developing canal neuromasts influence the development of the bony canal walls surrounding them through targeted ablation of selected io primary neuromasts prior to io canal formation. we hypothesize that, similar to the trunk lateral line canals, developmental interactions between the sensory cells of the neuromast and the hard tissue of the infraorbital bone canals are required for formation of the infraorbital lateral line canal.

RESULTS
to determine the role that individual bones play in the development of adjacent bones in the io series, we compared short and long-term results of targeted skeletogenic condensation ablation experiments. we analysed the targeted element, control elements  and control fish via gross morphology and shape analyses. we also analysed the effect on the adjacent bones. short-term results were collected on anesthetized juvenile specimens over the two-month period immediately following skeletogenic ablation, whereas long-term results were collected once specimens had reached adulthood  and were fixed. this type of long term study involving ablation at juvenile stages and analyses at multiple time-points during development to adulthood is rarely conducted because fish naturally die during the grow-out phases. our second objective was to test whether developing canal  neuromasts influence the development of the bony canal walls surrounding them through targeted ablation of neuromasts prior to io canal formation. for these analyses additional fish were used; these fish underwent neuromast ablation at larval and juvenile stages to determine whether neuromast ablation affects infraorbital bone development. for all experiments, we targeted our analyses to infraorbital three through five which are second  and third  in the io bone series to form. skeletal condensation ablations were performed on io <dig> with follow-up on io4-io <dig> to determine whether the neighbouring bone was affected. neuromast ablations were performed on io3-io <dig> canal neuromasts with follow-up on io3-io <dig> bones.

the infraorbital condensation recovers from ablation and the series is unaffected
to investigate the role that an individual io bone plays in the development of the io series the io <dig> condensation  was ablated using the nitrogen laser ablation system previously established by berns et al.,  <cit>  and used to target vertebrate cells  . similarly, at 24 hours post-ablation the ablated condensation is still not visible ; however, by 4 days post-ablation the io <dig> condensation has reformed  . this io <dig> condensation is smaller when compared to the io <dig> condensation on the control side  . in addition, it is closer to the adjacent io <dig> bone and appears to pinch off from the io <dig> element via a narrow bridge of bone tissue . by two weeks post-ablation the difference in size between the experimental and control-side io <dig> elements is still evident . overall, the recovered io <dig> appears smaller and truncated in the dorsal-ventral length compared to the control side. at this age, a morphological difference is also observed in the lateral line canal wall; the recovered io <dig> bone lacks distinct canal walls whereas in the control io <dig> element, the canal walls approach one another. similarly, at two months, the reformed io <dig> element appears morphologically different from the control io <dig> in three out of the four specimens . unlike control io <dig> elements , the reformed io <dig> element in affected specimens  does not possess the prominent bend in the canal region nor the flat, wing-like extension . the delay in canal wall formation is also still apparent. this difference persists into the long-term, such that by adulthood , the recovered io <dig> bone is still truncated, has a less bent canal as well as a smaller wing-like extension compared to the control side and unablated specimens. in the fourth specimen, the io <dig> bone is similar in shape and size to control io <dig> bones and possess both the flat-wing aspect and outgrown canal walls. no difference in the development of the other io bones  in the series was observed when compared to the time-points we recently described  <cit> . these results demonstrate that  an infraorbital condensation can recover from ablation within 1- <dig> days;  that the recovered condensation develops into smaller bones when compared to controls, and  that the adjacent bones in the series are unaffected. we hypothesize that this recovery mechanism is similar in all the io bones in the series; however, this response remains to be tested for each individual io bone.figure  <dig>

following these analyses and to further quantify the observed gross morphological differences in adult io <dig> shape after ablation, a shape analysis was performed using the shape software program. shape analysis enables a quantitative evaluation of biological contour shape based on elliptic fourier descriptors   <cit> . the contours of ablation, control-side and control io <dig> elements were compared in this analysis . the first three principle components  cumulatively contribute to over 70% of the total variance in io <dig> contour. following visualization in prinprint, the morphological meaning associated with each principal component was delineated. the first principle component  corresponds to the relationship between the anterior-posterior width compared to the dorsal-ventral length and accounts for 37% of the total variance . the second principle component  corresponds to the size of the flat, wing-like aspect of the bone and accounts for 22% of the variance . finally, accounting for only 14% of the variance is the third principle component , which describes the severity of the lateral line canal bend . a scatter plot  of the first two principal components shows a tight cluster of three of the four ablation specimens with the fourth ablation specimen located amongst both the control and control-side specimens. these three ablation specimens have pc <dig> scores corresponding to a wider element , as well as pc <dig> scores that correspond to truncated  elements with smaller flat wing-like extensions . control elements have pc <dig> and pc <dig> scores related to mean  and negative scores . to analyze this observed grouping, 95% confidence ellipses were added to the scatter plot . the confidence ellipses of all treatment groups overlap to some extent; however three of the four ablation specimens form a tight cluster away from all but one control-side specimen. this overlap is most likely due to the small sample size and occurrence of outliers. no clusters are observed along pc <dig> as ablation, control-side and control io <dig> elements were evenly distributed amongst one another along this axis . in summary, the shape analysis results reveal that ablated condensations develop into io <dig> bones in adults and are differ in morphology from control-side and control  io <dig> elements suggesting that skeletogenesis recovers after ablation.figure  <dig>

furthermore, in order to determine whether the ablation of io <dig> condensation affected the neighbouring adult io <dig> element, additional shape analysis on io <dig> was conducted. the contours of ablation, control-side and control io <dig> elements were compared . the first two principle components cumulatively contribute to over 80% of the total variance . as for io <dig>  following visualization in prinprint, the morphological meaning associated with each principal component was deduced. the first two principal components correspond to the flat, wing-like extension of the io <dig> bone. scatter plots of the first two principal components show no specific groupings of ablation and control specimens  indicating that io <dig> condensation ablation does not affect the shape of the adjacent io <dig> elements. that is, the rest of the io bone series is normal.

infraorbital canal neuromasts recover from targeted ablation
in order to determine whether io canal neuromasts can recover from ablation and if there are subsequent effects on io bone canal wall formation, io neuromasts were ablated at both larval and juvenile time-points in the io3- io <dig> bones . in larval fish, immediately following the io <dig> and io <dig> neuromast ablation, there are no visible signs of the ablated neuromast nor are there signs of re-growth 24 hours post-ablation  . at 5 days post-ablation the neuromast reformed, however it appears smaller  compared to before ablation . to determine whether io neuromasts of juvenile specimens would respond in the same way, io <dig> and io <dig> canal neuromasts were ablated at a time point preceding the suggested time  of neuromast induction of canal wall ossification  <cit> . similarly, in juveniles, immediately following the io <dig> neuromast ablation there is no visible sign of the ablated neuromast  . also 24 hours after this, io <dig> neuromast ablation at juvenile stages , no neuromasts are observed, however by four days post-ablation the neuromast reformed and is similar in morphology to controls. the same results were observed in io <dig>  neuromast ablation experiments. these results demonstrate that canal neuromasts can recover from targeted ablation and that the recovery rate is different depending on the age of the fish at the time of ablation.figure  <dig>

in order to confirm that tissues surrounding the targeted neuromast were not damaged during the ablation procedure we conducted histological and tunel staining. one hour following ablation, the neuromast shows evidence of damage but the surrounding tissues appear normal in section . tunel staining conducted three days post-ablation shows that cell death is observed in the neuromast but not in surrounding tissues . this finding agrees with previous studies that have used this technique  <cit> . no evidence of cell death was observed in controls .

neuromast ablation affects canal wall mineralization but not bone shape
to determine whether canal neuromasts are involved in the induction of the bony canals that enclose the lateral line system of the infraorbital bones, the extent of canal closure was measured in ablation and control specimens. canal closure was significantly less in adult specimens that had received larval neuromast ablation compared to controls  =  <dig> , p < <dig> ; io <dig> bones t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; and io <dig> bones t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) . the extent of canal closure was also significantly less in adult specimens that had received the juvenile neuromast io <dig> neuromast ablation compared to controls . surprisingly, there is no significant difference when the neuromast of io <dig> bones were ablated at the juvenile stage. this is likely due to the differences in the timing of io <dig> versus io <dig> bone formation  <cit> , or because io <dig> has a smaller canal compared to io <dig>  overall, these results suggest that there is a relationship between neuromasts and lateral line canal wall ossification and that the role of neuromasts in canal wall outgrowth may be temporally dependent on the stage of bone development at the time of ablation or on the length of the canal.figure  <dig>

to analyze the shape of io bones between neuromast ablation and control specimens another shape analysis was performed using the contour of the entire element . these analyses were performed on for each ablation experiment separately . for the larval neuromast ablation experiment the contour shape of io3-io <dig> were compared between ablation and control specimens. no specific groupings between ablation and control specimens were observed . for all ios analysed, the first three principal components described at least 85% of the variation in shape . the first principal component accounts for more than 50% of the variation and corresponds to the outgrowth of the flat-wing aspect of elements. for the juvenile io <dig> neuromast ablation experiment the contour of io <dig> elements were compared between ablation and control specimens. the first three principal components account for more than 90% of the variance in element shape . the first principal component accounts for more than 40% of this variation and represents the taper direction of the flat-wing aspect of the element. analysis of the juvenile io <dig> neuromast ablation specimens involved comparing the contour of io <dig> elements between ablation and control specimens. results from this analysis show that the first three principal components explain more than 85% of the element shape variance . the first principal component accounts for more than 40% of the variance and corresponds to the bend in the lateral line canal. for both juvenile ablation experiments, when plotted, no specific groupings are observed between ablation and control specimens . altogether, results from the neuromast ablation experiments demonstrate that canal wall outgrowth is affected by neuromast ablation; however the overall element shape is not affected.table  <dig>

discussion
this study investigates the development of the neural crest derived, intramembranous, infraorbital bones of the zebrafish . we conducted a series of skeletogenic condensation and neuromast laser ablation experiments, in order to investigate both the development of bones in a series and the highly debated inductive potential of canal neuromasts. the results of this study highlight the developmental robustness of the infraorbital bones in zebrafish.

infraorbital bone series can rescue from ablation and exhibit modularity
in order to investigate the development of intramembranous bones in a series, we ablated io <dig> condensations at  <dig> - <dig>  mm sl. we show that five days following ablation, the ablated condensation re-appears and appears to bud off the adjacent io <dig> condensation . interestingly, io <dig> is the next element to undergo osteogenesis in the io series. this suggests that the recovery mechanism observed in the io series maybe similar to that observed in the chick scleral ossicle system  <cit>  where removal of one bone in the series results in expansion of the next bone in the series. this observed recovery mechanism of a series of intramembranous bones might be shared by all vertebrates and is very intriguing. alternatively, the reformed io <dig> element may arise due to increased osteoblast proliferation and differentiation of a few cells as shown by willems et al.,  <cit> . in this study  <cit> , osteoblasts were targeted and ablated using a cytotoxic agent and following ablation new osteoblasts gradually appeared suggesting that the skeletogenic cell lineage may possess regenerative properties in medakas. it is possible therefore that in our experiments a similar regenerative mechanism of osteoblasts may be involved following condensation ablation. altogether, bone recovery following ablation presents an interesting scenario involving natural developmental rescue mechanisms that exist in the fish skeletal system. more research is needed to enhance our understanding of these mechanisms. these long-term experiments are time consuming and therefore rarely conducted yet can be quite informative as they provide valuable insight into relationships between the development of hard tissues to one another as well as interactions between soft  and hard tissues. understanding these mechanisms will enable us to understand the robustness of skeletal elements and their resistance to experimental perturbation and in nature as a result of environmental disturbances.

to evaluate adult morphology of the io bone after ablation, we conducted a bone shape analysis. our results show that the recovered adult io <dig> element is truncated  and the canals are shorter. it is known that multiple signalling events are involved in bone shape. for example, the frontonasal skeleton and beak in the chicken are formed through multiple, temporal- and spatially-specific changes of proliferative zones  <cit> . the outgrowth of the chick frontonasal mass is directed by fibroblast growth factors from the ectodermal zone  <cit> , whereas, the width of the beak has been shown to be regulated by the morphogen bmp- <dig>  <cit> . indeed, we have previously shown that two phases of io mineralization are present in the zebrafish io series. some io bones  form the flat bone aspect of the element prior to forming a canal, whereas others  form the canal aspect prior to the outgrowth of the flat, wing-like extension  <cit> . these data suggest that temporal and spatially-distinct patterning events may exist in io bone development. the reason for the resulting truncated io <dig> element after ablation may be because it ossifies slightly later than controls because it first has to recover from ablation. this delay could then affect the ossification and outgrowth of the dorsal aspect of the element. the condensation ablation data provided here further supports this hypothesis. that is, temporally distinct signalling events are involved in the development of the flat, wing-like extension of the bone that are distinct from those for the bony canal aspect of the io bone .

furthermore, we show that despite appearance that the recovered io <dig> buds off io <dig>  no difference in io <dig> shape in adults were found via shape analyses. the mechanism explaining this phenotype requires further investigation and is beyond the scope of the current study. although our sample size was limited for this part of the study, our data provides interesting insights into how intramembranous bones respond to perturbation over the long term.

ablated neuromasts recover faster from ablation in juveniles
various methods have been used to ablate neuromasts in vertebrates . following ablation, the recovery or regeneration of neuromasts has been reported in amphibians and zebrafish  either directly or indirectly. we hypothesize that the recovered neuromast probably reforms via proliferation of pre-mitotic precursor support cells.

by ablating neuromasts at different times during growth of the fish, we show that neuromast recovery occurs faster in juvenile specimens compared to larval specimens. one reason for this observation might be that hair cells are added to neuromasts over a life span  <cit> , and therefore there are too few premature precursor cells present at larval stages for rapid recovery. in addition, larval-fish that are dependent on their yolk for nutrients may have limited energy resources. further research is required to fully explain this observed difference in recovery rate between juvenile and larval fish.

neuromast ablation affects canal wall mineralization but not io shape
to evaluate the effect of ablation on canal wall development, we analysed canal wall outgrowth in ablation and control adult specimens. we show that following neuromast ablation, the outgrowth and closure of mineralized canal walls is significantly affected in larval and juvenile ablations supporting our hypothesis that neuromasts are involved in canal wall mineralization. surprisingly, we found that even when the neuromast ablation was conducted at the larval stage, 3- <dig> weeks prior to the hypothesized period of neuromast induction of canal walls  <cit> , the amount of canal wall mineralization in the resulting adult bones was significantly decreased. two potential mechanisms could explain these results. first, the neuromast ablation caused a decrease in inductive signals for canal wall formation due to the time required for the ablated neuromast to recover and this delay then translates into a lost period of signalling for mineralization. alternatively, the regenerated neuromast has a weaker inductive potential than the original neuromast and the inductive signal might not be able to travel as far in the tissue. for example, the observation of decreased canal wall mineralization in juvenile io <dig> neuromast ablation specimens, but not in io <dig> ablation specimens may be because io <dig> has a longer; a decrease in the strength of the inductive signal in recovered neuromasts would therefore affect io <dig> more. although, more research is required to fully understand the role neuromasts play in io canal mineralization, this study shows that io canal wall development is affected by canal neuromasts.

finally, in the neuromast ablation experiments, the overall shape of the adult ablated io bones was not affected suggesting that the flat bone portion is independent of the canal wall portion in these bones and supports a bi-modular developmental system. we previously showed that io bone development has two phases of bone development, a canal phase and a flat-wing phase, either of which can occur first  <cit> . we further hypothesized that infraorbital development may involve two developmental modules. modularity is the word coined to describe when parts of an organism are closely integrated and connected, more so with one another than with neighbouring modules . modules are therefore also hierarchical in nature. modularity in the cranial lateral line system of teleosts has recently also been discussed by  <cit> . recently, webb et al.  <cit>  showed that in lake malawi cichlids, the morphology of the lateral line canals and the dermal bones in which they are found can evolve independently of each other  <cit> . taken together, this data further supports the idea that the lateral line canal system of teleosts is modular.

in summary, we explored and tested the relationship between bones in the io series and the lateral line canal neuromasts. our results provide direct evidence that canal neuromasts play a role in the formation of canal walls. we further hypothesize that neuromast recovery occurs through proliferation of support cells resulting in a delay or change in the inductive potential of the recovered neuromast. more research is required to fully elucidate the inductive mechanism and extent of neuromast involvement in canal wall mineralization.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the io series of bones is a developmentally complex system that has remained together in skull ontogeny throughout evolution. clearly there must be developmental mechanisms in place to have maintained this bone series throughout  <dig> million years of evolution  <cit> . the results of this study highlight both the complexity and robustness of these bones. the mechanisms of developmental robustness in skeletogenesis have not received much attention in the literature yet these studies are critically important to increase our understanding of intramembranous bone patterning and growth. the canal neuromasts were shown to play a role in canal wall mineralization indicating that the io series is also an ideal system to further elucidate the interaction between hard and soft tissues.
