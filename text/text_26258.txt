BACKGROUND
the best-studied asymmetrically dividing prokaryote is the alphaproteobacterium caulobacter crescentus. at each cell division, predivisional cells of c. crescentus localize different structures at the cell poles: a single flagellum occupies the pole that will be inherited by the swarmer cell and pili are synthesized at this pole after division, whereas a narrow extension of the cell envelope  tipped by an adhesive structure  occupies the opposite pole that will give rise to the stalked cell. the stalked cell is able to restart the cell cycle immediately after division, whereas the swarmer cell is unable to initiate dna replication until it differentiates into a stalked cell.

the c. crescentus cell cycle and developmental program are controlled by three master regulators: ctra, gcra, and dnaa . these proteins are regulated such that each one reaches maximal abundance during a different stage of the cell cycle. dnaa reaches peak abundance at initiation of dna replication occurring in stalked cells, gcra peaks after dna replication in early predivisional cells, and ctra peaks in late predivisional and swarmer stages  <cit> . all three proteins are required for regulating transcription of different suites of genes. dnaa activates genes involved in chromosome partitioning, nucleotide biosynthesis, and dna replication, recombination and repair  <cit> , and initiates replication of the chromosome. dnaa is also required for transcription of gcra <cit> . gcra activates transcription of genes involved in dna replication, recombination and repair different from dnaa targets  <cit> . gcra also activates genes required for polar development . ctra, in turn, regulates at least  <dig> genes in  <dig> operons: some are repressed  whereas others are activated . additionally, ctra binds to the chromosome at the origin of replication where it represses the initiation of dna replication  <cit> . furthermore, ctra both activates and represses its own promoters.

the ctra gene has two promoters: p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . the weaker upstream p <dig> promoter is activated first. p <dig> activation requires that the promoter be in the hemi-methylated state, meaning that dna replication has initiated and the replication fork has passed the p <dig> promoter. the p <dig> promoter is also directly activated by gcra  <cit> . the low level of expression from the gcra-activated ctra p <dig> promoter allows some ctra protein to accumulate. once sufficient ctra has accumulated, it represses the p <dig> promoter  and activates the strong downstream p <dig> promoter  <cit> , leading to a burst of ctra production and activity.

the sequential activation of the master regulators forms the timeline by which developmental processes are regulated and coordinated. in particular, gcra contributes to the expression of the key developmental regulators, the histidine kinase plec and the polar localization factor podj. loss of either protein causes pleiotropic defects in development. a plec mutant does not synthesize a stalk, holdfast or pili, and though the flagellum is made, flagellar rotation is not activated and the flagellum is not shed during the swarmer cell differentiation  <cit> . a podj mutant, like plec, does not synthesize holdfast or pili or shed its flagellum, but it does synthesize a stalk and activates its flagellum, however its motility is impaired in low-percentage agar as compared to wild type  <cit> .

to further elucidate the pathways that lead to these pleiotropic phenotypes a genetic approach was used. we conducted a transposon mutagenesis screen, selecting for resistance to phage Φcbk, which requires pili for infection, and screening for defects in motility and adhesion, which require the flagellum and holdfast respectively. in this work we report the identification of a transposon insertion in the promoter region of ctra that causes a drastic reduction of ctra accumulation, resulting in pleiotropic phenotypes bearing similarities to the plec and podj phenotypes.

RESULTS
a transposon mutation causes a pleiotropic phenotype
c. crescentus wild-type strain cb <dig> was mutagenized with the mariner transposon and mutants resistant to the bacteriophage Φcbk were isolated to enrich for mutants defective in pilus synthesis. once isolated, mutants were microscopically examined to identify defects in the presence or placement of stalks, the formation of rosettes , or in swimming motility. strains exhibiting a defect in any of these features were further analyzed for motility defects on swarm plates. a total of  <dig> kanr Φcbkr mutants were screened and classified into  <dig> categories  based on these polar phenotypes . the majority of mutants  were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type when grown in pye liquid media , suggesting that they were pili synthesis mutants; these were not analyzed further. classes b, c and d had stalks, formed rosettes, and differed from each other only in their swarming phenotype, ranging from no swarming  to the formation of small swarms  and finally to moderate-sized swarms resembling those of a podj mutant . class e exhibited phenotypes identical to a podj mutant , and all were confirmed by southern analysis to have insertions in podj. class f resembled the known plec phenotype , and all mutants in this class were shown to have insertions in plec.

adetermined by visual identification in liquid culture. bdetermined by assaying motility of cells through low-percentage agar. phenotypes scored on a relative scale from fully motile  to non-motile . nd = not determined.

one mutant, m <dig> and later the transduced derivative yb <dig>  did not fit into any of the other classes. similar to podj mutants, this mutant produces moderate sized swarms , yet the morphology of the cells was variable and did not resemble podj mutant cells which exhibit normal morphology. analysis of the cell morphology of yb <dig> revealed that it had numerous deficiencies as compared to wild-type cb <dig> . cells displayed a moderate filamentation phenotype. a cell division defect was apparent in an increased percentage of cells with at least one visible constriction. in cb <dig> predivisional cells comprised 17% of the total population, whereas in yb <dig>  35% of the population was had at least one constriction. furthermore, the prevalence of cells with multiple constrictions was increased from less than 1% in cb <dig> to 3% of the total cell population  in yb <dig>  more severe defects were observed in stalk synthesis . in cb <dig>  91% of predivisional cells had a visible stalk as compared to only 32% in yb <dig>  staining of holdfast polysaccharide with fitc-wga indicated that 8% of predivisional cells of yb <dig> had a holdfast as compared to 74% of predivisional cb <dig> cells .

yb <dig> demonstrated similar phage resistance to Φcbk as podj in a phage sensitivity assay. when serial dilutions of cells were mixed with phage stock and spotted on pye plates , cell growth in lower dilutions was slightly less dense than that of the fully resistant podj mutant. however, relative to wild-type cells, yb <dig> exhibited significant phage resistance, allowing survival at the lower dilutions of phage. finally, yb <dig> grew more slowly than wild-type with a doubling time of  <dig> minutes as compared to  <dig> minutes .

yb <dig> transposon insertion is in the ctra regulatory region
mapping of the mutation in yb <dig> indicated that the transposon had inserted between the − <dig> and − <dig> sites of the ctra p <dig> promoter   <cit> , indicating that the pleitropic defects observed are not due to disruption of a polar development gene like podj or plec, but alteration of one of the master regulators directly. the exact site of insertion and the sequence of the end of the transposon were such that the − <dig> site remained somewhat intact. of the two ttaa half-sites required for ctra-binding  <cit> , one was slightly altered , and the other was completely abolished . the half site that was completely abolished is very likely necessary for efficient transcription of ctra-controlled promoters, including ctra itself. while the end of the transposon creates another half site, it is separated by an additional  <dig> bases from the first half site. previous mutational analysis of the consensus ctra recognition sequence revealed that the drastic alteration of either ttaa half site in the recognition sequence ttaa-n7-ttaa greatly reduces transcription of the promoter, and alteration of the downstream ttaa half site can also abolish cell-cycle regulation  <cit> . because yb <dig> does not have the complete recognition site essential for efficient induction of the p <dig> promoter by ctra, and the p <dig> promoter is separated from the translational start site by the full length of the transposon, we hypothesized that transcription of the ctra gene is reduced in the yb <dig> mutant, and the resultant reduction of ctra protein could be the cause of the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in this strain.

to verify this hypothesis, we generated a fusion of the ctra mutant promoter from yb <dig> to lacz and compared expression from this promoter to the wild-type ctra promoter in both cb <dig> and yb <dig> during exponential growth . expression from the mutant promoter was only 20% of wild-type ctra promoter expression in yb <dig> and 29% wild-type ctra promoter expression in the wild-type strain indicating that even when ctra is present and its activity is normal , the mutant promoter is not efficiently transcribed.

since the mutant ctra promoter  from yb <dig> demonstrated reduced activity in wild-type, suggesting ctra transcription is reduced in yb <dig>  western blot analysis was performed to measure ctra abundance. results showed that ctra is expressed at a much lower level in yb <dig> than in cb <dig> . subsequent quantification of band intensities from six western blots showed that ctra is present at approximately  <dig> +/− 5% of the wild-type cb <dig> level, demonstrating that the reduced transcription resulting from the transposon insertion leads to drastically lower ctra protein levels.

polar development defects are linked to altered ctra abundance/activity
in order to determine if the lower ctra levels are involved in the polar development defects found in yb <dig>  similar assays that were performed on yb <dig> were also performed on ctra <dig>  a temperature sensitive ctra allele  <cit> . at the restrictive temperature the allele is lethal, but at the permissive temperature ctra-dependent promoters demonstrate altered transcription patterns that indicate that ctra <dig> has impaired function. phenotypic analysis demonstrates that a ctra <dig> mutant has a reduced swarming phenotype , as well as morphological defects , both of which mirror those of yb <dig> 

plasmid psal <dig> was introduced into yb <dig>  creating strain yb <dig>  psal <dig> is a low copy plasmid carrying a copy of the ctra gene with its native promoter  <cit> . introduction of the plasmid restored ctra production to slightly above wild-type levels . phenotypic analysis of yb <dig> demonstrated that ctra complementation restores cell morphology  and holdfast synthesis  to wild-type phenotypes, and growth rate to near wild-type levels . phage sensitivity was increased over that of the parent yb <dig> , but not complemented to full wild-type levels . interestingly, ctra complementation appears to have no effect on the swarming defect of yb <dig> . the causal relationship between reduced ctra abundance and the reduced swarming phenotype in this mutant is unknown.

effect of the ctra promoter mutation on transcription of developmentally regulated genes
though expression of the mutant ctra promoter was reduced regardless of the strain harboring it , the wild-type ctra promoter displayed similar expression levels when placed in yb <dig>  indicating its activity is resistant to the severe reduction in ctra protein levels in that strain. given that ctra is a global regulatory protein for both essential  and non-essential  genes, and that the drastic ctra reduction in yb <dig> leads to polar developmental defects but the strain is still viable, we hypothesized that transcription of ctra-regulated genes essential for cell survival will be less affected by ctra reduction in yb <dig> than those that are essential for less important cellular functions. thus we investigated the transcription level of several ctra-regulated genes in cb <dig> and yb <dig> 

plasmids bearing transcriptional lacz fusions were introduced into both wild type and yb <dig> strains. the promoters for the reporter constructs were ctra , ctra p <dig>  ctra p <dig> , ftsz , ftsqa , ccrm , fliq  and pila  as well as lacz under the control of a xylose inducible promoter to serve as a negative control . exponential phase cultures were assayed for β-galactosidase activity . total transcriptional activity from the ctra promoter was unaffected, though there was a reduction of activity from the weak p <dig> promoter, but not the stronger p <dig>  activity from these promoters is dependent upon many factors, one of them being ctra protein abundance. it is possible that even though ctra abundance in yb <dig> is severely reduced, it is more than enough to activate the p <dig> promoter.

ftsz and ftsqa promoters had a moderate reduction in activity, and the ccrm promoter had a slight reduction in activity. these genes are essential for viability. the moderate reduction in transcription for these genes agrees with the hypothesis that genes involved in essential cell cycle processes would not be severely affected by the reduction in ctra in yb <dig>  in contrast, the pila promoter exhibited a drastic decrease in activity, as would be expected given the selection by which this mutant was obtained. however, activity from the fliq promoter  was largely unaffected. it is not clear why this promoter is unaffected while the pila promoter shows such a difference in activity. it could be that the pila promoter is much more sensitive to ctra levels.

regulation of pila is controlled not only by ctra, but by scip. scip interacts with ctra to prevent transcription of genes positively regulated by ctra, such as pila, in swarmer and late predivisional cells  <cit> . it is possible that the dramatic decrease in pila promoter activity in yb <dig> is not from ctra abundance itself, but an indirect effect of reduced ctra abundance leading to increased scip activity. however, ctra positively regulates transcription of scip and the strong reduction of ctra activity in the yb <dig> mutant should lead to a decrease in scip levels, not an increase. in agreement with this hypothesis it has been shown that a site-directed mutation that abolishes transcription from the ctra p <dig> promoter caused a strong reduction of ctra abundance  <cit> , similar to that of the yb <dig> mutation in this study, and this lead to significantly reduced expression of scip, down to 19% of wild-type level  <cit> . the ctra p <dig> mutant also had morphological and growth defects similar to those found here, and several assays demonstrated that ccrm transcription and translation was largely unaffected, agreeing with our results. therefore it is unlikely that the effects observed on gene expression are the result of increased scip activity.

some ctra-dependent promoters appear more resilient to changes in ctra concentration than others. it has been shown previously that promoters that deviate from the canonical ttaa-n7-ttaa ctra binding site have a lower ctra binding affinity  <cit> . it is possible promoters that are more susceptible to changes in ctra concentration have more divergent ctra binding sites, causing them to have lower ctra affinity and thus lower binding site occupancy at lower ctra concentrations such as found in yb <dig>  a list of ctra binding sites from each of the transcriptional fusions used in figure  <dig>  is shown in table  <dig>  the ctra binding region for each gene was determined experimentally by dna footprinting . the ctra-p <dig>  ccrm and fliq reporters displayed the least change in yb <dig> compared to wild-type, indicating expression from these promoters is more resilient to changes in ctra concentration. the ctra-p <dig> site is well characterized as ttaa-n6-ttaa with an additional ttaa half site  <dig> bp downstream. this binding site is relatively close to the canonical structure. the binding sites for ccrm and fliq are ttaa-n7-ctaa and ctaa-n7-ttaa respectively. each binding site differs from the canonical structure by a single base pair substitution. therefore, the promoters displaying little change in yb <dig> all are relatively similar to the known ctra binding sequence. the ctra-p <dig>  ftsz, pila and to a lesser extent ftsqa fusions all displayed noticeable changes in expression in yb <dig> compared to wild-type. the ctra-p <dig> binding site consists of a single ttaa half site and obviously diverges greatly from the consensus ctra binding site. the ftsqa site is ttaa-n7-ctaa, the same as the ccrm binding site, though ftsqa only displays a moderate change in transcription inyb <dig>  however, the ftsz promoter region, which shows the second largest transcriptional change in yb <dig>  has a perfectly canonical ttaa-n7-ttaa binding site. therefore it is unlikely that varying promoter affinities due to divergence from the consensus ctra binding site can fully explain the changes  for ctra-dependent promoters in yb <dig>  though they may still contribute.

ttaa half sites are indicated in bold.

though the genes used for analysis in this study mostly have single ctra-binding sites close to the consensus, the pila gene, which displays drastically reduced transcription in yb <dig> compared to wild-type, appears different compared to the other genes presented in regards to ctra regulation. ctra was shown to the bind to three distinct regions in the pila promoter area. region  <dig> has a ttta-n7-ttaa binding site straddling the − <dig> site. region  <dig>   <dig> bp upstream of region  <dig>  has two potential ctra binding sites, ttaa-n6-ataa and taaa-n6-taaa, separated by  <dig> bp. region  <dig>   <dig> bp upstream of region  <dig>  has a single tcaa-n7-ctaa binding site. though the region  <dig> binding site is relatively close to the consensus sequence, all the other binding sites diverge greatly from the consensus in sequence and/or half-site spacing. clearly ctra regulation of pila is more complex than that of the other genes presented. perhaps the divergent binding sites have low affinity for ctra and the multiple weak binding sites create cooperative ctra binding necessary to achieve maximal pila expression. it would be plausible that this scenario  would be quite sensitive to changes in ctra protein levels, leading to the drastic reduction in transcription seen in yb <dig>  further analysis of ctra regulation of pila will prove informative.

is it possible that promoters more susceptible to changes in ctra concentration/activity account for all the pleiotropic defects observed in podj and plec strains? current understanding of plec’s role  in developmental signaling is to regulate phosphorylation levels of another signaling protein divk, which in turn regulates the activity of the ccka phosphorelay that controls ctra activation  <cit> . a plec mutant should have reduced ctra levels, similar to the ctra phenotype found in this study. though ctra protein levels in plec are similar to wild-type, there is a significant decrease in ctra phosphorylation  <cit> . also in agreement with this hypothesis, reduced ctra levels have been implicated as contributing to the null-pili phenotype of podj mutants  <cit> . however, the other polar development phenotypes are not as well explained by ctra-promoter effects. the known link between ctra and flagellar motility in c. crescentus is that ctra initiates the flagellum synthesis cascade  <cit> . the fliq-lacz reporter demonstrates that the synthesis cascade is unaffected, which agrees with the fact that both plec and podj mutants produce flagella. ctra must affect motility in a way other than synthesis of the flagellum, possibly two ways since the flagellum is paralyzed in a plec mutant but capable of rotation in a podj mutant. the effect of ctra on motility appears to be independent of ctra abundance as complementation of ctra abundance by psal <dig> failed to restore wild-type motility to yb <dig> . if the effect is not dependent on ctra abundance, it may be dependent on timing of ctra activity. expression from the mutant promoter in yb <dig> is likely constitutive, and may lead to early induction of whatever ctra-dependent pathway is involved in motility other than flagellum synthesis. however, the ccka/chpt pathway that controls ctra activity should not be perturbed in this mutant, so even though ctra could be produced constitutively, its activity should still be properly regulated. the full link between ctra and motility is still a mystery.

the connection between ctra and holdfast synthesis is also not clear. while it is known that at least some of the holdfast synthesis genes display changes in transcription activity during the cell cycle  <cit> , and microarray experiments have shown that holdfast genes have altered transcription in a ctra mutant  <cit> , it has also been shown that holdfast synthesis can be stimulated in swarmer cells when they contact a surface  <cit> , and that developmental holdfast synthesis is also likely regulated by cyclic-di-gmp levels  <cit> . we have recently shown that the holdfast synthesis and anchoring machineries are synthesized and polarly localized in predivisional cells in preparation for holdfast synthesis in the next cell cycle  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that ctra regulates the synthesis of the holdfast synthesis-anchoring machinery in predivisional cells, but that the activation of this machinery is regulated by surface contact and developmental signals. the additional possibility that ctra abundance effects post-transcriptional regulation of holdfast synthesis cannot be ruled out. however, both effects on motility and post-transcriptional effects on holdfast synthesis could be downstream effects of ctra-dependent decrease in promoter activity of one or more other regulators.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we performed a detailed mutagenesis selection/screen to identify new regulators that control multiple aspects of polar development similar to known developmental regulators plec and podj. our results suggest that potential regulators downstream of those already known may be essential, redundant or branched. in the process we found evidence that suggests at least some of the pleiotrophic phenotypes are the result different affinities between ctra and ctra-dependent promoters.
