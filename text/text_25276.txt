BACKGROUND
the ventral tegmental area  comprises several subdivisions including the paranigral , parabrachial  or interfascicular  nuclei  <cit> . neurons synthesizing neurotransmitters, such as dopamine , gaba or glutamate among others coexist in these vta divisions  <cit> . the mesocortical system, which is strongly involved in cognitive behavior, eeg activation and arousal, is formed by vta projections to areas of the cerebral cortex located mainly in the medial surface of the frontal lobe  <cit> . vta neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex  are distributed throughout both the pbp and pn  <cit> . although much emphasis has been placed on the dopaminergic mesocortical system in previous studies, some reports indicate that gaba-containing vta neurons also project to the mpfc  <cit> . moreover, gabaergic vta neurons are active during wakefulness  <cit> . vta stimulation produces inhibition of cortical pyramidal neurons through activation of both gaba cortical interneurons and gaba mesocortical vta neurons  <cit> . however, systematic studies assessing the relative contributions of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons to the mesocortical pathway reaching mpfc have not been addressed so far.

hypothalamic neurons containing the peptides hypocretins/orexins  project widely to the vta . the hcrt/ox peptide family involved in sleep-wakefulness regulation comprises two peptides: hcrt1/oxa and hcrt2/oxb. hcrt1/oxa binds to hcrt/ox-r <dig> and hcrt/ox-r <dig>  both of which are present in vta neurons  <cit> . deficient actions of hcrt/ox due to either degeneration of hcrt/ox neurons or breakdown of hcrt/ox signaling pathways result in the chronic sleep disorder narcolepsy, which is characterized by inability to maintain prolonged periods of wakefulness . furthermore, hcrt/ox neurons discharge maximally in wakefulness, decrease their activity in slow wave sleep and cease firing during rem sleep  <cit> .

intracerebroventricular hcrt/ox increase mpfc da release and neuronal activity, and thereby arousal  <cit> . moreover, hcrt1/oxa infusion in the vta increases wakefulness and decreases sleep  <cit> . hcrt1/oxa application in vitro enhances vta neuron activity  <cit> , suggesting that hcrt1/oxa excites the mpfc partly though activation of mesocortical vta neurons.

a  <dig> study has reported the existence of only a few synapses between hcrt1/oxa axons and vta neurons; some of these neurons were identified as either dopaminergic or gabaergic  <cit> . thus, hcrt1/oxa could affect vta function synaptically, but also perhaps through non-synaptic actions that have been reported typical of peptidergic transmission  <cit> . here we hypothesize that some of those neurons targeted by hcrt1/oxa axons belong to the mesocortical pathway. nevertheless, there are no ultrastructural studies about particular relationships between hcrt1/oxa axons and vta neurons projecting unambiguously to mpfc, and the definite targeting of mesocortical neurons by hcrt1/oxa axons has not been assessed yet.

here we determine: 1) the comparative contribution of vta dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons to mesocortical projections to mpfc; 2) the ultrastructural distribution of hcrt1/oxa in the vta; and 3) the cellular relationships of hcrt1/oxa-containing axons with vta neurons projecting to mpfc. the results obtained identify ultrastructural bases for hypocretinergic activation of vta mesocortical neurons and improveour understanding of the anatomical linkages supporting the well-known wake-enhancing and cortical activation actions of hcrt1/oxa at the vta.

RESULTS
injection sites
the animals were classified in three groups according to the mpfc injection sites. the first group comprised ten animals with fluorogold  injections located exclusively in the prelimbic sector  of mpfc . in another eight animals, the fg deposit also included either the medial orbital sector  or the cingular sector  of mpfc. in sixteen animals, the retrograde tracer stained all layers of the cerebral cortex; in one animal  the fg deposit was mainly in superficial layers  and in another animal  the fg injection was confined to layers i-v .figure  <dig>

single immunochemical detection of fluorogold
all the animals had fg-immunolabeled neurons in vta, but these neurons were also observed in some other brainstem regions such as the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. a few fg-immunoreactive neurons were also found in the pedunculopontine nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, caudal linear nucleus and median and pontine raphe nuclei .

fg-immunoreactivity was observed in cell bodies and dendrites of vta multipolar neurons . the fg-immunolabeled neurons were largely localized in the vta ipsilateral to the injection site . the ipsilateral versus contralateral distribution of fg retrogradely-labeled neurons was quite alike in the three injection groups , and fg-labeled neurons were significantly more frequent in ipsilateral than contralateral vta in the three injection site groups . in most of the animals , fg-immunolabeled neurons were evident throughout the entire rostro-caudal extension of the vta, although in the remaining three animals  they were only observed in rostral vta. moreover, retrograde-labeled neurons were more frequent in the parabrachial subdivision  than in the paranigral subdivision  of the vta . lower proportions of fg-labeled neurons were observed in the interfascicular subdivision  of the vta  and in rostral and caudal linear raphe nuclei . fg-immunoreactive neurons were more densely grouped in medial and ventral portions of vta. this distribution pattern for fg neurons in the different vta subnuclei was independent of the injection site .table  <dig>

the distribution and morphology of the fg-immunofluorescent neurons in mpfc-injected animals were very similar to those described above observed using the immunoperoxidase technique , and did not differ significantly with injection site . the location of fg-labeled neurons in the different subdivisions of vta was similar to the location observed using immunohistochemical staining .figure  <dig>

single immunochemical detection of hcrt1/oxa
midbrain sections from four rats without an fg injection in mpfc were immunolabeled for hcrt1/oxa. hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive axons were observed throughout the whole rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral extents of the vta, as has been previously described  <cit> . hcrt1/oxa containing axons were scattered enough to make it possible to distinguish their varicosities and axon trail quite easily . the diameter of hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive varicosities was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm,  as measured with imagej software at 100× magnification , whereas intervaricose hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive segments were always less than  <dig>  μm wide.figure  <dig>

dual immunohistochemical detection of fluorogold and hcrt1/oxa
observation of the tissue sections dually labeled for fg and hcrt1/oxa only showed that a very few fg retrograde-labeled neurons and hcrt1/oxa containing varicosities were apposed to each other in the same focal plane at light microscope level , suggesting that cellular contacts might be unusual between fg-immunoreactive neurons and hcrt1/oxa-labeled axons in the vta.

six animals with pl injections were analyzed for dual fg- and hcrt1/oxa-labeling with the electron microscope. fg peroxidase immunoreaction product was observed in the cytoplasm, multivesicular bodies and lysosomes of cell bodies and dendrites. hcrt1/oxa was only found in axonal profiles. hcrt1/oxa-immunoprecipitate was observed in the cytoplasm, in dense-cored vesicles  and in large dense-cored vesicles , usually filling the profiles completely . however, in some axons hcrt1/oxa was exclusively observed in vesicles and/or discrete portions of the cytoplasm . hcrt1/oxa-containing axons were detected throughout the whole thickness of the vta sections, indicating optimum antiserum penetration. there were no significant variations in hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive axon area density  between animals  or ultrathin sections . these findings demonstrate that hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactivity in our sample was quite homogeneous. most axonal profiles that contained hcrt1/oxa were unmyelinated axons  and some profiles were varicosities . there were also a few axon terminals . three animals  showed a few hcrt1/oxa myelinated axons . the distribution of the different axonal profile types  in a sample that contained all the profile types of hcrt1/oxa axons and in another sample containing only axons with a circularity ≥  <dig>  was not significantly different . this shows that the criterion used for measuring axon diameter was a good estimate of their real diameter, thus validating the utilization of the whole axonal sample.figure  <dig>

unmyelinated hcrt1/oxa-immunolabeled axons were mainly sectioned on a transverse plane , but they were also sometimes observed in non-transverse or longitudinal cross-sectioned planes . the anova test showed that there were no significant variations between animals regarding the preferential transverse sectioning of hcrt1/oxa axons  . longitudinally-sectioned unmyelinated hcrt1/oxa-labeled axons frequently showed dcv and ldcv. most hcrt1/oxa-labeled axons were grouped with other axons in bundles within the neuropil and did not make contacts with vta profiles, suggesting that they would mainly be en passant fibers traversing the vta towards other brain regions. hcrt1/oxa-immunolabeled axonal boutons were also mostly cut transversely  in our ultrathin sections, and there were no statistical differences between animals in the preferential transverse sectioning of hcrt1/oxa containing boutons  . the varicosities were the main hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive axonal bouton type , and their percentage was fairly uniform in all the animals .

a small percentage of hcrt1/oxa-containing axons established cellular contacts  with cellular bodies or dendrites of vta neurons . hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive axonal boutons preferentially made appositional contacts with vta dendrites , most of which were unlabeled. in those cases in which synaptic specializations were evident, they were asymmetric , and mainly formed with unlabeled dendrites , but contacts were also established with fg-labeled dendrites . moreover, we observed one axo-somatic and one axo-axonic synapse with unlabeled profiles.figure  <dig>

appositional contacts and synapses established by hcrt1/oxa profiles in the ventral tegmental area


raw numbers of appositional contacts and synapses made by hcrt1/oxa axonal profiles in the ventral tegmental area with either fluorogold -labeled or unlabeled dendrites. data were collected from  <dig> vibratome sections processed for dual labeling  in  <dig> rats that had been injected with fg in the prelimbic sector of the medial prefrontal cortex.
cellular contacts established by hcrt1/oxa-containing axons in the ventral tegmental area.  hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactivity is seen in large dense-cored vesicles , dense-cored vesicles  and in the cytoplasm of a varicosity  that makes an asymmetric synapse  with a fluorogold-labeled dendrite . the fg-den is identified by its content in dab-immunoperoxidase reaction product .  hcrt1/oxa-v establishes an asymmetric synapse  with a fg-dendrite that receives convergent input from an unlabeled axon terminal .  a vta dendrite  receives a synaptic contact  from an hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive varicosity  and an unlabeled ter.  hcrt1/oxa-t makes an asymmetric synapse  on an unlabeled den. hcrt1/oxa-t contains translucent small synaptic vesicles  near the synaptic specialization while dcv are far from the synapse.  bar graph showing the relative percentage of appositional and synaptic contacts  established by hcrt1/oxa-boutons with unlabeled-  or fg-labeled  dendrites according to the type of axonal bouton  in the ventral tegmental area. mean percentages and standard errors were calculated based on the numbers obtained from  <dig> hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive boutons in  <dig> vibratome sections from six rat brains.  bar graph showing the percentage distribution of unlabeled and fluorogold-labeled  dendrites of different sizes receiving asymmetric synapses  from hcrt1/oxa-immunolabeled axonal boutons  in the ventral tegmental area. mean percentages and standard errors were calculated based on the numbers obtained from the synapse-recipient  <dig> dendrites in  <dig> ultrathin sections from  <dig> rat brains. anova  was done to determine in those dendrites significant variations in the formation of asymmetric synapses with respect to their small , intermediate  or large  diameters . scale bar,  <dig>  μm.

the presence of cellular contacts made by hcrt1/oxa-immunolabeled boutons was frequently associated with a given morphological type of axonal bouton . hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive axon terminals established about twice as many cellular contacts  as hcrt1/oxa-immunolabeled varicosities. furthermore, analysis of the synaptic proportions with respect to all cellular contacts made by both types of bouton , showed that hcrt1/oxa-labeled axon terminals made more synapses than varicosities . thus, hcrt1/oxa axon terminals preferentially formed asymmetric synapses while hcrt1/oxa varicosities mainly established appositional contacts . this association between axonal bouton type  and cellular contact type  was assessed using the chi-square test for the raw number of contacts made by hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive boutons . most of the dendrites that established asymmetric synapses with hcrt1/oxa-labeled boutons had a mean diameter greater than  <dig>  μm , suggesting they were close to the neuronal somata. we only observed one hcrt1/oxa varicosity that formed a synapse with an unlabeled dendrite that had a diameter less than  <dig>  μm. some dendrites that established synapses with hcrt1/oxa boutons also received inputs from unlabeled axon terminals that made cellular contacts  with fg-labeled dendrites.

a few hcrt1/oxa-containing unmyelinated axons, most of them transversely-sectioned, formed appositional contacts  with vta dendrites . in only two rats  did these axons make some asymmetric synapses onto dendrites . furthermore, hcrt1/oxa-containing axons were close to blood vessels or even in contact with the vascular glia limitans . in our sample, around 2% of the hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive axons were located at a distance of less than  <dig>  μm from the vascular basal membrane ; approximately half of these axons close to blood vessels were boutons .figure  <dig>

discussion
the hcrt/ox system sustains arousal  <cit>  and supports the transition of sleep-wakefulness cycle states  <cit> . in the present study, we suggest that some of these hcrt/ox functions could be mediated by their actions on vta neurons  that project to the mpfc. furthermore, we demonstrate that non-dopaminergic neurons constitute a major source of the mesocortical pathway to mpfc.

methodological considerations
the tracer fg was used because it can be retrogradely transported to neuronal somata that are a long distance from the tracer deposit, and it can be detected by different immunohistochemical techniques that amplify the fg signal  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that some axon terminals did not take up the fg and the retrogradely-labeled neurons would be underestimated. injection parameters such as current intensity, duration of injection and micropipette tip diameter were the optimal to obtain small injections that would include all cortical layers without producing cortical lesions. all antisera used have a high specificity and have been used in previous studies  <cit> . moreover, omission of the primary antibodies resulted in the absence of immunoreactivity. the hcrt1/oxa antiserum has been characterized at light and electron microscope levels and it does not cross-react with hcrt2/oxb antisera  <cit> . what is more, hcrt1/oxa-immunolabeling was never observed in somatodendritic profiles, but only in axons in the vta, as we would have expected, whereas fg is mainly associated with lysosomes and multivesicular bodies of proximal dendrites and somata. fg-immunoprecipitate was also observed in confined zones of the cytoplasm. hcrt1/oxa detection was amplified using immunoperoxidase-nickel-intensification, and the intense electrodense labeling was easily discernible from fg-immunoprecipitate. overall, the immunohistochemical procedures employed allowed the identification of specific labeling in material in which there was almost no background, as judged by stray immunoprecipitate over resin, myelin, or other structures not expected to express the antigens they were raised against.

although hcrt1/oxa-containing axons in our sample only made a few synaptic contacts, we should recall that synaptic specializations occupy a small proportion of the neuron membrane surface and we did not study serial ultrathin sections. thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that hcrt1/oxa-immunolabeled axons might have formed synaptic contacts with fg-labeled neurons in sectional planes other than the ones observed here. moreover, pre-embedding methods can underestimate the associations between immunoreactive profiles  <cit> . in addition, since we injected only a small cortical area , but vta has a widely distributed projection system to cerebral cortex  <cit> , the observed synaptic contacts with fg-dendrites are only a fraction of the total synapses onto mesocortical neurons. however, they represent most of the synaptic contacts with vta neurons that project to mpfc, since our injections in all cases comprised the whole mpfc. moreover, fg has proved to have a good efficiency as a tracer for vta projections to mpfc in numerous studies  <cit> . the high sensitivity of fg as retrograde tracer  <cit>  suggests that most mesocortical neurons reaching the mpfc were detected in our animals. there is no reason to suppose that hcrt1/oxa axons innervate preferentially a neuronal population that had not transported the fg, resulting in an underestimation of contacts.

mesocortical system: the relative contribution of dopaminergic neurons
it is known that many cognitive and attentional processes characteristic of wakefulness are mediated by vta projections to mpfc  <cit> . our fg-labeled neurons were mainly located in the ipsilateral parabrachial division of the vta as reported in similar studies previously done in rats  <cit>  and monkeys  <cit> , even though in some of those studies the injections were more posterior and included all the anterior cingular cortex  <cit> . more recent studies have described that pl injections mainly label neurons within the parabrachial vta of the rat  <cit> , but some others have reported to label equal numbers of paranigral and parabrachial neurons after injections in posterior areas of anterior cingular and prelimbic cortices in mice  <cit> .

our finding of many non-da vta neurons projecting to the mpfc agrees with previous results in rats from swanson   <cit> , carr & sesack  <cit>  and lammel et al.,  <cit> . in addition to da neurons, glutamate and gaba neurons are present in the vta  <cit> , but the distribution of these neuronal populations in the different subdivisions of the vta is heterogeneous. although pbp contains many da neurons  <cit> , the vta pbp neurons projecting to pfc observed in this study and another  <cit>  are mainly non-dopaminergic. moreover, subcellular studies have determined that around 60% of vta neurons projecting to mpfc contain gaba  <cit> . furthermore, lammel et al.,  <cit>  have also described that da neurons projecting to pfc were located mainly in the pn and caudal pbp subdivisions of vta, while neurons in the rostral pbp subdivision that project to mpfc were mostly non-da, as occurred in our animals.

vta actions on the frontal cortex are mediated by both da and non-da neurons. since non-da mediated cortical activity can be blocked with gaba antagonists, these mesocortical neurons are presumed to be mainly gabaergic  <cit> . moreover, electrophysiological unit recordings combined with immunohistochemical detection have demonstrated that many vta mesocortical neurons supposedly involved in reward behaviors and cortical arousal  <cit>  are indeed gabaergic  <cit> . however, we cannot discard that non-da mesoprefrontal neurons could contain some other neurotransmitters such as glutamate, whose presence in vta neurons is unequivocally reported  <cit> . there is also evidence that da vta neurons are unique in their firing rate stability across sleep states  <cit> . on the contrary, vta gaba neurons increase firing rates during active wakefulness and rem sleep in comparison to quiet wakefulness and non-rem sleep  <cit> . this suggests that gaba vta neurons could be more involved in extrathalamic cortical activation  <cit>  while da neurons seem to be implicated in responses to non-predicted rewards or salience  <cit> .

hcrt1/oxa targeting of vta mesocortical neurons
previous studies on preprohcrt/preproox  <cit>  and hcrt1/oxa  <cit>  distributions have reported that hcrt/ox-containing axon density in vta is weaker than in other nuclei such as the locus coeruleus or dorsal raphe nucleus, similarly to our results. balcita-pedicino & sesack  <cit>  observed that hcrt1/oxa and hcrt2/oxb had similar distributions and locations in vta varicose axons. these authors described hcrt/ox-immunoreactivity as being located in the cytoplasm and dense-cored vesicles of different sizes  within axons. furthermore, they reported that only 15% of the hcrt1/oxa-containing axons made some cellular contact  with vta neurons. in our study, the proportion of hcrt1/oxa axons that established contacts is somewhat similar  but, in contrast to their description of both asymmetric and symmetric synapses, we only observed hcrt1/oxa axons making asymmetric synapses on vta dendrites.

hcrt1/oxa has been identified in dcv and ldcv previously  <cit> . these kinds of vesicles release their content by exocytosis  <cit> . torrealba et al.,  <cit>  have reported hcrt1/oxa in ldcv and dcv within axons of the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus. they observed in the same axon terminals that these vesicles were localized far from the synaptic specialization, while translucent small synaptic vesicles near synapses contained glutamate.

hcrt1/oxa and hcrt2/oxb activate both da and non-da vta neurons  <cit> . in contrast to hcrt1/oxa, hcrt2/oxb has been reported to increase presynaptic glutamate release in addition to potentiation of postsynaptic nmda receptors  <cit> . furthermore, hcrt/ox enable glutamate-mediated responses in vta that are necessary for glutamate-dependent long-term potentiation in vta da neurons  <cit> . thus, hcrt1/oxa and hcrt2/oxb could modulate different behavioral components of vta function.

fg injections in pfc combined with ventricular infusion of hcrt1/oxa has shown that the neurons projecting to the pfc that are activated by hcrt1/oxa are mainly located in caudal and medial portions of vta, and that approximately 50% of them are dopaminergic  <cit> . in addition, local infusion of hcrt1/oxa in vta increases wakefulness and da release in pfc  <cit> .

the common observation of hcrt1/oxa axons close to blood vessels, similar to what has been reported in other brain areas , suggests an association between the hcrt/ox system and vasomotor control. in fact, hcrt/ox-r <dig> activation attenuates neurogenic vasodilation of dural vessels  <cit> . hcrt/ox have also shown vasomotor effects through its activation of nitrergic or gabaergic neurotransmission in the solitary tract  <cit> . neuropeptide y, a well-known peptide involved in microvascular functions  <cit> , is contained in hypothalamic neurons targeted by hcrt/ox axons  <cit> . altogether, this suggests that the hcrt/ox system could be involved in vascular tone regulation also in the vta.

functional considerations
hcrt/ox neurons have their highest firing rate in wakefulness, decrease activity during non-rem sleep, and are relatively silent in rem sleep  <cit> . thus, hcrt/ox help in maintaining wakefulness  <cit>  and mediate sleep-wakefulness transitions  <cit> . hcrt1/oxa actions on the cortex are partly direct and partly due to activation of ascending systems reaching the cerebral cortex  <cit> . however, it is unknown, so far, which of these pathways is more relevant for arousal and wakefulness. our results complement previous studies on hcrt1/oxa innervation of brainstem wakefulness-related areas, , and allow us to establish cellular and subcellular bases by which the hypocretinergic/orexinergic system excites vta neurons that project to pl, activating the cerebral cortex. the vta is not the only gateway for hcrt1/oxa neurons to gain acces to the mpfc. significant hcrt1/oxa targeting has also been described in some other brainstem nuclei projecting to mpfc, such as the locus coeruleus  <cit> , dorsal raphe nucleus  <cit>  and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus  <cit> . conceivably, all these structures contribute to cortical-activating actions of hcrt1/oxa. the particular impact of the vta within those actions seems to be especially prominent provided the strong dopaminergic regulation of both sleep attacks and cataplexy in murine and canine models of narcolepsy  <cit> . the existence of hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactive large dense-cored vesicles, which are quite distant from synaptic specializations in axons making asymmetric synapses, suggests that hcrt1/oxa-containing axons may excite vta neurons through both excitatory synapses and non-synaptic mechanisms, most likely through extracellular diffusion of the peptide, and activation of receptors away from the release site  <cit> . overall, this interpretation might help explain the hypersomnia of narcoleptic patients as the result in part of a reduced tone of hcrt1/oxa arousing actions in the vta  <cit> .

the fg-labeled neurons observed in this study may be dopaminergic, gabaergic  <cit>  or glutamatergic  <cit> . the localization of hcrt1/oxa-immunoprecipitate in axons forming asymmetric synapses and in granular vesicles  that are distant from synaptic specializations, suggests that hcrt1/oxa most likely colocalizes with an excitatory neurotransmitter such as glutamate in the vta , similar to what has been described in the tuberomammillary nucleus  <cit> . thus, hcrt1/oxa could enhance the actions of an excitatory neurotransmitter during longer periods of time by rising excitability of common postsynaptic target neurons and/or temporal/spatial summation of individual actions of hcrt1/oxa and the excitatory transmitter. moreover, hcrt/ox inhibit brain structures involved in non-rem sleep generation, such as the preoptic area  <cit>  and also blocks structures involved in rem sleep such as the ventral part of oral pontine tegmentum  <cit> .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we demonstrate that hcrt/ox hypothalamic neurons may activate the medial prefrontal cortex through vta neurons , contributing to the arousal and wake-enhancing functions typical of this cortical area. hcrt1/oxa-containing axons may excite vta neurons through both excitatory synapses and non-synaptic mechanisms . both mechanisms  probably play important roles in cortical activation, enhancing the stabilization of the wakefulness-sleep states and maintaining arousal.
