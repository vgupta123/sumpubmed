BACKGROUND
skeletogenesis is a critical process in vertebrates during which the skeleton develops in a genetically programmed manner, leading to normal anatomy that provides support and protection for the internal organs. in mammals, this process includes the differentiation and proliferation of different cell types, such as chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts, which determine the size, shape and mineral composition of bone structures. the expression of specific genes deeply underlies these processes of cell proliferation and differentiation, which are also controlled by biotic and abiotic factors as well as individual genetic characteristics. thus, determining factors and conditions that control and perturb those processes at the transcriptional level could be useful for deciphering the specific mechanisms behind these processes.

teleost fish are considered to be the first vertebrate group to develop a bony skeleton, and with it, the molecular machinery necessary for its formation and maintenance. thus, fish have been recognized as a suitable vertebrate model for understanding skeletogenesis in lower and higher vertebrates for both comparative  <cit>  and evolutionary  <cit>  purposes. in addition, marine fish larvae hatch much earlier in their development than other vertebrates, suggesting that the spatiotemporal sequences of the skeletal development in teleosts are quite different from those of higher vertebrates  <cit> . this makes marine fish species a very interesting model to study the influence of several nutrients, such as vitamin a, in morphogenesis and skeletogenesis during early larval development  <cit> .

nutritional research has recently focused on the role of nutrients on gene expression and regulation   <cit> . the main pathway by which some nutrients control gene expression is by the activation of transcription factors, with the nuclear receptor superfamily being one of the most important. within this family, the retinoic acid receptors  and retinoid x receptors  are the specific receptors that transduce the vitamin a  signalling by binding to their specific ligands, the retinoic acid isomers. rars and rxrs have been found in all vertebrate tissues examined, and within both are present three different isotypes , each one encoded by a separate gene. these rars and rxrs bind to retinoic acid , becoming ligand-activated receptors. then, they form homo- and/or heterodimers that bind to specific nucleotide sequences  in the promoter region of a large number of genes  <cit> , regulating their transcriptional activity. these rars and rxrs can also affect indirectly the transcription of many other genes without any rare in their promoter  <cit> . then, through those molecular pathways, ra plays a key role in morphogenesis, cellular proliferation and differentiation processes of bone formation  <cit> .

skeletogenesis has been extensively described in several marine fish species  <cit> , but gene expression patterns during larval development have only been partially characterized in european sea bass  and gilthead sea bream . in addition, studies have shown that fish fed diets with deficient or excess va content had compromised development, showing reduced growth and survival rate, delayed digestive system maturation and high incidence of skeletal deformities  <cit> . however, while most reports are related to the consequences of dietary va imbalance, limited work has focused on the molecular pathways involved in retinoid homeostasis that leads to an abnormal fish phenotype  <cit> . moreover, such works have focused mainly on embryonic development rather than larval development  <cit> . therefore, following our previous work on the description of abnormal phenotypes in gilthead sea bream larvae fed with hypervitaminosis a  <cit> , in the present study we evaluated the relative expression of several genes involved in gilthead sea bream morpho- and skeletogenesis during larval development, and their disruption when fish were fed with high va doses. in addition to retinoic acid receptors , we evaluated the expression of different genes interacting with the ra signalling pathway, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  that act as regulators of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, glucose homeostasis, cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as apoptosis in mammals  <cit> ; the gene encoding retinol-binding protein  as the main protein that specifically transports retinol from liver to peripheral tissues  <cit> ; and insulin-like growth factors i and ii , which control cell growth and proliferation. bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  and transforming growth factor β- <dig>  were also studied as they are key transcriptional factors for normal development  <cit> , controlling the production of different extracellular matrix  proteins of bone. additionally, relative expression of genes encoding different ecm proteins was evaluated such as matrix gla protein  and osteocalcin  as important regulators of calcium metabolism and skeletal development; osteopontin  and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine , as examples of important matricellular proteins acting as modulators of ecm interactions; and type i collagen α <dig> chain , which represents 90% of collagen proteins in bone tissues. present results, describing the expression of several genes involved in gilthead sea bream morpho- and skeletogenesis processes under standard larval rearing conditions and their disruption of expression under hypervitaminosis a regimens, are of basic interest for understanding normal skeletogenesis and the appearance of skeletal deformities, as well as a tool for assessing fish nutritional va imbalance.

RESULTS
gilthead sea bream larval growth and bone mineralization
larval growth in standard length  and dry weight  under standard rearing conditions are presented in figure  <dig>  growth in dw and sl shows the typical exponential and linear increase with age, respectively. growth performance of larval rearing under hypervitaminosis a conditions was affected by the level of dietary va  <cit> . whereas no clear effects were found in larval sl at  <dig> days post hatch , larvae fed with the highest dietary va content  were significantly smaller  than the control group at  <dig> dph. similarly, no differences in dw were found between experimental groups at  <dig> dph, while at  <dig> dph 10×va larvae  presented a reduction of 27% in dw with respect to control and  <dig> ×va  larvae .

regarding the bone mineralization of larvae, bone and cartilage staining quantification performed by imaq vision builder is summarized in figure  <dig>  mineralization values were expressed as the ratio of red/blue colour as well as the specific amounts of each colour per larval surface, from stained fish for each experimental group. there were three patterns observed :  in control larvae most of the structures were red coloured with the exception of few structures ;  the  <dig> ×va larvae had many structures quite blue in colouration ; and  in the 10×va larvae blue colouration was intermediate with respect to the previously enumerated structures of  <dig> ×va larvae . mineralization values in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae at  <dig> dph were higher than in the control group, although there were no significant differences . the absence of a statistically significant difference between treatments is likely due to the high variability observed among replicates from each treatment. interestingly, significantly higher cartilage staining was found in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae with respect to the control group . in addition, the ratio of red/blue coloration  showed that both larvae fed with va supplemented diets  had lower values than the control group; although this tendency was not statistically significant .

gene expression patterns during gilthead sea bream ontogeny development under standard rearing conditions
during larval development, ra nuclear receptors, rara, rarg and rxrb, exhibited different expression patterns in gilthead sea bream . under our rearing conditions, gilthead sea bream larvae showed a high overall level of rara gene expression until  <dig> dph, after which levels decreased significantly and thereafter remained constant until the end of the experiment  . conversely, the expression of rarg and rxrb were lower during the initial larval development, after which the levels increased. however, while rarg increased significantly from  <dig> dph, with a peak at  <dig> dph , its expression level significantly decreased at  <dig> dph  with respect to the levels at  <dig> dph. the expression of rxrb increased significantly only between  <dig> and  <dig> dph .

there were no significant differences in the rbp gene expression profile during the larval development . ppara expression was constant from  <dig> to  <dig> dph, whereas at  <dig> dph a peak of gene expression was noted . pparb expression remained constant from  <dig> to  <dig> dph . the pparg expression level did not change from  <dig> to  <dig> dph; however, at the end of the study , expression values were significantly higher than those mostly observed between  <dig> and  <dig> dph , but not significantly different to those observed at  <dig> dph.

overall, the igf <dig> and igf <dig> gene expression had significantly increased at the end of larval development. however, while igf <dig> gene expression increased significantly and progressively from  <dig>  at  <dig> dph to  <dig>  at  <dig> dph , igf <dig> expression remained constant from  <dig> to  <dig> dph . expression values of igf <dig> increased significantly between  <dig> and  <dig>  and remained constant until the end of the study. bmp <dig> did not show significant variations in its mean gene expression ratio throughout larval development , although a tendency for higher expression values was observed from  <dig> dph onwards . interestingly, tgfb <dig> presented an overall significant increase in its gene expression ratio from  <dig> dph until the end of the trial .

with respect to the expression patterns of genes encoding ecm proteins during larval development, all of them increased at the end of the study. however, the mean gene expression ratios reached at the end of the experiment by each gene were different. the genes mgp and bglap showed the highest mean expression ratios at  <dig> dph . in both gla protein genes, a significant increase in the mean gene expression ratio was observed near the end of the trial . in contrast, spp <dig> and sparc showed lower mean values  at the end of the experiment  compared with mgp and bglap ratios, although presenting significant increases as well in comparison to results from early larval stages . furthermore, both spp <dig> and sparc showed a significant increase at  <dig> dph in their mean gene expression ratios, earlier than mgp and bglap. finally, col1a <dig> presented a similar gene expression profile to those of other ecm protein genes, with a significant increase in the mean gene expression ratio at  <dig> dph .

global hierarchical clustering was applied on the gene expression ratios during larval development for the  <dig> studied genes . this clustering was used to classify genes on the basis of similarity of their expression profile during larval development sampling times. two gene clusters were found:  genes whose mean gene expression level increased from  <dig> dph, such as igf <dig>  tgfb <dig>  rxrb, igf <dig> and genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins ; and  genes whose mean gene expression ratio decreased progressively from an initial relatively high level of expression .

gene expression in gilthead sea bream larvae fed with increasing levels of dietary va
at  <dig> dph, larvae fed with increasing dietary va levels exhibited disruption in the expression of several studied genes. while some of them showed an up-regulation, others were down-regulated with respect to the control feeding regime. that gene disruption was also noted in some genes even when the dietary va imbalance had finished more than  <dig> days before .

regarding ra nuclear receptors, rara presented at  <dig> dph a significant up-regulation  in 10×va larvae with respect to control fishes ; however no significant up- or down-regulation of rara was found at  <dig> dph regardless of the dietary conditions . in contrast, while no differences in rarg mean gene expression ratio were found at  <dig> dph in larvae fed with increased dietary va content , a slight but significant rarg down-regulation  was found with respect to control larvae at  <dig> dph . interestingly, no change in gene expression was found concerning the gene rxrb at both sample times analyzed .

at  <dig> dph, an inverse correlation between increasing dietary va and rbp gene expression was observed . larvae fed with a moderate increase in dietary va content  showed a significant up-regulation in the rbp gene expression ratio , whereas those animals fed with the highest levels of va in diet  presented a down-regulation with respect to control larvae . however, no significant differences in rbp gene expression ratios were found at  <dig> dph between experimental groups .

expression levels of ppars were also affected by dietary va levels, however each one to a different extent . larvae fed with higher dietary levels of va  presented a significant down-regulation in ppara at both sample times analyzed ; up to  <dig>  fold change in 10×va larvae at  <dig> dph compared with control larvae . in contrast, larvae fed with higher va diets showed a significant up-regulation in pparb gene expression  with respect to control larvae , whereas no differences were observed in larvae from the  <dig> ×va group at  <dig> dph. interestingly, pparg showed a contrary effect to the increase of va dietary content at  <dig> dph. while there was a slight significant up-regulation in  <dig> ×va larvae , 10×va larvae exhibited a significant down-regulation . however, no differences in gene expression ratio were found in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae at  <dig> dph .

at the end of the feeding phase with high dietary va content , bmp <dig> and tgfb <dig> did not present significantly different gene expression ratios in larvae fed with supplemented va diets  compared with those from the control group . this pattern was also observed at  <dig> dph in  <dig> ×va larvae. however, bmp <dig> and tgfb <dig> gene expression levels were significantly reduced with a  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold change  at  <dig> dph in larvae fed with the highest dietary va content  with respect to control larvae . the igf axis showed different responses to dietary va content . igf <dig> gene expression was up-regulated in larvae fed with higher dietary va levels at  <dig> dph  with respect to the control group ; whereas a significant down-regulation at  <dig> dph  in igf <dig> transcription was found with respect to the control group . interestingly, igf <dig> expression was not significantly different among experimental groups at both analyzed sampling times .

genes encoding extracellular matrix  proteins were also differentially affected by dietary va content . the expression of mgp gene from  <dig> ×va larvae at  <dig> dph was significantly up-regulated  compared with the control larvae , while non-significant differences were found in 10×va larvae . conversely, at  <dig> dph mrna levels of mgp in  <dig> ×va larvae was no significantly different with respect to the control group ; whereas 10×va larvae presented a significantly lower gene expression ratio  than the control larvae . furthermore, the gene encoding the other gla protein analyzed  showed significantly higher gene expression levels at  <dig> dph  in groups fed with higher dietary va content than the control . the effect of increasing dietary va level at  <dig> dph was the same in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae. fish from both treatments showed significant up-regulation on bglap expression  with respect to control larvae . in addition, when analyzing the expression of genes encoding matricellular proteins, spp <dig> did not show significant differences in  <dig> ×va larvae with respect to control larvae at  <dig> dph. however, a significantly higher gene expression ratio  was found in 10×va larvae compared to the control group . furthermore, spp <dig> was down-regulated at  <dig> dph in both larvae fed with higher va dietary content  with respect to the control group . interestingly, sparc only showed significant differences in expression in 10×va larvae at  <dig> dph with respect to the control group , being lower by a  <dig>  fold change. finally, mrna levels of col1a <dig> were not affected by the dietary level of va when compared to the experimental groups  at  <dig> dph. however, at  <dig> dph gene expression of col1a <dig> was significantly lower in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae  as compared to the control group .

discussion
the present study analysed the expression profile of several gene markers for skeletogenesis during the larval development in gilthead sea bream, and the influence of dietary hypervitaminosis a on their expression. reliable nutritional, physiological and gene expression results can be drawn from this work, as results in growth  fell within the range of previously reported values  <cit> . results from this study supported the idea that dietary va content controlled normal fish development through binding of its active metabolite, retinoic acid , with specific nuclear receptors rars and rxrs, and regulated target genes expression levels including retinoic receptors themselves. however, as rna extractions were obtained from pooled whole larvae, the expression profiles of each gene reflect the expression level from a mix of different cell types and tissues. thus, the variation of gene expression ratios observed during larval development under standard conditions could reflect changes in proportions of different tissues throughout ontogenesis and/or gene expression regulation in a specific tissue. in this sense, two different types of gene expression profiles during gilthead sea bream larval development were found by hierarchical clustering, showing that transcription is time- and tissue-dependent for each gene. for example, it is evident that higher expression of genes encoding ecm proteins are correlated with body growth, as increased fish size requires increasing bone strength and skeleton size in order to support the increased body weight. as ecm genes are expressed only in specific tissues , the disruption of their tissue and developmental stage dependent expression by va could be inferred; whereas it would remain unclear for the other genes that are ubiquitously expressed , since their disruption would be masked by the overall expression in other tissues.

retinoid receptors
the different expression profiles of rara, rarg and rxrb found in this study supported the hypothesis that each gene had a temporal and spatial specific expression; suggesting specific roles for each of them  <cit> ; in which contrasted with the suggested redundancy among them as found in mouse null mutant studies  <cit> . previous works pointed out that rara plays a crucial role in vertebrate ra signalling, being ubiquitously expressed in embryonic and adult mammal  <cit>  and fish tissues  <cit> . however, the reported evolution of rara gene expression in this study is not in agreement with that found by villeneuve and co-workers  <cit> , where european sea bass rara gene expression increased from  <dig> to  <dig> dph. it is possible that although both fish species are evolutionarily closely related, their timing of development is quite different, which may explain the above-mentioned differences. interestingly, the fact that rara is predominantly expressed at  <dig> dph in the jaws of european sea bass  <cit> , supports the idea that high expression of rara observed in 10×va larvae may be specifically implicated in the development of jaw deformities detailed in our previous work  <cit> . two factors would explain the high rara gene expression found in 10×va larvae compared to  <dig> ×va and control larvae:  the transcriptional activation of rara through the presence of a rare in its promoter  <cit> , is due to an increase in ra levels; and  the increased gene expression of cyp <dig> enzymes mediated through rarα receptor, in order to degrade the excessive ra into other metabolites  <cit> . under normal conditions, chondrogenesis is accompanied by a decrease in rara expression  <cit> , a process that normally takes place at  <dig> dph in gilthead sea bream. this result supports the idea that the overexpression of rara was dietary induced by an increase of va, as reported in fish exposed to am <dig> , ra  <cit>  or hypervitaminosis a  <cit> . in addition, high transcription levels of rara might be directly responsible for the disruption of normal patterns of skeletogenesis, and could be responsible for the high incidence of skeletal deformities found in fish fed with high levels of va  <cit> . the rara disruption might have also activated a downstream gene cascade, including hoxd- <dig> and shh  <cit>  that would also have affected larval morphogenesis  <cit> , and delaying the maturation of the digestive system as it was found at  <dig> dph larvae from the 10×va group  <cit> . furthermore, such differences in the development of the digestive system were not observed at  <dig> dph  <cit> , when va imbalance was corrected and rara expression was normalized in relation to the control group.

the expression pattern of rarg during larval development suggests that this gene plays a crucial role in the transcriptional ra signal regulation during vertebrate morphogenesis, chondrogenesis and differentiation of squamous epithelia  <cit> . our results show that the rarg gene expression ratio was highest between  <dig> and  <dig> dph, which is concomitant with the onset of the typical adult skin development in gilthead sea bream; and in concordance with that reported in european sea bass between 10- <dig> dph  <cit> . the modulation of rarg expression by hypervitaminosis a has been demonstrated in mammals  <cit>  and fishes  <cit> . nevertheless, no regulation of rarg expression by hypervitaminosis a was detected in gilthead sea bream larvae at  <dig> dph. this might be due to the fact that chondrogenesis in chondral bones is almost completed at that stage of development  <cit> , and rarg is expressed at a lower level in hypertrophic than in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes  <cit> . in contrast to  <dig> dph, larvae aged  <dig> dph exhibited a down-regulation of rarg in  <dig> ×va and 10×va groups, which under present experimental conditions seemed to be linked to different rates of larval development  among dietary treatments.

the role of rxrs on retinoid signal transduction during development of vertebrates depends on each subtype. despite null rxrb or rxrg mutant mice being viable, and do not display va associated abnormalities, rxra null mutants die  <cit> . in teleosts, rxrα is involved in the development of the anterior hindbrain, tailbud, neural crest, pharynx and fins; whereas rxrβ played different roles in early larval development; and rxrγ plays a key role in brain and nervous system development and function  <cit> . in the present study, the ontogenic increase in expression of rxrb during the standard experimental trial was in agreement with previously reported results  <cit> , and it is related to the development of those tissues where rxrb is mainly expressed  <cit> . the expression levels of rxrb in gilthead sea bream larvae were not affected by high levels of dietary va, which seems to confirm that all-trans-ra  does not bind to this nuclear receptor nor is it transcriptionally activated by rares  <cit> .

in this study, we present data from gene expression at specific time points, which is a static representation of a dynamic process involving the formation of homo- and heterodimers of the translated proteins leading to downstream cascades of gene expression. variations in rar-rxr homo-/heterodimer equilibrium have been shown to cause severe abnormalities in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . thus, abnormal skeletogenesis and/or morphogenesis in gilthead sea bream could be interpreted as a perturbation of the nuclear rar-rxr homo-/heterodimer equilibrium, as higher amount of rara transcripts could induce increased formation of rarα-rxr heterodimers or decreased formation of rxr heterodimers with its different partners .

retinol-binding protein
retinol binding protein  is reputed for transporting retinol from the liver to different target tissues  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies in fish  <cit>  and other vertebrates  <cit> , rbp gene expression was low during larval development, and remained constant until metamorphosis. such low rbp expression might be due to either low retinol mobilization requirements during early fish larval development, or to the fact that the daily requirements for va were already fulfilled. therefore, retinol mobilization from liver to target tissues was not needed, and consequently the rbp not transcribed. when gilthead sea bream larvae were fed with moderately increased levels of va  at  <dig> dph, rbp expression was up-regulated, whereas this gene was down-regulated in fish fed with the highest levels of va . those changes in rbp gene expression by the dietary va levels may be due to transcriptional regulation through the double rare in its promoter. considering that va homeostasis via its release from storage tissues is a tightly controlled process  <cit> , we suggest that the observed rbp gene expression in gilthead sea bream larvae in response to dietary va content is part of a protective mechanism to avoid va toxicity. under slight dietary hypervitaminosis a  conditions, an increase in rbp mrna level could be directly induced by binding of ligand activated rars and rxrs to its rare  <cit> ; whereas during exposure to elevated va levels , a decrease in rbp expression might take place to reduce the mobilization of va from the adipose tissue and liver  <cit> .

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  are well known fatty acid and eicosanoid inducible nuclear receptors in vertebrates, playing multiple physiological functions  <cit> . molecular studies recently showed that there exist differences in tissue expression and ligand-binding properties between fish and mammalian ppars  <cit> .

considering that pparα is implicated in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism  <cit> , the progressive increase in ppara expression at late larval stages seemed to be correlated to larval growth and progressive differentiation of the liver, intestine and muscle, where this receptor is mainly expressed  <cit> . however, ppara expression was down-regulated when larvae were exposed to high levels of dietary va at  <dig> dph, which might be linked to the impaired maturation of the digestive system of  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae in comparison to the control group  <cit> . this is in agreement with  <cit> , ppara expression being dependant on the nutritional status of the animal and its changing energy requirements during development. as pparα plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation in fishes  <cit> , its down-regulation in gilthead sea bream early juveniles fed with hypervitaminosis a might have also perturbed the normal differentiation rate of mesenchymal cells into myogenic, osteogenic and/or adipocytic cells, leading to skeletal deformities.

pparβ in mammals is involved in the skeletal, brain and skin functions as well as in adipose tissue differentiation and fatty acid metabolism  <cit> . its early expression in gilthead sea bream might be linked to the mobilization of endogenous reserves stored in the yolk sac  <cit>  and to the synthesis and turnover of cellular membranes  <cit> . however, it did not correlate significantly with growth or fat deposition, as it has been previously reported in cobia   <cit> . increased expression of pparb has been described in the early phase of adipogenesis in mammals  <cit>  and red sea bream   <cit> ; but in contrast to mammalian pparb, its expression in adipocytes did not seem to be under nutritional control. primary osteoblastic cells showed a high expression of pparb  <cit> , then the higher gene expression of pparb in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae compared to the control group at  <dig> dph might indicate a premature osteoblastogenesis in those groups, as has been suggested in our previous study  <cit> . interestingly, it has been reported that muscle-specific overexpression of pparb in mice resulted in a profound change in muscle fibre composition due to hyperplasia  <cit> . impaired muscle development could in turn induce some vertebral deformities  <cit>  and lead to those skeletal deformities  reported in our previous study  <cit> . these changes in muscle were coupled with a reduction in the mass of body fat of mice  <cit>  that may be in agreement with the gene expression of the above-mentioned ppara and pparg. in addition, pparb was up-regulated in 10×va larvae at  <dig> dph, which could reflect a retarded adipogenesis. it is clear that more research is needed to reveal the role of pparβ in regulating the muscle fibre growth and the adiposity of marine fish, as well as the potential induction of skeletal deformities by such impaired muscle development.

in mammalians, pparγ regulates adipogenesis at its early phase through heterodimerization with rxr  <cit> . in fish, it seems that pparγ fulfil the same roles, although they are not activated by the same specific ligands  <cit> . under normal rearing conditions, pparg expression increased with gilthead sea bream ontogenesis similarly to data reported in cobia where pparg expression increased with fish growth and fat deposition  <cit> . however, it has been reported that retinaldehyde  inhibits pparg, resulting in a lower ppar-rxr complex formation  <cit> , which in turn could enhance osteogenesis instead of adipogenesis in mesenchymal cells. thus, lower pparg expression in fish fed with high levels of va  at  <dig> dph could reflect an enhancement of osteogenesis and disrupt normal skeletogenesis in gilthead sea bream larvae. this hypothesis is also reinforced by the increased blue coloured surfaces  in both  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae compared with control larvae.

growth factors
skeletal cells synthesize different growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, igfs, tgfβ, and additional cytokines. the expression of igf <dig> is found in different soft and calcified tissues in adult gilthead sea bream  <cit> , where three spliced variants with a specific pattern of expression have been found  <cit> . our taqman assay was designed to recognise all three igf <dig> splice variants; therefore, our reported gene expression ratio for igf <dig> is the sum of the expression for all three splice variants. in the present study, the progressive increase of igf <dig> expression was in accordance with the high cell proliferation rate, and/or the increase in specific cell activity in different tissues during larval morphogenesis  <cit> . the dose-dependent overexpression of igf <dig> found at  <dig> dph in gilthead sea bream larvae fed hypervitaminosis a, was in agreement with previous works  <cit> . the higher igf <dig> expression in the 10×va group might be due to synergistic direct and indirect effects. the growth hormone promoter contains a rare  <cit> , and has been found to be regulated by rarα/γ isoforms in pituitary cells of carp . in turn, increased rara expression might induce growth hormone transcription and secretion, which finally would induce an increase in igf <dig> hepatic transcripts. in addition, increased levels of thyroxin  were observed in fish under hypervitaminosis a  <cit> , while t <dig> is reported to induces igf <dig> expression in in vitro fish studies  <cit> . then, it seems plausible that the increase in expression of igf <dig> in gilthead sea bream larvae fed with high va levels  could be due also to increased t <dig> levels. such high igf <dig> expression, which is known to promote muscle differentiation and growth  <cit> , coupled with that of pparb, might have caused an imbalance in the development of the musculoskeletal system in gilthead sea bream fed with high levels of va, leading to a higher incidence of lordosis in those larvae  <cit> .

in the present study, the abrupt increase in igf <dig> expression recorded at the end of the larval phase  corresponds with the onset of ossification in most of the bone structures  <cit> , which is mainly due to its role in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . in contrast to igf <dig>  the expression of igf <dig> in gilthead sea bream fed with hypervitaminosis a was not disrupted, supporting the idea that different hormonal signals and mechanisms of gene transcription control the regulation of expression of both igf forms  <cit> .

other growth factors such as transforming growth factors beta  or the bone morphogenetic proteins  are important for the development of bone, among other tissues  <cit> . among those bmp's, bmp- <dig> plays a key role in bone development, inducing the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblast precursors and promoting the maturation of osteoblasts through the expression of runx2/cbfa <dig>  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> is involved in the regulation of a broad range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration, production of extracellular matrix  <cit> , as well as maintaining bone homeostasis and turnover  <cit> . in our study, the gene expression profile of bmp <dig> in larvae reared under standard conditions seemed to correlate with the biological function of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> expression between  <dig> and  <dig> dph might be associated with the onset of pre-osteoblasts proliferation  <cit> ; whereas the observed tendency of bmp <dig> to increase between  <dig> and  <dig> dph might be due to its role as a promoter of osteoblast differentiation. furthermore, increased expression of tgfb <dig> was concomitant with an increase in expression of several genes encoding ecm proteins, as has been reported  <cit> .

bmp <dig> expression in early larval stages  fed with hypervitaminosis a was not affected. however, the possibility cannot be neglected that in those larvae ra might have disrupted bmp <dig> expression prior to our sampling point, as has been shown in vitro studies  <cit> . in contrast, bmp <dig> was down-regulated in 10×va larvae at  <dig> dph, suggesting a negatively controlled regulation of bmp <dig>  <cit> . this down-regulation of bmp <dig> concomitant with lower rarg gene expression is in accordance with the reported loss of the ra-inducible expression of bmp <dig> in the absence of rarg gene expression  <cit> . in addition, the bmp <dig> down-regulation might down-regulate the expression of ecm encoding genes  observed in 10×va larvae through the transcriptional regulation of runx2/cbfa <dig>  <cit> .

bmp- <dig> and tgfβ <dig> have opposing actions on osteoblast function and differentiation. while bmp- <dig> enhances runx2/cbfa <dig> expression, tgfβ <dig> inhibits its expression; then, both genes regulate the coordinated expression of several genes encoding ecm proteins  <cit> . the fact that both genes  were down-regulated in gilthead sea bream larvae fed with hypervitaminosis a  at  <dig> dph, could be explained by the ubiquitous expression of tgfb <dig> which had a variety of other biological functions and therefore, this down-regulation of tgfb <dig> may not be representative of the skeletal tissue alone.

genes encoding bone extracellular matrix proteins
until the beginning of the ossification process at  <dig> dph  showed low gene expression values. these results were in accordance with the ongoing development of most skeletal structures, that were not yet ossified, with the exception of some located in the viscerocranial and caudal region  <cit> . higher gene expression was found from  <dig> dph onwards, concomitantly with the intense ossification of most of the bone structures, such as vertebrae centra . the expression of ecm proteins progressively increased during larval ontogeny. however, the significant increases of each gene occurred at different developmental times, the first to increase being sparc and spp <dig>  followed by mgp, and finally by that of col1a <dig> and bglap, which shows the progression of gene transcription of specific bone matrix development markers.

the early increase in expression of sparc during gilthead sea bream ontogenesis reflects the many key processes during early larval development in which that protein is involved, showing an enhanced expression in areas undergoing chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, somitogenesis and angiogenesis  <cit> . sparc is also reputed for inhibiting adipogenesis and enhancing osteoblastogenesis and fibrogenesis in rainbow trout  <cit> , as well as for participating in the final mineralization and remodelling of the ecm. our increase in sparc expression during gilthead sea bream larval development is in agreement with that reported in rainbow trout   <cit> , but was contrary to the results found in gilthead sea bream  <cit> . although results are methodologically incompatible with those of  <cit>  for comparative purposes, the increase in expression of sparc during early larval ontogeny would seem more plausible, considering the participation of sparc in many biological processes. regarding spp <dig>  its early increased expression might be attributed to the differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts  <cit> .

in mammals, mgp is a decisive factor for differentiation and maturation of chondrocytes and a key regulator of chondral and intramembranous ossification  <cit> . in fish, branchial arches are the sites with higher levels of mgp expression, followed by the heart, vertebra, kidney and liver  <cit> . thus, increased gene expression during larval ontogeny in our experiment could reflect the development of the above-mentioned organs and vital systems in order to match the biological needs of the developing larva.

col1a <dig> is mainly expressed in connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea, and dermis, and in two cell types, osteoblasts and fibroblasts. collagen fibres comprise 90% of the ecm proteins in skeletal tissues and confer most of their physical properties  <cit> . the present ontogeny of the col1a <dig> expression was in agreement with previous results found in european sea bass, where col1a <dig> was highly expressed from  <dig> dph onwards  <cit> . according to this data, the earlier increase in col1a <dig> expression in comparison to that of bglap is in agreement with the temporal coordination of both ecm encoding genes  <cit> . osteocalcin is a specific bone marker  <cit>  that is required for the correct maturation of hydroxyapatite crystals during the process of calcification  <cit> . however, the relationship between osteocalcin and mineralization remains unclear even within the same species, since some authors detected bglap prior to mineralization and others at the onset or after the beginning of mineralization  <cit> . its early detection at  <dig> dph, in contrast to the previous reported detection in gilthead sea bream at  <dig> dph  <cit> , might be linked to the different molecular techniques used, since qpcr is more sensitive than northern blot analysis. this earlier detection, prior to the development of mature osteoblasts and calcification processes, might be linked to its expression in chondrocytes undergoing chondral calcification, as reported in zebrafish  <cit> . however, the increase in bglap expression at older stages of development  seemed to be due to the completion of the ossification of skeletal structures in the axial skeleton  <cit> , similar to that found in european sea bass  <cit> . considering that osteopontin and osteocalcin are involved in the modulation of hydroxyapatite crystallization  <cit> , the advanced spp <dig> expression might be related to the inhibition of osteoblast mineralization  <cit>  occurring in vertebrae centra during their intramembranous ossification, thus allowing osteoblast to maintain their proliferative state; while bglap expression would be an indicator of the osteoblast mineralization in those structures  <cit> .

the colour pixel analysis of skeletal structures revealed that bone development was affected by hypervitaminosis a, showing a disequilibrium between bone and cartilage, as  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae display higher amounts of cartilage and lower values of red/blue coloration ratio with respect to the control group, respectively. those lower ratios are in agreement with higher growth of some cartilage elements leading to the fusion of caudal fin complex structures  <cit> . those differences in bone mineralization levels and ossification processes were reflected by changes in gene transcription, describing two different scenarios of mineralization stage for particular skeletal elements  depending on the dietary va level. through its active metabolite ra, va promotes terminal differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes  <cit> , which could explain the higher amount of cartilage tissue in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae. furthermore, mgp over-expression in  <dig> ×va larvae at  <dig> dph indicated an abnormal development of cartilage, as mgp has been reported to control bone mineralization  <cit> . in contrast, high levels of va in 10×va larvae induced advancement of the mineralization process of chondral structures leading to a higher mineralization stage  <cit> . such advanced mineralization could be explained by the down-regulation of mgp in 10×va larvae at  <dig> dph and the higher expression of spp <dig> at  <dig> dph compared to control and  <dig> ×va larvae, as osteopontin is involved in osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . these results are in agreement with those reported in cell culture studies  <cit>  and in vivo experiments  <cit> . at the end of the study, the down-regulation of spp <dig> in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae might be considered as another sign of an abnormal osteoblast development, since spp <dig> likely plays a key role in determining the biochemical properties of the bone  <cit> . in addition, another sign of the advancement of the mineralization process in skeletal structures in 10×va larvae was the down-regulation of sparc at  <dig> dph.

regarding bglap transcriptional regulation, it was up-regulated at  <dig> dph in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larval groups, reflecting an earlier chondral ossification of some skeletal elements derived from the splanchnocranium  which are the unique skeletal structures that were ossifying during that stage of development  <cit> . this precocious ossification process could be responsible for the high incidence of deformities in the above-mentioned structures described in our previous study  <cit> . furthermore, at the end of the study , fish fed with higher levels of va  showed a higher bglap expression than those from the control group. the over-expression of bglap in the fish fed hypervitaminosis a indicated an increased ongoing osteogenic processes, as those larvae presented a higher amount of osteogenic tissue  compared to the control group. consequently, present results suggest that if normal ranges for bglap expression are established, this gene might be a reliable marker for detecting disorders in bone formation and mineralization processes  <cit> .

finally, results of col1a <dig> expression were not as informative as the other analyzed genes from the ecm regarding the skeletogenesis process. no changes in gene expression were found in col1a <dig> in larvae fed with hypervitaminosis a at  <dig> dph compared to the control group, even though it has been shown that this gene contains a rare in its promoter  <cit> . different results from the effects of ra on the expression of col1a <dig> are reported in the literature  <cit> , which suggests an indirect regulation of col1a <dig> by ra. however, larvae from the  <dig> ×va and 10×va groups showed lower expression of col1a <dig> at  <dig> dph, which seems to be attributed to the lower expression of rarg detected in those animals, since this rar binds specifically to the rare of the col1a <dig> promoter  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study showed that the analysed gene expression patterns in the gilthead sea bream were correlated with skeletogenesis during early larval development, as they showed a temporally coordinated gene expression for specific markers of the ecm. furthermore, results from this study supported the idea that perturbations in specific dietary nutrients can alter normal anatomic development mediated by specific genes controlled by ligand-receptor interactions. although both experimental groups  were fed with an excess of va, there were differences in their juvenile phenotype depending on the degree of hypervitaminosis a.  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae were fed respectively with moderate and high dietary va content . from this we conclude, only hypervitaminosis a in the 10×va group impaired larval performance in terms of growth, maturation of the digestive system and survival rate, in which the down-regulation of rbp is illustrative of excessive dietary va. however, both doses of va differentially affected the coordinated expression of genes during skeletogenesis, some of them being markers for the differences in the processes of chondrogenesis and osteoblastogenesis observed among dietary groups at early stages of larval development . in particular, the up-regulation of bglap in  <dig> ×va and 10×va larvae indicated an advanced ossification in some skeletal structures. early disturbance of skeletogenesis were still manifest after  <dig> days, as revealed by differences in gene expression, highlighting the importance of a good nutritional balance during larval development that determines juvenile phenotype.

concluding, present results showed that fish are reliable animal models to study the effects of nutritional hypervitaminosis a. however, since only global effects of dietary va on fish larval physiology could be inferred from this study due to the use of whole organisms, in vitro research with bone cell lines is needed to understand the mechanisms by which ra controls skeletogenesis.
