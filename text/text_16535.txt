BACKGROUND
the global energy demand will increase drastically in the near future due the population and economic growth; calculations indicate at least a 2-fold increase over  <dig> years  <cit> . to be able to meet the global energy demand new and sustainable non-coal based or carbon-neutral energy resources have to be developed. molecular hydrogen, h <dig>  is one of the upcoming promising alternative energy carriers  <cit> . cyanobacteria are together with green algae possible candidates for future clean and sustainable energy production of hydrogen, since they are the only organisms capable of the unique combination of having oxygenic photosynthesis and hydrogenases, allowing them to use and convert solar energy and water into hydrogen   <cit> .

the enzymes directly involved in hydrogen metabolism in cyanobacteria are hydrogenases and nitrogenases. depending on the cyanobacterial strain, a single cell can harbour either an uptake hydrogenase or a bidirectional enzyme or both. n2-fixing strains contain at least an uptake hydrogenase which recycles the energy rich hydrogen molecule is produced as a by-product of the nitrogenase under n2-fixation. hydrogenases, as well as nitrogenases, are very sensitive to oxygen which inactivates the activity of the proteins. to protect these enzymes they are physically located in the special cell type called heterocyst  <cit> , or function under anaerobic conditions only  <cit> .

the cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenase consists of at least two functional subunits, encoded by the structural genes hupl and hups. hupl harbours the active site and hups harboururs iron-sulphur  slusters which transfer electrons from the active site  <cit> .

all cyanobacterial hydrogenases are classified as nife-hydrogenases, being either uptake hydrogenases  or bidirectional hydrogenases ,  <cit> . the active site has a complex structure with one ni and one fe atom, to which biochemically unusual ligands of cn and co are bound. in order to develop a fully active and mature hydrogenase at least seven specific proteins are required. of the seven, the six hyp proteins encoded by hypabcdef  are responsible for the insertion of the metal atoms into the acitve site of the hydrogenases, as well as the attachement of the ligands to the fe atom  <cit> . the function of the hyp-genes have been mainly studied in e. coli. the high homology to the cyanobacterial hyp-genes indicates that the role is the same in cyanobacteria. indeed, analyses of deletion and insertion mutants of hyp genes in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> showed no hydrogenase activity  <cit> . the hyp-genes are conserved and can either be found together, e.g. in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> and anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> or spread out in the genome as in synechosystis sp. strain pcc  <dig>  there is only one set of hyp-genes independent of the number of hydrogenases in the cells  <cit> . this indicates a co-regulation of the hyp-genes on the assembly of both types of hydrogenases  <cit> . how this is achieved is not known, but the hyp-genes should be regulated differently depending on e.g. strains, environment and type of hydrogenase. the seventh factor is encoded either by hupw or hoxw, hydrogenase specific proteases which are needed to cleave off part of the c-terminal of the large subunit  <cit> . this is only done after the insertion of ni in the active site and may function as a checkpoint for the maturation process  <cit> . the cleavage enables a conformal change of the large subunit, which is necessary for the binding of the small subunit, hups.

the small subunit of hydrogenases harbours  clusters which are the main components in electron transport to and from the active site and they define the electron transport pathways in both membrane-bound and soluble redox-enzymes  <cit> . how the assembly and maturation process is achieved is not well known, but three different types of  cluster assembly have been presented with two requirements in common: the need for a  scaffolding protein, and a cysteine desulphurase which is required to yield elemental sulphur or hydrogen sulphide  <cit> .

nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> is a n2-fixing filamentous and heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium. the  <dig>  mb genome contains a single nitrogenase, and both an uptake and a bidirectional hydrogenases are present  <cit> .

to improve the yield of h <dig> produced by cyanobacteria and e.g. to establish the foundation for the introduction of foreign hydrogenases into cyanobacteria it is essential to understand the regulation of the genes directly involved in the maturation of cyanobacterial hydrogenase. in the present paper we describe the transcriptional regulation of the hyp-genes and neighbour open reading frames in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  we also discuss the putative function of the upstream genes and the role for the conserved sequences present in some of the intergenic regions of the extended hyp-operon.

RESULTS
transcription of the extended hyp-operon
to determine if the hyp-genes are transcribed as a single operon and to identify putative 5'race transcriptional start points , reverse transcriptase pcr , northern blot, and experiments were performed using total rna isolated from n2-fixing cultures. the six hyp-genes, hypfcdeab, the orf asr <dig> located between hypd and hype, the two downstream orfs and five upstream orfs are all shown to be part of the same operon . to eliminate any false results from contaminating genomic dna a specially designed tag was used in the rt-pcr reactions  <cit>  . to cover the complete  <dig> kb sequence overlapping cdnas of  <dig> kb were synthesized . the four upstream orfs asr <dig>  asr <dig>  alr <dig>  and alr <dig>  encode unknown or hypothetical proteins, and alr <dig> is annotated as a gene encoding a protein similar to nifu. all proteins have conserved domains; asr <dig> and asr <dig> encodes possible abc-transporters with membrane spanning regions, alr <dig> encodes a protein with tpr  and prenyltransferase like domains, alr <dig> encodes a protein containing nifu and thioredoxin domains, and the protein product of alr <dig> harbours nhl  and tpr repeats .

the open reading frame asr <dig>  located between hypd and hype, is annotated as encoding a probable 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase and has an orthologue in anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> with an amino acid sequence identity of  <dig> %. the two orfs asr <dig> and alr <dig>  positioned downstream of the hyp-cluster, are encoding proteins with unknown function and as being a serine proteinase, respectively. asr <dig> has homologues in both nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> and anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> where the encoded proteins share an amino acid sequence identity of 46% with the gene products of alr <dig> and 44% with ava_ <dig> respectively. the encoded proteins of alr <dig> and ava_ <dig> share an amino acid sequence identity of 99%. orthologues of alr <dig> are found in many other cyanobacterial strains, but not always directly downstream of the hyp-operon. the transcript levels of the genes in the extended hyp-operon are low, since northern blot analysis using specific probes within asr <dig>  alr <dig>  hypf or hypab, failed to detect any mrnas .

transcriptional start point  analyses and characterization of the promoter regions
5'race was performed to identify tsps along the extended hyp-operon. based on known tsps in the hyp-gene cluster of nostoc punctiforme pcc  <dig>  <cit>  the upstream regions of four genes, asr <dig>  alr <dig>  hypf and hypc, were examined. three tsps were identified . one tsp was identified  <dig> bp upstream asr <dig>  with a putative σ70-like - <dig> box sequence  and two putative ntca-binding sites, centred around - <dig> bp  and - <dig> bp  with respect to the tsp. the second tsp was found  <dig> bp upstream hypf with a putative, extended - <dig> box   <cit> . a third tsp was identified  <dig> bp upstream hypc together with a putative σ70-like sequence, including both a - <dig> and a - <dig> box,  upstream of the tsp, respectively. no tsp could be identified upstream alr <dig> 

repeats and palindromic hairpins
in blast searches of the complete  <dig> kb extended hyp-operon, ten conserved short  sequences  were identified in six intergenic regions  . each of the conserved sequences is widely distributed  within the genome of nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  in addition, one of the conserved sequences , located in the intergenic region between hypf and hypc, is also present  <dig> times on the alpha plasmid . csr <dig> /csr <dig>  appear twice in the intergenic region of asr0701-alr <dig>  this sequence has previously been identified in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> as a ltrr   <cit> . two of the intergenic regions, hups-asr <dig> and alr0693-hypf, harbour three and two different conserved sequences, respectively. simulations suggest that some of the conserved sequences; csr <dig>  csr <dig> , csr <dig> an csr <dig>  might form palindromic hairpins, with Δg melting energies predicted of - <dig>  to - <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  however, the conserved sequences csr <dig>  csr <dig>  and csr <dig>  have no favourable energies for putative formations of secondary structures.

discussion
transcription of the extended hyp-operon
this study demonstrates that the hyp-genes in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> may be trancribed as a single operon which is in accordance with results from other cyanobacteria  <cit> . furthermore, the five genes localised directly upstream and the two genes downstream of the hyp-operon form transcripts with the hyp-genes . in addition to the tsp positioned upstream of asr <dig>  two tsps were identified upstream of hypf and hypc, respectively , indicating that multiple short transcripts within the operon may exist. the position of the tsp upstream hypf is in agreement with results from lyngbya majuscula ccap 1446/ <dig>  <cit> . in nostoc punctiforme pcc  <dig>  no tsps were detected in the upstream vicinity of either hypf or hypc. instead, a tsp was identified upstream the npr <dig>  an orthologue to alr <dig>  positioned upstream from hypf as in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  with a putative ntca-binding site and a - <dig> box  <cit> . no tsp was identified upstream alr <dig> in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  transcripts of varying sizes derived from the same operon have been reported in cyanobacteria, e.g. within the hox-operons in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  and in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . a putative σ70-like - <dig> box was identified upstream the first gene in the extended hyp-cluster, asr <dig>  together with two putative ntca-binding sites centred around - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp upstream the tsp. the sequence  does not perfectly conform with the consensus sequence  shown to be important for ntca binding, but there are examples where ntca has been shown to bind to imperfect ntca consensus sites. the position of the putative ntca binding site located closer to the tsp than the more common  <dig>  bp could indicate that the binding site would be compatible with ntca acting as a repressor  <cit> . the second putative ntca binding site  centred - <dig> bp upstream the tsp has a perfect match to the consensus sequence . in the case of ntca depending promoters a recognizable - <dig> box is usually missing  <cit> . the activity of ntca will most probably be dependent of various growth parameters, and the presence of other regulating proteins and or metabolites interacting with ntca. the promoter region upstream hypf contains an extended - <dig> box  which belongs to a subclass of e. coli promoters which functions without a - <dig> box  <cit> . in the promoter region upstream hypc both a putative - <dig> and a - <dig> box have been identified. the presence of tsps upstream from both hypf and hypc can be coupled to the specific function of the respective proteins. hypf is involved in the synthesis of the cn-ligands, while hypc and the downstream hyp proteins are active in the insertion of the metal atoms into the active site and in the stabilization of the protein complex  <cit> . the promoter regions of hypf and hypc are both localized within respective upstream genes. this may indicate that they are individually expressed as a result of the need for more detailed regulation of the amount of the proteins translated from their respective mrna.

the gene cluster asr0689-alr <dig>  positioned upstream of the hyp-operon  was shown to be transcribed together with the hyp-genes. these five orfs are present in other filamentous, heterocystous n2-fixing cyanobacteria, e.g. anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  <cit> , nodularia spumigena ccy <dig> , and nostoc punctiforme pcc  <dig>  <cit> . orthologues also exist in the filamentous, non-heterocystous n2-fixing cyanobacteria lyngbya majuscula ccap 1446/ <dig>  and trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig>  <cit>  . these orfs are present in cyanobacterial strains containing an uptake hydrogenase but absent in strains harbouring only a bidirectional hydrogenase. in strains with these orfs, the five identified orfs are located between the hupsl and the hyp-genes, as in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  with the exception of trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> where the hyp-genes are located ~ <dig>  mb away from the structural hup-genes .

a positioned directly upstream hypf with a distance of  <dig>  mb to hupsl.

there is not much known about the two orfs, asr <dig> and asr <dig>  except that they have putative membrane spanning regions and might function as abc-transporters . the protein encoded by alr <dig> contains tpr domains , which have been shown to be involved in functions as chaperone in protein-protein interactions and assembly of multi-protein complexes  <cit> . a relevant feature of the protein encoded by alr <dig> is that it harbors a nifu-like domain partly overlapping a thioredoxin-like domain. nifu-like proteins show a high degree of similarity between species as different as humans and viruses, which suggests that they are much conserved  <cit> . thioredoxins participate in redox reactions catalysing the reduction of intra-molecular disulfide bonds , and can play a role as sulphur donor in the mobilization of sulphur for maturation of  clusters  <cit> . the protein encoded by the fifth orf alr <dig> contains domains with tpr and nhl  repeats. nhl repeats could, according to structural model analysis, be involved in protein-protein interactions . the nhl domain is also associated with zinc finger motifs, which is often found in eukaryotes where they function as dna binding motifs in transcription factors, by stabilizing a protein structure around the zinc atoms  <cit> . in nostoc punctiforme sp. strain pcc  <dig> npr <dig>  the orthologue of alr <dig>  located in exactly the same position as in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  is transcribed together with the hyp-genes with a defined tsp and a promoter region putatively controlled by ntca  <cit> . a suggestion is that this orf might be involved in the maturation process of the large subunit of the uptake hydrogenase together with the hyp-genes. the location is in accordance with the orthologue in trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig>  tery_ <dig>  located directly upstream hypf and the hyp-genes, and has an identical arrangement as for the other orthologues of alr <dig> .

maturation of the small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase
a study of the legume endosymbiont rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae st. upm <dig> demonstrated that a cluster of four genes, hupghij, positioned between the structural genes and the hyp-operon is involved in the maturation of the small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase  <cit> . especially hupg, which has a structural domain related to thioredoxins and thiol-disulfide isomerases, and huph which forms a complex structure with the pre-hups seem to be important. huph is thought to stabilize the protein complex as a chaperone during the maturation process and it has also domains characteristic of rubredoxins  <cit> . when using blast-searches, no orthologues to the gene cluster hupghij were found in the cyanobacterial genomes, but the two orfs alr <dig> and alr <dig> contain conserved sequences encoding similar domains as present in huph and hupg. based on the finding that asr0689-alr <dig> are transcribed together with the hyp-genes in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> , the existence of highly conserved orthologue regions in n2-fixing cyanobacteria positioned between hupsl, and the hyp genes, and that two of the orfs alr <dig> and alr <dig>  contain functional domains resembling huph and hupg it is tempting to suggest that the upstream genes of the hyp-operon in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> are involved in the assembly and maturation process of the cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenase small subunit. to prove if this hypothesis is true mutational studies followed by additional experiments will be done. interestingly, orthologues to the gene cluster asr0689-alr <dig> are absent in cyanobacteria harbouring only the bidirectional hydrogenase.

repeats and palindromic hairpins
in six of the intergenic regions of the extended hyp-operon, a total of ten kinds of conserved sequences were found, appearing between  <dig> and  <dig> times in the genome . the conserved sequences that might form putative perfect palindromic structure  could be involved in protein binding. the conserved sequence r <dig>  occurs twice in the same intergenic region . additionally, the intergenic region between hypf and hypc includes two csr <dig> sequences partly overlapping each other . the conserved sequences are able to form putative hairpin secondary structures  and are positioned between the transcriptional and the translational start point, which might indicate a function in translation. another possibility is that these conserved sequences might have no functions at all and that they are results of evolutionary transposition events. to investigate the possible functions of the conserved sequences in the extended hyp-operon functional genomic experiments such as mutational studies will be performed.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that five orfs encoding proteins with unknown functions are co-transcribed with the hyp-genes, and identified three tsps, in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> . the additional conservation of these genes among n2-fixing cyanobacteria may indicate an important function, hypothetically in the maturation of the small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase.
