BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that causes acute and chronic infections in immunocompromised hosts, including severely burned patients, individuals with cystic fibrosis, transplant recipients and cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy  <cit> . virulence of p. aeruginosa in these severe infections depends on the production of cell-associated and extracellular virulence factors  <cit> . among the extracellular virulence factors produced by p. aeruginosa are the type iii secretion system , which is a needle-like structure that injects cytotoxins from the cytoplasm of p. aeruginosa directly into the cytoplasm of host cells, exotoxin a , the lasb protease , lasa, alkaline protease, and phenazines  <cit> . cell-associated factors are lipopolysaccharide , the alginate capsule, the flagellum, and the pili  <cit> . the production of these factors is controlled by different regulatory proteins, among which is the global regulator vfr   <cit> . vfr, which belongs to the family of cyclic amp  receptor proteins  and has 90% similarity to the escherichia coli crp, was originally described as a p. aeruginosa factor that is required for the production of eta and protease iv  <cit> . further studies have demonstrated that vfr activates the transcription of several other virulence genes, such as genes encoding different components of the type iii secretion system; as well as the quorum sensing  genes lasr and rhlr, and rpos, which encodes the stationary phase sigma factor  <cit> . kanack et al. showed that vfr specifically binds to the upstream regions of its target genes  <cit> .

using microarray analysis, wolfgang et al. identified more than  <dig> genes that are regulated either positively or negatively by vfr, including those that encode components of the type iii secretion system such as exos and exsa <cit> . among the genes whose expression was reduced in the vfr mutant compared with its parent strain were pa <dig> and pa <dig> <cit> . in this study, we report the characterization of the protein encoded by pa <dig>  and a detailed analysis of the regulation of pa <dig> and pa <dig> by vfr.

RESULTS
vfr regulates the transcription of the pa2782-pa <dig> operon
pa <dig> is located immediately upstream of pa <dig> and the two genes are separated by 78 bp. computer analyses using the pseudomonas genome database suggested that the two genes represent an operon   <cit> . to confirm this experimentally, we used reverse transcriptase pcr  and primers corresponding to specific sequences within either pa <dig> alone or within both genes to detect transcripts from pao <dig> grown to od <dig>  <dig>  . we detected a 550-bp transcript that overlaps the two genes . as a control, we detected a 195-bp transcript produced by two primers corresponding to specific sequences within pa <dig> . as a negative control, the rna sample was subjected to pcr without reverse transcriptase . as a positive control, we used pao <dig> genomic dna as a template for the 550-bp product .

a previous microarray analysis revealed that vfr regulates the expression of the p. aeruginosa genes pa <dig> and pa <dig> <cit> . pa <dig> expression was significantly reduced in the vfr deletion mutant pak∆vfr compared with its parent strain pak  <cit> . while pak has been extensively studied in lung and corneal infections  <cit> , its effects in wound infections, a major emphasis in our laboratory, is less characterized. p. aeruginosa strain pao <dig> is highly virulent in wound infections, including burn wounds, and has been well-studied in connection with infections in those with cystic fibrosis  <cit> . therefore, using qrt-pcr, we determined whether vfr regulates the expression of pa <dig> and pa <dig> in pao <dig>  we compared the expression of both genes in pao <dig> and its vfr isogenic mutant pao∆vfr at early  and mid  logarithmic phases of growth. as shown in figure  <dig>  at both time points and compared with pao <dig>  the expression of pa <dig> and pa <dig> was significantly reduced in pao∆vfr.

due to the presence of functional domains within the predicted protein encoded by pa <dig> , we decided to focus our effort on pa <dig>  we determined the regulation of pa <dig> expression by vfr throughout the growth cycle of pao <dig>  this was done using the pao <dig> mutant strain pw <dig>  which carries an in-frame pa2783::lacz chromosomal fusion in which the first nine amino acids of the pa <dig> protein are fused with the β-galactosidase protein  and the vfr multicopy plasmid pkf <dig>   <cit> . cells were grown in lb broth for 12 h. samples were obtained every 2 h and the levels of β-galactosidase activity was determined as previously described  <cit> . compared with pw <dig> carrying a vector control , pw5661/pkf <dig> produced a significantly higher level of pa <dig> expression from 2 h post-inoculation through 10 h, with a sharp peak of expression at 4 h post-inoculation  . following this peak, expression of pa <dig> gradually declined towards the 12 h time point  . this pattern of expression did not result from the effect of pkf <dig> on the growth of pw <dig> since its growth was comparable to that of pw <dig> containing the cloning vector . although in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the time point at which the highest level of pa <dig> expression was detected is different , the growth of pao <dig> at these two time points is close . this variation in the growth is possibly due to the presence of a plasmid in pao <dig> .

the qrt-pcr assay measures the accumulated pa <dig> mrna within the cell. all available evidence indicates that vfr is a transcriptional regulator  <cit> . pa2783::lacz is a translational fusion. thus, the unique pattern of pa <dig> expression throughout the growth cycle of pao <dig> is likely due to the effect of potential vfr-independent factors that regulate pa <dig> at the translational or post-translational level. the same pattern of expression likely exists in pw5661/pucp <dig>  however, due to the low level of pa <dig> transcription in this strain, we did not detect the pattern of pa <dig> expression . as pkf <dig> enhanced pa <dig> transcription, the pattern was detectable .

the pa <dig> protein carries a functional leader sequence
computer analysis revealed the presence of an export signal within the amino terminus region of the predicted protein encoded by pa <dig> . to examine this possibility experimentally, we first constructed a pa2783::phoa fusion plasmid. we synthesized an 1807-bp fragment containing the pa <dig> open reading frame  by pcr and cloned the fragment into pcr <dig> -topo . we then confirmed the presence of the insert in recombinant plasmid pab <dig> by dna sequence analysis  . the fragment containing pa <dig> was then subcloned into pucp <dig> generating recombinant plasmid pab <dig> . dna sequence analysis confirmed that, in pab <dig>  pa <dig> is expressed from the lac promoter . to determine if pa <dig> is exported across the cytoplasmic membrane, pab <dig> was transformed into the e. coli strain cc <dig> that carries transposon tnphoa . tnphoa mutagenesis was conducted as described in methods  <cit> . tnphoa carries the region that codes for the complete alkaline phosphatase protein minus the leader peptide; therefore, an in-frame fusion that provides the protein with a leader peptide would produce functional secreted alkaline phosphatase. we recovered several potential clones including pab <dig>  which was transformed into the e. coli alkaline phosphatase-deficient strain cc <dig> . the resulting transformants produced blue color colonies on xp indicator plates suggesting the presence of functional alkaline phosphatase. dna sequence analysis confirmed the fusion between the sequences that code for the first  <dig> aa of pa <dig> and the alkaline phosphatase protein . to confirm this result, cc118/pab <dig> was grown in lb broth for 6 h, the cells were fractionated, and the level of alkaline phosphatase activity within different fractions was determined  <cit> . alkaline phosphatase activity was detected in the periplasmic and membrane fractions and within the supernatant at a very low level . this strongly supports the possibility that pa <dig> carries a functional leader peptide.

next, we introduced pab <dig> in pao <dig> and examined the pattern of pa2783::phoa expression. pao1/pab <dig> was grown in lb broth for 11 h, samples were obtained every  <dig> to 3 h, cells were fractionated, and the level of alkaline phosphatase activity was determined. we detected alkaline phosphatase activity in both periplasmic and membrane fractions, with sufficient activity in the membrane fraction to determine levels throughout the growth cycle of pao1/pab <dig> . despite the difference between the lacz and phoa fusion analyses in the post-inoculation time points at which we detected certain aspects of pa <dig> regulation, the actual growth  at specific time points  was comparable  . the level of alkaline phosphatase activity in pao1/pab <dig> was high at early stages of growth , peaked at the 6-h time point , and declined over the remaining incubation period  . the level of alkaline phosphatase activity produced by the pa2783::phoa fusion is significantly lower than the level of β-galactosidase activity produced by the pa2783::lacz fusion . at this time, we do know the reason for the low level of alkaline phosphatase activity.

unlike the pa2783::lacz fusion experiments in which pa <dig> is expressed from the pa2782-pa <dig> promoter in the presence of multiple copies of vfr , in the phoa fusion experiments, pa <dig> is expressed from the lac promoter, which is constitutively expressed in p. aeruginosa. however, in both experiments, the pattern of pa <dig> expression throughout the growth cycle of pao <dig> is comparable . the enhancement of pa <dig> transcription in each experiment allowed the pattern to be observed. this further supports the possibility that the pattern of pa <dig> expression is produced by the translational or post-translational regulation of pa <dig> through vfr-independent factors.

predicted protein pa <dig> contains an endopeptidase domain and two carbohydrate binding modules
computer analysis of the 65-kda predicted protein encoded by pa <dig> using the signalp  <dig>  server revealed the presence of a typical p. aeruginosa type i export signal and cleavage site at the amino terminus     <cit> . additionally, no transmembrane regions were found within the predicted protein . the protein contains three specific domains, one at the amino terminus region and two at the carboxyl terminus region . the amino terminus domain  has characteristics of the m <dig> family of metalloendopeptidases, which include a conserved glutamate catalytic residue  and three zinc binding histidine residues  within the motif hexxhxxgxxh that is common to these proteins   <cit> . the two domains in the carboxy terminus region, located at aa 302– <dig> and aa 461– <dig> , exhibit homology with the carbohydrate -binding modules of the cbm_4_ <dig> family of diverse cho-binding proteins   <cit> . the strongest overall homology exists between the pa <dig> endopeptidase and the pseudomonas mendocina cho-binding cenc domain-containing protein and the ni,fe-hydrogenase i small subunit of hahella chejuensis kctc  <dig> . as with pa <dig>  both proteins contain the metalloendopeptidase domain and the cho-binding domains i and ii. the three proteins have several identical and homologous residues within each domain .

pa <dig> encodes a putative  <dig> -kda protein of  <dig> aa that contains no specific motifs, except for the presence of an alanine-rich region within its amino terminus , and that has no functional homology with other known proteins .

characterization of pa <dig>  a putative metalloendopeptidase
the predicted protein pa <dig> contains all the features of a potential endopeptidase including the putative glutamic acid catalytic residue and the three zinc-binding histidine residues within its amino terminus   <cit> . we tried to assess the proteolytic activity produced by pa <dig> using dialyzed brain heart infusion skim milk agar. however, this approach proved unfeasible due to the production by p. aeruginosa of several proteases with strong proteolytic activities. both pao1/pucp <dig> and pao1/pab <dig> produced identical clearing zones of protease activity . we faced the same problem when we utilized strain pao-r <dig> , which produces a considerably reduced level of proteolytic activity due to the mutation of lasr <cit> . despite the reduction in the extracellular proteolytic activity of this strain, pao-r1/pucp <dig> and pao-r1/pab <dig> produced identical clearing zones on skim milk agar . as an alternative, we assessed the potential proteolytic activity of pa <dig> using the e. coli strain dh5α . compared with dh5α/pucp <dig>  which produced no proteolytic zone, dh5α/pab <dig> produced a considerable zone of proteolytic activity  suggesting that the protein is a secreted protease. to examine this possibility, we grew dh5α/pab <dig> in lb broth, isolated the supernatant and concentrated it 20x using b <dig> minicon concentrators . however, the concentrated supernatant produced no zone of proteolytic activity on the skim milk agar . whether the growth conditions  played a role in the loss or retention of the extracellular protease activity is not known at this time.

using a previously described endopeptidase assay  <cit> , we tried to determine if at least part of the proteolysis observed on the skim milk plate was due to endopeptidase activity. however, dh5α/pab <dig> produced no detectable endopeptidase activity in initial experiments . this may be due to the difference in the length of the assays, as the skim milk plates were examined 48 h after inoculation, while the endopeptidase assay results were recorded within 30 min. to remedy this problem, we overproduced recombinant pa <dig>  using the pbad/his expression system . the 1807-bp fragment containing pa <dig> was cloned into the expression plasmid pbad/hisc  generating pab <dig> in which pa <dig> is expressed from the tightly regulated arabinose promoter . plasmid pab <dig> was transformed into the e. coli expression host lmg <dig> . we grew lmg194/pab <dig> in lb broth containing ranges of l-arabinose concentrations  to an od <dig> of about  <dig> , harvested the cells, and analyzed the protein profile of the lysate using sds-page. we examined the gels for a unique band that exists in the lysate from induced but not uninduced cultures. we obtained optimum induction using lb broth containing  <dig> % arabinose . lmg194/pab <dig> was grown in rm minimal medium supplemented with glucose overnight and subcultured into fresh rm minimal medium. at an od <dig> of  <dig> ,  <dig> % arabinose was added to induce expression of pa <dig> and incubation continued for 5 h. initial examination of total proteins from the whole cell lysate confirmed the overproduction of the protein. as shown in figure 6b, compared with proteins from the uninduced culture, a unique band that corresponds to the predicted  <dig> -kda recombinant pa <dig> protein  was detected in the induced culture. we extracted the band and determined the amino acid sequence of an internal peptide. the sequence matched  that of the predicted protein . using the cold osmotic shock procedure  <cit> , we fractionated the cells into supernatant, periplasmic, cytoplasmic, and outer membrane fractions and separated the proteins by sds-page. recombinant pa <dig> was localized to the membrane fraction . as overproduction of foreign proteins in e. coli often results in their seclusion in inclusion bodies, which localize with the membrane fraction, we attempted to solubilize rpa <dig>  despite trying numerous protocols, we failed to obtain a soluble protein with proteolytic activity. as an alternative, we purified the outer membrane fraction of lmg/pab <dig> and examined it for enzymatic activity  <cit> . we detected the  <dig> -kda rpa <dig> within the outer membrane preparation of the arabinose-induced cells only . this was confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis of an internal peptide obtained from the eluted protein . similarly, we detected the endopeptidase activity within the outer membrane of the arabinose-induced cultures only . these results suggest that p. aeruginosa pa <dig> encodes a membrane-bound 65-kda protein with endopeptidase activity. we propose the name mep <dig> for this protein that belongs to the metalloendopeptidase family m <dig> , and mep <dig> for the gene encoding it.

vfr regulates mep <dig> expression by specifically binding to its upstream region
vfr is a dna binding protein that regulates the expression of several genes including lasr, toxr, pvds, and ptxr by binding to the promoter region of these genes  <cit> . thus, vfr may regulate mep <dig> expression directly by binding to the upstream region of the pa2782-mep <dig> operon. analysis of the upstream region revealed the presence of a potential vfr-binding sequence located from − <dig> to − <dig> bp 5′ of the pa <dig> gtg codon and between the − <dig> and − <dig> sequences   <cit> . to determine if vfr binds to the pa2782-mep <dig> upstream region, we conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays . we purified recombinant vfr  as previously described  <cit> . since camp enhances vfr binding to its target sequences, we included camp in the dna binding reaction   <cit> . in the presence camp, rvfr produced a specific gel shift band with a 98-bp fragment of the upstream region  that carries the intact potential vfr binding sequence  . the binding required camp as we failed to detect a binding band when camp was eliminated from the binding reaction .

to localize vfr binding within the 98-bp fragment, we synthesized two fragments of the pa2783-mep <dig> upstream region that were sequentially smaller. a gel shift band was detected using probe ii, 61-bp fragment that included bp − <dig> to − <dig> . however, no gel shift band was detected in emsa using probe iii, a 50-bp fragment that included bp − <dig> to − <dig> . this suggests that within the 61-bp probe ii, the sequence 5′ of the consensus vfr binding site is essential for vfr binding to the upstream region of the pa2782-mep <dig> operon.

to further localize the region to which vfr binds, we conducted nested deletion experiments in which we synthesized several probes that carry nested deletions from the 3′ end of probe ii. the loss of up to 29 bp from the 3′ end  had no effect on vfr binding . however, the loss of  <dig> additional bp from probe vi, which deleted the consensus vfr binding site completely, eliminated vfr binding  . therefore, we localized vfr binding within the upstream region of pa2782-mep <dig> to a 33-bp region that carries only 6 bp of the consensus vfr binding sequence . these results suggest that, unlike other vfr-regulated genes, vfr binding to the pa2782-mep <dig> upstream region does not require the known vfr consensus sequence.

discussion
experiments described in this study indicate that the p. aeruginosa gene pa <dig> encodes a secreted endopeptidase, which we have named mep <dig>  the predicted protein, which has a typical leader peptide at its amino terminus, belongs to the m <dig> family of metallopeptidases  <cit> . according to the merops peptidase database, the p. aeruginosa mep <dig> is a member of the peptidyl-asp metallopeptidases , proteins that degrade aspartate containing substrates by cleaving peptide bonds at the amino side of aspartate or cysteic acid  <cit> . additional experiments would be needed to confirm such an activity.

p. aeruginosa produces at least three well characterized extracellular proteases/peptidases, lasb, lasa, and prpl. lasb is a metalloendopeptidase that belongs to the thermolysin  family  <cit> , lasa is a 20-kda zinc metalloendopeptidase that belongs to the β-lytic endopeptidase family   <cit> , and prpl is a 27-kda endopeptidase belonging to the serine endopeptidase family  <cit> . compared with these extracellular proteases, mep <dig> has several notable characteristics. first, it is less efficient in proteolytic activity. neither the loss of the functional gene in p. aeruginosa nor the presence of multiple copies of mep <dig>  in pao <dig> or pao-r <dig> enhanced the proteolytic activity . second, similar to lasb, lasa, prpl, and other p. aeruginosa proteases, mep <dig> is likely to be secreted to the extracellular environment. the lack of transmembrane regions within the predicted protein further supports this suggestion . the presence of lasb and other proteases within the pao <dig> supernatant prevented us from detecting mep <dig> proteolytic activity . we were fortunate to detect strong extracellular proteolytic activity in e. coli dh5α carrying a mep <dig> plasmid . however, similar to other p. aeruginosa proteins, when we overexpressed mep <dig> from the pbad inducible promoter, mep <dig> was trapped within the e. coli membranes  . we plan to produce polyclonal antibodies to the recombinant mep <dig> encoded by pab <dig> and utilize the antibodies to detect mep <dig> within the supernatant of pao <dig>  third, unlike lasb, lasa, and prpl, mep <dig> contains additional domains, two cho-binding modules at the carboxy terminus region . whether the cho-binding and the endopeptidase domains represent two separate functions of mep <dig> or are required for a single target is yet to be determined. fourth, lasb, lasa, and prpl are among the virulence factors whose production is stringently controlled by the qs system  <cit> . since the p. aeruginosa las and rhl qs systems are controlled by vfr, the three extracellular proteases are indirectly regulated by vfr  <cit> . in contrast, mep <dig>  which is directly controlled by vfr, may not be influenced by qs systems. through several preliminary experiments, we ruled out the possibility that mep <dig> expression is regulated by either the las or the rhl system . fifth, unlike other proteases, the impact of mep <dig> on p. aeruginosa virulence is not defined yet. the loss of functional mep <dig> in pao <dig> did not impact the production of several virulence factors including lasb, lasa, pyocyanin, or pyoverdine . additionally, preliminary analysis using the murine model of thermal injury showed that the in vivo virulence of pw <dig> is comparable to that of its parent strain .

the first such endopeptidase enzyme described was isolated from pseudomonas fragi, a pyschrotrophic, proteolytic organism that causes meat spoilage by producing a single extracellular neutral protease, endoproteinase asp-n, at lower temperatures  <cit> . as mep <dig> has amino acid identity with the p. fragi protein in the endopeptidase region , and since p. aeruginosa grows at 10°c, we examined the proteolytic activity of mep <dig> at this temperature. at this temperature, mep <dig> activity would not be masked by other p. aeruginosa extracellular proteases, which are activated at 37°c. however, we did not detect any difference in their proteolytic zones. the two cho-binding domains carried by mep <dig> belong to the cbm_4_ <dig> family. proteins in this family are important for very diverse cho metabolic processes including enzymatic degradation of oligosaccharides, cellulase activity and hydrolase activity by acting on glycosyl bonds  <cit> . whether the cbm_4_ <dig> domain in mep <dig> plays a role in p. aeruginosa binding to the alveolar mucus during lung infections is not known.

all available evidence, including data provided in this study, suggests that vfr is a dna-binding transcriptional regulator  <cit>  . using qrt-pcr, we also detected transcriptional regulation of mep <dig> expression by vfr . additionally, one of the unique features of mep <dig> is its pattern of expression throughout the growth cycle of pao <dig>  which we detected with both lacz and phoa translational fusions . in these experiments, mep <dig> expression was enhanced by the presence of multiple copies of vfr  or expression the lac promoter, which is constitutively expressed in p. aeruginosa . the same pattern likely exists in pao <dig> and pw <dig> carrying pucp <dig> ; however, due to the low level of mep <dig> expression, we did not detect it. these results strongly suggest that the unique pattern of mep <dig> expression is due to the effect of vfr-independent translational/post-translational regulation.

this pattern of expression is not a feature of the vfr regulon. many genes of the vfr regulon including lasb, lasa, lasr are part of the quorum sensing system and as such, expression is induced at later rather than earlier stages of growth  <cit> . the significance of this pattern of expression is not known at this time. however, during our analysis of the p. aeruginosa global regulator ptxr , we previously reported a pattern of expression that mimics that of pa2782-mep <dig> <cit> . the expression of one of the ptxr-promoter nested deletions reached a peak at early stage of growth, sharply declined after that, and continued a low level of expression toward the end of growth cycle  <cit> . similar to mep <dig>  vfr binds to the ptxr upstream and directly regulates ptxr expression  <cit> .

through the examination of the promoter regions of genes regulated by vfr including lasr, toxa, pvds, prpl, and algd, kanack et al. developed a 21-bp vfr binding consensus sequence that consist of two halves and contain several conserved nucleotides within each half  <cit> . experimental evidence revealed that changing one or more of these conserved nucleotides within the lasr or fleq promoters affected the expression of these genes and their regulation by vfr  <cit> . our current analysis confirmed that vfr specifically binds to the pa2782-mep <dig> promoter . as with other vfr-regulated genes, vfr binding to the pa2782-mep <dig> promoter is camp dependent . however, in contrast to all previously identified vfr binding sites, the potential vfr binding region within pa2782-mep <dig> does not contain the intact vfr consensus sequence . rather, we localized vfr binding within the pa2782-mep <dig> promoter to a 33-bp sequence , which contains only 6 bp from the left half of the vfr consensus sequence . careful examination of the sequence revealed the presence of a 5-bp imperfect inverted repeat, with two bp mismatch , at either end of the 33-bp sequence: tggcg-n22-cgctg . compromising either of the repeats eliminated vfr binding . thus, this sequence may constitute an alternative vfr binding site. the tggcg-n22-cgctg sequence overlaps the − <dig> region . additionally, the 33-bp sequence contains two direct repeats  . furthermore, the 33-bp sequence contains another imperfect  inverted repeat consisting of 9 bp, tggcgcaaa-n9-ttgccgcca. probe vii, which lost the ability to bind vfr, lacks only one bp  from the right side of this repeat . further analysis including dna foot printing experiments will be done to determine the exact sequence to which vfr binds.

CONCLUSIONS
pa <dig> and pa <dig> constitute an operon whose transcription is positively regulated by vfr. the expression of pa <dig> throughout the growth cycle of p. aeruginosa follows a unique pattern. pa <dig> codes for a secreted metalloendopeptidase, which we named mep <dig>  mep <dig>  which has metalloendopeptidase and carbohydrate-binding domains, produced proteolytic and endopeptidase activities in e. coli. vfr directly regulates the expression of the pa2782-mep <dig> operon by binding to its upstream region. however, unlike other vfr-targeted genes, vfr binding does not require an intact vfr consensus binding sequence.
