BACKGROUND
the evolution of multicellularity and the separation of germline cells from sterile somatic cells are certainly among the greatest innovations of eukaryotes. remarkably, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the shift from unicellular to multicellular organisms with differentiated cells was not a unique progression in the evolution of life, but it was, in fact, a frequent event  <cit> .

particularly with regard to questions related to the evolution of multicellularity and of the germ-soma dichotomy, the volvocine green algae within the volvocales  order are of special interest. the volvocine green algae form a closely related group of flagellated, photosynthetic, phototactic, facultatively sexual haploid eukaryotes which include unicellular, colonial and multicellular forms with differentiated cell types  <cit> . several genera of the volvocine lineage can be arranged in a conceptual series according to increasing morphologic and developmental complexity   <cit> . in this series there are progressive increases in cell number, organismal polarity, volume of extracellular matrix per cell, size of adult organisms, and the tendency to produce sterile, terminally differentiated somatic cells  <cit> . the unicellular alga chlamydomonas shows the simplest possible morphologic and developmental complexity in this conceptual series; the cell grows in size and cell division produces unicellular daughter cells. the colonial alga gonium has the shape of a slightly convex plate, typically containing 8-16-cells; all cells grow and divide to produce new colonies. pandorina forms a 16-celled ellipsoid colony; all its cells grow and divide. eudorina is a 16– <dig> celled, globular alga; generally, all cells of eudorina grow and divide, but in some instances the 2– <dig> most anterior cells fail to divide and act as somatic cells  <cit> . pleodorina is a 32– <dig> celled, globular alga, in which all anterior cells remain small and function as non-dividing somatic cells, while all posterior cells grow and divide. the multicellular, globular alga volvox exhibits the most advanced morphologic and developmental complexity in the volvocine lineage; it consists of many hundreds to thousands of cells and almost all cells terminally differentiate as small, biflagellate somatic cells, while only a very few cells grow up to many times their initial size and then divide to produce new individuals.

the diversity of volvocine forms provides an ideal model system for addressing fundamental molecular issues related to the transition to differentiated multicellularity. so far, the most intensively studied members of the volvocine algae group with sequenced genomes and well-established molecular-genetic tools are chlamydomonas reinhardtii <cit>  and volvox carteri <cit> . less research has been done into the molecular characteristics of volvocine genera with intermediate organizational complexity between unicellular forms and multicellular forms with fully differentiated somatic and germ cells; these genera include gonium <cit> , pandorina <cit> , eudorina <cit>  and pleodorina <cit> .

detailed molecular analyses of volvocine genera with intermediate organizational complexity require genetic manipulation. therefore, our goal was to establish the stable, nuclear transformation of e. elegans, a volvocine species with intermediate organizational complexity . molecular-genetic tools do currently not exist for e. elegans and this species has not been genetically engineered previously. we intended to develop a biolistic transformation method because previous biolistic methods were successful in three volvocine species, v. carteri <cit> , g. pectorale <cit> , and c. reinhardtii <cit> . it should be mentioned that transformation methods using glass beads  <cit>  or electroporation  <cit>  are inappropriate for eudorina because they require cell-wall deficient target cells, which do not exist for this species. moreover, only limited sequence information is available for eudorina, with the exception of several short dna fragments that have been used as phylogenetic marker sequences  <cit> .

an important prerequisite for transformation is a selectable marker gene for the identification of putative transformants. under the given conditions of eudorina, a heterologous, dominant marker was preferred because it allows for the transformation of wild-type strains, i.e., auxotrophic mutants are not required.

transformation protocols using the heterologous phleomycin-resistance  gene of streptoalloteichus hindustanus <cit>  as a dominant selectable marker have been established for c. reinhardtii <cit>  and v. carteri <cit> . the aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase viii  gene of streptomyces rimosus <cit>  has been used as a dominant marker in c. reinhardtii <cit> , g. pectorale <cit> , and v. carteri <cit> . additional dominant selectable markers have only been established in c. reinhardtii. the corresponding protocols utilize the r <dig>  plasmid/bacteriophage t4/synthetic aminoglycoside adenyltransferase  gene  <cit> , the streptomyces hygroscopicus aminoglycoside phosphotransferase  gene  <cit> , the mutated version of the protoporphyrinogen oxidase  gene  <cit> , the c. reinhardtii acetolactase synthase  gene  <cit> , and the mutated version of the c. reinhardtii ribosomal protein gene s <dig>   <cit> .

among the dominant selectable markers described above, only the aphviii gene  <cit>  and the ble gene  <cit>  have been used successfully for the transformation of more than one volvocine algae species. we decided to use the aphviii gene because it was successfully used in three volvocine species. furthermore, the aphviii gene encodes an enzyme and not simply a binding protein like ble, which requires a 1: <dig> ratio of expressed protein and antibiotic molecules. a heterologously expressed enzyme should allow for selection even in the event of a low expression rate.

selectable marker genes need to be expressed homogeneously in transgenic organisms using  promoters. therefore, established molecular tools for volvocine algae routinely utilize promoters of highly expressed endogenous genes. for example, the promoters of the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain  gene  <cit> , the psad gene of photosystem i  <cit> , a fused promoter containing part of the heat shock protein 70a  promoter and part of the rbcs <dig> promoter  <cit> , and another fused promoter containing part of the heat shock protein 70a  promoter and part of the β2-tubulin promoter   <cit>  have been utilized in c. reinhardtii. for v. carteri, the β-tubulin promoter  <cit> , the promoter of the arylsulfatase  gene  <cit> , and a hsp70a/rbcs <dig> fusion promoter  <cit>  have been established. because e. elegans has not been sequenced and because there were no endogenous promoter sequences available, we intended to test heterologous promoters. though promoter sequences are frequently species-specific, it has been shown that some promoters also work in related volvocine species  <cit> .

research with transgenic organisms also requires reporter genes. genes encoding the green fluorescent protein  of aequorea aequorea <cit> , the arylsulfatase  gene of v. carteri <cit> , the hexose/h+ symporter  gene of chlorella kessleri <cit> , and the luciferases of renilla reniformis   <cit>  and gaussia princeps   <cit>  have been used successfully in volvocine algae . for experiments in eudorina, a codon-adapted version of the g. princeps luciferase gene seemed suitable because luciferase exhibits a very high enzymatic activity even when expressed at low levels  <cit> . additionally, luciferase can be used for large-scale screening by a simple enzymatic assay, and it has been shown to work in two volvocine species, c. reinhardtii <cit>  and g. pectorale <cit> .

here, we demonstrate the stable nuclear transformation of e. elegans by particle bombardment using a chimeric, aphviii-based selectable marker gene driven by a tandem promoter of v. carteri. in addition, we demonstrate the expression of a heterologous reporter gene, the codon-optimized luciferase gene of g. princeps, driven by promoters of c. reinhardtii or v. carteri.

RESULTS
antibiotic tolerance of wild-type eudorina algae
the lowest concentration of the antibiotic paromomycin that still kills all wild-type eudorina cells was determined to allow for selection of transformants with potentially weak transgene-mediated resistance. to investigate the paromomycin tolerance of the wild-type e. elegans strain, identical numbers of cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of paromomycin, incubated for  <dig> days, and screened for living  or dead  cells. a concentration of  <dig>  μg paromomycin/ml or higher led to 100% cell death . processing of large-scale screenings of culture plates was facilitated by creating red-shifted, false-color images from standard photographs of the plates; this conversion allows for an objective and rapid discrimination between wells containing living cells and wells containing dead cells .

transformation experiments using an aphviii-based selectable marker
for the transformation of e. elegans, a chimeric, aphviii-based plasmid   <cit>  was used as a selectable marker. the ppmr <dig> plasmid contains the coding sequence of the original s. rimosus aphviii gene, a 5′-flanking sequence that includes an artificial tandem promoter from the hsp70a and rbcs <dig> genes of v. carteri, and a 3′-flanking sequence derived from the rbcs <dig> gene of v. carteri .

transformation of wild-type e. elegans cells was performed using a biolistic® pds-1000/he particle gun and dna-coated gold microprojectiles  <cit> . for the transformation, approximately 3 ×  <dig> logarithmically growing eudorina algae were harvested by centrifugation; this corresponds to approximately 9 ×  <dig> target cells. the algae were immobilized on a membrane filter, and excess liquid was removed. during development of the transformation protocol, transformation parameters were modified until paromomycin-resistant transformants were obtained . the protocol was then modified to increase the number of transformants. the most successful combination of parameters for transformation of e. elegans is summarized in additional file  <dig>  the transformation protocol included the use of microprojectiles with a diameter of  <dig>  μm, which were coated with  <dig> μg of the selectable marker plasmid ppmr <dig> and, where applicable ,  <dig> μg of a non-selectable, co-transformed plasmid. the burst pressure of the rupture discs was  <dig>  psi, and the distance between the rupture disc and the macrocarrier was adjusted to  <dig> mm. the distance between the macrocarrier and the stopping screen was set to  <dig> mm, and the distance between the stopping screen and target cells was adjusted to  <dig> cm. after a recovery phase of  <dig> h in standard liquid medium, the antibiotic resistant transformants were selected by the addition of paromomycin . it should be noted that all transformants exhibited the same morphological phenotype as their wild-type parental strain. the detailed transformation protocol is provided in the methods section. after establishing the transformation protocol, each transformation experiment yielded approximately 3– <dig> antibiotic resistant clones.

antibiotic resistance of transformants
transformants from five independent transformation experiments  were tested for their maximal antibiotic resistance. the paromomycin resistance of the clones varied, with a wide range from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml ; however, there was little variation for a given clone. the transformants with the lowest resistance to paromomycin treatment were capable of surviving in 33-fold higher concentrations of paromomycin than parental wild-type strains, which tolerated only up to  <dig>  μg paromomycin/ml. the transformants with the most robust resistance tolerated concentrations of antibiotic up to 333-fold higher than the wild-type strains. the variation in resistance between different clones could reflect position effects on expression of the transgene due to random integration or could reveal gene-dosage effects caused by variable number of copies integrated into the genome.

stable integration of plasmid dna into the genome of transformants
the stable integration of the selectable marker gene  into the genome of the  <dig> clones from five independent transformation experiments was verified by pcr using aphviii-specific oligonucleotide primers  and genomic dna as the template. a pcr fragment of the expected size was obtained from all paromomycin-resistant clones; as expected, the parental wild-type strain failed to produce this fragment . the pcr fragment was verified by sequencing .

in addition, genomic dna from transformants and from the parental wild-type strain was analyzed by southern blot for integration of the aphviii gene into the genome. a fragment of the aphviii coding region  was used as a probe for the southern blot. hybridization signals were detectable only in transformants and not for the parental strain. a southern blot result for two randomly chosen transformants and the parental wild-type is shown in figure 4b. based on the sequence of ppmr <dig>  a hybridization signal of  <dig>  kb was expected following digestion with hindiii, and this fragment was observed following the digestion of transformant genomic dna. at least two additional bands were detectable in hindiii-digested samples, which could indicate additional incomplete or fragmented integration of the selectable marker plasmid . the ppmr <dig> plasmid contained only a single bamhi site. therefore, the second bamhi site of the bamhi fragments must be located within the genomic sequence flanking the integrated plasmid, and detection of more than one bamhi hybridization signal indicates multiple integration events in different areas of the genome. up to five signals were detected in bamhi-digested genomic dna of transformants, which indicates that up to five integration events occurred . however, several of these ppmr <dig> fragments may contain an incomplete selectable marker gene as indicated by the hindiii digests. the antibiotic resistance of transformants demonstrates that at least one copy of the selectable marker gene is complete. the southern blot experiments indicate that particle gun transformation of e. elegans often leads to more than one integration event, but the number of integration events is quite low .

calculation of transformation frequency
the frequency of transformation was calculated as the ratio between the number of transformants that exhibited both antibiotic resistance and the correct aphviii fragment following pcr and the total number of cells used for each transformation experiment . based on  <dig> independent transformation experiments, the transformation frequency was calculated as  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  transformants per cell. assuming that all of the e. elegans colonies used for transformation contained  <dig> cells, the calculated transformation frequency corresponds to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  transformants per organism.

stable co-transformation with non-selectable reporter gene plasmids
construction of transformation vectors with selectable markers and non-selectable genes of interest in the same plasmid is frequently hampered by the large size of the final plasmid and by inappropriate positions of required restriction sites. therefore, selectable markers and genes of interest have been frequently introduced on different plasmids by co-transformation of volvocine species  <cit> .

to investigate the efficiency of co-transformation in eudorina, we used ppmr <dig> as a selectable marker plasmid, which contains the aphviii gene, in conjunction with one of three different non-selectable reporter gene plasmids. the non-selectable reporter plasmids contain the gluc reporter gene from the g. princeps copepod, which was previously engineered to match the codon usage of c. reinhardtii <cit> , and different heterologous flanking sequences including promoters from c. reinhardtii and v. carteri. the ppsad-gluc plasmid contains the gluc gene, a 5′-flanking sequence of the c. reinhardtii psad gene , and a 3′-flanking sequence from the psad gene   <cit>  . the phsp70a-gluc plasmid contains a 5′-flanking sequence from the c. reinhardtii hsp70a gene, which includes the hsp70a promoter and the 5′-utr  <cit>  . this sequence is fused to a genomic fragment of the c. reinhardtii hsp70b gene, which contains the first two exons and a small part of the third exon of hsp70b. the fragment also contains the two original introns of the hsp70b gene, and the exons of the hsp70b fragment encode the chloroplast transit peptide of hsp70b  <cit> . the gluc gene is fused downstream of the hsp70b sequence, and gluc is followed by the 3′-flanking sequence of the c. reinhardtii rbcs <dig> gene, which includes the 3′-utr . the phrlucp plasmid contains the gluc gene flanked by a v. carteri hsp70a/rbcs <dig> hybrid sequence on its 5′-side; this sequence includes the hsp70a/rbcs <dig> tandem promoter and a 5′-utr. on the 3′-side of the gluc gene, the 3′-flanking sequence of the c. reinhardtii psad gene follows, which includes the 3′-utr . both the c. reinhardtii hsp70a promoter in the phsp70a-gluc plasmid and the v. carteri hsp70a part of the tandem promoter in the phrlucp plasmid are known to increase transcription following a period of elevated temperature.

the wild-type e. elegans strain was co-bombarded with the selectable marker plasmid  and with one of the non-selectable plasmids  . the presence of the co-bombarded plasmids in the genome of the transformants was verified by pcr using gluc-specific oligonucleotide primers and genomic dna as the template. the expected pcr fragment of gluc  was detected in almost all of the paromomycin-resistant transformants , and the identity of the pcr fragment was verified by sequence analysis . in detail, five co-transformation experiments with ppmr <dig> and the non-selectable plasmids ppsad-gluc, phsp70a-gluc, and phrlucp yielded  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> paromomycin-resistant transformants, respectively. of these,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  transformants contained the non-selectable reporter genes. based on these results, the co-transformation rate was calculated to be  <dig> - 100%.

moreover, the stable integration of the gluc gene into the genome of eudorina as well as the copy number of the integrations was investigated by southern blot analyses using a gluc-specific probe. the southern blot results for two randomly chosen transformants are shown in figure 5b. for hybridization experiments with hindiii-digested genomic dna from co-transformants, a dna fragment of  <dig> bp was expected, and fragments were detected in co-transformants. likewise, hybridization to bamhi-digested dna was expected to produce a  <dig> bp fragment, and this fragment was detected in the genomic dna of transformants . in addition, hybridization signals of various sizes were detected in several co-transformants , indicating additional integration of reporter gene fragments. however, the number of these fragment integrations was below five.

transcription of co-transformed, non-selectable reporter genes
total rna of the transformants and gluc-specific oligonucleotide primers were used for rt-pcr to investigate the transcription of the heterologous gluc gene under the control of heterologous promoters from v. carteri and c. reinhardtii in transgenic in e. elegans strains. a 342-bp cdna fragment of gluc was expected following rt-pcr . the gluc cdna fragments were obtained from transformants that contained the chimeric gluc genes following co-transformation with the ppsad-gluc, phrlucp, and phsp70a-gluc plasmids . the identity of the rt-pcr fragments was verified by sequence analysis . as expected, wild-type parental strains did not produce this fragment . thus, the chimeric, non-selectable gluc reporter gene was successfully transcribed in e. elegans transformants under the control of various heterologous promoters from v. carteri and c. reinhardtii.

analysis of heterologous protein expression in co-transformants
all transformants that contained the co-transformed gluc-construct in their genomes were analyzed for functional expression of the luciferase enzyme. the parental wild-type strain was used as a negative control. a luminometer was used to quantify luciferase activity following cultivation of the strains under standard conditions, and luminescence values were recorded as relative light units  .

among those that were co-transformed with the ppsad-gluc plasmid, only a single co-transformant, eutj- <dig>  exhibited strong luciferase activity  . the parental wild-type strain only produced a very low background value .

contrary to the result with ppsad-gluc co-transformants, several phrlucp co-transformants exhibited strong luciferase activity . like in the previous experiment, the background value of the wild-type strain was very low . it should be noted that the luciferase activity levels in co-transformants were quite variable. for example, the enzymatic activity of co-transformants euhr- <dig>  and euhr- <dig>  differed by a factor of nearly  <dig> . the luciferase activity in the euhr- <dig> strain was the highest luciferase activity detected among all transformants generated using the gluc gene .

also among the co-transformants produced using the phsp70a-gluc plasmid, several strains exhibited strong luciferase activity . the lowest activity was detected in co-transformant euhsp- <dig> , and the highest activity was observed in euhsp- <dig> . the enzymatic activity of phsp70a-gluc co-transformants differed by a factor of about  <dig> 

in all luciferase-expressing co-transformants, the enzymatic activity was stable. thus, even the extreme variability in luciferase activity between different transformants was permanent.

inducibility of heterologous protein expression
inducible promoters are useful tools in gene technology, and the heat shock promoters used here are induced at elevated temperatures, at least in the species where they originate. to investigate the inducibility of the v. carteri hsp70a/rbcs <dig> promoter of the phrlucp plasmid  and the c. reinhardtii hsp70a promoter of the phsp70a-gluc plasmid , which drive the gluc gene in transgenic e. elegans, the corresponding transformants were exposed to elevated temperatures, and the luciferase activity was measured. thus, cultures were incubated at different temperatures ranging from 27°c to 57°c . cultures were then allowed to recover at 27°c , harvested by centrifugation, and disrupted by sonification, and finally, the luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer. induction factors were calculated by comparing luminescence values with untreated, reference cultures of the same strain; reference cultures were kept at standard conditions . the strongest luciferase activity induction was achieved in cultures that were incubated at 42°c . the highest induction factor obtained at 42°c was  <dig>  and was observed in a strain generated by co-transformation with the phsp70a-gluc plasmid . transformants generated by co-transformation with phrlucp revealed an up to  <dig> -fold induction . the wild-type strain and the transformants generated with the ppsad-gluc plasmid, which does not contain a heat-inducible promoter, exhibited no induction of luciferase activity, as expected . thus, both the hsp70a-promoter of c. reinhardtii and the hsp70a promoter of v. carteri are heat-inducible even when utilized in e. elegans.

we investigated the detection of light in heat-induced transformants using a digital camera and a light-sensitive film in order to optimize the assay for high-throughput setups. logarithmically growing cultures were divided into two cultures, and one was subjected to temperature of 42°c. the other was maintained at 27°c as described above. following cell lysis, the transformants were assayed for luciferase activity in 24-well tissue culture plates . the bioluminescence of heat-shocked transformants was not only strong enough to generate a signal on light-sensitive film , but the luminescence was also visible to the naked eye in the dark room and detectable by a standard digital camera .

in-gel activity assays
the utility of a heterologous reporter gene in e. elegans would increase if the gene product could be easily detected even in raw cell extracts after separation on standard sds-page, which could allow for simple detection and size determination of fusion proteins that contain the gluc reporter. for the expression product of the gluc gene encoded by the phrlucp plasmid, an expected molecular weight of  <dig> kda was calculated based on the amino acid sequence of the gluc protein. for the hsp70b/gluc fusion protein encoded by phsp70a-gluc, which contains the hsp70b chloroplast transit peptide, an expected molecular mass of  <dig> kda was calculated.

protein extracts of transformants generated by co-transformation with the phrlucp or phsp70a-gluc plasmid were separated by standard sds-page  <cit>  without using thiol reagents. after electrophoresis, in-gel renaturation of luciferase was achieved in the presence of β-cyclodextrin, a cyclic oligosaccharide  <cit> . the renatured enzyme was assayed in the gel by addition of the substrate and detection of bioluminescence on light-sensitive film. in these in-gel-luciferase activity assays, co-transformants generated with the phrlucp plasmid exhibited strong luciferase signals of the expected size  . co-transformants generated with phsp70a-gluc also showed strong signals of approximately  <dig> kda , indicating that the heterologous hsp70b chloroplast transit peptide of c. reinhardtii is cleaved in e. elegans.

long-term stability of dna integration and gene expression
the long-term stability of transgenes, which have been randomly integrated into the genome, and the perpetuation of their expression are beneficial for any genetically engineered organism.

the stability of the aphviii and gluc transgenes within the genomes of transgenic e. elegans strains was investigated by re-examining the  <dig> transformants for resistance to paromomycin and luciferase activity after  <dig> months without any selective pressure, which reflects  <dig> generations of cultivation. even after this period, the resistance of the transformants to paromomycin, which was determined at the highest possible antibiotic concentrations, varied by only approximately ± 5% from the values determined at the initial time-point . likewise, the luciferase activity in transformants differed from the initial values by only approximately ± 6%. thus, the integration and expression of the heterologous aphviii and gluc genes are stable in e. elegans.

discussion
stable nuclear transformation of e. elegans is now feasible using a chimeric selectable marker from a heterologous source. additionally, chimeric reporter gene constructs and constitutive and inducible promoters are provided without using endogenous genes or dna elements. we also demonstrate that inducible, heterologous promoters can retain their inducibility in the new cellular environment of the target species.

the frequency of transformation for e. elegans was estimated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> transformants per cell. a comparable value of  <dig>  –  <dig>  × 10- <dig> transformants per cell has been reported for the related g. pectorale species  <cit> . the transformation frequency in c. reinhardtii was calculated as  <dig>  -  <dig>  × 10- <dig> transformants per cell  <cit> , which is similar to the values above. in v. carteri, the transformation frequency was calculated per organism and not per cell; this value was reported to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> <cit> . the authors used a v. carteri mutant, which carries a mutation that causes somatic cells to redifferentiate as asexual reproductive cells. if approximately  <dig> of the 2000– <dig> cells composing this mutant actually reproduced, the estimated transformation frequency per cell would be approximately  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which is similar to the rates mentioned above. thus, the reported transformation frequencies for all of the investigated volvocine species appear to be quite similar.

co-transformation of a selectable marker plasmid and the gene of interest on a separate plasmid is a convenient strategy for dealing with large genes and complex gene constructs  <cit> . moreover, the same selectable marker plasmid can be used for all transformation experiments. the co-transformation rate in e. elegans was determined to be  <dig> - 100%. for v. carteri, rates of  <dig> - 60%  <cit>  or  <dig> - 80%  <cit>  have been reported. the co-transformation rates for c. reinhardtii are 50%  <cit>  or approximately 80%  <cit> , and a co-transformation rate of  <dig> - 50%  <cit>  has been reported for g. pectorale. however, the varying co-transformation rates reported for different volvocine species may not represent species-specific values, but they could be the result of different plasmid sequences, plasmid sizes, or transformation conditions. although the co-transformation rates vary over a wide range in volvocine algae , all rates are quite high, and therefore, co-transformation can be used routinely in all volvocine species. even the lowest rate of 10% means that one co-transformant with the gene of interest can be identified from only ten antibiotic-resistant transformants, which can be easily detected by pcr. therefore, transformation of volvocine algae does not require construction of vectors that contain all required genes and regulatory elements on a single plasmid.

the transformation protocol for e. elegans described above can now also be used for insertional mutagenesis of the e. elegans genome, which has been done in c. reinhardtii <cit> . insertional mutagenesis is one of the most powerful methods for determining the cellular function of a particular gene. for insertional mutagenesis, the ppmr <dig> plasmid  could be used as currently constructed; the plasmid only needs to be linearized . fortunately, the number of integrated copies of the transforming plasmid was low in our e. elegans transformation experiments, and these values were comparable to the copy numbers reported for insertional mutagenesis studies in c. reinhardtii <cit> . insertional loss-of-function mutants can be screened for developmental or physiological phenotypes, and the disrupted genes flanking the transforming dna can be amplified from insertional mutants using thermal asymmetric interlaced -pcr  <cit> , sequenced, and characterized.

CONCLUSIONS
both heterologous coding regions and promoters from related volvocine species work in e. elegans and drive both constitutive and inducible expression of heterologous genes. the availability of a transformation system, constitutive and inducible promoters, selectable markers, and reporter genes now makes extensive engineering of e. elegans possible. the results also demonstrate that genetic engineering of a species is possible even without endogenous genes and promoters.
