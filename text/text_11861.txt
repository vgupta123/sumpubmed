BACKGROUND
tses are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, caused by prions . these infectious particles are alternatively folded forms of the endogenous protein prpc, encoded by prnp  <cit> . conversion of prpc into prpsc requires the presence of prpsc and probably also of a not identified species-specific protein, 'protein x'  <cit> .

in sheep, tse susceptibility is influenced by polymorphisms of the prnp gene, with the alleles coding for alanine, arginine and arginine at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the prion protein associated with a high resistance to classical scrapie and bse  <cit> . nevertheless, this resistance is not absolute, since it has been shown that atypical scrapie can occur in sheep with the genotype arr/arr  <cit> , sheep with this genotype can be artificially infected with bse  <cit>  and infectivity has been detected in the spleen of an arr/arr sheep, experimentally infected with bse  <cit> . moreover, the presumed resistance of arr/arr sheep might be due to a longer incubation period in these animals and subclinically infected sheep might transmit tse infections unnoticed  <cit> . therefore, there is growing interest in other genes and proteins which could have an influence on tse susceptibility in sheep.

one of these genes is prnd, a prnp homologue found near the prnp gene and having structural and biochemical similarities with prnp. however, no clear influence of prnd on tse susceptibility has been found to date  <cit> . also, a number of proteins with a high affinity for the prion protein, among which the 37-kda/67-kda laminin receptor, have been discovered  <cit>  and could be important as 'protein x' candidates. in addition, gene expression studies in the brain of scrapie-infected mice have identified a large number of genes, potentially involved in the pathogenesis of tses  <cit> .

based on comparative genomics, premzl et al.  <cit>  have discovered sprn, a new candidate gene which codes for the shadoo protein of 130– <dig> amino acids. this gene has already been described in man, mouse, rat, fish  <cit>  and cow  <cit>  and is predicted in chimpanzee . the shadoo protein has also been identified in sumatran orang-utan, rhesus macaque, white-tufted-ear marmoset, rabbit, guinea pig, dog, little brown bat, gray short-tailed opossum, chicken and western clawed frog  <cit> . an evolutionary model proposes that sprn shares a common ancestor with prnp  <cit> , since it presents several important similarities with prnp. first, the open reading frame of sprn is located entirely in the last exon, with one preceding non-coding exon   <cit> . in addition, shadoo is predicted to be extracellular and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored. moreover, the most remarkable structural feature of shadoo is the presence of a hydrophobic sequence, composed of aliphatic amino acids and very similar to the hydrophobic sequence typically found in prp and prp-like proteins  <cit> .

apart from the structural similarities between sprn and prnp, the expression profile of sprn also makes this gene an interesting candidate for further research. according to the results of rt-pcr and northern blot analyses in cow  <cit> , rt-pcr in rat  <cit> , and cdna, est and sage map data in man and mouse  <cit> , sprn is mainly expressed in brain tissue, the most important target organ for prion infections. since prp knock-out mice  <cit>  and cattle lacking the prion protein  <cit>  show no major phenotypic changes, another gene, possibly sprn, might take over the physiological function of the prion protein.

in this study, the genomic region containing sprn in sheep was investigated using comparative mapping and sequencing and transcription profiling of the sprn gene were performed.

RESULTS
construction and annotation of a bac mini-contig containing sprn
the construction of a bac contig containing sprn was started by screening the inra ovine bac library with primers based on the genes paox and cyp2e <dig>  with paox approximately  <dig>  bp proximal from sprn and cyp2e <dig> approximately  <dig>  bp distal from sprn, according to the human genome sequence. one bac clone was found with the paox primers  and two with the cyp2e <dig> primers . primers based on bess of oaribac273h <dig> and oaribac265g <dig> did not permit to identify overlapping clones. therefore, a new screening of the ovine bac library was performed with the oaribac273h <dig> up primers, resulting in the identification of two new bac clones . primers based on oaribac161g <dig> bes  showed an overlap between the paox and the cyp2e <dig> subcontig. the total mini-contig thus consists of five bac clones and is shown in figure  <dig>  based on a comparison with the human genome sequence, the contig can be estimated to cover approximately  <dig>  bp.

both bess and internal bac sequences were used to annotate the contig. sequencing of the bess of the five clones resulted in ten sequences, of which four contain a high amount of repeat sequences . three bess could be annotated, one  by comparison with the human genome sequence , and two  by comparison with bovine genes, showing homology with the intron sequence of respectively echs <dig>  and paox . three bess revealed no relevant homology. detailed information on the bess is given in table  <dig> 

318–426: l1mc <dig> 
comparison of internal bac sequences with the human genome sequence revealed the presence of echs <dig>  paox, mtg <dig>  sprn, loc <dig>  cyp2e <dig> and at least partial presence of syce <dig> in the contig. this is the first time that these genes have been identified in sheep. due to lack of publicly available sequences in sheep or any related species, no suitable primers could be designed for the genes or6l2p and or7m1p, two genes also present in the human genome sequence corresponding to the sheep contig. primers based on human sequences were tested for these genes, but no pcr product could be created on sheep dna. all pcr products show a high level of homology with the human genome sequence, except that of mtg <dig>  which shows homology only with the bovine sequence, probably because of the high intron content of the pcr product. nucleotide identity and amino acid identity and positivity  of the amplicons with known sequences are shown in table  <dig> 

btauechs <dig> : 96/87/94
btaupaox : 95/98/100
btaucyp2e <dig> : 98/97/100
for amplicons containing both exon and intron sequences , sequence identity and positivity is shown for the exon parts of the amplicon.

order as well as orientation of the identified genes present in the sheep contig are identical to those of the corresponding region in man , supporting conserved linkage between these species. in cattle, paox has an opposite orientation . remarkably, the block echs <dig>  paox, mtg <dig> and sprn seems highly conserved, as it is also found in man, mouse and even fugu  <cit> . the scavenger receptor close to sprn in man and mouse, mentioned by premzl et al.  <cit> , is probably loc <dig> , and is therefore also present in the sheep contig.

fish mapping of the contig
fish mapping positioned clones oaribac273h <dig> and oaribac265g <dig> on chromosome oari22q <dig> . these results are in accordance with the heterologous chromosome painting data reported by iannuzzi et al., showing correspondences between the distal part of human chromosome  <dig> and sheep chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the presence of oaribac273h <dig> and oaribac265g <dig>  the most exterior bac clones of the contig, on the same chromosome location, shows that no chromosome jumping has taken place during the construction of the contig. localization of the contig maps the genes echs <dig>  paox, mtg <dig>  sprn, loc <dig>  cyp2e <dig> and syce <dig> to oari22q <dig> 

sequencing sprn in sheep
sequencing of the sprn gene was started with primers based on the bovine sequence nw_ <dig> . next, primers based on the sheep sprn sequence obtained during this work and primers based on the bovine sequence dq <dig> were used . the overlapping amplicons resulted in a sequence of  <dig>  bp, covering the entire sprn gene and a stretch of  <dig> bp of the promoter region . exon  <dig> has a length of  <dig> bp, intron  <dig> a length of  <dig> bp and exon  <dig> a length of  <dig> bp, of which  <dig> bp are coding sequence. all overlaps between the different amplicons  were 100% identical. the intron/exon splice sites and the position of the coding sequence were determined by comparison with the bovine  and human  sprn sequences. the 3' end of the gene was determined by sequencing cdna from cerebrum mrna.

the coding sequence of sheep sprn has 93% respectively 78% nucleic acid identity, and 95% respectively 76% amino acid identity with cow and man. the complete sequence obtained here  has 92% nucleic acid identity with the bovine sprn sequence . the gc content of the coding sequence in sheep is high , as in cow  and man . the overall gc content of the obtained sprn sequence in sheep is 70%.

comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence between sheep and other mammals reveals a high level of conservation in the typical hydrophobic region of sprn . this hydrophobic sequence, containing the palindrome sequence agaaaga, is a typical characteristic of sprn and is very similar to the hydrophobic region found in prp and prp-like proteins  <cit> . in prion protein, this region has remained highly conserved during evolution  <cit>  and thus may be an important functional region. the synthetic peptide prp 106– <dig>  containing the hydrophobic sequence, has been shown neurotoxic in vitro and in vivo  <cit>  and this neurotoxicity seems to depend on the presence of the palindrome sequence  <cit> . the hydrophobic region also plays a role in the conversion of prpc into prpsc. prpc without the palindrome sequence can not be converted into prpsc  <cit>  and does not bind with prpsc or prp 106– <dig>  <cit> . moreover, a prp transgene expressing a mutant prp with a deletion of the palindrome region acts as a dominant-negative mutant, inhibiting the conversion of wild-type prpc into prpsc  <cit> .

transcription profiling of sprn by rt-pcr
after isolation of total rna and subsequent conversion to cdna, the presence of sprn transcripts was examined by rt-pcr with sprn primer no.  <dig> in  <dig> different tissues. the rt-pcr, performed in triplicate, showed high levels of sprn mrna in cerebrum and cerebellum  and low levels in testis, lymph node, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum . no sprn mrna was detected in obex, spleen, kidney, liver, lung, heart, muscle, tongue, rumen, omasum, abomasum, duodenum and caecum. an rt-pcr with sprn primer no.  <dig>  also performed in triplicate, on the same tissues showed similar patterns. the results of a control pcr with actb primers are shown in figure 4b.

these results of the transcription profiling in sheep are in good agreement with the data available in other species. results of rt-pcr and northern blot analyses in cattle  <cit> , rt-pcr in rat  <cit>  and cdna, est and sage map data analyses in man and mouse  <cit>  all show that expression of sprn is highest in brain tissue. comparison of the sprn transcription profile of the non-brain tissues between sheep and other species is more difficult, as the transcription level is lower in the other positive tissues, in sheep as well as in cow and rat.

transcription profiling was performed by rt-pcr. this method permits the rapid testing of a large number of different tissues for the presence of a certain transcript. rt-pcr does not give detailed quantitative information on expression, therefore more time consuming methods like real-time pcr or real competitive pcr are needed  <cit> . however, rt-pcr results give an overall view and can be the basis to choose tissues of interest for more extended, quantitative experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, sprn as well as six genes surrounding the sprn locus, echs <dig> paox,mtg <dig> loc <dig> cyp2e <dig> and syce <dig>  have been identified in sheep for the first time. a contig containing these genes was constructed and annotated, suggesting conserved linkage between sheep and man in this region. the contig was fish mapped to oari22q <dig>  a  <dig>  bp fragment was also sequenced, covering the entire sprn gene and  <dig> bp of the promoter region. a high level of sequence homology was found with the bovine sprn and, to a lesser extent, with the human sprn. in addition, the transcription profile of sprn was determined in  <dig> ovine tissues, confirming that sprn is mainly expressed in brain tissue. these results are the first description of the sprn gene in sheep and should be useful as a basis for further research on this prion-like protein.
