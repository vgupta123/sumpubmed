BACKGROUND
major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules play an important role in antigen presentation, with the binding antigen peptide as a key step in initiating the specific immune response. in this process, the invariant chain  acts as a chaperone for the correct folding and the functional stability of mhc ii molecules 
 <cit> . ii is described initially as a nonpolymorphic type ii integral membrane protein 
 <cit> , binding mhc ii α and β chains to form αβ/ii complexes. these αβ/ii complexes have been identified on b cell and dendritic cell surfaces 
 <cit> . in epithelial cells, the endocytosis of αβ/ii complexes is highly dependent on the ii di-leucine motif 
 <cit> . ii limits hla-dr egress from the endoplasmic reticulum 
 <cit>  and prevents loading of self-peptide 
 <cit> . in immature lysosomes, ii is proteolyzed 
 <cit> , and its class ii-associated invariant chain peptide  is replaced by an antigenic peptide 
 <cit> . in b cells, the major pathway of ii-associated mhc class ii molecules involves direct access to the endolysosomal compartments for peptide loading 
 <cit> .

the mouse ii isoform ii <dig> consists of the cytosolic and transmembrane domains and luminal domain that contains clip and the trimerization region 
 <cit> . the cytosolic domain  contains an endosome-targeting signal that is essential for ii targeting to the endosomal compartment, via the plasma membrane alone or the mhc class ii complex 
 <cit> . the transmembrane domain  plays a key role in the formation of ii trimers 
 <cit>  and in the degradation of ii 
 <cit> , thereby influencing mhc class ii molecular functions, including complex formation and antigen presentation 
 <cit> . the clip binds mhc class ii peptide binding region  and interacts with class ii molecules 
 <cit> . the trimerization region is involved in the generation of this endosomal localization signal 
 <cit> .

a method to increase antigen-specific stimulation of t-helper cells entails the use of the ii hybrids, in which a four-amino-acid sequence  is linked to t-helper epitopes 
 <cit> , or the ii peptide  region is replaced with the various epitopes 
 <cit> . animal models illustrate the efficiency of ii hybrid methodology in using melanoma peptides 
 <cit> , subvirion influenza a  ha 
 <cit> , human papilloma virus  <dig> e <dig> 
 <cit> , listeria th 
 <cit>  and hepatitis c virus 
 <cit>  epitopes. the mechanistic hypothesis states that the ii -key binds initially to an allosteric site just outside the mhc class ii binding groove at the cell surface 
 <cit> . this induces a conformational change in the trough, facilitating antigenic epitope charging 
 <cit> , and a concomitant increase in the potency of antigen presentation compared with the unmodified class ii epitope 
 <cit> . as vector, ii-key and ii can enhance the interferon γ and interleukin - <dig> or il- <dig> responses in enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay 
 <cit> , epitope-specific cd4+ t cell activation 
 <cit> , or specific antibody production 
 <cit> . the ii-hybrids can also function in desensitizing allergy 
 <cit>  and inducing antigen-specific tolerance and ameliorating arthritis 
 <cit> . all these findings indicate potential clinical use of such allosteric site-directed, ii-segment drugs 
 <cit> .

the ii-key lies outside the n-terminal of clip and plays an important role in clip loading in the mhc ii pbr. hypothetically, the dn  segment, lying just outside the c-terminal of clip , would promote epitope association with the pbr, in a similar manner to the ii-key. furthermore, some of the ii-segments have a potential immune function 
 <cit> . the cytosolic and transmembrane domains are involved in localization and binding to mhc class ii molecules, with the former containing an endosome-targeting signal 
 <cit> . it is unclear whether the ii-segments in the hybrids are able to induce a conformational change that enables antigenic peptide charging, stabilizing the mhc ii/peptide complexes and enhancing specific immune responses, when ii hybrid binds mhc ii molecules to form complexes, in which the epitope binds to the pbr and the other segments to the non-pbr. therefore, we constructed such hybrids to determine their binding effect with mhc ii molecules, and antibody production.

RESULTS
construction and identification of the ii-segment epitope hybrids
we amplified ii-segments from the mouse ii cdna generated in our previous work 
 <cit> , and then constructed the hybrids containing fusion genes of ii-segments and a multiepitope containing three potential epitopes, named f <dig> 
 <cit> , from newcastle disease virus fusion protein . a schematic diagram in figure 
1a shows the structures of these hybrids. after identification with electrophoresis and sequencing, they   were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vectors pmcherry-c <dig> for transfection or the prokaryotic expression vectors to construct pgex-4 t- <dig> for expression in escherichia coli for immunization . pet-32a-f <dig> was constructed in order to purify f <dig> multiepitope which in turn was used as a coating antigen for elisa. these expressed proteins were purified and identified . additionally, mouse h2-aa, h2-ab and full-length ii genes  were also amplified and inserted in eukaryotic expression vectors  for transfection, immunoprecipitation or western blotting, respectively. 

the design of all the primers was based on the reported cdna sequences: mouse ii from genbank id: nm_ <dig>  mouse h2-aa from genbank id: nm_ <dig>  mouse h2-ab from genbank id: ay_ <dig> and ndv f gene from genbank id: ay_ <dig>  the reconstructed vectors were used for clsm , for ip , for wb , for expression as immunization antigens or for expression as coating antigen in elisa .

ii-segments in hybrids bound to non-pbr of mhc class ii molecules
complexes involving mhc ii α, β and ii  at the cell surface 
 <cit>  resulted from binding with hybrids containing different ii-segments. we carried out immunoprecipitation and western blotting to establish how ii segments in the hybrids bound to mhc class ii molecules. the results indicated that the full-length ii and the ii/f <dig> hybrid bound mhc ii β chain strongly  . another hybrid containing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains  also bound mhc class ii molecules , and the hybrids containing cytosolic domain  or containing only ii-key and dn   failed to bind mhc class ii molecules. these results indicated that besides the trimerization region, the other segments, such as the cytosolic and transmembrane domains together , had a role in binding to mhc class ii molecules. because ii or ii hybrids bind to the mhc ii molecule, ii clip region or the epitope f <dig> in the ii hybrids loaded in the pbr, ii functional segments might bind non-pbrs of mhc ii molecules. 

some ii segments co-localized with mhc class ii molecules on the plasma membrane
to determine where in the cells the segments bind mhc class ii α or β chains, we cotransfected cos <dig> cells with these segments or hybrids as well as h2-aa or h2-ab. mhc ii α or β chains , full-length ii  and cyt/tm/ii-key/clip/nd  were expressed on the plasma membrane in the transfected cos <dig> cells, but the ii-segments, cyt/ii-key/clip/dn  were not expressed. the complete co-localization of full-length ii and ii/f <dig> hybrid with mhc ii α or β chain on the plasma membrane resulted in the appearance of a uniform range or yellow-orange accumulation in the merged images . it depended on molecular integrity, because full-length ii and ii/f <dig> hybrid contained the cytosolic and transmembrane domains for membrane localization and the trimerization region for polymerization. in the presence of cytosolic and transmembrane domains, however, the ii-segments  and ii-segment/epitope hybrid  resulted in partial co-localization with mhc ii α or β chain, which was consistent with the imaging results observed in figure 
3d and f. all the other ii-segments and hybrids, which lacked the transmembrane domain and trimerization region, such as cyt/ii-key/clip/nd, ii-key, ii-key/clip, ii-key/clip/dn  and cyt/ii-key/f306/nd, did not bind to mhc ii molecules , even if they were localized in the cytosol   or cell membrane  . the differences in the merged images  hypothetically resulted from the degree of tight binding of the hybrids with mhc class ii molecules.

all the ii-segments increased immune response
to establish whether ii-segments, which bound and co-localized with mhc class ii molecules, improved immune response, we immunized mice with these hybrids, including f <dig> alone, and measured the specific antibody levels. as illustrated in figure 
 <dig>  we detected an antibody titer of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> using elisa in mice immunized with f <dig> alone. the ii-key/f <dig> or ii-key/f306/dn hybrids induced antibody titers approximately 2-fold  or 4-fold  higher, respectively, compared with f <dig> alone. moreover, the hybrids containing the cytosolic and transmembrane domains, cyt/tm/ii-key/f <dig> or cyt/tm/ii-key/f306/dn, elicited up to approximately 9-fold higher antibody titer  than f <dig> alone. however, the ii/f <dig> hybrid induced an antibody titer approximately 3-fold  higher compared with f <dig> alone. these results suggested that, except for the trimerization region, the tested ii-segments played a role in boosting the immune response in different ways, affecting the non-pbr of mhc class ii molecules and immune cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and western blotting that ii segment cytosolic and transmembrane domains bound to mhc class ii molecules, and by confocal microscopy that they co-localized on the plasma membrane with mhc class ii molecules in transfected cells. although the amino acid sequences lying outside the n and c terminal segments of clip, ii-key and dn, neither bound to nor co-localized with mhc class ii molecules, the both segments made the epitope in the hybrids concomitantly more stable when associated with a pbr .

together with the cytosolic and transmembrane domains, these amino acid sequences associate with the non-pbr of mhc class ii molecules to form complexes, hybrid/mhc ii, which might be better for presenting epitopes to immune cells, improving specific antibody production.

discussion
ii-key and dn facilitate epitope loading in mhc ii pbr
the conformation of the mhc class ii molecules plays an important role in peptide association 
 <cit> . binding of peptide to mhc class ii molecules involves several conformational changes, including a transient “peptide-receptive” conformation 
 <cit> . the efficient generation of long-lived peptide/class ii complexes involves two stages: initial conditioning of mhc class ii molecules in an acidic environment, forming a floppy mhc that increases the ability of class ii molecules to enter a compact conformation, upon binding to specific peptides 
 <cit> ; whereas the mature peptide-loaded mhc class ii molecules appear as compact heterodimers 
 <cit> . ii-key and dn lie just outside n and c termini of the clip region, respectively. ii-key facilitates epitope loading of mhc class ii molecules at the cell surface 
 <cit> . dn, two relatively conserved residues and hypothetically similar to ii-key, help clip bind to the mhc class ii pbr, enabling effective and stable epitope  loading of the pbr. furthermore, the mhc class ii molecules exist in at least two different conformations with respect to their peptide-binding ability; one more receptive to binding than the other 
 <cit> . the peptide may configure a class ii mhc structure 
 <cit> , resulting in a compact conformation facilitating charging of epitopes 
 <cit> . ii-key and dn possibly enhance the loading stability of ii-key/f <dig> or ii-key/f306/dn with mhc class ii pbr, to induce a conformational change in the trough and facilitate effective epitope charging 
 <cit>  and generation of long-lived peptide/class ii complexes 
 <cit> , affecting t cell secretion of ifn and increased humoral immune response 
 <cit> . however, the affinity between ii-key and dn, and mhc class ii molecule is not sufficient to form complexes in cotransfected cells or immunoprecipitation .

cytosolic and transmembrane domain binding to non-pbr improves epitope loading in mhc class ii pbr
the ii and the ii-segment/f <dig> hybrids bind mhc class ii α or β chains as complexes on the plasma membrane , based on their trimerization region. the cyt/tm/ii-key/f306/dn lacks the trimerization region, although it also binds mhc class ii molecules to form visible complexes . the transmembrane domain has a role in the formation of αβ/ii trimers 
 <cit> : along with ii-key and dn, it is the third factor for binding to mhc class ii molecules and maintaining stability of epitope/mhc ii complexes. however, this domain also co-localizes to the membrane with mhc class ii molecules. the mhc class ii molecules require localization on the membrane rafts for signal transduction 
 <cit> . a preferential localization of peptide-bound mhc class ii molecules on the membrane results in optimal antigen presentation 
 <cit> . in addition, the cytosolic domain contains an endosome-targeting signal for immune regulation 
 <cit> . the binding of the non-pbr via ii functional segments, co-localization with mhc ii on the membrane, and signal transduction are sufficient for stable complex formation, antigen presentation and initial immune response.

ii-segments are a potential immune carrier
the ii/f <dig> hybrid bound mhc class ii molecules strongly to form complexes on the plasma membrane . it stimulated an intermediate immune response, which was lower than that of other hybrids containing cytosolic and transmembrane domains . under normal conditions, the mhcii/ii complex is directed to endosomes 
 <cit>  and then to immature lysosomes, where the ii is proteolyzed 
 <cit> , and the clip is replaced by an antigenic peptide 
 <cit> . the ii/f <dig> hybrid contains a trimerization region at its c terminus, which enables the ii hybrid/mhc ii molecule to form stable complexes. however, tight binding between mhc class ii molecules and ii/f <dig> hybrid might prevent ii/f <dig> hybrid release to bind other mhc class ii molecules and activate other immune cells. in other words, the trimerization region disrupts contact with receptors at other cell surfaces, which is necessary for initiation of the immune response when mhc class ii molecules present antigenic peptide. in contrast to ii/f <dig> hybrid, the other ii-segment/epitope hybrids such as cyt/tm/ii-key/f306/dn bind mhc class ii molecules on the plasma membrane weakly, which is sufficient to form relatively stable complexes to induce an immune response, but also for its disassembly to bind and activate more immune cells. in brief, these ii-segments may be used as a carrier to promote specific immune responses.
