BACKGROUND
immediate detection of an abrupt change in the environment is one of the most important functions of sensory systems. actually, neural networks sensitive to sensory changes are known in humans  <cit> . if a change-detection system operates spontaneously to orient the individual to the new condition, investigating the preattentive activation process in the brain in response to sensory changes can help us to understand the mechanisms of this sensory change-detection system. change-detection process necessitates the comparison of the new event with the preceding condition, and therefore, should involve sensory memory, i.e. the ability to hold sensory information in a readily accessible state temporarily  <cit> . in the auditory system, the mechanism of change-detection and/or its relation to the memory system has been studied using mismatch negativity   <cit>  and change-n <dig>  a subcomponent of n <dig>  <cit> . mmn is an electromagnetic response to a discriminable change in any regular aspect of auditory stimulation, which usually peaks  <dig> to  <dig> ms following the onset of the change. mmn is commonly obtained under a so-called oddball paradigm, in which a deviant stimulus is interspersed among a frequently presented standard stimulus. although mmn is a component of event-related brain potentials, the mismatch response has been recorded also using other methods including magnetoencephalography   <cit> , positron emission tomography  <cit> , functional magnetic resonance imaging  <cit> , optic imaging  <cit> , and intracranial recordings  <cit> . a commonly accepted interpretation of mmn is that it is generated by an automatic change-detection process in which a disconcordance is found between the input from the deviant auditory event and the sensory-memory-representation of the regular aspects of the preceding auditory stimulation  <cit>  . therefore, brain activity in response to sensory changes is expected to be affected by a memory trace of a preceding event , the time between the new and the preceding events , and the degree of physical difference between the two events. in fact, previous studies show that the latency and amplitude of mmn is affected by the interval between the standard and deviant  <cit>  and magnitude of deviance  <cit>  .

change-n <dig>  which is elicited by a sudden change in a continuous tone and peaks approximately  <dig> ms after the onset of the change, has been also used to investigate higher auditory processes  <cit> . the scalp distribution of change-n <dig> differs from that of n <dig> evoked at the onset of the tone, suggesting that the neural populations involved in these responses are at least partially different from one another. although change-n <dig> differs from mmn in that mmn does not contain the n <dig> component, change-n <dig> is also considered to relate to an auditory store  <cit> .

change detection has long been studied in psychophysics using a sensory threshold. weber  <cit>  first pointed out that for the tactile system, the ratio of a just noticeable difference  in intensity to the physical variable being compared  is constant regardless of variations in i. fechner  <cit>  showed that internal, intensive scales can be reconstructed after assuming that the ratio Δi/i represents a unitary value in sensation  and integrated the function Δs = k * Δi/i, which led to the famous, logarithmic law of subjective intensity . although this resulted in great progress in the psychophysic study of the subjective internal world , it remains to be elucidated whether the phenomenon seen using threshold measurements applies to suprathreshold situations  <cit>  or whether this law can be used to scale the magnitude of sensed differences. furthermore, whether these psychological laws hold for brain responses in humans is yet to be clarified.

in this study, we investigated the relationship between cortical responses and the magnitude of differences in various stimulus parameters by using the change-n <dig> component in the auditory system that serves as an indicator of the brain's change-detection system. change-n <dig> was also expected to provide clues about echoic memory that is auditory equivalent of sensory memory. since change detection has been shown to be affected by the timing of the deviant stimulus during the standard-deviant sequence , at first, we changed the interval between the standard and deviant stimuli to examine change detection and echoic memory decay through the change-n <dig> response  and then, changed the duration of the standard stimulus to examine echoic memory storage  using two tones of different sound pressure  under a simple even probability paradigm. in experiment  <dig>  we examined effects of the magnitude of the deviance using changes in repetitive brief tones.

RESULTS
experiment 1
effects of the interval between the standard sound and deviant sound on change-n <dig> were examined by varying the interval between two stimuli from  <dig> to  <dig> ms. results of each experiment are summarized in fig.  <dig>  original and difference waveforms of all the subjects are shown in fig.  <dig>  the deviant sound elicited a clear component at around  <dig> ms following its onset. we refer to this component as change-n <dig> in this paper. the mean peak latency and amplitude of change-n <dig> for each condition are listed in table  <dig>  results show that the amplitude of change-n <dig> decreased as the interval between the standard and deviant stimuli increased. the amplitude was negatively correlated with the logarithm  or power  of the interval for averaged data . in individual subjects, the r <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the logarithmic function or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the power function was clearly larger than that for the linear function . the peak latency of change-n <dig> increased with an increase in the interval with a logarithmic function for the averaged data . however, for individual data, results of the curve fitting usually did not reach a significant level for either the logarithmic , power , exponential , or linear  function.

data are expressed as the mean 

experiment 2
we examined the effects of the duration of the standard sound. the results described above led us to expect that a longer standard sound would increase the memory storage for itself and consequently the deviant sound would evoke a larger change-n <dig>  results were as expected. the amplitude of change-n <dig> as a function of the duration of the standard sound showed a positively accelerated curve . results of the curve fitting of individual data showed that the r <dig> value was largest for the logarithmic function  followed by the power , exponential , and linear  functions. the peak latency tended to decrease with an increase in the duration in all the subjects. however as in experiment  <dig>  the curve fitting in individual subjects was sometimes difficult .

experiment 3
given that several features of a sound can be stored in echoic memory  <cit>  or a long auditory store  <cit>  and the generation of change-n <dig> depends on a memory-comparison between the new event and preceding state, the degree of the physical difference between the standard and deviant sounds should affect the amplitude of change-n <dig>  we tested this using three variables: sound pressure, sound frequency, and sound location. results are shown in figs. 1c and  <dig>  for all three variables tested, the relationship between the amplitude of change-n <dig> and the magnitude of physical differences between the standard and deviant sounds was not linear. in general, the relationship was explained best by the logarithmic function  and worst by the linear function . the latency of change-n <dig> decreased with an increase in the magnitude of the deviance. the r <dig> value of the curve fitting was largest for the exponential  and smallest for the linear  functions. in all three experiments , there was a tendency for the amplitude to follow a logarithmic function and for latency to follow an exponential function.

discussion
the present results suggest that change-n <dig> is a product of an automatic change-detection system that receives auditory information processed in earlier cortical areas and generates change-specific signals proportional to the magnitude of the deviance, at least under the present experimental conditions. results of experiment  <dig> showed that weber-fechner law holds for the automatic cortical response to auditory changes within a suprathreshold range. one weakness of fechner's formulation is that there is no known relationship between the size of a jnd and the rate of growth of subjective magnitude  <cit> . the present results suggest that when the magnitude of a perceived difference is applied to weber's law, weber-fechner law might hold for the magnitude of the perceived differences within a suprathreshold range. that is, the magnitude of the perceived difference would be logarithmically related to the degree of the difference between the two stimuli. although the present study did not provide psychological data, there is a psychophysics study supporting this view  <cit> . in terms of the survival of animals, such a non-linear function would work well within a physiologically significant range of sensory changes. in this regard, a limitation of weber's law, that just noticeable differences are constant only within a certain range of sensory intensities, seems reasonable. when the stimulus or the difference between a new event and the preceding state is strong enough to fully orient to the new event, a further increase in brain activity specific to change detection would be unnecessary.

the results of experiment  <dig>  that a decay of echoic memory has a non-linear function in time, are consistent with psychological studies using a dichotic listening task showing that recall performance decreases with time in a typical negatively accelerated fashion  <cit> . some previous erp and meg studies also showed a decrease in the amplitude of mismatch responses with an increase in the interstimulus interval  <cit> . in addition to this, the present study showed that echoic memory has a non-linear storage function in time. although whether this rule can be applied to other more complicated memory systems is unclear, these results might show one fundamental mechanism of memory. echoic memory shares features with short-term memory or working memory  <cit> . since the present results show that the behavior of echoic memory can be understood through change-n <dig>  change-n <dig> would be a useful tool to investigate memory systems in addition to psychological methods. however, there remains the possibility that the present results reflect more than one form of memory. there are several lines of evidence that support the existence of two different auditory stores, short and long  <cit> . the short form refers to a literal store that decays within one second of a stimulus. for example, psychological studies using auditory persistence paradigms  <cit> , integration phenomena of sound intensity and time  <cit> , and the shift of the auditory threshold  <cit>  showed a short store of  <dig> to  <dig> ms. a long auditory store retains a spectro-temporal structure of sounds over several seconds or more and thus differs from the shorter type by its storage properties and temporal span. psychological studies, for example using auditory modality superiority effects  <cit> , dichotic listening  <cit> , or two-stimulus comparisons  <cit>  have provided data supporting the existence of this type of store. therefore, these two different auditory stores might be involved in the generation of the change-n <dig> component in the present study. there is a possibility that the time course of change-n <dig> in experiments  <dig> and  <dig> comes from two overlapping curves.

the main component of auditory evoked potentials peaking at around  <dig> ms  is known to have several subcomponents . the present study using only one exploring electrode could not clarify the composition of change-n <dig>  however, although the present study did not employ a specific stimulation paradigm, change-n <dig> resembles mmn in several aspects: 1) a frontocentral negative and mastoid-positive field distribution, 2) independence of attention  <cit> , 3) positive relation of the peak amplitude and inverse relation of the peak latency to the magnitude of the difference between the standard and deviant  <cit> , and 4) dependence on the memory trace  <cit> . this suggests that change-n <dig> might contain the mmn component at least in part or these two have a similar, though not identical, generating mechanism. however, as for the amplitude of mmn elicited by sound frequency deviance, horváth et al.  <cit>  found no effects of the magnitude of deviance on it. one possible reason for the discrepancy with the present results is their subtraction method used to obtain mmn. for the control condition, they presented all the deviant stimuli randomly at the same probability under an oddball sequence equal to that used in the standard-deviant condition. then they used the deviant-control difference waveform rather than deviant-standard difference to obtain the 'genuine' mmn, which can eliminate the contribution of the n <dig> component to the difference waveform  <cit> . as we did not use a subtraction procedure, change-n <dig> in the present study could contain the n <dig> component. in a study using meg, lavikainen et al.  <cit>  found that a change in frequency of a continuous tone produced magnetic responses consisting of two separable components, which probably correspond to n <dig> and mmn. therefore, the discrepancy between horváth's findings and the present findings might suggest that the relationship between the amplitude of the response and the magnitude of deviance is due to the change-sensitive n <dig> subcomponent and not mmn.

along with the frequency deviance-elicited mmn  <cit> , schröger's group proposed a method of eliminating possible contamination by n <dig>  <cit>  and obtaining a 'genuine' mmn for studying sound location  <cit>  and sound pressure  <cit>  deviances. this is important because it has been argued that n <dig> and mmn reflect different cognitive processes in audition  <cit>  , while some investigators proposed that mmn is part of a modulated n <dig> response, and therefore, there is no genuine mmn  <cit>  , that is, mmn is the difference between the adapted n <dig> elicited by a standard and non-adapted n <dig> elicited by a deviant . however, as for the long-lasting debate on n <dig> and mmn in general, the present findings neither support nor rule out the adaptation model or memory-based model. this matter is beyond the scope of the present study. studies comparing the 'genuine' mmn and change-n <dig> might help to resolve this issue.

it remains to be clarified whether the gradual change of the response obtained in this study is present in each trial for each subject, or observed due to the averaging across trials and/or due to the different thresholds for the change in different participants while the phenomenon actually responds in an all-or-none manner . in the present study, the curve fitting for the individual subjects was difficult with any model for latency. although it appears that results of analyses of individual data support the idea that both the amplitude and latency of change-n <dig> behave in a non-linear fashion, no definite conclusion was reached regarding the manner of the behavior, for example, logarithmic or exponential like in psychological studies where there are numerous discussions of the model to explain sensory perception  <cit> . as for the possibility that the amplitude of the averaged response across trials is not determined by the amplitude of the response in each trial, atienza et al.  <cit>  showed in a unique study investigating sleep-dependent enhancement that the enhancement of postsleep mmn amplitude was a result of a reduction in the mmn latency jitter rather than an increase in amplitude. this issue remains to be resolved.

it is suggested that mmn could be used to determine the degree of abnormality in auditory perception, attention, and memory, and in fact, previous studies have found an attenuated or delayed mmn in clinical disorders such as schizophrenia  <cit> . we believe that the stimulation paradigm used in this study will improve the method for replicable recordings of the change-related response in individual patients, and in addition, for separate evaluations of discrimination accuracy, memory establishment, and memory decay. since the present results were obtained in only seven subjects whose age varied considerably, normative data should be collected in a study with a larger sample.

CONCLUSIONS
the present findings suggest that temporal representation of echoic memory is non-linear and weber-fechner law holds for the automatic cortical response to sound changes within a suprathreshold range. although whether this rule can be applied to other more complicated memory systems is unclear, these results might show one fundamental mechanism of memory. since the behavior of echoic memory can be understood through change-n <dig>  change-n <dig> would be a useful tool to investigate memory systems.
