BACKGROUND
the roots of medicinal plant lithospermum erythrorhizon can specifically accumulate shikonin and its derivatives which have significant anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antimicrobial activities . these red naphthoquinone pigments are also excellent natural dyes widely used in the industries of fabric, food and cosmetics  <cit> .

in the last decade, the cell or hairy root culture systems of l. erythrorhizon have been successfully used to produce these valuable compounds through a two-stage culture system, i.e.,  l. erythrorhizon cells or hairy roots are cultured in b <dig> multiplication medium under light for fast amplification, and  transferred into m <dig> production medium to produce shikonin pigments in darkness . this excellent system has become a promising tool to better understand the metabolism of shikonin pigments. genes encoding pivotal enzymes or regulators for shikonin biosynthesis, excretion and/or transportation have also been cloned and characterized, such as the l. erythrorhizon phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene   <cit> , the l. erythrorhizon cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase gene   <cit> , the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase gene   <cit> , the l. erythrorhizon p-hydroxybenzoate:geranyltransferase gene  , the l. erythrorhizon pigment callus-specific gene   <cit> , and the l. erythrorhizon dark-inducible gene   <cit> . moreover, several factors, such as light  <cit> , mineral elements  <cit> , fungal elicitor  <cit> , culture medium  <cit> , nitric oxide  <cit> , methyl jasmonate  <cit> , and et  <cit> , have been described to be crucial regulators of shikonin biosynthesis.

ethylene insensitive <dig> /ein3-like proteins  are plant-specific transcription factors which regulate various et responses . ein3/eil <dig> is a key integration node between et and other signals in the complex molecular signaling network  <cit> . by binding to specific promoter elements, ein3/eil <dig> activates or represses the expression of target genes responsible for et signaling, and thus modulates multiple et-related responses of plants, such as those for development, phenotype, and adaptation to environmental stresses . however, the knowledge of the relationship between ein3/eil and plant secondary metabolism remains limited.

in the medicinal plant l. erythrorhizon, et is an important regulator of shikonin biosynthesis  <cit> . furthermore, an optimal concentration of endogenous et was presumed to be pivotal for shikonin formation  <cit> . leeil- <dig>  a homolog of arabidopsis ein <dig>  has been isolated from l. erythrorhizon cells. it was speculated to be important for et-regulated shikonin biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the function of leeil- <dig> in shikonin biosynthesis at the molecular level remains unknown. functional study on leeil- <dig> could be useful for elucidating the relationship among leeil- <dig>  et, and shikonin production.

in this study, two transgenic strategies, overexpression and rna interference , were applied to induce leeil-1-overexpression and leeil-1-rnai transgenic hairy roots. the relationship between the expression pattern of leeil- <dig> and shikonin production was investigated to offer new insights into the understanding of the possible function of leeil- <dig> in shikonin biosynthesis.

RESULTS
hairy root induction, cultivation, and identification
for more detailed understanding of the function of leeil- <dig> in shikonin formation, both rnai and overexpression transgenic strategies were applied in this study. the plasmids of pbi121-leeil-1-overexpression  and pbi121-leeil-1-rnai  were constructed and verified based on the pbi121-enhanced green fluorescent protein gene empty vector   . the agrobacterium rhizogenes strain  <dig>  and the a. rhizogenes  <dig> containing ev, ei or eo plasmid were employed to infect the nodes of aseptic seedlings  <cit> . over  <dig> transgenic lines of hairy root had been successfully induced for each construct  and wt .fig.  <dig> induction, verification, and growth polymorphism observation of four different types of hairy root lines.  structure and restriction maps of the transformation vectors pbi121-egfp , pbi121-leeil-1-rnai , and pbi121-leeil-1-overexpression ;  growth polymorphism of the induced l. erythrorhizon hairy roots by using the method of pricking nodes with a needle. differentiated callus, leaf , and regenerated shoots  from the ei hairy root lines on the stock culture medium;  pcr analysis of the rolc gene in hairy roots. the untransformed l. erythrorhizon seedling was used as the negative control 



for stock culture, all hairy roots  were transferred into b <dig> solid medium  at 26–28 °c under subdued light. the remarkable growth polymorphisms of four types of hairy roots were observed at the infection sites  or in the stock culture medium . eo hairy root lines were displayed obviously red either at the infection sites of seedling nodes or in sub-cultured stock medium under subdued light. no obvious red hairy root lines were observed in wt, ei, and ev. many black segments were observed in most ei. the growth rates of eo and ei were relative slow in comparison with those of wt and ev in the stock culture medium or multiplication culture medium, with ei exhibiting the slowest growth rate . this finding indicated that the growth of l. erythrorhizon hairy roots might be affected by excessively low or high expression level of leeil- <dig>  we also found that callusing and regeneration phenomena easily occurred in the ei cultured in b <dig> medium  compared with other hairy root lines. hence, we speculated that the repressed mrna level of leeil- <dig> changed the development and phenotype of hairy roots to some extent.

to confirm the transformation of hairy roots, the dna samples from all transgenic hairy roots  were used as template for pcr amplification of the tagging rolc gene of a. rhizogenes  <dig>  <cit> , and the dna of untransformed l. erythrorhizon seedling was used as negative control. results showed that the rolc gene was only amplified from wt, ev, ei, and eo hairy roots, , which confirms the success of hairy root transformation of l. erythrorhizon.

confocal scanning laser microscopy analysis was performed on egfp-tagged cells to identify all the hairy roots and clarify the subcellular localization of leeil- <dig>  different patterns of egfp localization were visualized in hairy roots. no fluorescence could be observed in wt hairy roots , whereas uniform and intense signals of fluorescence appeared in the nucleus, cell wall and cytoplasm of ev hairy roots . in ei hairy root lines, only weak fluorescence signal was discerned . in eo hairy root lines, strong signals emitted by egfp were detected predominantly in the nucleus , where ein3/eils localized  <cit> . based on these findings, we speculated that co-expression or co-localization of the fusion protein egfp:leeil- <dig> may occur in the nucleus of eo but may be effectively suppressed in ei hairy roots.fig.  <dig> confocal analyses of egfp in wt , ev , ei , and eo  hairy roots. scale bar =20 μm; excitation wavelength = 488 nm; emission wavelength of egfp = 510 nm



expression patterns of leeil- <dig> in the two-stage culture system
in order to assess the transgenic effects, expression patterns of leeil- <dig> in four types of hairy root were characterized by using real-time pcr method. each five lines of ei and eo cultured in b <dig> medium were randomly selected; each three lines of wt and ev were used as controls. similar transcript levels were observed in three wt hairy root lines . compared with that in wt hairy root lines, leeil- <dig> did not significantly change in ev hairy root lines . however, in ei hairy root lines, leeil- <dig> was significantly down-regulated compared with that in wt or ev . in eo hairy root lines, leeil- <dig> significantly increased  . therefore, the transcript level of leeil- <dig> actually significantly increased in hairy roots of leeil-1-overexpressing and decreased in leeil-1-rnai hairy root lines.fig.  <dig>

we speculated that the transformation of leeil- <dig> genetically influences the biosynthesis of shikonin. shikonin and its derivatives are red specific pigments, and color changes of the pigments in hairy roots as well as in m <dig> medium excreted from hairy roots were detected upon visual inspection  <cit> . time-course analysis was also performed to assess shikonin pigment accumulation in hairy roots of wt, ev, ei, and eo through visual inspection. no pigment was observed in b <dig> multiplication medium under light . the red color significantly changed when transferred hairy roots from b <dig> multiplication medium into m <dig> production medium for 1– <dig> days, reached the highest levels at 6– <dig> days, and exhibited minimal changes thereafter, with the highest yield found in eo and the lowest level in ei from  <dig> to 9 days . the time course accumulation analyses of shikonin in different types of hairy roots were performed using the randomly selected four typical lines, i.e., wt- <dig>  ev- <dig>  ei- <dig> and eo- <dig>  from  <dig> to 6 days, the concentration of shikonin in hairy roots above increased rapidly, and then reached to a relative high level at the time point of 6 days. thereafter, the content of shikonin in different hairy roots began to accumulate in different patterns. significantly enhanced content of shikonin was observed in eo- <dig>  while dramatically reduced in ei- <dig> in comparison with that in ev- <dig> or wt- <dig> at each time point of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 days  .

based on the time-course analysis of shikonin formation, each three lines of wt, ev, ei, and eo were selected and transferred from b <dig> multiplication medium into m <dig> production medium for the expression patterns analysis of leeil- <dig>  dynamic expression patterns of leeil- <dig> in the m <dig> production medium  were detected, similar to the expression pattern of leeil- <dig> in l. erythrorhizon callus cells in our previous report  <cit> . remarkable changes occurred when transferred hairy roots of wt, ev, ei, and eo from b <dig> multiplication medium into m <dig> production medium for 9 days. the mrna level of leeil- <dig> in each three lines of wt, ev, ei, and eo reduced dramatically at 12 h, increased at 1 day in most hairy root lines, constantly declined, and then reached the lowest level at 5 days.

the transcript levels of leeil- <dig> significantly exhibited varied increase rates in each type of hairy roots cultured in m <dig> from  <dig> to 9 days . in hairy roots of wt, ev, and ei, the leeil- <dig> transcripts presented a rapid increase from  <dig> to 6 days, and then continually increased for 6– <dig> days. the leeil- <dig> transcript level in eo hairy root lines, however, slightly reduced from  <dig> to 9 days and maintained a relatively high level compared with those in wt, ev, and ei hairy root lines at 9 days. consistent with the visual inspection results on shikonin production in m <dig> medium, the highest leeil- <dig> transcript level was found in eo lines, the lowest level in ei lines, and the medium level in ev or wt lines from  <dig> to 9 days . it is obviously, the sixth day in the m <dig> medium is the important time point at which the expression level of leeil- <dig> in different hairy roots should be compared. this result indicated that leeil- <dig> expression might be concurrent with the accumulation of shikonin and its derivatives.

interestingly, we noticed that leeil- <dig> was down-regulated at the early stage within 5 days no matter it was located downstream of camv-35s promoter or not. in the two-stage culture system, the antibiotic- and hormone-free b <dig> medium was used as the growth medium for multiplying hairy roots under constant light condition, whereas the hormone-containing m <dig> medium was employed for hairy roots to produce shikonin and its derivatives under continuous dark culture condition. we speculated that the dramatic differences  between these two stages might affect the expression of leeil- <dig> at the early stage when transferred l. erythrorhizon hairy roots from b <dig> multiplication medium into m <dig> production medium.

since shikonin is biosynthesized in the dark, we also detected the effect of light signal on the expression pattern of leeil- <dig>  the wt- <dig> hairy root line was randomly selected and pre-cultured in b <dig> for 2 days under constant light condition. similar to the expression pattern of leerf- <dig>  which is another et response factor reported in our previous study  <cit> , leeil- <dig> was induced by dark . this result was also consistent with the dark-induced mrna levels of ein <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> .

leeil- <dig> is a positive regulator of shikonin production
based on the above results, we speculated that leeil- <dig> positively mediates et-regulated shikonin biosynthesis. to validate the speculation, we performed the relationship analysis between the expression level of leeil- <dig>  and the shikonin contents  in various hairy roots in m <dig> production medium for 6 days. in addition, as for different hairy root types , only the expression levels of leeil- <dig> affected by rnai or overexpresison were different; all other factors, including m <dig> medium, culture condition , were same for them in the research system.fig.  <dig>

the results showed that both the leeil- <dig> expression levels and shikonin production were significantly increased in eo hairy root lines, but dramatically declined in ei in comparison with those in wt or ev control lines  . thus, a significantly positive linear correlation between shikonin content and leeil- <dig> expression level was deduced based on the results of all lines detected above  . furthermore, a number of high-yield shikonin hairy roots had been obtained from eo , suggesting the strategy of leeil-1-overexpression has great potential to obtain hairy roots with high-yield shikonin production.

leeil- <dig> confers shikonin production by regulating the expression of key genes for shikonin biosynthesis
as ein3/eils act as key positive regulators at the most downstream of et signaling transduction pathway  <cit> , we deduced that the expression of leeil- <dig> is possibly associated with the downstream target genes which regulate shikonin formation. further research on genes involved in et signaling transduction pathway and shikonin biosynthesis pathway under the mechanism of overexpression and rnai of leeil- <dig> will bridge the gap between shikonin production and accumulation of leeil- <dig> transcripts.

since there was no difference for shikonin production and expression level of leeil- <dig> between ev and wt, and to avoid the transgenic effects of plasmid, three pbi <dig> vector containing lines  cultured in m <dig> for 6 days were selected for further analyses of the expression of several key genes implicated in shikonin biosynthesis. these genes include the speculated downstream gene of leeil- <dig> , the key genes involved in biosynthetic pathway of shikonin  , and the genes possibly responsible for the transportation, stabilization and/or excretion of shikonin pigments .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of shikonin biosynthesis-related genes regulated by leeil- <dig>   the metabolic pathway outline for the biosynthesis of shikonin and its derivatives. the genes encoding crucial enzymes of this pathway are marked in bold and italic fonts;  transcript levels of the key shikonin biosynthesis-related gene in ev, ei, and eo hairy root lines cultured in m <dig> medium for 6 days. a representative example from two biological experiments is shown; the values are means ± sd  and the bars with different capital letters indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  



the expression level of leerf- <dig> was significantly up-regulated in eo- <dig> but down-regulated in ei- <dig> compared with that in the ev- <dig> control . similarly, leeil- <dig> overexpression significantly up-regulated the mrna accumulation of lepal, lepgt- <dig>  lec4h- <dig>  leps- <dig>  le4cl- <dig>  ledi- <dig> and hmgr in eo hairy root line . by contrast, rnai-mediated knockdown of leeil- <dig> in ei hairy roots significantly suppressed the expression of all genes, especially ledi- <dig>  . we speculated that the up- or down-regulated transcripts of leeil- <dig> in turn altered the transcription of most genes in the biosynthetic pathway of shikonin. in the hairy roots cultured in m <dig>  expression patterns of these shikonin biosynthesis-related genes  matched to the expression pattern of leeil- <dig>  as well as shikonin production at the time point of 6 days . this observation indicated that these shikonin biosynthesis-related genes were induced by leeil- <dig> and might be involved in the leeil-1-regulated shikonin production.

ledi- <dig> gene does not participate in the biosynthesis of shikonin, however, it possibly functions in the stabilization and/or transport of shikonin  <cit> . leps- <dig> is possibly a key gene functioning in the trapping and/or intra-cell wall excretion of shikonin pigments  <cit> . these studies collectively indicated that the regulation of leeil- <dig> in shikonin accumulation possibly also includes the event of excretion, stabilization, and/or transportation of shikonin and its derivatives after biosynthesis. hence, a certain cooperative relationship is necessary between leeil- <dig> and genes participating in shikonin biosynthesis in l. erythrorhizon.

taken together, leeil- <dig> confers shikonin production through the regulation of key genes participating in shikonin biosynthesis.

discussion
leeil- <dig> is a pivotal target gene contributing to efficient shikonin formation
in the signaling network of plant, ein3/eil <dig> acts as a key integration node between et and other signals  <cit> . ein3/eil <dig> activates the expression of downstream genes, in which erfs are the typical ones  <cit> . erfs then bind to the gcc box cis-elements of many genes regulated by et, and function positively by activating et responses  <cit> .

in the medicinal plant l. erythrorhizon, shikonin and its derivatives are specifically accumulated in the dark but are suppressed under white or blue light condition. consistent with the mrna level of dark-inducible genes leerf- <dig>  <cit>  and ledi- <dig>  <cit> , leeil- <dig> was also up-regulated in the dark. this finding indicated that light signal acts as a pivotal regulator of leeil- <dig> during the process of shikonin biosynthesis.

as the first precursor for shikonin biosynthesis, p-hydroxybenzoic acid  is synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway. phb is regulated by sequential enzymes, namely, pal, c4h, and 4cl  <cit> . the other precursor is geranyl pyrophosphate , which is synthesized in the isoprenoid pathway catalyzed by hmgr  <cit> . the formation of m-geranyl-phydroxybenzoic acid  is the pivotal step of shikonin formation. in this process, the substrates phb and gpp were catalyzed by lepgt to form gba, thereby synthesizing shikonin pigmens in l. erythrorhizon  <cit>  . in this study, leeil- <dig> overexpression enhanced the expression of the downstream gene of leeil- <dig>  and a subset of key genes related to shikonin biosynthesis, excretion and/or transportation and stabilization  , and thus increased shikonin accumulation. conversely, rnai of leeil- <dig> effectively decreased shikonin accumulation and down-regulated the above genes. herein, we speculate that both the isoprenoid pathway and the phenylpropanoid pathway for shikonin biosynthesis were regulated by leeil- <dig>  but further direct evidences should be provided in future studies. moreover, the regulatory process also includes the transportation and/or excretion and stabilization of shikonin and its derivatives after formation. in a word, leeil- <dig> is one of the most important contributors possibly in the et-regulated shikonin biosynthesis in l. erythrorhizon.

although the up-regulated transcripts of some ein3/eil members contribute to constitutive et responses, exogenous et can not affect the ein3/eil mrna levels  <cit> ; nevertheless, the abundance of the ein3/eil protein considerably increased upon et exposure because of the strong stabilization of this protein  <cit> . the accumulation of ein3/eil protein is primarily regulated at post-transcriptional level in vivo, and ein <dig> is essential in regulating et-induced ein3/eil <dig>  <cit> . based on the results of previous and present studies, we propose a model for describing the leeil-1-regulated shikonin production possibly in the et signaling cascade ; in this model, which is similar to that described by li et al. , dark-induced leeil- <dig> acts as a positive regulator in et-regulated shikonin formation. therefore, hairy roots with high-yield of shikonin could be obtained by using the leeil-1-overexpression strategy .fig.  <dig> a proposed model illustrates the function of ein3/eil- <dig> in regulating shikonin production. the dotted lines represent regulatory steps, in which a direct physical link between upstream and downstream components has yet to be demonstrated



leeil- <dig> is a possible integration node between et and other signal molecules
in arabidopsis, ein <dig> and its close homolog eil <dig> regulate myriad et responses  <cit> . in the life cycle of plant, ein3/eil <dig> acts as a regulator of et signaling as well as myriad processes, such as the development and stress responses  <cit> , plant immunity defenses  <cit> , and crosstalk between et and jasmonate  <cit> . moreover, ein3/eil <dig> is also involved in plant morphological phenotype changes  <cit> , the de-etiolation of seedlings, and leaf senescence  <cit> .

in this study, the polymorphism and growth rate of hairy roots changed under the condition of either leeil-1-overexpression or leeil-1-rnai . meanwhile, callusing, differentiation and regeneration phenomena easily occurred in ei hairy root lines cultured in b <dig> solid or liquid medium , compared with that in other hairy root lines cultured under the same condition. thus, we speculate that leeil- <dig> possibly regulates other inputs or et specific effectors in multiple layers in the et signaling cascade, thereby inducing the cascade of et responses for cell development, differentiation, and regeneration. it will thus be interesting to investigate whether leeil- <dig> acts as one of the convergence points between et and other signal molecules in the complex network of et transduction pathway in l. erythrorhizon.

CONCLUSIONS
although the biosynthetic pathway of shikonin and its derivatives has been basically well-characterized, the molecular mechanism and key target regulators of shikonin formation are largely unknown. in the present study, by using an excellent two-stage hairy root culture system as the basal condition for shikonin production, we provided evidences for the positive role of leeil- <dig> in regulating shikonin formation. in hairy root lines of eo, leeil-1-overexpressing significantly enhanced shikonin content in comparison with that in ei, as well as the control lines of wt or ev under the same culture conditions. our findings paved the way for future work aiming at extending our knowledge of the molecular regulatory mechanism of et in shikonin biosynthesis. furthermore, we offered a key target gene which has great potential for efficient shikonin biosynthesis in genetic engineering of l. erythrorhizon. future studies focusing on the direct function of leeil- <dig> or other leeils in the et signaling transduction pathway in l. erythrorhizon will give more evidences for the regulation of ethylene on shikonin biosynthesis.
