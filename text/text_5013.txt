BACKGROUND
the genus yersinia, a highly heterogenous organism is currently represented by eleven known species  <cit> . y. pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica are very well documented human pathogens. y. pestis is the etiologic agent of plague  while the other two are known to cause a variety of gastrointestinal syndromes  <cit> . the remaining eight species namely y. intermedia, y. frederiksenii, y. kristensenii, y. bercovieri, y. mollaretii, y. aldovae, y. rohdei and y. ruckeri have generally been termed as "y. enterocolitica-like" species though each is a distinct species. although most commonly isolated from sources like fresh water and food, these have only been infrequently recovered from human clinical specimens  <cit> . but, some of these, especially y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii may constitute as much as 18–32% of all yersinia isolated from stools of diarrheic patients  <cit> . however, not much information is available about these, and sulakvelidze termed them as the ignored species  <cit> . nevertheless, y. intermedia  <cit> , y. frederiksenii  <cit> , y. bercovieri  <cit>  and y. kristensenii  <cit>  have been strongly implicated in cases of diarrhoea. it is therefore important to know more about these species to understand their public health significance.

the production of β-lactamases is an important mechanism of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. in y. enterocolitica, the distribution and production of β-lactamases namely bla-a  and bla-b  has been studied widely and reported to vary with biovars and geographical origin of the strains  <cit> . however, not much is known about the β-lactamases of other important species like y. intermedia, y. frederiksenii and y. kristensenii. recently, y. intermedia, y. frederiksenii, and some strains of y. kristensenii and y. rohdei were reported to produce two β-lactamases  <cit> . on the other hand, y. bercovieri and y. mollaretii have been reported to produce only ampc β-lactamase, while y. aldovae and y. ruckeri showed either low levels of ampc or no expression of β-lactamases at all  <cit> . this information has been inferred from mic data of β-lactam antibiotics. schiefer et al  <cit>  recently characterized β-lactamases of y. frederiksenii, y. bercovieri, y. aldovae and y. ruckeri and reported that except for y. frederiksenii, all expressed only an ampc β-lactamase. mammeri et al  <cit>  cloned and sequenced the complete ampc gene of y. ruckeri and found that it shared low level of identity with the known chromosomal and plasmid ampc enzymes of closely related members, viz., enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes and citrobacter freundii. much of these data however pertains to strains isolated in europe. it would be worthwhile to study the β-lactamases and bla genes of strains isolated from other parts of the world to understand the global drug resistance of yersiniae. no data is available on β-lactamases of "y. enterocolitica-like" species isolated from asian region. therefore, the objective of this work was to detect and characterize the β-lactamases and bla genes of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii isolated from clinical and non-clinical sources in india.

RESULTS
phenotypic detection of bla-a and bla-b enzymes
all the clinical and non-clinical isolates of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii showed presence of bla-a as indicated by the appearance of a small zone of inhibition of 2– <dig> mm radii  around ticarcillin  <dig> μg disc . however, synergy, the appearance of a characteristic additional zone of inhibition between ticarcillin and the adjacent clavulanate disc, was detected in only 26%  of the isolates of y. intermedia and one isolate of y. frederiksenii. in an earlier study, similar observations regarding synergy were made for strains of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a  <cit> . in the present study, bla-b, the inducible cephalosporinase, was detected unequivocally based on the characteristic flattening of inhibition zone around cefotaxime disc adjacent to the imipenem disc in all the strains . tzelepi et al  <cit>  also reported detection of a broad spectrum penicillinase  and an inducible cephalosporinase  in all the thirty aquatic isolates of y. intermedia. our study extends this information further to indicate that bla-a was also present in y. intermedia isolated from clinical and non-clinical  sources. in addition, the present study also showed unequivocal presence of bla-a and bla-b in strains of y. frederiksenii, which was inferred earlier on the basis of mic data only  <cit> .

for bla-a, a larger zone of inhibition  around ticarcillin disc  was observed for wastewater isolates of y. intermedia compared to that of clinical  isolates. the zone of inhibition  around y. intermedia was nevertheless larger compared to that around the strains of y. frederiksenii . also, synergy i.e., appearance of an additional zone of inhibition around ticarcillin disc, was observed in the clinical isolates only. as these phenomena are highly dependent on the degree of the expression of enzyme, these observations suggested differential expression of bla-a as reported earlier for strains of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a  <cit> .

minimum inhibitory concentration 
all the strains were resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins tested. when analyzed separately, no difference was observed in the antibiotic susceptibilities of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii. thus, the combined results are shown in table  <dig>  the mic <dig> of amoxicillin was  <dig> mg/l for the clinical and  <dig> mg/l for the non-clinical strains, whereas mic <dig> was  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> mg/l, respectively. for co-amoxiclav, the mic <dig> ranged from 128– <dig> mg/l and mic <dig> was 256– <dig> mg/l for both clinical and non-clinical strains. the strains were equally resistant to cephalosporins. amongst these, minimum resistance  was seen against cefotaxime for strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii. for ceftazidime, the mic <dig> and mic <dig> were  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> mg/l respectively, and for cefepime, the values ranged from 256– <dig> mg/l. contrary to these, relatively lower mics of penicillins and cephalosporins have been reported for y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii isolated in other parts of the world  <cit> . this may be due to difference in the sources from which organisms were isolated or their geographical origin. interestingly, tzelepi et al  <cit>  found that the strains of y. intermedia isolated in europe were sensitive to both cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the antibiotic resistance data of strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii was in accordance with the preliminary reports from our laboratory earlier  <cit> .

pcr amplification and restriction digestion of blaa gene
the β-lactamase genes namely the blaa and blab were detected by pcr amplification and found to be present in all strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii.

initially, an attempt was made to amplify blaa using published primers  of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a  <cit> . however, though some of the strains of y. intermedia yielded expected amplicon, none of the y. frederiksenii strains gave any amplicon. this may be attributed to differences in the gene sequences of blaa of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii compared to that of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a. thus, to amplify blaa of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii, new internal primers  were designed. when these primers were used for amplification of blaa, the expected  <dig> bp amplicon was obtained for all the forty-nine strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii.

restriction digestion of blaa with ncii revealed that a single site for ncii was present in blaa of only a few strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii as either an uncut dna or two fragments of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp were obtained . however, restriction with haeiii gave three types of patterns having molecular weights  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp , and  <dig> and  <dig> bp , for both y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii. the phylogenetic relationship and genetic heterogeneity in blaa was studied by constructing a concatenated dendrogram  of the ncii and haeiii restriction profiles. the strains of y. intermedia grouped into three major clusters: a, b and c. cluster a was formed by three wastewater isolates . cluster b was most heterogenous comprising clinical, wastewater and pig throat isolates while the cluster c was represented predominantly by pig throat isolates . the clusters b and c were divided further into two subclusters each. the blaa-rflp grouped strains of y. frederiksenii into two major clusters – a and b . except for one, all the strains of clinical origin belonged to cluster b. as observed for y. intermedia, the strains of y. frederiksenii isolated from pig throat also clustered separately into subgroup bii . earlier, work from our laboratory reported that some clinical and non-clinical strains of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a formed separate clusters based on blaa-rflp  <cit> .

several reports indicate that genetic background of antibiotic resistance genes influence antibiotic susceptibility profiles  <cit> . however, no such unequivocal relationship between blaa-rflp type and antibiotic susceptibility was observed in this study. the present work however, clearly revealed heterogeneity in blaa gene of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii, which may account for differential expression of bla-a enzyme as seen in double disc diffusion method. nevertheless, the heterogeneity was only limited as observed earlier for blaa gene of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a strains  <cit> . in moraxella catarrhalis, the two class a β-lactamase genes namely bro- <dig> and bro- <dig>  have been reported to give different restriction profiles with bcgi  <cit> .

pcr amplification and restriction digestion of blab gene
pcr amplification of blab gene resulted in  <dig> bp product for all the forty-nine strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii. the restriction digestion of blab of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii with haeiii gave two types of patterns i.e.,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp . with rsai, except for the three wastewater isolates of y. intermedia , all strains of both the species showed identical pattern, with fragment sizes of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. the concatenated dendrogram of blab-rflp grouped the strains of y. intermedia into three major clusters: a, b and c. as with blaa, except for the three wastewater isolates , all the clinical and majority of the wastewater isolates grouped together in cluster b, whereas group c consisted exclusively of pig throat isolates  . cluster analysis of restriction profiles of y. frederiksenii revealed that except for two, all clinical and pig throat strains grouped together in one major cluster . in a previous study, when the same restriction enzymes  were used, no heterogeneity was discerned in blab gene of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a  <cit> . this suggested that blab gene of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii was more heterogenous compared to that of y. enterocolitica.

sequencing of bla genes
the blaa gene sequence of y. intermedia showed high degree of identity with y. enterocolitica biovar 1a   <cit> , y. enterocolitica  <dig> biovar 1b  and y. enterocolitica y- <dig> biovar  <dig>   <cit> . the identity of blaa of y. frederiksenii with that of the above-mentioned organisms was however found to be 77%,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, suggesting a distinct lineage of y. frederiksenii. the sequence identity of blaa gene of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii with other members of the family enterobacteriaceae namely klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri was comparatively very low and ranged from 48–50% for y. intermedia and 62–63% for y. frederiksenii. furthermore, identity of blaa of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii with burkholderia cepacia, a non-enterobacterial species was  <dig> % and 60%, respectively.

the deduced amino acid sequences of bla-a of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii were analyzed to check similarity in β-lactamases at protein level . the sxxk tetrad, characteristic of β-lactamases possessing a serine active site, was present at position 70– <dig>  <cit> . in addition, two structural motifs characteristic of class a β-lactamases, were also found to be present in bla-a of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii: sdn at position 130– <dig> and ktg at position 234– <dig> along with the motif responsible for omega  loop formation, i.e.,  <dig>  the amino acid sequence alignment revealed high degree of identity  of bla-a of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii with that of y. enterocolitica biovars 1a, 1b and  <dig>  the percent identity of bla-a of y. frederiksenii with k. oxytoca and c. koseri was found to be higher  compared to that of y. intermedia . overall, the data suggested that class a β-lactamase of y. intermedia shared high identity with y. enterocolitica, and that of y. frederiksenii with other members of the family enterobacteriaceae and b. cepacia. this seems to reiterate the distinct lineage of y. frederiksenii as suggested by other investigators based on 16s rdna and gyrase b genes sequence analyses  <cit> .

the nucleotide sequences of blab of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii were found to have 85% identity with that of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a, y. enterocolitica  <dig> biovar 1b and y. enterocolitica ip <dig> biovar  <dig>  and 77% with y. bercovieri. but it was only 50–55% with y. aldovae and y. ruckeri. the deduced amino acid sequence similarity of bla-b of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii with y. enterocolitica biovars 1a, 1b and  <dig> ranged from 89–92%. the comparison of these sequences with that of other "y. enterocolitica-like" species such as y. bercovieri, y. aldovae and y. ruckeri showed percent identity of 80%, 53% and 49% respectively. thus, the phylogenetic relationships as discerned by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  <cit>  were reiterated in antibiotic resistance genes, both at the nucleotide and the protein level. the deduced amino acid sequence of bla-b also revealed presence of the three characteristic motifs viz., 64sxxs <dig>  150yan <dig> and 314ktg <dig> .

molecular weight determination of bla-a and bla-b
molecular weight determination on sds-page showed two distinct bands of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda for all strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii. the band at  <dig> kda was characteristic of bla-a enzyme, as the molecular weight of most class a β-lactamases from other organisms namely y. enterocolitica  <cit> , burkholderia pseudomallei  <cit>  and citrobacter sedlakii  <cit>  has been reported to vary between 29– <dig> kda. the identity of this band was also confirmed by specific inhibition with clavulanic acid. the band at  <dig> kda corresponded to bla-b  as indicated by its specific inhibition with aztreonam. the molecular weight of inducible cephalosporinases or ampc of other species namely y. enterocolitica  <cit> , y. aldovae, y. bercovieri, y. ruckeri and y. frederiksenii  <cit> , and serratia marcescens  <cit> , has however been reported to be in the range of 34– <dig> kda. the  <dig> kda as found in the present study was similar to  <dig> kda ampc of vibrio fischeri  <cit>  and y. enterocolitica biovar 1a  <cit> . since most studies cited above used sds-page to determine the molecular weight, the differences cannot be attributed to methodology.

isoelectric focusing analysis of bla-a and bla-b
isoelectric focusing of β-lactamases of fifteen strains  revealed a single band in the alkaline region of the gel at pi  <dig>   that corresponded to bla-a as indicated by its inhibition by clavulanic acid. tzelepi et al  <cit>  reported that bla-a of y. intermedia focused at pis  <dig> – <dig> . the bla-a of y. enterocolitica with pi  <dig>  has been reported by several investigators  <cit> .

the inducible cephalosporinase or ampc β-lactamase focused as multiple bands in the acidic region of the gel at various pi values. the identity of these bands was confirmed both by induction with imipenem that made the bands more prominent, and also by specific inhibition with aztreonam. two major bands in acidic region of the gel at pi  <dig>  and  <dig>  were observed for the clinical strains of y. intermedia. the ampc of non-clinical strains of y. intermedia focused at pi ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . two additional bands  were observed in the pig throat strains. the only report on bla-b  of y. intermedia reported pi to be between  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . the bla-b of all the strains of y. frederiksenii also appeared as multiple bands at pi  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the strains of y. enterocolitica, for which most information is available in literature  <cit> , produced bla-b with pi  <dig> – <dig>  except biovar 1a strains, the bla-b of which focused at pi  <dig>  and  <dig> . consequently, the bla-b of biovar 1a strains has been termed as "bla-b like"  <cit> . the present study indicated that, like biovar 1a strains, y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii too produced "bla-b like" enzyme.

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
the nucleotide sequence data of blaa and blab has been submitted to ncbi genbank under accession numbers , and  respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
the two β-lactamases namely bla-a and bla-b were detected in all clinical and non-clinical strains of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii isolated from india. differential expression of bla-a but not bla-b was observed by double disc diffusion method. both y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii were highly resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. pcr-rflp revealed that blaa and blab genes of both y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii were heterogeneous. phylogenetic relationships also showed that the two species shared high degree of identity in their bla genes. isoelectric focusing data revealed that both y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii produced bla-a and "bla-b like" enzymes. this is the first study in which β-lactamases  and β-lactamase genes  of y. intermedia and y. frederiksenii isolated from asian region have been investigated.
