BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of small non-coding rnas that function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression by mediating translational inhibition or mrna degradation. mirna bind to "seed" sites, i.e. stretches of 6- <dig> nucleotides in the 3' untranslated region  of their target mrnas. mirnas regulate various cellular processes and appear to be involved in the development of many diseases.

most approaches for mirna target identification rely on either one or a combination of seed matching, site accessibility and phylogenetic conservation  <cit> . in addition, some have incorporated target site location, multiple target sites and expression profiling  <cit> . a number of target prediction methods use expression profiling of both mirna and mrna expressions  <cit> . most of the approaches are based on negative correlation, i.e. reciprocal expressions of mirnas and their degraded target mrnas.

high-dimensional biological data, such as microarray profiling data, are often interpreted as being composed of sets of transcriptional- or activity programs that explain some, or most, of the complexity in the data  <cit> . various methods are being applied on profiling data e.g. principal component analysis  and clustering. in the last couple of years independent component analysis  has been extensively applied on mrna profiling data and recently, ica was applied on mirna profiling data as well  <cit> .

ica is a computational method for separating mixed independent signals and can be used to decompose the expression matrix into independent components  <cit> . this decomposition has been shown to be informative in several studies  <cit> , and superior to clustering and pca  <cit> . apparently, the representation of gene expression as a mix of independent, possibly overlapping, transcriptional programs captures the differential regulation of well-defined biological processes and metabolic pathways  <cit> .

type  <dig> diabetes  is an immune-mediated disease characterized by insulin deficiency due to a specific destruction of the pancreatic β-cells. pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in the destruction through induction of apoptosis  <cit> . the endocrine cells in the pancreatic islets all arise from the same progenitor stem cell and the maturation of the different cell types is dependent on a number of factors, such as transcription factors and mirnas, that are activated in a tightly regulated pattern  <cit> . one of the central transcription factors in pancreatic development is pancreatic and duodenal homeobox  <dig>   <cit> . in the mature endocrine cells, pdx- <dig> expression is restricted to the β-cell, where it is important for insulin expression  <cit> .

in the present study, we have used a model of type  <dig> diabetes based on β-cell maturation and interleukin-1β  sensitivity. in response to pdx- <dig> induction the cells progress from an immature to a mature β-cell phenotype  <cit> . the β-cell maturation is accompanied by an increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of il-1β that is reflected in both transcriptional and protein expression patterns  <cit> . genes regulated by pdx- <dig> are therefore believed to be involved in the acquired il-1β sensitivity, and identification of these genes would provide knowledge about the mechanisms underlying this β-cell specific trait. interestingly, a study investigating genomic targets of transcription factors in a β-cell line suggested that several mirnas are under pdx- <dig> regulation  <cit> . furthermore, a number of mirnas have been implicated in the regulation of pancreatic development and β-cell differentiation  <cit> .

here, we have developed a novel mirna target prediction method that is based on ica and combines seed matching and expression profiling. we comprehensively profiled both mirna and mrna expressions from the type  <dig> diabetes model. ica was applied on the mrna expression data for identification of mirna targets. our method was compared to negative correlation. we validated our observations by use of pathway analysis and human pancreatic islet preparations.

RESULTS
β-cell specific gene expression
to confirm that the insrαβ cells progressed from a hybrid αβ-like phenotype to a more mature β-cell phenotype upon pdx- <dig> induction as seen in previous studies  <cit> , the expression levels of known insulin and pdx- <dig> dependent genes were examined using the array data . the observed expression profiles were in agreement with insulin and pdx- <dig> regulations known from other studies.

the dox-induced pdx- <dig> expression was examined using qpcr and western blotting with mouse-specific primers and antibody, respectively. we found that dox treatment for  <dig> hours resulted in increased expression of both pdx- <dig> mrna  and protein  .

mirnas differentially expressed in a model of type  <dig> diabetes
mirna expression profiling resulted in identification of eight mirnas with differential expression in response to pdx- <dig> induction and/or il-1β exposure. all eight mirnas  showed significant  changes in expression between conditions and/or time points . the eight mirna expression profiles capture all three experimental conditions: dox-induced pdx- <dig> expression, il-1β exposure and time. for example, the mir- <dig> expression decreased significantly  with time independent of pdx- <dig> induction and/or il-1β treatment. the reversed pattern was seen for mir- <dig>  though only for cells with induced pdx- <dig> expression. a third example was the up-regulating effect of il-1β treatment on the expressions of mir-128/192/ <dig> 

the expression of two of the eight mirnas were validated in a new set of samples using real-time quantitative pcr. we found that the expression of mir- <dig> was significantly decreased in response to pdx- <dig> induction , whereas the mir- <dig> expression was significantly increased in response to il-1β treatment , see figure  <dig>  furthermore, there was a tendency towards a decreased mir- <dig> expression in response to pdx- <dig> induction . these expression changes confirmed the results from the array.

mirna target prediction using negative correlation or ica
to assess the effect of the pdx-1- and il-1β-mediated mirna activity, mrnas were profiled in the same set of samples as used for the mirna arrays.

initially, targets were predicted for each of the eight mirnas using 6mer seed matching. the total number of 6mer seed matches for each mirna is listed in table  <dig>  for identification of mirna targets using negative correlation, correlation coefficients were calculated between each pair of mirna and mrna profiles and the mrnas were ordered according to these correlation coefficients. four of the eight mirnas showed a significant enrichment of sequence predicted targets among mrnas with correlation coefficients close to - <dig> , table  <dig>  additional file  <dig> lists all calculated correlation coefficients.

the table shows the number of 6mer seed matches in the array data for each of the eight mirnas , the q-values  for negative correlation  or load values . the q-values in the 4th column are the lowest q-value found among the five significant ics.

applying ica on the mrna expression data resulted in identification of five highly significant ics  with mixes shown in figure 2b. see additional file  <dig> for all loads, as well as the method section for further details on ica.

for each of the eight mirnas, the loads in each ic were tested for enrichment of predicted targets with a 6mer seed match. seven of the eight mirnas  showed a significant enrichment of sequence predicted targets in the ic loads , table  <dig>  furthermore, we analyzed ic  <dig> for cooperativity between each pair of mirnas by testing the loads in ic  <dig> for enrichment of predicted targets with seed matches for both mirnas .

we found that the mirna pairs mir-375/ <dig>  mir-194/ <dig>  mir-192/ <dig> and mir-124/ <dig> had a significant regulatory effect  when testing for enrichment of their common targets in ic  <dig> 

the mirnas had small fold changes compared to the fold changes of the mrnas. therefore it was not possible to apply ica on the mirna data or on a combination of the mrna and mirna expression matrices. however, by forming a linear superposition of the ics we identified the major contributions from the ics on the mirna expressions. interestingly, all eight mirnas could be represented  by a superposition of the five ics, as shown in figure 2c . the majority of predicted mirna targets were present in two or three of the ics. for example, mir- <dig> primarily has targets in component  <dig> and  <dig>  which both are pdx- <dig> affected components. another example is mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> that both have targets in component  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were affected by both pdx- <dig> and il-1β.

independent components have clear biological profiles
to assess the biological relevance of the identified ics, we tested the ics for enrichment of genes known to be regulated by pdx- <dig> or affected by il-1β . mixes of ic  <dig> clearly correlated with the induction of pdx- <dig>  and genes regulated by pdx- <dig> were overrepresented in this ic . interestingly, one group had low negative loads and another had high positive loads, indicating positive and negative regulation by pdx- <dig>  respectively. similarly, ics  <dig> and  <dig> correlated with the presence or absence of il-1β. specifically, ic  <dig> was enriched for known il-1β affected genes among genes with low negative load , whereas ic  <dig> was enriched for il-1β affected genes with high positive load .

in a similar manner, we tested the ics for enrichment of mirna targets associated with metabolic or signalling pathways, as annotated by kegg  <cit>  or by the molecular signatures database . specifically, we tested the genes with high positive or low negative loads in each ic for overrepresentation of annotated pathway genes.

when using kegg terms only,  <dig> pathways were significantly enriched for mirna targets in the five ics . the most significant and diabetes-relevant pathways are shown in figure  <dig> . notable was the significance of genes with low loads in ic  <dig> belonging to the t1d pathway. ic  <dig> had a clear correlation with stimulation of il-1β. furthermore, the pathways maturity onset diabetes of the young , type  <dig> diabetes  mellitus and oxidative phosphorylation were significant. the first two have an obvious relation to diabetes, and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway has been shown to be related to both type  <dig> and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . when using msigdb annotations,  <dig> pathways were significantly enriched for mirna targets belonging to the five ics . a selection of the pathways is shown in figure  <dig> . since kegg is part of msigdb it comes as no surprise that t2d, mody and oxidative phosphorylation again showed up as significant. however, t1d did not show up as a significant pathway, probably due to correction of multiple testing, since msigdb is a much larger repository. also, dysregulation of genes involved in the p <dig> signaling pathway have been suggested to sensitize the cells to apoptotic stimuli  <cit> . in accordance with this, we find genes annotated with the p53-signalling pathway  having significant low loads in ic  <dig> 

identification of mirna regulatory networks
mirnas and mrnas can interact in regulatory networks. mirnas can regulate mrnas directly or indirectly through secondary factors. furthermore, mrna targets can act as transcription factors for mirnas, thus forming a regulatory loop.

using a combined bioinformatics approach involving seed matching, promoter analysis, text mining and ica we identified mirna regulatory networks . using the mirna database http://www.mirbase.org, we found stat <dig> binding sites in the promoter of the human mir- <dig> gene. this interaction was supported by ica that showed that mir- <dig> and stat <dig> both have negative contribution from ic  <dig>  correlating with an up-regulation in response to pdx- <dig> induction. interestingly, the 3'utr of stat <dig> has seed matches for mir- <dig> , indicating a potential feedback loop.

furthermore, we found positive and negative contribution from ic  <dig> for pax <dig> and mir-124/ <dig>  respectively , meaning they have reciprocal expressions  in response to pdx- <dig> induction. interestingly, the 3'utr of pax <dig> contains a 6mer seed match for mir- <dig> indicating potential repression of pax <dig> by mir- <dig> 

validation in human pancreatic islets and β-cell studies
to verify the identified mirna targets affected by pdx- <dig> and/or cytokine stimulation, we used mrna expression profiling data from studies on human pancreatic islets and rat β-cell lines and tested whether the data were enriched for ica-identified targets of the eight mirnas.

using mrna profiling data from untreated and cytokine treated human pancreatic islet preparations  we tested the cytokine-induced fold changes for enrichment of predicted mirna targets. interestingly, we found that predicted targets of mir-128/192/194/204/ <dig> were significantly up-regulated in response to cytokine treatment as compared to non-targets . the results suggest that the five mirnas may play a role in human pancreatic islets as well.

additionally, we performed similar analysis of publicly available data from two previous studies on β-cells. cardozo et al.  <cit>  performed mrna profiling on β-cells from  <dig> weeks old male wistar rats, un-stimulated or stimulated with cytokines . using their mrna data, we found that targets of mir- <dig> were significantly down-regulated in response to il-1β stimulation when comparing to non-targets . kutlu et al.  <cit>  performed mrna profiling on insulin producing ins-1e cells, untreated or exposed to a combination of il-1β and ifnγ. in their data set, we found that the expressions of mir- <dig> targets were significant increased in response to cytokine exposure when comparing to non-targets .

discussion
the motivation for applying a more advanced method like ica for mirna target prediction than negative correlation was that surprisingly few mrnas have clear negative correlations with their targeting mirnas. this is probably due to the mrna profiles being influenced by a number of factors e.g. mirna regulation, transcription factor binding and site accessibility. here, ica was used as an attempt to filter the factors influencing mrna expression. decomposition of microarray data using ica has been shown to outperform other linear data representations, such as pca  <cit> . several target prediction methods have incorporated mirna and mrna profiling data. however, none of them uses ica.

the mirna array profiling identified eight mirnas with differential expression in a type  <dig> diabetes model. performing ica on the mrna expressions from the same samples resulted in five ics that correlated with the experimental conditions studied. comparing the two target prediction methods indicated that ica was better at capturing mirna activity than negative correlation. seven mirnas showed a significant enrichment of sequence-predicted targets when using ica, as compared to only four by use of negative correlation. interestingly, the ics were enriched for mirna targets with functional roles in diabetes-relevant pathways e.g. the pathways t1d, t2d, mody, oxidative phosphorylation, insulin, cytokine-cytokine receptors and type  <dig> interferon. this supports that the eight mirnas are implicated in disease mechanisms in diabetes. additionally, targets of five of the eight mirnas were significantly regulated by cytokines in models of β-cell destruction e.g. in human islets.

mirnas fine tune the expression of genes in a combinatorial manner, meaning that several mirnas can target the same mrna transcript  <cit> . furthermore, a cluster of co-expressed mirnas can regulate functionally related genes  <cit> . in this study, we observe small expression changes in the mirnas. however, even minute changes in mirna expressions might have impact on mrna expression, and mirnas acting in a cooperative manner can most likely induce biologically relevant expression changes in their targets. ica can uncover these more complex interactions. interestingly, it was recently suggested that cooperativity could be incorporated for prediction of target interactions between different mirnas  <cit> . for the eight mirnas we identified, there is a significant overlap in the mrnas they target. we have incorporated cooperativity between mirnas pairwise and identified four mirna pairs  that had a significant co-regulatory effect on their common targets in ic  <dig> 

of the eight significant mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have previously been identified in β-cells  <cit> . further, the expression of mir- <dig> has been shown to be induced in insulinomas, where its expression correlated with insulin expression  <cit> .

that mir- <dig> was significantly regulated strengthens our model since a previous study observed interaction between pdx- <dig>  and the mir- <dig> locus  <cit> . however, no pdx- <dig> consensus binding sites were identified, but binding elements for other transcription factors have been identified in the mir- <dig> locus  <cit> . the decreased mir- <dig> expression could, at least in part, be mediated through neurod <dig>  since we observed a decreased neurod <dig> expression in response to pdx- <dig> induction. additionally, the decreased mir- <dig> expression is in agreement with mir- <dig> having a higher expression level in non-β-cells than in β-cells  <cit> . this is also supported by our findings in α-cells versus β-cells . interestingly, both mir- <dig> and pax <dig>  a key factor in α-cell development, had negative loads in ic  <dig>  i.e. both were down-regulated in response to pdx- <dig>  the decreased mir- <dig> expression is also in compliance with the function of mir- <dig> as a negative regulator of insulin exocytosis  <cit> , since it correlates with the need for an increased insulin secretion in the mature β-cell phenotype. similarly, mir- <dig> has been shown to modulate insulin secretion by targeting foxa <dig>  <cit> . mir- <dig> is highly expressed in liver and in intestinal epithelial cells, where it is under regulation by hnf1α  <cit> . interestingly, hnf1α is required for proper β-cell function and mutations in this gene cause mody  <cit> . mir- <dig> is also expressed in the liver and is in cluster with mir- <dig>  suggesting co-regulation  <cit> . furthermore, mir- <dig> has been shown to induce apoptosis in kidney cells through interaction with bax  <cit> . so far, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have not been examined in β-cells. the likely involvement of mir-128/192/194/204/ <dig> in β-cell regulatory networks  and the high expression in β-cells compared to α-cells for mir-672/ <dig>  make them interesting candidates for further studies.

we have used ica for bioinformatics investigation of the functional roles of the mirnas and their targets. ica in combination with pathway analysis indicates that the eight mirnas, through their mrna targets, are implicated in several diabetes relevant pathways.

the transcriptional changes mediated by mirnas on their targets may not be entirely explained by direct repression but may also reflect indirect mechanisms such as activation by feedback and feed-forward transcriptional loops within regulatory networks  <cit> . mirnas can be important players in these networks. by use of a combined bioinformatics approach we identified mirna regulatory networks. the results suggest connections between seven of the eight mirnas through interactions with key pancreatic transcription factors, cytokine signalling molecules and insulin .

CONCLUSIONS
using ica, we have developed a novel mirna target prediction method that incorporates seed matching and expression profiling. we believe that the method has advantages compared to simple negative correlation. additionally, ica in combination with bioinformatics approaches such as pathway analysis constitutes a means of prioritizing between the predicted mirna targets for further investigations. to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that uses ica for mirna target prediction. interestingly, applying the method on a model of type  <dig> diabetes resulted in identification of eight mirnas that appear to directly or indirectly affect pathways of relevance to disease mechanisms in diabetes.
