BACKGROUND
genes within an operon are, in the majority of cases, transcribed from a single promoter  <cit> . therefore, any integrated approach to the understanding of gene expression in prokaryotic systems must consider operons as one of the basic units, which are regulated by promoters, transcription factors and associated proteins. although over  <dig> bacterial genomes have been sequenced and microarray-based expression studies are increasingly common, defining and mapping operon structure is time-consuming and complex, and the ability to predict them ab initio is therefore important. since operon structure is frequently unstable across species boundaries  <cit> , most approaches have used non-homology based data to predict operon structure. besides predicted promoters and terminators, intergenic distance and expression data are also often used in non-homology based operon prediction strategies with varying sensitivity  <cit> . however, since there is generally limited data on known promoter locations and/or unreliable prediction methods, the identification of promoters is often difficult and makes their use problematic for operon prediction. in an attempt to avoid the problems associated with prediction of promoters it is worthwhile investigating the usefulness of other regulatory binding sites as potential predictors of operons, something not previously attempted.

aside from promoters and terminators, transcription factor binding plays a key role in controlling the expression level of a gene or group of genes. therefore, to coordinate the expression of genes within an operon a transcription factor binding site , just like promoters, should be found predominantly upstream of the first gene in an operon; although there are a small number of reported cases of secondary binding sites within operons e.g. lac operon  <cit>  and in our previous study  <cit> , the traditional, 'static' view of operons  is applied. prokaryotic transcription factors are usually deemed as either activators or repressors  depending on the effect they have on the rate of transcription initiation of the downstream gene. the dimeric nature of repressor and activator binding in prokaryotes requires that a recognition site must be a dyad, and typically an inverted repeat  <cit> . this 'structure' of a binding sequence coupled with their typically short length  can be used to predict likely tfbss themselves  <cit>  and therefore if this can be done with confidence, can be used in the prediction of operonic gene pairs.

tfbss are often described as consensus sequences or regular expressions that represent the most common sequence in a set of closely related binding site examples. though simple in their construction, such consensus sequences are unable to imitate the variability that exists within true tfbss in nature, where some sites may tolerate a range of bases and retain function. when using simple regular expressions, tfbs prediction is therefore dependent on the amount of mismatches  that are tolerated. defining the best consensus sequence for predicting sites is also difficult  <cit> . position specific weight matrices , first used for the characterisation of translation initiation sites  <cit>  are an alternative to consensus sequences. the methods used to produce pswms differ mainly in the type of information used to collect a set of binding site examples. for example, the identification of regulatory motifs which can be used to predict regulons, commonly adopted after microarray data collection, uses a set of co-regulated genes as a prerequisite . similarly, prior knowledge can be used where experimental characterisation of a common regulatory binding site leads to the searching of upstream regions of the genes for a similar motif  <cit> . knowledge of protein structure has also been applied to regulatory protein binding site identification through binding energy calculations between nucleotide and amino acid . in this study however, we wished to develop a method applicable to streptomyces coelicolor genomics and due to the relative paucity of comprehensive information on streptomyces gene regulation an a priori method that is capable of producing pswms is desirable. it will also support an operon prediction method that integrates data from various sources  by increasing the amount of information about an operon whilst still being applied generically to all sequenced prokaryotic species without a dependency on the availability of functional or structural information.

one such method was published by the siggia group  <cit>  which requires no prior knowledge, can in principle be applied to any genome, and can generate pswms of dyads. the algorithm has successfully been applied in e. coli  <cit> , b. subtilis  <cit>  and additionally to s. coelicolor  <cit> . here the published method  <cit>  was implemented and applied in escherichia coli and streptomyces coelicolor.

by constructing pswms from over-represented words in a given data set it is possible to test the upstream regions of genes for putative tfbss. based on the 'classical' definition of an operon  <cit>  intra-operonic genes  should not have a tfbs in their upstream region. although this is increasingly viewed as overly simplistic as an operon definition  <cit>  it appears to hold for the large majority of operons in most conditions. subsequently, adjacent gene pairs that have a tfbs in between them are not expected to be part of the same operon. using positive and negative examples of genes which are considered to be operonic members, the use of tfbss as predictors of operons can be tested.

prior to this, the first part of this work characterises the palindromic tendency of footprints of known transcription factors in e. coli, a property which is later shown to improve operon prediction in s. coelicolor. the second part of this work concentrates on developing a strategy of implementing the siggia group's algorithm  <cit>  through the use of different thresholds and examines the differences in results obtained. comparisons with the previous tfbs set predicted in s. coelicolor  <cit>  are also made. finally the usefulness of tfbss as predictors of operons in both e. coli and s. coelicolor is discussed.

methods
many methods are used to test the efficacy of tfbs at predicting operons in this work, which are summarised in figure  <dig> 

pswm construction algorithm
the algorithm published by li and co-workers  <cit>  is capable of taking any set of upstream sequences  and constructing pswms from significantly over-represented dimers within this set. this method can be summarised by five steps:

1) counts of every possible dimer  of the form w <dig> nx w <dig> where w <dig> and w <dig> are short oligonucleotides of length 3– <dig> nt separated by x  arbitrary bases are collected from the upsqs set. for each dimer a significance  is calculated by comparing the observed counts ) for the dimer to the expected counts ), assuming a poisson distribution:

 p=∑n≥nynn!e−y 

where

 y=leffnleffnleff 

and n and n are the total number of occurrences of w <dig> and w <dig> in the upsqs data set and leff=∑r−l+1) is the number of independent positions in the data where a motif m of length l can be placed . the summation is over the regulatory regions  over all genes, each with a length l .

2) a similarity matrix is constructed via an all-vs-all comparison of significant dimer pairs scoring above a designated threshold. similarity between pairs of dimers is calculated by a simple scoring method, evaluating the number of matches minus the number of mismatches. matches to n  or to any other base or overhangs are ignored . this score is then normalised to between  <dig> and  <dig> 

3) the similarity matrix is used to cluster the significant dimers using cast  where a similarity threshold for clustering is set.

4) for every cluster, the actual sequences in the upsqs set matched by any member of the cluster are extracted along with up to  <dig> flanking nucleotides . a multiple alignment of these sequences using consensus  <cit>  produces an alignment matrix for that cluster.

5) each alignment matrix is converted to a pswm using the background base counts for the organism of interest. here the background frequencies of a =  <dig> , c =  <dig> , g =  <dig> , t =  <dig>  were used for e. coli and a =  <dig> , c =  <dig> , g =  <dig> , t =  <dig>  for s. coelicolor.

a full description of the algorithm is given in the original publication  <cit> .

in this work the thresholds used in steps  <dig>  and  <dig>  are of the most interest. it is these thresholds that can affect the integrity of the pswms, which in turn could affect operon prediction accuracy. the different thresholds of dimer significance used were: -log <dig> p >  <dig>  approximating to -log <dig>  -log <dig> p >  <dig>  approximating to -log <dig> dimers tested for), and two intermediate thresholds of -log <dig> p >  <dig> and -log <dig> p >  <dig>  different clustering thresholds of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were also tested.

prediction of tfbss
with each pswm there is an associated distribution of scores obtained when applied to a given data set of sequences. two distributions of scores are obtained when scoring sequences from either the upsqs set that were used to build the pswm , or sequences from the upsqs set that were not used to build the pswm  and thus provide a means of estimating noise in the pswm prediction). these two gaussian distributions, describe the 'real hits' and the background random matches respectively.

from the mean and standard deviation of the two distributions, the difference between the two distributions can be calculated. the larger the difference, the more specific the pswm is deemed to be, which is formally represented as a z-score:

 z=μreal−μbackgroundσbackground 

using the mean and standard deviation of the two distributions the specificity and sensitivity of searching for a potential tfbs can be controlled via two thresholds:

 threshold <dig> = μbackground + xσbackground 

 threshold <dig> = μreal - xσreal 

where x represents any real number and affects the false-positive and false-negative rates when using threshold <dig> and threshold <dig> respectively.

in this study for a sequence to be predicted to contain a given tfbs the score of the sequence against the pswm must be greater than μreal-2σreal  and μbackground+sσbackground, where s is used to represent trials of different thresholds from  <dig> to  <dig> in  <dig>  increments as discussed further in this work. since this term is the only part of the threshold that changes, the tfbs prediction threshold used will only be referred to herein as μbackground+sσbackground.

upsqs data sets used
the sequence data used to form the upsqs and operon prediction test sets were taken from e. coli k <dig> strain mg <dig> from genbank  and s. coelicolor chromosome  in embl . in e. coli the upsqs set was created using the upstream intergenic sequences  of the first genes of known and predicted operons in the e. coli sequence taken from regulondb  <cit>  as described previously  <cit> . for s. coelicolor upstream intergenic sequences  of all genes in the chromosome were used. testing of the constructed pswms was conducted using the upstream intergenic sequences  of the positive and negative examples of operon members of the relevant organism.

positive and negative examples of operon members
operon definitions used throughout this work were based on the annotated genome of e. coli k <dig> strain mg <dig> from genbank  <cit>  and the s. coelicolor chromosome  in embl  <cit> , data sources described above. positive examples of operons were collected through searching the literature for experimentally validated operons in s. coelicolor  and from the transcriptional unit experimentally based annotation in ecocyc for e. coli  <cit> . negative examples of operons were collected from knowledge of basic operon structure applicable to both organisms, illustrated in figure  <dig> 

assuming that the entire polycistronic transcript is documented, non-operons of length  <dig> were formed by using the initial gene of the operon and its upstream neighbouring gene if that neighbour is transcribed in the same direction , and the last gene in the documented operon and its downstream neighbouring gene, again if it is transcribed in the same direction . these negative examples are termed as transcriptional boundaries. to increase the size of the non-operonic data set a non-operon of length  <dig> was also formed by collecting triplets of genes that are transcribed in the opposite direction , termed as directional examples, as the central gene  is certainly not in the same transcriptional unit as the two flanking genes transcribed in the opposite direction . in total  <dig> operons and  <dig> non-operons were collected for s. coelicolor, and  <dig> operons and  <dig> non-operons were collected for e. coli. both positive and negative examples for s. coelicolor and e. coli are provided .

all examples of operonic genes  were split into singular genes such that the operonic connection status  of all genes with their respective upstream gene neighbours could be tested.

RESULTS
characterisation of inverted repeat binding sites
typically for prokaryotes the binding sites of repressors, dual regulators and in some cases activators are characterised as inverted repeats , which is driven by the predominantly homo-dimeric binding of transcription factors  <cit> . however, 'perfect' palindromicity of a binding site where the two words are an exact match is not always the case e.g. the lac operator  <cit> . given the tendency for binding sites to be imperfect palindromes it is therefore appropriate to analyse how many sites would be missed if only perfectly palindromic inverted repeat pswms were used when predicting tfbss as a proxy for operons. through the use of footprinting methods, where flanking nucleotides not bound by a transcription factor are degraded, a 'footprint' of the transcription factor can be obtained  <cit> . although it is difficult to determine the precise binding site, the footprint sequences can be used as an estimate of the potential palindromicity of the experimentally characterised binding regions. currently, there is little footprint data for s. coelicolor transcription factors and consequently transcription factor footprint data for e. coli was downloaded from the regulondb internet site  <cit> , which contained examples of  <dig> repressor sites,  <dig> activator sites and  <dig> dual regulator sites . all footprints for each set of regulators  were then searched for the longest inverted repeat containing palindromes word  <dig> and word  <dig> and the 'palindromicity' calculated. here, palindromicity was determined by the use of two thresholds; length and mismatches allowed. figure  <dig> shows the percentage of known sites  that can be characterised as an inverted repeat with each word of length  <dig>   <dig>  or greater than  <dig> nucleotides, and having either  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> internal palindromic mismatches between word  <dig> and word  <dig> .

from figure  <dig>  and additionally table  <dig>  it is apparent that both repressors and dual regulators are predominantly characterised by perfectly palindromic dyads , agreeing with previous findings  <cit> . activators on the other hand, described in the literature as capable of binding to direct/inverted repeats, are not . furthermore, the largest proportion of perfectly palindromic inverted repeats is formed from words of  <dig> nucleotides in length, particularly dual regulators . as expected, allowing for  <dig> internal mismatch increases the overall proportion of palindromic dyad sites matched compared to no mismatches allowed, but only a negligible increase is observed when considering  <dig> mismatches. indeed, this typically just increased the length of the potential sites compared to the  <dig> mismatch set .

coverage of known sites and random sites  considering different mismatch tolerances is shown with associated z-score and p-values for each regulator type. coverage is defined as the percentage of sites  that are identified as being palindromic when allowing  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mismatches. the average coverage of  <dig> simulations is shown for the random data set 

when considering all transcription factor footprints together, as depicted in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the overall coverage obtained using palindromes and mismatches to characterise binding sites can be calculated. coverage is defined as the percentage of all footprint sites identified as containing a palindrome. here, 77% coverage can be achieved by searching for perfect palindromes and 92–93% coverage when allowing for  <dig> mismatch. however, it is important to note that tolerating mismatches decreases the specificity of binding site prediction. of course, the occurrence of a palindromic inverted repeat within an upstream intergenic region does not necessarily mean that a sequence is a true binding site either, but it is expected to increase the likelihood. indeed, in support of this, when comparing the coverage obtained  searching for perfect palindromes in true footprint sites to that obtained from  <dig> random footprint simulations a significant difference  is observed . here, random bases were chosen to create a sequence the same length of true, known footprint examples taken from those used to create figure  <dig>  no significant difference was observed when allowing  <dig> or  <dig> mismatches for repressors and dual regulators.

implementation of pswm algorithm
implementation of the pswm construction algorithm using e. coli sequences resulted in  <dig>  significant dimers using a poisson probability threshold of -log <dig> p >  <dig>  although this is a similar threshold to previous work  <cit> , these authors identified only  <dig>  significant dimers. despite rigorous checks with the implementation of this algorithm as published, and variation of parameters and similar experiments to reproduce the published data, this was not achieved and the implementation here consistently defined a larger number of putative sites. however, our implementation did discover all the dimers predicted by the earlier study  <cit> , and this set was also used in our evaluation protocol.

different thresholds of dimer significance  were then applied and sets of significant dimers were clustered using cast  <cit>   producing  <dig> data sets in total. in addition to these  <dig> sets of clustered sequences, the  <dig> clusters published previously  <cit> , referred to as "liflank", were put through steps  <dig> and  <dig> of the pswm construction algorithm. the resultant pswms for all data sets and the original pswm data  <cit> , referred to as "li", were then used to predict binding sites in the upstream intergenic sequences of the positive and negative examples of operon members in e. coli with  <dig>  increments of the tfbs prediction threshold μbackground+sσbackground . for each increment of s, counts of tfbs predictions for the positive and negative tests sets were made enabling the calculation of true positives , false positives , true negatives  and false negatives .

throughout this work we introduce a simple nomenclature to distinguish the pswm sets, x_y_z, which refers to the poisson distribution dimer significance threshold x, the word clustering threshold y, and the final number of clusters z.

using predicted tfbss as predictors of operons creates slightly unusual statistics, since an absence of an upstream predicted tfbs is predictive for a member gene of an operon. hence when a high threshold is used, no tfbss are predicted by the pswms leading to over-prediction of operonic status – i.e. all genes in both operon member test sets are classed as operonic. this leads to a sensitivity  of  <dig> and a specificity of  <dig>  and the positive predictive value converges to the ratio of operonic/all genes. this is illustrated in the receiver operator characteristic  plots in figures 4a and 4b. similarly, at very low thresholds, tfbss are over-predicted and most genes are classed as non-operonic. in this case, the sensitivity approaches  <dig> and the specificity approaches 1; the positive predictive value is undefined here. figure 4a shows that at a low tfbs prediction threshold  it is more likely that sequences without a predicted tfbs are operonic . as the tfbs prediction threshold increases, fewer tfbss are predicted leading to less certainty about a gene's true operonic status. indeed, only ~28% of genes predicted to be operonic are actually operonic at the highest tfbs prediction threshold. the predictions and roc plots can be compared using a single metric, the area under the curve , which is a measure used to quantify the overall performance accuracy of predictions. the complete list of auc values for different data sets is shown in table  <dig>  the best performing pswm set at discriminating operonic/non-operonic genes is the liflank data set with 80% accuracy. this increase in accuracy compared to the original li data set  is likely due to the wider pswms which incorporate flanking sequence. during step  <dig> of the pswm building pipeline consensus  <cit>  requires a fixed pattern length to be supplied. in this work the length is determined by the length of the shortest sequence matched back to the cluster during step  <dig>  comparisons between the length of the liflank pswms and the original li pswms sets revealed that the liflank pswms were predominantly wider. the wider pswms and the higher accuracy of the liflank data set therefore indicate that the length of the matrix is important for operon prediction. this is not surprising as the wider a pswm is, the more specific it generally becomes.

the auc score is shown for each of the  <dig> pswm sets when predicting operons using the positive and negative examples of operon members of e. coli. data set nomenclature x_y_z refers to: x, poisson distribution dimer significance threshold  or data set, y, clustering threshold, and z, the number of clusters/pswms in data set .

the second best operon predictor set  is of one of the novel pswm sets constructed in this study . the dimer significance of -log <dig> p >  <dig> and clustering threshold of  <dig>  was therefore used to construct pswms for s. coelicolor resulting in  <dig>  significant dimers producing  <dig>  clusters/pswms . previous work applying the same approach on s. coelicolor  <cit>  reported  <dig>  putative tfbss. however, using dyad word lengths of 3– <dig> nt  instead of just  <dig> nt results in additional matrices, as well as all of the matrices found previously  <cit> .

tfbss for operon prediction
figures 5a and 5b show the roc curves for e. coli pswm set 3_08_ <dig> and s. coelicolor pswm set s3_08_ <dig> respectively when applied to the relevant positive and negative operon member example datasets. when comparing auc scores of the test sets using all of the pswms it can be seen that overall tfbss perform better as predictors of operons in e. coli  than s. coelicolor . however, the auc score of s. coelicolor increased to 77% when using only palindromic  pswms , calculated by using the consensus sequence conveyed by a pswm  <cit>  and applying the same palindromicity method as previously described. conversely, operon prediction accuracy in e. coli did not improve when using only palindromic dimers of the original 3_08_ <dig> pswm set.

the tfbs prediction threshold of μbackground+4σbackground with a very low false positive rate of ~ <dig> % was found to produce the highest operon prediction accuracy /) in e. coli 3_08_1506_all  and s. coelicolor s3_08_3628_ <dig> . using this threshold it was possible to analyse how a single pswm's operon prediction accuracy is related to its z-score , the amount of tfbs predictions it makes, its at-richness , and its non-coding region bias . the resultant plots are shown in figure  <dig> for s. coelicolor and figure  <dig> for e. coli.

from figures  <dig> and  <dig> it is apparent, particularly in s. coelicolor , that the higher a pswm's z-score , the lower the pswm operon prediction accuracy. somewhat counter intuitively, this suggests that the more successful pswms in terms of operon prediction accuracy predict many tfbss  such that very few operonic predictions are made. further evidence for this can be seen in figures  <dig> and  <dig> which show accuracy is correlated to the amount of hits, whereby many hits equates to higher accuracy. this demonstrates that high operon prediction accuracy is obtained by maximising sensitivity  of the tfbs prediction, albeit at the expense of tfbs prediction specificity, and without over-predicting tfbss either.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> also consider nucleotide biases. in e. coli the at-richness of a pswm does not appear to be related to accuracy due to the wide distribution of scores . in s. coelicolor however the matrices that are more at rich tend to have a higher operon prediction accuracy, seen as a right shift in figure  <dig>  at tracts in the transcription initiation region of genes are not uncommon  <cit>  but when the pswm operon prediction is restricted to using pswms of the set s3_08_3628_ <dig> that have an at-richness greater than 40%, no effect on operon prediction accuracy was found . finally there does not seem to be any relatedness between a pswm's accuracy and its bias towards non coding regions in both e. coli and s. coelicolor .

discussion
to date non-homology based operon prediction methods that search upstream regions for motifs have only included promoters and/or terminators  <cit> . data is presented here that uses a different upstream motif, transcription factor binding sites, to predict operons in both s. coelicolor and e. coli. avoiding the need for experimentally validated examples of promoters/terminators and therefore dependency on the amount of prior knowledge available  <cit>  this novel approach is able to predict operons in e. coli and s. coelicolor with 83% and 93% accuracy respectively. this strongly suggests that predicted tfbss are a highly suitable feature for inclusion in integrated operon prediction strategies, not only in well characterised systems but also in other poorly-annotated but sequenced prokaryotes, where good quality tfbs predictions can be obtained ab initio with the protocol described here. it should be noted here that our definition of non-operonic genes is expanded by considering triplets with genes transcribed in opposite directions and that the overall prediction accuracy falls to around 64% when only the transcriptional boundary set are used. however, this drop off also occurs using intergenic distance as the sole predictor, reducing to 62% accuracy with the same data set . thus, our claim is not that predicted tfbs alone are superior operon predictors, rather that they should be used as independent features that offer a complementary approach.

indeed, tfbs may offer other advantages. thus far intergenic distance has proven to be the most accurate single feature for operon prediction in e. coli and b. subtilis  <cit> . intergenic distance is implicitly linked to our method since tfbs identification/prediction is focused on intergenic non-coding regions only. comparing the operon prediction accuracy in s. coelicolor of the tfbs and intergenic distance approach  both features achieve similar accuracy  when applied to the same positive and negative  operon example data set. the operon predictions themselves however are not perfectly correlated between the two approaches, although there is a strong correlation – around  <dig>  depending on thresholds used for tfbs and intergenic distance predictions. hence, the two features are complementary, and their combination is expected to produce further improvement in operon prediction. finally, although both methods perform equally well, tfbss as predictors of operons are advantageous since additional regulatory information about a particular putative operon may be inferred.

this protocol derives genome-specific pswms  representing significant dimers, which can subsequently be exploited for operon prediction. the majority  of experimentally validated e. coli transcription factor binding footprints can be characterised as palindromic  and consequently the pswm set was filtered prior to operon prediction. restricting the pswm data set to 'perfect' palindromes  increased operon prediction accuracy in s. coelicolor but not e. coli and therefore, and supports the conclusion that genome-specific models for operon prediction should be employed  <cit> . the improved performance in s. coelicolor compared to e. coli may be a result of the pswm construction strategy. the complete upstream intergenic regions were used in s. coelicolor whilst a restricted set based on annotated tfbss was used in e. coli to find over-represented dimers. this would be expected to lead to increased coverage in s. coelicolor, and perhaps increased specificity in e. coli. this is borne out by the results, where high tfbs prediction coverage leads to superior operon prediction performance.

the false negatives  in this operon prediction strategy are intra-operonic genes  that have a predicted binding site  in their upstream non-coding regions. the existence of these is not wholly surprising given our previous results  <cit>  which demonstrated that intra-operonic genes with increased expression relative to the first gene of the same operon are more likely to have a predicted tfbs in their upstream non-coding regions. this intra-operonic promotion of gene expression has been noted by other groups  <cit> . using a μbackground+4σbackground as a pswm threshold we found that 23% of the s. coelicolor and 43% of the e. coli false negatives  had higher expression than the first gene of the same operon. therefore, when microarray expression data is available, it is possible to combine this with high quality tfbs predictions to improve the overall accuracy of operon prediction and gain information on the dynamic nature of some operons . this would not be possible with the application of intergenic distance alone to predict operons, and offers a way forward to address the true complexity of operon regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
this work has demonstrated the suitability of predicted tfbss as operon predictors independently. we are currently working on a genome specific operon predictor for both s. coelicolor and e. coli that is able to combine tfbss and other features found to be useful in operon predictions . integrated approaches to operon prediction in prokaryotes are clearly needed, since expression of genes within operons is affected by several factors, not least the presence of suitable transcription factor binding sites, and array-based data on its own is insufficient to understand this phenomenon. indeed, a recently developed operon prediction method for s. coelicolor  <cit>  that combines intergenic distance, expression data and terminators, whilst able to show comparable operon prediction accuracy to that presented here, is unable to predict 'dynamic' operons, defined as the isolated expression of a gene from their 'common'  transcriptional unit to which they reside. the findings of this work suggests that tfbs are a useful feature for predicting operons of all prokaryotes in their own right but also have the capacity to allow the modelling of dynamic operon structures of an entire genome in a particular, specific condition  when combined with expression data  <cit> .
