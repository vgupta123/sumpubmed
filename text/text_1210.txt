BACKGROUND
the human major histocompatibility complex  is a gene-dense region on chromosome 6p <dig> , and comprises a group of genes that are involved functionally with the adaptive and innate immune system. from centromere to telomere, it is divided into five regions: extended class ii, classical class ii, class iii, classical class i and extended class i. the classical mhc contains  <dig> genes, many of which are pseudogenes, and with every two in five expressed genes having a potential immune function and a role in disease resistance  <cit> , this region has become a focal locus in comparative genomics. antibody and t cell mediated immune responses against invading pathogens are initiated through mhc class i and class ii molecules  <cit> . these main components are not only missing from invertebrates, but are also not present in primitive jawless fish, such as hagfish and lamprey  <cit> . mhc class i and ii molecules do, however, exist in all jawed vertebrates, including the cartilaginous fish. the gene loci in the class iii region encode a variety of proteins with both immune and non-immune functions  <cit> .

genomic sequences encompassing the mhc are currently available for human, chimpanzee, macaque, rat, mouse, cat, pig, horse, quail, chicken, frog, teleost fish and shark  <cit> . while the genomic architecture of the mammalian mhc is conserved, the number of genes between species can differ greatly. in birds, for example, the minimal essential mhc in chicken consists of  <dig> genes  <cit>  while gene duplications have expanded this region in quail  <cit>  and sparrows  <cit> . the linkage of class i, ii, and iii region genes can be traced back to cartilaginous fish, which are the earliest jawed vertebrates known to have diverged from a common ancestor with humans  <cit> . mhc loci, however, do not always exist in a single tightly linked cluster as generally observed in mammals. a large scale inversion has separated the class iib cluster from the mhc-linked class iia cluster in cattle  <cit> . the class i and class ii loci in zebrafish  are found on different chromosomes  <cit> . a similar organisation is present in trout, stickleback, common guppy and cichlid fish  <cit> . this observation demonstrates that the separation of the mhc class i and class ii loci is characteristic of teleost fish, which represent half of all vertebrates. since the genes of the immune system were present in the common ancestor of tetrapods and teleosts, the differences in their genomic organisation may be the result of lineage-specific chromosomal events such as duplications, inversions, deletions and translocations.

the genome of the zebrafish is currently being sequenced at the wellcome trust sanger institute. the availability of sequence data will allow an insight into the understanding and evolution of the immune system in fish. to date, small regions containing major histocompatibility genes have been mapped by radiation hybrid mapping and sequencing of select genomic clones  <cit> . with the ongoing whole-genome sequencing efforts and the compilation of physical maps, it is now possible to examine larger genomic regions and assess the degree of shared synteny between mammals and fish on a genome-wide scale. here we have utilised a comprehensive whole-genome shotgun assembly data set to fully analyse the zebrafish loci that are related to the human mhc. the human genome contains at least three regions that are paralogous to the mhc  <cit> . these are thought to be the result of two rounds of duplications that occurred early during vertebrate evolution. in this study, we examine the genome-wide distribution of paralogous genes in zebrafish.

RESULTS
analysis of the mhc class i region in zebrafish
the mhc class i region in human embodies gene clusters coding for hla class i molecules, histones, solute carriers, vomeronasal receptors, olfactory receptors and zinc fingers  <cit> . these clusters have undergone a large-scale expansion and each has paralogues throughout the genome. ten representative members of the extended class i region, which are expressed and have paralogues in the human genome, and more than  <dig> genes that reside in the classical class i region were chosen for this analysis . genes that were excluded from this study included pseudogenes, zinc fingers with the tripartite motif , and ring finger proteins. approximately half of the human genes were identified in the zebrafish whole-genome assembly, predominantly on chromosome  <dig>  because multigene families evolve by a birth-and-death process  <cit> , orthologous genes are usually difficult to identify through sequence similarity searches.

chromosome  <dig> harbours the largest number of mhc genes in zebrafish . the core region, comprising genes encoding the classical peptide presenting class i molecules , proteasome subunits , atp-binding cassettes  and tapasin , cluster tightly together and span approximately  <dig> kb of dna. over  <dig> mb downstream of these loci are several other genes that span the human mhc region, although these are not all found adjacent to each other. in humans, mhc class i molecules are expressed on the surface of most cells and are recognized by cd8+ cytotoxic t cells. they are heterodimers composed of an alpha subunit, encoded by the mhc, and a beta subunit, or b- <dig> microglobulin , which maps to chromosome 15q21â€“q <dig> . in zebrafish too, the b2m gene is found located in a different part of the genome on chromosome  <dig>  previously unmapped class i ze lineage genes  <cit>  and novel mhc class i antigen fragments have been identified on chromosome  <dig> and scaffold  <dig>  the additional functional class i lineage  is also present in two other cyprinids , and not linked to other class i and ii genes.

analysis of the mhc class ii region in zebrafish
mhc class ii molecules are heterodimers comprising a  and b  chains that present peptides to cd4+ t cells via the endosomal pathway. one class iia  and six class iib  genes have previously been identified by screening a zebrafish genomic bac library  <cit> . only the mhc2dab and mhc2daa genes are known to be expressed  <cit> . they are closely linked and were identified on chromosome  <dig> . analysis of approximately  <dig> mb of contiguous dna surrounding the functional class ii region in zebrafish demonstrates the presence of  <dig> flanking genes mapping to various human chromosomal locations, including two or more genes mapping to human 6q , 12q , 20q , 22q  and xp . the lack of genes mapping to the human mhc, in addition to the low gene density of this region, indicates that the functional zebrafish class ii region is the result of a translocation event  <cit> .

mapping to chromosome  <dig>  approximately  <dig> mb telomeric of the class i region, is the class iib gene mhc2dcb-rs , with a similar sequence on contig na <dig>  also within this segment of dna there are two predicted class iia chain-encoding gene fragments, consisting of only the alpha <dig> domain and cytoplasmic tail-encoding parts. it is therefore unlikely that this locus is functional. assuming that these gene fragments are not due to errors in the whole-genome assembly, it is evidence for a linkage of remnants of mhc-related class ii genes with the core mhc region containing the class i peptide presenting genes.

previously identified mhc2dbb and mhc2dfb genes are predicted to be located in currently unmapped contigs, na <dig> and scaffold  <dig>  however, mhc2deb  was not identified in the current assembly, and may be attributed to gaps in the sequence data or allelic or haplotypic differences. several fragmented sequences resembling class iia and/or b chain-encoding genes were also identified in contigs na <dig> and na <dig>  and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  only contig na <dig> harbours putative complete class iia and class iib genes. another gene found in this  <dig> kb contig resembles mhc2ddb, consisting of exons  <dig> and  <dig> only.

the two tap transporters in human, namely tap <dig> and tap <dig>  are both located in the mhc class ii region, and are closely linked to genes encoding the proteasome subunits and the class ii molecules. in zebrafish, however, a tap1-like sequence is found on chromosomes  <dig> and three tap2-like genes are found in the class i region  <cit>  on chromosome  <dig>  the latter, named abcb <dig>  abcb3l <dig>  abcb3l <dig>  form part of the zebrafish core mhc region. the trout tap <dig> gene is not linked to the major class ia region either  <cit> . likewise, in fugu, the tap <dig> gene is found on an isolated scaffold that is not linked to the main class i region  <cit> .

analysis of the mhc class iii region in zebrafish
the human class iii is the most gene dense region within the mhc containing few or no pseudogenes. unlike the class i and class ii loci that are evolutionary and functionally related  <cit> , the class iii region genes are not. the class iii, however, include immune-related genes such as those encoding complement components, tumour necrosis factors and heat shock proteins. the search for the mhc class iii region in zebrafish was first initiated by the identification of the bf/c <dig> gene using degenerate pcr  <cit> . this was then followed by the identification of several, but not all, of the zebrafish homologues of the human mhc class iii region genes  <cit> .

in the zebrafish, the mhc class iii genes are found distributed throughout their genome . several zebrafish genes  map to chromosome  <dig>  which also encompasses the largest stretch of mhc-related genes. two other unmapped scaffolds also harbour several class iii genes: neu <dig>  zgc: <dig>  bat <dig>  zbtb <dig> are found in na17767; and bf/c <dig>  rdbp, hsp <dig>  skiv2l are in scaffold na <dig>  these are syntenic to the human mhc class iii region with the conservation of both gene order and content .

approximately half of the human mhc class iii region genes were not identified in the zebrafish assembly. among these were the ly <dig> family members, which may therefore be mammalian-specific. alternatively, being involved in the immune response, ly <dig> genes evolved more rapidly than others, and might have diverged sufficiently to not be recognised by sequence similarity searches. for eight human genes, atp6v1g <dig>  aif <dig>  clic <dig>  crebl <dig>  ddah <dig>  agpat <dig>  pbx <dig> and notch <dig>  the paralogues but not the orthologues of the genes in the human mhc class iii region have been identified by sequence similarity in zebrafish. this observation extends to ier <dig>  ring <dig> and b3galt <dig> found in the class i and extended class ii regions. the presence or absence of other genes may be attributed to lineage-specific evolution. for example, lamprey  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit>  and medaka  <cit>  possess genes equally similar to both mammalian bf and c <dig>  while a xenopus clone has clearly been identified as encompassing bf. this bf/c <dig> ancestral gene has further duplicated in zebrafish  <cit> , copies of which were identified on chromosome  <dig> and contig na <dig>  similarly, a recent survey of hsp <dig> genes in xiphophorus maculates   <cit>  has revealed that a single hsp <dig> gene gave rise to four distinct groups of genes: mammalian testis-specific hst <dig>  mammalian mhc-linked hsp <dig>  mammalian hsp70b' and the fish hsp <dig>  human class iii hspa1a, hspa1b and hspa1l genes are intronless and encode identical or near-identical proteins. intronless zebrafish hsp <dig> genes were identified on chromosome  <dig> and scaffold na <dig>  three additional copies of hsp70-like genes were identified on chromosome  <dig>  although these contained one, two or three introns in the 3' end of their sequence. the identified zebrafish genes cluster phylogenetically within the fish subgroup, apart from the sequence on scaffold na <dig>  which appears to be similar to the mammalian mhc-linked heat shock protein sequences .

construction of in-silico gene maps
the zebrafish mhc gene map  was constructed using primarily mapping information from the whole-genome assembly displayed in the ensembl platform. the position of at least  <dig> genes mapped in this survey could be verified by comparison to experimental data stored in the zfin database, which also yielded information for genes residing in unmapped contigs. mapping data from these two sources did not coincide for several genes, including bat <dig>  clica, vars <dig>  c <dig>  pou5f <dig>  rgl <dig>  tubb <dig>  ddx <dig>  col11a <dig>  pbx1a, and stk19-like. these discrepencies may be attributed to the high levels of polymorphisms and regions of misassembly caused by the source dna used for the whole-genome assembly being collected from over  <dig> embryos. until the genome sequence is complete, it will not be possible to accurately predict the position and number of all human mhc orthologues in zebrafish. there are also a number of genes, notably cd <dig>  mog and hfe, that could not be identified in the draft assembly used here .

there were a number of difficulties associated with assessing the degree of synteny between the zebrafish whole-genome assembly and the human mhc. although blast is a heavily used analysis tool for identifying related sequences, it does not discriminate between large gene family members. to maximise the identification of mhc-related loci in zebrafish, only the highest blast scoring sequences were chosen for further analysis , and searches were conducted using blastp or tblastx. orthology can be confirmed by obtaining mapping data of surrounding genes, with the assumption that groups of syntenic genes would remain in close proximity through evolution, and therefore be maintained in similar segments of dna. the physical linkage between numerous mhc-related loci is apparent on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  genes mapping to zebrafish chromosome  <dig> have also been observed to be syntenic with human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . gene blocks, in particular present in contig na <dig> and na <dig>  map closely together in the human mhc class iii region. this criterion is more difficult to apply when genes are dispersed, as seen in figure  <dig>  the ensembl platform  <cit>  used to map the mhc in zebrafish provides a combination of alignment data, genomic location, detailed transcript structures to compare functional domains of orthologous proteins, in conjunction with multi-species comparisons. in combination with further phylogenetic analyses when duplicates of one gene were identified, the distinction between orthologues and paralogues was ascertained. nevertheless, it is very difficult to assign orthologous comparative relationships with multigene families until all members of the family have been sequenced in both organisms. this might be the case in human, but the zebrafish genome is yet to be completed.

duplicated genes and mhc paralagous regions
in human, it was observed that four regions, the mhc on 6p <dig>  as well as 9q33â€“q <dig>  1q21â€“q25/1p11â€“p <dig> and 19p <dig> â€“p <dig>  are paralogous regions  <cit>  that share members of the same gene family. further analysis has shown that paralogues of human mhc genes are also scattered essentially over all chromosomes  <cit> . likewise, genome-wide duplications have recently been examined in zebrafish  <cit> , confirming that an extra round of a whole-genome duplication event occurred early in the teleost lineage after it split from the tetrapod lineage. evidence that paralogous genes exist in zebrafish became apparent when many duplicates associated with the mhc, and mainly the class iii region, were identified . here we discuss five mhc-encoded gene families in more detail.

the notch gene family members encode evolutionary transmembrane receptors that regulate cell fate determination. four notch paralogues  have been identified in human, and only three of their orthologues are found in zebrafish . the orthologue of human notch <dig>  found in the mhc, is absent in the fish whole-genome assembly, indicative that gene loss has followed the block duplication events in teleosts. this is also seen in fugu  <cit>  and may be due to it being the most divergent member of the notch family  <cit> . two duplicates of notch <dig> are found in scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  until the assembly is complete, it is not clear whether there are two copies of this gene or if this is due to the status of the current assembly. only one surrounding rdh8-like sequence is found in common between the two scaffolds. in addition, notch <dig> and notch <dig> have been mapped to chromosome  <dig> and contig na <dig> 

retinoid receptors are soluble nuclear proteins belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcriptional regulators. the rxr subfamily consists of three polypeptide chains, namely alpha, beta and gamma, encoded by separate loci. the human rxrb gene is found within the mhc, while the rxra and rxrg paralogues are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. five rxr loci have been identified in the zebrafish assembly in contig na <dig> and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two semi-orthologues of human rxrb appear to have arisen from a fish-specific duplication, and duplicates of rxra are also present in the zebrafish genome. mapping data from the current assembly in comparison to the zfin linkage maps are contradictory and may highlight problems in both approaches to mapping genes. interestingly, neither of the rxrb sequences map to chromosome  <dig> in the zv <dig> whole-genome assembly as originally thought  <cit> .

the human pbx <dig> gene encodes a homeodomain-containing protein. three paralogues are located within chromosomes 1q <dig>  9q <dig> and 19p <dig>  named pbx <dig>  pbx <dig> and pbx <dig>  respectively. four pbx-like sequences were identified in the zebrafish: pbx1a on scaffold na <dig> and chromosome 11; pbx3b on chromosome 18; and pbxy on scaffold na <dig>  these are related to human pbx <dig>  pbx <dig> and pbx <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the orthologous sequence to human pbx <dig>  which is present in the mhc, has not been identified in the current assembly.

the complement component c <dig> gene encodes a protein that plays a central role in the innate immune response. structurally, c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> belong to the Î± <dig> macroglobulin  protein family and are derived from a single common ancestor. in human, they are found on four different chromosomes: 6p <dig> , 9q <dig> , 19p <dig>  and 12p <dig> , and a similar situation exists in all tetrapods studied to date. in zebrafish, the a2m and c <dig> genes are both found on chromosome  <dig> as previously shown  <cit> . multiple copies of a2m have also been observed in zebrafish with a duplicate being present in na <dig>  two copies of the c <dig> gene were identified on chromosome  <dig> and na <dig> 

six members of the chloride intracellular channel  gene family  have been described in humans. they are involved in chloride ion transport within various subcellular compartments  <cit> . four clic genes were identified in zebrafish on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  on phylogenetic analysis, they cluster with mammalian clic <dig>  clic <dig>  clic <dig> and clic <dig> genes, respectively. the orthologue of the human mhc-embedded clic <dig> was not found.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomics reveals that the organisation of the mhc in more distantly-related organisms varies from the human model  <cit> . teleost fish are particularly unusual in their organisation in comparison to mammals, chicken, xenopus and shark in that their class i and class ii loci are found on different chromosomes  <cit> . the core class i region in zebrafish, medaka, fugu and rainbow trout  <cit>  comprises genes involved in class i peptide presentation and processing: the classical class i molecules, the immunoproteasome subunits, atp-binding cassette transporters and tapasin. the whole-genome shotgun data for zebrafish has allowed a genome-wide analysis of major histocompatibility genes and their paralogues, and highlights that one or more copies exist of mhc-related genes in fish as in humans. the results obtained thus far extend the linkage information regarding major histocompatibility genes on chromosome  <dig> in zebrafish and the classical mammalian mhc, and further supports previous findings that the functional class ii loci are found on a different chromosome. the distribution of the remaining mhc-related genes and their paralogues is genome-wide, confirming a fragmented mhc in fish.
