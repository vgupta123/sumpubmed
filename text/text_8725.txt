BACKGROUND
most pharmacological or toxicological assays and bioartificial liver support systems require fully differentiated hepatocytes. the availability of mature human hepatocytes is variable and the numbers low, because they are usually isolated from donor livers not suitable for transplantation. in addition these cells hardly proliferate in vitro  <cit> . since mature human hepatocytes cannot be used for large-scale applications, there is a pressing need for a cell line that combines highly differentiated hepatic functions while maintaining adequate proliferation capacity.

several cell lines derived from human liver tumours, such as the hepatoma cell line hepg <dig>  <cit> , as well as in vitro immortalized cell lines, like the nknt- <dig> cell line, have been investigated  <cit> . in general, these cell lines proliferate adequately, but the levels of hepatocyte-specific functions  remain disappointedly low.

in tumour-derived cell lines, the mutations leading to immortalization are largely unknown. in an attempt to control the immortalization process and therefore prevent at least part of the dedifferentiation process, several immortalized cell lines have been developed. however, although certain genetic modifications in immortalized cell lines are known, spontaneous mutations contributing to the immortalization cannot be excluded.

for successful in vitro immortalization, overexpression of cell cycle stimulating genes is generally required. due to the low proliferation capacity of mature hepatocytes, strong stimulation of cell cycle progression is necessary for immortalization. in the majority of in vitro immortalizations of primary human liver cells, the gene encoding simian virus  <dig> large t antigen , an inhibitor of the cell cycle inhibitors p <dig> and the retinoblastoma protein, has been used  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of cyclin d <dig>  which stimulates cell cycle progression, and dominant negative mutants of p <dig> have also led to successful immortalization  <cit> . in some immortalized cell lines, proliferation was combined with stabilisation of the telomeres  <cit> . critically short telomeres induce a terminal state of growth arrest called crisis  <cit> . overexpression of the reverse transcriptase of telomerase, htert, stabilizes telomere length, thereby avoiding cellular crisis. as a general principle immortalization by overexpression of htert only, minimises the reduction in functionality  <cit> .

in contrast to mature human hepatocytes, fetal human hepatocytes have the ability to proliferate in vitro  <cit>  and thereby can be immortalized without cell cycle stimulation. in addition, telomere stabilisation in itself can immortalize these cells  <cit> . wege et al showed that the immortalization of fetal human hepatocytes did not affect their differentiation potential, however, the functionality of the immortalized cells was not compared with mature human hepatocytes. such comparison is essential to establish the suitability of these cells for hepatocyte applications in vitro. furthermore phenotypical stability of these cells may be low, since these were not of clonal origin. in our previous report we demonstrated that primary human fetal liver cells  in culture exhibit albumin production rates and hepatocyte specific mrna levels comparable to those of primary mature human hepatocytes in vitro  <cit> . however, after eight population doublings most of these functions were decreased to less than 1% of the corresponding function of primary human hepatocytes in vitro. this functional loss can be, at least partly, attributed to the presence of non-parenchymal cells in the cell preparation, which eventually outnumber the functional hepatocytes. therefore, selection of functional cell clones is necessary if hflcs are extensively expanded in vitro.

in a previous study we already isolated hflcs and selected specific clones based on their morphology and growth potential  <cit> . this study combines the telomerase based immortalization technique with the selection of functional hflcs to obtain new hepatic cell lines. the resulting immortalized cell line was tested for hepatic functionality in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro functionality was compared with other well-known hepatic cell lines, more specifically the conditionally immortalized nknt- <dig>  <cit>  and the tumour derived hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . to test whether the resulted novel immortalized cell line had the ability to differentiate into functional hepatocytes, the cell line was transplanted into the spleen of immunodeficient mice.

methods
cell isolation and culture
human fetal livers were obtained from elective abortions. gestational age was determined by ultrasonic measurement of the diameter of the skull and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks. the use of this tissue was approved by the medical ethical committee of the academic medical center, amsterdam, the netherlands, subject to informed patient consent in compliance with the helsinki declaration. we isolated hflcs on three independent occasions; in each case four fetal livers were pooled. cells were isolated as described previously  <cit> . hflcs were seeded in dmem culture medium  containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> mm l-glutamine ,  <dig> μm dexamethason ,  <dig> μg/ml insulin,  <dig>  μg/ml transferrin,  <dig>  ng/ml selenium-x ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin  at a density of approximately 3* <dig> cells/cm <dig> in primaria 6-well plates . clonal derivatives were obtained by limiting dilution. the selection procedure used and the functionality of the clonal derivatives are described elsewhere  <cit> . near-confluent cultures were detached by  <dig> min incubation with  <dig> % trypsin/ <dig> % edta  and split at 1: <dig> ratios. the number of population doublings  was calculated as pd = log /log  <dig>  in which nf is the final number of cells harvested and ni is the number of cells initially seeded. no corrections were made for cells that did not re-attach after passaging, since their proportion was negligible. the period in which pd number progressed linear with culture time was used to calculate the pd time .

mature primary human hepatocytes were isolated from seven patients undergoing partial hepatectomy, because of metastatic carcinoma. the tumour free liver tissue used in each case for the hepatocyte isolation ranged between  <dig> to  <dig> grams. the procedure was approved by the medical ethical committee of the academic medical center subject to informed patient consent. the hepatocyte isolation method was adapted from the protocol described by seglen  <cit>  as previously described  <cit> .

nknt- <dig> cells were kindly donated by prof. i. fox, university of nebraska, usa. the nknt- <dig> cells were cultured on primaria 6-well culture plates  and in  <dig> cm <dig> culture flasks using cs-c complete serum free medium  with  <dig>  mg/ml hygromycin b  and  <dig> u/ml penicillin/streptomycin . cultures were passaged with a split ratio of 1: <dig> according to instructions for cs-c medium. cre-mediated recombination to revert immortalization of nknt- <dig> cells  <cit>  was carried out by transduction of the adenoviral vector axcancre  as described previously  <cit> . we analysed both reverted, hence transduced with axcancre and selected with g <dig>  and unreverted i.e. untreated cells. hepg <dig> cells were obtained from atcc  and cultured in primaria tissue culture flasks in dmem culture medium as described above for hflcs.

all cultures were maintained at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere  and the medium was changed every 2- <dig> days.

introduction of htert and green fluorescent protein genes
the cdna of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase  gene, kindly provided by r.l. beijersbergen, netherlands cancer institute, the netherlands, was introduced in the cells by lentiviral transduction. the lentiviral vector backbone was described as ltrcmvr <dig> by marcusic et al.  <cit> . the lentiviral vector contained a cytomegalovirus promoter controlling the expression of a reverse tetracycline  responsive transcriptional activator and a tet responsive element controlling the expression of the htert gene. in this system htert transcription can be increased by adding  <dig> μg/ml doxycyclin to the medium.

the lentivirus was produced as previously described  <cit> . in brief, hek293t cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a third generation lentiviral vector system. virus containing supernatant was collected at  <dig> and  <dig> hours following transfection, filtered through  <dig>  μm millipore filters, then 100-fold concentrated by centrifugation and added to the culture medium of the hflcs in 24-well culture plates in a 1: <dig>  ratio. the htert lentivirus was introduced in three independent hflc cultures and in five clonal derivatives, i.e. cbal <dig>  cbal <dig>  cbal <dig>  cbal <dig> and cbal <dig>  cells were passaged twice before integration of the lentiviral vector was confirmed by pcr using genomic dna of transduced cells as template.

in the transplantation experiment cbal <dig> cells were marked with green fluorescent protein  by transduction using lentiviral construct prrlcpptpgkgfppressin  <cit>  carrying the gfp gene under control of a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. by fluorescence-activated cell sorting it was demonstrated that ≥ 95% of the transduced cells were gfp positive. there were at least five passages between transduction with gfp and transplantation of the cells. the gfp positivity, ratio as well as expression level, of the cells remained unchanged during passaging.

flow cytometry
the cbal <dig> cells, cultured for  <dig> days, were analyzed for progenitor cell markers by flow cytometry. for comparison hepg <dig> cells were included in the experiment. the cells were detached using accutase , washed twice in dmem culture medium, resuspended in  <dig> μl dmem and incubated for  <dig> minutes on ice in the dark with  <dig> μl of the following antibodies:  <dig>  a combination of mouse-anti human cd34-fitc and mouse-anti human cd <dig> -apc ;  <dig>  a combination of mouse-anti human cd146-fitc  and mouse-anti human cd <dig> -apc;  <dig>  mouse-anti human cd <dig> . the cells incubated with the cd <dig> antibodies were washed in culture medium and subsequently incubated with the secondary antibody goat-anti mouse igg-alexa fluor  <dig> . as negative controls, cells were incubated with either a combination of mouse igg2a-apc and mouse igg1-fitc   or with goat-anti mouse igg-alexa fluor  <dig>  the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using bd facscalibur  and data were analyzed with winmdi  <dig>  software.

hepatocyte function tests
hepatocyte function tests were performed at confluence in 6-well plates. after washing the cells twice with phosphate buffered saline  culture medium was replaced by  <dig>  ml of test medium ,  <dig> mm ornithine ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin,  <dig>  mm nh4cl,  <dig>  mm d-galactose ,  <dig> μm lidocaine hcl . medium samples were taken after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of incubation. the cells were then washed twice with pbs and stored at -20°c for protein determination.

biochemical assays
urea concentrations were determined using the blood urea nitrogen test . albumin concentrations were determined via enzyme linked immunosorbent assays using cross-absorbed goat-anti-human albumin antibodies . lidocaine concentrations were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay using a tdxflx analyzer . galactose concentrations were determined by the absorbance of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide  at  <dig> nm after enzymatic reaction with galactose dehydrogenase . total protein/well was quantified by spectrometry using coomassie blue . production rates were established by calculating the changes in concentration during time and corrected for protein content.

rt-pcr
rna was isolated from the cell lines by using trizol . as a reference, human liver samples were included in the analyses. first strand cdna was generated from  <dig> ng of total rna using  <dig> pmol of gene-specific rt primers specific for the mrna of albumin, α-1-antitrypsin , transferrin, hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig> α , alpha-fetoprotein , π class glutathione s transferase  and htert in combination with  <dig> pmol of rt primer for 18s ribosomal rna and  <dig> units superscript iii . real-time reverse transcription pcr  using sybr green i  was performed as described previously  <cit> . the sequences of the rt and pcr primers and pcr conditions are given in table  <dig> 

sequences of the primers used in reverse transcriptase  reaction or during real-time pcr reaction  and the conditions used in the real-time pcr reactions. na = not applicable.

starting levels of mrna, except for htert, were calculated by analyzing linear regression on the log  per cycle number data using linregpcr software  <cit> . starting levels of htert mrna were calculated by standard curve analysis, using serial dilutions of htert containing plasmid ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> copies/reaction and lightcycler software . the mrna starting levels of albumin, aat, transferrin, afp, gst π, and htert were normalised for the starting levels of 18s ribosomal rna. normalised mrna levels, except for htert mrna levels, are expressed as a percentage of the mean mrna starting levels of the two liver samples normalised for 18s ribosomal rna starting levels.

immunocytochemistry
for the detection of glutamine synthetase , cbal <dig> cells were cultured on 8-wells culture-slides  for two days. then the cells were washed twice with pbs and fixed by a 10-minutes incubation with ice-cold methanol-aceton-water mixture . cells were incubated with 70% ethanol for  <dig> minutes, washed with pbs and subsequently incubated overnight with monoclonal gs antibody  diluted 1: <dig>  antibody binding was visualized with the indirect unlabelled antibody peroxidase anti-peroxidase  method  <cit> .

for the detection of albumin, cytokeratin   <dig> and ck <dig>  cbal <dig> cells were seeded on immunoslides  and cultured for two and  <dig> days. cells were washed once in pbs with  <dig> % tween- <dig> and fixated in 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. cells were washed as before and incubated with a blocking buffer , 2%fcs) for one hour at room temperature. after a further washing step, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody for one hour at room temperature. as primary antibodies we used anti-albumin antibody , mouse-anti-human ck <dig>  and mouse-anti-human ck <dig>  for detection of albumin, ck <dig> and ck <dig>  respectively. cells were washed again as before and incubated with  <dig> μg/ml cy <dig> conjugated goat-anti-mouse igg and  <dig> μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate  conjugated phalloidin for  <dig> hour in a humidified chamber at room temperature. forty minutes before the end of this incubation period,  <dig> ng/ml diamidinophenylindoldiacetate  was added. cells were washed again as before and embedded in polymount  and covered with a coverslip. slides were analysed using an axiovert  <dig> fluorescence microscope.

the cbal <dig> cells overexpressing gfp were transplanted into four  <dig> week old rag2-/-γc-/- mice  <cit> . the mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ffm mixture . one million gfp-marked cbal <dig> cells suspended in  <dig> μl hbss were injected into the inferior tip of the spleen as described  <cit> . at both nine and  <dig> days after transplantation, two mice were sacrificed. the livers and spleens were harvested after in vivo fixation. for in vivo fixation, mice were anesthetized as described above and  <dig> ml pbs was flushed trough the circulation, followed by  <dig> ml 2% paraformaldehyde  in pbs. subsequently, liver and spleen were harvested and cut into pieces of approximately  <dig>  cm <dig>  the tissue pieces were incubated in 4% pfa in pbs for four hours, followed by an overnight incubation in 30% sucrose solution. tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°c.

RESULTS
human tert introduction in hflcs and clonal derivatives
the maximum number of pds between the hflc preparations and clonal derivatives were different. expression of htert was detected in some of the clonal derivatives analysed, however, all hflcs and clonal derivatives eventually entered a state of terminal growth arrest .

life span is indicated as the maximum number of population doublings .

after lentiviral introduction of the htert gene, the presence of the htert cdna was confirmed in hflcs and clonal derivatives by pcr on genomic dna . however, the hflc cultures did not overcome the terminal growth arrest after the introduction of the htert gene; only one of the hflc cultures' lifespan was extended by 30%. in addition, only one of the clonal derivatives was able to overcome the terminal growth arrest after the introduction of htert. this clone, cbal <dig>  previously showed the longest life span of  <dig> pds and a relatively high endogenous htert expression . because the transduced cell line was capable of more than  <dig> pds, which is twice the life span of the parental cell line cbal <dig>  and still did not show any sign of growth arrest, we considered this cell line to be immortalized and named it cbal <dig>  the htert mrna levels of cbal <dig> were  <dig> × 105-fold higher as compared to its parental cell line cbal <dig> .

characterisation of cbal <dig> in vitro
the organisation of the cbal <dig> cell layer changed during culturing; the cells displayed a cubic shape at day  <dig>  instead of the more spindle shape at day  <dig> . the cbal <dig> cultures were 100% positive for the hepatocyte markers gs, ck  <dig> and albumin as well as the cholangiocyte marker ck  <dig> at day  <dig> and day  <dig> after seeding . the ck <dig> staining was predominantly around the nucleus reaching into the cytoplasm, which is similar to the ck <dig> staining of primary human hepatocytes that are dedifferentiating in vitro  <cit> . these data suggest that under these conditions the cbal <dig> cells resemble cells with progenitor characteristics rather than fully differentiated hepatocytes.

the  <dig> day-cultured cbal <dig> cells and, for comparison, hepatoblastoma derived hepg <dig> cells were characterized for three progenitor cell markers by flow cytometry, i.e. cd <dig>  a marker for various cells including mesenchymal progenitor cells and hepatocytes during liver regeneration  <cit> , cd <dig> , an epithelial marker upregulated in gastrointestinal carcinomas  <cit>  and cd <dig>  a marker for progenitor cells of various origins, like endothelial cells, haematopoietic cells and neural cells  <cit> . the cbal <dig> cells were positive for cd <dig>  but negative for cd <dig>   and cd <dig> . hepg <dig> cells were also negative for cd <dig> , but, in contrast to the cbal <dig> cells, positive for cd <dig> and negative for cd <dig> .

because the immunostainings suggested a transition in the organisation of the cell layer of cbal <dig> cells, we tested their in vitro functionality at  <dig> days of culture, when the cells displayed a spindle like morphology and the culture was not confluent and at day  <dig>  when cells were more cubic and confluence was reached. there was a trend of increased expression of markers for mature hepatocytes  with culture time and decreased expression of markers for immature hepatocytes  . the in vitro functionality of cbal <dig> after reaching confluence was comparable with that of cbal <dig>  particularly at day 15; no significant difference was detected between cbal <dig> and cbal <dig> at day  <dig> for urea and albumin production and the mrna levels of albumin, aat, transferrin, gstπ and afp differed less than  <dig> -fold . so, the immortalization of cbal <dig> maintained the investigated hepatic functions. further extension of the culture period did not clearly increase hepatic functionality .

to investigate the putative tumorigenicity of cbal <dig>  the cells were seeded in soft agar. the cbal <dig> cells were not able to form colonies in soft agar, where hepg <dig> as positive control, formed  <dig> ±  <dig> colonies from  <dig> cells. the inability of cbal <dig> cells to grow in an anchorage independent way, is an indication that cbal <dig> cells are not tumorigenic.

comparison of cbal <dig> with other hepatic cell lines and mature hepatocytes
the novel in vitro immortalized fetal hepatocyte cell line cbal <dig> was subsequently compared with hepg <dig> cells, the conditionally immortalized hepatocyte cell line nknt- <dig> and primary  human hepatocytes two days after seeding. the primary human hepatocytes did not exhibit any decline in the tested functions within two days . hepg <dig>  cbal <dig> at day  <dig> and nknt- <dig> cells, both un-reverted and reverted for immortalization, synthesized urea, at a level 11- <dig> fold lower than mature hepatocytes . the hepg <dig> cells and to a lesser extent the cbal <dig> cells produced albumin in contrast to nknt- <dig> cells. the galactose elimination of the cbal <dig> cells at day  <dig> reached to 19% of the levels of the mature hepatocytes. the cbal <dig> cells, like fetal hepatocytes, did not eliminate lidocaine, a marker for cytochrome p <dig> 1a <dig> and 3a <dig> activity, whereas the mature hepatocytes eliminated  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/h/mg protein.

in cbal <dig> and nknt- <dig> cells, the mrna levels of albumin, aat and transferrin,  were less than 1% of the corresponding levels in human liver. however, the transcript levels of hnf4α, a master regulator of liver development, increased up to 17% of the human liver levels in the cbal <dig> cells at day  <dig>  hepg <dig> cells showed mrna levels for albumin, aat and transferrin that were comparable to human liver. as markers associated with immature hepatocytes, afp mrna levels of cbal <dig> and nknt- <dig> cells were comparable to the in vivo level, while the gst π mrna levels were 10- <dig> times higher. in hepg <dig> cells, mrna levels for afp were 1000-fold higher than the in vivo levels and gst π levels were undetectable. in summary cbal <dig> at day  <dig> was positive for all tested hepatocyte parameters, whereas hepg <dig> and nknt- <dig> cells both lacked one function.

cbal <dig> cells differentiate into functional hepatocytes in murine liver
to determine whether cbal <dig> cells have the potential for hepatic differentiation, the cells were marked with gfp by lentiviral transduction and transplanted in the spleen of  <dig> immunodeficient mice. nine and  <dig> days after transplantation, gfp expressing cells were detected in the murine spleen  and liver . the presence of gfp positive cells in the murine livers was relatively low , since no liver repopulation model was applied, and remained stable between nine and  <dig> days. the cells appeared as single cells and no cell clusters were detected, which again suggested a lack of tumorigenicity.

the majority of these cells exhibited an elongated morphology, however a small number of cells  had the morphological characteristics of hepatocytes, given their cuboid appearance. no differences were observed between the livers harvested at nine and  <dig> days after transplantation. the gfp positive cells were confirmed to be from human origin by immunohistochemistry using a human specific antibody binding to mitochondria . immunohistochemistry using an antibody against vimentin, a marker for dedifferentiated and mesenchymal cells  <cit> , indicated a high expression in cbal <dig> in vitro  and in all the elongated cbal <dig> cells found in the mouse liver, whereas the cbal <dig> cells with cuboid appearance did not or hardly expressed vimentin . furthermore these gfp positive hepatocyte-looking cells with cuboid morphology were indistinguishable from the surrounding mice hepatocytes with regards to cps expression, which is expressed periportally  <cit>  . in contrast, elongated cbal <dig> cells did not express cps. gs expression, which is present in vitro , was absent in the transplanted cells in the periportal areas . no gfp positive cells were detected in pericentral areas, the site of gs expression in normal liver. a possible explanation for this is that the cells may have entered the liver via the portal vein and engrafted before reaching the pericentral area. finally, the cuboid gfp positive cells stained positive for human albumin , whereas the elongated gfp positive cells were negative .

we then tested whether the gfp positive hepatocytes were the result of fusion between human cbal <dig> cells and murine hepatocytes  <cit> , by using fish analysis. the results showed that nuclei reacting to the human probe  were negative for the murine probe . from the shape of the nuclei and the localization of cells, we concluded that these were cbal <dig> derived hepatocytes.

discussion
in this report we present a novel, clonal, immortalized human fetal liver cell line, cbal <dig>  that displays hepatocyte-specific functions. in vitro, the cbal <dig> cell line produced albumin and urea and expressed hepatocyte-specific genes. however, the levels of the hepatic functions showed considerable variation compared with primary mature hepatocytes. moreover, the cbal <dig> cells expressed immature markers cd <dig>  cytokeratin  <dig> and glutathione s transferase π, but did not show any evidence of growth in soft agar. in vivo, when cbal <dig> was transplanted in immunodeficient mice, the cell line showed the potential to fully differentiate into hepatocytes and adapt the zonal expression pattern of cps.

human fetal liver cells have been immortalised by telomerase activation before  <cit> , but this is the first report in which this immortalisation strategy was combined with a cloning procedure. in contrast to wege et al. we could not immortalise unselected hflc preparations  <cit> , although we were able to extend the life span of the cells by about 30%. in our study we selected cells with cuboid morphology from the initial cell preparation and of these selected cells only the cell line with the highest proliferation capacity, cbal <dig>  became immortal by overexpression of htert. the reduced ability of immortalization in the present study may be the result of differences in transduction levels observed in the two studies. wege et al used a constitutively active moloney murine leukemia promoter to drive htert expression  <cit> ; we used a tetracycline inducible expression system, stimulated with  <dig> μm doxycyclin, to drive htert expression. because moloney murine leukaemia vectors are prone to transduce rapidly dividing cells, this might have resulted in the selection of cells prone to immortalization.

our results are in line with the conclusion of wege et al that telomerase-induced immortalization of hflcs does not affect their differentiation potential  <cit> . after immortalisation, cbal <dig> was capable of reaching urea and albumin production rates and the hepatocyte specific mrna levels comparable to the levels of cbal <dig>  however, cbal <dig> needs prolonged cultivation time to produce albumin and urea. in addition, galactose elimination increased after prolonged culturing. this may be related to the increased transcript levels of hnf4α, a key regulator of hepatocyte development and function  <cit> .

furthermore, we found no indications that cbal <dig> was malignantly transformed; cbal <dig> was not able to form colonies in soft agar and no tumours were found in immunodeficient mice  <dig> days after transplantation. we conclude that telomerase reconstitution can immortalize fetal human hepatocytes without loss of function and without indications of malignant transformation.

to our knowledge this is the first time that a htert-immortalized human fetal liver cell line was evaluated for hepatic function in vitro. the clonal origin of the cell line is most important for preservation of the phenotype during long-term culturing. the stability in phenotype was previously shown for cbal <dig>  <cit> . this is in contrast to cultures of hepatocyte isolates from mature or fetal origin, either immortalized or not.

in addition to the description of cbal <dig>  we compared its functionality with that of mature human hepatocytes kept under the same culture conditions. it is rather surprising that such comparison is rarely seen in similar studies describing hepatic cell lines. mature hepatocytes are currently the only cells that meet the criteria for in vitro applications and therefore are the gold standard when evaluating alternative hepatic cell lines. the performance of our novel hepatocyte line cbal <dig> was also compared with two well-known and widely used hepatic cell lines, nknt- <dig>  <cit>  and hepg <dig>  <cit> . admittedly all three cell lines, performed considerably less well compared with primary mature human hepatocytes in all the liver parameters tested in this study. nknt- <dig> cell did not produce detectable levels of albumin; hepg <dig> cells lacked detectable gst π expression. in concordance with the low level of hepatic differentiation, relatively high mrna levels of afp and particularly gst π were observed in cbal <dig>  moreover the cbal <dig> cells expressed ck <dig>  a marker for cholangiocytes, and in addition ck <dig>  a marker for hepatocytes, in a pattern characteristic of de-differentiated human hepatocytes. finally, the cbal <dig> cells expressed cd <dig>  a marker of various cells, including mesenchymal progenitor cells  <cit> , therefore it can be concluded that cbal <dig> cells are not fully differentiated in vitro into mature hepatocytes, but rather should be regarded as a progenitor liver cell line that has the full potential to differentiate into hepatocytes. these cells may derive from mesodermal cells, as also suggested for multipotent progenitor cells previously isolated from human fetal liver  <cit> .

interestingly, hepg <dig> and cbal <dig> showed contrasting expression patterns of cd <dig> and cd <dig>  both membrane glycoproteins are expressed on progenitor cells. however, cd <dig> is heavily upregulated in premalignant hepatic tissues and hepatocellular carcinomas and a marker for tumor-initiating stem cells, in contrast to cd <dig>  <cit> . expression of cd <dig> is low in mature hepatocytes, but is upregulated in the termination phase of liver regeneration and in primary hepatocytes in the presence of transforming growth factor -β <dig>  these observations underline the non-transformed phenotype of cbal <dig> cells in contrast to hepg <dig> cells.

the liver provides an optimal environment for hepatic differentiation of cbal <dig>  when cbal <dig> cells were labelled with gfp and transplanted into the spleen of immunodeficient mice the cells migrated to the liver. this was already shown with human fetal hepatocytes, both immortalized and freshly isolated  <cit> . however, in this study we showed that following engraftment a number of these cells went to become hepatocytes morphologically indistinguishable from murine hepatocytes. these cells had very low or no expression of vimentin, a marker for mesenchymal cells and for the undifferentiated cbal <dig> cells. in addition, the cuboid cells expressed human albumin and adapted the zonal expression pattern of cps and gs characteristic for the surrounding cells  <cit> . with fish analysis, we excluded the possibility that these gfp positive hepatocytes were the result of fusion between gfp labelled cbal <dig> cells and murine hepatocytes. fusion between host liver cells and transplanted stem cells, specifically haematopoietic stem cells, has been widely reported to account for high rates of transdifferentiation  <cit> . our experiments confirm that the cbal <dig> line is able to differentiate into hepatocytes when the right differentiation stimuli are present.

however, the fact that a significant number of the transplanted cells did not adapt the hepatocyte morphology and expressed high levels of vimentin, but no human albumin, suggests that either not all cbal <dig> cells were equally sensitive to differentiation stimuli, despite the clonal origin of the cells, or that not all cells were exposed to the same levels of differentiation stimuli due to micro-environmental variations. this requires further investigation.

very recently we have tested the cbal <dig> cells in the amc-bioartificial liver , which is a bioreactor, more suitable for hepatocyte culturing than monolayer culturing  <cit> . we showed that the cbal <dig> cells eliminated ammonia and galactose at a rate up to 49% and 90% of that of primary porcine hepatocytes in the amc-bal, respectively. other functions, like albumin production and lidocaine elimination only reached 6% and  <dig> % of the levels of primary porcine hepatocytes in the amc-bal. this further underlines that the cbal <dig> cells are indeed hepatocyte-like cells which probably need further stimulation of hepatic differentiation for in vitro applications.

CONCLUSIONS
the development of a cell line that combines both in vitro hepatic function and proliferation capacity is important for large-scale applications that depend on in vitro hepatic functionality. in this study we present evidence of a novel cell line cbal <dig>  which is a telomerase immortalized fetal human hepatocyte cell line capable to differentiate into mature hepatocytes in vivo. the potential of this novel cell line merits further investigation. the challenge is to define the best possible experimental conditions in vitro to mimic as closely as possible the differentiation stimuli present in vivo aiming to achieve a high degree of differentiation into mature hepatocytes in vitro.
