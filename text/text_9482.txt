BACKGROUND
the muscle z disc connects actin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres and is essential for force transmission and muscle integrity . the main actin cross-linking protein in the z disc is α-actinin, an antiparallel dimer. each of the α-actinin monomers is composed of an n-terminal actin binding domain, a central rod region containing four spectrin repeats, and two pairs of ef-hands at the c-terminus .

one group of α-actinin interacting z disc proteins, the pdz-lim or alp/enigma family  <cit> , is characterized by n-terminal pdz and c-terminal lim domains . of these family members, actinin-associated lim protein , the z band alternatively spliced pdz protein , enigma and enigma homology protein  are predominantly expressed in muscle  <cit> . in contrast, the c-terminal lim protein  is expressed both in muscle and non-muscle cells  <cit> , while reversion-induced lim protein  and mystique are expressed in non-muscle tissues only  <cit> . inactivation of alp and zasp/cypher genes in mice leads to cardiomyopathy and muscle dystrophy phenotypes  <cit> . in drosophila, the single alp/zasp/enigma gene is required for z disc organization and for muscle attachment  <cit> .

the pdz domains of many, if not all, of these proteins interact with the c-terminal peptide of α-actinin  <cit> . in addition, alp, zasp/cypher and clp <dig> interact with the α-actinin rod domain  <cit>  via sequences located between the pdz and lim domains, mapping close to a conserved  <dig> amino acid motif, the zm motif, found in these three proteins  <cit> . point mutations at or close to the zm motif of zasp/cypher are found in cardiomyopathy patients  <cit> , but we have been unable to detect a direct effect of these mutations on interaction with α-actinin  <cit> .

the zm motif is located in a sequence stretch of  <dig> or more residues between the pdz and lim domains of the alp, zasp/cypher and clp <dig>  designated here as the internal region. apart from the zm motif and the recently found alp-like motif  <cit> , sequence diversity in the internal region is high, and in all family members there are areas 30– <dig> amino acid in length that are predicted to be unfolded by the program foldindex  <cit> . in this study, the aim was to structurally characterize the internal region of alp and to further narrow its interaction site with the α-actinin rod region. the alp internal region was found to be essentially a random coil in solution and interaction with the α-actinin rod could increase its stabilization. furthermore, we found that a synthetic peptide covering part of the zm motif interacted directly with the α-actinin rod.

RESULTS
expression and purification of alp internal region fragments
as the internal region of alp is involved in localization of the protein and interaction with α-actinin  <cit> , it was of great interest to study the structure and function of this region in more detail. according to the smart server  <cit> , the pdz domain of human alp ends at amino acid residue  <dig> while the lim domain begins at residue  <dig>  in our previous studies  <cit> , we used the fragment containing residues 112– <dig>  but found that during purification this fragment often degraded. for this reason, we tried to find optimal protein fragments of the alp internal region and we tested several different constructs around the area that had sequence features characteristic for folded domains when predicted with servers like foldindex  <cit>   and disembl  <cit> . we found that a  <dig> residue construct  was optimally stable, and could be purified in high amounts and concentrated up to  <dig> mg/ml. sds-page analysis of this fragment revealed a single protein band of the expected molecular weight of  <dig> da . the molecular weight of alp107- <dig> was also verified by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. in gel filtration chromatography, the fragment eluted as a single peak immediately prior to the globular protein standard of  <dig>  <dig> da , suggesting that it was either a very elongated monomer, dimer or trimer.

functional tests of alp107-273
to test whether alp107- <dig> was functional, we measured the interaction of the purified protein fragment with α-actinin by surface plasmon resonance  and tested the localization of a yellow fluorescent protein  fusion protein construct in living cells. the spr measurements were made either by immobilizing alp107- <dig> on the chip, using the α-actinin rod fragments as a soluble analyte, or the other way around. a clear interaction was observed in both experimental setups  and the apparent dissociation equilibrium constants  were in the low micromolar range. when an α-actinin rod fragment consisting of four spectrin repeats  was immobilized and alp107- <dig> used as the analyte, the kd was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m. with immobilized alp107- <dig> and soluble r1-r <dig>  the kd was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m. these values are in the same range as our previous measurements that used longer alp fragments  <cit> . alp107- <dig> interacted with a shorter piece of the α-actinin rod region that contained two spectrin repeats  with an apparently higher affinity  than it did with r1-r <dig> .

the yfp-fusion construct of alp107- <dig> was expressed in u2os cells together with the α-actinin cyan fluorescent protein . in these cells, α-actinin localizes to the leading lamellipodia, to focal adhesions and to actin stress fibres. in contractile stress fibres, α-actinin exhibits a punctate pattern . alp107- <dig> co-localized with α-actinin in the stress fibres, but no co-localization was seen in either the cell edge or the focal adhesions .

taken together, the srp interaction measurements and live cell experiments using yfp fusion protein indicated that alp107- <dig> interaction with α-actinin was similar to the full length alp  <cit> .

structural characterization of alp107-273
to study the structure of alp107- <dig> we utilized circular dichroism  and nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. the cd spectrum suggested that alp107- <dig> is mostly unfolded . no features characteristic of either α-helical or β-sheet structures were seen. in comparison, the cd spectrum of alp1- <dig> showed a slight increase in β-strand content that might be attributed to the pdz domain .

the first 15n-hsqc spectrum measured in normal buffer conditions from uniformly 15n-labeled alp107- <dig> was in line with the cd measurements as it showed the collapsed spectrum characteristic of an unfolded protein . however, we were able to partially stabilize the structure by adding  <dig> mm aspartic acid ph  <dig>    <cit> . under these conditions, ihnca, hnca, hncaco, hnco, hncoca, hncacb and cbcanh spectra were acquired and used for backbone assignment  <cit> . the alp107- <dig> fragment contained  <dig> residues, of which  <dig> were prolines. all together,  <dig> of the  <dig> non-proline residues could be assigned. when the 13c chemical shift values of all assigned cα and cβ atoms were compared to the average value of the corresponding residues in random coil conformation  <cit> , no clear indications of either α helix or β sheet secondary structures were observed . thus, nmr analysis indicated that alp107- <dig> was mostly unstructured with no secondary structure.

the interaction with the α-actinin rod region could have induced some structural changes in alp107- <dig>  assessing this by titration was complicated because the complex between alp107- <dig> and the large α-actinin rod dimer of  <dig> kda was undetectable by nmr. to be able to measure the spectrum of an unbound alp107- <dig> that is in dynamic equilibrium between α-actinin bound and unbound states, we used a rather low concentration of alp107- <dig> and observed increasing levels of alp107- <dig> 15n-hsqc peaks upon addition of α-actinin . most of the peaks  could be correlated with those assigned in the presence of  <dig> mm aspartic acid. only a minor fraction of the peaks were induced by alp dilution alone . the nmr titration studies suggested that structure of alp107- <dig> was partially stabilized by the interaction with the α-actinin rod region.

mapping of the interaction site with synthetic peptides and deletions
as nmr studies suggested that alp107- <dig> could exist in an elongated, unfolded conformation, even when interacting with α-actinin, we chose to map the interaction site using overlapping synthetic peptides . we focused our efforts on the minimum interaction area mapped by truncation mutagenesis, namely alp residues 151– <dig>  which included the zm motif  <cit> . the sequences of these peptides are shown in figure 7a. only peptide  <dig>  bound to the immobilized α-actinin rod domain  in the spr experiments. a clear interaction was seen with  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm peptide concentrations, whereas the other four peptides failed to interact even at  <dig> μm concentrations . to verify the interaction of peptide  <dig> with the rod, peptide  <dig> was immobilized and the rod was used as the soluble analyte . the rod interacted with the peptide with apparent kd of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m. however, in contrast to the alp107- <dig> fragment, peptide  <dig> did not interact with r2-r <dig> . a scrambled version of peptide  <dig>  did not interact with the rod domain, verifying the sequence specificity of the interaction with the rod . thus, an area of residues 175– <dig> containing the n-terminal half of the zm motif of alp appeared to interact directly with the α-actinin rod domain, but not with its two central spectrin repeats, r2-r <dig> 

the peptide binding studies suggested that sequences before and at the zm motif of alp are sufficient for interaction with α-actinin. to further test if this region was really necessary for the interaction, we constructed five overlapping deletions in alp107- <dig> between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  the deletions were 18– <dig> amino acids long and each was designed to include a stretch between two proline residues . four deletions that overlapped with peptide  <dig> totally abrogated the ability of alp107- <dig> to localize at stress fibres , whereas a deletion after the zm motif did not affect the localization. as the zm motif contains conserved tyrosine and serine residues that might be phosphorylated, we also made point mutations where these residues were changed to phenylalanine and alanine, respectively. this mutant also failed to localize to stress fibres . taken together, the peptide binding studies and the mutant studies suggested that the zm motif is sufficient and necessary for alp interaction with α-actinin in the stress fibres.

discussion
α-actinin interacting pdz-lim proteins are important for sarcomeric integrity as well as being involved in hypertrophic stretch activated signalling pathways in the muscle z disc  might be important for this interaction  <cit> . in the current paper, we have been able to map the interaction site in more detail. we showed that a synthetic peptide spanning alp residues 175– <dig> was able to interact directly with the α-actinin rod. two other peptides spanning parts of the zm motif did not interact and neither did two peptides before the zm motif. on the other hand, several deletion mutants before or at the zm motif abrogated the localization of yfp-alp fragments to α-actinin containing structures. notably, a deletion after the zm motif had no effect. a mutation at the conserved tyr-ser sequence in the zm motif  also abrogated localization of alp in cells. further studies are required to test whether this effect is dependent on phosphorylation, and whether phosphorylation could explain the lack of alp in focal adhesions where α-actinin is located.

thus, our peptide binding studies and deletion mutations suggest that the zm motif is directly involved in the interaction with the α-actinin rod. however, these results do not rule out the involvement of other areas of the alp internal region in the interaction. on the contrary, the involvement of other areas was suggested by the finding that while peptide  <dig> interacted strongly with the α-actinin rod fragment composed of four spectrin repeats , it did not interact with the two central spectrin repeats  of α-actinin. the alp107- <dig> fragment, on the other hand, interacted with both r1-r <dig> and r2-r <dig> fragments. these data are compatible with a hypothesis that the alp internal region may have an extended interaction surface on α-actinin and that the interaction surface may cover a large area of the α-actinin rod domain.

structural analysis showed that the alp internal region is largely unstructured and that interaction with α-actinin partially stabilizes its conformation, but does not induce any detectable secondary structure elements. we showed previously that two alp molecules can interact with the dimeric α-actinin rod domain  <cit> . combining this information with our current structural and hydrodynamic analyses suggests that the alp internal region is an elongated, flexible monomer in solution, although we cannot exclude the formation of dimer. notably, despite a lack of ordered structure, this fragment is rather stable and it can be expressed, purified and concentrated to a high degree. based on sequence analysis by programs such as foldindex  <cit>  or disembl  <cit> , the alp internal region cannot be classified as being intrinsically unfolded . analysis of the corresponding regions of other pdz-lim family members with the same programs yielded quite similar results .

CONCLUSIONS
our current data are compatible with the hypothesis that the alp internal region exists in an open, flexible conformation and forms a long interaction surface with the α-actinin rod region. we have also shown that sequences both before and at the conserved zm motif are required for interaction with α-actinin and that a short peptide from this area can interact directly.
