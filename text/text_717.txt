BACKGROUND
transcription is the major level at which cellular protein concentration is regulated in response to environmental and developmental cues. transcriptional control is mediated by the interaction of transcription factors and dna elements. these elements are normally one instance of a set of similar sequences  that the transcription factor ‘reads’ in a process known as direct read-out. there are some cases, however, where the transcription factor recognises not the sequence per se but the structure that the dna adopts as a consequence of both sequence and conditions. the disruption of the dna from the standard b-form conformation acts as a recognition site for the transcription factor in a process known as indirect read-out. this is well established in prokaryotes  but less recognised in eukaryotic cells, although an indirect read-out mechanism has been suggested for a selection of eukaryotic gene promoters . given the size of vertebrate genomes it is highly likely that some regions consist of sequences forming non-canonical structures and that some of these are regulatory. indeed local dna topography has been shown to correlate better than sequence with functional non-coding regions of the human genome  <cit> .

the canonical double-stranded dna structure is b-form, a right-handed helix with  <dig>  Å between base pairs and a base tilt of  <dig> degrees to the helix axis. however, dna can exist in a number of other conformations, the major types being a-form, z-form and tetraplex, all of which have been implicated in gene regulation . a-form is the canonical dsrna structure with right-handed helices but with only  <dig>  Å between bases and a 20-degree base tilt, while the sugar in a-form is in the c-3′ endo position in contrast to the c-2′ endo position observed for b-form. these differences lead to a-form helices being ‘shorter and fatter’, possessing major and minor grooves of similar width and the major groove deepened with respect to the b-form structure. although dna is usually in the canonical b-form it can be induced into a-form by dehydration and certain dna sequences can naturally adopt an a-form helix under physiological conditions  <cit> . these a-form elements can then be specifically recognised by dna binding proteins.

the interaction of the xenopus ccaat box transcription factor  complex and the promoter of the developmentally important gata <dig> gene is an example of a transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving a-form dna. we have previously shown that this mechanism is based on an interaction requiring both dna base specific  and dna structure specific  interactions  <cit> . the cbtf complex is composed of approximately eight sub-units of which the ilf <dig> protein is currently the only published component; however, this subunit is critical for cbtf activity. ilf <dig> is found in the nucleus when the gata <dig> gene, a developmentally regulated gene involved in blood formation, is transcribed. a number of biochemical experiments have also confirmed ilf <dig> as a regulator of gata <dig> transcription, including chromatin associated precipitation  identifying ilf <dig> at the gata <dig> promoter during active transcription of this gene  <cit> . therefore the cbtf complex and its interactions is of interest both from developmental and transcriptionally mechanistic viewpoints.

ilf <dig> contains two double stranded rna binding domains  and these domains are required for transcriptional activation in vivo and dna binding in vitro
 <cit> . the rna binding activity of ilf <dig>  and other dsrbd containing proteins, has been well characterised, indeed ilf <dig> was first identified through its interaction with rna  <cit> . crystal and nmr structures of a dsrbd alone exist  <cit> , as does a crystal structure of the protein-rna complex  <cit> . alongside saturation mutagenesis studies, these structural studies have revealed that the domains recognise the a-form helical structure of double stranded rna, although far less is known about their interaction with dna. we have previously shown that xenopus ilf <dig> contributes to the activity of cbtf as a transcriptional activator by its interaction with structure-specific dna sequences. specifically the dsrbds of ilf <dig> are capable of interacting not only with a-form rna but also non-canonical a-form dna, such as that at the gata <dig> promoter  <cit> .

here we report the development and validation of a bioinformatics tool for the analysis of genomic data to identify other potential promoters that utilise an a-form dna structural component; in particular, those that are responsive to the transcription factor ilf <dig> 

RESULTS
predicted promoter elements
we implemented our search program based on the a-form prediction algorithm of basham et. al
 <cit>  but including our previously described modifications  <cit> . this program was used to search the xenopus tropicalis jgi  <dig>  genome assembly for putative a-form promoters. searches were further restricted to a 500 bp 5′ proximity of a start site of a transcribed unit and also to a variety of motifs known to be common transcription factor binding sequences. the prediction of a-form dna is based on the a-dna propensity energy , a numerical measure derived from solvent free energy calculations that indicates the thermodynamic propensity for a sequence to adopt the a-dna conformation. the ape value at position i in a dna sequence depends on the central base bi and the 5′  and 3′  flanking bases. from a triplet code of ape values for tri-nucleotides, the ape value for each base-pair is calculated  as the sum of the triplet ape values for the forward and reverse strands. in our process we have defined the predicted a-form promoter sequence  as a sequence with consecutive negative ape values, together with the two flanking bases required for the ape calculation. given a direct read-out promoter motif, for each gene the algorithm searches a region upstream of the transcription start site  for instances of the motif or its reverse complement preceded by an aps of pre-specified minimum length, with the aps and motif separated by at most a pre-specified maximum distance. the combined promoter sequence  extends from the start of the aps to the end of the motif .figure  <dig> 
a combined promoter sequence consists of an a-form promoter element followed by a direct read-out promoter motif. the ape row indicates the signs of the ape values for the sequence in the base row; with x denoting undetermined ape values  <cit> . the main parameters are the number of negative ape values in the aps , and the gap between the aps and the motif.



we selected aps sequences of length ≥ 12 bp preceding several common promoter sequence motifs by at most  <dig> positions and within 500 bp of a tss. a minimum aps of 12 bp was selected as our preliminary experimental studies show that this length of aps reliably gives an a-form structure as identified by circular dichroism , while a limit of 20 bp between the aps and motif is based on the known footprint of the cbtf complex  <cit> . the number of aps and cps  in the  <dig>  assembly of the xenopus tropicalis genome are shown in table  <dig> along with their frequencies in regions 500 bp upstream of a tss. the frequencies of the four motifs, in the whole genome and constrained to cps or regions 500 bp upstream of a tss, are shown in table  <dig>  the full list of hits is provided in table  <dig>  in general the ccaat, agata and tgata motifs occur with high frequency and in many cases several instances of a motif are found preceding a gene. the a-dna promoter sequences, however, occur before only  <dig> % of genes. an aps therefore occur only rarely in comparison with the motifs, and the combined promoter sequences only appear before approximately  <dig> % of genes. monte carlo simulation of  <dig> sequences of 500 bp selected randomly according to the nucleotide frequencies in the xenopus tropicalis genome ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig> ) produced expected numbers of  <dig>  aps and  <dig>  cps in the genome. thus we estimate that there are almost  <dig> times more aps and over  <dig> times more cps in regions 500 bp upstream of tss in the xenopus tropicalis genome than would be expected by chance.table  <dig>

selection and validation of a predicted promoter
having identified  <dig> putative promoter elements in the jgi  <dig>  assembly we randomly selected five for validation. the 36 bp sequences corresponding to the five selected cpss are shown in figure  <dig> with their predicted transcription factor binding sites. experimentally we confirmed that these sequences were  a-form in character and  indeed a target for a dna binding protein.figure  <dig>

circular dichroism experimental studies of all five selected sequences confirm that these gc-rich duplexes are largely in the a-form conformation. the data shows two strong positive bands with maxima between 186-189 nm and 267-269 nm respectively for all five constructs with a negative band minima between 240-243 nm, these spectra are indicative of a-form. the absence of a clear, strong positive band at 180-186 nm suggest there is little b-form dna duplex present in any of the five sequences, although there is weak positive contribution between 180-190 nm for thrsp, obp, kif <dig> and gdi <dig> causing a slight distortion to the main positive band . further, the intensity of the band maxima at  is significantly more positive than expected for b-form  and the experimental ellipticity values are more typical of a-form duplexes . using the triple base ape prediction for a and b-form dna duplexes all five selected dna sequences have strong continuous a-form runs upstream of the ccaat, agata and gggcgg motifs. these continuous a-form regions only represent  <dig> to 39% of the total duplexes in the a-form for all five sequences, the cd measurements suggest that the a-form content is at least between  <dig> to 80% for all five duplexes. using the triple base ape prediction for a and b-form dna duplexes the total a-form prediction content for gtf2e <dig>  for example is 56% with 20% having no bias for a or b-form, 14% undetermined ape values, 11% with a preference for b-form duplexes. this would suggest the minimum a-form content is 56% and may be as high as 85%, however in all cases the duplexes are mainly in the a-form conformation.

we next tested that these oligonucleotides were specific targets for dna binding proteins such as transcription factors. radiolabelled sequences were mixed with whole embryo extract and electrophoretic mobility shift  assays were performed. all the sequences found specific complexes with embryo extract, these complexes were competed by unlabelled self-competitor. however they were not competed by an alternative 36 bp competitor that contained a ccaat box sequence but which was strongly b-form in structure . having shown that all five of the selected sequences were both a-form and targets for specific dna binding proteins we selected the gdi <dig> putative promoter, which contains a direct  ccaat motif, for further characterisation and to test if it was also a target of the ilf <dig> containing transcription factor complex cbtf.figure  <dig>

in vitro
.  duplex 36 bp oligonucleotides corresponding to the five identified putative promoter elements display a-form dna characteristics as observed by circular dichroism.  these duplex oligonucletides are shifted in emsa experiments, these complexes are competed by titration of unlabelled self-competitor but not by ccaat box containing b-form duplexes. the specific complexes are indicated by arrows.  the sequence of the b-form competitor used in the emsa is shown, the ccaat box is indicated in bold.



upon co-incubation of an antibody raised against ilf <dig> the gdi <dig> complex was supershifted in emsa, confirming the presence of ilf <dig> in the nucleic acid-protein complex . the role of the gdi <dig> putative promoter element was also tested in vivo. to this end the expression profile of gdi <dig> was analysed using rt-pcr. expression of gdi <dig> mrna is absent until stage  <dig>  then is expressed between stage  <dig> and  <dig>  the latter of which it is at maximal, and from which its expression levels decrease until the last point sampled at stage  <dig> . this expression wave occurs just after the maximal expression of gata <dig>  a gene that is also controlled by the ilf <dig> transcription factor. a dominant-negative form of ilf <dig>  uses the fusion of ilf <dig> to the engrailed domain from drosophila to repress transcription from any ilf <dig> binding site by recruitment of histone deacetylases  <cit> . this fusion has been shown to down-regulate gata <dig> mrna levels when exogenouly expressed in xenopus tropocalis embryos  <cit> . synthetic mrna encoding ilf3en was micro-injected into one-cell stage embryos before harvesting at stage  <dig> and total rna was extracted, rt-pcr was again used to analyse levels of gdi <dig> mrna. expression of gdi <dig> was ablated relative to levels of engrailed alone injected controls , indicating ilf <dig> is involved in regulation of gdi <dig> in vivo at a transcriptional level.figure  <dig> 
the expression of
gdi3
mrna is maximal at neurula stage and can be modulated by ilf <dig>   the complex gdi <dig> specific complex can be supershifted by addition of anti-ilf <dig> antibody.  the gdi <dig> gene expression is zygotic and peaks at neurula stage  <dig> when ilf <dig> is known to be nuclear and active.  expression of gdi <dig> is ablated relative to an internal control, odc, by exogenous expression a dominant-negative form of ilf <dig>  which acts at the transcriptional level.



CONCLUSIONS
we have previously identified and characterised a promoter element that requires an unusual a-form dna structure in conjunction with a known promoter sequence motif. this combination of direct and indirect read-out mechanism drives early embryonic expression of the gata <dig> gene in xenopus and is responsive to the ilf <dig> containing transcription factor complex cbtf. however, the question of the prevalence of this type of regulatory mechanism in genomes remained. to address this we implemented a perl program to investigate the occurence and used this to search the  <dig>  version of the xenopus genome. from the  <dig> hits obtained we selected five to test for both actual a-form structure and as specific targets for dna binding proteins. all five of the selected targets were experimentally validated as a-form and as protein binding sites. one of these five, containing a ccaat motif as does the previously identified gata <dig> promoter, was selected for further validation. this element is the putative promoter for the gdi <dig> gene and was shown by supershift to be a target for the known gata <dig> transcription factor ilf <dig>  the temporal expression pattern of gdi <dig> occurs shortly after that of gata <dig> and gdi <dig> transcription is also responsive to ilf <dig> fusion proteins in vivo. taken together this is strong evidence for the element identified by the program to be a critical component of the promoter of gdi <dig> 

identification of the promoter elements required the a-forming potential of a base triplet of a given sequence to be calculated in a moving window along the genome using the method of basham et. al. in the overwhelming majority of hits the aps consists of a consecutive sequence of cs or gs, with the first or second position in a block of cs occasionally replaced by a t. only five cases were observed where this pattern does not hold, all involving repeated blocks of atgc. however, it should be noted that ape values do not exist for  <dig> of the  <dig> possible triplets, which are effectively ignored by the present algorithm. the reliability of the method would no doubt be increased if these non-determined values were assigned. despite this, apte provides a powerful tool for potential identification of a-form regulatory elements in whole genomes. a major problem in eukaryotic transcriptional studies is that transcription factor binding sites occur with high frequency and this leads to many ‘false positive’ identification of promoter elements by search programs. potentially by considering dna structure the reliability of such search programs could be significantly enhanced. for instance there are  <dig>  ccaat sequences  within 500 bp of a tss in the  <dig>  genome and  <dig>  aps sequences anywhere in the genome. however there are only  <dig> in conjunction, a far more manageable number to screen.

previous work on indirect read out mechanisms invoved with dna recognition has largely been limited to in vitro experiments. our validation of gdi <dig> as being regulated by such a mechanism is at least partially in vivo. within eukaryotic genomes dna is chromatinised with the interactions of the histones and the dna, providing not only packaging but regulatory functions. it is unclear how non b-form dna structures affects chromatinisation, possibly they chromatinise less well and are therefore bare regions at promoters, but the fact that we have identified a gene that is regulated in vivo by an a-form binding protein suggests that these structures persist within the chromatin environmment.

although our results reflect mainly the identification of genes responsive to the ilf <dig> transcription factor potentially other a-form dna binding proteins may also be recognising these elements. importantly, the ability to look at whole genome assemblies means that it is now possible to study the role of these a-form elements within gene regulatory networks.
