BACKGROUND
saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are widely used for production of alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer, sake, as well as bioethanol. the selection of yeast strains for efficient fermentation performance in these industrial processes has typically focused on attributes such as predictable fermentation at the relevant process temperatures, desired fermentation vigour and extent of sugar attenuation with efficient conversion to ethanol. attributes deemed important for wine fermentation include retention and enhancement of varietal  fruit characters and production of desirable flavour and aroma compounds  <cit> . the numerous subtle differences in fermentation traits between the various industrial yeast strains are reflected in the overall genetic diversity found in this species  <cit> . nevertheless, industrial yeast share the ability to grow and ferment in high sugar media, sensing, responding and adapting to the extreme and changing conditions. such conditions are imposed by anaerobic conditions, high concentrations of sugar and organic acids , toxins and inhibitors, at times low ph and assimilable nitrogen levels, extended fermentation times and increasing concentration of ethanol or other inhibitors. our understanding of the cellular mechanisms behind yeast’s adaptation to the temporal exposure to multiple environmental stresses in such fermentations is limited despite extensive studies in the past decade.

extensive ‘phenomic’ studies have been undertaken with laboratory yeast collections, comprised of individual known single gene deletion mutants , whereby the phenotype of such deletants is analysed to determine the genes associated with tolerance to a specific condition. several studies have looked at tolerance or growth sensitivity to singular conditions related to high sugar fermentation, including high osmolarity , anaerobic growth  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , tolerance to high pressure and low temperatures  <cit> , ethanol  and acetic acid  <cit> . these studies typically did not require the completion of fermentation and were conducted under aerobic conditions usually for 1– <dig> days only.

this study is unique in that it sought to identify genes required by yeast to not only grow in but to complete fermentation of a high sugar medium, that is a chemically defined grape juice, wherein multiple stresses would be experienced simultaneously or sequentially. the non-availability of a deletion library in a prototrophic wine yeast background necessitated the use of the laboratory yeast library, derived from s288c  <cit> . although these lab yeast strains are reported to cope poorly with high osmotic pressure as found in grape juice  <cit> , we and others have shown that the s288c derived diploid by <dig> and haploids by <dig>  and by <dig>  <cit> , are able to complete fermentation in high sugar media  <cit> , provided their auxotrophic requirements are met.

previous studies have identified genes essential for growth under particular conditions relevant to fermentation, but not the entire fermentation process itself. sufficient biomass is critical for fermentation performance; if there is too little, fermentation becomes severely protracted or may even fail to complete. adequate biomass does not however guarantee fermentation completion, especially in high sugar media. furthermore, whilst transcriptomic experiments highlighted genes whose expression was significantly altered during fermentation, these genes are not necessarily required for fermentation reliability.

this report relates to the effect of gene deletions on yeast’s ability to complete extended high sugar fermentation. those deletants whose maximum biomass was at least 70% of the parent but which exhibited protracted  fermentation were taken to highlight genes fundamental for successful fermentation in high sugar conditions, such as in wine production. the clustering of these into specific groupings i.e. gene ontology  terms provides insight into the many cellular mechanisms behind yeast’s adaptation to fermentation stresses.

RESULTS
a micro-fermentation screen to identify genes required for successful fermentation in a high sugar medium
in this study , a high throughput fermentation screen was developed to identify those genes required for high sugar  fermentation, whereby deletion of the corresponding genes would result in protracted or arrested fermentation. whereas previous screens have focused on growth assays using standard laboratory media such as ypd supplemented with a stress agent , our approach was to test the ability of yeast to complete extended fermentation, albeit on a micro-scale. the ability to undergo a wine fermentation requires the yeast to respond and adapt to a dynamic and temporal exposure to multiple stresses in the ‘juice’ environment. specifically, upon inoculation the cell population must be able to grow to a high density whilst exposed to high osmotic conditions  and the rapid depletion of oxygen and nitrogenous nutrients, sterols and vitamins  <cit> . with the bulk of fermentation being conducted by cells in stationary phase, long-term adaptation is paramount to the cell’s tolerance to increasing levels of ethanol, as a consequence of sugar uptake and catabolism.figure  <dig>

chemically defined grape juice medium  containing  <dig> g l− <dig> sugar  was chosen for the high sugar medium. whilst fructose and glucose are found in grape must  <cit>  and  <dig> g l− <dig> of sugars is considerably higher than the  <dig> g l− <dig> used in laboratory media, this concentration is at the lower end of typical concentrations found in grape must . this compromise was made due to the poorer fermentative ability of laboratory strains in comparison to wine yeast strains  <cit> , in particular the reported sensitivity of s288c derivatives under high osmotic pressure  <cit> . the assimilable nitrogen content  was sufficient for complete fermentation of  <dig> g l− <dig> of sugar and greater than the minimum requirement by yeast  and also addressed the auxotrophic requirements of the diploid strain, by <dig>  in which the yeast homozygous gene deletion collection was generated  <cit> . at the study’s commencement the lack of availability of a prototrophic yeast deletion collection in either a laboratory yeast  <cit>  or wine yeast genetic background  <cit>  meant that fermentation without the addition of amino acids matched to the auxotrophic requirements of by <dig> could not be investigated. such an investigation is nonetheless of interest to determine the genetic basis for differences in the nitrogen efficiency of yeast  <cit> .

the initial screen was performed in duplicate  <dig>  ml fermentations at 28°c over 7 days in uracil-supplemented cdgjm_ <dig>  this medium supported growth of the parental strain by <dig>  with all glucose and fructose being consumed within 144 h . the individual fermentation performance of each of the ~ <dig> yeast clones of the homozygous diploid deletion collection was compared with by <dig> . the extent of fermentation was defined by enzymatic determination of the residual glucose and fructose content after 180 h and was considered complete when the total residual sugar was < <dig>  g l− <dig>  the additional 36 h, representing an extra 25% in fermentation duration, was chosen to allow for growth discrepancies due to the potential for minor differences in inoculation rates.  <dig> gene deletion mutants were identified as having failed to complete fermentation after 180 h .

in order to eliminate the possibility that incomplete fermentation by these  <dig> deletants was due to impaired growth, micro-fermentations were repeated with the additional estimation of growth  over the duration of the fermentation . residual sugars in the subsequent experiment were analysed at 137 h , and only deletants with optical densities  comparable to by <dig>  were chosen for further investigation. in such candidates, the corresponding gene deletion was considered to have no or little effect on growth and to more specifically affect fermentation. as such,  <dig> deletants were chosen as potential candidates dysfunctional in fermentation under high sugar conditions.

evaluation of deletants in laboratory scale  fermentation
to test that the fermentation phenotype of the  <dig> deletants was reproducible in a more controlled environment, the performance of these was compared with the parent strain in larger, 100 ml fermentations . fermentations conducted at this scale allow greater control over parameters which influence experimental reproducibility and fermentation outcome, such as inoculum preparation, maintenance of anaerobiosis and the inclusion of biological triplicates. the relative fermentation duration  of deletant versus parent was recorded in the experimental data . seventy two deletants had protracted fermentation, taking 20% or longer to complete fermentation than the parent. eight of these were not only protracted but did not complete fermentation  and the fermentations were deemed ‘stuck’.figure  <dig> 
comparative fermentations with parent yeast by <dig> and nine stuck mutants in cdgjm_ <dig>  fermentations  were performed in triplicate in cdgjm_ <dig> at 28°c whereby the deletants were compared directly with the parental strain by <dig>  growth was monitored as optical density at 600 nm . sugar consumption was monitored enzymatically and reported as total or individual sugars . the data are arranged in three rows  of three plots each . the first plot in each row depicts total residual sugar. glucose-only and fructose-only information is shown to the right of the corresponding total sugar plot. the nine deletion strains  which result in arrested or ‘stuck’ fermentation are shown in rows a , b  and c .



the remaining  <dig> mutants exhibited fermentation durations similar to the parent . these findings indicate that although there was a 29% over-estimation of genes affecting fermentation in the second screen , 71% of the clones were still identified as affecting fermentation.

the  <dig> deletants identified as being protracted in fermentation in a high sugar medium  were screened as part of the original  <dig>  in a micro-fermentation of low sugar medium  containing 20 g l− <dig> . the  <dig> deletants could be separated into two distinct groups based on two time points at which residual sugar was measured during fermentation: 32 h  and 56 h . at 32 h, the cut-off of  <dig>  g l− <dig> residual sugar was used;  <dig> deletants were found to have completed fermentation, with  <dig> deletants having > <dig>  g l− <dig> sugar. at 56 hours all the deletants except Δtkl <dig> had completed fermentation. tkl <dig> was retained in the  <dig> gene dataset based on the delay in fermentation when examined in 100 ml scale using cdgjm_ <dig> 

use of the fryg databases to identify genes which modulate fermentation - the ‘fermentome’
two fryg databases  were separately compiled from previously published fermentation relevant studies and the saccharomyces genome database . the databases were complementary; the first  was derived from relevant literature, examining single stress conditions related to fermentation. the second , was compiled from fermentation relevant phenotype terms specifically selected from the more general sgd phenotype terms database, whereby only null mutants  with a specific phenotypic response, i.e. decreased resistance or increased sensitivity were selected. the  <dig> gene dataset  was compared to the two fryg databases in order to determine which were previously reported . the sgd_fryg database was more inclusive with  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes being previously reported in related conditions whilst only  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were identified in the lit_fryg database.

go analysis of the identified  <dig> fermentation essential genes highlighted specific biological processes and more importantly, the other gene members for each go term, that are likely to be important for fermentation. to ensure that these related genes were not incorrectly excluded as ‘false negatives’ they were re-examined here in a follow up screen. of the  <dig> mutants examined,  <dig> gave protracted fermentation in cdgjm_ <dig> 

one of these,  did not finish fermentation and was considered ‘stuck’ . the  <dig> genes were cross-referenced to both fryg datasets . the genes absent from the databases are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

the  <dig> feg dataset identified after the fermentation screen and go analysis depicted in figure  <dig>  was compared with the lit_fryg and sgd_fryg databases .



in summary,  <dig> genes were identified as being required for fermentation, whereby deletion of the gene resulted in the yeast undergoing protracted fermentation in cdgjm_ <dig> . together, the  <dig> genes, are referred to as the feg dataset  and comprise the laboratory yeast ‘fermentome’; genes that are essential for the timely completion of fermentation. the ‘fermentome’ is taken to represent the genes/processes required for yeast to sense and respond to the multiple stresses of the juice environment. these cellular processes enable yeast to grow in grape juice and complete fermentation over the extended period of 4– <dig> days typical of a wine fermentation. the experimental design however did not allow for the identification of genes whose deletion shortened fermentation, as no time point was taken prior to the parent finishing. independent studies have identified genes which affect carbon and nitrogen flux and thus positively modulate fermentation, although the mechanisms remain unclear. for example the genes ngr <dig> and gid <dig>  upon disruption, resulted in enhanced catabolism of sugar in a wine and laboratory strain during growth in cdgjm_ <dig> with limiting nitrogen  <cit> . also, deletion of pda <dig>  encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase eα subunit, was shown to alter carbon flux during anaerobic fermentation, resulting in shortened fermentation, after an extended lag phase , which the authors suggested was an acclimatisation to the fermentation conditions  <cit> .

the studies chosen to build the lit_fryg dataset included those examining growth in response to a single stress relevant to wine fermentation  as well as a transcriptomic study of the wine strain vin  <dig> during fermentation of a riesling juice  <cit> . our dataset represents only a small percentage of the genes identified in the above studies, as shown in lit_fryg , relating to growth sensitivity as a measure of stress tolerance. not surprisingly, the largest representations relate to hypertonic conditions   <cit> , high glucose   <cit> , ethanol , anaerobic growth  and sucrose   <cit>  – see additional file  <dig>  the importance of experimental design is highlighted by the fact that our study contained only  <dig> % of genes described as fermentation stress response  genes  <cit> . although marks and co-workers  <cit>  looked at gene expression in response to increasing ethanol concentration during fermentation, small changes in transcript levels of fsr may not eventuate in altered fermentation kinetics or outcome - a more likely observation with complete deletion as per our study. a similar conclusion was drawn from data relating to growth rate and stress tolerance  <cit> , whereby the authors examined the yeast deletion collection in continuous culture.

eighteen of the  <dig> genes, which resulted in protracted fermentation when deleted, were annotated to vacuole function, specifically the vacuolar h+ atpase complex. within this dataset,  <dig> genes were identified by relationship rather than in the original fermentation screen  due to clonal errors within the library used in the study. new clones were sourced  and verified by sequencing prior to analysis . the occurrence of  <dig> of these genes in the freeze thaw stress dataset   <cit>  indicates that cellular mechanisms required for tolerance to freeze-thaw stress  <cit>  may also be needed for successful fermentation. by comparison of our results to previous studies , we propose that the role of the vacuole, specifically maintenance of vacuolar acidification  is a key mechanism of cellular response and adaptation during the transitory and dynamic stress conditions imposed by acidic ph, high osmolarity , increasing ethanol content and elevated temperatures during fermentation.

the association between cross-tolerance to multiple stresses and fermentation outcome, as well as fermentative growth and stress tolerance was examined. genes common to the feg dataset and selected datasets from the sgd_fryg database can be highlighted . here only  <dig> fermentation essential genes are compared as the additional  <dig>  unique to our study are necessarily excluded. of particular interest was the large number of genes, when deleted, were associated with decreased resistance to multiple stresses: ethanol, acidic and hyper-osmotic conditions and heat , plc <dig> , tps <dig> , and ssq <dig>  as shown in additional file 3).figure  <dig> 
comparison of fermentation essential genes with the sgd_fryg database: phenotypic response to specific stress conditions. ninety three fermentation essential genes  were identified in this study. ten of the genes have not been previously associated with fermentation related phenotypes and are unique to this fermentation study. the venn diagrams therefore depict the number of genes within the  <dig> feg dataset which upon deletion, leads to either increased sensitivity or decreased resistance to conditions relevant to fermentation, such as anaerobic growth, ethanol toxicity, osmotic and oxidative stress and temperature extremes.



yeast deletants encoding the vacuolar h+ atpase  were often associated with cross tolerance towards several stress conditions but not necessarily fermentative growth. surprisingly, none of the  <dig> gene deletions were associated with decreased utilisation of nitrogen and fermentative metabolism .

classification of genes into specific gene ontology categories
using go toolbox  <cit>  and go module  <cit>  the fermentation essential genes  were classified into distinct groups according to go terms, based on their role in a biological process, function within the cell and cellular localisation . the frequency of occurrence within the genome of genes annotated to these go terms was compared to the frequency of occurrence of genes within the feg dataset annotated to these same terms. an increased frequency of occurrence  of genes in the feg dataset annotated to a specific go term implies the importance of that go cluster to fermentation completion.

a subset of the most enriched go terms  includes gene clusters related to vacuolar function and cellular ph and ion homeostasis . the vacuole has a multifunctional role; trafficking of membrane proteins to the plasma membrane, proteolytic degradation and recycling of proteins sent to the vacuole  <cit> , sequestration of toxic metal ions, ion homeostasis , osmo-regulation  and storage of amino acids  <cit> . disruption of these functions can therefore have far reaching consequences for a cell grown at high osmolarity and low ph conditions.figure  <dig> 
enrichment of feg annotated to specific go terms from sgd using go toolbox go-stats. the frequency of gene occurrence  for individual go terms was compared between the  <dig> feg dataset and the entire yeast genome . these go terms were not mutually exclusive. the statistical probability was calculated to determine the enrichment of the specific go terms, expressed as p-values. numbers in brackets represent the number of genes in feg annotated to a specific go term. data from the yeast genome is denoted with □ and the feg dataset  with ■.



incomplete ‘stuck’ fermentation as a result of deletion of specific genes
nine deletants within the  <dig> gene feg dataset gave rise to incomplete  fermentations . these genes are central to ion homeostasis ), ssq <dig> ), nad recycling ), signalling ), trehalose synthesis , tps <dig> ), transcription , zap <dig> ), and ubiquitin recycling ). with the exception of Δtps <dig> and Δptk <dig>  which showed normal growth, the other  <dig> ‘stuck’ mutants exhibited reduced biomass . our findings are only in part comparable to the sgd database where Δtps <dig>  Δtps <dig>  Δnpt <dig>  Δplc <dig>  and Δssq <dig> were shown to have reduced fermentative growth . underlying these differences is likely the experimental approach used. it is evident that final biomass  does not necessarily determine whether yeast are able to catabolise sugar albeit in an extended time frame  or fail to catabolise all of the sugar . four vma mutants  that had a similar growth deficiency  were able to catabolise sugar albeit more slowly than the parent by <dig> .table  <dig>

comparative fermentations with parent yeast by <dig> and four Δvma mutants and Δopi <dig> in cdgjm_ <dig>  fermentations  were performed in triplicate in cdgjm_ <dig> at 28°c whereby the deletants were compared directly with the parental strain by <dig>  fermentation progress was monitored by determining the total residual sugar  by enzymatic analysis. growth was monitored as optical density  20 h post-inoculation and at intervals throughout fermentation.



all  <dig> genes associated with stuck fermentations were shown to have increased sensitivity towards multiple stresses relevant to fermentation , with doa <dig>  ssq <dig> and tps <dig> being associated with five stresses. interestingly, only sin <dig>  ssq <dig>  tps <dig> and tps <dig> genes were associated with ‘response to stress’ go: <dig>  although there was no over-representation within the feg dataset for genes annotated to this go term. whilst Δplc <dig> results in decreased glucose utilisation, none of the  <dig> stuck mutants are listed as decreased fermentation metabolism, decreased nitrogen utilisation or decreased anaerobic growth .

role of tps <dig> and tps <dig> as protectants against multiple stresses
tps <dig>  and tps <dig>  are required for trehalose biosynthesis and not surprisingly were both identified in this study as fegs. deletion of either tps <dig> or tps <dig> leads to complete cessation of sugar utilisation in the second half of fermentation i.e. a ‘stuck’ fermentation . trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide, ordinarily accumulates during stationary phase and is classified as a storage carbohydrate  <cit> . it is associated with increased survival and cell protection from stresses such as heat, ethanol and freezing  <cit> . accordingly, trehalose protects against lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation resulting from ethanol induced oxidative stress, which would otherwise impact on membrane dynamics and glycolysis, respectively  <cit> . past studies have shown sensitivity of Δtps <dig> to ethanol  <cit>  and oxidative stress  <cit> , and Δtps <dig> to ethanol, heat, and nacl  <cit> , high acidity  <cit>  and oxidative stress  <cit> . conversely, over-expression of these genes results in enhanced thermotolerance and improved ethanol resistance . given the recent link between mitochondrial mutation and ageing  <cit> , and trehalose  <cit> , and that fermentation is conducted by metabolically active but stationary phase cells, it is likely that the lack of trehalose in Δtps <dig> and Δtps <dig>  <cit>  results in a vastly decreased ability of the cell to protect against the toxic effect of ethanol, leading to increased mitochondrial dysfunction and premature ageing and reduced viability during fermentation.

role of sin <dig> in thermal stress
adaptation to elevated temperatures, especially above 30°c and in the presence of ethanol  <cit> , is fundamental to survival and the ability to complete fermentation. the primary mechanism is the heat shock response operating through chromatin modulation by the rpd3l deacetylase complex, which is recruited to target promoters upon heat stress affecting transcription and general metabolic processes . sin <dig> is associated with the heat shock response; deletion of which resulted in the complete arrest of fermentation . sin3p is a component of the rpd3l complex, along with sap30p and rxt3p. the latter two genes, when deleted, resulted in only protracted fermentation. the rdp3l complex is proposed to facilitate the ability of yeast to tolerate multiple stresses including thermal and osmotolerance but not oxidative stress  <cit> .

ssq <dig> and zap <dig> in ion homeostasis
osmotic stress, whether salt or sugar induced, is well known to have a direct effect on cellular ion homeostasis  <cit> . in response to the external environment, various transporters transport cations into the organelles and across the plasma membrane, such that cell turgidity is maintained  <cit> . in this study  <dig> genes  involved in ion homeostasis were identified as having a role in fermentation.

two fegs in particular, ssq <dig> and zap <dig>  involved in iron and zinc homeostasis respectively, resulted in ‘stuck’ fermentation . ssq <dig> encodes a mitochondrial hsp70-type molecular chaperone that is required for the assembly of fe-s clusters into fe-s proteins, such as the mitochondrial proteins aconitase, yfh1p and several dna repair enzymes  <cit> . iron homeostasis is proposed to be highly regulated, with the fe-s clusters thought to function as regulatory sensors to oxidative stress and intracellular iron . yeast strains lacking the fe-s cluster scaffold protein isu1p or chaperone protein ssq1p increase iron sequestration to the mitochondria, and show increased mitochondrial oxidative damage  <cit> . transcription of isu <dig> was altered during fermentation in response to increasing external ethanol content  <cit> , however, in this study Δisu <dig> had comparable fermentation duration to the parent . given the speculation on fe-s proteins acting as iron sensors, decreased formation of these proteins as observed in Δssq <dig>  <cit>  may lead to a signalling of iron deficiency within the mitochondria. this may cause an increase in mitochondrial uptake and decrease in export of iron, and consequently mitochondrial iron overload and subsequent oxidative damage. Δssq <dig> has been previously shown to be sensitive to oxidation  <cit> , which may explain the fermentation phenotype of Δssq <dig> in our study, in terms of oxidative stress associated with fermentation in cdgjm_ <dig> and the low iron content   <cit> , which is in the lower range  of typical australian chardonnay juices  <cit> . given that mitochondrial dysfunction has recently been linked with vacuolar acidification in affecting chronological ageing  <cit>  it is of interest that the Δssq <dig> deletant is not defective in vacuolar acidification .

it appears that zinc homeostasis is also critical to fermentation, through the transcriptional control of some  <dig> genes exerted by the zinc-sensing transcription factor zap1p, . these include genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, zinc uptake and vacuolar storage , sulfur metabolism, cell wall function and response to oxidation   <cit> . zap1p has a protective role with regards to oxidative stress and damage. the down-regulation of sulfur metabolism by zap1p in zinc deficient cells is associated with increased protection through the redirection of nadph from sulfur metabolism to regenerating reduced peroxiredoxin and glutathione associated with antioxidant defence mechanisms . the extended and incomplete fermentation profiles of Δzap <dig>  indicate that zap1p’s role as a core regulatory protein particularly in oxidative protection and perhaps vacuolar storage is vital for fermentation maintenance.

influence of intracellular ph on fermentation
go analysis of the feg dataset , not only highlighted the enrichment of  <dig> genes associated with the vacuolar h+ atpase complex   but also dbf <dig>   <cit>  and nhx <dig>   <cit> , known to be involved with regulation of intracellular ph. the tight regulation of intracellular ph, whilst influenced by external ph and nutrient availability, is reflective of most physiological processes being ph dependent  <cit> . critical to this, is the cytosol’s buffering capacity, originating from the acid–base action of metabolites such as ammonium, phosphate and carbon dioxide, as well as proteins  <cit> . as such, ph ‘sensing’ is associated with many processes including carbon flux through the glycolytic cycle, coupled reduction-oxidation reactions involved in nad+ cycling as well as phosphatidylinositol phosphates acting as signalling molecules to effect transcription  <cit> .

the main ph regulator in yeast is a p <dig> type h+atpase; pma1p, responsible for the active translocation of protons across the plasma membrane into the external medium, thus maintaining cytosolic ph at neutral  <cit> . the second, is the vacuolar  h+atpase, a complex of two domains, v <dig>  and v <dig> , which is responsible for the active transport of protons from the cytosol into the vacuolar lumen  <cit> . pma <dig>  is an essential gene and so not present in the homozygous diploid deletion library used in this study. however, the heterozygous diploid  results in haploinsufficiency, i.e. reduced growth rate in grape juice conditions ) and surprisingly also the reverse, haploproficiency  in nitrogen and carbon limiting conditions   <cit> .

pma1p activation is dependent on a complex interaction between glucose sensors such as snf3p and rgt2p, and the gpr1p/gpa2p receptor/g protein-coupled  complex  <cit> , protein kinase c   <cit> , phospholipase c   <cit> , the proteosome, and interaction with tubulin . several studies conducted on glucose starved cells, using specific inhibitors of plc <dig>   <cit>  and pma1p   <cit>  in conjunction with glucose additions  have demonstrated the activation of pma1p to be mediated by plc1p and the gpcr complex. plc1p is proposed to transduce the glucose signal, through calcium signalling, by the induction of calcium uptake into the cell and vacuolar transport into the cytoplasm  gpr1p aids rapid adaption to extracellular glucose , via the camp-pka pathway  <cit> . the latter activates camp signalling via a glucose phosphorylation mechanism  <cit> .

in this study genes associated with hexose sensing were identified; gpa <dig>  and gpr <dig> ), together with asc <dig>  and hxk <dig> , whose deletion was shown to induce protracted fermentation . hxk1p, which is associated with heat shock response, is one of three protein kinases  required for glucose phosphorylation, as a means of intracellular signalling via gpr1p-gpa2p. whilst asc1p, a guanine dissociation inhibitor of gpa2p, links glucose metabolism to nitrogen metabolism, as it represses gcn4p when amino acids are sufficient  <cit> .

plc <dig>  was also identified in the feg dataset . the inability of the Δplc deletant to complete sugar catabolism, as shown in figure  <dig> alludes to the importance of plc1p in cellular metabolism; although the physiological roles during fermentation are not well understood. plc1p has been implicated in nutrient induced signal transduction via the gpr1p-gpa2p mediated gpcr system, coupling glucose and nitrogen signalling at the sensor level  <cit> , as well as controlling the map kinase cascade via activation of pkc1p. this cascade is essential to adaptation to high osmolarity and cell wall integrity  <cit> ; obvious important attributes for successful fermentation.

hrk <dig>  and ptk <dig>  were also identified and encode protein kinases responsible for the activation of pma1p in response to glucose  <cit> . the membrane potential generated by pma1p is modulated by the uptake of potassium  by the trk1p and trk2p transporters; allowing for different voltage sensitive transporters to function in cation transport  <cit> . the central role of ph  homeostasis in fermentation is further supported by the inclusion of trk <dig>  in the feg dataset, which encodes the high affinity k+ transporter and is also found to be important for resistance to high-glucose  <cit>  and high acidity  <cit> .

interestingly, pma1p activity is reduced in yeast in high sugar fermentation conditions with recovery to normal activity being incomplete upon transfer to low sugar conditions  <cit> . teixeira and co-workers  <cit>  propose that vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane is affected, given the mis-targeting of pma1p in vma mutants lacking v-atpase subunits to the vacuole  <cit> . ph and ion homeostatic mechanisms via v-atpase are implicated in both osmotic shock from salt and sugar  <cit> , with v-atpase contributing to not only vesicle protein trafficking but intracellular  ph through the translocation of protons into the vacuolar lumen. nhx <dig>  encoding the endosomal k+ /h+ exchanger, nhx1p, was also identified as a feg in our study. nhx1p is implicated in regulating vacuolar and cytosolic ph  <cit> , and is thought to represent an early response to hyperosmotic conditions by the transport of ions into the vacuole  <cit> .

the complex interaction between pma1p, v-atpase and other symporters is in part also mediated by the lipid rafts associated with these membrane bound proteins. in a recent study  <cit>  lipid raft integrity of the plasma membrane was implicated in ph homeostasis and growth. edelsofine, an anti-tumor lysophosphatidyl choline analog, was shown to alter the organisation of the plasma membrane, resulting in ubiquitination and internalisation of pma1p to the vacuole, resulting in cytoplasmic acidification  <cit> . the link between membrane  integrity, intracellular ph, and fermentation phenotype is also inferred from the sensitivity of the following feg mutants to edelsofine, Δasc <dig>  Δdfb <dig>  Δsnf <dig>  Δsin <dig>  Δtrk <dig>  Δvma <dig>  Δvma <dig>  Δvma <dig>  Δvma <dig>  Δvma <dig>  Δvma <dig>  Δvma <dig>  Δvma <dig> and Δvph <dig>  <cit> .

the vacuolar atpase complex is the major contributor in regulating organelle ph, specifically between the cytosol and vacuolar lumen  <cit> . this action is intrinsically connected to cellular ion homeostasis , as well as proteolytic activation , endocytosis, and vacuole fusion  <cit> . furthermore, intracellular ph and ca2+ ion concentrations as well as direct interaction of the v-atpase complex with the actin cytoskeleton are implicated in bud formation and polarized growth during cell cycle  <cit> . in relation to the vacuole’s lytic function, vam <dig>  encoding the syntaxin-like protein vam3p  is responsible for the correct trafficking and processing of proteinases a, b and carboxypeptidase y and maturation of alkaline phosphatase  <cit> . the relevance of vam3p to fermentation outcome and tolerance of stress  is highlighted by the protracted fermentation of the Δvam <dig> mutant  and growth sensitivity towards these stress parameters .

the importance of the assembly and function of the v-atpase complex during fermentation, was highlighted by the number of genes identified . these encode either the subunits of the v <dig> peripheral membrane and v <dig> integral membrane domains, or the assembly factors including the rave complex, which are required for the reversible assembly and disassembly into the free v <dig> and v <dig> domains, in response to glucose  <cit> . the assembly of v-atpase is thought to prevent cytosolic acidification when metabolism is active, as protons are sequestered in the vacuolar lumen by the v-atpase. this is particularly relevant in high sugar fermentation, when the plasma membrane bound pump pma1p, the principal regulator of cytosolic ph, is transiently inhibited  <cit> . as glucose becomes limited, the disassembly of some v-atpase complexes is thought to conserve atp, as atp hydrolysis is absent in the isolated v <dig> domain. the role of vacuolar atpase in fermentation is supported by previous research showing deletion of structural genes resulting in growth sensitivity to ethanol  and hyperosmolarity due to high concentrations of glucose . how these differences relate to the ph-dependent growth of vma  deletants  <cit>  is unclear. whilst vma deletants, through the loss of v-atpase activity, exhibit growth sensitivity at high ph  or high extracellular calcium and zinc, and reportedly are unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, they are able to grow under acidic conditions  albeit slower than the wild type  <cit> . in this study, the mutants were able to grow in cdgjm_ <dig>  after an extended lag period yet only reached 60-80% of the parent biomass . the ability of these cells to grow even in the presence of initially high sugar and acid and later, increasing ethanol, is strong evidence that vacuolar acidification by this enzyme complex is not the only mechanism involved. yeast possess additional, and yet unidentified independent mechanisms to acidify the endosomal compartments including the vacuole. we have preliminary microscopy data using 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate which supports this notion. specifically, early in fermentation  vacuolar acidification, as anticipated, was reduced in a Δvma <dig> mutant compared to the parent by <dig>  however, after  <dig> h and  <dig> h, by which time fermentation was progressing well, vacuolar acidification was restored in the mutant . recently, vacuolar acidification, particularly the proton dependent storage of neutral amino acids rather than protein degradation in the vacuole, has also been linked to chronological aging  <cit> . the authors proposed that age-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is a result of decreased vacuolar acidification in aging mother cells, and the regeneration of vacuolar acidification in budding daughter cells, is coincidental with rejuvenation of lifespan. this network between the vacuole and mitochondria, thought to be mediated by nutrient-sensing pathways such as pka, sch <dig> and tor  <cit> , is important given that fermentation occurs over an extended time-frame, primarily by stationary phase cells which are progressively aging.

several proposed mechanisms to maintain vacuolar ph independent of v-atpase include passive diffusion and dissociation of weak acids, endocytic internalisation of acid equivalents or pma1p itself  <cit> , and ammonium ions acting as protonophores after uptake  <cit> . these mechanisms would enable growth under acidic conditions through ph equilibration across the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane, maintaining the intracellular ph gradient between the cytosol and vacuole, relative to the outside. this process is vital to cell adaption to fermentation associated stresses, and allowing for complete sugar catabolism albeit at a slower rate. whilst some of these alternative mechanisms may play a role normally in ph regulation, v-atpase is the principal proton pump proposed to protect yeast from heat stress  <cit> , alcohol stress  <cit> , osmotic stress  <cit> , and acid stress  <cit>  associated with fermentation, as well as against stresses of air-drying  <cit> . the latter is important in this context since commercial wine yeast is generally supplied as active dried yeast.

whilst there are a myriad of processes and signalling cascades related to stress response, it is only recently that the inter-relationships are being elucidated. for example v-atpase and the high-osmolarity glycerol  response pathway are proposed to function in parallel, as adaptive mechanisms to prevent salt toxicity under salt induced stress  <cit> . both pathways are crucial for successful sugar fermentation, with not only vma mutants being identified but also the genes for hog1p and its activator, pbs2p. it is possible that communication between such processes as vacuolar acidification , protein trafficking and turnover, and the tor and hog signalling pathways is through inositol-containing lipids in stress response signaling  <cit> , in response to stress adaptation.

microautophagy and the ego/gse complex and fermentation
meh <dig> and slm <dig> encode  <dig> of the  <dig> subunits of the ego complex and deletion of either severely affected fermentation in this study . with the third component, gtr2p, the ego complex is a vacuolar membrane-associated protein complex required for activation of microautophagy  <cit>  through its function as an activator of the nitrogen regulatory torc <dig>  complex  <cit> . in this study tco <dig> was also identified as a feg, with Δtco <dig> increasing fermentation duration by 43%. meh1p and slm4p are also members of the gse  complex, a gtpase complex required for intracellular sorting of gap1p out of the endosome, for eventual delivery to the plasma membrane  <cit> . the gse complex is also composed of two small gtpases  and ltv1p, which do not have a critical role in fermentation . these findings suggest that meh <dig> and slm <dig> have a major role in fermentation, through vacuolar acidification , probably through amino acid uptake into the vacuole, microautophagy and protein sorting of gap1p.

microautophagy and the ego/gse complex have been previously implicated in mechanisms allowing yeast cells to grow under low temperature and high pressure  <cit> . abe and minegishi  <cit>  proposed that the ego/gse complex may contribute to cell surface delivery of amino acid permeases under such conditions, given the marked defect in histidine, leucine and lysine uptake in the ego/gse complex mutants  and Δslm <dig> ), upon high pressure and low temperature incubation.

as mentioned, the ego complex is involved in nitrogen sensing via its activation of the torc <dig> complex, such that ego monitors intracellular levels of leucine and glutamine . the inability to activate torc <dig> during fermentation may result in fermentation arrest via several processes in which torc <dig> is involved: the regulation of amino acid uptake, early glycolysis or induction of autophagy .

it is known that autophagy is triggered by nutritional stress, specifically carbon and nitrogen depletion, and is induced as a prelude to autolysis in yeast conducting the secondary fermentation of sparkling wine production  <cit> . autophagy is critical for fermentation outcome in primary fermentation as shown in our study, with  <dig> related genes identified as fegs. in a recent study, piggott et al.  <cit>  looked at competitive fitness  during a 12-day fermentation of a deletion library pool  in synthetic grape juice. autophagy and ubiquitination were enriched in the dataset with respect to reduced fitness. however, our datasets for these go terms are very different, with only  <dig> genes in common for autophagy; , snx4/atg <dig> , cis/atg <dig> ). other contradictions were the observations for Δdoa <dig> and Δpex <dig>  deletion of doa <dig>  did not result in reduced competitive fitness  <cit> , contrary to our findings, wherebyΔdoa <dig> resulted in stuck fermentation. another anomaly was the finding that Δpex <dig>  resulted in increased fitness  <cit> , implying that fermentation would be either similar to the parent or faster. the recent revelation that autophagy occurs not only during starvation but very early in fermentation  <cit> , in response to as yet unknown stresses, alludes to the importance of the various autophagic responses and would explain the observed protracted fermentation phenotype in such mutants in our study.

it is evident that a number of mechanisms involving a myriad of genes are involved in the adaptive response to the major stressors encountered during high sugar fermentation as such only some of these have been discussed to in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports on the identification of  <dig> genes whose deletion leads to fermentations that are protracted  or arrested . together, the  <dig> genes are referred to as fermentation essential genes, and are representative of the ‘fermentome’; a dataset of genes  which modulate fermentation. the importance of the feg is further supported through their presence in two fermentation relevant databases, lit_fryg and sgd_fryg , collated as part of this study. these datasets are by no means complete, but will be expanded upon as new datasets become available.

in this study we have built upon the understanding of a group of key genes within fermentation. we have identified several cellular processes essential for response and adaptation to a physiologically stressful environment in yeast, namely maintenance of vacuolar acidification, microautophagy and sugar related signalling. whilst individual biological processes are alluded to with respect to fermentation, the question remains; how do these different sensors, signals and cellular responses interact with each other? a systems biology approach allows us to look at what appear to be unrelated processes, together as a ‘network’ or ‘matrix’, in a holistic approach, as well as the traditional reductionist approach  <cit> . by taking such a perspective on wine fermentation, we have gained a better understanding of a fundamental biochemical pathway. this understanding allows design of new industrial yeast strains better suited to specific industrial processes. for example demonstration for the importance of ion homeostasis and intracellular ph maintenance raises the possibility that directed evolution could be used to generate new strains using a low ph environment as the selective pressure.
