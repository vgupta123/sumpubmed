BACKGROUND
since plants use sunlight as their primary source of energy they have evolved mechanisms of light sensing in order to optimally adjust their growth and development accordingly. light-adapted responses are particularly obvious during seedling growth. dark-grown seedlings usually exist under soil cover and therefore respond with etiolation, showing a long hypocotyl, small and closed cotyledons, an apical hook and a lack of chlorophyll synthesis. light-grown seedlings, in contrast, are green and exhibit a short hypocotyl, open, expanded and green cotyledons and no apical hook. other light-induced responses include phototropism, leaf expansion, the shade avoidance response and photoperiodic flowering  <cit> . to sense the light, plants have several classes of photoreceptors: the red  and far-red  sensing phytochromes, the blue /uv-a responsive cryptochromes, phototropins and zeitlupe family members and the recently identified uv-b sensing uv-resistance locus  <dig>  protein  <cit> .

the molecular events during light signal transduction are best understood in the model species arabidopsis. after activation by light, phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors inhibit the activity of a key negative regulator of light signal transduction, the cullin <dig> -dependent e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex constitutively photomorphogenic1/suppressor of phya- <dig> . in darkness, cop1/spa acts to ubiquitinate activators of the light response, such as the transcription factors elongated hypocotyl <dig> , long hypocotyl in fr  <dig> , b-box domain proteins  proteins, production of anthocyanin pigment <dig>  and pap <dig> as well as several photoreceptors, thereby targeting them for degradation in the proteasome. in light-grown plants, in contrast, cop1/spa activity is suppressed and the target proteins can accumulate and mediate light-regulated gene expression and photomorphogenesis  <cit> . hence, mutants defective in cop <dig> or in all four members of the spa gene family show constitutive photomorphogenesis, exhibiting features of light-grown seedlings in complete darkness  <cit> . besides controling seedling growth in response to light, the cop1/spa complex is involved in multiple other light-induced responses, such as anthocyanin biosynthesis, leaf expansion, shade avoidance responses and photoperiodic flowering  <cit> . cop1/spa also acts downstream of the uv-b receptor uvr <dig>  but in contrast to r and b signaling - where cop <dig> acts as a repressor of light signaling - cop1/spa functions as a positive regulator of the uv-b response  <cit> .

the cop1/spa complex likely forms a tetramer with two cop <dig> and two spa proteins. cop <dig> and spa proteins interact with each other via their respective coiled-coil domains  <cit> . cop <dig> and the four spa proteins  share further structural similarity in that they contain related c-terminal wd-repeat domains which have dual roles in substrate recruitment and binding of damaged dna-binding protein <dig>  of the cul <dig> complex  <cit> . in their n-termini, cop <dig> and spa proteins have distinct sequences, with cop <dig> containing a ring finger domain and spa proteins carrying a kinase-like domain  <cit> . the mechanisms involved in light-mediated inhibition of cop1/spa activity are not well understood but likely involve light-induced interaction of cryptochromes with spa <dig>  light-induced degradation of spa <dig> and spa <dig> as well as light-mediated nuclear exclusion of cop <dig>  <cit> .

the four spa proteins share highest sequence similarity to each other in their wd-repeat domain. sequence conservation of the n-terminal domain is relatively low and mostly limited to the kinase-like domain. based on sequence similarity, the four spa proteins fall into two subgroups with spa <dig> and spa <dig> forming one subgroup and spa <dig> and spa <dig> forming the other subgroup  <cit> . genetic analysis of spa mutants indicated that the four spa genes have partly redundant but also distinct functions in plant growth and development  <cit> .

cop <dig> functions have also been described in other flowering plant species. in rice, the cop <dig> ortholog peter pan syndrome <dig>  shortens the juvenile phase, a phenotype not reported for arabidopsis, and delays flowering in short and long day  <cit> . the cop <dig> ortholog of pea, light-independent photomorhogenesis <dig> , regulates seedling growth by affecting gibberellic acid levels  <cit> . in apple, mdcop <dig> affects anthocyanin levels in the fruit peel  <cit> . cop <dig> also exists in non-plant lineages, e.g. humans, where hcop <dig> acts as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase to control the protein stability of a number of transcription factors, e.g. p <dig> or cjun  <cit> . spa genes, in contrast, appear to be specific to plants, which indicates that human cop <dig> functions without a need for spa proteins. this suggests that spa genes might have evolved to place cop <dig> activity under the control of light. indeed, the n-terminus of spa <dig> was shown to be involved in the blue-light dependent interaction of spa <dig> with cryptochrome photoreceptors  <cit> .

whole genome sequencing has shown that cop <dig> and spa genes exist in early diverged land plants, such as in the moss physcomitrella patens. there are a number of light responses known in physcomitrella, such as chloroplast movement, phototropism, caulonema branching and gametophore growth  <cit>  as well as uv-b responses akin to those in arabidopsis  <cit> . while cop <dig> is a single copy gene in rice and arabidopsis  <cit> , genome sequence information predicted a total of nine paralogs in p. patens <cit> . both the rice and physcomitrella genomes contain two spa-related genes each  <cit> . physcomitrella has functional phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors  <cit> , allowing the possibility that ppcop <dig> and ppspa genes may also function in light signal transduction in physcomitrella.

to address the evolutionary conservation of cop <dig> and spa protein sequences, we expressed cop <dig> and spa coding sequences from rice and physcomitrella in the respective cop <dig> and spa mutant backgrounds of arabidopsis. our results show that cop <dig> sequences are functionally much more conserved than spa sequences, suggesting that gene duplication of spa genes in the flowering plant lineage has contributed to divergence of spa gene functions.

RESULTS
a comparison of physcomitrella, rice and arabidopsis cop <dig> and spa protein sequences
based on the v <dig>  genome annotation currently available  <cit> , the physcomitrella genome contains  <dig> cop1-like genes , as was predicted previously based on v <dig>   <cit> . the predicted ppcop <dig> protein sequences share 61-82% amino acid sequence identity among each other and 55-64% amino acid sequence identity with the arabidopsis cop <dig> protein. the cop <dig> ortholog from rice  and arabidopsis cop <dig> share approx. 70% identical amino acids. like arabidopsis cop <dig>  all predicted ppcop <dig> proteins and oscop <dig> contain a ring finger motif, at least one coiled-coil domain and a wd <dig> repeat domain .

while the cop <dig> gene family has expanded in physcomitrella as compared to a single cop <dig> gene reported in flowering plant species, there are only two predicted spa genes in physcomitrella. these two ppspa genes are very similar to each other , suggesting that they represent recent duplication events based on an ortholog of atspa1/ <dig> . we named the two physcomitrella spa genes ppspaa  and ppspab . there are two predicted rice spa proteins of which each groups with one subclass from arabidopsis  , evidencing that two paralogs were already present in the last common ancestor of monocots and dicots. the spa1/spa2-like rice spa was more similar to arabidopsis spa <dig> than to arabidopsis spa <dig>  we therefore refer to this rice spa as rice spa1-like or osspa <dig> . the predicted spa3/spa4-like spa from rice equally resembles arabidopsis spa <dig> and spa <dig> protein sequences. we therefore refer to it as rice spa3/4-like or osspa3/ <dig> . the predicted domain structures of physcomitrella and rice spa proteins are similar to those from arabidopsis spa proteins: they all contain an n-terminal kinase-like domain, a coiled-coil domain and seven wd40-repeats . similar to arabidopsis spa proteins, the kinase-like domains from rice and physcomitrella spa proteins share only limited sequence conservation with bona fide ser/thr kinase consensus motifs because amino acid residues that are normally highly conserved in ser/thr kinases are not conserved in ppspa and osspa proteins. nevertheless, sequences in the kinase-like domain that are conserved among the four arabidopsis spa proteins are also highly conserved in osspa and ppspa proteins . all spa sequences in arabidopsis, rice and physcomitrella contain a predicted coiled-coil domain , though the sequence of the respective coiled-coil domain is not strongly conserved among arabidopsis, rice or physcomitrella spa proteins. this suggests a structural rather than sequence-based conservation of this domain in the spa proteins. the spa protein sequences are most conserved within the wd40-repeat domain, with physcomitrella spaa and spab showing 65% amino acid identity with atspa <dig> - compared with 42% when aligning the complete protein sequences.

rice and physcomitrella also contain predicted orthologs of the arabidopsis rup genes. arabidopsis rup proteins consist of cop1/spa-like wd <dig> repeats and function as negative regulators of uv-b signaling  <cit> . the rice genome contains  <dig> ortholog of rup, while physcomitrella has two predicted rups .

functional analysis of cop1-like proteins from rice and physcomitrella in the hypomorphic cop1- <dig> mutant of arabidopsis
in order to address the evolutionary conservation of cop <dig> and spa function, we expressed the coding sequence of physcomitrella, rice and - as a control - arabidopsis cop <dig> and spa genes in transgenic arabidopsis cop <dig> and spa mutants, respectively, to subsequently evaluate whether the transgenes complement the respective mutant phenotypes. though protein detection in the transgenic plants is desirable, we did not add an epitope tag to the coding sequence because a tag might negatively affect protein function. among the nine ppcop <dig> genes, we chose the one with the highest sequence similarity to atcop <dig>  based on blast scores, for the complementation study . the coding sequences of oscop <dig>  ppcop1a and atcop <dig> were placed under the control of the 35s constitutive promoter and introduced into the hypomorphic cop1- <dig> mutant and into the cop1- <dig> null mutant of arabidopsis. while the cop <dig> null mutant is seedling lethal, the cop1- <dig> mutant is viable, producing a truncated cop <dig> protein lacking the c-terminal wd-repeat domain  <cit> .

cop1- <dig> mutant seedlings undergo constitutive photomorphogenesis in darkness, exhibiting short hypocotyls and open cotyledons . transgenic cop1- <dig> seedlings expressing the arabidopsis cop <dig> gene or rice cop <dig> ortholog fully etiolated in darkness and thus resembled the wild type. hence, atcop <dig> and oscop <dig> fully complemented the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype in darkness. transgenic cop1- <dig> seedlings carrying the ppcop1a transgene showed a partial rescue of the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype in darkness: ppcop1a lines exhibited a longer hypocotyl than cop1- <dig> in darkness but failed to fully etiolate, as indicated by the open cotyledons and the lack of an apical hook . of  <dig> independent ppcop1a lines investigated, none showed a full rescue of the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype in darkness. when grown in light of low to intermediate fluence rates, cop1- <dig> mutant seedlings exhibited a shorter hypocotyl than the wild type . this mutant phenotype was similarly complemented by all three transgenes, atcop <dig>  oscop <dig> and ppcop1a .

besides the constitutive photomorphogenesis in seedlings, cop1- <dig> mutants exhibit mutant phenotypes in the adult plant: cop1- <dig> mutant plants are small and dwarfed and they flower earlier than the wild type, particularly under short day conditions  <cit> . transgenic atcop <dig>  oscop <dig> and ppcop1a cop1- <dig> mutant lines were similar in size as the wild type and flowered at a similar time as the wild type . for each of the three transgenes, about half of the transgenic t <dig> plants showed full rescue of the cop1- <dig> mutant adult phenotypes . hence, oscop <dig> and ppcop1a, like atcop <dig>  were able to fully complement the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotypes in adult plants.

functional analysis of cop1–like proteins from rice and physcomitrella in the cop1- <dig> null mutant of arabidopsis
since the cop1- <dig> mutant allele expresses a truncated cop <dig> protein retaining the n-terminal part of cop <dig> including the coiled-coil domain  <cit> , rescue of the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype by expression of oscop <dig> or ppcop1a might depend on the presence of the truncated cop1- <dig> protein, especially since the retained coiled-coil domain might allow protein-protein interaction with oscop <dig> and ppcop1a. we therefore introduced the transgenes also into the cop1- <dig> null mutant background by transforming cop1-5/+plants and by crossing transgenic cop1- <dig> mutants with cop1-5/+plants. homozygous cop1- <dig>  mutant seeds in the progeny could be easily recognized by their black seed color, though they mostly failed to germinate  <cit> . assuming mendelian segregation of the seedling-lethal cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype, the penotypic effect of the transgenes should be analyzable in the respective t <dig> generations based on the segregation ratio of mutant and wild-type phenotypes. however, we found a much reduced transmission frequency of the cop1- <dig> mutant allele when compared to the cop <dig> wild-type allele, thus making the analysis of segregating populations ambiguous. we therefore generated homozygous cop1- <dig> mutant lines that were also homozygous for the respective transgene. figure 3a shows that atcop <dig> and oscop <dig> fully restored a wild-type phenotype in dark-grown homozygous cop1- <dig> mutant seedlings. hence, the atcop <dig> and oscop <dig> transgenes not only rescued the seedling-lethal phenotype of cop1- <dig> but also fully complemented its fusca phenotype of constitutive photomorphogenesis and strong anthocyanin production which was described for strong cop <dig> alleles  <cit> . ppcop1a cop1- <dig> seedlings, in contrast, showed open cotyledons and a slightly shorter hypocotyl than the wild type when grown in darkness . thus, expression of ppcop1a resulted in partial complementation of the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype. in light-grown seedlings, the control construct atcop <dig> fully complemented the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype. in contrast, b- and fr-grown oscop <dig> cop1- <dig> and ppcop1a cop1- <dig> seedlings were even taller than wild-type seedlings, especially at higher fluence rates, indicating a reduced response to b and fr when compared to the wild type . in r, all transgenic seedlings behaved similar to the wild type .

since all three transgenes rescued the seedling-lethal phenotype of cop1- <dig>  we were able to analyze the activity of the transgene also in the adult stage. transgenic oscop <dig> cop1- <dig>  ppcop1a cop1- <dig> and atcop <dig> cop1- <dig> plants were of similar size as the wild type . with respect to flowering time, transgenic atcop <dig> cop1- <dig> lines flowered at a similar time as the ws wild type while transgenic oscop <dig> cop1- <dig> and, in particular, ppcop1a cop1- <dig> lines flowered earlier than the wild type and the atcop <dig> cop1- <dig> transgenic lines . these results indicate that the cop <dig> sequences from rice and physcomitrella only partially rescued this aspect of the cop1- <dig> mutant phenotype.

rice and physcomitrella spa protein-coding sequences do not complement the light hypersensitivity-phenotype of the arabidopsis spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> triple mutant
to analyze functional conservation of rice and physcomitrella spa1-related protein-coding sequences we expressed osspa <dig> and ppspab orfs in an arabidopsis spa mutant. the two physcomitrella spa proteins, spaa and spab are highly similar to each other  and both share equal sequence similarity to the arabidopsis spa <dig>  we therefore chose only one of these spas, spab, for our analyses. as controls, we included the arabidopsis spa <dig> and spa <dig> orfs because these two spas are representative for the partially distinct functions of the four spa genes  <cit> . we transformed these constructs into the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> triple mutant because this mutant is a viable spa mutant showing defects in multiple phenotypes including seedling deetiolation, leaf expansion and flowering time control  <cit> . initially, we expressed the spa coding sequences under the control of the 35s promoter. however, the arabidopsis 35s::atspa <dig> and 35s::atspa <dig> constructs produced very low complementation rates  in the spa triple mutant, an observation we had made before  <cit> . we therefore proceeded to express the respective spa coding sequences under the control of the endogenous arabidopsis atspa <dig> and atspa <dig> 5´ and 3´ regulatory sequences which previously produced very high complementation rates among transgenic spa mutant plants   <cit> . for linguistic simplicity, we will refer to these regulatory sequences as ´promoters´ from now on.

spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> triple mutant seedlings etiolate normally in darkness, but have a severely reduced hypocotyl length in weak light when compared to the wild type. hence, this mutant is strongly hypersensitive to light . expression of atspa <dig> from the atspa <dig> promoter fully restored the spa <dig> spa <dig> phenotype in the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant, thus reflecting the activity of the native spa <dig> gene. in contrast, expression of rice osspa <dig> or physcomitrella ppspab from the atspa <dig> promoter did not alter the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant seedling phenotype in any of the  <dig> independent transgenic lines analyzed for each construct . similarly, when ppspab was expressed from the arabidopsis atspa <dig> promoter, no change in the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant phenotype was observed, while expression of the control construct atspa4::atspa <dig> caused an elongation of the hypocotyl when compared to the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> progenitor, though the effect of atspa4::atspa <dig> was consistently weaker than that of atspa1::atspa <dig>  as expected  <cit> .

in the adult stage, none of the constructs containing the osspa <dig> or ppspab coding sequences complemented the dwarfism or the early flowering time of the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant . expression of the control constructs atspa1::atspa <dig> or atspa4::atspa <dig>  in contrast, rescued these facets of the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant phenotype to the expected degree  <cit> .

to confirm that osspa <dig> and ppspab genes are indeed expressed in the transgenic plants, we analyzed spa transcript levels by semiquantitative rt-pcr. figure  <dig> shows that all transgenes were expressed. this indicates that the failure of osspa <dig> and ppspab coding sequences to complement the spa triple mutant phenotype was not caused by a lack of expression of the respective spa genes.

functional analysis of spa orthologs from rice and physcomitrella in the constitutively photomorphogenic spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant of arabidopsis
since arabidopsis spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant seedlings analyzed above etiolate normally in darkness, this background precludes a genetic complementation analysis in dark-grown seedlings. we therefore introduced the spa constructs also into the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> triple mutant which undergoes constitutive seedling photomorphogenesis in darkness , while it develops normally as an adult plant  <cit> .

expression of the control constructs  fully complemented the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant phenotype in darkness: all of the atspa1::atspa <dig> lines  and most of the atspa4::atspa <dig> lines  exhibited normal skotomorphogenesis in darkness . when expressing the rice spa <dig> , several transgenic lines showed partial  or full  complementation of the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant phenotype in darkness . hence, osspa <dig> appears to be functional in arabidopsis, though at a much reduced efficiency when compared to atspa <dig>  in contrast, none of the  <dig> transgenic lines expressing physcomitrella ppspab under the atspa <dig> or atspa <dig> promoters showed any rescue of the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant phenotype: these transgenic spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> seedlings underwent constitutive photomorphogenesis in darkness very similar to the spa <dig> spa <dig> spa <dig> mutant progenitor . hence, ppspab was non-functional in arabidopsis. again, all transgenes were expressed in the respective transgenic lines, as indicated by the presence of the transgene-encoded transcripts .

discussion
the cop1/spa complex of arabidopsis is a well-characterized key negative regulator that actively suppresses the light signaling cascade in dark-grown plants by ubiquitinating transcription factors which mediate the various light responses. the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity is conserved in the mammalian ortholog of cop <dig> which, however, appears to function without a need for spa proteins since spa genes appear to be specific to plants. spa protein sequences are distinct from cop <dig> in that they carry a kinase-like domain in the n-terminus  <cit> . this kinase-like domain is conserved in physcomitrella, rice and arabidopsis spa proteins and shows a similar divergence in sequence from bona fide ser/thr kinase motifs in all three species. this finding suggests on one hand that this kinase-like domain is of functional importance - though its exact role has so far remained elusive  <cit>  - and on the other hand that early in land plant evolution this domain was already divergent in sequence from normal protein kinases.

our functional analysis clearly shows that ppcop1a from physcomitrella is able to mostly replace the functions of cop <dig> in arabidopsis. similarly, rice oscop <dig> was able to mostly complement all aspects of the arabidopsis cop <dig> mutant phenotype. these findings suggest that cop <dig> is under strong negative selection in seed plants. physcomitrella ppspab, in contrast, was incapable of complementing any of the spa mutant phenotypes in transgenic arabidopsis, strongly suggesting that the ppspab protein is non-functional in arabidopsis. similarly, expression of the rice osspa <dig> protein in arabidopsis spa mutants failed to complement any phenotypes of light-grown spa mutant plants and complemented the phenotype of dark-grown seedlings at a much reduced efficiency. these results suggest that spa-like sequences underwent considerable functional divergence during evolution. however, since we cannot determine the ppspab and osspa <dig> protein levels in the transgenic arabidopsis plants we cannot exclude the possibility that the apparent inactivity of ppspab and osspa <dig> in arabidopsis are due to inefficient translation of the respective mrnas or due to instability of the respective proteins in arabidopsis when compared to the native arabidopsis spa <dig> protein. to fully understand the functional conservation between spa <dig> from moss, rice and arabidopsis, it will also be necessary to genetically identify osspa <dig> and ppspa <dig> function in rice and physcomitrella, respectively. moreover, a protein-protein interaction analysis among the respective cop <dig> and spa orthologs will be helpful in analyzing osspa <dig> and ppspab activity in arabidopsis.

we can only speculate why the cop <dig> gene appears to be subject to much less functional divergence than spa <dig>  one likely reason is the fact that cop <dig> is a single-copy gene in flowering plants while spa proteins are encoded by a small gene family comprising two to four members. gene duplication is a powerful driving force of neo- and subfunctionalization during plant evolution  <cit> . the four spa genes of arabidopsis are indeed not fully redundant but have partially distinct functions during arabidopsis development  <cit> . at least some of the functional divergence, the one between arabidopsis spa <dig> and spa <dig>  has been mapped to the respective spa protein sequence rather than the promoter sequences  <cit> . hence, evidence strongly suggests that the four arabidopsis spa proteins are not identical in function but provide some degree of specificity to the cop1/spa e <dig> ligase activity. the failure of ppspab and osspa <dig> to fully replace atspa <dig> in arabidopsis supports that such functional divergence has occurred in the course of land plant evolution. while this is very reasonable, it is nevertheless significant that cop <dig> coding sequences did not functionally co-diverge with spa sequences, especially considering that both proteins carry very similar wd40-repeat domains in their c-termini which both are able to bind and thereby recognize the same substrate proteins  <cit> . hence, cop <dig> must provide a core function to the cop1/spa complex that hinders evolutionary divergence, and this core function is likely modified by divergent spa proteins.

osspa <dig> was capable of restoring a wild-type phenotype in dark-grown spa triple mutant seedlings – though at low efficiency - but not in light-grown seedlings or adult plants. we consider two possible scenarios to explain this dark-specific complementation by osspa1: osspa <dig> activity may be reduced when compared to atspa <dig> and therefore be solely sufficient to restore spa function in darkness but not in the light. this would be consistent with previous observations showing that mutations in a single spa gene caused a mutant phenotype only in the light but not in darkness  <cit> . hence, full spa activity is much more critical in light-grown seedlings than in dark-grown seedlings, probably because the light-induced inactivation of the cop1/spa complex causes additional stress on the activity of the complex. alternatively, osspa <dig> may be hyperinactivated by arabidopsis photoreceptors and, therefore, lack any activity in the light. this behavior is found in the arabidopsis spa <dig> protein which also shows high activity primarily in dark-grown seedlings  <cit> . though the osspa <dig> sequence is more similar to arabidopsis spa <dig> than to spa <dig>  we do not exclude this possibility. knocking out the osspa <dig> gene in rice would allow to distinguish between these two possibilities.

the degree of complementation by cop <dig> orthologs varied with respect to the different aspects of the cop <dig> mutant phenotype. most evidently, expression of oscop <dig> or ppcop1a in light-grown cop1- <dig> seedlings caused a reduced response to b and fr, a phenotype that is reminiscent of atcop <dig> overexpression rather than of reduced cop <dig> activity. this observation suggests that oscop <dig> and ppcop1a maintain higher activity in the light than atcop <dig> and are therefore incompletely inactivated by arabidopsis photoreceptors when compared to the native arabidopsis cop <dig> protein. hence, photoreceptor and cop <dig> sequences appear to have co-evolved to allow optimal adaptation of seedling growth to the ambient light environment. when analyzing adult growth and development, ppcop1a and oscop <dig> fully complemented the cop1- <dig> leaf expansion phenotype while they only partially complemented the early-flowering phenotype of cop1- <dig>  since these phenotypes are mediated by distinct substrates, it is evident that the cop1-like proteins from rice and physcomitrella do not polyubiquitinate all substrates of arabidopsis cop <dig> equally well. hence, functional conservation of cop <dig> may have varied with respect to the different substrates of cop <dig>  orthologs of known cop1/spa substrates exist in p. patens, such as two pphy <dig> and three ppco-like  proteins  <cit> . a role of pphy <dig> in moss light responses was described  <cit> . hence, if ppcop1a acts as a light-regulated ubiquitin ligase in mosses as well, it may indeed mediate degradation of the pphy <dig> protein. in the future, it will be interesting to elucidate whether there is a cop1/spa e <dig> ligase in physcomitrella and, if so, which substrates are recognized.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that cop <dig> protein sequences from physcomitrella, rice and arabidopsis are functionally conserved, while the sequences of the spa proteins showed considerable functional divergence. this may - at least in part - reflect the fact that cop <dig> is a single copy gene in flowering plants, while spa proteins are encoded by a small gene family of two to four members, thus possibly allowing sub- or neofunctionalization. light responses are very distinct in mosses and angiosperms  <cit> . whether these differences reflect distinct signaling pathways including the recruitment of different transcription factors into the light signaling network needs to be resolved.
