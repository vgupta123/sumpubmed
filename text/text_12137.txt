BACKGROUND
in most organisms there are evolutionarily conserved mechanisms in place that minimise the frequency of mismatches introduced during dna replication  <cit> . as plants lack a reserved germ-line, mutation occurring in somatic cells can be transmitted to the next generation. consequently, the need for an effective post-replicative dna repair mechanism is pronounced. the mismatch repair  system is an essential component of this dna repair.

in eukaryotes mmr is undertaken by the muts and mutl homologues . both msh and mlh polypeptides form msh and mlh heterodimeric proteins, respectively, which act together to bind mismatched dna and initiate repair. most eukaryotes have genes encoding six msh proteins, however a seventh msh protein  has been identified in plants  <cit> .

all msh proteins, except msh <dig>  have been shown to act in dna repair and/or recombination during meiosis  <cit> , with each having a specific yet often overlapping role. the msh4–msh <dig> heterodimer has only been reported to be involved in meiotic recombination  <cit> , while the three remaining dimers are involved in both recombination and mmr. the msh2–msh <dig> heterodimer  binds insertion/deletion loop-outs, the msh2–msh <dig> heterodimer  binds base mispairs and small insertion-deletion loop-outs  <cit> , while the msh2–msh <dig> heterodimer  binds base mispairs but not insertion-deletion loop-outs  <cit> . these heterodimers then recruit mlh proteins to initiate mmr.

in addition to roles in mmr and homologous recombination, msh genes are known to be involved in suppression of homoeologous recombination  <cit> . recent research indicates that when two divergent sequences undergo recombination, some msh proteins detect mismatches in the recombination intermediate and the recombination event is subsequently aborted  <cit> . studies in bacteria and yeast, supporting these findings, have shown that inactivation of the mmr system leads to elevated levels of both inter- and intra-specific homoeologous recombination and relaxation of the species barrier  <cit> . using yeast , datta et al. showed that between sequences with less than 10% sequence variation, homoeologous recombination was increased by up to 70-fold upon inactivation of mmr  <cit> . this suppression has also been observed in higher eukaryotes, with studies in plants and humans indicating that proteins involved in mmr play a critical role in suppressing homoeologous recombination  <cit> . in yeast, msh <dig> and its two binding partners msh <dig> and msh <dig> mediate the suppression of homoeologous recombination  <cit> . in plants msh <dig> can also suppress homoeologous recombination  <cit> , implicating the plant specific msh <dig> in this process since the two polypeptides form a heterodimer.

support for this hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that msh <dig> has been mapped to a locus in wheat known to affect homoeologous recombination  <cit> . the bread wheat  genomes contain several loci that are known to be involved in the suppression of homoeologous recombination. historically, the two main loci are ph <dig> and ph <dig> . two chinese spring derived mutants display the ph <dig> phenotype. one of these, ph2a, was generated via x-ray irradiation and contains a d genome deletion  <cit> . the other, ph2b, is a chemically induced mutation, thought to be a single nucleotide polymorphism  or a small insertion or deletion   <cit> . the ph2b mutant  therefore suggests that ph <dig> is a single gene located on the short arm of chromosome 3d  <cit> . southern analysis using nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines showed that one copy of msh <dig> resides on the short arm of chromosomes 3a, 3b and 3d  <cit> . furthermore, hybridisation of a tamsh <dig> probe to genomic dna from chinese spring and ph2a lines indicated that the copy on chromosome 3d is located in the region deleted in the ph2a mutant  <cit> .

given the known involvement of msh genes in the suppression of homoeologous recombination and the mapped location of tamsh <dig> to the ph <dig> locus in bread wheat, this gene is a strong ph <dig> candidate. to understand the role of msh <dig> in meiotic recombination in plants, additional research into this important candidate gene is necessary. in a wider context, enhancing meiotic recombination would benefit plant breeders, allowing new strategies for dna introgression from wild crop relatives to domestic breeding lines  <cit> .

the research presented here is divided into two sections. the first part compares cdna sequences from various wheat accessions and mutants. in particular comparisons between the chinese spring d genome copy with the d genome copy from the ph2b mutant were made to determine whether any snps or small indel were present within the known orf of the tamsh <dig> sequence. the second part of the study demonstrates that msh <dig> loss-of-function results in reduced seed set in transgenic barley  plants, and shows for the first time that msh <dig> plays a necessary role in vivo and that expression of this gene is required for wild-type levels of fertility. barley was used for this study, since as it is a diploid it provides a simpler model than wheat and permits an assessment of the role of msh <dig> on recombination processes between homologous chromosomes without the complication of dealing with both homologous and homoeologous chromosomes in wheat.

RESULTS
previous studies in wheat, arabidopsis and maize  have identified msh <dig> as a plant specific member of the msh protein family  <cit> . given that the msh2–msh <dig> heterodimer has a different binding specificity when compared to other msh heterodimers a functionally distinct role for msh <dig> within the plant cell is suggested  <cit> . this study investigated a role for msh <dig> in transgenic barley and compared the three sub-genomic copies of msh <dig> from bread wheat to determine whether any snps or indels could possibly account for the ph <dig> phenotype that has previously been reported previously.

sequencing of tamsh <dig> from bread wheat
three distinct msh <dig> sequences were identified in bread wheat that are representative of the a, b and d genome copies. all three sequences were obtained from wheat meiotic cdna, indicating that each of the three genes is expressed during meiosis. sequence alignment with t. tauschii  was used to determine the sequence belonging to the d genome while sequences from nullisomic-tetrasomic lines were used to distinguish the a and b genomes .

conceptual translation and subsequent alignment of tamsh <dig> nucleotide and protein sequences showed  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity and 95% amino acid identity between the three sub-genomic copies . almost all amino acid differences between the three tamsh <dig> protein sequences were found to be residues that were not conserved amongst other msh <dig> and msh <dig> proteins . however, residue  <dig> from the b genome consensus was a polar serine residue, while all other msh <dig> and msh <dig> proteins and also ecmuts  had non-polar leucine, isoleucine or valine residues . this difference falls in the non-specific dna binding domain that is truncated in msh <dig> proteins. msh <dig> proteins have been shown to bind dna but the significance  of the domain truncation has yet to be determined. biochemical studies into the muts protein family have not uncovered any particular significance of this residue  <cit>  and while possible, it seems unlikely that this amino acid change would result in any major change to protein function.

sequence of msh <dig> from the d genome of the ph2b mutant
the two known ph <dig> mutants in bread wheat, ph2a and ph2b, suggest that ph <dig> may be a single gene located on the d genome. dong and colleagues  <cit>  have previously suggested that msh <dig> may be a candidate for ph <dig>  given that the phenotype observed in the ph2b mutant is believed to be a result of a snp or small insertion/deletion, the d genome copy of msh <dig> from this mutant was sequenced to determine if msh <dig> could be validated as the ph <dig> gene.

three snps were identified between the wild-type chinese spring and ph2b d genome copies of tamsh <dig>  these snps resulted in two changes at the amino acid level . the first polymorphism resulted in a serine to proline change at position  <dig>  a proline is found at this position in the maize msh <dig> orthologue, suggesting that this change is functionally redundant. the second polymorphism resulted in an isoleucine to valine change at residue  <dig>  valine is also present at this position in rice msh <dig> and maize msh <dig> suggesting that this change also results in a functional protein. given the nature of these changes it is unlikely that the ph2b d genome copy of the msh <dig> coding sequence contains any mutations that would result in a non-functional or malfunctioning protein. furthermore, the ph2b d genome copy of msh <dig> was well represented in the meiotic cdna  indicating that this gene is expressed during meiosis. this significantly reduces the possibility of a mutation within the promoter or other regulatory elements leading to the ph <dig> phenotype.

although the ph2b mutation was generated in a chinese spring background, the difference between the ph2b and parental sequence may be due to genetic variation in chinese spring that we and others have observed at several other loci. results from such sequencing efforts suggest that there are several different 'versions' of chinese spring. the differences seen here may also be due to background mutations caused by the chemical mutagenesis of chinese spring that led to the initial identification of the ph2b mutant.

transgenic barley production analysis
over  <dig> independent barley lines, transformed with a wheat msh <dig> double-stranded rnai construct , were generated with a transformation frequency of approximately 11%. when compared to previously published barley transformation experiments  <cit>  that have used the same cultivar , the frequency reported here is considerably higher. both pcr and southern hybridisation were conducted to confirm that each of these lines were positive , with many having a single copy of the hygromycin resistance gene inserted . only 14% of all lines produced had  <dig> or more copies of the hygromycin resistance gene inserted. a characteristic phenotype with many of the t <dig> lines was reduced levels of fertility, as evidenced through lower seed set than the controls that had been transformed with an empty vector containing only the hygromycin resistance gene.

transgenic barley rnai loss-of-function analysis
from the population of transgenic t <dig> lines,  <dig>  were analysed for msh <dig> expression using quantitative real-time pcr . in the majority of these lines expression of the transgene was significantly reduced . in the t <dig> generation two single-copy insertion lines were selected for further expression analysis . these lines were chosen based on their t <dig> expression levels and morphological characteristics which also included reduced seed set and pollen viability. positive segregants from these lines showed significantly reduced msh <dig> expression when compared to null-segregants of the same lines  . a concomitant reduction of expression of msh <dig> was also observed in line  <dig> but not in line  <dig>  there were no significant differences between null and positive segregants in msh <dig> expression .

based on the reduced msh <dig> expression in line  <dig> we investigated the possibility as to whether msh <dig> and/or msh <dig> expression could be affected by non-specific targeting of these genes by rnai mechanisms. to achieve this, sequence identities between the rnai construct and the various msh genes were compared. as sequence information was not available for many of the barley msh genes, rice msh <dig> and msh <dig> sequences were compared to the segment of rice msh <dig> sequence orthologous to that used in the rnai construct. while not ideal, this was considered an appropriate approximation of sequence identity as the presence of all msh genes in both monocots and dicots suggests divergence of msh genes occurred prior to rice/barley divergence  <cit> . this is also supported by previous studies in arabidopsis which indicate that msh <dig> diverged from msh <dig> early in eukaryotic evolution  <cit> . the msh <dig> fragment within the rnai construct showed 53% and 51% sequence identity to msh <dig> and msh <dig>  respectively. furthermore the greatest segment length with the selected sequence for the rnai construct showing 100% identity to either of these two mismatch repair gene family members was only  <dig> bp. in plants a ~ <dig> nt rna with 100% sequence identity is generally needed for rnai to be effective , therefore it is unlikely that the rnai construct would have affected any other members of the msh gene family.

seed set and seed weight
positive segregants of lines  <dig> and  <dig> displayed reduced fertility as evidenced by reduced seed set . in line  <dig> this difference was significant at the 95% confidence level  and in line  <dig> significant to 90% confidence . seed weight  differences between the positive segregants and the nulls for each of these lines  were also statistically significant at the 90% confidence level . these results, taken together with the q-pcr data, indicate that msh <dig> plays an important role in determining plant fertility.

there are two obvious pathways that could lead to reduced fertility with reduction in msh <dig> expression. first, there may be reduced levels of mmr in these plants leading to higher levels of mutation and therefore a reduction in viable seed. secondly, reduced expression could lower the suppression of homologous recombination during meiosis. increased recombination is known to lead to chromosomal instability and a reduction in viable gametes due to translocations and non-disjunction during cell division  <cit> .

based on the q-pcr data reported for the t <dig> transgenics, we cannot rule out the possibility that the reduced level of fertility observed in line  <dig> was affected by the reduction in expression not only of the msh <dig> gene but also of the msh <dig> gene. indeed, similar phenotypes to those observed in this study have been found by hoffman et al.  <cit>  who showed, using a msh <dig> t-dna insertion mutant, that disabling the mmr system in arabidopsis leads to high levels of mutation and reduced fertility within two generations in some lines. however, the reduced fertility observed in line  <dig> of this study can be attributed to the reduction in msh <dig> transcript alone, as there was no significant change in expression level of the msh <dig> transcript. importantly, further experiments will still be needed to distinguish between these possible reasons for reduced fertility, as even in the study reported by hoffman et al.  <cit> , they were not able to show if the observed phenotypes were due to a reduction in mmr, reduced homoeologous recombination or some other mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here indicate that bread wheat contains three functionally conserved copies of msh <dig>  all of which are expressed during meiosis. while snps were identified within the d genome copy of tamsh <dig>  it is unlikely that these amino acid substitutions are responsible for the ph <dig> phenotype. barley plants transformed with an msh <dig> rnai knock-down construct showed a reduction in msh <dig> expression accompanied by reduced fertility when compared to null segregants and wild-type. this is consistent with previous reports, suggesting that msh <dig> plays a role in recombination and dna repair during meiosis  <cit> . reduced seed set in transgenic barley also showed that the in vivo loss of msh <dig> function  is not compensated for by other endogenous msh proteins , indicating a distinct functional role for msh <dig> within the plant cell.
