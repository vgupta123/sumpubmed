BACKGROUND
centrosomes coordinate the cytoplasmic microtubule network serving as the major microtubule-organizing centers in mammalian cells  <cit> . a single centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by the amorphous pericentriolar material . centrioles are cylindrical structures built of nine sets of triplet microtubules, and lie at right angles to each other and in close proximity at one end. the pcm harbors a number of protein complexes, including the γ-tubulin ring complex, which acts as a template for microtubule nucleation. during m phase of the cell cycle, two centrosomes orchestrate the assembly of bipolar mitotic spindles, which is prerequisite for accurate chromosome segregation. aberrations in centrosome numbers, which frequently occur in aggressive human tumors, almost certainly represent one crucial cause of missegregation of chromosomes, leading to a phenotype termed genetic instability  <cit> . therefore, the rigorous control of the duplication cycle of the centrosome is vital for the cell. however, our understanding of the regulation of the centrosome cycle remains incomplete.

the signal transducing gtpase rhoa has been implicated in a variety of cellular responses in mammalian cells, being regulated by dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors  in a cell type- and signal-specific manner  <cit> . dbl family gefs contain dbl homology  and pleckstrin homology  domains in tandem, which are responsible for enhancement of guanine nucleotide exchange on the target gtpase. the dh domain is a catalytic domain whereas the ph domain is thought to be required for the modulation of protein conformation and subcellular localization  <cit> . a well characterized function of rhoa is the regulation of cell division, particularly cytokinesis  <cit> . upon onset of anaphase, the gef ect <dig> activates rhoa, leading to the accumulation of activated rhoa at the cleavage furrow. activated rhoa in turn directs assembly and contraction of the contractile ring through the activation of various downstream effectors, including formin family proteins, the rho-dependent kinase rock and citron kinase. formin family proteins regulate actin polymerization, allowing the formation of the contractile ring. rock and citron kinase are involved in the control of contractile ring ingression and completion of cytokinesis, respectively, through phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chains.

increasing evidence has emerged that rhoa plays a pivotal role not only in cytokinesis, but also in mitosis  <cit> . for instance, rock regulates mother centriole movement in late telophase and exit from mitosis  <cit> . during prophase/prometaphase, rhoa and its gef lfc are required for the assembly of the mitotic spindle  <cit> . separation and positioning of duplicated centrosomes after nuclear envelope breakdown, which are important for correct spindle alignment, may also be regulated by rhoa and rock  <cit> .

the dbl family gef arhgef <dig> was originally identified as the product of the gene associated with slowed nerve-conduction velocities of peripheral nerves  <cit> . however, underlying molecular mechanisms are totally unknown. also, the function of arhgef <dig> in mammalian cell cycle progression remains to be clarified. arhgef <dig> was initially reported to possess a dh domain in its n-terminal portion, but lack the ph domain  <cit> . recently, however, a less conserved ph domain in tandem with the dh domain was identified  <cit>  . c-terminally located two transmembrane domains have also been predicted from amino acid sequence  <cit> . based on the similarity between human and mouse sequences, we identified an additional putative transmembrane domain, which lies immediately adjacent and c-terminal to the original ones . except for the pair of dh and ph domains and putative transmembrane domains, no functional domain structures have been noted for arhgef <dig>  herein, we investigate the role of arhgef <dig> in cell division control and demonstrate that arhgef <dig> regulates the centrosome number through the action on its target rhoa.

RESULTS
involvement of arhgef <dig> in the regulation of mitotic spindle formation
as a first step to clarify the function of arhgef <dig> at a molecular level, we attempted to identify substrate rho family gtpases for putative gef activity of arhgef <dig> by a pull-down assay . in this assay, the activated form of the gtpase accumulated within the cell was precipitated by a probe that selectively recognizes the active form, and visualized by immunoblotting. when co-expressed with a fragment of arhgef <dig> that contains catalytic dh and regulatory ph domains, the activated form of ectopically expressed wild-type rhoa was increased, indicating that arhgef <dig> actually showed gef activity toward rhoa. gef activity of arhgef <dig> was comparable to that of dbl, a previously characterized gef for rhoa. in contrast, gtp loading to rac <dig> and cdc <dig> was not enhanced by arhgef <dig> as previously described . although a previous study demonstrated gef activity of arhgef <dig> toward rhob, we were unable to detect significant gef activity toward rhob . when ectopically expressed in hela cells, a subset of rhoa was indeed co-localized with arhgef <dig> in centrosomes  .

subcellular localization of arhgef <dig> was then determined by immunofluorescent staining . of note, arhgef <dig> was localized, at least in part, in centrosomes visualized by counter staining of γ-tubulin in unsynchronized hela cells in various phases of the cell cycle . such centrosomal localization of arhgef <dig> was also evident at least in g1/s and m phases as demonstrated by using synchronized cell culture . virtually all centrosomes that we detected by γ-tubulin staining were also positive for arhgef <dig>  synchronization of these cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of dna content . therefore, arhgef <dig> may be involved in the control of the cell division cycle.

to gain further insights into the function of arhgef <dig> during cell cycle progression, expression of endogenous arhgef <dig> in hela cells was downregulated by two different sets of sirnas. decrease in the mrna level was confirmed by rt-pcr analysis , and the effect on protein expression was assessed by the use of an epitope-tagged ectopically expressed arhgef <dig> because we were unable to detect endogenous arhgef <dig> by immunoblotting . following synchronization in m phase by nocodazole treatment, aberrant multipolar spindle formation was observed in 30~40% of arhgef10-knockdown cells whereas more than 95% of control sirna-transfected cells showed normal bipolar spindles under the same culture conditions . this aberrant spindle formation was not merely due to nocodazole treatment because g2/m arrest of control sirna-transfected cells by nocodazole did not induce multipolar spindles , and we actually detected multiple centrosomes in mitotic arhgef10-knockdown cells without nocodazole treatment . arhgef10-specific sirna indeed reduced the amount of centrosome-localized arhgef <dig> . interestingly, we reproducibly observed that two centrosomes contain markedly reduced amounts of arhgef <dig> whereas the expression level of arhgef <dig> in the other centrosome was decreased only partly. all mitotic spindle poles in arhgef10-knockdown cells appeared to consist of two centrioles as shown by immunostaining for the centriole marker centrin . each centrosome was indeed positive for pcm markers γ-tubulin, pericentrin and aurora-a .

rhoa regulates mitotic spindle formation downstream of arhgef10
we next examined the involvement of rho family gtpases in arhgef10-dependent regulation of mitotic spindle formation. expression of the arhgef <dig> target rhoa was reduced by specific sirna sets , and the effect on spindle pole formation was examined. similarly to arhgef <dig> knockdown, multiple spindle poles emerged . each spindle pole in fact harbored one centrosome consisting of two centrioles and the pcm as shown by staining of marker proteins . we also tried to see the effect of c <dig> exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates rho proteins, without success due to extensive cell death upon synchronization of the cell . furthermore, multipolar spindle formation induced by knockdown of arhgef <dig> was rescued by ectopic expression of a constitutively activated mutant of rhoa, but not rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  suggesting the involvement of rhoa downstream of arhgef <dig> . rescue by constitutively activated rhoa was incomplete, but comparable to that by the arhgef <dig> sirna #1-resistant catalytic dh domain of arhgef <dig> . the percentage of cells containing multiple mitotic spindle poles shown in figure 3h was lower compared to that in figure 2h because the amount of arhgef <dig> sirna was reduced when introduced with plasmid dnas.

multipolar spindle formation in arhgef10-knockdown cells is not ascribed to defects in cytokinesis
it is important to clarify whether multiple spindle formation in arhgef10-knockdown cells was due to defects in cytokinesis. to this end, we utilized the rock pharmacological inhibitor y- <dig> as a control because rock is intimately involved in the control of cytokinesis downstream of rhoa  <cit> . as a first step, mitotic spindle formation in y-27632-treated cells was examined under conditions similar to those for sirna-mediated knockdown of arhgef <dig>  hela cells were treated with y- <dig> for  <dig> h prior to challenge with nocodazole, and then subjected to synchronization in m phase. y- <dig> induced multiple mitotic spindle formation resembling that observed in arhgef10- or rhoa-knockdown cells , which may be ascribed to aberration in cytokinesis. the percentage of multinucleated cells was indeed increased upon y- <dig> treatment whereas virtually no increase was observed in arhgef10-knockdown cells . fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis also support the notion that y- <dig> treatment, but not arhgef <dig> knockdown, caused multinucleation presumably due to defects incytokinesis.

nocodazole treatment increased 4n and 8n cell populations as expected . transfection of control  or arhgef10-specific # <dig>  sirna did not significantly affect the percentage of multi-nucleated  cells. in contrast, y27632-treated cells showed higher percentage of multi-nucleated  cells . . cleavage furrow formation and cytokinesis were indeed observed in arhgef10-knockdown tripolar cells. in addition, rhoa was indeed accumulated in the midbody in arhgef10-knockdown tripolar as well as control cells. overall, these results suggest that occurrence of multiple centrosomes in arhgef10-knockdown cells may not be due to abnormalities incytokinesis. instead, arhgef <dig> may have a crucial role in the regulation of centrosome duplication considering that arhgef <dig> is localized in centrosomes . if this is the case, aberrant centrosome duplication may occur causing the formation of multiple spindle poles when arhgef <dig> was knocked down.

the kinesin-like motor protein kif3b may regulate arhgef <dig> as a binding partner
through yeast two-hybrid screening for arhgef10-interacting proteins, we isolated a clone encoding the c-terminal portion  of the kinesin-like motor protein kif3b. this portion does not overlap with the microtubule-binding motor domain. the interaction was confirmed by growth on the selection plate  and the β-galactosidase assay . arhgef <dig> and kif3b indeed co-localized in centrosomes in hela cells . the interaction between arhgef <dig> and kif3b was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cos <dig> cells . intriguingly, sirna-mediated knockdown of kif3b also induced multiple spindle poles . each spindle pole indeed contains two centrioles and the pcm similarly to arhgef10- or rhoa-knockdown cells . thus, kif3b may exert a regulatory role in arhgef10-rhoa-mediated control of mitotic spindle formation.

the supernumerary centrosome phenotype was also observed in s phase-arrested osteosarcoma u2os cells when the expression of arhgef <dig>  rhoa or kif3b was reduced
the effect of knockdown of arhgef <dig>  rhoa or kif3b was also examined in osteosarcoma u2os cells arrested in s phase by aphidicolin treatment . supernumerary centrosomes containing a pair of centrioles and the pcm were observed in arhgef10-, rhoa- or kif3b-knockdown cells .

however, when the expression of arhgef <dig>  rhoa or kif3b was reduced, enhanced formation of multiple procentrioles surrounding a parental centriole as reported in plk4-overexpressing cells  <cit>  was not observed .

discussion
in mitotic arhgef10-knockdown cells, we observed multiple spindle poles, each of which contains two centrioles and the pcm. one possible mechanism for the formation of such supernumerary centrosomes is aborted cell division  <cit> . aneuploid cells generated through aberrant mitotic exit contain more than two centrosomes, which may form multipolar spindles in next m phase. initially, we thought that aberrant division of cells lacking arhgef <dig> may frequently occur because rhoa is known to be involved in many facets of mitotic and cytokinetic control. however, the occurrence of multinucleated cells was not affected by arhgef <dig> knockdown in contrast to treatment with a rock inhibitor, which significantly enhanced the formation of multinucleated cells . furthermore, normal ingression of the cleavage furrow was, in fact, detected in arhgef10-knockdown cells as well . therefore, it is not feasible that arhgef <dig> is responsible for rhoa activation in mitosis and cytokinesis. instead, arhgef <dig> may regulate rhoa during interphase.

deregulated centrosome duplication also leads to the formation of multiple centrosomes and multipolar spindles  <cit> . thus, the multi-centrosome phenotype observed in arhgef10-knockdown cells may be ascribed to disorder in centrosome duplication. localization of arhgef <dig> in centrosomes strongly supports this notion. centriole duplication is initiated by the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> around the g1/s transition, concurrent with dna replication, and short daughter centrioles elongate during s and g <dig> phases  <cit> . following completion of centriole elongation at the g2/m transition, centrosome maturation and separation occur, with a pair of centrioles in each centrosome. centrosome duplication must occur precisely once every cell cycle, being inextricably coupled with other cell cycle-dependent events. to ensure this, cells are afforded mechanisms  to limit centriole duplication to once in every cell division cycle and  to limit the number of progenitor centrioles to one per pre-existingcentriole.

plenty of molecules that positively regulate centrosome duplication, including polo-like kinase- <dig>  <cit> , cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  <cit>  and spd- <dig>  <cit> , have been reported. the phenotype termed centriole overduplication  was observed when a positive regulator of centriole duplication, for instance polo-like kinase- <dig>  is overexpressed  <cit>  due to a disordered mechanism to limit the number of progenitor centrioles. the supernumerary centrosome formation described in figure  <dig> is distinct from this phenotype, and therefore, the arhgef10-rhoa pathway may not be responsible for the copy number control of procentrioles duplicated from a single parental centriole.

one major mechanism to limit centriole duplication to once in every cell division cycle involves a protein-digesting enzyme termed separase, which is also responsible for sister chromatid separation  <cit> . in the normal cell division cycle, centrioles are prevented from duplicating again during late s and g <dig> phases, being tightly connected or engaged. at the end of mitosis, the engaged centriole pair becomes dissociated, losing their strict orthogonal orientation. this process, called disengagement, is triggered by the action of separase, and is prerequisite for a new round of centriole duplication  <cit> . thus, intrinsic block to centriole reduplication throughout the cell cycle and timely activation of separase represent a mechanism to ensure that a new round of duplication can occur only after passage through m phase. although speculative, disruption of the arhgef10-rhoa-dependent signaling pathway by knocking down its component may permit an excess cycle of centriole duplication if sustained engagement of centrioles or suppression of separase activity during late s and g <dig> phases requires this pathway. the observation that only two among three centrosomes in arhgef10-knockdown cells exhibit diminished arhgef <dig> expression  may be consistent with the idea that only a centrosome that lacks arhgef <dig> undergoes an excess duplication cycle before mitosis.

multiple mitotic spindles were also observed in cells deficient in the polo-like kinase- <dig> target kizuna  <cit> . unlike kizuna-depleted multipolar cells, however, we did not detect fragmentation of the pcm in arhgef10-knockdown cells, suggesting that the arhgef10-rhoa pathway is not implicated in stabilization of the pcm in early mitotic phase.

in this paper, we further identified the motor protein kif3b as a binding partner of arhgef <dig> . kif3b has been implicated in a variety of physiological responses, including determination of left-right asymmetry  <cit> , axonal transport  <cit> , assembly and maintenance of the excitation-contraction-coupling membranes in skeletal muscle  <cit> , cytokinesis  <cit>  and glucose transport in adipocytes  <cit> . we observed multiple mitotic spindle poles in kif3b-knockdown cells , resembling phenotypes observed following expression of a dominant-negative mutant of kif3b  <cit> . considering that arhgef <dig> associates with kif3b in the centrosome, kif3b may regulate spindle pole formation through the arhgef10-rhoa pathway. kif3b knockdown may also cause supernumerary centrosomes through cytokinesis defects independently of arhgef <dig> because a dominant-negative mutant of kif3b caused chromosomal aneuploidy  <cit> . the mechanisms may be more complicated because it is reported that silencing of another motor protein kifc5a causes centrosome amplification primarily through reduplication and partly as a result of defects incytokinesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
arhgef <dig> is a rhoa gef, which is localized in the centrosome in both g1/s and m phases. arhgef <dig> regulates mitotic spindle formation through the action of rhoa. arhgef10-regulaed rhoa may be implicated in the control of centrosome duplication rather than cytokinesis. the motor protein kif3b is a binding partner of arhgef <dig>  a subset of which is co-localized with arhgef <dig> in the centrosome.

thus, kif3b may regulate arhgef <dig> upstream of rhoa, being involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication.
