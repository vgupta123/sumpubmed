BACKGROUND
a number of research groups have attempted artificial reproduction in various species of eel: a. japonica  <cit> , a. anguilla , a. dieffenbachii  <cit> , a. australis , and a. rostrata  <cit> . some japanese scientists have also overcome major problems associated with developing artificial feeds for larvae and have successfully produced leptocephalus larvae  <cit>  and glass eels  <cit> . tanaka and his co-workers used a mix of shark egg powder, soya peptide, minerals, vitamins and krill paste  <cit>  to develop a successful feed for a. japonica. further research is, however, needed to develop suitable diets and rearing techniques for the production of larvae of other anguilla species and their hybrids.

european eel  females have a much slower, and widely-variable, response to hormonal stimulation  <cit>  when compared to females of other freshwater eel species . at the onset of the natural spawning migration, the gonadosomatic index  of a. anguilla females is close to 2%  and they are still in a previtellogenic state when they migrate to sea. however, females of a. australis have a higher gsi, of up to 4%  <cit> , indicating that they are sexually more advanced than a. anguilla at the same stage the same holds true for a. japonica, which has a gsi of up to 4% at the commencement of its spawning migration  <cit> . induction of vitellogenesis and final maturation in a. australis requires approximately six to eight weekly hormonal injections  while 9- <dig> injections  <cit> , or 6- <dig> weekly injections  <cit> , are required for a. japonica and up to 12- <dig> weekly injections for a. anguilla  <cit> .

there are several reasons for testing hybridization between european and new zealand short finned eels. there are large differences in silver eel maturation states between these species. in contrast to the stage reached by a. australis, silver eels of a. anguilla have not yet commenced vitellogenesis. shortening the artificial trajectory may overcome vitellogenic abnormalities, resulting in higher gamete quality and higher success rates of fertilization, hatching and larval development.

anguilla anguilla is listed by the iucn as critically endangered  <cit> , which raises some problems in association with the culture of this species. farming is reliant on the influx of wild glass eel, thereby pressurizing wild stocks. breeding for aquaculture is, nevertheless, supposed to take pressure off wild stocks. therefore, the hybridization of a. anguilla with a species such as a. australis, that has a short artificial trajectory, may be a suitable option for aquaculture. since maturation levels at silvering are very different in the parent species, it is quite possible that the maturation level of the hybrid at the silver stage would be far more advanced than that of the european silver eel. furthermore, since a. australis lives in the southern hemisphere, its migration is in january-june  <cit> , in contrast to a. anguilla, which migrates in october-november. to gain insights into the combination of the properties of a. australis and a. anguilla present in hybrids, it is useful to study eel reproduction and to compare the early ontogeny of these species including their hybrids.

a number of studies on hybridization of various eel species have been previously conducted: for example, female a. australis with male a. dieffenbachii  <cit> , and female a. japonica with male a. anguilla  <cit> . the existence of the artificial hybrids has not, however, been demonstrated by independent genetic methods. in contrast, genetic evidence for natural hybrids between the atlantic species a. rostrata and a. anguilla has been demonstrated  <cit> . since a. anguilla and a. australis are phylogenetically more closely related than some other hybrids , we hypothesized that hybridization between the former two species would be possible. in this paper we describe experiments on the hybridization of a. anguilla and a. australis and post-fertilization survival levels. investigations into the <dig> s rdna gene -- for the purpose of genetic validation -- are also described.

RESULTS
reproduction
after  <dig> weeks of injections with hcg, the first a. australis male started to spermiate and all males had spermiated within  <dig> weeks. after  <dig> weeks the injections were stopped. three of the  <dig> a. anguilla males produced sperm after  <dig> weekly injections and all males of a. anguilla had produced sperm after  <dig> weekly injections. before use, the males received a booster hcg injection to reactivate spermiation.

in most females, hormone treatment resulted in a rapid increase in body weight after 9- <dig> injections with salmon pituitary extract . ten of the  <dig> females  ovulated once and seven females ovulated twice during this study. the second ovulation was induced  <dig> weeks after the first ovulation by a single injection of  <dig> mg spe/kg dissolved in  <dig> ml  <dig> % saline, one priming injection of spe, and an injection with  <dig>  20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one  one day later. three females did not respond to the spe treatment and one female died after the dhp injection, just before ovulation. in total, three out of the ten batches of eggs produced larvae . the larvae of two of the three batches from a. australis x a. australis stayed alive for  <dig> dpf, and the larvae from one batch of the hybrid a. australis x a. anguilla stayed alive for  <dig> dpf. some of the eggs from one batch of a. australis were reared at 25°c, which resulted in larvae that survived until  <dig> dpf.

embryogenesis and early larval development of a. australis
after fertilization , developing eggs floated to a level just below the surface of the water, resulting in a clear separation from undeveloped eggs, which sank. cell divisions occurred every 30- <dig> minutes. the 4-cell and 8-cell states were observed at the  <dig>  hpf stage  and the  <dig> hpf stage , respectively. the 16-cell stage and 32-cell stage were observed at  <dig>  hpf  and  <dig> hpf , respectively. the morula stage  and the blastula stage  were observed at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, respectively. an embryonic shield started to form between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf , and the late gastrula stage was observed at about  <dig> hpf . somitogenesis started between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . the kuppfer's vesicle  was observed at about  <dig> hpf, and the first heartbeat occurred at about  <dig> hpf.

neutral buoyancy of the eggs was observed just before hatching. at approximately  <dig> hpf the embryos started to hatch and at that time had approximately  <dig> somites . after hatching  the larvae  were positioned upright in the water column, probably due to the position of the oil droplet. it appeared that the larvae were neutrally buoyant at  <dig> ppt. the larvae were immobile, except when disturbed by light or vibrations, which caused very fast and short horizontal movements. during sampling procedures  the larvae avoided suction, and swam in the opposite direction at speeds of up to several body lengths per second. sampling caused mechanical damage to larvae, followed by death within a short period. discoloration of the brain and neural tube was observed within a few seconds, followed by cellular breakdown of the larvae.

larvae elongated during development and lateral neuromast cells on the flank were observed at  <dig> hpf. head development showed remarkable changes over time, especially a decrease in volume of the 4th ventricle between  <dig> and  <dig>  dpf , the protrusion of the mouth and development of teeth between  <dig> and  <dig> dpf, and pigmentation of the eyes at  <dig> dpf . the angle of the head also increased in such a way that the mouth protruded anteriorly. at  <dig> dpf the larvae showed well developed teeth and a straightened head, indicating that they had reached the feeding stage. no visual differences in development between larvae from a. australis and the hybrid species were observed, except for the development of tail pigment cells, which were already present at about  <dig> dpf in the hybrid. in contrast, the pigmented cells appeared much later  in a. australis .

video recordings were made of several larvae, to observe the heart beat. the heart is bent in an s-shape, contracting regularly at a frequency of about  <dig> beats per minute in a  <dig> dpf larva . there were no significant differences between the heart beat rates of  <dig> dpf and  <dig> dpf larvae, suggesting that the rate is based on the innate rhythm of heart muscle tissue.

dna analysis
a species-specific nucleotide difference in the  <dig> s rdna genes of a. australis and a. anguilla  allowed us to provide genetic evidence that we had produced hybrid offspring from the two species. the pcr product amplified from the  <dig> s rdna gene is  <dig> bp long and has a single mismatch between a. anguilla and a. australis at position  <dig>  resulting in a bsshii restriction site, specific for the a. australis product . bsshii digestion of the pcr product from a. australis therefore results in  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp fragments, whereas the  <dig> bp pcr product from a. anguilla is not digested by bsshii. as the hybrid species must contain both the a. anguilla and the a. australis  <dig> s rdna genes, three fragments were expected. figure  <dig> clearly shows that the parental species a. anguilla and a. australis, as well as their hybrid, can be identified using the  <dig> s rdna gene.

discussion
in this study, we succeeded in breeding anguilla australis under artificial conditions and produced free swimming larvae of this species. in addition, hybrids of a. australis x a. anguilla were produced for the first time and genetic methods were used to confirm the existence of this hybrid. the hybrid larvae were kept alive for a maximum of  <dig> dpf and the larvae of a. australis for a maximum of  <dig> dpf.

larvae of a. japonica reach the feeding stage at approximately  <dig> days after hatching  <cit> . this development is strongly temperature dependent and for a. japonica the optimal temperature was shown to be about 25°c  <cit> . it was noted that hatching also occurred at about 25°c  <cit>  at the spawning site, suggesting that this may be the optimal temperature for early development. it was, however, noted that within a few days the larvae were distributed over an extremely large area at much lower temperatures  <cit> , suggesting that early larvae are able to develop at a wide range of temperatures.

in our study, the larvae raised at 25°c  were sufficiently developed to start feeding. in contrast, the  <dig> dpf larvae that were raised at 21°c had not yet reached the feeding stage and the head was still in a tilted position. the ten dpf larvae of a. australis -- collected by t. kurwie at  a prevailing temperature of 21°c -- were slightly more developed, although the 4th ventricle was still large and the eyes were not as fully pigmented, as in the  <dig> dpf larvae reared at 25°c . this clearly indicated that the main differences occur in the development of the head. compared to  <dig> dpf larvae reared at 25°c, the mouths of  <dig> dpf larvae reared at 21°c were not fully developed, the teeth were just starting to form, and the mouth angle was not fully protruded anteriorly. this shows that development is highly temperature dependent and that larval development cannot be indicated by age alone.

compared to other species, such as zebrafish  <cit>  and medaka  <cit> , development of the anguilla head seems relatively slow. on the other hand, the appearance of the lateral neuromast cells, which are part of the mechanosensory system, was already observed on the flanks at approximately  <dig> dpf. after hatching, the larvae were very sensitive to vibrations, indicating that mechanoreception is well developed at this stage. similar results were also reported for a. australis  <cit>  and a. japonica.  <cit> .

there were no visual differences in development and appearance between the two species other than the difference in timing of tail pigmentation, which occurred a few days earlier in the hybrid species than in a. australis. this seems to be a trait of the european eel, as a similar appearance of tail pigmentation was observed in a. anguilla  . the reason for tail pigmentation occurring at this early stage remains unknown.

in studies on the natural hybrid of a. anguilla with a. rostrata  <cit> , hybridization was validated by an independent method. this was not the case for recent artificial anguilla hybridizations performed by okamura et al.  <cit>  and lokman and young  <cit> . our results , based on the species-specific nucleotide difference in nuclear  <dig> s rdna, show that both a. anguilla and a. australis and their hybrid a. anguilla × a. australis can been identified according to the method of frankowski & bastrop  <cit> , in which the following fragments were produced: a single  <dig> s rdna fragment for a. anguilla, two fragments for a. australis, and three fragments for the hybrid species, indicating that two alleles from both parent species were present in the hybrid.

there are still problems with artificial reproduction and larval rearing of anguilla species, partly due to high individual variability in response to hormone treatments, and partly due to selecting the correct feed for larvae. tanaka et al.  <cit>  developed a reasonably successful feed for japanese eel larvae although almost all larvae died before, or shortly after, the first feeding stage, which may have been due to the unnatural feeding methods that were employed. possibly due to negative phototaxis, the larvae swim downwards towards the shark egg paste, where they encounter the food .

it is assumed that the natural food sources for leptocephalus larvae of anguilla spp. are the oikopleura larvacean shelters , which have been found in larval digestive tracts of several anguilloid species  <cit> . recent analysis of a. anguilla larval gut contents indicated that the diet of the smallest larvae consisted of a variety of plankton organisms, with hydrozoa and polycystinea species occurring most frequently  <cit> . so it seems that eel larvae may take a variety of available food from their immediate environment.

CONCLUSIONS
the applied reproduction method resulted in healthy embryos and larvae of new zealand short finned eels  as well as hybrids from male european eels  crossed with female new zealand short finned eels. the developmental stages of eel embryos and larvae are described by means of high resolution images. in this paper we described the first production of hybrid larvae from male a. anguilla and female a. australis and their survival for up to  <dig> days post fertilization . evidence for hybridization is based on a single nucleotide difference in the  <dig> s rdna gene of both species. this is the first time that an artificial anguilla hybrid has been validated by means of a genetic tool. future work with this hybrid may provide further understanding of the reproductive mechanisms that affect breeding of the european eel, which is now on the cites list of critically endangered species.
