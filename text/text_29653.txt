BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar pullorum  is the causative agent of pullorum disease , an acute systemic disease that results in high morbidity and mortality in young chicks and a loss of weight, decreased fertility and hatchability, lesions, diarrhea and abnormalities of the reproductive tract in infected adults, it can be transmitted vertically to chicks through eggs  <cit> . this disease remains a big threat of restricting the growth of the poultry industry in developing countries  <cit> . as a close relative of s. pullorum, salmonella enterica serovar gallinarum  causes fowl typhoid , a severe systemic disease with significant morbidity and mortality in poultry in many countries .

vaccination is an effective strategy for the control of salmonella infections, both humoral and cellular immunity are required for ideal salmonella vaccines  <cit> . live vaccines offer greater protection than killed vaccines because higher cellular immune response could be induced, it is important for clearance of salmonella infections  <cit> .

as an indispensable virulence determinant associated with the systemic infections, salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  can encode type iii secretion system  <dig> , which is induced after invasion, and the t3ss <dig> secreted effectors are essential for salmonella to survive and replicate inside various cell types  <cit> . there are some papers on the vaccine potential of s. enteritidis, s. typhimurium and s. typhi mutants with deletion of spi <dig> or other key genes located within the pathogenicity island display decreased virulence in poultry, pigs, cattle, mice, and humans . therefore, in order to determine whether the spi <dig> mutant strain of s. pullorum has the vaccine potential, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of s06004Δspi <dig> in susceptible hy-line white chickens. our results showed that intramuscular vaccination with s06004Δspi <dig> provides efficient protection against challenges with s. pullorum and s. gallinarum.

methods
experimental animals
the animal experiments were conducted with the approval of the animal care and ethics committee of yangzhou university. hy-line white chicken eggs were hatched and the chickens were detected for freedom from any clinical signs of enteric disease and negative for salmonella. two-day old chickens were used in this study and given antibiotic–free food and water throughout the experimental period.

bacterial strains
s. pullorum s <dig> , a nalidixic acid-resistant  clinical isolate obtained from chickens with pullorum disease in the jiangsu province of china in  <dig>  <cit> , and the virulent wild type s. gallinarum strain sg <dig> , supplied by dr. barrow  <cit> , were used as challenge strains. s06004Δspi <dig>  deleted mutant of s. pullorum s06004), constructed using the one-step inactivation method described by datsenko and wanner  <cit> , was used as the vaccine candidate for this study. bacterial strains were stored as frozen cultures in luria-bertani  broth with 20 % glycerol at −70 °c before use. lb broth, lb solid  and xlt <dig>  agar were used for culturing bacteria at 37 °c. the media were supplemented with nal  as required.

bacterial inoculation in chickens
one hundred 2-day old chickens were randomly assigned to  <dig> groups: vaccinated group  and control group . the vaccinated group was intramuscularly immunized with 2 × 107 cfu s06004Δspi <dig> in 100 μl phosphate buffered saline , while control group was unimmunized and only received equal amounts pbs.

changes of body weight and clinical symptoms after vaccination
body weights of these chickens were measured at  <dig>   <dig> and 19 days post vaccination , and they were monitored for 19 days for clinical signs of disease, which included anorexia, diarrhea and depression, etc.

bacterial persistence and clearance from internal organs
liver and spleen samples of five chickens from each group were aseptically collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpv for bacterial recovery. then they were weighed and suspended in 1 ml pbs and homogenized individually. homogenates  of different dilutions were inoculated on xlt <dig> agar  for enumeration and incubated for 20 h at 37 °c. the bacterial number in the sample was counted and expressed as log <dig> cfu/g, negative samples were indicated as 0 cfu/g.

immune responses induced by the vaccine strain
humoral immune responses were evaluated through determination of specific antibody igg levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , using heat-killed whole s. pullorum bacteria as coating antigen as previously described  <cit> . serum samples were collected from five chickens of each group at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpv, and diluted 1: <dig> to be used as the primary antibody. the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase -conjugated rabbit anti-chicken igg . the bound hrp activity was determined using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride , and the od <dig> was determined with an elisa reader after the reactions were stopped by 2 m h2so <dig> 

cellular immune responses were evaluated by the peripheral mononuclear cell proliferation assay as previously described  <cit> . soluble antigen was prepared from the wild type s. pullorum strain s <dig>  peripheral lymphocytes were separated from blood of five birds per group using the histopaque®- <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpv. after trypan blue dye exclusion testing, a viable mononuclear cell suspension  at 1 × 106 cfu/ml in rpmi- <dig> medium with 10 % fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine,  <dig> u/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin was incubated in triplicate in 96-well tissue culture plates with 50 μl of medium alone or medium containing 4 μg/ml of soluble antigen at 41 °c . the proliferation of stimulated lymphocytes was measured using adenosine triphosphate  bioluminescence with the vialight® plus kit . the blastogenic response against soluble antigen was expressed as the mean stimulation index  as previously described  <cit> .

evaluation of immune protection
protective efficacy of s06004Δspi <dig> against challenges with s. pullorum and s. gallinarum were assessed, based on survival rates and clinical symptoms . at  <dig> dpv, twenty chickens from vaccinated group were randomly divided into two groups of  <dig> animals , thirty chickens from control group were randomly divided into three groups of  <dig> animals . group a and b were challenged intramuscularly with 2 × 109 cfu s <dig> in 100 μl of pbs. groups c and d received equal amounts of sg <dig>  group e only received 100 μl pbs. the surviving birds were counted at 21 days post challenge, and clinical symptoms were recorded every day from 1– <dig> dpv.

statistical analysis
all data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean  values unless otherwise specified and analyzed with graphpad prism. p values less than  <dig>  were considered significant when using one-way analysis of variance .

discussion
in this work, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  deleted mutant of s. pullorum  to serve as a live vaccine against pd and ft in susceptible hy-line white chickens on the basis of changes of body weight and clinical symptoms, bacterial persistence and clearance, humoral and cellular immune responses, and protective efficiency.

in order to evaluate the effects of s06004Δspi <dig> on growth performance in chickens, we recorded the body weight increases and observed the clinical symptoms after intramuscular vaccination. our results showed that s06004Δspi <dig> has almost no side effects on growth performance in chickens. t3ss <dig> encoded by spi <dig> is essential for salmonella colonization and persistence in host. with the absence of a functional t3ss <dig>  salmonella is cleared more rapidly than the parental wild type strain from the host, and some studies have failed to isolate spi <dig> mutants from liver and spleen after oral inoculation  <cit> . here, our results showed that s06004Δspi <dig> can colonize and persist in liver and spleen of vaccinated chickens approximately 14 days, this may be related to the breed of chicken, the routes of vaccination and the dose of inoculation.

specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by the live attenuated vaccines of salmonella are crucial for the natural host  <cit> . to investigate the specific humoral immune responses imparted by the candidate, we examined the specific serum igg antibody level by indirect elisa, there was a strong specific serum igg level in vaccinated chickens, and the antibodies were detectable at  <dig> dpv. the vaccinated chickens showed significantly elevated igg levels compared to non-immunized chickens. s. enteritidis spi <dig> mutant can also induce significant increase of antibodies in chickens  <cit> . cellular immune responses play a central role in protection against salmonella challenge, because salmonella are facultative intracellular pathogens  <cit> . we further evaluated the cellular immune responses imparted by the candidate in chickens using the peripheral lymphocyte proliferation assay. in the present study, a significantly elevated cellular immune response was clearly observed in chickens immunized with s06004Δspi <dig>  but the significantly elevated si value was decreased at  <dig> dpv, it is related to the restricted colonization of bacteria in internal organs  <cit> . taken together, the specific humoral and cellular immune responses were clearly observed in the vaccinated chickens in this study.

several previous reports have shown that live attenuated salmonella vaccines can confer effective cross-protection to different pathogenic salmonella serovars  <cit> . here, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the candidate vaccine against challenge intramuscularly with s. pullorum and s. gallinarum, respectively, based on survival rates and clinical symptoms in hy-line white chickens. the survival rates were 90 % and 70 % following respective challenge with s. pullorum and s. gallinarum in vaccinated chickens; but in the control groups, the survival rates were 10 % and  <dig>  respectively. the light and temporary clinical symptoms of vaccinated chickens  had recovered by 3– <dig> days post-challenge. recently, our results also showed that s06004Δspi <dig> can be used as a live attenuated oral vaccine  <cit> . overall, these results showed that the candidate vaccine s06004Δspi <dig> can afford effective protection for acute systemic pd and ft infection.

CONCLUSIONS
our present work demonstrated that the vaccination of susceptible chickens with the candidate vaccine s06004Δspi <dig> conferred development of acquired immunity and efficient protection for the experimental systemic pd and ft infection. taken together, the spi <dig> mutant strain of s. pullorum has the potential of being used as a safe, novel, highly immunogenic vaccine against pd and ft.
