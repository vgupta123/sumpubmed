BACKGROUND
single-stranded dna-binding  proteins play an essential role in all in vivo processes involving ssdna. they interact with ssdna and rna, in an independent from sequence manner, preventing single-stranded nucleic acids from hybridization and degradation by nucleases  <cit> . ssb proteins play a central role in dna replication, repair and recombination  <cit> . they have been identified in all classes of organisms, performing similar functions but displaying little sequence similarity and very different ssdna binding properties. based on their oligomeric state, ssbs can be classified into four groups: monomeric, homodimeric, heterotrimeric and homotetrameric. a prominent feature of all ssbs is that the dna-binding domain is made up of a conserved motif, the ob  fold  <cit> . most of the bacterial ssbs exist as homotetramers. however, recent discoveries have shown that ssb proteins from the genera thermus and deinococcus possess a different architecture. ssb proteins in these bacteria are homodimeric, with each ssb monomer encoding two ob folds linked by a conserved spacer sequence  <cit> .

at present, with the exception of ssb from thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis  <cit> , all bacterial thermostable ssbs belong to the deinococcus-thermus phylum. they have been found in t. aquaticus  <cit> , t. thermophilus  <cit> , d. radiodurans  <cit> , d. geothermalis  <cit> , d. murrayi  <cit> , d. radiopugnans  <cit> , d. grandis and d. proteolyticus  <cit> . in addition, thermostable ssbs have also been found in thermophilic crenarchaea e. g. sulfolobus solfataricus  <cit> .

thermotoga maritima and t. neapolitana are strictly anaerobic heterotrophic eubacteria growing in marine environments at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 95°c. their dna base composition is  <dig> and  <dig> mol% guanine+cytosine, respectively  <cit> . among the eubacteria sequenced to date, t. maritima has the highest percentage  of genes that are highly similar to archeal genes. the observed conservation of gene order between t. maritima and archaea in many of the clustered regions suggests that lateral gene transfer may have occurred between thermophilic eubacteria and archaea  <cit> .

genomes of bacteria presented in the ncbi database have been screened in search for ssb gene homologs and their organization. in all the genomes, one or more genes coding for an ssb homolog were found  <cit> . on the basis of the ssb gene organization and the number of ssb paralogs, they classified bacteria in four different groups. t. maritima was classified as group ii, which contains bacteria with the ssb gene organization rpsf-ssb-rpsr.

in the present study the purification and characterization of two highly thermostable ssb proteins from t. maritima and t. neapolitana are described.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
the tmassb and tnessb proteins contained  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. they are the smallest prokaryotic ssb proteins so far identified . analysis of the primary structures by rps-blast  <cit>  revealed the presence of two distinctive regions: one putative ob-fold domain  and one c-terminal domain that contains five conserved deppf terminal amino acids, which are common in all known bacterial ssb proteins.

expression and purification of the recombinant tmassb and tnessb proteins
using the recombinant plasmid petssbtma or petssbtne, the expression of inducible proteins with the predicted size was excellent . both proteins were expressed in a soluble form in the cytosol. heat treatment resulted in considerably less contamination by the host proteins . the e. coli overexpression system used in this study produced about  <dig> and  <dig> mg of purified tmassb and tnessb protein, respectively, from  <dig> l of induced culture. the purity of the protein preparations was about 99% .

oligomerization status of the tmassb and tnessb proteins
analysis of the purified proteins by sds-page revealed a single major band with a molecular mass of about  <dig> kda for both proteins. in contrast, analysis by gel filtration chromatography revealed single peaks with a molecular mass of about  <dig>  kda for tmassb and  <dig>  kda for tnessb . this native molecular mass is approximately is  <dig>  times the molecular mass of the monomer for both proteins. this confirmed our prediction that in solution the tmassb and tnessb proteins exist as homotetramers. chemical cross-linking using glutaraldehyde confirmed the tetrameric state of the examined proteins .

dna-binding properties
when  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> were incubated with increasing amounts of tmassb or tnessb, a single band of reduced mobility was observed . most of those oligonucleotides were shifted after addition of  <dig> pmol of ssbs, and the mobility of the shifted band remained constant at the higher protein amounts . one band of identical mobility was observed for  <dig> at the low protein amounts, but a second band with a lower mobility appeared at the higher protein amounts ). these results suggest that tmassb and tnessb bind to  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> as one single homotetramer whereas two ssb homotetramers bind to  <dig>  similar binding patterns were observed with the tmassb and tnessb proteins in different salt concentrations .

the binding of the tmassb and tnessb proteins to the naturally occurring circular m <dig> ssdna  was also examined. in this experiment, a fixed amount of m <dig> ssdna was incubated with increasing amounts of ssb protein, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis . when increasing amounts of tmassb or tnessb protein were added to m <dig> ssdna, there was a progressive decrease in the mobility of the m <dig> ssdna.

to further explore the binding properties of the examined ssb proteins, we used fluorescence spectroscopy. all bacterium ssb proteins  studied so far have shown a dramatic decrease of tryptophan fluorescence when binding to ssdna. with an excitation wavelength of  <dig> nm, the emission spectrum of ssb proteins at 25°c had a maximum at  <dig> nm, which is consistent with tryptophan fluorescence. when adding a saturating quantity of ssdna, the intrinsic fluorescence at  <dig> nm was quenched by 95% for both the tmassb and the tnessb proteins. the estimated size of the ssdna binding site in the presence of  <dig> or  <dig> mm of nacl for the tmassb and the tnessb proteins was  <dig> ±  <dig> nt . none binding-mode transition was observed when changing the ionic strength from low  to high salt . in all cases, the cooperative affinity is estimated to be in the range of 107- <dig> m- <dig> 

thermostability
the half-lives of the ssdna-binding activities of tmassb and tnessb at 100°c, determined by gel mobility shift assays, were  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively. the thermostability for taqssb was  <dig> s at 95°c,  <dig> min at 90°c and  <dig> min at 85°c, as was also shown by dąbrowski et al.  <cit> .

when analyzed by differential scanning microcalorimetry  the thermal unfolding of tmassb, tnessb and taqssb was found to be an irreversible process, as seen in the rescan thermograms . the tnessb had the highest thermostability, with a melting temperature  of  <dig> °c, whereas tmassb had a tm of  <dig> °c . the melting temperature of taqssb was only  <dig> °c. this difference in tm confirmed the different thermostabilities of the proteins indicated by the observed half-lives of the ssdna binding activities. the thermograms of these ssb proteins did not show any characteristic signs of heavily aggregated proteins after heat denaturation. moreover, the results of the dsc and the half-lives of the ssdna binding activities suggest that the loss of binding activity of tmassb, tnessb and taqssb was connected with an irreversible thermal unfolding of the proteins.

in summary, the results showed that tmassb and tnessb are the most thermostable ssb proteins identified to date.

discussion
in this study, we have described the purification and characterization of ssb proteins from the thermophilic bacteria t. maritima and t. neapolitana. the results of the sequence analysis verified that a ssdna binding domain  in one monomer of both tmassb and tnessb proteins possess a canonical oligonucleotide binding fold , very similar to the observed in the structure of e. coli ssb  <cit> . both tmassb and tnessb form tetramers in solution as was shown by the gel filtration chromatography experiments. furthermore, they possess the shortest and most acidic c-terminal domains yet identified . the c-terminal domains contain 40% and  <dig> % negatively charged amino acids, respectively.

studies of other ssbs have often shown that the size of the binding site depends on the salt concentration. for example, for ecossb, at least two distinctly different dna-binding modes have been described  <cit> . in high salt concentrations,  <dig> nt bind per ecossb tetramer with almost 90% fluorescence quench, whereas in low salt concentrations  <dig> nt are sufficient to saturate the protein and quench its fluorescence by only 53%. this phenomenon has also been demonstrated for all known deinococcus-thermus ssbs  <cit> . however, such a distinctly different binding mode in high salt concentrations was not observed for the tmassb and tnessb proteins. the agarose gel mobility assays indicated that the binding site per tetramer is salt independent and is approximately  <dig> nucleotides based on fluorescence spectroscopy.

tmassb and tnessb proteins originating from the same genus, thermotoga, showed quite similar thermostability , i.e.  <dig> h and  <dig> h at 100°c, respectively. both proteins possessed a higher thermostability than even the most thermostable ttessb <dig>  which maintained full activity even after  <dig> h of incubation at 100°c  <cit> . additionally, the results of differential scanning microcalorimetry  also demonstrated a very high thermostability of both the ssb proteins. tnessb had a higher thermostability  than tmassb , whereas in comparison the melting temperature of taqssb was only  <dig> °c. therefore the thermostability of tmassb or tnessb was much higher in comparison to the thermostability of homodimeric ssbs from the thermophilic t. aquaticus, d. radiopugnans  <cit>  and d. murrayi  <cit> . in conclusion, the tmassb and tnessb are the most thermostable ssb protein identified up to date, offering an attractive alternative for taqssb and tthssb for applications in molecular biology and for analytical purposes especially for pcr and rt-pcr.

none of the two ssb proteins from thermotoga seemed to possess any special features relative to ecossb and compared with other known thermostable ssbs. neither their relative content of different amino acids nor the sequence comparisons could fully explain the cause of their exceptional thermostability. however, there were certain differences in the content of some amino acid residues. for example, the space between the highly hydrophobic core monomer and the highly acidic c-terminal fragment is very short in the tmassb and tnessb proteins in comparison with ecossb. this has also been demonstrated for ssbs from other highly thermophilic microorganisms like t. aquaticus and t. thermophilus  <cit> . this characteristically short and flexible c-terminus could protect the protein from thermal denaturation and make it more thermostable  <cit> .

based on the structure data the tmassb and ecossb proteins   <cit>  were analyzed to find more clues about the thermostability of ssbs from thermotoga. the homology modeling of the protein regions which lack electron density was carried out using modeller version  <dig>   <cit> . the modeled residues were  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> of tmassb and  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> of ecossb.

thermostability seems to be a property acquired by a protein through a combination of many small structural modifications that are achieved with the exchange of some amino acid residues for others and the modulation of the canonical forces  found in all proteins  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of thermostability are varied and depend on the specific protein  <cit> . the factors contributing to the protein stability include additional intermolecular interactions  and good general conformation structure   <cit> .

the structural similarity between the tmassb and ecossb proteins is quite high but there are many characteristic features in the structures of tmassb monomer and tetramer which account for the thermostability . the amount of salt bridges in thermophile proteins is higher than in the equivalent proteins of mesophiles. the number of salt bridges in the tetramer of tmassb is by over 50% higher than in the ecossb tetramer, whereas in the tmassb monomer it is even by 100% higher than in the ecossb. a few of the tmassb salt bridges are particularly important for the protein stability, e.g. one of them which stabilizes the c-terminus . it was showed that protein thermostability is correlated with the number of hydrogen bonds. the terminal β-strand  of tmassb is a single long strand stabilized by the hydrogen bonds with the residues of the preceding antiparallel β-strand , whereas in ecossb there are two shorter β-strands  divided by an additional loop that destabilizes this important region . these two intermolecular interactions, stabilize this essential protein region thus enhancing the anchoring the tmassb c-terminus. the amino acid sequence alignments of thermophilic and the mesophilic proteins have displayed some significant substitutions in thermophilic proteins such as gly to pro  <cit> . the ob-fold of tmassb protein has a threefold higher content of pro residues, whereas the content of gly residues is twice lower than that of ecossb . furthermore, there are three loops containing pro residues in the tmassb protein and there is only one in ecossb, which makes the former less susceptible to unfolding than the latter.

enhanced molecular compactness can enhance thermal stability. compactness can be achieved by e.g. optimized packing or the elimination of unnecessary cavities  <cit> . the packing density of both a monomer and tetramer is slightly higher in tmassb whereas the number of cavities is as much as 25% higher in ecossb.

in order to examine the geometrical fit between the surfaces a and b subunits and ab and cd pairs of ssb proteins  <cit> , the shape correlation statistic   <cit>  for tmassb and ecossb interfaces were calculated. this statistic provides a measure of packing of two protein surfaces. a value of sc =  <dig> indicates no geometrical fit, whereas a value of sc =  <dig> corresponds to two perfectly packed surfaces. calculation of the shape correlation statistic gave a value of sc =  <dig>  or  <dig>  for the interface of monomers a/b ecossb and tmassb, respectively. but surprisingly even more difference was for this parameter for interfaces between paired monomers ab/cd that equals  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ecossb and tmassb, respectively. these results indicate specifically that geometrical fit between tmassb protein surfaces is incomparably higher than ecossb.

in e. coli, the ssb base-stacking residues are trp- <dig>  trp- <dig>  phe- <dig>  and trp- <dig>  and in both tmassb and tnessb the related residues are phe- <dig>  phe- <dig> or phe- <dig>  phe- <dig> or phe- <dig> and trp- <dig> . highly conserved his- <dig>  gln- <dig> and gln- <dig>  important for homotetramerization of ecossb, were not found in the ssb proteins from thermotoga.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the purification and characterization of t. maritima and t. neapolitana ssbs, and how they relate to, and differ from, other members of this important class of proteins.

the tmassb and tnessb are the smallest known bacterial ssb proteins, their molecular mass deduced from the  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid sequences were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively.

the half-lives of tmassb and tnessb were extremely long:  <dig> h and  <dig> h at 100°c, respectively. when analyzed by differential scanning microcalorimetry  the melting temperature  was  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c for tmassb and tnessb, respectively. these results were very surprising in the context of half-life of ssb proteins from thermophilic thermus and deinococcus.

the results showed that tmassb and tnessb are the most thermostable ssb proteins identified to date and those thermostability of both ssb proteins offer an attractive tool for many applications in molecular techniques, especially for thermal nucleic acids amplification methods .
