BACKGROUND
metoclopramide  is a dopamine d2-receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic and gastroprokinetic agent in man  <cit>  as well as in dogs  <cit>  and cats  <cit> . the drug also has serotonergic effects  <cit>  and indirect parasympathomimetic activity  <cit> . metoclopramide has been used experimentally in pigeons as an antiemetic agent at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, body weight  <cit> . antidopaminergic drugs such as phenothiazine tranquilizers are known to induce a state of sedation in different animal species, including the chicken  <cit> . metoclopramide treatment has been reported to cause sedation in man  <cit> . such a sedative action of metoclopramide, though a side effect, has not been documented in the chicken as the drug is not used clinically in this species. in this communication, we present the central nervous system  depressant activity of metoclopramide in 7– <dig> days old broiler chicks. this age group of the chicken is suitable for examining sedative effects of cns depressants  <cit> .

RESULTS
injection of metoclopramide at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, subcutaneously  induced sedation in the chicks in a dose dependent manner. the chicks manifested within  <dig> – <dig> minutes of metoclopramide injection  signs of sedation characterized by drooping of the head and wings, closed eyelids, reduced motility and decreased distress calls. the duration of sedation ranged between  <dig>  to  <dig>  minutes and it was also dose dependent . metoclopramide at  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg induced, within  <dig>  and  <dig>  minutes, sleep  in the chicks for  <dig>  and  <dig>  minutes, respectively .

values are mean ± se of  <dig> chicks/group.

a control group of chicks was also treated with physiological saline solution .

the median effective doses  of metoclopramide for the induction of sedation and sleep in the chicks, as determined by the up-and-down method, were  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, s.c., respectively . metoclopramide at lower doses  also caused cns depression in chicks; the drug significantly decreased the open field activity of the chicks and significantly increased the durations of their tonic immobility . all chicks recovered smoothly from metoclopramide-induced cns depression and none of them suffered from adverse effects or died during the study.

discussion
sedation has been reported clinically in man treated with regular therapeutic  doses of metoclopramide  <cit> . this effect has not been quantitatively reported in animals, especially in avian species. in the present report, metoclopramide -induced cns depression in the chicks was concluded depending on the signs of sedation and sleep described in avian species  <cit> . the durations of sedation and sleep were also quantitatively reported . the ed50s of metoclopramide for the induction of sedation and sleep were calculated for the first time in chicks by the up-and down method. open-field activity and tonic immobility tests presented additional evidences for the cns depressant activity of metoclopramide in the chicks. little information are available on the pharmacological profile of metoclopramide in birds. the drug affects gastrointestinal motility in hispaniolan parrots  <cit>  and prevents reserpine-induced emesis in pigeons  <cit> . further, metoclopramide was found to increase gastrointestinal tract motility and inhibit plasma cholinesterase activity in chicks  <cit> . these effects are similar to those found in other animal species  <cit>  and further suggest that the sedative activity of metoclopramide in the chicken should be potentially expected.

metoclopramide depression is usually considered a side effect in man  <cit>  and possibly in animals. sedation could then be an additional pharmacological  effect of this drug to be expected in avian species. further exploration of the potential research and possibly therapeutic applications of this drug is needed as a sedative agent in avian species not intended for human consumption, as the drug is not approved for use in food producing animals. the chicks in the present study were successfully used as a model to show the cns depressant action of metoclopramide. chicks were reported to be a suitable animal model for examining the cns depressant action of drugs  <cit> . the sedative-hypnotic doses  of metoclopramide used in the present study are higher than the therapeutic ones used in dogs and cats  <cit> . however, the doses  of metoclopramide used in the present study are close to its antiemetic ones  used in pigeons treated with reserpine  <cit> . using the open-field activity test, metoclopramide-induced cns depression could be detected in the present study even at a dose as low as  <dig> mg/kg, s.c. . further, species differences in the magnitude of response to metoclopramide doses or its quality should be expected between mammals and birds or even among various avian species. such a species difference has been reported with sedatives like xylazine  <cit> .

overall, the findings of the present study indicate the sedative and hypnotic  effects of metoclopramide in chicks. these effects could be attributed to the antidopaminergic action of metoclopramide at the level of the cns  <cit> . centrally acting antidopaminergic drugs such as phenothiazine derivatives and butyrophenones are known to induce cns depression in different animals as well as in avian species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest that metoclopramide induces cns depression in chicks, and the drug could have potential research and clinical applications as a sedative-hypnotic agent in avian species not intended for human consumption.
