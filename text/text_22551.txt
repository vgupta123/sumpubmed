BACKGROUND
arap <dig> is a protein involved in phospatidylinositol  <dig> kinase  signaling pathways linked to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell spreading and the formation of lamellipodia  <cit> . it works as a gtp-ase activator protein  for the small g-proteins arf and rho  <cit> . previous studies have reported that arap <dig> binds ship <dig>  by forming a hetero-dimer via the sterile alpha motif domains  of both proteins  <cit> . the dissociation constant for this complex is about  <dig> nm as determined by previous isothermal titration calorimetry  studies  <cit> .

although the consequences of the interaction between the sam domains of arap <dig>  and ship <dig>  are not completely clear, it has been speculated that the heterotypic sam-sam association may be used by arap <dig> to link a negative regulator of pi3k signaling  to the effector complex  <cit> . in fact, while arap <dig> needs to bind phosphatidylinositolp <dig> p3) with one of its pleckstrin homology  domains to migrate to the plasma membrane and be activated  <cit> ; ship <dig>  by converting ptinsp <dig> to phosphatidylinositolp <dig> p2), works as an inhibitor of pi3k regulated pathways  <cit> .

here, we report on structural and binding studies of arap3-sam and ship2-sam. first, we determined the nmr solution structure of the sam domain of arap <dig> and characterized its interaction site for ship2-sam. furthermore, we also established the binding site of ship2-sam for arap3-sam. based on our observations, we speculate that the ship2-sam/arap3-sam complex may adopt the ml /eh  interaction model that is common to many sam/sam associations  <cit> . for example, we recently reported on a similar binding mode involving ship2-sam and the sam domain from the ephrin a <dig> receptor   <cit> , a sam-sam association that is important to regulate receptor endocytosis  <cit> . in agreement with these data, our nmr displacement experiments confirmed that arap3-sam and epha2-sam compete for a common binding site on the surface of ship2-sam.

our studies further clarify the structural features that are important for sam-sam interactions involving ship <dig> and give additional hints useful for identifying new molecules able to selectively inhibit sam-sam associations.

RESULTS
nmr solution structure of arap3-sam
the aggregation state of arap3-sam in solution was analyzed by means of analytical ultracentrifugation studies and backbone 15n r <dig> and r <dig> nuclear spin relaxation rates measurements.

arap3-sam has a rotational correlation time τc estimated by the r2/r <dig> average value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns at a protein concentration of  <dig> μm which increases only slightly to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns at the concentration of  <dig>  mm. the arap3-sam τc value is indeed similar to those reported for other sam domains, including ship <dig>  which only weakly self-associate  <cit> . on the contrary, the τc of ship2-sam bound to arap3-sam is  <dig> ±  <dig> ns, this higher value reflects the increase of the molecular weight caused by the sam-sam association and points towards the formation of a dimer  <cit> .

analytical ultracentrifugation measurements show that arap3-sam is a monomer in solution, in fact the experimentally measured molecular weight  is in perfect agreement with the expected molecular weight. moreover, no concentration dependent changes can be noticed in -hsqc spectra of arap3-sam recorded at protein concentrations of  <dig> μm or  <dig>  mm.

the solution structure of arap3-sam corresponds to a canonical sam domain fold . relevant structural parameters are reported in table  <dig>  distance and angle constraints are well satisfied in the ensemble of structures , and the conformers converge well  as demonstrated by the low root-mean-square deviation  values evaluated for the residues of the core domain .

ship2-sam/arap3-sam binding studies
the interaction between ship2-sam and arap3-sam was analyzed by means of chemical shift perturbation studies with 2d -hsqc experiments  <cit> . first, to map the ship2-sam binding interface for arap3-sam, 2d -hsqc spectra of a 15n uniformly labeled ship2-sam sample were acquired in presence and absence of unlabeled arap3-sam . normalized chemical shift variations were then evaluated with the equation Δδ = 1/ <dig>   <cit> . the largest Δδ  were mainly found in the middle part of the protein, including the α  <dig> and α  <dig> helices, the c-terminal portion of α  <dig> helix, and the close loop regions .

to identify the binding interface of arap3-sam for ship2-sam, titration experiments were carried out with 15n labeled arap3-sam and unlabeled ship2-sam . the residues of arap <dig> that were greatly perturbed by the interaction were assessed by analyzing the normalized chemical shift deviations . the largest variations were observed at the α  <dig> helix and the adjacent α1α <dig> and α 4α  <dig> loop regions .

the chemical shift mapping results were further supported by isothermal titration calorimetry studies with the ship2-peptide ac-eglvhngwddleflsditeedl-nh <dig>  that we have previously identified  <cit> . this peptide encompasses a region of ship2-sam  highly affected by chemical shifts variations upon binding to arap3-sam . itc measurements proved that the shiptide could interact with arap3-sam with a dissociation constant kd of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm, a single binding site model , binding enthalpy Δh = - <dig> ±  <dig> cal/mol and entropy change Δs =  <dig> ±  <dig> cal/ .

molecular modelling studies were also performed with the software haddock  <dig>   <cit>  to generate a model of the ship2-sam/arap3-sam complex . the best haddock solution  is shown in figure  <dig>  the dimer interface is mainly stabilized by electrostatic interactions in between acidic residues of ship2-sam and basic residues of arap3-sam . this model has been further confirmed by mutagenesis studies. to this end, an arap3-sam triple mutant was designed with the positively charged residues h <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> replaced by negatively charged asp residues. this mutant fails to bind ship2-sam with high affinity as evaluated by chemical shift perturbation studies .

nmr displacement experiment
to assess if arap3-sam could compete with epha2-sam for the same binding site of ship2-sam, we performed 2d -hsqc displacement experiments  <cit>  . we first recorded a spectrum of 15n labeled epha2-sam in its apo form. then, we added to this sample unlabeled ship2-sam in order to observe changes in the 2d -hsqc indicative of the formation of the ship2-sam/epha2-sam complex. the spectrum of unbound epha2-sam could be restored by addition of unlabeled arap3-sam  , thus demonstrating dissociation of the ship2-sam/epha2-sam complex due to the capture of ship2-sam by arap3-sam.

discussion
sam domains are small protein modules that act in several biological events and can form homotypic or heterotypic associations  <cit> . the lipid phosphatase ship <dig>  <cit>  contains a sam domain at its c-terminus. binding partners of this sam domain have been only recently reported and consist of the sam domain from the epha <dig> receptor  <cit>  and the sam domain from the pi3k effector protein arap <dig>  <cit> . the nmr solution structure of ship2-sam  has been recently determined in our laboratory  <cit> . we have also investigated the interaction between ship2-sam and epha2-sam by means of itc and nmr chemical shift perturbation studies  <cit> . itc data have shown that the sam domain of ship <dig> binds to the sam domain of the epha <dig> receptor with a dissociation constant kd =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and a 1: <dig> binding stoichoimetry  <cit> .

to gain additional insights into the structural determinants characteristic of the sam-sam interactions which involve ship <dig>  we have now performed similar structural and binding studies on the association of ship2-sam with arap3-sam. itc data by ramajjmaker et al.  <cit>  have already reported a kd value of about  <dig> nm and a single binding site model for this interaction.

the solution structure of arap3-sam consists of a small five helix bundle and represents a classical sam-domain fold . in fact, arap3-sam presents highest sequence homology with the sam domain of arap <dig>  as shown by a blastp  <cit>  search of the arap3-sam primary sequence versus the protein data bank  database  <cit> . sequence similarities with ship2-sam  and epha2-sam  are also relatively high  . previous studies have already reported that like ship2-sam, arap3-sam does not have a strong propensity to self-associate and prefers to be involved in heterotypic interactions  <cit> . our 15n r <dig> and r <dig> relaxation measurements together with analytical ultracentrifugation studies, further validate these findings.

chemical shift mapping studies indicate that the interaction surface of ship2-sam for arap3-sam is mainly made up of the central regions of the protein . this is the same area that we identified as responsible for the binding of ship2-sam to epha2-sam . the shiptide, a  <dig> residue long ship2-sam peptide, representing the minimal ship2-sam region capable of binding to epha2-sam, retains some ability to bind arap3-sam as shown by itc . in the case of arap3-sam/shiptide interaction, enthalpic contributions are responsible for ~44% of the free energy of binding  whereas for epha2-sam/shiptide interaction  <cit>  the enthalpy contributes only ~22% to the free energy of binding . thus, in the arap3-sam/shiptide complex hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions are more predominant.

in addition, nmr displacement experiments clearly show that arap3-sam and epha2-sam compete for the same binding site on the surface of ship2-sam .

the binding area of arap3-sam for ship2-sam is primarily made up of the c-terminal α  <dig> helix and adjacent loop regions . again, the location of this binding site closely resembles the interaction surface of epha2-sam for ship2-sam. from these binding data, we conclude that ship2-sam and arap3-sam most likely interact by using the mid-loop /end-helix  model that is common among sam-sam associations  <cit>  and where ship2-sam and arap3-sam are providing the mid-loop and end-helix interfaces respectively . the same interaction mode has been previously proposed by us for the interaction between ship2-sam and epha2-sam.

a model of the ship2-sam/arap3-sam complex was generated with the software haddock  <dig>   <cit>  by using chemical shift perturbation data . the best scoring solution represents well the ml/eh topology that is present in other experimental structure of sam-sam complexes  <cit> .

the binding site of ship2-sam for arap3-sam contains many negatively charged residues, while the eh interface of arap3-sam includes several positively charged amino acids. as a consequence, this model appears largely stabilized by electrostatic interactions . in fact, by destroying some of these interactions through simultaneous mutation of the positively charged arap3-sam residues h <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> to aspartic acids, the binding to ship2-sam is abolished or at least highly attenuated as shown by nmr binding data .

a very similar interaction model has been obtained by us for the ship2-sam/epha2-sam association, by means of docking procedures  <cit>  . the pattern of interactions at the dimer interface is analogous in the two complexes . it is worth noting that in the ship2-sam/epha2-sam model the epha2-sam residue y <dig> may form a stacking π-π interaction with the ship2-sam residue f <dig> that can be replaced by the cation-π interaction between the arap3-sam residue r <dig> and f <dig> of ship <dig> in the complex ship2-sam/arap3-sam. furthermore, in the ship2-sam/arap3-sam complex h <dig> of arap3-sam could provide an additional electrostatic interaction with d <dig> of ship2-sam that is not permitted in the ship2-sam/epha2-sam dimer . these observations may reflect the relatively stronger binding observed between arap3-sam and ship2-sam  compared to the binding of epha2-sam to ship2-sam  as well as the better haddock score for the arap3-sam/ship2-sam model .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the 3d solution structure of arap3-sam and reported on binding studies with ship2-sam. our work leads us to hypothesize that the interaction mode of these two sam domains is best described by the canonical mid-loop/end-helix model  <cit>  in which ship2-sam and arap3-sam are providing the mid-loop and end-helix interfaces respectively. a similar model has been recently suggested by us for the interaction in between ship2-sam and epha2-sam  <cit> . our studies also show that arap3-sam competes with epha2-sam for binding to ship2-sam. together with binding studies on the shiptide peptide, our results provide a framework onto which one could envision designing novel molecular probes able to selectively interfere with either the ship2-sam/epha2-sam or with the ship2-sam/arap3-sam associations.
