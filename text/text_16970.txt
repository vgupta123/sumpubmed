BACKGROUND
members of the transforming growth factor β  superfamily play central roles in controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis  <cit> . these cytokines can be divided into three subgroups: tgf-β, the activins/inhibins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins , of which the latter constitute the largest family. bmps are 30– <dig> kda hetero- or homodimeric proteins originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated an essential role of these proteins during embryogenesis, and more recently, also in adult tissues  <cit> . tgf-β has been intensively studied in normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and is one of the most potent endogenous negative regulators known to date.  <cit> . in contrast, the effect of bmps in the immune system has not been widely investigated. in that respect, bmp-  <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells  <cit>  and early t cell development  <cit> . bmp- <dig> has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone-area-forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells  <cit> . furthermore, bmp- <dig>  - <dig>   <dig> and - <dig> had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells  <cit> . in addition, by gene expression profiling, bmp- <dig> significantly increased the predictive value for a multi-gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large b cell lymphomas   <cit> .

bmp- <dig>  like the other bmp members, signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of bmp type i  and type ii serine-threonine kinase receptors, which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating smad proteins. bmp- <dig> can signal through the ligation of the type i receptors act-ria, bmp-ria, and bmp-rib and the type ii receptors bmp-rii, act-riia and act-riib, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor smads . the r- smads then form complexes with the co-smad  and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation  <cit> .

given the reported role of bmp- <dig> in b-cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells, we wanted to explore its potential role in normal human b cells. we studied the effects of bmp- <dig> on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated b cells. furthermore, the expression of bmp receptors and bmp- <dig> induced activation of the smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes id1–id <dig>  were resolved. finally, we investigated whether b cells also were capable of producing bmp- <dig> 

RESULTS
bmp- <dig> inhibits anti-igm induced proliferation of human b cells
the effects of bmp- <dig> on normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells prompted us to investigate the effects of bmp- <dig> on normal human b cells. all experiments in this study were performed under serum-free conditions as fcs has been shown to interfere with bmp-signalling  <cit> . to study the effect of bmp- <dig> on proliferation, b-cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated with anti-igm and/or cd40l in the presence or absence of bmp- <dig> for three days. we found that bmp- <dig> led to a 35% mean reduction of anti-igm- induced dna synthesis . similar results were obtained for b cells treated with anti-igm and cd40l . the bmp-6-induced inhibition of proliferation was dose-dependent in both peripheral b cells  and the burkitt lymphoma cell line ramos . the bmp- <dig> effects could be reversed by addition of the extracellular inhibitor noggin . similarly, a combination of the soluble bmp receptors bmp-rib-fc and bmp-rii-fc also neutralized the effects of bmp- <dig> . next, we wanted to test whether bmp- <dig> had different effect on naïve and memory b cells. naïve  and memory  b cells were isolated from peripheral blood by cell sorting of immunobead-isolated cd19+ b cells  <cit> , and tested for their capacity to proliferate in the presence of bmp- <dig>  however, bmp- <dig> inhibited anti-igm induced dna synthesis in the two subpopulations to a similar extent, with a mean reduction of dna-synthesis of 45%  for naïve b cells and 48%  for memory b cells .

bmp- <dig> induces cell death in human memory b cells and ramos cells
next, we wanted to establish whether bmp- <dig> also could affect the viability of normal b cells. cell viability was determined by propidium iodide  staining after culture with or without bmp- <dig> for  <dig> hours. interestingly, bmp- <dig> showed a small, but reproducible mean increase of cell death from  <dig> to 23%  in anti-igm stimulated cd27+ memory b cells. furthermore, ramos cells showed a mean increase in cell death from  <dig> to 50%  after bmp- <dig> treatment. in contrast, cell death of total cd19+ cells  or cd27-igg- naïve b cells was not significantly affected .

human b cells express bmp- <dig> receptors
detailed knowledge regarding expression of different bmp receptors in b cells is currently not available. to further elucidate the role of bmps in human b cells, we performed western blot analysis for type i and type ii bmp receptors. this analysis revealed that the type i receptors act-ria, bmp-rib and the type ii receptors bmp-rii and act-riib are expressed on resting human b-cells . ramos cells expressed the type i receptors act-ria, weakly bmp-rib and the type ii receptor bmp-rii, but more weakly than normal b cells . hl <dig> cells were used for comparison and weakly expressed act-ria and bmp-rii.

taken together, these data show that normal human b cells and ramos cells express a set of bmp receptors, previously shown to bind bmp- <dig>  <cit> .

bmp- <dig> induces phosphorylation of smad1/5/8
upon ligand binding, the type ii receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type i receptor. type i receptors can signal via several pathways. we examined the effect of bmp- <dig> on smad phosphorylation, as the activation of smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for bmps  <cit> . b cells were cultured in serum-free media over night and then treated with bmp- <dig> for various time points. total protein lysates were prepared, and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of smad1/5/ <dig> were determined by western blot analysis. interestingly, treatment with  <dig> ng/ml bmp- <dig> induced phosphorylation of smad. the bmp- <dig> induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested , and remained high for at least  <dig> hours . a similar phosphorylation was observed in ramos cells, but not in hl <dig> cells . furthermore, we also tested whether other known downstream signalling pathways of bmp- <dig> could be triggered by bmp- <dig> in human b cells. however, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-stat <dig> or phospho-p <dig> upon bmp- <dig> treatment of b cells .

bmp- <dig> induces upregulation of id1
next, we wanted to explore whether the bmp- <dig> induced phosphorylation of smad 1/5/ <dig> also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes. in this regard, the inhibitors of dna binding proteins  are considered to be some of the major target genes for smad-signalling  <cit> . thus, b cells were pre-incubated over night in x-vivo  <dig>  and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of bmp- <dig> for various time points before preparation of total rna. the amount of id1–id <dig> mrna was quantified by real-time rt-pcr. interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of id <dig> mrna in bmp-6-treated b cells . the up-regulation of id <dig> mrna was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of bmp- <dig> and returned to baseline after  <dig> hours. in contrast, no significant changes were observed for id <dig> and id <dig> mrna, whereas id4-transcripts were not detectable .

western blot analysis revealed that the bmp-6-induced upregulation of id <dig> mrna also was correlated with upregulation of id <dig> protein as well. the increase in id <dig> protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until  <dig> hours after bmp- <dig> addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t <dig>  . in line with the mrna data, no consistent change in the amounts of id <dig> and id <dig> protein could be observed . we were able to block the id <dig> specific band with a blocking peptide . taken together, these data suggest that id <dig> could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of bmp- <dig> in human b cells, whereas id <dig> and id <dig> not seem to be involved.

bmp- <dig> production in b cells
the fact that bmp- <dig> has been reported to act as an autocrine stimulator in chondrocytes  <cit>  and ovarium  <cit> , prompted us to investigate whether normal human b cells could produce bmp- <dig> upon stimulation. ramos cells, which have been described to express bmp- <dig> mrna endogenously  <cit> , and the t cell line jurkat, served as positive and negative controls, respectively. endogenous bmp- <dig> mrna levels in normal b cells were quantified by real-time rt-pcr after stimulation with anti-igm for different time points. interestingly, the up-regulation of bmp- <dig> mrna was characteristic of an early-to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti-igm. the level of bmp- <dig> mrna was back to baseline after  <dig> hours upon stimulation . furthermore, both fcs and human ab-serum induced significant upregulation of bmp- <dig> mrna . interestingly, in a separate study we have found that normal human t cells do not express bmp- <dig> mrna after activation . next, we wanted to detect bmp- <dig> protein in normal b-cells and tested various commercially available antibodies. however, in our hands these anti-bmp- <dig> antibodies did only recognize the recombinant bmp- <dig> protein and not the native protein.

discussion
recent studies have demonstrated an important role for bmp superfamily members in hematopoietic stem cells, early thymocytes  <cit>  and b-cell malignancies  <cit> , but a role for bmps in normal human b cells has previously not been reported. the present study demonstrated a significant antiproliferative effect of bmp- <dig> in peripheral blood cd19+ b cells. additionally, bmp- <dig> induced cell death in cd27+ memory b cells as well as in a burkitt lymphoma cell line . importantly, bmp- <dig> induced a rapid and marked increase in smad-1/5/ <dig> phosphorylation. furthermore, the bmp- <dig> induced smad phosphorylation was followed by a selective upregulation of id <dig> mrna and subsequent id <dig> protein.

in the present study, the demonstrated antiproliferative effect of bmp- <dig> in anti-igm treated b cells was significant and dose-dependent. importantly, the anti-proliferative effect of bmp- <dig> could be completely neutralized by the use of a natural inhibitor, noggin. this is in line with others, showing that noggin can function as a bmp- <dig> antagonist  <cit> . in addition, the combination of soluble bmp-rib-fc and bmp-rii-fc fusion proteins also neutralized the anti-proliferative effect of bmp- <dig> in human b cells. interestingly, as for other tgf family members, bifunctional effects have also been demonstrated for bmps. whereas several of the bmps have been shown to promote proliferation in various cell types including condrocytes  <cit> , liver  <cit>  and granulosa cells  <cit> , antiproliferative effects and induction of apoptosis has been reported for b and t lineage cells. similar effects as demonstrated for bmp- <dig> on human b cells in the present study, were demonstrated for bmp- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and - <dig> in human myeloma cells  <cit> . other members of the bmp-family have also been reported to induce apoptosis, including in mouse b lineage cells  <cit> . additionally, bmp- <dig> inhibits thymocyte proliferation  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that the role of bmps in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis is highly cell type dependent.

to examine how bmp- <dig> exerts its functional effects in b cells, we analysed bmp receptor expression by western blot analysis. human peripheral b cells were found to express the bmp type i receptors act-ria and bmp-rib, and the type ii-receptors bmp-rii and act-riib, which signal after binding of several bmps, including bmp- <dig>  <cit> . to further explore bmp- <dig> induced signalling, activation of several pathways is possible. the major signalling pathway known to date, is activation of r-smads  <cit> . in that respect, bmps have been shown to exert antiproliferative effects in b lineage cells via phosphorylation of r-smad  <cit> . furthermore, bmp- <dig> has been shown to induce activation of stat <dig> in myeloma cells  <cit> . however, phosphorylation of r-smad was not investigated in that study. bmp- <dig> has also been shown to induce phosphorylation of p <dig>  <cit> . thus, phosphorylation of p <dig>  stat <dig> and smad1/5/ <dig> represent important bmp-signalling pathways that mediated the effects of bmps and even cross-talk between these pathways has been reported  <cit> . in the present study, we were not able to detect bmp-6-induced changes in the phosphorylation status of stat <dig> or p <dig> in human peripheral b cells. instead, a rapid and marked phosphorylation of smad1/5/ <dig> was revealed. in a parallel study, we have found that other bmps also induced phosphorylation of smad1/5/ <dig> in peripheral b cells . we are currently pursuing microarray studies to identify the signalling pathways and target genes that are differently regulated by the various bmps in human b cells.

upregulation of id <dig> via smad1/5/ <dig> phosphorylation is a known mechanism for bmp- <dig> signalling in other cell systems  <cit>  and regulation of id-proteins is thought to be an important mechanism for smad-signalling  <cit> . in the present study, real-time rt-pcr experiments revealed a specific four-fold upregulation for id <dig> in bmp-6-treated b cells, while the amount of id2–id <dig> remained unchanged. in agreement with this, western blot analysis demonstrated an upregulation of id <dig> protein, while the amount of id <dig> and id <dig> protein levels remained unchanged. previously, id <dig> has been considered not to be expressed in later developmental stages than pro-b cells  <cit> , and its constitutive expression has been reported to impair mouse b cell development  <cit> . therefore, our demonstration of the time-dependent upregulation of id <dig> mrna and protein in mature normal human b cells is of particular interest. in that respect, it is noteworthy that tgf-β signalling in early and mature b cells induces both id <dig> and id <dig> expression  <cit> , but not id <dig> . interestingly, these results show that various members of the tgf-β family regulate id proteins differently. id <dig> and id <dig> are considered to be the id proteins mainly expressed in mature b cells  <cit> . the present study also found id <dig> and id <dig> protein in b cells to be more highly expressed than id <dig> in resting b cells. however, bmp- <dig> did not induce significant changes in the protein expression of id <dig> and id <dig>  it is believed that id proteins block differentiation and promote proliferation in various cell types  <cit> . id proteins act as dominant-negative inhibitors of e-proteins and pax <dig> function by forming dimers with these proteins, making them unable to bind dna. it has been proposed that the balance among e-proteins, pax <dig> and id proteins might have an important role in activated b cells  <cit> . in that respect, e-proteins have been implicated in both the promotion and inhibition of cell survival and growth at different points in lymphocyte development  <cit> . the antiproliferative and death inducing effect of bmp- <dig> in b cells with concomitant upregulation of id <dig> protein is therefore in line with the view that id proteins are required for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in b-lymphocyte progenitors by tgf-β  <cit> .

furthermore, id proteins are known as important parts of signalling pathways involved in development, cell cycle and tumorigenesis  <cit> . it is well established that various members of the id family are overexpressed in a range of human tumours and generally, id <dig> appears to be the family member most widely overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies  <cit> , including multiple myeloma  <cit> . additionally, our findings that bmp- <dig> activates intracellular signalling pathways in human b cells might be of potential pathophysiological significance in lymphoma and inflammation. high bmp- <dig> mrna expression in dlbcl has been shown to correlate to unfavourable outcome  <cit> . in this respect, it is of interest that targeted expression of id <dig> to b-lymphocytes resulted in aberrant b cell development, massive apoptosis, and subsequent development of b cell lymphomas  <cit> . moreover, bmp- <dig> has been suggested to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis   <cit>  and elevated levels of id <dig> and id <dig> have been found in the synovia of ra-patients  <cit> . altogether, these results point to an important role for id proteins in the regulation of normal b cell homeostasis and in diseases, where b cells are involved. it will therefore be important to further elucidate the role of id- <dig> in human b cells by selective over expression or inhibition of id- <dig> gene expression.

given the role of bmp- <dig> in mature human b cells demonstrated here, identification of bmp- <dig> producing cells in vivo with possibility of interaction with naïve and memory b cells might contribute to the understanding of mature b cell biology. high bmp- <dig> mrna expression in dlbcl has been detected by gene expression profiling  <cit> . furthermore, production of bmp- <dig> transcripts in normal activated b cells was detected in the same study. of note, an autocrine bmp- <dig> loop has been reported by others in chondrocytes and in the ovarium  <cit> . therefore, we wanted to explore the possibility for an autocrine bmp- <dig> loop in human b cells. we analysed the expression bmp- <dig> mrna in peripheral blood b cells by real-time pcr, and report here the upregulation of endogenous bmp- <dig> transcripts after stimulation with fcs, human ab-serum and, most importantly, anti-igm. however, our attempts to study bmp- <dig> protein levels were unsuccessful due to problems with unspecific binding of the anti-bmp- <dig> antibodies tested, and lack of specific staining in control cells known to express bmp- <dig> mrna. in contrast, the recombinant protein was readily detected. in that respect, few investigators have detected bmp- <dig> protein in humans, especially in non-pathogenic tissue. the possibility of bmp- <dig> production in human b-cells is in line with a recent work that reported the production of bmp- <dig> in mouse b cells, infiltrating the bone marrow of mice with inflammatory arthritis  <cit> . in this study, a role for bmps in the inflammatoric process of arthritis was suggested. the upregulation of the bmp-6-transcripts after igm-crosslinking is of pathophysiologic interest  <cit> . a loss of tgf-β-responsiveness has been suggested to be a critical contribution to malignant transformation  <cit>  and similar oncogenic mechanisms have been postulated for bmps. lines of evidence suggest  <cit>  that at early stages of carcinogenesis, bmp- <dig> is not a tumour promoter, but suppresses benign and malignant tumour outgrowth. these findings are in good agreement with previous findings for other tgf-β family members, including tgf-β <dig> and bmp- <dig>  <cit> , indicating that cellular context of the bmp target cell might define the various observed effects. in contrast to the upregulation of bmp- <dig> transcript in b cells, we were not able to detect bmp- <dig> transcripts in human peripheral blood cd4+ or cd8+ t cells , consistent with the findings in t cell lines  <cit>  and t cells in mice  <cit> . other potential bmp- <dig> sources for mature b cells in vivo might be other cells of the immune system or tissue with contact to the hematopoietic system. one well recognized source for bmp- <dig> production is the human bone and bone marrow stroma  <cit> . furthermore, it is noteworthy that human umbilical vein endothelial cells  highly express bmp- <dig> mrna  <cit> , and vascular endothelium has been reported to produce bmp- <dig>  <cit> . these studies might imply a role for bmp- <dig> in transendothelial migration of b cells. bmp- <dig> mrna has been demonstrated in murine macrophage cell lines, but not in humans  <cit> . in accordance with these findings, other human cell lines of neutrophil and monocytic origin have been described to be negative for the bmp- <dig> transcript  <cit> . to our knowledge, there is currently no report about bmp- <dig> production of human dendritic cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results show that bmp- <dig> induces activation of intracellular smad signalling in mature human b-cells with consecutive production of id <dig> protein. furthermore, we report that bmp- <dig> has an antiproliferative effect in b cells stimulated with anti-igm alone or the combined action of anti-igm and cd40l. additionally, bmp- <dig> induces cell death in activated memory b cells and ramos cells. taken together, these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of bmp- <dig> signalling in normal b cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like b cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.
