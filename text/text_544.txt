BACKGROUND
budding yeast has one class ii myosin, myo <dig>  <cit> , with the classic myosin superfamily domain organisation consisting of a conserved motor domain, a neck domain of  <dig> iq motifs that binds the light chains mlc <dig> and mlc <dig>  <cit>  and a tail region with a predicted coiled coil, as seen for all class ii myosins so far studied. while the motor domain is responsible for the actin binding and atp hydrolysis that allows the myosin to move along actin filaments, the class ii myosin tails are responsible for how the motor function is used: the tails determine dimerisation, filament formation and localisation  <cit> .

there are two potential ways in which class ii myosins may localise to the site of cell division: 1) by binding to other proteins, as for example in fission yeast,  where mid <dig> is shown to temporally regulate the localisation of the major class ii myosin, myo <dig>   <cit> ; 2) by filament formation, as shown in d. discoideum where filament formation is required for myosin ii to localise to the cleavage furrow  <cit> . in non-muscle, smooth muscle and d. discoideum myosin ii, it has also been shown that one or more small regions in the tail are responsible for filament formation  <cit> . filament formation is thought to occur by the interaction of the charged residues  between two dimers. with the exception of fission yeast myp <dig>  which has a discontinuous coiled coil and forms a monomer  <cit> , the class ii myosins studied to date all form dimers. in d. discoideum, filament formation also depends on dephosphorylation of  <dig> serine residues  <cit> . it was also shown that dephosphorylation of myo <dig> in fission yeast is necessary for localisation  <cit> . it should be noted that higher eukaryotic class ii myosins are also regulated by phosphorylation of their light chains but this has not been demonstrated in d. discoideum or fission yeast  <cit> .

very little is known about the structure of budding yeast myo <dig> and how it is recruited to the site of cell division. unlike higher eukaryotic class ii myosins, myo <dig> is not predicted to consist of a continuous coiled coil as shown in the pair coil  <cit>  prediction plot in fig.  <dig>  this raises the question as to what kind of structure the myo <dig> tail forms and how this might affect its cellular function and the structure of the contractile ring . in order to determine if coiled coil formation is required for the localization of budding yeast myosin ii, we set out to map the minimum domain in the tail region that is necessary and sufficient for myo <dig> localisation. we use hydrodynamic measurements to assess its oligomeric nature and use frap analysis to compare the in vivo dynamics of the minimum localisation domain with the full length molecule. we also demonstrate that a region of low coiled coil forming potential that we have named the hinge region is important in the localisation and function of myo <dig> 

RESULTS
a small region in the tail is sufficient for myo <dig> localisation
in order to determine whether there is a discrete region of myo <dig> necessary and sufficient for localisation, deletion constructs were created and transformed into wild type and myoiΔ strains. the number of rings at the bud neck as a percentage of the total number of bud necks was calculated for each construct in both wild-type and Δmyo <dig> strains and the results are shown in fig  <dig>  with fluorescent microscopy images of gfp labelled myo <dig> and mld shown below the localisation percentages. these results show that the minimum localisation domain  consists of residues 1044– <dig>  the coiled coil prediction plot shows that the mld  encompasses the region of low coiled coil forming probability, which includes  <dig> proline residues. deletion of any additional parts of the mld led to a lower percentage of localisation as compared to the full length mld .

the minimum localisation domain  of myo <dig> forms an oligomer
since dimerisation and subsequently filament formation in many class ii myosins is required for localisation we wanted to determine if the mld forms oligomers. to this end, gst-mld was purified after expression in e. coli. after removal of the gst tag, the mld was applied to a superose  <dig> gel filtration column. the mld eluted at  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  minutes  and the stokes radius was obtained from a calibration curve of standards with known stokes radii as shown in fig. 3a; this resulted in a stokes radius of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  nm for the mld . the void volume for the column was obtained using dextran blue , which gave an elution time of  <dig>  minutes. thyroglobulin, which has a molecular weight of  <dig> kda and an elution time of  <dig>  minutes, ran close to the mld, showing that the calibration curve was well within the upper resolution limit of the column. purified mld was also applied to a preformed 6– <dig> % sucrose density gradient and was found in fraction  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  . a sedimentation coefficient obtained from a calibration curve of known sedimentation coefficients, as shown in fig. 3b, was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  s . neither gel filtration nor sucrose density gradient centrifugation can be used in isolation to obtain the molecular weight of the mld as the presumed elongated nature of the protein will result in a larger apparent stokes radius and a smaller apparent sedimentation coefficient as compared with a globular protein. this makes it difficult to determine the true molecular weight and thus the oligomeric nature of the mld. however, combining the stokes radius and the sedimentation coefficient in equation  <dig>  allowed us to determine an experimental molecular weight of  <dig> kda for the mld. when this value is divided by the calculated molecular weight for a monomer , the oligomer is tentatively assigned to be a trimer .

we were concerned that the experimental values obtained were a product of expressing and purifying the mld from e. coli. in order to be sure that our expressed protein was behaving in the same way as it would in yeast, the mld with a c-terminal  <dig> tag was transformed into yeast . yeast extracts were prepared by grinding frozen cells under liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar; the powder was resuspended in a small volume of buffer and centrifuged to remove cellular debris and unlysed cells.  <dig> μl of the supernatant was applied to the superose  <dig> gel filtration column. fractions were collected and western blots were carried out after trichloroacetic acid  precipitation to determine the elution position of mld- <dig>  as shown in fig. 3c and 3d, mld- <dig> eluted in the same fractions  as the expressed bacterial protein  indicating that they are hydrodynamically similar and thus that the trimer value assigned to mld was not an artefact of expression in e. coli.

removing the mld hinge region affects the function of myo1
we observed that deletion of the mld from myo <dig> resulted in complete loss of localisation  but that deletion of the hinge region  within the mld only lowered the efficiency of localisation to the bud neck to  <dig> –  <dig> % of the full length molecule  showing that the hinge region contributes to localisation but its loss does not abolish localisation. since several other class ii myosins contain kinks  in their tail that are important for function, we wanted to examine the effect of removing the hinge region from myo <dig> on cr contraction. a plasmid encoding myo1Δhinge  under the control of the myo <dig> promoter was transformed into the heterozygous diploid myo1Δ strain , and haploid strains straining expressing myo1Δhinge as the sole myo <dig> were obtained by sporulation and tetrad dissection.

we monitored contraction of the cr in wild-type and myo1Δhinge strains. cells were grown at the room temperature and arrested for  <dig> hrs with nocodazole. the cells were then released from arrest and contraction was monitored using time-lapse confocal microscopy with images taken every  <dig> s. fig.  <dig> shows montages  and kymographs  of the wild-type and myo1Δhinge ring as it goes through cytokinesis. interestingly, myo1Δhinge rings were unable to undergo contraction: the rings remained steadily at the bud neck until late in the cell cycle before gradually disappearing without reduction in diameter . this was in contrast to the cr in wild-type cells, which contracted to a point before disappearing .

fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  studies of wild-type and mutant myo1-gfp rings
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  enables one to examine the dynamics of a fluorescently labelled molecular structure: fast recovery of the fluorescent signal indicates that there is a free pool of molecules that interchange rapidly with the molecules in the bleached area. we used frap to compare the in vivo dynamics of gfp-tagged full length myo <dig>  mld and myo1Δhinge . images were collected at  <dig> or  <dig> s intervals and analysed for fluorescence recovery. table  <dig> shows the average percentage recovery and half time values. myo1Δhinge appeared to be the most dynamic, recovering the greatest proportion of the bleached fluorescence and having the smallest recovery half time. this suggests that the contraction defect of the myo1Δhinge could be due to a structural abnormality causing the mutant myo1Δhinge molecules to be less well anchored within the cr. the mld on the other hand appears to have a dynamic behaviour in between that of the full length molecule and myo1Δhinge  suggesting that the mld is sufficient for stable association with the cr, but that other regions of myo <dig> further stabilise the association.

discussion
in the experiments described above, we have characterized the minimum domain required for targeting myosin-ii to the site of cell division in budding yeast. we show that this domain can oligomerise and form what appears to be trimers in solution and exhibits dynamics intermediate to those of the full length myo <dig> molecule and myo <dig> missing the region of low coiled coil forming probability .

how feasible is it that myo <dig> might form a trimer? coiled coils are a ubiquitous protein motif with the ability to form many different kinds of structures depending on the knobs-into-holes packing of the residues in the coiled coil and how this is disrupted by the distribution of breaks and stutters within the heptad repeat sequence  <cit> . the formation of triple stranded coiled coils is not unusual  <cit> ; for example the influenza hemagglutinin protein  <cit>  and the bacteriophage t <dig> whisker proteins  <cit>  form parallel triple stranded coiled coils while the bar domain of proteins such as amphiphysin consists of an antiparallel triple stranded coiled coil that dimerises  <cit> . additionally trimers may be observed experimentally even when they have a dimeric coiled coil prediction  <cit> . kammerer et al  <cit>  provide evidence for a  <dig> residue trimerisation motif  in short coiled coils. interestingly two such motifs are present in the myo <dig> tail , one at the c-terminal end of the hinge region and one just beyond the c-terminal end of the mld. furthermore, many of the a and d residues of the heptad repeat in the myo <dig> tail as predicted by either coils  <cit>  or paircoil  <cit>  are asparginine, threonine and serine residues which can be prevalent in trimeric coiled coil structures  <cit> .

in order to confirm the trimeric nature of the mld, electron microscopy and analytical ultra centrifugation experiments were performed. preliminary electron microscopy  negative stain studies  of purified mld show a variety of oligomers which vary in length. analytical ultra centrifugation experiments showed only protein aggregation indicating an inherent stickiness in the protein. interestingly the elution peaks in gel filtration and sucrose density gradient were well defined and narrow  indicating a single species of oligomer and also suggesting that the conditions necessary for em or analytical centrifugation lead to protein instability. we speculate that the coiled coil domains present in the mld are not long enough to cause stable association but that the mld may be a minimal oligomerisation unit and possibly also a filament nucleation unit. that the mld represents a normal assembly competent form is supported by the frap data which shows that the structure formed by the mld was dynamically similar to that formed by full length myo <dig> . however further understanding of the nature and minumum oligomerisation unit  requires detailed structural and biochemical analysis of the native myo <dig>  if the trimeric nature suggested by our experiments of the mld are indeed a property of the full length molecule, this would suggest a novel mode of contraction for the budding yeast cr as a myo <dig> trimer would have  <dig> motor domains as compared with the two motor domains present in a more conventional dimeric structure.

as well as containing a region in the tail necessary for filament formation, all non-muscle myosins also contain tail sequences that disrupt the coiled coil formation and cause the tail to kink or bend sharply  <cit> . in higher eukaryotes bending at these sites is regulated by light chain phosphorylation, whereas in d. discoideum bending is regulated by heavy chain phosphorylation. phosphorylation causes the tail to bend into a folded conformation that prevents filament formation  <cit> . we have shown that the region of low coiled coil forming probability in myo <dig>  termed the hinge, is important for cr contraction. the frap data also show that fluorescence recovery of myo1Δhinge is faster than that of the wild-type molecule. it is interesting that the mld, which possesses the hinge region, has a slower exchange half time than myo1Δhinge, suggesting that the hinge has a role in anchoring myo <dig> in the cr. taken together these data suggest that removal of the hinge prevents proper cr assembly, resulting in reduced structural stability. the inability of the hingeless cr to contract could either be due to a lack of force generation or due to rapid disassembly when under force. interestingly, lord et al  <cit>  have recently shown that the motor domain of myo <dig> is not necessary for contraction to occur at the bud neck during cytokinesis in budding yeast, though the rate of contraction is slower than wild type. this suggests that there is an additional force generating element in the budding yeast cr and that the myo <dig> tail may serve to guide this force. the hinge region may play a direct role in linking the two force generating elements. the additional force generating element acting alone in the absence of myo <dig> or in the presence of a defective myo <dig> could come from chs <dig>  the enzyme that synthesizes and deposits chitin during cytokinesis and this synthetic energy could be used to drive membrane closure  <cit> . normally this force would be coupled with the force generated by myo <dig> and we speculate that the tail of myo <dig> may interact directly with chs <dig>  future studies will examine the localisation of other bud neck components in the presence of the mld or the hingeless myo <dig> to see if their localisation is perturbed. this will further our understanding of the cytokinetic defects caused by the loss of hinge in myo <dig> and of how it interacts with other bud neck components.

finally, how does the mld compare with the localisation determinants of other class ii myosins? in fission yeast myo <dig>  the region required for localization is different: it was shown that a small c-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient for localisation to the contractile ring  <cit> . phosphorylation plays a regulatory role in myo <dig> localisation, though there is disagreement over the exact residues involved. there is also evidence that the very c-terminus of budding yeast myo <dig> is phosphorylated  <cit> , but the precise residues and function of this phosphorylation are not known. our results showing localisation in a myo <dig> construct lacking the c-terminus  suggest that this phosphorylation would not be required for myo <dig> localisation.

it remains open whether myosin-ii recruitment is mediated by a specific interaction, with certain components of the cell division site, or by an interaction that requires certain structural features of the myosin-ii complex assembly. regardless, the mld can be used as bait for the identification of the binding partners responsible for the recruitment of myosin-ii to the bud neck. however, given the potential requirement for structural determinants and the fact that direct recruiting factors for myosin-ii have yet to be found, we speculate that recruitment of myosin-ii may be mediated by multiple low affinity interactions that rely on structural assembly of the cr and may not be detectable by conventional solution-based assays for protein interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that a small defined region in tail of budding yeast myosin ii, the mld, is necessary and sufficient for localisation. we show that when expressed in bacteria or in yeast, this domain behaves like a trimer rather than like the more traditional class ii myosin dimer, raising the possibility that if the trimeric nature holds for the full length myo <dig>  the structure of the cr in budding yeast might be different than were it composed in part of a dimeric myosin ii. the similarity between the dynamics of the mld and full length budding yeast myosin ii in vivo as explored through our frap studies lends confidence that the mld assembly in vivo is structurally similar to that of full length myo <dig>  we also show that the mld encompasses a region of low coiled coil forming probability  which, when removed, does not abolish myosin ii localisation to the bud neck, the site of cell division, but does prevent proper contraction of the cr during cytokinesis. we propose that this hinge region may interact directly with other components of the cr and that its loss leads to a more dynamic, less anchored molecule as shown by the faster fluorescent turnover seen in our frap studies in comparison with the mld and full length protein.
