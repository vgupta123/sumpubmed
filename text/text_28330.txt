BACKGROUND
chemokines are a family of small , inducible, structurally related proteins, which mediate chemotaxis of various cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils and fibroblasts to sites of inflammation  <cit>  and are implicated in many biological processes, such as migration of leukocytes, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis etc  <cit> . the biological activities of chemokines are mediated via chemokine receptors, which belong to a large family of rhodopsin-like g-protein-coupled, seven transmembrane domain receptors  <cit> . chemokines and their receptors were divided into four families  on the basis of cysteine residues in the ligands   <cit> . recently, a system of nomenclature was introduced in which each ligand and receptor is identified by its subfamily with an identifying number  <cit> . thus, there exist ccr1- <dig>  cxcr1- <dig>  xcr <dig> , and cx3cr <dig>   <cit> .

in human and mouse, seven different cxc chemokine receptors denoted as cxcr <dig> to cxcr <dig> have so far been reported, and these cxc chemokine receptors have roles in chemotaxis of neutrophils, attraction of th <dig> cells, or effector of t cell generation  <cit> . genomic structure and expression of five cxcrs including cxcr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> have been characterized either in model fish and/or in economically important fish species. for example, cxcr <dig> has been reported in several species of fish, such as common carp cyprinus carpio and mandarin fish siniperca chuatsi  <cit> ; cxcr <dig> in common carp  <cit> ; cxcr <dig> in grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella  <cit> ; cxcr <dig> in sea lamprey petromyzon marinus, zebrafish danio rerio, common carp, rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss, sterlet acipenser ruthenus  <cit> , cxcr <dig> in zebrafish and medaka oryzias latipes  <cit> . in teleost fish, the literature on the function of cxc chemokine receptors is rather limited. it was only recently reported that two cxcr <dig> genes, cxcr4a and cxcr4b, isolated in zebrafish had roles in the development and migration of cranial neural crest cells  <cit> . similar to cxcr <dig>  it was demonstrated that cxcr <dig>  which was recently revealed to recognize the chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor- <dig>   <cit> , played an essential role in primordium migration  <cit> , and cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> are antagonistic in control of cell migration in the development of the posterior lateral line  <cit> .

cxcr <dig> was first reported from human burkitt's lymphoma  <cit> , whereafter the murine homologue of cxcr <dig> was cloned and its expression was found in a pattern similar to human cxcr <dig>  <cit> . in mammals, cxcr <dig> and its ligand cxcl <dig> are responsible for the organization of b cell follicles and the migration of b and t cells  <cit> , and involved in other functions such as in the attraction of human metastatic neuroblastoma cells to the bone marrow  <cit> . however, cxcr <dig> has not been identified in any species of fish so far. in this study, cxcr <dig> was cloned from the grass carp c. idella, an important fish in aquaculture industry of china  <cit> . furthermore, its expression was examined in different organs/tissues, and in response to the stimulation of peptidoglycan , lipopolysaccharide , polyinosinic-polytidylic acid sodium salt  and phytohaemagglutinin .

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of grass carp cxcr <dig> cdna
the grass carp cxcr <dig>  cdna  consists of  <dig> bp with a  <dig> bp 5' untranslated region  and a  <dig> bp 3'-utr with poly addition signal  and two mrna instability motifs . the open reading frame of gccxcr <dig> cdna encodes  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . analysis of the putative amino acid sequence by tmpred program suggests that gccxcr <dig> is a membrane protein with seven transmembrane helices between amino acids 65- <dig>  99- <dig>  136- <dig>  176- <dig>  230- <dig>  272- <dig> and 314- <dig> . the extracellular regions of the gccxcr <dig> contain four cysteines, presumably forming disulfide bonds. in the transmembrane regions tm3-tm <dig> existed respectively two other cysteine residues. moreover, there are two cysteine intracellular regions at the carbon terminal. analysis using signal p-n program showed that gccxcr <dig> has no signal peptide, but has a potential n-glycosylation sites at n <dig>  using the scanprosite programs in prosite database http://ca.expasy.org/prosite, a sequence cgslllacisvdrylai  containing the g-protein-coupled receptor family  <dig> signature was identified. it was also revealed that the gccxcr <dig> sequence contains camp- and cgmp- dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites , tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site , n-myristoylation sites , protein kinase c phosphorylation sites , and casein kinase ii phosphorylation sites  .

the deduced amino acid sequence of the gccxcr <dig> protein was compared with other chemokine receptors by calculating the sequence identities using the megalign program. the full-length amino acid sequence of gccxcr <dig> has the highest identities with zebrafish cxcr <dig> , followed by stickleback cxcr <dig>  and fugu cxcr <dig> . the identifies of gccxcr <dig> with cxcr <dig> from human, mouse, rat and chicken are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the identity between gccxcr <dig> and other reported chemokine receptors, cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  ranges among  <dig> - <dig> %,  <dig> - <dig> %,  <dig> - <dig> %,  <dig> - <dig> %,  <dig> - <dig> %, and  <dig> - <dig> %, respectively. in the phylogenetic tree based on amino-acid sequences from four cxcr <dig>  three cxcr <dig>  eight cxcr <dig>  six cxcr <dig>  seven cxcr <dig>  two cxcr <dig> and four cxcr <dig> sequences, the gccxcr <dig> was clustered closely  with cxcr <dig> in other fish species, and then with other cxcr <dig> in higher vertebrates , and all other cxcrs with same identified number were clustered into a same clade, except that cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> were clustered together.

characterization of gccxcr <dig> genomic dna
the gccxcr <dig> gene has a length of  <dig> bp . using blast <dig>  the alignment of gccxcr <dig> cdna sequence with gccxcr <dig> genomic sequence revealed that the gccxcr <dig> gene is composed of two exons and one intron. the first exon is  <dig> bp in length, containing a short 5'-utr and orf of  <dig> amino acids . the second exon is  <dig> bp in length, coding for the all seven transmembrane domains of gccxcr <dig>  the intervening intron is  <dig> bp. the exon-intron junction follows the consensus rule of the splice donor and acceptor sites for splicing .

expression of gccxcr5
in normal fish, the expression of gccxcr <dig> was observed in all the organs/tissues examined, with strong expression in trunk kidney, spleen, intestine, head kidney, brain, muscle, but almost undetectable expression in liver and heart .

as shown in figure  <dig>  pgn injection significantly induced gccxcr <dig> expression in spleen, thymus and trunk kidney, decreased expression in brain, gill, liver and blood , but no significant difference in other organs/tissues . lps stimulation significantly increased gccxcr <dig> expression in spleen, trunk kidney, blood, intestine and head kidney , but decreased expression in brain , with no significant difference in other organs/tissues . the induced expression of gccxcr <dig> by poly i:c was observed in trunk kidney, head kidney and gill , decreased expression in brain and blood . pha significantly induced gccxcr <dig> in most organs/tissues  except brain and liver. the decreased expression of gccxcr <dig> by pha was observed in brain .

discussion
cxcr <dig>  also known as blr <dig>  has been identified as a member of the lymphocyte-specific gpcr family  <cit> . the present study for the first time reported the cdna and genomic sequences of cxcr <dig> and its expression pattern in a teleost fish, the grass carp. in general, the sequences of chemokine receptors have 25-80% aa identity. however, many other g-protein-coupled peptide receptors  also have around 25% aa identity with chemokine receptors, suggesting that the structural boundary is not very sharp. although they lack a single structural signature, there are several features that together are found more frequently among chemokine receptors than in other types of gpcrs. these include a length of 340- <dig> aa, an acidic n-terminal segment, the sequence drylaivha or a variation of it in the second intracellular loop, a short basic third intracellular loop, and a cysteine in each of the four extracellular domains. in addition, chemokine receptors contain numerous serines and threonines in the c-terminal tail that become phosphorylated after receptor-ligand interaction  <cit> . the sequence of gccxcr <dig> contains all these characters except for the length of amino acid sequences. the alignment of gccxcr <dig> amino acid sequence with cxcr <dig> sequences from other vertebrates revealed some conserved structural features. the presence of n-linked glycosylation sites at n-terminus and/or in the second extracellular loop is a common feature of chemokine receptors, as recognized by other authors  <cit> , and all the cxcr5s including gccxcr <dig> contain a conserved n-linked glycosylation sites at n terminus. furthermore, the close phylogenetic relationship between gccxcr <dig> and zebrafish cxcr <dig>  and then other teleost fish cxcr <dig> may indicate their close evolutionary relationship. this, together with other cxcr members, i.e., cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  which were clustered respectively into different clades, may reveal to some extent the conservation of these members in vertebrates, except that cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> were clustered in a same clade, as shown also by other reports  <cit> , which may imply a similar evolutionary origin of these two receptors.

similar to the genomic structures of cxcr <dig> in fugu , human , mouse  and cow , the gccxcr <dig> consists of two exons and one intron. compared with the size of mammalian cxcr <dig> genomic sequences, fish cxcr <dig> is much smaller in length. despite the difference in genomic size, vertebrate cxcr <dig> have similar size in exons.

in mammals, much effort has been focused on identifying cxcr <dig> expression in different organs/tissues and also in cell types  <cit> . murine homologue of cxcr <dig> has been described as being expressed in lymphoid organs, and murine cxcr5-specific rna is detected consistently at low levels in secondary lymphatic organs. the cxcr <dig> gene is expressed regularly and strongly in lymphomas of mature b cells but not in plasmacytomas  <cit> . in the present study, constitutive expression of cxcr <dig> was observed abundantly in trunk kidney, spleen, head kidney, intestine, muscle and brain. in vivo, grass carp cxcr <dig> expression was up-regulated mainly in immune organs such as spleen, trunk kidney, head kidney and blood, suggesting the potential function of gccxcr <dig> in immune response. the induced expression of gccxcr <dig> in a wider range of organs/tissues containing lymphocytes was consistent with the function of mammalian cxcr <dig>  as reported to attract t lymphocytes  <cit> . the immunostimulants used in the present study include pgn, lps and poly i:c, which are derived from gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacterial endotoxin and a synthetic double stranded rna  mimicking viral dsrna, respectively; and phytohaemagglutinin , known to cause leucocyte agglutination and to stimulate the proliferation of lymphocytes  <cit> . the modulated difference of gccxcr <dig> by different immunostimulants may be owing to the effect of different pattern recognition receptors  which recognize different bacterial and/or viral elements on different cell types.

on the other hand, it is difficult to explain the down-regulation of gccxcr <dig> expression in brain after pgn, lps, poly i:c and pha stimulation. however, the higher expression of gccxcr <dig> in brain was similar to gccxcr <dig> which also had abundant expression in brain  <cit> . based on the observation in mammals that cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> were expressed in central nervous system by neurons and microglial cells etc  <cit> , it is suggested that brain chemokine receptors may promote the recruitment of haematopoietic cells from circulation, both as part of normal surveillance and immunological control within the brain, and as a component of the inflammatory response  <cit> . whether this is the case for fish cxcr <dig> and other fish cxcrs requires further study.

in addition, cxcr <dig> may be modulated by other cytogenes. krumbholz et al.  <cit>  reported that about 20% of csfcd4+ cells and almost all b cells expressed the cxcl <dig> receptor cxcr <dig>  in vitro, cxcl <dig> was produced by monocytes and at a much higher level by macrophages. cxcl <dig> mrna and protein expression was induced by tnf alpha and il-1beta but inhibited by il- <dig> and ifn gamma  <cit> . however, it would be interesting to know if this is the case in fish.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, gccxcr <dig> consists of  <dig> bp, encoding  <dig> amino acids which are predicted to have seven transmembrane helices. the characteristic residues  and conserved cysteine residues are located predominantly in the extracellular regions and in the third to seventh transmembrane domains. the gccxcr <dig> was expressed in all tested organs/tissues. the expression of gccxcr <dig> was significantly modulated by peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt and phytohaemagglutinin.
