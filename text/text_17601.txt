BACKGROUND
the  <dig> canonical members of the mammalian ras gene family  code for four distinct protein isoforms  which cycle continuously between active  and inactive  conformations in a process regulated by their functional interactions with negative  and positive  cellular regulators. mammalian ras genes and proteins are widely conserved across species and are almost ubiquitously expressed in different cell lineages and organs, and they play significant roles in many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and cell death  <cit> . the wealth of ras activators and effectors identified in mammalian cells places the ras proteins at the center of multiple signaling networks critical for normal cellular development and homeostasis and for pathological processes such as cancer  <cit> .

despite earlier preconceived views of functional redundancy, most of the experimental evidence supports the notion of functional specificity for each ras family member. indeed, the high conservation across mammalian species of the specific amino acid sequence of each ras isoform at its c-terminal hypervariable  region, the distinctive patterns of expression, intracellular processing and subcellular location displayed by the fully processed protein products of the different ras gene isoforms, and the prevalent presence of specific ras oncogenes in particular types of human tumors are indicative of such functional specificity  <cit> .

genomic disruption of k-ras 4b causes embryonic lethality, whereas h-ras, n-ras and k-ras4a single-knockout  mice are perfectly viable and fertile, and simultaneous removal of h-ras and n-ras also results in viable mice with no evident phenotypic abnormalities  <cit> . joint analysis of the different ras ko animal models available indicates that only k-ras4b is necessary and sufficient for full embryonic development and suggests that k-ras performs specific function that cannot be carried out by either h-ras or n-ras. an alternative explanation  <cit>  suggests that the mortality of k-ras ko animals might not derive from the intrinsic inability of the other isoforms to substitute for k-ras function but rather from their inability to be expressed in the same cell types or developmental stages as k-ras. further insight into the functional relationships among the three different ras isoforms is now possible through the analysis of mouse strains that can be rendered “rasless” because they harbor constitutive null h-ras and n-ras alleles together with a conditionally floxed k-ras locus  <cit> .

the functional specificity of individual ras isoforms is also supported by their demonstrated ability to drive specific transcriptional programs and generate distinct genomic expression signatures in the particular cell lineages where they are expressed  <cit> . thus, our characterization of the transcriptional networks of fibroblasts harboring single or double null mutations in the h-ras and/or n-ras loci has shown that these two isoforms control different, rather antagonistic transcriptional profiles, supporting the notion of different functional roles for h-ras and n-ras in these cells, with a preferential involvement of h-ras in processes of cell growth and proliferation and n-ras in control of immune modulation/host defense and apoptotic responses  <cit> .

the analysis of ras ko cell lines has also contributed to a better understanding of the participation of different ras isoforms in control of the cell cycle  <cit> . our study of the transcriptional profiles of cells lacking h-ras and n-ras, either alone or in combination, during the early stages of the cell cycle  <cit>  suggested a preferential involvement of n-ras in immediate-early cellular responses to serum stimulation, and of h-ras in cellular responses related to growth and proliferation during mid-g <dig> progression  <cit> . also, the characterization of triple ko rasless mefs  <cit>  has further confirmed the critical requirement of ras proteins for cell cycle progression by showing the inability of rasless cells to inactivate rb pocket proteins  <cit> , suggesting that in contrast to current hypotheses ras signaling does not induce proliferation by inducing expression of d-type cyclins  <cit> . since the exact mechanisms underlying the participation of ras proteins in cell cycle activation and progression are still largely undefined, further studies are needed to determine whether the different ras isoforms play specific or redundant functional roles in those processes.

in this report, we describe a detailed characterization of the transcriptional networks of mrna and microrna that are specifically associated with the generation and reversal of the rasless phenotype. our analysis shows that the patterns of differential mrna and mirna expression in growth-arrested, rasless cells are clearly interdependent and, in addition, that they can undergo specific reversal after recovery of the proliferative ability of such cells through the introduction of activated braf or mek <dig> kinases. functional analysis of the reversible mrna and mirna profiles identified a cell cycle regulatory circuitry focused on the preferential targeting of myc-rb-e2f-dependent and cdkns-p53-dependent signalling pathways.

RESULTS
microarray analysis of transcriptomic profiles in rasless fibroblasts
“rasless” cells lacking expression of the three canonical ras genes can be generated by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen  treatment of immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts  derived from a mouse strain harboring constitutive homozygous null mutations of the h-ras and n-ras loci as well as an inducible null mutation of the k-ras locus   <cit> . under our experimental conditions, treatment of the mef cultures with 4oht for 6 days produced a significant decrease in the amount of detectable k-ras protein, whereas a 12-day treatment resulted in complete absence of any detectable ras protein in the cells . the elimination of k-ras expression was not a non-specific off-target effect of the 4oht treatment but rather a specific result of the activation of the resident cre-ert <dig> recombinase by this compound. thus, 4oht treatment of k-ras-expressing, constitutive double ko  a624- <dig> cells  <cit>  did not elicit any changes in the total amount of ras protein detectable with specific antibodies . as previously described  <cit> , the rasless cells were unable to proliferate, but did recover their proliferative ability after ectopic expression of transfected constructs coding for constitutively active downstream kinases of the ras-mapk pathway such as brafcaax and mek1q56p.

to determine whether the rasless status might be linked to specific gene expression programs, we used commercial oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the transcriptional profiles of control, untreated immortalized fibroblast cultures derived from the ko mice to those of the same cells after 4oht-induced removal of the conditional k-raslox alleles. in addition, the transcriptomes of cells reversed to proliferate after the introduction of either brafcaax or mek1q56p constructs  <cit>  were also compared with that of growth-arrested, rasless cells generated after a 12-day treatment with 4oht. for this purpose, rna extracted from pre-confluent cultures of the different sample groups was hybridized with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  arrays were used to analyze mrna expression patterns associated with the different experimental conditions analysed, whereas mouse genechip mirna arrays were used to characterize the patterns of microrna expression under the same conditions. the different sets of experimental samples analyzed here included rnas from  control proliferating cells  expressing only k-ras ;  the same cells after treatment with 4oht for 6 days or 12 days to render them non-proliferating, rasless fibroblasts ; and  proliferating rasless cells harboring transfected, activated mek <dig> or braf constructs after treatment with 4oht for 12 days .

differential gene expression patterns in rasless and braf- or mek1-rescued mefs
sam pair-wise contrast analyses provided an initial overall view of the global mrna transcriptional changes occurring in mefs devoid of expression of the  <dig> canonical ras genes. figure 1b shows that a 6-day 4oht treatment of k-raslox mefs  did not cause any significant modification in the overall transcriptional profile of these cells in comparison to untreated k-raslox cells, as determined by a sam contrast performed at a relatively high false discovery rate  value  . in contrast, in rasless mefs resulting from treatment with 4oht for 12 days, and therefore completely devoid of ras protein , up to  <dig> differentially expressed probesets  could be identified, even using a much lower  fdr value . a complete list of the differentially expressed probesets observed in the 12-day 4oht rasless cells is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  where the parameters of statistical significance for the level of overexpression or repression of each probeset are also shown.

interestingly, rescue of the proliferative ability of the rasless cells by expressing activated braf or mek <dig>  <cit>  also reversed most of the transcriptional alterations previously identified as being associated with the absence of k-ras. figure 1b shows that, using a similar  <dig>  fdr value for the sam contrasts, the braf-rescued cells and the mek1-rescued cells only show minor transcriptional changes in comparison with the original untreated proliferating k-raslox mefs controls .

these data indicate that the transcriptional networks integrating the set of differentially expressed genes identified in 12-day 4oht-treated rasless cells  are specifically linked to the absence of k-ras in those cells, thus representing a specific transcriptional signature of the rasless status.

characterization and functional annotation of transcriptional networks in rasless cells
a detailed list of differentially expressed loci resulting from a 12-day 4oht treatment of k-raslox mefs to render them totally rasless is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  at a highly stringent fdr value of  <dig> ,  <dig> probesets  were overexpressed, whereas  <dig> probesets  were repressed. the bulk of overexpressed loci showed amplification levels lower than 5-fold, with about 27% of them included in the 2– <dig> fold range and fewer than 5% showing amplification levels higher than ten-fold . among the genes showing high levels of r-fold overexpression, the extracellular matrix-related prelp locus as well as cytoskeleton-related loci such as mfap <dig>  fbn <dig> or afap1l <dig> or loci related to immunity or inflammatory responses such as wisp <dig>  vnn <dig> or ly6a  and ly6c <dig> can be mentioned . on the other hand, the majority of differentially expressed loci of rasless cells  showed reduced expression levels in comparison with control fibroblasts. notably, the highest level of transcriptional repression was detected in dusp <dig> , a dual-specificity phosphatase acting in ras signaling pathways. interestingly, other members of the dusp family  were also significantly repressed in rasless cells . the clear prevalence of transcriptional repression over induction in rasless cells suggests a predominant functional contribution of the  ras proteins to mechanisms of positive modulation of transcription. furthermore, as discussed later, most induced and repressed differentially expressed genes identified in rasless cells showed an exactly opposite transcriptional behavior when examined in braf-rescued or mek1-rescued cells .

using genecodis software, we searched for co-occurrence of functional annotations corresponding to go biological processes or kegg signaling pathways that could potentially be ascribed to specific subsets of the induced or repressed genes listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  this search yielded the identification of specific groups of downregulated  or upregulated  loci of rasless mefs that are related to specific biological processes at significantly high values of statistical significance.

regarding the pool of repressed genes in rasless cells, additional file 2: table s <dig>  section s2-bp identified a series of gene subsets that are functionally linked to several go categories of biological processes  with high statistical significance. among these, those most significantly affected by the transcriptional repression occurring in rasless cells were :  rna metabolism and processing  and dna metabolism and processing ;  cellular protein metabolism  and modification ;  mitotic cell cycle progression  and associated subcellular processes;  organization of the cytoskeleton and subcellular organelles in relation to chromatin architecture ;  dna repair , and  intracellular transport of rna  and protein  . in addition, consistent with the above go bp categories, genecodis analysis also identified a series of kegg signaling pathways that may potentially be disturbed by the transcriptional repression changes occurring in rasless cells. among others, the most significant included the following:  spliceosome-related signaling ; cell cycle control ;  dna replication ;  rna transport ;  mismatch repair ; and  ribosome biogenesis  .

on the other hand, specific subsets of the pool of overexpressed loci in rasless cells were functionally annotated with high statistical significance to a shorter list of go biological processes such as:  cellular protein transport and ion transport ;  cellular metabolic processes  and small gtpase-mediated signal transduction  . genecodis also identified a statistically significant accumulation of induced overexpressed loci related to kegg lysosomal signalling pathways  .

the bar plots in figure 2a summarize and quantitate the percentage distribution of induced or repressed genes from rasless fibroblasts that can be functionally ascribed to the variety of go biological processes or kegg signaling pathways identified by genecodis. as shown, a clear prevalence of repressed loci over induced loci can be seen. consistent with the phenotypic growth arrest exhibited by rasless cells in culture, a remarkable over-representation of functional categories relevant to growth arrest, such as metabolic processes, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and growth, dna repair, etc., was observed .

further support for the notion of a direct link between the absence of the three canonical ras proteins and cell cycle arrest in rasless cells was provided by studies aimed at identifying possible transcription factors that could account for the pattern of repressed genes listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> ; additional file 2: table s <dig> section s2-tf). interestingly, genecodis analysis of the pool of downregulated loci in rasless cells identified several distinct groups of repressed genes  that are known targets for transcriptional regulation by e2f or by sp <dig> at exceptionally high levels of statistical significance . in addition, several other subsets of repressed loci were also identified as specific targets for the myc, fox <dig> or egr transcription factors at high levels of significance  . consistent with this suggested pattern of negative transcriptional regulation, the mrna levels for the transcription factors myc, fox and egr were indeed significantly reduced in the transcriptome of rasless cells .

reversal of the transcriptional signature of rasless cells by activated braf or mek1
the sam contrasts depicted in figure 1b documented that the bulk of differential gene expression changes associated with the growth-arrested rasless status are absent from the transcriptional profiles of braf-rescued and mek1-rescued mefs, which are otherwise characterized by their recovered ability to proliferate after expression of either of these two activated downstream components of the ras signaling pathway  <cit> . indeed, the sam contrasts comparing the transcriptome of untransfected k-raslox mefs with those of either braf-rescued or mek1-rescued fibroblasts recognized only a very short list of transcriptional changes, of which those with the highest r-fold values  were not significant since they were also detected in the control k-raslox mefs transfected with the empty vectors used to express the exogenous braf or mek <dig> molecules . a detailed comparison of the transcriptional profile of rasless cells with those of either braf-rescued or mek1-rescued mefs showed that most transcriptional alterations typical of rasless cells  were reversed after expression of braf or mek <dig>  specifically, a total of  <dig> probesets  overexpressed in rasless cells were repressed in both braf- and mek1-rescued cells, whereas  <dig> probesets  repressed in rasless cells showed overexpression in both the braf-and mek1-rescued cells .

further visual evidence for the reversibility of the transcriptomic profile of rasless cells is provided by figure 2b, depicting a dendrogram generated by hierarchical clustering of microarray hybridization data sets corresponding to the list of differentially expressed probesets in rasless cells at fdr =  <dig> . this dendrogram allowed a clear discrimination of three main vertical branches corresponding to  non-proliferating rasless cells as well as proliferating  control k-raslox mefs and  mefs reverted to proliferate after transfection of rasless cells with braf or mek <dig> . interestingly, whereas the proliferating k-raslox mefs showed an almost opposite, antagonistic expression profile to that of the growth-arrested rasless mefs, for the most part the transcriptome of the braf- and mek1-rescued mefs regained an opposite, antagonistic expression profile to that of the rasless mefs . these observations indicate that the transcriptional alterations caused by the absence of the three canonical ras proteins can be almost completely reversed in vivo through the expression of activated components of downstream ras signaling pathways such as braf or mek <dig> 

functional annotation analysis of the horizontal gene clusters defined by the dendrogram  highlighted the most significant functional categories accounting for the opposite transcriptional signature patterns displayed by non-proliferating rasless cells in comparison with proliferating control k-raslox or braf-rescued or mek1-rescued mefs. clusters 1– <dig> included genes repressed in arrested rasless cells and overexpressed in proliferating cells, whereas clusters 7– <dig> showed completely opposite transcriptional behavior. interestingly, clusters 1– <dig> displayed a very marked statistically significant enrichment in genes linked to go bp categories such as cell cycle, mitosis and dna replication, dna-dependent transcription, and response to dna damage and dna repair, whereas cluster  <dig> displayed a significant accumulation of genes related to inactivation of mapk activity and regulation of apoptosis, and clusters 4– <dig> showed a special enrichment in genes related to rna splicing, processing and transcription. on the other hand, clusters 7– <dig> were significantly enriched in genes involved in cellular transport processes of ions and proteins, metabolic processes or small gtpase-mediated signal transduction .

in sum, analysis of the functional annotations of the different gene blocks defined by the dendrogram in figure 2b focused our initial studies mainly on the genes  that are involved in regulation of cell cycle progression and the loci  that are relevant for regulation of growth, in particular in aspects of cellular transport and metabolism.

functional gene set enrichment analysis of the reversible transcriptional signature of rasless fibroblasts. identification of the most significant components
as mentioned in previous sections, more than 80% of the transcriptional alterations occurring in rasless cells are reversed by activated braf or mek <dig> molecules. indeed,  <dig> loci overexpressed in rasless cells  were repressed in both braf- and mek1-rescued cells , whereas  <dig> genes repressed in rasless cells  showed overexpression in both the braf- and mek1-rescued cells  . however, in order to identify the most relevant transcriptional alterations associated with the rasless status, we focused our initial analysis on the loci identified by means of venn diagrams  depicting the intersections occurring among the lists of differential gene expression  of non-proliferating rasless cells and proliferating, braf-rescued and mek1-rescued cells. figure 3a depicts a venn diagram identifying  <dig> induced genes of the transcriptome of rasless cells that were also simultaneously listed as repressed loci in the tables of differential expression resulting from comparing rasless cells to the braf-rescued or mek1-rescued mefs. similarly, figure 3b identifies  <dig> repressed genes of rasless cells that were simultaneously identified as induced in both the braf- and mek1- rescued mefs. a detailed description of this restricted pool of induced and repressed loci of rasless cells showing exactly opposite expression pattern in both the braf-rescued and mek1-rescued mefs is shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  although many more differentially expressed genes are actually rescued by braf or mek <dig> , this initial report focuses mainly on studying the functional significance of the loci listed in additional file 4: table s <dig>  which potentially represent the core of most significant loci regarding the transcriptional changes relevant for the generation and/or reversal of the rasless status, since their high fdr value  is indicative of very reproducible and/or high r-fold transcriptional changes.

additional file 5: table s <dig> displays genecodis functional analyses of the genes listed in additional file 4: table s <dig>  the results show that repressed loci linked to the rasless status are significantly associated to the regulation of various cell division steps as well as dna/rna metabolic processes including -among other categories- dna replication, regulation of dna-dependent transcription, rna splicing and processing and response to dna damage and dna repair . on the other hand, the rasless status also appeared to be significantly associated to overexpression of loci related to cellular transport . a summary of the most significant go functional categories affected by the rasless status is shown in panel 3c. this graph confirms our previous functional analyses  and also indicates that  cell cycle progression,  dna/rna processing and metabolism related to cellular growth, and  cellular responses to stress and dna damage are the most prominently targeted cellular biological processes that may be altered under the rasless status .

diversity of cellular mechanisms responsible for the reversible transcriptional changes of rasless cells. sca <dig> differential expression as a model
the wide variety of statistically significant transcriptional alterations occurring in rasless cells as regards the expression of components of signaling pathways  documents the availability of a great diversity of potential biochemical regulatory mechanisms able to contribute, at the molecular level, to the generation of their altered transcriptomic profiles. thus, it is apparent that the mechanistic details involved in the generation of the transcriptional profile of each differentially expressed gene of rasless mefs will ultimately have to be ascertained on an individual basis.

as a representative example, here we report data relevant to the generation of, and possible mechanisms involved in, the patterns of differential expression of sca <dig>  in rasless cells . sca <dig> is associated with murine stem cell self-renewal  <cit> , and the modulation of its expression has profound effects on cellular function and tumor development  <cit> . our initial microarray-based mrna expression data showed that sca <dig>  is one of the most significantly upregulated loci in growth-arrested rasless cells  as compared to proliferating k-raslox control mefs, and that its overexpression is reversed in braf-rescued and mek1-rescued mefs . interestingly, related loci such as ly6c <dig> , ly6/neurotoxin  and slurp <dig>  follow similar patterns of upregulation and reversal in rasless and rescued mefs . the mrna transcriptional data were further confirmed at the level of protein expression by means of facs analysis using specific antibodies . our data show that treatment of control, k-raslox cells with 4oht for 6d or 12 days to render them rasless resulted in a significant enhancement  of the sca <dig> protein levels detectable in these cells. of note is that 6-day 4oht-treated and 12-day-treated rasless cells showed similar sca <dig> protein levels, suggesting that sca <dig> upregulation is an early effect linked mechanistically to the process of disappearance of k-ras from these cells . in contrast, our facs analysis of the braf-rescued and mek1-rescued mefs also showed a complete recovery of sca <dig> protein expression to levels similar to those measured in the control k-raslox cells . consistent with previous reports indicating that sca <dig> acts downstream from stat <dig>  <cit> , a test of the effect of inhibitors of specific signaling molecules on the patterns of expression of sca <dig> in our k-raslox cells showed that specific jak inhibitors produced a progressive, time-dependent reversal of the elevated levels of sca <dig> expression associated with the disappearance of k-ras . these observations suggest that the jak-stat signaling pathway is a significant component of the transcriptional regulatory machinery of sca <dig> in these mefs.

we also tested the feasibility of modulating sca <dig> protein expression levels in our mefs by means of specific shrna constructs. thus, using non-targeting shrna particles as control, we observed that specific shrna-sca <dig> particles produced a very significant reduction in sca <dig> protein expression levels in both proliferating k-raslox cells and in growth-arrested rasless cells generated after extended treatment with 4oht . however, the significant reduction in sca <dig> expression in rasless cells was not accompanied by recovery of their proliferative ability, as determined by means of mtt proliferation assays  and by wb measurements of the levels of various specific cell progression markers . interestingly, the mtt assays revealed a slight increase of the rate of proliferation of the k-raslox cells transduced with shrna-sca <dig> particles in comparison with the controls , in agreement with previous reports of hyperproliferation of sca <dig> ko cell lineages  <cit> .

these data show that the growth-arrested phenotype of rasless cells cannot be corrected by reversal of expression levels of sca <dig> alone. this would be expected, since the rasless phenotype is linked to multiple transcriptional alterations  and hence its correction probably requires the reversal of the expression patterns of many more loci than just sca <dig>  in particular those with pivotal functional roles in signaling networks involved in global pleitropic control of cell cycle progression and arrest.

transcriptional changes targeting regulators of early cell cycle progression in rasless cells
our previous functional annotation analyses unveiled a significant enrichment in cellcycle-related genes within the content of several gene clusters defined by the dendrogram comparing the profiles of differential expression of rasless cells . we also described that expression of activated braf or mek <dig> is sufficient to reverse the growth arrest of rasless cells, as well as a large percentage of the associated transcriptional alterations . searching for mechanistic clues about the phenotypic growth arrest exhibited by rasless cells, we performed detailed cell cycle facs analyses of our 4oht-treated rasless cell cultures . consistent with previous observations  <cit> , our results revealed a predominant blockade in progression through the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle . this effect was k-ras-specific because it was not observed in 4oht-treated cultures of the control constitutive n-ras/h-ras double ko cells not harboring the 4oht-sensitive cre recombinase and the floxed k-ras allele .

analysis of the transcriptomic patterns exhibited by rasless cells offered further clues about their growth-arrest phenotype, since a significant subset of the reversible transcriptomic alterations described in rasless cells are functionally related to control of early cell cycle progression and cell division . in particular, panel 4b shows a heatmap describing the transcriptional behavior of a series of positive and negative regulators of cell cycle progression in control, rasless, and braf- or mek1-rescued fibroblasts. this dendrogram defines two vertically defined branches that discriminate absolutely between the non-proliferating rasless cells and proliferating, control k-raslox and the braf- or mek1-rescued cells. in addition, the horizontal branches identify two clearly distinct sets of repressed and overexpressed genes, thus revealing a largely opposite transcriptional behavior between the growth-arrested, non-proliferating rasless fibroblasts and the proliferating, k-raslox and braf- or mek1-rescued fibroblasts . consistent with the phenotypic g <dig> arrest observed in rasless cells, additional file 1: table s <dig> and the heatmap in figure 4b identify in the rasless clones a large group of significantly repressed genes coding for cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases , myc and myc targets , and other positive regulators of early cell cycle progression . in addition, a smaller group of overexpressed genes, coding for negative/feedback regulators of cell cycle progression such as tgfb <dig>  smad <dig>  gadd45b, or the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors cdkn1a , cdkn2b  and cdkn2a , was also identified . in contrast, an approximately opposite pattern of induction and repression for all these loci was found in the dendrogram branches corresponding to proliferating fibroblasts, including control k-raslox cells as well as braf- and mek1-rescued fibroblasts . in confirmation of a previous report  <cit> , cyclin d <dig> levels did not change in rasless cells  but were highly overexpressed in the braf- and mek1-rescued cells in comparison to rasless cells . also highly consistent with arrest at an early stage of the cell cycle was the observation of a significant downregulation of the expression of multiple e2f-targets  <cit>  including cyclins a <dig> and f, cdc <dig> and cdc25a, several mcm  proteins, and other cycle regulators such as myc, rbl <dig>  dhfr or dbf <dig>  in the non-proliferating rasless cells. such downregulation disappeared, showing the opposite pattern of expression , in proliferating control k-raslox as well as in braf- and mek1-rescued fibroblasts .

confirmation, at the level of protein expression, of some of these transcriptional alterations was obtained by means of western immunoblots using available specific antibodies, which documented the progressive reduction or disappearance of different cyclins, cdks and pcna in two independent representative clones of  cells treated with 4oht to remove k-ras expression . as a control, treatment of double ko  a624- <dig> cells, which still express k-ras constitutively  <cit> , did not disclose any change in the expression level of cyclin b <dig> or cdk <dig> , indicating that the above changes are not off-target effects of the 4oht treatment.

the patterns of transcriptional downregulation of myc, e2f targets, cyclins and cdks are consistent with the g1/s blockade observed experimentally by flow cytometry in rasless cells. consistent with recent reports demonstrating the essential role of myc in k-ras-driven tumorigenesis  <cit> , the strong myc phenotype displayed by rasless cells is noteworthy, as seen from the detection of direct transcriptional repression of the myc proteins  as well as of many recognized myc transcriptional targets . furthermore, our additional observations in rasless cells of roughly unchanged levels of cyclin d <dig>  together with the significant upregulation of cdk inhibitors such as cdkn1a , cdkn2b  and cdkn2a , are consistent with a previous report challenging the previously accepted notion that ras signalling initiates the cell cycle by inducing expression of d-type cyclins  <cit>  and suggesting that p <dig> may be mechanistically involved in preventing cell proliferation in the absence of ras proteins  <cit> . indeed, since e2f proteins and targets are controlled by rb, and since rb loss is known to override the requirement for downstream erk signalling for cell proliferation  <cit> , and p <dig> is a transcriptional target of p <dig>  <cit> , the previous hypothesis might be tested experimentally by checking whether or not the downregulation of rb, p <dig> or cdkns , individually or in combination, could contribute to bypassing the proliferative defects of rasless cells and restoring their proliferative ability in a manner similar to that observed with activated braf or mek <dig> molecules. our analyses of mirna profiles in rasless and rescued mefs  are also consistent with these views.

differential expression of micrornas in rasless mefs
in order to uncover additional cellular mechanisms responsible for the reversible cell cycle arrest and altered transcriptional pattern of rasless cells, we performed genecodis analyses that identified –with very high levels of statistical significance- a series of specific mirnas potentially capable of generating large blocks of the repressed  or induced  mrnas of rasless mefs listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in order to test these predictions experimentally and to identify specific mirna alterations linked to the rasless status, we carried out specific microarray hybridizations using mirna preparations from defined sample sets, including control, untreated k-raslox mefs as well as 4oht-treated cultures leading to the rasless status, or braf- and mek1-rescued cell lines . we observed that partial k-ras removal achieved after 6 days of 4oht treatment allowed detection of a reduced number of differentially expressed mirnas, but that total elimination of ras proteins after 12 days of 4oht treatment allowed the identification of at least  <dig> distinct mirnas that were differentially expressed in the rasless cells at the statistically significant fdr value of  <dig>  . a detailed description of the list of  <dig> mirnas that were specifically induced or repressed in mefs after reaching the rasless status is shown in table  <dig>  as happened with the differentially expressed mrnas , the majority  of the differentially expressed mirnas of 12-day 4oht-treated rasless cells were repressed , indicating a predominant functional role of the missing k-ras as a positive regulator of mirna transcription. the relevance of this group of differentially expressed mirnas with regards to the rasless phenotype is further supported by the observation that the majority  of differentially expressed mirnas listed in table  <dig> were predicted  by genecodis analyses  of the list of differentially expressed mrnas in additional file 1: table s <dig> . table  <dig> also shows that a small group of these differentially expressed mirnas were already present in 6-day 4oht-treated cells. the rapid response and the sensitivity shown by the differential expression of this subgroup of mirnas to the partial disappearance of k-ras in the 6-day 4oht-treated mefs  suggests the potential significance of their differential expression in relation to the initial steps of generation of the rasless phenotype.

list of  <dig> differentially expressed micrornas  identified by means of pair-wise sam contrasts  comparing the microarray-generated mirna transcriptional profile of 12-day 4oht rasless mefs with that of control untreated k-raslox mefs. the last three columns on the right show data corresponding to independent pair-wise comparisons between 6-day 4oht-treated mefs and untreated k-raslox control mefs, and comparisons between braf-rescued or mek1-rescued cells and rasless mefs . the differentially expressed mirnas are identified by the affymetrix mirna probeset id, mirna name, mirna family, chromosome location and mirna cluster to which they belong . all mirna members of the same cluster that show concomitant differential expression in rasless cells are written in bold. the genecodis prediction column shows the p-values of statistical significance for predictions of the indicated mirnas made by genecodis analysis of the list of repressed or induced  mrnas of rasless cells . d-value quantifies the degree of overexpression  or repression  and is a parameter measuring the statistical distance separating the calculated expression value of each gene probeset from the null hypothesis . p-value is a statistical measurement indicating the probability of random expression for that probeset. q-value is the estimated fdr at the highest p-value for which the probeset would be statistically significant. r-fold is a measurement of the fold-change of a probeset in the collection of the microarrays provided by the sam algorithm. independent confirmation of the microarray-generated r-fold values of differential expression for several randomly selected mirnas was obtained by means of qrt-pcr using specific primers which generated the data indicated by the # symbols and the actual fold values included in the square . “n.a.”: not applicable at fdr =  <dig> . in some cases, the braf- and mek1-rescued samples showed the opposite transcriptional behavior  in comparison with the rasless samples but their respective r-fold parameters are still shown here as “n.a.” because the corresponding fdr value of the overall contrasts was higher than  <dig>  under the experimental conditions used.

the functional significance of our microarray-based mirna profile with regards to generation/maintenance of the rasless status was further supported by the observation of a remarkable accumulation of members of specific mirna families  and/or clusters . in particular, this differential mirna expression profile identified at least  <dig> distinct mirna families, including two or more individual mirna species . in particular, the pool of repressed mirnas of rasless cells included at least  <dig> different members of the mir- <dig> family,  <dig> members of the mir- <dig> family,  <dig> members of the let- <dig> and mir- <dig> families, and  <dig> members each of a number of distinct mirna families such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  additionally, at least  <dig> different mirna families  were also identified that included  <dig> or more of their members in this list of upregulated rasless mirna species .

it is also noteworthy that a large percentage of the differentially expressed mirnas of rasless cells were concentrated in specific genomic locations, frequently sharing their physical location within the same mirna cluster or the same chromosome. table  <dig> identifies at least  <dig> different mirna clusters holding two or more differentially expressed mirnas of rasless cells. the physical proximity shared by a large percentage of differentially expressed mirnas of rasless cells, together with the fact that all members of a given cluster often share common regulatory mechanisms, is also supportive of the notion that the mirna profile identified in table  <dig> may be mechanistically and/or functionally relevant as regards the generation or maintenance of the rasless status.

analysis of functional annotations available in the scientific literature and mirna databases indicated that the majority of mirnas listed in table  <dig> can be classified as “oncomirs”, since they have previously been reported to contribute to the development of tumorigenic processes  <cit> . among the repressed mirnas, we found  <dig> members of the let- <dig> family  and, in particular,  <dig> different members of the mir- <dig> family  and  <dig> different members of the mir- <dig> family  which are distributed among three different clusters  located, respectively, in mouse chromosomes  <dig>  x and  <dig> .

the involvement of the mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster in human cancer has been known for a long time  <cit> . in particular, this cluster was proposed as a diagnostic tool in large b-cell malignancies  <cit>  and different reports have described its overexpression or amplification in various cancer types including b cell lymphomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, lung cancer, and liposarcomas  <cit> . the oncogenic potential of the components of the mir-106a ~ 20b ~  <dig> cluster and their involvement in t-cell leukemia  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit>  and gastrointestinal tumors  <cit>  has also been described. the involvement of members of mir-106b ~  <dig> cluster in prostate  <cit> , gastric  <cit> , hepatic  <cit>  and glioblastoma multiforme tumors is also documented  <cit> . the members of the mir-212 ~  <dig> cluster are among the most strongly downregulated mirs in rasless cells  and previous reports have described their functional contribution to pancreatic  <cit>  and non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . the downregulated mir- <dig>  has also been previously linked to b-cell-related cancers and shown to be upregulated in pediatric burkitt’s and hodgkin lymphomas  <cit> . finally, the downregulated components of the mir-222 ~  <dig> cluster  are amplified in papillary thyroid carcinomas  <cit>  and the components of the mir-183 ~  <dig> cluster  have been linked to development of medulloblastomas  <cit> , lung cancer  <cit>  and gliomas  <cit> .

the pool of upregulated mirnas identified in rasless cells is less extensive and is limited to components of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families and, in particular, the individual mir- <dig> and mir-181a which show the highest r-fold overexpression values in rasless cells . different reports have identified mir- <dig> as a prognostic indicator in gastric cancer  <cit>  and gliomas  <cit> , whereas the overexpressed mir-181a has been reported to modulate t cell sensitivity and selection  <cit>  and to contribute to human myeloid leukemia  <cit> . additionally, the members of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families have been shown to play pro-angiogenic roles in tumors  <cit>  and, in particular, the individual mir-30c has been reported to directly target the 3′utr region of k-ras in hereditary breast cancers  <cit> .

all in all, the list of related tumors and canonical targets identified in the scientific literature for each differentially expressed mirna listed in table  <dig> may provide significant functional clues regarding the specific mechanisms and causal relationships linking the mirna profile of rasless cells  to the generation/maintenance of the transcriptomic mrna profile and phenotype of rasless cells.

reversibility of the microrna expression profile of rasless cells and inferred mechanistic implications
further confirmation of the functional significance of our microarray-generated profile of differential mirna expression is provided by the observation that most alterations of mirna expression identified in the growth-arrested rasless cells were fully reversed, in exactly the opposite direction of induction or repression, in the proliferating, braf-rescued and mek1-rescued mefs . interestingly, the differential expression of most of these “reversible” mirs was predicted by genecodis with very high statistical significance from the profile of induced and repressed mrnas occurring in rasless cells . indeed, those reversals affected more than 55% of all differentially expressed mirnas in rasless cells, and frequently affected all members of specific mirs families or clusters . thus, it was particularly noticeable that all members of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families  showed opposite transcriptional behavior between the proliferating, braf- or mek1-rescued cells  and the growth-arrested rasless cells  . a similar reversal was also observed with all mirs located in specific clusters, such as mir-212 ~  <dig> , mir-183 ~  <dig> or mir-222 ~  <dig> . reversal from downregulated  to upregulated  was also observed in a number of individual mirs, including mir- <dig>  mir-29a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  quantitatively, the mirnas of the mir-183 ~  <dig>  mir-222 ~  <dig>  mir-17 ~  <dig> and mir-106a ~  <dig> clusters, as well as in the individual mir- <dig> and mir-29a, showed the highest rebound from downregulation to upregulation . in contrast, mir-23b and mir-27b  were upregulated in rasless cells and clearly downregulated in both braf- and mek1-rescued mefs . in particular, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were the most highly upregulated individual mirs identified in rasless cells that were also simultaneously detected as being downregulated in both braf- and mek1-rescued mefs . additionally, mir-27a and the mir-30a, mir-30b and mir-30c  were also upregulated in rasless cells but transcriptional reversal was only detectable for mir-27a and mir-30a in mek1-rescued cells. in other cases, such as the downregulated let- <dig> family members or the upregulated mir-10b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-487b and mir- <dig>  no reversal of their transcriptional pattern was detected .

direct visual evidence of the reversibility of the mirna profile of rasless cells is provided by the heatmap in figure 5b, depicting a multiclass comparison resulting from hierarchical clustering of the microarray-based mirna profiles of control, rasless, and braf- or mek1-rescued mef clones. this dendrogram shows a clear discrimination among three main vertical branches corresponding to  control, proliferating k-raslox mefs,  the braf- or mek1-rescued mefs and  the non-proliferating, rasless cells . remarkably, the profiles of the braf- and mek1-rescued mefs showed an expression pattern that was antagonistic to that of rasless cells, thus regaining a mirna profile that approached that of the original proliferating control k-raslox mefs .

mechanistic implications inferred from the reversible mirna expression patterns of rasless cells
we attempted to identify the most salient reversible mirna alterations with regards to the generation and/or maintenance of the rasless status by means of venn diagrams identifying mirs from table  <dig> that showed an exactly opposite pattern of differential expression  between rasless cells and both the braf-rescued and mek1-rescued proliferating mefs . this approach identified at least  <dig> distinct repressed mirs and  <dig> overexpressed mirs of rasless cells fulfilling that condition . this particular group of  <dig> mirs potentially represents the core of most functionally relevant mirs with regards to the mechanisms involved in the generation and/or reversal of the rasless phenotype.

an overall view of the most significant cellular functional categories predicted  <cit>  to be affected by this pool of rasless mirnas is represented in figure 6c. interestingly, this analysis recognized a set of general go functional categories that are highly coincident with those previously identified in a similar analysis of the pool of reversible mrnas of rasless cells . among others, these included the following: transport , protein phosphorylation , small gtpase-mediated signalling  and dna/rna processing  .

focusing on the identity of the individual mirs in this group, it was striking to observe a significant enrichment in mirs belonging to a short list of specific mir clusters and families  characterized by their shared ability to target several specific cellular regulators participating in modulation of cell cycle progression/arrest checkpoints, response to dna damage stress and apoptosis. it is likely that the pleiotropic sum of all these different, mir-based modulatory interactions  may contribute, at least in part, to the growth arrest/proliferation processes involved in generation and/or reversal of the rasless phenotype. in this regard, the reversal of the expression patterns of all members of the highly related mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families  is particularly striking . although some have been cited as being involved in aging processes  <cit> , most members of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families have been implicated in cell cycle control and regulation of tumor development through a variety of mechanisms involving the specific targeting of modulators and checkpoint sensors for processes of cell cycle progression/arrest, dna damage stress response and apoptosis, including in particular rb, e2f, p <dig> and p <dig>  thus, a defined set of  <dig> mirs, including mir- <dig> and the mir-106a ~ 20b cluster components has been identified as a regulatory intermediate for coordinating p <dig> with mapk signaling through the targeting of different signaling molecules including rb, p <dig> and multiple mapks  <cit> . overexpressed mir-106a alone has been shown to downregulate rb in colorectal cancer  <cit>  and t cell leukemia  <cit>  as well as to inhibit apoptosis by targeting fas in gastric cancer  <cit> , whereas mir-20b has been reported to target pro-angiogenic modulators in breast cancer cells  <cit> .

the mechanistic relevance of the mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster with regards to cell cycle regulation is also clearly established  <cit>  since this cluster is recognized as the central element of a complex regulatory network that tightly controls proliferative signals in a variety of biological contexts. specifically, this polycistronic mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster is known to carry out pleiotropic functions modulating proliferation, apoptosis and survival in different cellular contexts via its participation in a complex networked myc-mir-17 ~ 92-e2f genetic circuit in which myc regulates expression of the mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster components and, in turn, these components of the cluster negatively target and regulate expression of e2f family members  <cit> . this mir-17 ~ 92-mediated regulatory circuitry  <cit> , which targets the rb pathway  <cit>  through modulation of e2f factors  <cit> , is highly consistent with our experimental observation of mir-17 ~  <dig> downregulation in growth-arrested rasless cells and upregulation in braf or mek1-rescued mefs , as well as with the detection of disappearance of a number of e2f targets in rasless cells and their re-appearance in braf- and mek1-rescued cells . whereas the rb-e2f pathway appears to be the primary target of mir-17 ~  <dig>  this cluster has also been reported to modulate other targets capable of modulating cell cycle progression or arrest through other pathways. of particular interest in this regard is a report showing that synthetic lethality between rb, p <dig> and dicer or mir17 ~  <dig> in retinal progenitors suppresses retinoblastoma  <cit> , thus adding another mechanistic connection between rb-dependent pathways and p53-dependent pathways to the variety of pleiotropic effects of this cluster with respect to the control of cell cycle progression and arrest. such pleiotropic mode of action is also supported by a report indicating that this cluster acts by upregulating p21cip <dig> in retinoblastomas  <cit> , and by our experimental detection of enhanced levels of p <dig> in rasless cells .

the overlapping members of the mir-106b ~  <dig> cluster and the mir- <dig> family also display opposite patterns of expression in rasless cells and in braf- and mek1-rescued cells , and analysis of their canonical targets and biological effects offers additional mechanistic explanations for the reversible proliferative phenotypes of rasless mefs. in particular, the members of the mir-106b ~  <dig> cluster have been shown to interfere with cell survival and apoptosis in different tumor systems  <cit> via targeting of a variety of modulators of cell cycle progression or checkpoint functions, thus providing a mechanistic basis for cross-talk between rb- and p21- and pten-dependent pathways  <cit> . thus, the mir-106b ~  <dig> cluster has been shown to target pten in prostate tumors  <cit>  or e2f <dig> in hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  and gastric tumors, where it impairs tgfβ-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . in particular, the members of this cluster have been reported to target and downregulate p21/cdkn1a levels in multiple tumour systems  <cit> , an observation highly consistent with our experimental observation of increased levels of cdkns  in rasless cells . in addition, mir- <dig> alone has also been reported to target apoptotic modulators in different tumor types  <cit> . of interest in this regard is the recent identification, in glioblastoma multiforme, of a mir/tp <dig> feedback autoregulatory circuit involving expression of p <dig>  e2f <dig> and myc to regulate expression of mir- <dig>  which in turn controls p <dig> accumulation  <cit> , most likely via direct targeting of the 3′utr region of tp <dig>  <cit> .

the parallel transcriptional behavior of the components of clusters mir-212 ~  <dig>  mir-222 ~  <dig> and mir-183 ~  <dig>  adds further support to the notion of a mir-based, coordinated regulatory circuitry involved in cross-talk between pro- and anti-proliferative and apoptotic/survival or dna damage response pathways that may be responsible, at least in part, for the arrested or proliferative phenotypes of rasless cells and the braf- or mek1-rescued cells. accordingly, recent reports have shown the ability of the two mir-212/mir- <dig> family members to directly target rb in pancreatic tumors  <cit>  and of mir-221/mir- <dig> to favor tumor progression through targeting of the pro-apoptotic puma  <cit>  or the tumor supressor pten, thus activating the akt pathway  <cit> . the known cellular targets of the mir-183/mir- <dig> cluster also establish a potential functional connection with dna damage response pathways in our rasless/rescued mefs, since both components of the cluster have been linked to stress-induced premature cellular senescence  responses in primary fibroblasts  <cit>  and mir- <dig> alone has also been described to target brca <dig> in breast cancer cells  <cit> . interestingly, mir-181d exhibits a parallel transcriptional pattern to that of the three clusters mentioned above and is known to directly target k-ras and blc- <dig> in gliomas, an observation suggesting additional functional links between the k-ras-related pi3k/akt and mapk/erk pathways that would be consistent with the disappearance of k-ras in rasless cells  <cit> .

mir- <dig> is the most highly overexpressed mir in rasless cells and its transcriptional pattern is also completely reversed in both the braf- and mek1-rescued mefs . recent reports have demonstrated that mir- <dig> directly targets rb in meningiomas  <cit>  as well as different genes of the non-canonical tgfβ signalling pathway in neuroblastomas  <cit> . interestingly, mechanistic analysis of cancer cell lines has shown that direct targeting of rb by mir- <dig> also establishes a proximal connection to the p53-dependent stress response since, by altering the rb levels, mir- <dig> activates the p <dig> pathway to limit cell proliferation after dna damage  <cit> . consistent with this, mir- <dig> has also been reported to be crucial for the brca <dig> regulatory cascade by targeting upstream components of the brca <dig> regulatory cascade with impact on key cellular functions such as proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . these observations strongly suggest that mir- <dig> may play a significant role in controlling proliferation by balancing the activities of the rb and p <dig> tumor suppressor pathways.

our observations suggest that this defined set of  <dig> “reversible”, differentially expressed mirnas  is mechanistically relevant for the generation/maintenance and reversal of the rasless phenotype. it is remarkable in this regard that the functional targets of this particular core of reversible mirs usually include a short list of specific targets such as rb, e2f, p <dig>  cdkns  or a few other apoptotic or checkpoint modulators  known to act in a defined group of cross-talking cellular pathways with impact on processes of cell cycle progression/arrest, apoptosis/survival, or dna damage stress responses. the notion of interdependent mrna-mirna transcriptional profiles controlling the rasless phenotype is also supported by the observation that most transcriptional alterations of these mirs were predicted, with highly significant p-values , by genecodis analysis of the list of differentially expressed mrnas of rasless cells . the disappearance of many e2f targets, or the somewhat unexpected upregulation of cdkns  in rasless cells  <cit>  , are also highly consistent experimental observations supporting such a notion.

all these considerations raise the interesting hypothesis that the set of transcriptionally reversible mirs identified in this report may constitute the core of a mir-based regulatory circuitry focused around a few specific targets such as rb, e2f or p <dig> and cdkns  capable of modulating interplay among pathways controlling proliferation, survival and dna damage stress responses that may account for the mechanisms responsible of the growth/arrest phenotype exhibited by rassles or rescued mefs. interestingly, our data uncovered specifically the myc/rb/e2f axis and the cdkns/p <dig> axis as the two main signaling contributors to this regulatory circuitry. regarding the first axis, e2f proteins and targets are controlled by rb, and rb loss is known to override the requirement for downstream erk signalling for cell proliferation  <cit> . in the second axis, p <dig> is known to be a transcriptional target of p <dig>  <cit> . therefore, a prediction directly derived from such hypothesis would be that reversion of the transcriptional patterns of downregulation or upregulation of mrna and mirna identified in rasless cells may lead to a similar reversal of the growth-arrest phenotype, as observed in braf- or mek1-rescued mefs. such a reversal could be tested experimentally in rasless cells either by the introduction of specific antagomirs or, more directly, through direct knockout or the knockdown of some of the critical core modulator targets identified in this study, such as rb, p <dig> or the cdkns . our preliminary analysis of the transcriptome of rasless mefs that recovered their proliferative ability after silencing of rb via the introduction of specific shrna constructs  <cit>  appears to support this hypothesis . indeed, the patterns of differential expression of mrnas and mirnas in these shrb-rescued cells were highly reminiscent of those of braf- and mek1-rescued cells, with the most significant components of their mrna and mirna compartments showing transcriptional behavior opposite to that seen in rasless cells .

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we characterized the transcriptional profiles of the populations of messenger rna and microrna that are differentially expressed in growth-arrested rasless fibroblasts lacking the three canonical ras family members. restoring the proliferative ability of those cells after ectopic expression of activated braf or mek <dig> resulted in the reversal of a large proportion of the transcriptional mrna and mirna alterations identified, indicating that the altered mrna and mirna expression patterns are functionally interrelated and specifically associated with the disappearance of the ras proteins in rasless cells.

classification into functional categories of the lists of differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas supported the functional relevance of the  canonical ras genes for a number of cellular functions, including dna/rna processing and metabolism, cellular transport processes, metabolite processing and, in particular, positive and negative control of cell cycle progression, programmed cell death and dna damage response. specifically, the list of differentially expressed mrnas of rasless cells involved repression of a large number of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and e2f transcription targets, as well as induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors . consistent with this, flow cytometric analysis of rasless cultures identified a predominant blockade at the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle.

analysis of the profile of differential mirna expression in rasless cells identified the reversible, altered expression of a distinct list of interrelated oncomir families and clusters including, among others, downregulation of all members of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families and upregulation of mir- <dig>  remarkably, the gene targets for most of those mirs are concentrated around a short list of signaling modulators, including in particular, rb, e2f, p <dig>  several cdkns and a few other apoptotic modulators. since these targets are known modulators of cross-talk signaling pathways regulating cell cycle progression/arrest, apoptosis/survival or response to cellular stress such as dna damage, our observations suggest that the reversible rasless phenotype may be a pleiotropic result of the interplay among several, distinct pro-and antiproliferative signaling and stress response pathways regulated by the differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas identified. this hypothesis is based on the observation of preferential targeting of myc-rb-e2f and cdkns -tp <dig> dependent pathways by the differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas identified in rasless cells, and it challenges current hypotheses for ras-driven cell cycle progression based exclusively on induction of ccnd synthesis. this hypothesis would also predict that reversing the transcriptional patterns of mrna and mirna differential expression of rasless cells may lead to a parallel restoration of their proliferative abilities, similar to what happens in braf- or mek1-rescued mefs. we suggest that the introduction of specific antagomirs or direct silencing of some or all of the critical mir target protein modulators identified in this study, such as rb, e2f, cdkns  or p <dig>  may be an adequate experimental approach to directly test such a possibility. preliminary work introducing specific shrna constructs for rb into rasless cells has indicated that silencing rb expression rescues their proliferative ability  <cit>  and significantly restores the normal mrna and mirna transcriptional profiles  in those cells.
