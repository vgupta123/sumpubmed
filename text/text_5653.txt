BACKGROUND
extensive knowledge of trout and salmon is a result of their widespread use in scientific research, as an environmental sentinel species and as a food and sport fish. perhaps more is known about the physiology, ecology, genetics, behavior and biology of salmonids than any other fish group  <cit> . this background provides a wealth of data from an economically important and phylogenetically distinct group of fish that can help guide, and benefit from, new genomic studies.

the salmonidae family includes: whitefish and ciscos ; graylings ; trout, salmon and charr   <cit> . salmonids are classified into nine genera and sixty-eight species. they are native of the cooler climates of the northern hemisphere, but have been widely introduced around the world. salmonids belong to a basal teleost protacanthopterygii suborder  group, which has been separated from other well studied euteleost lineages such as ostariophysi , and acanthopterygii  for 217– <dig> my  <cit> .

the common ancestor of salmonids is purported to have experienced a whole genome duplication event between  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> . extant salmonids are considered pseudo-tetraploid as they are in the later stages of reverting to a stable diploid state. evidence for the ancestral salmonid autotetraploid genome duplication includes: multivalent chromosome formation during male meiosis and evidence for tetrasomic segregation at some loci  <cit> ; one of the larger euteleost genome sizes  with double that of sister groups esociformes  and osmeriformes   <cit> ; homeologous chromosomal segments based on recent genetic maps and comparative studies using microsatellite markers, and duplicated gene family studies such as hox, major histocompatibility complex , growth hormone, and nineteen allozymes  <cit> .

the genome duplication in salmonids is the most recent genome duplication in this lineage. there are now a number of studies and good evidence, primarily from sequenced zebrafish and pufferfish genome sequences, for tetraploidization/rediploidization early in the ray-finned fish lineage   <cit> . several of these studies have suggested that the ancestral fish duplication, in addition to the two ancestral vertebrate genome duplications, are part of the reason why ray-finned fishes make up nearly half of all extant vertebrates species and exhibit tremendous biodiversity affecting their morphology, ecology, behavior and evolution.

vertebrate species diversity and body plan diversity have commonly been linked to genome duplications, although there is some debate on how well we can draw these conclusions based on the very old genome duplications commonly studied. mechanistically, how a genome reorganizes itself to cope with duplicated chromosomes, gene dosage effects, and the role of gene duplications for evolution and adaptation are long-standing issues in biology that remain unresolved  <cit> . the number and diversity of salmonid species, and their relatively recent genome duplication, make salmonids ideal for examining recent events that could have played such a pivotal role in generating gene diversity and species diversity found in modern vertebrates.

the genomics resources of salmonids are being rapidly expanded through a few large-scale genomics programs  <cit> . here we identify  <dig>  new ests from atlantic salmon and several other salmonid and related species in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the salmonid transcriptome, identify species relationships, identify gene duplications and introduce a new  <dig> k microarray tool for transcriptome analysis.

RESULTS
cdna libraries
new, directionally cloned, mixed tissue , normalized cdna libraries were constructed for atlantic salmon , chinook salmon , sockeye salmon , brook trout , lake whitefish , grayling , and northern pike . separate normalized libraries were constructed from salmo salar thymus, thyroid, and head kidney tissues. in addition, one full-length, mixed tissue, large insert , non-normalized library was constructed to identify longer gene transcripts. cdna clones were isolated, purified and sequenced from the 5' and 3' ends. clone numbers and insert sizes for the different libraries and species that were done as part of this study are listed in table  <dig>

transcript analysis: sequence and assembly
to obtain a comprehensive list of genes in salmonids, we used a strategy of deep 5' and 3' est sequencing from a few high quality libraries. this approach complements previous studies, which examined more limited est surveys of cdna libraries from a large number of different tissues and developmental stages  <cit> . for atlantic salmon, over  <dig>  clones were sequenced from each of the thymus, thyroid, and head kidney tissue libraries. from previously described normalized libraries,  <cit>   <dig>  additional clones were sequenced from the atlantic salmon pyloric caecum tissue library and  <dig>  additional clones were sequenced from a mixed tissue library . the total number of clones examined from the rgb <dig> library was  <dig>  which yielded  <dig>  sequence reads or 30% of the total atlantic salmon est database. even with this deep sequencing, nearly 13% of the last  <dig> reads were novel  and the maximum redundancy for a single transcript from the rgb <dig> library was  <dig> .

the results of the assembly of  <dig>  atlantic salmon ests obtained in this study along with  <dig>  ests from previous studies  are shown in table  <dig>  due to the complexities of the salmonid genome duplication and because it provides a stable, conservative starting point for all subsequent analyses, our analysis began with a first stage assembly using stringent parameters . a second stage assembly  was implemented to combine some of contigs which may be alleles, or possibly very recent gene duplications . in atlantic salmon,  <dig>  potential transcripts  were identified, of which  <dig>   were similar  to annotated sequences in cdd or swissprot protein databases. for comparison, an assembly of  <dig>  ests from rainbow trout  resulted in  <dig>  transcripts, of which  <dig>   had blastx hits. assembled contigs are available  <cit> .

transcript surveys of additional salmonid species included  <dig> – <dig>  clones sequenced from each of chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, brook trout, grayling and lake whitefish.  <dig>  sequences were obtained from chinook salmon,  <dig>  sequences from sockeye salmon,  <dig>  sequences from brook trout,  <dig>   <dig> sequences from grayling and  <dig>  sequences from lake whitefish. sequence, assembly and summary statistics are shown for those data obtained in this study  and when combined with data from public databases . in addition, to provide non-genome-duplicated sister group comparisons,  <dig>  clones were sequenced from northern pike  . for many of these species, the ests provided in this study represent nearly all or most of the known transcripts. recently published data from rainbow smelt   <cit>  was also included in table  <dig> 

to examine the relationships among the contig consensus sequences of atlantic salmon we compared all contigs  against each other by blast and plotted the number of top pair-wise alignments  with the identity score .  <dig>  contigs showed greater than 80% identity over  <dig> bp to at least one other contig. of these,  <dig>  were 97– <dig> % similar to at least one other contig. these contigs may represent alleles, recent duplicates or errors in sequence data.  <dig>  contigs show between  <dig> and  <dig> % identity with at least one other contig. the large number of duplicated transcripts observed in the atlantic salmon genome is consistent with the hypothesis of an ancestral salmonid genome duplication, though it is surprising that so many of the duplicated contigs are so similar. this observation is being pursued further in a separate study. the analysis of contig similarity shows that the majority of the  <dig>  contigs represent distinct transcripts. note that since the assembly process itself combines sequences with high levels of similarity , very recent duplications may not all be identified in this process. furthermore, since the species used in this study differ by greater than 5% , this process would be expected to identify ancestral salmonid duplications occurring at or prior to the rainbow trout and atlantic salmon speciation.

determining the number of genes in atlantic salmon from the number of est contigs is difficult for several reasons; 1) the partial representation of genes by est sequences may result in several contigs associated with a single gene transcript, 2) allelic or recently duplicated genes may be represented by similar but unique transcripts , 3) alternative splicing, alternative poly adenylation and termination sites from the same gene can result in different transcripts, and 4) transcription products can occur from intergenic regions. an estimation of the number of genes in salmonids will require additional information such as full-length cdna sequences and gene mapping information.

salmonid comparisons
similarity among the different salmonid species was assessed using the top blastn hit against atlantic salmon and rainbow trout est contig databases. the similarity values from chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, rainbow trout, atlantic salmon , brook trout, grayling, lake whitefish, northern pike and rainbow smelt are shown in table  <dig>  assembled contigs , rather than individual reads were used for all comparisons to reduce the impact of redundant transcripts. chinook, sockeye, brook trout, grayling and lake whitefish average  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % identity to rainbow trout, and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % identity to atlantic salmon with over 87% of the contigs matching  at least one contig in the rainbow trout or atlantic salmon databases. these comparisons provide only a very general indication of the similarity between transcriptomes of various salmonids, as assemblies contain both 5'  and 3'  transcript reads. however, these dna sequence similarity values correspond well to the limited number of values in the literature. non-coding sequence similarity between rainbow trout and atlantic salmon are 95% over  <dig> kb in mh class ia and b loci  <cit> , and 93–97% over  <dig> kb in growth hormone  genes  <cit> . similarity between salmon and whitefish is 90–93% in gh genes  <cit> .

northern pike and rainbow smelt average  <dig>  and  <dig> % identity to rainbow trout and  <dig>  and  <dig> % identity to atlantic salmon, but only 25–39% of these contigs matched anything in the rainbow trout or atlantic salmon database. these latter comparisons have many fewer significant similarities identified partly because of the much older divergence times  <cit> . however, the reason for the lower than expected number of matches between northern pike and rainbow trout or atlantic salmon is not clear. while the more distantly related rainbow smelt contigs show similar numbers of blastx hits to protein databases as salmonids, the northern pike contigs showed very few similarities to atlantic salmon and rainbow trout contigs  and very few blastx hits to protein databases . one possible explanation may be due to longer 3'-utrs in northern pike, but this remains to be confirmed.

transcriptome representation
it is difficult to assess how comprehensive the extensive atlantic salmon and rainbow trout est databases are. however, 73%  of all rainbow trout contigs are also found in atlantic salmon. moreover, only 28% of those transcripts unique to rainbow trout  have protein hits  that support their legitimacy as genic regions, while other single ests may be from spurious transcription. 91% of lake whitefish transcripts have a significant similarity  to the atlantic salmon or rainbow trout databases. comparative data from chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, brook trout, grayling, lake whitefish and rainbow smelt are provided in table  <dig>  overall, these data provide support for extensive gene coverage in salmonid est databases.

full-length analysis
the rapid progress of est sequencing has enabled an estimation of the number of full-length cdna clones. full-length cdnas  are defined as having a "start – open reading frame  – stop – 3' utr – polya signal" with the orf corresponding to a full-length protein. given multiple start and stop sites, alternative splicing and partial homologies to known proteins, it is difficult to give precise numbers of completed fl-cdnas. however, targetidentifier  identifies  <dig>  possible fl-cdnas  from the  <dig>  possible transcripts in atlantic salmon and  <dig>  fl-cdnas from the  <dig>  rainbow trout transcripts. thus far, about half of the predicted fl-cdna meet all of the criteria above, and many of the fl-cdnas are already fully characterized on a single clone. these tend to be the shorter  genes. the list of over  <dig>  putative fl-cdna transcripts assembled from ests is available at the grasp website  <cit>  and further identification of clones for complete sequence analysis is underway.

salmonid est, assembly, orf and annotation database
all ests have been deposited in genbank, however the est assemblies themselves and the resulting consensus sequences are also very useful in identifying genes. these assemblies, together with the raw data are available  <cit> . the assembly consensus sequences are available for download and for searching using blast tools. a contig visualization tool was developed to allow users to search for similar consensus sequences using blast searches, identifying consensus names and then visualizing the sequences, alignment, open-reading frames , targetidentifier predictions, and blastx hits in a single view . until such time as the genomes are completed, this database provides the salmonid community with access to several levels of est and gene analyses.

salmonid phylogeny and gene duplication
the relationships among major groups of salmonids have been largely unresolved, particularly with respect to the placement of salvelinus , oncorhynchus  and salmo  within salmoninae, and the placement of thymallinae , coregoninae  and salmoninae  within salmonidae  <cit> . from the est contigs ,  <dig> separate gene sets have been identified, each of which contained at least one est contig sequence from each of five major salmonid genera , in addition to representation by a non-salmonid . contig sequences within each gene set were aligned, trimmed to a common length  and analyzed using phylogenetic methods.  <dig> of the  <dig> gene sets could be identified by blastx searches to swissprot databases . for each gene set, a 70% neighbour-joining  consensus tree based on  <dig> bootstrap replicates was generated and the consensus tree rooted with osmerus mordax sequences . the single species tree shown in figure  <dig> represents a compilation of the phylogenetic results from  <dig> gene sets. in the summary tree, each branch is noted by; i) the number of 70% consensus nj trees supporting the branch ii) the number of 70% consensus trees providing no resolution to the branch point, and iii) the number of consensus trees that conflict with the shown result. in this summary, the placement of salmo as a sister group to oncorhynchus and salvelinus is supported in  <dig> of the  <dig> gene consensus trees for which resolution was found. eight alternative consensus trees support grouping salmo and salvelinus, one consensus tree supports grouping salmo and oncorhychus, and the remaining  <dig> trees provide no resolution. thus the overall result is in agreement with some of the more recent studies examining mitochondrial and nine nuclear genes  <cit> , and suggests good support for grouping oncorhynchus and salvelinus apart from salmo within the salmoninae subfamily.

* listed is the gene set identifier  along with the number of contigs used in each data set, the length of the respective nucleotide alignment , and tentative identification based on blastx hits to the swissprot database . for each gene set, the tree support for the various arrangements is listed; for example, om/sf supports an oncorhynchus mykiss/salvelinus fontinalis grouping; or s/c supports a salmoninae/coregoninae grouping. in addition there is an indication whether a tree is consistent  with an ancestral salmonidae gene duplication. "-" indicates that the data provides no clear evidence for any particular tree. all est accession numbers used to make contig consensus sequences, all alignments and the 70% consensus trees are available  or online at the grasp website  <cit> .

consistent with traditional nomenclature, the salmoninae group, which includes salvelinus, oncorhynchus and salmo is also very well supported with  <dig> of the  <dig> resolved trees consistent with this grouping. the three discrepant trees supported a salmo/coregonus grouping.

the relationships among the three subfamilies within salmonidae have not been extensively addressed at the molecular level. however, on the basis of a morphological analysis, coregoninae  has been hypothesized as the earliest branch within the salmonids . in the present analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> informative gene sets are more consistent with the basal position of thymallinae . of the discrepant trees,  <dig> sets support a thymallinae/coregoninae grouping and  <dig> support an ancestral position of coregoninae. while these data are not definitive, there appears to be some support for an ancestral thymallinae branching within the salmonidae with coregoninae as the sister group to salmoninae. these data provide the first large-scale molecular view of salmonid subfamily relationships and provide an important perspective on future analyses of duplicated genes, as well as physiological and ecological traits  <cit>  that have evolved subsequent to the ancestral salmonid genome duplication.

the salmonid whole genome duplication hypothesis makes it is difficult to separate an analysis of species relationships from gene phylogeny. one expectation arising from a relatively recent genome duplication is evidence for extensive nuclear gene duplicates. subsequent to the genome duplication, the number of observed duplicated transcribed genes is expected to decrease as, over time, one of the duplicates becomes transcriptionally inactive. when multiple species are examined, some species may have both duplication products while other species may have only one representative. evidence of an ancestral duplication is identified in gene trees that contain multiple species trees that may have missing representatives. of the  <dig> gene sets examined in this study,  <dig> show clear evidence of multiple species trees within gene trees that are consistent with a gene duplication in the ancestor of salmonidae, sometime after the separation of osmeriformes and salmoniformes fish.  <dig> gene sets  provided no evidence for any ancestral gene duplication, and  <dig> sets could not be interpreted. the data from  <dig> gene sets representing  <dig> consensus sequences and  <dig>  bp of aligned dna from five salmonid genera, indicate that a large number of salmonid genes show evidence of extensive gene duplication at a phylogenetic position that is consistent with the whole genome duplication in the ancestral salmonidae hypothesis. further studies of esociformes fish will more precisely establish the timing of some of these gene duplications.

salmonid  <dig> k microarray
to use the data generated by ests and assemblies for examining gene expression, a new  <dig>  feature cdna microarray was developed. this new array is based on the existing  <dig> k grasp array  <cit>  plus  <dig>  additional atlantic salmon and  <dig>  additional rainbow trout contigs that were identified as unique and were successfully amplified in this study. the  <dig> k cdna microarray is composed mainly of  <dig>  atlantic salmon  and  <dig>  rainbow trout  cdna elements or features. 54% of the elements have fairly stringent  hits to annotated members in public protein databases. hybridization performance of this array was evaluated using atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, coho salmon, brook trout and lake whitefish rna obtained from liver organs. the success of hybridization of labeled target to the salmonid elements was judged by the numbers of atlantic salmon and rainbow trout elements passing background plus  <dig> sd threshold values . no transformations or normalizations were performed on the data. overall statistics are presented in table  <dig>  in summary, for rna isolated from the liver of atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, coho salmon, brook trout and lake whitefish, an average of 48% of the  <dig>  elements showed significant detection levels of expression. comparing these results to that from the previous  <dig> k grasp arrays indicates that doubling the number of elements from  <dig> k to  <dig> k resulted in the ability to assess expression patterns of approximately 61% additional transcripts. this represents a substantial increase in our ability to assess gene transcription patterns in salmonids. the hybridization performances of the different salmonid species  conformed to expectations, given the close evolutionary relationships of the species tested  and, with the possible exception of brook trout, all members of the family salmonidae tested showed similar levels of hybridization to the atlantic salmon and rainbow trout elements on the  <dig> k microarray. as the salmonidae family represents  <dig> closely related species, the  <dig> k cdna array provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate gene expression patterns of a large group of culturally and economically important species.

CONCLUSIONS
atlantic salmon and rainbow trout now rank 19th and 29th in terms of species representation in est databases with over  <dig>  salmonid ests in total. almost half of these data are presented in this study. these data provide an excellent genetic resource for physiological, ecological, biochemical, behavioral, disease and biological studies of salmonids. they also provide key materials for the development of polymorphic markers for genetic and physical genomics maps, for the identification and analysis of proteins and for the development of microarrays and primers for transcriptional analyses.

transcript assemblies and analyses have identified over  <dig>  possible transcripts from atlantic salmon and  <dig>  transcripts from rainbow trout. these assemblies and consensus sequences are available from the author or through a database housed on the grasp website  <cit> . as many as  <dig>  full-length salmo salar gene assemblies are present in this database.

comparison of orthologous ests from atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, brook trout, lake whitefish, grayling, northern pike and rainbow smelt show that pacific salmon , atlantic salmon  and brook trout  average 94–96% similarity. lake whitefish  and grayling  are more distant from pacific and atlantic salmon , followed by northern pike  and rainbow smelt . a view of salmonid relationships and support for the salmonid genome duplication has been found. with the new est database, a new, more extensive  <dig> k cdna microarray has been developed to help assess gene expression patterns in salmonids.
