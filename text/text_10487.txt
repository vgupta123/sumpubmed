BACKGROUND
the most significant difference between humans and non-human primates is the highly developed cognitive ability in humans. though many efforts have been made to delineate the genetic basis of the cognitive difference, it remains unclear. because of the great similarity of genome sequences between humans and non-human primates  <cit> , more and more studies have started to look at gene regulation differences in the brain  <cit> , which are thought to be much more important for human brain evolution. as epigenetic modifications play important roles in learning and memory  <cit> , it is possible that epigenetic modifications have contributed to human brain evolution. however, this has rarely been addressed.

comparison of dna methylation between humans and non-human primates at the orthologous regions in the genome could be an informative attempt to reveal the evolutionary roles of dna methylation in human brain evolution. two small-scale studies that compared dna methylation of brain between humans and non-human primates have been conducted. it was reported that dna methylation differences between human and chimpanzee were predominantly observed in the brain  <cit> . another study reported a species-specific methylated region in an alu-sg <dig> repeat  <cit> . recently, several large-scale studies of dna methylation comparison between humans and non-human primates in multiple tissues  and cell lines have also been conducted, and the differentially methylated regions were identified mostly in repeats and cpg islands  <cit> . but the situation of dna methylation in the brain, which is intuitively more important for primates, is largely unknown.

we aim to identify genes that show differential dna methylation levels in the prefrontal cortex  between humans and non-human primates. we first conducted a genome-wide methylation scan using the medip-chip technology, and then the candidate regions were subject to the analysis using sequenom massarray  <cit>  for confirmation and further validation using independent samples. finally, we identified four regions/genes differentially methylated between humans and rhesus macaques in pfc. two genes have neural related functions. the phylogenetic comparison among human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque and rat suggested that a dmr in the promoter of k6irs <dig> was hypomethylated specifically in the human brain, not the other species.

RESULTS
general profile of genome-wide dna methylation
firstly, three adult human and three age/sex matched rhesus macaque  pfc samples were subjected to the medip-chip analysis to obtain the genome-wide dna methylation data. for rhesus macaques, the species-specific arrays were designed and used .

for the medip-chip data, we first tested the correlation between cpg content and dna methylation level. for each  <dig>  bp promoter region, we only used the 540bp window closest to the transcription start site, and we observed a significant negative correlation  . this is consistent with previous studies showing that in mammalian species, cpg islands, which have higher cpgo/e, usually have lower methylation levels  <cit> .

we then tested if the dna methylation level was negatively correlated with gene expression using the published gene expression data  <cit> . as the coverage of the expression data of rhesus macaques was not high enough, we only tested the correlation in humans. we used a  <dig> bp sliding window to access the correlations between gene expression and the methylation levels of different locations of the  <dig> bp promoter regions. as shown in additional file  <dig> , all the five sliding windows showed significant negative correlation. interestingly, the region of -40bp-500bp showed a non-monotonic relationship, which is consistent with the recent finding that the gene-body methylation has a non-monotonic relationship with gene expression  <cit> .

identification of candidate regions showing differential dna methylation
to check the quality of the medip-chip data, we randomly selected  <dig> regions with different dna methylation levels and cpg contents and conducted bisulfite sequencing. the result showed that there was a good correlation between the medip-chip data and the bisulfite sequencing data  , indicating that the medip-chip data was informative and relatively reliable as a preliminary screening.

to identify the candidate differentially methylated regions between humans and rhesus macaques, we used two different methods to analyze the medip-chip data: the nimblescan and the batman methods  <cit> . the regions that were estimated having differential dna methylation levels by both methods were selected as the candidate regions for further analysis. around 42% of the peaks identified by nimblescan  were confirmed by batman . as a preliminary screening step, we used a nominal p value cutoff of  <dig>  to select the candidate regions. totally, we obtained  <dig> candidate dmrs , and most of them were located  in the cpg islands  based on the ucsc genome annotation . this is consistent with the features of the medip-chip technology, which tends to find cpg methylation in the high cpg density regions  <cit> . gene ontology  analysis for the  <dig> candidate dmrs was conducted using david <cit> , however, no enrichment was observed.

it has been suggested that there is a high false discovery rate for the medip-chip method  <cit> . and even the dmrs identified between two human embryonic stem cell lines using the more advanced medip-seq technique do not have good validation  <cit> . hence, the  <dig> candidate dmrs need to be further tested by independent methods.

validation of the candidate dmrs using massarray
for the  <dig> candidate regions likely having differential dna methylation levels between humans and rhesus macaques, we conducted further analysis in the same samples  using the sequenom massarray method  <cit> , which has much higher resolution and accuracy for dna methylation compared to the medip-chip method and is suitable for candidate gene validation. among the  <dig> candidate dmrs, a total of  <dig> dmrs were successfully amplified and obtained eligible data for more than one sample in both species. it should be noted that for the massarray method, the minimum measuring unit was cpg unit, which are one or several consecutive cpg sites. a total of  <dig> eligible cpg units were obtained for the  <dig> dmrs, and  <dig> of them can be paired based on their orthology between humans and rhesus macaques. the other  <dig> eligible cpg units could not be paired, therefore, were excluded from further analyses.

for each of the  <dig> candidate dmrs, the average methylation level of each region was calculated and compared between humans and rhesus macaques. two criteria were used to determine the validated dmrs:  the differences of the average methylation levels between the two species should be larger than  <dig>  as reported previously in order to reduce false discovery  <cit> ;  the p value adjusted by benjamini fdr should be less than  <dig> . using these statistical criteria followed by bisulfite sequencing , we identified a total of  <dig> dmrs . the directions  of the differences between humans and rhesus macaques for all  <dig> dmrs were the same as that of the medip-chip results, suggesting that the initial screening using medip-chip was effective though not accurate. notably, since we used relatively loose criteria to select the candidate dmrs from the medip-chip data in order to cover more potentially differentially methylated regions. thus, it was not surprising that only a small part of the  <dig> candidate dmrs were validated by the massarray analysis.

features and functional implication of the dmrs
for the  <dig> dmrs, dmr <dig> is located in the promoter of rnf32; dmr <dig> covers the promoter and the first exon of k6irs2; dmr <dig> covers the first exon and extends to the first intron of icam <dig>  and dmr <dig> is located in the first exon of prosapip <dig>  based on the ucsc human genome annotation, dmr <dig> is entirely located in the cpg island; dmr <dig> and dmr <dig> have more than half of their full length located in the cpg islands, and dmr <dig> is located  <dig> bp from the nearest cpg island.

we then checked if there were any repeat elements in the dmrs. we found nearly all the  <dig> dmrs had no repeat element, because we removed the non-unique probes of medip-chip array, which would remove most of probes targeted to repeat elements. however, there was an exception in rhesus macaques where we found a mir <dig> repeat element that was entirely located in dmr <dig>  based on the ucsc genome annotation.

to look into the potential functional significance of the differentially methylated regions and its implications for human evolution, we conducted functional annotation for the four genes located in the 4dmrs. interestingly, two genes are involved in neural functions. icam <dig>  is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and has been reported associated with schizophrenia  <cit>  and alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . prosapip <dig> is a synaptic protein that interacts with the pdz domain of prosap2/shank <dig> <cit> . for the other two genes, k6irs <dig> encodes a type ii keratin that is expressed in the inner root sheath of hair follicles  <cit> , and the function of k6irs <dig> is not known. rnf <dig> is a ring finger protein, and its function is unknown.

next, we addressed the functional conservation of the  <dig> dmrs genes, and we studied their protein conservation using human versus rhesus macaque dn/ds ratios . the dn/ds ratios of all  <dig> genes were smaller than one, suggesting functional conservation . these results suggest that the identified dmrs are not likely caused by protein functional divergence between different species.

dna methylation comparison in multiple species
to look into the detailed evolutionary changes of the identified dmrs, using bisulfite sequencing, we measured the dna methylation levels of the  <dig> dmrs in multiple species including human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque and rat. the methylation levels of the orthologous regions of the dmrs were compared in the phylogenetic context with rat as outgroup. interestingly, the four dmrs showed different patterns. for icam <dig>  chimpanzee and rat showed similar methylation levels with humans, while rhesus macaque had a lineage specific increase of methylation level . similar pattern was observed for prosapip <dig> where rhesus macaque had a lineage specific decrease of methylation . for rnf <dig>  the methylation levels were different among human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque and there is no orthologous gene in rat . the most informative case was k61rs <dig>  in which the methylation level in humans showed a lineage-specific decrease  , suggesting a human-specific methylation change during evolution.

discussion
in this study, we employed a two-step method to identify the differentially methylated regions and  <dig> regions were found to have different methylation levels in pfc between humans and rhesus macaques, which are informative candidates for further study of human brain evolution. however, there are also methodological limitations. the  <dig> candidate regions are all high cpg content regions because the nimblegen method tends to find highly methylated regions with high cpg content. it was reported that high cpg content regions were of higher quality in medip-chip data  <cit> . in studies of tissue specific dna methylation regions, high cpg content regions such as the cpg islands showed less between individual variance and less differences between different tissues  <cit> , and this may be the same case between different species. though we cannot exclude the possibility that there are differentially methylated regions in low cpg content regions, the high cpg content regions, on which we focused in this study, are more likely to be functionally important  <cit>  and more likely to have definite between-species differences and less within-species variations, thus evolutionarily more significant. in addition, considering the multiple data filtering steps using different methods, the number of identified dmrs in this study was likely an underestimation of the between-species methylation divergence in the brain.

repeat elements are important in dna methylation. farcas et al. <cit>  reported a small region of alu-sg <dig> element that was differentially methylated between human and chimpanzee cerebral cortex. in this study, we found another case of sine element differentially methylated between humans and rhesus macaques, implying the roles of repeat elements in the epigenetic evolution of primates. in the rhesus macaque genome, the mir <dig> element located in dmr <dig> has a length of  <dig> bp and divergence of  <dig> % to its consensus sequence. in dmr <dig>  the human ortholog of this region have  <dig> substitutions and  <dig> deletion compared with rhesus macaque, and it is not annotated as repeat region by ucsc. mir <dig> belongs to the mir  family, which is one of the oldest trna-derived sine  elements, and they integrated into the host genomes before the radiation of mammals  <cit> . in dmr <dig>  three cpg sites  of rhesus macaques are located in mir <dig>  interestingly, the three cpg sites are the only cpg sites that showed significant methylation differences between humans and rhesus macaques , suggesting that the mir <dig> element has led to the differential methylation of dmr <dig> between humans and rhesus macaques.

among the  <dig> validated dmrs, only one is located in the repeat region, suggesting that the differentially methylated regions between humans and nonhuman primates are not necessarily restricted to repeat regions and can be high cpg content regions, which have been previously thought to be less variable  <cit> .

as dna methylation in the promoter regions will repress gene expression, it would be informative to see whether the differential dna methylations between humans and rhesus macaques would lead to expression differences. we analyzed the published gene expression data from human and rhesus macaque cerebral cortices  <cit> . among the four dmrs identified in our study, two dmr related genes  had eligible expression data and showed significant gene expression differences between human and rhesus macaque . however, for both genes, the species having higher dna methylation levels also showed higher gene expression levels, which is inconsistent with the expected repression of gene expression by a higher level of dna methylation in the promoter. however, these two dmrs also covered the first exons of the corresponding genes, and the gene-body methylation was reported to be positively correlated with gene expression in human cells  <cit> . hence, detailed analysis in the future is needed to reveal the influence of dmrs on gene expression.

it is difficult to address how the observed methylation differences have been formed during primate evolution. trans-generational inheritance is crucial if epigenetic modification should play a role in evolution. many studies have reported that epigenetic modifications can be inherited across generations  <cit> . but the inheritance of dna methylation is not as stable as that of dna sequence and the mechanisms underlying the trans-generational inheritance of epigenetic modification are not well understood.

recently, it was reported that dna methylation is correlated with dna sequence variations  <cit>  and non-coding rnas  <cit> , and these correlations might act as an indirect mechanism that explains the trans-generational inheritance of epigenetic modification. the dna sequence substitutions during evolution may cause the emergence of new cpg sites and/or loss of the existing cpg sites, eventually leading to methylation divergence of specific genomic regions. it has been reported that the cpg-snps in the human genome have contributions to allele specific dna methylation  <cit> , implying that even at the population level, the methylation divergence can occur due to dna sequence polymorphisms. alternatively, dna sequence differences could also result from dna methylation differences between species  <cit> .

another possibility is that epigenetic modifications altered by environment can be transmitted to the next generation directly. global epigenetic reprogramming including demethylation of dna occurs in the mammalian primordial germ cells and in early embryos  <cit> . although global epigenetic reprogramming will restrict the trans-generational epigenetic inheritance, the erasure of dna methylation modifications is not absolute  <cit> , suggesting the possibility of direct transmitting of dna methylation modifications to the next generation. additionally, at the whole genome level, the over-all similar dna methylation patterns between humans and macaques cannot be explained by the similarity of living environment because they inhabit totally different environments, suggesting potentially vertical inheritance of methylation.

a lot of candidate dmrs obtained from the medip-chip analysis were not validated by massarray and bisulfite sequencing. this discrepancy could be explained by two possible sources. first, for medip-chip analysis, we used different arrays for humans and rhesus macaques. even though the validation for each species-specific array is good, the technical bias may still exist, as the array for rhesus macaques has not been rigorously tested. second, besides detecting the genome-wide dna methylation patterns, we focused on identifying differentially methylated regions between humans and non-human primates. thus, a relaxed cut-off  was applied for selecting the  <dig> candidates from the medip-chip data, likely resulting in a relatively high number of false-positives.

CONCLUSIONS
our study is the first large-scale comparison of dna methylation between human and non-human primates in the brain. we found several regions of lineage specific dna methylation, indicating that dna methylation plays potential roles in brain evolution, and the regions we reported are good candidates for further functional studies, and will shed light on the study of human brain evolution. the results suggest that the patterns of dna methylation in the brain are in general similar between humans and non-human primates.
