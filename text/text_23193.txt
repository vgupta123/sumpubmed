BACKGROUND
a systems-level understanding of organisms is not feasible by studying the functions of individual genes or proteins using reductionist approaches. it requires describing all molecular-level components that constitute building blocks of the system, identifying interactions among these components and determining regulatory modules to model emergent behavior  <cit> . as such, identifying all functional elements including genes, rna, and proteins is a prerequisite to generating predictive models of biological response to biotic or abiotic perturbations. the genome sequence encodes all the necessary information required to decipher its functions. therefore, genome sequencing, with concomitant structural annotation, i.e., identification of the functional elements within the genome, including genes, gene structures, open reading frames and regulatory motifs, is a critical step for conducting systems biology research. it is imperative that current and up-to-date knowledge of molecular level components exists for a genome sequence. therefore, re-annotation is key to identifying these fundamental components of biological processes.

de novo assembly of a genome is followed by mapping of functional elements using computational methods. computational methods for prokaryotic gene annotation such as gene locator and interpolated markov modeler   <cit>  and genemark.hmm  <cit>  use hidden markov models  <cit>  based on a sequence similarity measure generated from previously annotated genomes. these algorithms do not accurately identify all genes in the genome and sometimes result in errors, especially in positioning of translational start codons  <cit>  and in the identification of small protein coding genes. another major problem with computational approaches is over-annotation, which arises from the failure to discriminate between random open reading frames and those that are translated. computational prediction of small non-coding rna , which lack sequence conservation in closely related species, has limited accuracy since transcriptional signal prediction  is also not accurate. therefore, srna that regulate many biological processes, including virulence in bacterial pathogens, cannot be identified by computational approaches alone.

experimental identification of expressed regions in the genome can help overcome some of the drawbacks of computational methods and is a complementary approach to computational genome annotation methods. dna microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression  or high throughput transcriptome sequencing technologies such as rna-seq, can all be used to measure genome expression  <cit> . of these methods, rna-seq, which generates a single nucleotide resolution map of the transcriptome, can help annotate mrna, non-coding rna and srna, transcriptional structure of genes, and post-transcriptional modifications induced by alternate splicing in eukaryotes  <cit> .

in this study, we report re-annotation of m. haemolytica, a gram-negative bacterial pathogen and one of the causative agents of bovine respiratory disease  in cattle. brd is responsible for over $ <dig> billion in losses to the cattle industry every year  <cit> . m. haemolytica is most commonly isolated in field cases of brd  <cit>  and is considered to be the primary pathogen for this disease. due to its importance for disease etiology, the genome of a bovine strain of m. haemolytica was sequenced in  <dig>  however, to date, the  <dig>  mb m. haemolytica phl <dig> genome sequenced with an  <dig> × coverage, is still in its draft phase. despite being sequenced  <dig> years ago, the m. haemolytica genome sequence has not seen any improvement in its quality. therefore, we chose to conduct rna-seq based re-annotation of m.haemolytica. the single nucleotide resolution map generated helped identify novel protein coding regions, srna, correct annotation errors, and operon structures.

materials and methods
rna isolation
m. haemolytica phl <dig> was cultured in brain heart infusion  to mid-log phase . cells from a single culture were treated with rnaprotect reagent  and stored at -80°c for subsequent rna isolation. total rna from this single culture was extracted using the rneasy mini kit , following manufacturer's protocols. it is to be noted that this kit allows for the extraction of transcripts that are at least  <dig> nucleotides and larger. rna preparations were treated with rnase-free dnase  and the integrity of the rna was determined using bioanalyzer  <dig> . rna sample with rna integrity number  of  <dig> was used for the rna-seq experiment. from total rna, mrna was enriched by removing the rrnas using microbexpress™ kit . this enrichment step specifically removes large rrnas; small rnas  are not removed. in the first step of the microbexpress™ kit procedure, total rna was mixed with an optimized set of capture oligonucleotides that bind to the bacterial 16s and 23s rrnas. next, the rrna hybrids were removed from the solution using derivatized magnetic microbeads. the mrna remained in the supernatant and was recovered by ethanol precipitation and quantified by bioanalyzer  <dig>  our rna preparation did not include entities <  <dig> nucleotides in length.

rna-seq
a cdna library was constructed using the illumina mrna-seq sample prep kit  with  <dig> ng rna enriched for mrna isolated from a single in vitro culture, following manufacturer's instructions. mrna was chemically fragmented and randomly primed for reverse transcription and second-strand synthesis. the resulting cdna was end-repaired and 'a' overhangs were added. illumina paired-end sequence adaptors were ligated to the cdna fragments. fragments of approximately  <dig> bp were isolated from a 2% agarose gel and amplified  according to the illumina protocol. bioanalyzer  <dig>  was used to quantify and confirm the fragment size of each library.  <dig> nm of mrna-seq library sample prepared for sequencing on the illumina gaii  was denatured and diluted to  <dig> pm for clustering  according to the manufacturer's protocol. single read sequencing of the clustered flow cell was performed using illumina's sbs chemistry  and scs data analysis pipeline v <dig> . flow-cell image analysis and cluster intensity calculations were carried out by illumina real time analysis  software. subsequent base-calling was performed using the illumina ga pipeline v <dig> . <dig> software. the resulting illumina reads were quality-filtered by removing reads containing ns.

alignment
the sequencing experiment produced  <dig> , <dig> reads. fastq reads generated by illumina were converted to sanger fastq format using perl scripts from the mapping and assembly with qualities  software package  <cit> . reads  were mapped to the  <dig>  mb m. haemolytica phl <dig>  reference genome using bowtie  <cit> . the parameters in bowtie that control the speed and sensitivity were adjusted as follows: reads with no more than  <dig> mismatches per read  were aligned, and any reads mapped to more than one location across the genome  were discarded . post alignment, a human-readable sequence alignment/map  format file was converted to a "pileup" format file using samtools  <cit> . this pileup file contains the count of reads per base aligned to each location across the length of the genome. the sam file was also converted into a binary alignment/map  format. these bam formatted files are necessary for visualization of read alignments in artemis viewer. the artemis browser enabled the visual/manual inspection of alignment results in the context of the existing genome annotation. the pileup file, in conjunction with the annotation information of m. haemolytica phl <dig>  was processed using in-house perl  <cit>  scripts. data generated from the rna-seq experiment was submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive  as reads in fastq format  and the .bam alignment file  generated by aligning the reads to the reference genome.

analysis of expressed intergenic regions
identifying expressed regions within the genome that have not been previously annotated will improve the existing structural annotation of the m. haemolytica phl <dig>  prior to the analysis of expressed regions in the genome, we determined the signal to noise ratio cutoff for background expression using the pileup file. coverage depth  greater than the lower tenth percentile of all reads was considered to be expressed and in this dataset, this corresponded to  <dig> reads/base  <cit> . based on this read/base cutoff, expressed intergenic regions  were identified by applying an additional length cutoff of  <dig> bp. shorter regions  were discarded to reduce the number of false positives. custom perl scripts were written to parse the pileup file and the existing genome structural annotation to identify  expressed annotated regions,  expressed regions previously not annotated and,  regions that are annotated but are not expressed. all eirs were further analyzed using blastx  <cit>  searches to determine their protein coding potential. if an eir was found to be a perfect match  for a protein, it was classified as a putative novel protein coding region. all eirs with partial blastx hits were evaluated for the presence of an alternate start site or mutation in the start or stop codon associated with the annotated region. if the blastx search revealed a frameshift mutation, the eir and the gene associated with the frameshift mutation were classified as a frameshift. eirs with poor blastx hits and without any association to genes containing annotation errors were excluded from further analysis. eirs without blastx hits were considered to be potential small non-coding rna.

the prokaryotic promoter prediction  program  <cit>   and transterm hp  <cit>  were used to predict promoters and rho-independent terminators, respectively, in the forward and reverse strands of the m. haemolytica phl <dig> genome. the locations of promoters and terminators were organized into .gff files. a perl script was written to identify putative srna i.e. eirs with promoters or terminators associated to their loci. eirs with no computationally-predicted promoters or rho-independent terminators were searched against the rfam database  <cit>  to determine whether these sequences were annotated in rfam. eirs that could not be classified as srna by rfam were excluded from further analysis.

analysis of expressed annotated regions
using the annotation information  of m. haemolytica phl <dig> and the pileup file, all annotated regions that were expressed above the background signal to noise ratio cutoff with at least 60% coverage were considered to be expressed, which accounts for uniform evaluation of varying gene lengths. similar measures have been used in other transcriptome profiling studies  <cit> . annotated regions below 60% coverage were considered as 'not expressed' under the current experimental conditions. after having identified expressed genes, operon structures within the genome were also defined. the first step towards identifying an operon was to identify co-expressed pairs of coding regions. two regions were considered to be co-expressed when they were identified as expressed on the same strand  and the region between them was also expressed. after such co-expressed pairs were identified, they were extended to construct operons by including additional co-expressed pairs in the vicinity satisfying the same conditions for co-expression as described earlier. operon structures identified by rna-seq were compared to the computationally-predicted operon structures described by the database for prokaryotic operons   <cit>  for cross validation.

RESULTS
read alignment to the m. haemolytica phl <dig> genome
the m. haemolytica phl <dig> is a  <dig>  mb draft genome containing  <dig>  annotated regions of which  <dig>  are protein coding with a 40% g+c content  <cit> . for structural annotation of m. haemolytica at the rna level, the transcriptome of m. haemolytica phl <dig> was sequenced using rna-seq. sequencing-based analysis of the transcriptome overcomes the limitations of the hybridization-based microarray approach. head-on comparison of rna-seq with microarrays has shown that rna-seq has negligible technical variability  <cit> , making it possible to obtain a reliable estimate of gene expression without replicate analysis. therefore, we applied rna-seq for re-annotation of m. haemolytica and conducted the analysis from a single in vitro experiment. reads with an average length of  <dig> bp generated on the illumina platform were mapped onto the reference genome using the bowtie read alignment program. bowtie is an ultrafast, memory efficient alignment program that uses the burrows-wheeler transform  <cit>  with a novel quality backtracking algorithm that permits mismatches. bowtie performs better than short oligonucleotide analysis package   <cit>  and maq, and its sensitivity at aligning reads is as good as both soap and maq. of the  <dig> , <dig> reads generated by illumina,  <dig> , <dig> reads  that mapped uniquely to the genome were used for downstream analysis.  <dig> , <dig> reads  failed to align due to mismatches. the remaining  <dig> , <dig> reads , which mapped to more than one location in the genome , were excluded from analysis. for annotation purposes, reads that map to unique locations alone are used  <cit> . the cutoff value for true-positive expression of a coding region of  <dig> reads/base was calculated from the expression  in the tenth percentile of all reads  <cit> , as we did earlier for rna-seq based re-annotation of another brd pathogen histophilus somni  <cit> .

expressed intergenic regions
we used the existing annotation of open reading frames in m.haemolytica phl <dig> i.e., locus of each gene in the genome and reads identified as expressed by rna-seq, to identify expressed intergenic regions . we identified  <dig> eirs, previously un-annotated as expressed, of a minimum length of  <dig> bp. each eir was further characterized by adding computationally-predicted promoter and rho-independent terminators. prokaryotic promoter prediction  identified  <dig>  promoter regions and transterm hp identified  <dig>  rho-independent terminator regions, in forward and reverse strands of the genome. identified eirs, in conjunction with existing gene annotation information and loci of regulatory signals, were subjected to the analysis workflow described in figure  <dig> 

artemis is a genome browser and annotation tool that allows visualization of sequence features, next generation sequencing data, and the results of the analyses within the context of the genome sequence  <cit> . the artemis genome browser illustrates all the six reading frames of the genome sequence along with the translated amino acid sequences, start and stop codons, as well open readings frames across the length of genome . we visualized the alignment file generated by bowtie, the gene annotation file, promoter and terminator loci, and eirs in artemis. artemis generated a base coverage graph, giving a pictorial representation of the expression in various regions of the genome.

novel protein coding regions
the protein coding potential of eirs was determined by conducting blastx searches with the translated nucleotide sequence of eirs, against the protein database containing all bacterial species. blastx results showed that  <dig> eirs had full length matches to target sequences, indicating their potential for coding proteins. the artemis browser was used to identify the boundaries of these  <dig> potential novel protein coding regions . these novel protein coding regions had an average g+c content of approximately 46%. the length of these regions was between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. while the rna-seq experiment itself was not strand specific, strand specificity of novel protein coding regions was inferred from the proteins identified as ~100% matches to these eirs in blastx. eir mhp <dig> aligned to pg <dig> protein of lactobacillus crispatus st <dig> while mhp <dig> aligned to serine acetyltransferase of haemophilus influenzae nt <dig>  the rest of the eirs  aligned to proteins classified as hypothetical.

corrections made to the existing genome annotation
artemis genome browser creates open reading frames  of a desired minimum length. it identifies orfs as regions between two consecutive stop codons with the specified minimum length. thus orfs corresponding to eirs can be generated and visualized in this browser. rna-seq based expression in relation to the existing genome annotation, when visualized in artemis, enabled the identification of the actual locus and length for some of the annotated proteins. we identified  <dig> genes with a mutated start codon. this anomaly could be the result of computational gene prediction programs identifying the next available "aug" as the start codon . our observation is substantiated by the consecutive expression of an identified eir preceding the 5' region of these genes.  <dig> genes had a mutation that led to the replacement of start codon by a leucine .

since artemis allows marking the start codons within an orf, it is possible to identify alternate start sites, if any, for any orf associated with an eir. orfs created from eirs in artemis revealed possible alternate starts sites for  <dig> genes. blastx searches of the eir and its translated protein revealed that the actual start site varied with respect to previous annotation . where there was a discrepancy between the existing annotation and the current transcriptome based identification of start site, the consensus of start site of similar proteins identified in blastx was used to determine the actual start site. the suggested revisions to existing annotation are in table  <dig> . blastx searches of eirs also revealed mutations that lead to disruption of a protein coding region, resulting in a frameshift . two such eirs which had blastx alignments revealed frameshifts which would otherwise be protein coding regions .

small rna
small rna are known to have regulatory roles in escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholera and many other bacterial pathogens  <cit> . genome-scale identification of srna using rna-seq is reported for e. coli  <cit>  and vibrio cholerae  <cit> , among other pathogenic bacteria. the identification of the loci of srna in the genome is an important pre-requisite for understanding their role in modulating bacterial physiology and virulence  <cit> . srna are synthesized by rna polymerase  in a manner analogous to the synthesis of any rna in bacteria ; srna promoters could be regulated by transcription factors or use of alternative sigma factors  <cit> . therefore, the presence of promoters and terminators for potential srna  <cit>  identified by experimental approaches like rna-seq, increases the confidence in their identification. although the rna extraction protocol used in this study does not facilitate extraction of smaller transcripts and strand specificity is lost during cdna synthesis, we identified potential srna. eirs with no protein coding potential, as observed via blastx searches, were considered to be candidate srna. it is possible that eirs with no blastx matches are non-conserved orfs; since there are no in silico methods to validate this assumption, we chose to consider all eirs with no blastx as candidates for small rna analysis. candidate srna loci were searched for the presence of a promoter or terminator. for  <dig> eirs that had no blastx matches, a promoter or a rho-independent terminator was identified either on the forward or the reverse strand  of their locus. promoters/terminators were present in the transcriptional regulatory regions, i.e., a promoter was present in the - <dig> to - <dig> region or a terminator was present in the + <dig> to + <dig> position at the end of the eir. therefore, we classified the  <dig> candidate srna as potential novel small rna in the m. haemolytica phl <dig> genome . the average length of the identified novel srna was approximately  <dig> bp and ranged between  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the average g+c content of srna was  <dig> %, which is relatively lower than the g+c content of the genome. all identified srna had a promoter associated with their locus and srna mhs <dig> also had an associated terminator. when sequences of the identified srna were searched in the rfam  <cit>  database to identify their function, no matches were found.

gene expression and operons
the m. haemolytica phl <dig> genome consists of  <dig>  annotated genes,  <dig>  of which code for proteins. genes were considered to be expressed if 60% of the gene length had at least  <dig> reads aligned/nucleotide. based on this criteria,  <dig>  of all annotated regions in the genome  were identified as expressed with  <dig> % coverage i.e. approximately 95% of the sequence of the annotated region had at least  <dig> reads aligned/nucleotide. expressed annotated genes and their coverage are documented in additional file  <dig> 

functional analysis of the expressed annotated regions was based on the existing annotation of m. haemolytica genome available at ncbi. it is interesting to note that genes that are described as virulence factors are also expressed under normal culture conditions. for example, genes related to leukotoxin , an important virulence factor, were all expressed. also, the  <dig> capsule forming genes whose role in virulence includes adherence to host and resistance to serum-mediated killing and phagocytosis  <cit>  were all found to be expressed. in addition to these, we also found that  <dig> genes associated with lipopolysaccharide or lipoproteins and contribute to virulence by initiating an inflammatory cytokine response  <cit>  to be expressed. genes responsible for forming the type iv pilus associated with m. haemolytica that is responsible for dna uptake, adhesion, and motility  <cit>  were expressed. filamentous hemagglutinin genes of m. haemolytica , responsible for adhesion to host mucosa  <cit> , were expressed. adhesins play an important role in virulence, and all annotated genes related to this function, such as mha_ <dig>  mha_ <dig>  mha_ <dig>  mha_ <dig>  mha_ <dig>  mha_ <dig> and mha_ <dig>  among others, were all identified as expressed in our experiment. genes responsible for resistance towards antibiotics such as β-lactams, tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfonamides  <cit>  in m. haemolytica were also expressed. annotated regions that were not expressed had coverage of only 30%. of the  <dig> annotated regions that were not expressed  <dig> were annotated as "hypothetical proteins" and  <dig> were "hypothetical bacteriophage proteins."

using expression patterns of coding regions, we identified paired gene expression and operon structures. rna-seq based operon structures were compared to the computationally predicted structures using door  <cit> . we identified  <dig>  co-expressed pairs of genes that could be organized into  <dig> potential operons. door predicted  <dig>  co-expressed pairs forming  <dig> operons . the overlap between rna-seq based and door-based co-expressed pairs was  <dig>  our study identified relatively fewer co-expressed pairs as compared to door. this could be due to the fact that  <dig> of the  <dig>  annotated regions were not expressed in our dataset. furthermore, this method cannot detect genes whose expression is suppressed by polar mutations. the single nucleotide resolution map enabled the identification of co-expressed pairs and definition of operon structures and regulatory patterns. availability of operon structures will facilitate understanding the coordinated regulation of genes in m. haemolytica to moderate metabolic pathways under different environmental conditions.

discussion
identification of all functional elements of the genome is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of biological processes that occur within any living organism. gene models are available for sequenced genomes that are based on computational approaches. however, a number of recent studies highlight the need for genome re-annotation, prior to conducting holistic systems biology analyses. experimental approaches, at times, shed light on regions of the genome where computational methods of structural annotation fail. re-annotation studies of several species including disease causing pathogens have revealed numerous genes, regulatory regions and complex metabolic pathways that remained undetected based on the initial annotation  <cit> . in this study, we applied a combinatorial approach i.e. rna-seq based transcriptome analysis in conjunction with computational resources, to structurally annotate a bacterial genome at the rna level. for the first time, we report rna-seq based annotation of the genome of m. haemolytica phl <dig>  one of the primary pathogens of bovine respiratory disease in cattle  <cit> . its genome was sequenced with  <dig> × coverage, and is in draft phase since  <dig> 

we have recently re-annotated histophilus somni  <dig>  another brd pathogen belonging to pasteurellaceae like m. haemolytica. rna-seq based transcriptome analysis identified  <dig> novel protein coding regions and  <dig> srna in h. somni  <cit> . compared to the draft genome for m. haemolytica, h. somni has a complete genome sequence. yet, re-annotation of this genome identified a number of functional elements missed in the initial annotation. the relatively poor quality of the existing structural annotation of m. haemolytica can be enhanced by re-annotation, and this was the motivation behind the current study.

re-annotation enabled us to fix errors in existing annotation. a mutation that might have occurred during replication could alter the structure of the gene in its vicinity. computational methods, when predicting a gene, seek to identify an orf and its putative start and stop codons to define gene boundaries. mutations in the sequence between the start or stop codon of a gene might not actually affect gene prediction or may sometimes result in a frameshift. if the mutation is to occur in the start or stop codon itself, algorithms would seek to identify the next available start or stop codon. this would lead to alteration in gene locus and a subsequent gene annotation error. such annotation errors cannot be detected without experimental validations. the single nucleotide resolution transcription map generated by rna-seq is one of the most efficient ways to detect such annotation errors. as described in our workflow , once eirs overlapping a certain gene were identified, blastx searches of these regions helped in defining the actual boundaries and correct annotation errors, if any. mutations leading to a frameshift can result in a gene being completely disrupted. such frameshifts remain undetected by automated approaches, but can be identified by experimental approaches such as rna-seq used in this study. genome-wide studies using experimental methods can help validate these predictions and improve the quality of annotation across genomes and eliminate errors from being transferred from one genome to another during annotation of novel assemblies.

understanding coordinated regulation of gene expression in bacteria requires the description of operon structures in the genome. prior to this study, operon structures were unavailable for m. haemolytica. since computationally-predicted operon structures were unavailable, we first generated a set of computationally-predicted operons using door . rna-seq enabled us to identify expressed gene pairs that could be expanded into potential operons. comparison of door predicted operons with rna-seq based operons in m. haemolytica showed a major overlap and cross-validated the findings in both approaches. thus re-annotation helped validate  <dig> operons predicted by door. we also identified  <dig> co-expressed pairs that were not identified by door. since the strand specificity of expression is lost in rna-seq experiment described here, at best the operons identified in this study should be considered 'potential operons' that will require experimental validation in future studies. furthermore, this experiment-based identification of co-expression will not be able to identify genes that are expressed in a polar fashion within the operon. analysis of the functions of genes identified as expressed by rna-seq resulted in an interesting finding. genes that are annotated as being virulence factors were identified as expressed under normal culture conditions. these results are consistent with our findings in h. somni. our results indicate that the expectation of 'virulence factor' being expressed only during pathogenesis may not be accurate. it is possible that there is a basal pervasive level of expression of these factors and that it is the difference in the expression level that actually corresponds to virulence.

computational methods for identification of srna are not accurate, and transcriptome profiling using deep sequencing methods can help identify novel srna. srna play a crucial role in adaptive response to stress by directly or indirectly regulating virulence genes  <cit> , as shown in staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and vibrio cholerae  <cit> . however, a comprehensive understanding of srna regulatory roles during adaptive responses and pathogenesis is only possible after their identification. despite the drawbacks in sample preparation and lack of strand specificity, we identified  <dig> potential novel srna. the identified novel srna were searched for homology in the srna database  against other bacterial srna identified through similar transcriptomics studies and/or computational approaches  <cit> . only  <dig> srna had partial alignments of 20- <dig> nucleotides and the remaining had very poor sequence conservation across the database . we also compared the  <dig> srna identified in the m. haemolytica genome with  <dig> h. somni srna using 'blast  <dig> sequences' megablast  <cit> . no similarity was found, indicating poor consensus among non-coding rna. these results suggest that regulation of srna is probably as diverse and as complex as gene or protein regulation.

the inherent limitations of our experimental setup i.e. lack of enrichment specifically for srna, lack of strand specificity information and lack of biological replicates, isolation of rna at different stages of in vitro growth, etc, did not allow comprehensive identification of srna. due to the same limitations, the identified gene co-expression also needs further validation work in future. however, as the results indicate, application of rna-seq enhanced the existing annotation of m. haemolytica. rna-seq based annotation is not the 'final' and conclusive step in identifying functional elements in this important bacterial pathogen. in fact, this work is part of the continuum in a typical systems biology work flow.

CONCLUSIONS
the rna-seq based transcriptome map of m. haemolytica phl <dig> validated annotated open reading frames and led to the discovery of potential novel protein coding regions. we identified operon structures and were able to fix exiting annotation errors by correcting gene boundaries. the availability of experimentally validated open reading frames, potential novel srna, potential protein coding regions, and operon structures form the basis for future investigations to determine the role of these elements during brd pathogenesis. this study also demonstrates the utility of free and easy to bioinformatics tools for rna-seq data analysis workflow.
