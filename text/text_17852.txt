BACKGROUND
groupers are an economically important aquaculture species in southeast asian countries, with a high market demand in several locales, including hong kong, taiwan, china, mexico, japan, and the usa. however, intensive culture of grouper can result in outbreaks of infectious disease, caused by viral pathogens, such as nodaviruses and iridoviruses, or bacterial pathogens, such as vibrio carchariae and v. alginolyticus <cit> . grouper zygotes develop by 24 h post-fertilization, and their yolk sacs disappear by 72 h. by 10 days, grouper larvae begin to expand their dorsal and ventral fin rays to form an inverted triangle. at this stage, grouper larvae are easily infected by pathogens. after one month, the long fin reaches its full size, and body shape begins to resemble that of the mature grouper  <cit> . the orange-spotted grouper  possesses protogynous hermaphroditic features, and is easier to culture than certain other grouper species, such as epinephelus lanceolatus. furthermore, epinephelus coioides is an excellent source of nutrients; consequently, this species is widely cultured in taiwan. an earlier study reported that expression of c <dig> mrna in epinephelus coioides is influenced by ph and temperature stress, and may play an important role in antioxidation mechanisms  <cit> .

vibrio alginolyticus is a gram-negative bacterial species with a straight rod shape, and is positive for oxidase and catalase. this bacterial species can cause gastroenteritis, with swelling of the intestine. furthermore, it is a potential pathogen of marine fish and shrimp  <cit> . v. alginolyticus strain s3y has been isolated from grouper  larvae with vibriosis in taiwan; this strain is a pathogen of particular concern, as it causes enormous economic losses in the aquaculture industry  <cit> . next-generation high-throughput dna sequencing techniques, including that provided by the illumina genome analyzer, provide high speed and throughput . such techniques can be used to identify and quantify rare transcripts without prior knowledge of gene sequence, and provide information regarding alternative splicing and sequence variation in identified genes; as a result, high-throughput sequencing is more effective at detecting genes than microarrays  <cit> .

in this study, we used high throughput sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes  between normal grouper larvae and larvae with vibriosis. the degs were classified based on their gene ontology  categories and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . furthermore, comparative rt-pcr was used to confirm the observed effects on genes involved in likely pathways affected by infection, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying vibriosis in grouper larvae.

analysis of immune-related signal transduction pathways in infected fish
go  and kegg  analyses of immune factors yielded similar findings; for example, both analyses revealed that complement activation was affected by infection. however, kegg analysis uncovered additional immune responses and clearly disrupted pathways. we thus subsequently focus on the findings of kegg analysis. based on kegg analysis, we selected the following pathways for analysis: complement and coagulation cascades with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> , the staphylococcus aureus infection pathway with a p-value of 1 × 10− <dig> , the phagosome pathway with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> , and the antigen processing and presentation pathway with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> . these pathways are part of the teleost immune response. we combined the staphylococcus aureus infection pathway with the complement and coagulation cascades , and the phagosome pathway with the antigen processing and presentation pathway , designed primers against unigenes involved in these processes based on the transcriptome sequences, and examined rna expression by real-time qpcr, as described below.

analysis of gene expression in the complement-related pathway
as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  we examined the effect of infection on the expression of genes involved in the complement-related pathway by qpcr; the gene names given in the figures are the abbreviations used in kegg. the complement factor b-like  gene was significantly up-regulated between 3 h and 12 h as compared to the control , while the c2r subcomponent-like  gene was significantly down-regulated at 2 h and 3 h . the complement c1q-like protein  <dig>   and complement c1r subcomponent-like   genes were significantly elevated in infected larvae at 8 h and 4 h, respectively. both the haptoglobin-like   and complement component c <dig>   genes were up-regulated between 4 h and 8 h in infected fish. the complement c4-like  gene exhibited an erratic pattern, with up-regulation observed in infected fish at 4 h, 5 h, 7 h, 8 h, and 24 h . the beta-2-glycoprotein  <dig> precursor  gene was also up-regulated at various time points  . expression levels of the complement c <dig>   and complement component c6-like   genes were significantly increased between 8 h and 24 h, and 4 h to 24 h, respectively. levels of the spondin-2-like  gene were significantly increased at 1 h, 5 h, 6 h, and 7 h .the complement component c7-like  gene was significantly elevated between 4 h and 16 h , and the complement component c <dig> beta  gene was up-regulated at 5 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, and 24 h in infected fish . both the complement component c <dig> alpha chain-like   and the complement component c <dig>   genes were significantly increased between 4 h and 24 h. on the other hand, the mannan-binding lectin serine protease  <dig>  gene was significantly down-regulated between 2 h and 4 h . the complement regulatory plasma protein   and complement factor i-like   genes were significantly up-regulated between 5 h and 8 h, and between 2 h and 16 h, respectively. finally, the ca2 + −dependent complex c1r/c1s subunit  gene exhibited both up- and down-regulation, at 1 h and 7 h, respectively . expression levels of alpha-2-macroglobulin-like  , decay accelerating factor  , and minus strand c <dig> inhibitor   were unaffected by infection. certain genes were affected in a time-dependent manner, i.e., bf, c1s, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c8-d, c <dig>  hf, and if.figure  <dig>

analysis of gene expression in the phagocytosis-related pathway
the effect of infection on the expression of genes in the phagocytosis-related pathway was more erratic than that on genes of the complement-related pathway . the protein heg-like   and calnexin-like   genes were significantly up-regulated by infection at 5 h and 7 h, respectively. cathepsin l precursor  gene was up-regulated between 5 h and 7 h , while the lactose-binding lectin l-2-like  gene was up-regulated at 6 h only . expression of the type ii antifreeze protein i  gene was elevated at 24 h and 48 h , that of the early endosome antigen  <dig>  gene at 16 h and 24 h , and that of the cdh1-d  gene at 12 h .the heat shock 70 kda protein 14-like  gene was significantly up-regulated by infection at 6 h , and the invariant chain-like protein  gene at 3 h . the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein  <dig> precursor  gene was up-regulated at both 7 h and 8 h . the beta-centractin-like  gene was also up-regulated at 3 h , while the eosinophil peroxidase-like  gene was down-regulated at 16 h . infection increased expression of the macrophage mannose receptor 1-like  gene between 5 h and 8 h , the tapasin-like  gene at 5 h and 6 h , and the transferrin receptor 1a  gene at 4 h . finally, the tubulin, beta  <dig>  gene was significantly down-regulated at 8 h and 16 h . infection did not affect the expression levels of integrin, alpha v  , integrin beta-3-like  , nattectin  , cytoplasmic dynein  <dig> heavy chain 1-like isoform  <dig>  , beta-centractin-like  , cop <dig> signalosome complex subunit 7a-like  , l-rhamnose-binding lectin csl2-like  , or nuclear transcription factor y subunit alpha-like  genes .figure  <dig>

analysis of antimicrobial peptide gene expression
the innate immune response includes antimicrobial peptides, which can damage bacterial membranes. we identified three antimicrobial peptide genes in the transcriptome library, and analyzed their expression in infected larvae over time . interestingly, expression of the antimicrobial peptide epinecidin- <dig>  which our laboratory previously isolated from epinephelus coioides <cit> , was unaffected . the sequence of epinecidin- <dig> is similar to that of piscidin , and these two peptides were found to have similar effects. however, here we focused on the three antimicrobial peptide genes in our transcriptome database.

the hepcidin-like antimicrobial peptide precursor  gene was significantly up-regulated by infection from 4 h to 8 h , while the liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2-like  was unaffected . conversely, the piscidin-like antimicrobial peptide precursor  gene was significantly down-regulated at 8 h . these findings suggest that epinephelus coioides is dependent on innate immunity to defend against v. alginolyticus infection.figure  <dig>

analysis of the complement- and phagocytosis-related pathways by kegg
as described above, we combined the complement and coagulation cascades with the staphylococcus aureus infection pathway to form the complement-related pathway , and the phagosome pathway with the antigen processing and presentation pathway to form the phagocytosis-related pathway . the complement-related pathway transduces signals to classical pathways, the alternative pathway, and lectin pathway. all complement-related pathways involve cleavage of c <dig> to c3b and then to c <dig>  in order to form a membrane attack complex  for bacterial lysis. the phagocytosis pathway uses nitric oxide synthase to produce no via the phagosome, which then digests the bacterium and presents the antigen fragment, thereby activating mhci and mhcii to stimulate the adaptive immune system.

discussion
here, we describe the use of ngs technology to uncover the response of the transcriptome of epinephelus coioides larvae to infection by v. alginolyticus. few studies have focused on infection of the grouper larvae stage; however, because the long dorsal fin of the larvae stage is yet to completely disappear, it makes fish of this developmental stage prone to getting trapped in nets. furthermore, they are susceptible to dying for many reasons, including changes in water temperature, aeration rate, salinity, and illumination  <cit> . we constructed a transcriptome library from epinephelus coioides larvae, as transcriptome profiling is a powerful method for evaluating the relative importance of gene products in a given tissue  <cit> , and it enabled us to determine the effects of infection on gene expression at the larval stage. we deduced the immune-related signal transduction pathway from kegg enrichment analysis. this pathway was predicted to consist of the complement and coagulation cascades, staphylococcus aureus infection pathway, phagosome pathway, and antigen processing and presentation pathway. the complement system is an ancient mechanism, found in both protostome and invertebrate deuterostome species . like other higher vertebrates, teleost fish contain three complement pathways. earlier studies have demonstrated that the alternative and classical pathways have a significant effect in teleost fish  <cit> . however, very little is known about the molecules involved in the lectin pathway in fish  <cit> . the complement components of fish are different to those of mammals, and some consist of multiple isoforms . the complement pathway is known to be one of the key mechanisms for bacterial clearance in teleost fish  <cit> ; the alternative pathway can be activated by the lipopolysaccharides  of gram-negative bacteria, enabling lysis of the bacterial cell  <cit> . here, we observed that infection had time-dependent effects on several genes related to the complement pathway; however, of the genes of the phagocytosis-related pathway, only the mr and cathepsin genes were affected in a time-dependent manner. the complement factor b-like  gene cleaves c <dig> and acts as a convertase in rainbow trout  <cit> . although the c1r/c1s/masp-like genes of grouper have not been functionally characterized, previous findings suggest that the c1s-like molecule may cleave c <dig> to c4a and c4b fragments in rainbow trout  <cit> .

in teleost fish, c <dig> plays an important role in activation of the classical pathways  <cit> . however, our current results indicate that c <dig> gene expression is not affected in a time-dependent manner by v. alginolyticus infection in grouper larvae. mammalian c <dig> is encoded by a single gene, but almost all teleost fish studied produce multiple forms of c <dig> encoded by different genes  <cit> . in trout, carp, and seabream, these c <dig> isoforms exhibit different binding efficiencies to several active complements; as such, these isoforms may perform separate roles in the destruction of microbes and innate recognition  <cit> . in epinephelus coioides, c <dig> may be inducible and involved in stress responses  <cit> . c <dig> is a part of the membrane attack complex , which cleaves c <dig> into c5a and c5b fragments  <cit> . the c <dig> gene has been partially cloned and purified from trout and seabream  <cit> , and mac has been shown to consist of c5b, c <dig>  c <dig>  and the beta chains of c <dig> and c <dig> in these species  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that complement cofactor protein  regulates both c4b binding protein and factor h  <cit>  in barred sand bass , and two factor i isotypes have been identified in carp  <cit> . based on our results, we hypothesize that v. alginolyticus infection of orange-spotted grouper initially results in the activation of genes such as bf and if, which mediate c <dig> production between  <dig> and 3 h post-infection. c <dig> is then cleaved by c <dig> convertase through the alternative or classical pathway at 4 h . formation of mac occurs between  <dig> and 5 h . finally, mac may clear v. alginolyticus before 48 h.

the phagosome and antigen processing system include phagocytic cells , non-specific cytotoxic cells, and dendritic cells  <cit> . from our gene expression results, it is difficult to determine how infection affects the phagocytosis-related pathway . however, we did observe an increase in macrophage mannose receptor  expression between  <dig> and 8 h, and thus conclude it may be involved in the complement lectin pathway and initiated by the binding of a lectin, such as c-type lectin; it may then activate the complement pathway upon binding of a collectin to a microbial surface  <cit> . the mr may also be involved in the phagocytosis of yeast cells by head-kidney leucocytes in seabream   <cit> . complement component c <dig> has been identified in fertilized cod eggs  <cit> , and phagocytic activity has been detected in zebrafish embryo and 2-day-post-fertilization carp embryo  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
predicted model of the immune response of
epinephelus coioides
larvae to
v. alginolyticus
infection. the times  besides each gene indicate the time post-v. alginolyticus infection at which its expression is significantly increased . the classical pathway involves  cleavage of c <dig> to c <dig> convertase by c1s,  cleavage of c <dig> to c3b by c <dig> convertase,  combination of c3b with c <dig>   cleavage of the resulting complex to c5b by c <dig> convertase, and  formation of the membrane attack complex  and lysis of v. alginolyticus. the lectin pathway involves c-type lectin-mediated cleavage of c <dig> and c <dig> by masp1/ <dig>  and subsequent cleavage of c <dig> by c <dig> convertase. the alternative pathway involves cleavage of c <dig> by factor b; like the classical pathway, factor i acts as an inhibitor in the alternative pathway. hepcidin may directly kill the bacterium by disrupting its membrane.



antimicrobial peptides play important roles in the innate immune response to bacterial infection. antimicrobial peptides range in size from  <dig> amino acid residues for anionic peptides, to as many as  <dig> amino acid residues; larger proteins possess several features of secondary structure, including α -helices, relaxed coils, and antiparallel β-sheet structures. such features are hydrophobic, which enables water-soluble antimicrobial peptides to pass through the membrane lipid bilayer. antimicrobial peptides kill bacteria via one of three mechanisms, known as the barrel-stave model, carpet model, and toroidal model. the barrel-stave model involves aggregation of peptides at the membrane bilayer; the hydrophobic peptide regions align to form a lipid hole like a barrel, disrupting the osmotic balance of the bacterial inner membrane. in the carpet model, the peptides are oriented parallel to the surface of the lipid bilayer, like a carpet. in the toroidal model, the peptides aggregate, and form a pore in the lipid monolayers, and the inserted peptides and the lipid head groups induce a water core line  <cit> .

hepcidin was first identified as a protein involved in innate immunity and iron regulation in the human liver. teleost fish hepcidin has been previously demonstrated to be involved in both iron regulation and immunity. seabream hepcidin is abundant in liver, skin, head-kidney, and peritoneal exudate leucocytes, and flounder hepcidin-like is distributed in liver, esophagus, and cardiac stomach. gene expression is up-regulated by poly i:c, iron dextran, bacteria, or lps  <cit> . in a recent study, a four-cysteine hepcidin isoform gene, ec-hepcidin <dig>  was cloned from epinephelus coioides, and was reported to be effective against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas stutzeri <cit> . human hepcidin is induced by il- <dig>  <cit> , and we previously observed that transgenic zebrafish expressing tilapia hepcidin 2– <dig> had higher transcript levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tlr4a, and tnf-α as compared with wild-type zebrafish  <cit> . the gene encoding the hepcidin-like antimicrobial peptide precursor was strongly induced by infection at  <dig> and 8 h, and signs of increased expression suggest that grouper larvae may be dependent on hepcidin function from  <dig> to 8 h.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study suggests that the response of epinephelus coioides larvae to v. alginolyticus infection is dependent on the complement pathway and antimicrobial peptides. hepcidin, which plays important roles during the larvae stages of grouper, may also be involved in the defense against bacterial infection . these results may be useful to research on fish, as they suggest that the complement pathway and antimicrobial peptides may be beneficial in terms of enhancing grouper anti-bacterial defenses.
