BACKGROUND
improving protein thermostability is an important goal of protein engineering  <cit> ; by making enzymes easier to handle, increased thermostability can increase storage options and expand the temperature range of applications, and facilitate the commercial development of enzymatic products  <cit> . mutations at certain residues can significantly alter a protein's structure and thermostability  <cit> . the free energy  of denaturation can be altered by single- or multi-site mutations; the change in Δg , an indication of the change in protein thermostability, has been determined for many mutated proteins by the thermal denaturation method  <cit> . these data have been collected and deposited in publicly available databases  <cit> . from these data it is possible to develop computational methods to identify mutations in silico that could improve protein thermostability.

various methods  <cit>  have been proposed to predict thermostability changes brought about by protein mutations; these methods have been based on changes in structural energy  <cit> , statistical analyses of mutant protein thermostability  <cit> , and machine learning  <cit> . methods based on changes in structural energy typically attempt to analyze changes in physical energy potentials  <cit> , either by calculation, statistical analysis, or empirical measurement, with the objective of understanding the effects of mutations by comparing the energy difference between the wild-type and mutant structures  <cit> .

recently, various machine learning approaches based on support vector machines   <cit> , neural networks  <cit> , and decision trees  <cit>  have been proposed for predicting the effects of mutations on thermostability  <cit> . these approaches typically use large datasets of known primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of proteins to train the complex nonlinear functions.

most approaches to predicting stability changes caused by mutations focus on a small number of mutations in a protein, often at a single site  <cit> . however, many factors, such as hydrophobicity, van der waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, ion pairs, and non-covalent interactions, contribute to protein thermostability  <cit> . thus, multi-site mutations would typically be expected to have a greater and more complex effect on protein thermostability than can be determined from single-site mutations alone  <cit> .

it is thus necessary to have a reliable method for discriminating between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, as well as for predicting the effects of single- and multi-site mutations on the thermostability of proteins. in this study, we introduce the program "prethermut" , which predicts protein thermostability changes caused by single- or multi-site mutations. the program uses machine learning to construct classification models  and regression models . the input feature of prethermut was developed from structural energy calculations derived from empirical measurements of energy potentials and certain structural attributes reflecting non-covalent interactions between residues within the 3-d structure. two large non-redundant datasets, the m-dataset and s-dataset, were used to train prethermut and test its robustness, respectively.

RESULTS
training and validation
to train the models of prethermut, a dataset  was constructed, containing data from  <dig> mutants. in the m-dataset,  <dig> mutants had increased stability, with a mean ΔΔg of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol, and  <dig> mutants had decreased stability, with a mean ΔΔg of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol. the number of mutation sites in the m-dataset ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the input features of prethermut were calculated from the structural features listed in table  <dig>  which include structural energies calculated from empirical measurements of energy potentials  <cit>  and certain structural attributes reflecting non-covalent interactions between residues in the 3-d structure  <cit> .

all of the results were obtained by a 10-fold cross validation on the m-dataset. see methods for definitions of overall accuracy , matthews correlation coefficient , sensitivity, specificity, and pearson correlation coefficient . athe number of trees in the random forests  method is 10000; the parameters for the support vector machine  method are gamma  =  <dig>  cost  =  <dig>  and the weight for the positive samples  =  <dig>  bn is the number of mutant proteins in the sample; the total number of proteins in the m-dataset was  <dig> 

athe corresponding feature was calculated by the programs . bthe frequency of short non-covalent contacts with a distance of less than  <dig>  Å.

the classifiers of random forests  and support vector machines  were trained on the m-dataset to predict whether the mutations were stabilizing or destabilizing . the regression methods of random forest regression  and support vector regression  were used to predict the change in free energy  of thermal denaturation of the mutant proteins. because the number of mutants in the training set having increased thermostability was disproportionately small versus those with decreased thermostability , the down sampling approach  <cit>  was used for rf implementation, and for svm implementation the weight given to the mutants with increased thermostability was 3-fold greater than that given to the mutants with decreased thermostability. the performance of the methods was assessed by a 10-fold cross validation on the m-dataset .

the classifiers of rf and svm yielded a similar overall accuracy  of  <dig> % on the m-dataset. however, the matthews correlation coefficient  of the rf classifier was  <dig> , while that of the svm classifier was  <dig> . this indicates that the rf classifier was better at distinguishing between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. the better performance of the rf classifier was probably due to the imbalance of the two classes in the m-dataset and may indicate that the rf algorithm was better at accommodating this imbalance than svm. to further investigate the robustness of the svm and rf classifiers, receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted based on 10-fold cross validation tests on the m-dataset . the values for the area under the curve for the svm and rf classifiers were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these results indicate that the rf and svm classifiers could be used to predict which mutations were stabilizing or destabilizing and that the rf classifier was a better performer than the svm classifier.

the importance of each variable to the input vector of prethermut was also assessed by evaluating the decrease in the classification accuracy of rf  <cit> . as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  all structural features contributed to the predictor, with the most important feature being the total energy, as calculated by foldx  <cit> .

as described in the methods section, the input vector of prethermut was calculated on the basis of k different structural features of a mutant protein. here, we evaluated the effect of using different numbers of structural features to build the input vector. as shown in figure  <dig>  q <dig> and the pearson correlation coefficient  for regression became balanced when the value of k was greater than  <dig>  we also tested the effect of different numbers of classification trees in the rf. as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the performance of prethermut was not affected when the number of trees was greater than  <dig> 

two regression predictors were trained to directly estimate the ΔΔg values by the svr and rfr algorithms. regression performance was evaluated based on the results of 10-fold cross validation of the m-dataset . the svr predictor was trained based on the radial basis function  kernel with parameters gamma  =  <dig> and cost  =  <dig>  pearson's r of the svr-predicted and experimental data was  <dig> . the results of rfr  showed better performance than svr. pearson's r of the rfr-predicted and experimental data was  <dig> .

prediction accuracy using different numbers of mutation sites
we examined the performance of prethermut in predicting the changes in thermal stability of mutant proteins containing different numbers of mutations. as shown in table  <dig>  the classification or regression accuracy was better with a larger number of mutations. for example, q <dig> and pearson's r for the prediction of thermostability of proteins containing three mutations, as predicted by rf or rfr, were  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively, which was better than the results obtained with proteins having one or two mutations. we also calculated the average absolute value of ΔΔg of the mutant proteins having different numbers of mutations. the average absolute value of ΔΔg for proteins carrying one, two, three, or more than three mutations was  <dig>  kcal/mol,  <dig>  kcal/mol,  <dig>  kcal/mol, and  <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively. these results indicate that the change in protein thermostability was greater with increasing number of mutations. the prediction accuracy was also evaluated as a function of the magnitude of absolute ΔΔg. as shown in table  <dig>  the larger the value of absolute ΔΔg, the greater the accuracy of the prediction.

all results were obtained by a 10-fold cross validation on the m-dataset. see methods for definitions of overall accuracy , matthews correlation coefficient , sensitivity, specificity, and pearson correlation coefficient . athe number of trees in the random forests  method is 10000; the parameters for the support vector machine  method are gamma  =  <dig>  cost  =  <dig>  and the weight for the positive samples  =  <dig>  bm is the number of mutant proteins in the m-dataset that have the same range of absolute ΔΔg.

reliability index of classification by prethermut
when machine learning is used to classify samples, it is important to know the reliability of the prediction results  <cit> . in this study, a reliability index  was assigned to a prediction, depending on the output of svm or rf. the output o of svm or rf ranged from zero to one, and the ri value was computed as ri = integer). thus, the ri value reflects, on a scale of zero to ten, the degree of certainty of the classification; as the output o approaches the extreme of zero or one, the ri value approaches its maximum value. figure  <dig> shows the expected prediction accuracies and the fraction of mutants yielding a given ri value. for example, approximately 28% of the mutants had an ri ≥  <dig> for the rf method and of these, 96% were correctly predicted. all of the results were obtained by svm or rf with 10-fold cross validation of the m-dataset.

comparison with other methods
professor gideon schreiber  <cit>  constructed an independent dataset and systematically assessed the performance of the frequently used computational methods of cc/pbsa  <cit> , egad  <cit> , foldx  <cit> , hunter  <cit> , i-mutant <dig>   <cit> , rosetta  <cit>  and the combining method  <cit> . we chose the schreiber dataset  to test the performance of prethermut to compare it with the published results from these other methods. as shown in table  <dig>  prethermut predicted the thermostability of all the mutant proteins in the s-dataset having known wild-type structure with a better classification and regression accuracy than any of the other methods. this excellent performance of prethermut was due to its efficient machine learning methods and the more determinant structural features used as inputs.

CONCLUSIONS
several predictors  <cit>  have been constructed to predict the effect of a single mutation on protein thermostability, based on structural or sequence features. however, multi-site mutations usually have a greater effect on protein thermostability than single-site mutations  <cit> . in this study, we present a predictive computer program, called prethermut, based on machine learning methods, that can directly predict the effect of single- and multi-site mutations on protein thermostability from the wild-type protein's structural features.

the high predictive power of prethermut, assessed by a rigorous 10-fold cross validation procedure, is illustrated by a q <dig> value of  <dig> % for the classification of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations from the m-dataset, and a pearson's r of  <dig>  for the correlation between predicted and experimentally determined ΔΔg values. the performance of prethermut was also assessed in the independent s-dataset of more than  <dig> mutants. prethermut outperformed several published structure- and sequence-based predictors using the s-dataset. although direct comparison of prethermut with the other published predictors is not appropriate, because of differences in datasets used for training and testing, as well as the information used to develop the models, the results indicate that prethermut is a powerful tool for predicting the effect of mutations on protein thermostability.
