BACKGROUND
the domestication of the modern dog from their wolf ancestors has resulted in an extraordinary amount of diversity in canine form and function. as such, dogs are poised to provide unique insights into the genetic architecture of phenotypic variation and the mechanistic basis of strong artificial selection. a number of canine genomics resources have been developed to facilitate genotype-phenotype inferences, including a high-quality whole genome sequence and a dense catalog of snps discovered in a wide variety of breeds  <cit> . these genomics resources have been successfully used to identify an increasing number of genes that influence hallmark breed characteristics such as size, coat texture, and skin wrinkling  <cit> . additionally, snp data has been used to investigate patterns of genetic variation within and between breeds, establish timing and geography of domestication, examine relatedness among breeds, and identify signatures of artificial selection  <cit> .

in addition to snps, it is important to characterize additional components of canine genomic variation in order to comprehensively assess the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity. for example, structural variation in general, and copy number variants  in particular, has emerged as an important source of genetic variation in a wide range of organisms including dogs  <cit> . duplications and deletions of genomic sequence can have significant impacts on a wide range of phenotypes including breed-defining traits. for example, a duplication of a set of fgf genes in rhodesian and thai ridgebacks leads to the breeds characteristic dorsal hair ridge  <cit> .

although the fgf duplication provides a vivid example of the phenotypic consequences of structural variation in dogs, it remains unknown whether cnvs are an appreciable source of variation in morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits within and between breeds. comprehensive discovery of structural variation in a diverse panel of breeds is an important first step in more systemically delimiting the contribution of cnvs to canine phenotypic variation. previously, we used a customized acgh chip to identify nearly  <dig> cnv regions located in segmental duplications   <cit> . however, sds only cover approximately 5% of the dog genome and thus a large fraction of total genomic space was unexplored. an additional study using a genome-wide tiling array from nimblegen identified approximately  <dig> cnv regions outside of sds  <cit> . however, the low probe density , limited the number and size of cnvs that could be identified.

in an effort to more comprehensively interrogate the canine genome for cnvs, we used a high-density  genome-wide tiling array to discover additional cnvs in a panel of nine genetically and phenotypically diverse dogs. in total, we discover over  <dig> new cnv regions. moreover, we designed a custom acgh chip to genotype all known canine cnvs in  <dig> dogs from  <dig> diverse breeds, allowing the first population genetics analysis of structural variation in dogs to be performed. the comprehensive cnv resources that we have developed will be important tools in genetically dissecting canine phenotypic variation.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of cnvs using a high-density acgh chip
we performed acgh using a high-density tiling array in nine breeds , a gray wolf, and a self-self hybridization. these nine breeds and gray wolf samples were previously studied using a custom array that exclusively targeted regions containing sds  <cit> . in all of the acgh hybridizations we used the same reference sample , which was also the reference in our prior sd experiments  <cit> . the acgh chip consists of over  <dig>  million probes distributed across the genome  with an average probe density of  <dig> kb. cnvs were identified using a circular binary segmentation algorithm implemented in the program segmnt, part of nimblegen's nimblescan software package. these calls were filtered by log <dig> values and number of probes using an adaptive threshold algorithm where the specific filtering criteria were a function of the size of the cnv .

we identified  <dig>  cnvs in  <dig> unique cnv regions spanning  <dig>  mb of genomic sequence . in the self-self hybridization, no cnvs were called using the same analysis and filters. the average number of cnvs per individual was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average cnv size was approximately  <dig> kb , and the largest cnv region was located on cfa  <dig> and spans  <dig>  mb. in total, these  <dig> cnv regions overlap or contain  <dig> protein coding genes. after assigning all genes panther molecular function terms, we found that the most enriched gene classes are similar to those identified in sds, namely, defense/immunity, and receptor genes, but also included oxidoreductase, protease, signaling molecule, and transporter genes .

comparison of sd vs non-sd cnvs
we used the same individuals and reference sample as in our previous study of cnvs in segmental duplications, providing an opportunity to directly compare characteristics of cnvs between sds and non-sd regions . while most cnvs were not associated with sds, on average cnvs associated with sds were much larger  resulting in the majority of cnv space to be associated with sds . similarly, the majority of genic cnvs were also found in cnvs associated with sds .

of the  <dig> distinct cnv regions,  <dig> are present in multiple individuals and  <dig> were identified in a single individual. interestingly, approximately 80% of these "singletons" are located outside of sds  as has been observed in humans  <cit> . moreover, cnv complexity was markedly different between sd and non-sd cnvs. specifically, we define cnv regions that exhibit both gains and losses in copy number within a single individual as complex. while only  <dig> complex regions were identified, they are all from segmental duplications. these observations are consistent with the dynamic nature of sds  <cit> , which are likely to harbor cnvs that are polymorphic within and between breeds.

cnv genotyping using a custom acgh chip
to better understand how cnv variation is apportioned within and between breeds, we designed a custom 12-plex nimblegen acgh chip and genotyped  <dig> dogs from  <dig> diverse breeds  for all known canine cnvs . the average probe density was approximately  <dig> bp, and all of the hybridizations were performed with the same female boxer used in previous acgh experiments. we used a hidden markov model implemented in the software package rjacgh  <cit>  to call cnvs for each cnv region in each sample . the rjacgh software package assigns a posterior probability to each acgh probe as being in a gain, loss, or normal copy state. a summary of the posterior probabilities of each probe across all  <dig> individuals is shown in figure  <dig> 

a denotes the number of individuals studied.

b average number of cnvs per individual

c indicates the range in the number of cnvs identified per individual within each breed.

raw cnv calls from rjacgh were filtered based on the number of data points, average posterior probabilities for probes in the putative cnv, and average log <dig> values . of the  <dig> regions studied,  <dig>  had at least one individual containing a cnv. over 95% of the cnv regions that appeared as monomorphic were previously identified in a breed not studied in the cnv genotyping panel; thus, failure to confirm cnvs in these regions is likely due to both individual or breed specific cnvs and false positives in previous cnv discovery experiments. as shown in table  <dig>  the average number of cnvs across all individuals was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

before pursuing detailed population genetics inferences, we performed three analyses to assess data quality and false discovery rates. first, we performed three self-self hybridizations of a boxer, greyhound, and shar-pei. using the same criteria to identify cnvs as described above, we called  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cnvs in the shar-pei, boxer, and greyhound, respectively. thus, the self-self hybridizations suggest a low false discovery rate . second, we included  <dig> control regions on the genotyping acgh chip selected from putatively single copy sequence defined from earlier cnv experiments  <cit> . across all individuals, and thus a total  <dig> Ã—  <dig> =  <dig>  total control regions, only  <dig> cnvs were called , which also suggests a low false discovery rate. note, it is plausible that genuine cnvs exist in some of these putative single copy control sequences, which were not observed in previous studies that examined a smaller number of individuals. indeed, monte carlo simulations demonstrate that the expected number of control regions to harbor a cnv given  <dig> false positives is  <dig> , suggesting that the observed patterns of cnvs in control regions are more clustered than expected by chance and hence some may be genuine cnvs. third, three of the individuals included in the genotyping panel  were also previously interrogated for cnvs with the sd  <cit>  and  <dig>  chips . the average overlap between cnvs called in the previous acgh experiments and the genotyping chip across all three samples was  <dig> %. to interpret the observed amount of overlap, we performed extensive simulations that recapitulate characteristics of the three acgh chips and distribution of log <dig> values . the observed overlap was similar to the simulated data , and the discordances are primarily a result of different probe densities across chips that influences the power to detect cnvs. overall, these three analyses suggest the cnv genotype data is of high quality.

furthermore, we also examined whether cnv calls were more concordant between the genotyping chip and the sd chip or between the genotyping chip and nimblegen  <dig>  tiling array. in general, the concordances were similar, but higher for cnvs initially discovered on the sd chip  than cnvs discovered on the nimblegen  <dig>  tiling chip . moreover, as expected, larger cnvs  were more concordant  than smaller  cnvs .

patterns of cnv diversity within breeds
we estimated approximate allele frequencies for each breed and for each cnv using a simple em algorithm  <cit>  . from these allele frequencies, we calculated the expected heterozygosity  for each breed at every polymorphic cnv region, and the average he for each breed is shown in table  <dig>  as expected from snp and sequence data  <cit> , boxers were the least diverse breed studied and border collies were the most diverse breed . interestingly, we observe a significant difference  in the average he between cnvs from sds and cnvs not from sd  in all breeds, consistent with the dynamic nature of sds leading to increased segregating variation.

to better understand how cnvs contribute to within breed diversity, we searched for cnv regions that exhibited high levels of heterozygosity. interestingly,  <dig> regions were identified that exhibited high diversity in one or more breeds . for example, a cnv region on cfa <dig> was identified in the standard poodle, which contains a number of genes, such as psors1c <dig>  cdsn, and cchcr <dig>  that are associated with various epithelial processes and skin disorders . standard poodles are a breed marked with common occurrences of skin disorders or disorders with epithelial symptoms such as cushing's disease   <cit>  and sebaceous adenitis  <cit> . additionally some skin disorders, such as psoriasis in humans, have been associated with copy number polymorphisms  <cit> . thus, psors1c <dig>  cdsn, and cchcr <dig> are excellent candidates to pursue in future association studies of skin phenotypes in standard poodles. furthermore, a topoisomerase gene, top3b, involved in the cutting of dna strands during transcription and recombination  <cit> , was also found to be polymorphic in six breeds .

patterns of cnv diversity between breeds
to better understand patterns of cnv variation between breeds, we calculated fst for each polymorphic cnv region. the distribution of fst across all cnv regions is shown in figure  <dig>  which ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average fst is  <dig> , which is comparable, although slightly lower than estimates of fst in snp data  <cit> . no significant difference in fst was detected between sd and non-sd cnvs . a number of interesting genes exist among the top  <dig> most differentiated cnv regions that may be relevant to phenotypic variation between breeds, such as atbf <dig>  a zinc finger transcription factor that regulates neuronal and muscle development  <cit>  and nkain <dig>  which is associated with susceptibility to lymphoma  <cit> , the most common form of canine cancer  <cit> .

in addition, we also identified cnvs where all individuals within one or more breeds carried a duplication or deletion, but was absent in at least one of the remaining breeds. in total,  <dig> such regions exhibiting this pattern were identified ,  <dig> of which overlap the top  <dig> most differentiated cnvs described above. a number of these divergent regions possessed genes that potentially contribute to phenotypic differences between breeds such as development , neuronal processes , olfaction , and metabolism .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have compiled the most comprehensive catalog of canine structural variation described to date. moreover, we examined patterns of variation for all known canine cnvs in a diverse panel of  <dig> breeds, providing the first insight into how structural variation is apportioned within and between breeds. interestingly, we found high levels of cnv diversity within breeds, suggesting that structural variation may be an important source of genetic variation contributing to within breed patterns of phenotypic diversity. moreover, our data is consistent with a high rate of de novo cnv formation within breeds. we anticipate that the cnv resources developed in this work will complement existing genome-wide panels of snp markers  <cit>  by providing the foundation for future association studies to delimit how structural variation contributes to canine phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility.
