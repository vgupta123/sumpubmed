BACKGROUND
phage display of antibody fragments is now well established technology and has enabled the construction and selection of a large size of antibody library in vitro <cit> . selection of phage library includes panning procedure for enrichment of target-specific phage and subsequent screening procedure for individual phage clones. for the evaluation of candidate clones, antibody fragments in the form of scfv or fab can usually be expressed in enough quantity by bacterial cells. though bacterial expression is sufficient for most purposes, some sensitive biological assays as well as in vivo validation prefer mammalian expression of antibody. several reports has thus described construction of cassette-type vectors for rapid conversion of phage-displayed antibody fragments into whole igg or scfv-fc format to accelerate the validation process that is done under in vivo conditions closely mimicking those expected to occur with therapeutics and imaging agents  <cit> .

for the development of therapeutic or imaging agents, cell surface antigens are attractive targets. cell panning procedure that allows selection of phage-displayed antibody library directly on intact cells has been employed to target the antigens in their native conformation at the surface of cells  <cit> . the procedure can overcome the limitations of the conventional selection procedure using purified recombinant antigens immobilized on artificial surfaces. in fact, some cell surface proteins cannot be expressed in recombinant forms that retain their native conformation, and antibodies selected using the recombinant proteins may not bind to original proteins on cell surface. furthermore, the procedure gives chances to target novel epitope space created by disease-related overexpression or modification of cell surface proteins.

cd <dig> is a cell surface glycoprotein that belongs to the tetraspanin family containing four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops  <cit> . its expression has been recently reported to be related to some cancers and proposed to be a potential therapeutic target  <cit> . in this study, we aimed to generate antibodies recognizing cd <dig> on the cell surface in its native conformation. for this purpose, stable transfectant expressing cd <dig> has been constructed and used for entire process of panning of phage library and subsequent screening and characterization of individual antibody clones.

to facilitate the whole cell-based screening and characterization, we took advantage of an integrated vector system which allows direct conversion of scfv phage into scfv-fc format  <cit> . after cell panning on the cd transfectant, the enriched scfv repertoire in phagemid vector, pdr-d <dig> was transferred into mammalian cassette vector, pdr-orip-fc <dig> simply by cut and paste restriction fragment cloning. enough amount of scfv-fc could be obtained from transient expression by using the resulting constructs in hek293e cells, which enabled rapid identification and characterization of specific binders to cell surface cd <dig> using flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. the results demonstrate feasibility of the strategy using the integrated vector system that allows use of scfv-fc as a reliable format for rapid cell-based antibody screening and validation.

RESULTS
design features of the integrated vector system
here we used two vectors, pdr-d <dig>  for phage display of scfv and pdr-orip-fc <dig>  for mammalian expression of scfv-fc. they are designed to allow rapid shuttling of scfv inserts, and the sequences of scfv inserts in pdr-d <dig> can be directly transferred into pdr-orip-fc <dig> simply by cut and paste restriction fragment cloning without pcr-amplification step. detailed sequences show design features of the integrated vector system .

pdr-d <dig> includes pelb signal sequences for periplasmic expression in e. coli and two sfii restriction sites  for the cloning of scfv . the two sfii sites have different nnnnn sequences, which results in two different sticky ends allowing a directional cloning  <cit> . the sequences for myc tag are followed by sfii sites for the detection of scfv expression. also, pdr-d <dig> includes gene iii sequences  for the display of scfv. the gene iii sequences are designed to be removable by two noti restriction sites for soluble expression of scfv. the sequences for his <dig> tag are designed to be attached to those for myc tag after removing gene iii sequences for the detection and purification of scfv.

for in-frame transfer of scfv from pdr-d <dig>  pdr-orip-fc <dig> was designed to have hybrid signal sequences . the initial half sequences  are derived from mouse kappa leader sequences, and the last half sequences  from pelb leader sequences. the derived hybrid signal peptide was proved to be functional in mammalian cells before  <cit> . the resulting construct has the same sfii sites as those in pdr-d <dig> and, even unknown sequences derived from pdr-d <dig> based library can be directly cloned into pdr-orip-fc <dig>  the cloned scfv is designed to be fused to human fcγ <dig> through the hinge region which results in fc-fused dimer forms when expressed in mammalian cells. pdr-orip-fc <dig> also includes orip sequences which allows enhanced and prolonged protein expression in 293e cells containing ebna- <dig>  <cit> .

selection of antibodies recognizing cd <dig> on cell surface
a naïve mouse scfv library with an estimated diversity of 2 ×  <dig> was prepared by cloning antibody repertoire derived from mouse splenocytes into pdr-d <dig> as described in materials and methods. integrity of the library was confirmed by dna sequencing of scfv inserts from randomly picked library clones. library phages were rescued using vcsm <dig> helper phage and confirmed for scfv display on phage surface using western blot .

to select antibodies against native form of cd <dig> on cell surface, cell panning was performed using a stable cd <dig> transfectant, hek293-cd <dig>  the library phages were pre-cleared by subtraction panning with parental hek <dig> to deplete non-specific binding phages. the pre-cleared phages were incubated with hek293-cd <dig> cells, and bound phages were recovered and amplified for next round of panning. three rounds of panning were performed, and enrichment of hek293-cd <dig> binders was monitored by titering the number of phage recovered after panning. phage recovery rate  after the 3rd round was about 200-fold higher than that after the 1st round , which indicated successful enrichment of hek293-cd <dig> binders.

for reliable screening of individual antibody clones, scfv-fc format was chosen instead of phage format. the use of mammalian cassette vector, pdr-orip-fc <dig> allowed the rapid conversion as described above. the scfv repertoire in the phage pool enriched after 3rd round of panning was directly transferred to mammalian cassette vector for scfv-fc expression by cloning scfv inserts extracted from phagemid dna prepared after 3rd round of panning into pdr-orip-fc <dig>  twenty clones were randomly selected and subjected to dna sequencing. ten unique scfv sequences were identified, and the vectors harboring the scfv sequences were transfected into 293e cells for transient expression. the culture supernatant was confirmed for scfv-fc expression by detection of 55 kda bands in western blot analysis  and directly used for flow cytometric screening of scfv-fc for its binding to hek293-cd <dig> . ha <dig> specific for hav  was used as negative control, and mm2/ <dig>  anti-cd <dig> mab was used as positive control. three clones  were strongly positive for binding to hek293-cd <dig> and could differentiate cd <dig> overexpression like mm2/ <dig>  however, the other clones such as e <dig> were not positive and could not differentiate cd <dig> overexpression .

characterization of scfv-fcs
for further characterization, the selected scfv-fcs were purified from the culture supernatants by using protein g column. from 30 ml of serum-free culture supernatant, 100 ~ 200 μg of purified scfv-fc could be obtained, and its purity was confirmed by a single 55 kda band on a 12% sds-page in reducing condition .

first, their binding specificity for cd <dig> was tested by using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting . as anticipated, e <dig>  e <dig> and f <dig> could pull down about 25 kda of cd <dig> molecules from cell lysate of hek293-cd <dig>  which was recognized by immunobloting with mm2/ <dig>  this result confirmed cd9-specificity of the selected antibodies indicating success of the cell-based selection.

next, we examined whether the selected scfv-fcs could recognize endogenous cd <dig> expression on human cancer cells using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. two cancer cell lines were used for comparison. mkn- <dig>  a human gastric cancer cell line is known to overexpress cd <dig>  whereas hepg <dig>  hepatocarcinoma cell line not to express cd <dig>  <cit> . as expected, flow cytometric analysis revealed strong binding of all three scfv-fcs to mkn- <dig> when compared with their binding to hepg <dig> . this strong binding could be confirmed by localizing cd <dig> staining on mkn- <dig> with the scfv-fcs using confocal microscopy . cd <dig> staining by the scfv-fcs and mm2/ <dig> was mainly observed on the cell membrane of mkn- <dig> but not on that of hepg <dig> whereas staining by ha <dig> was barely seen for both cell lines. hence, all three scfv-fvs could specifically recognize endogenous cd <dig> expression on the cell membrane of mkn- <dig> 

finally, competition binding experiments using flow cytometry were carried out to test whether the binding epitopes of the selected scfv-fcs would overlap with that of mm2/ <dig>  mm2/ <dig> is known to recognize large extracellular loop  of cd <dig> molecule  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  addition of e <dig> or f <dig> as competitor inhibited the binding of mm2/ <dig> to mkn- <dig> cells while addition of e <dig> did not affect the binding at all like ha <dig>  the data suggest that e <dig> and f <dig> share their epitopes with mm2/ <dig> that may be present at ecl <dig> domain of cd <dig> molecule.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated an efficient selection of antibodies recognizing cell surface cd <dig> from phage-displayed scfv library by taking advantage of an integrated vector system. a mouse scfv library was constructed using phagemid vector, pdr-d <dig>  and after cell panning against cd <dig> transfectant, the enriched scfv repertoire was directly transferred to mammalian cassette vector, pdr-orip-fc <dig>  since the resulting cassette vector constructs enabled transient expression of enough amounts of scfv-fcs in hek293e cells, flow cytometric screening of binders for cd <dig> transfectant could be performed simply by using the culture supernatants . compared with phage, scfv-fc format could be preferred choice for the reliable screening of individual clones especially after cell panning procedure. it is known that cell panning procedure usually suffers from high background binding of non-specific phages  <cit> . likewise, phage screening directly on cell can cause selection of non-specific binders. by adapting scfv-fc format instead of phage, we wished to discriminate cd9-specific binders from non-specific binders at the screening step. in fact, all three clones selected from facs screening were found to be cd9-specific .

their specificity could be confirmed by recognition of endogenous cd <dig> expression on cancer cells. it appeared that their binding results were slightly positive even on cd <dig> negative hepg <dig> cells by flow cytometry when compared with that of anti-cd <dig> mab, mm2/ <dig> . this might be attributed to their lower specificity. however, all three could correctly localize membrane-bound cd <dig>  and the results were comparable to that of mm2/ <dig> . most anti-tetraspanin mabs including mm2/ <dig> is known to recognize epitopes within ecl <dig> regions  <cit> . our competition data indicated that two of selected scfv-fcs  might recognize the immunodominant epitope regions at the ecl <dig> domain of cd <dig> which overlap with that of mm2/ <dig> . but the other one, e <dig> showed different epitope specificity. cd <dig> like the other tetrapanins can assemble into multimolecular membrane complexes by homo- or hetero-clustering  <cit> . cell-based selection with intensive screening can give more chances to select rare antibodies recognizing novel epitopes created by such dynamic molecular changes.

direct selection of phage-displayed antibody library on intact cells is inevitable for some cell surface proteins with complex structural features which make them difficult to be recombinantly expressed in fully native forms. selection on such recombinant proteins could result in antibodies that failed to correctly recognize their original conformation on cell surface as exemplified previously  <cit> . cell-based selection has another advantage over recombinant protein-based selection in that it can give a chance to generate antibodies with novel epitope specificity that can differentiate disease-related cell surface signatures. according to studies on epitope structure of tumor-associated epidermal growth factor receptor , egfr overexpression on cancer cells exposes neo-epitope that is not found in egfr on normal tissues  <cit> . besides overexpression, other factors such as aberrant posttranslational modification and multi-molecular clustering can affect conformation of cell surface proteins, which may result in exposure of novel epitope space.

CONCLUSIONS
cell surface expression of disease-related proteins such as tumor-associated antigens is promising target of antibody development for therapeutic and imaging applications. cell-based selection using phage-displayed antibody library is a powerful tool for such purpose but needs reliable evaluation of specific binders for efficient selection. as demonstrated in this report, rapid conversion of the scfv phages enriched after cell panning into scfv-fc format by taking advantage of a mammalian cassette vector will allow efficient development of antibodies for diverse cell surface proteins with complex conformation by accelerating cell-based evaluation steps.
