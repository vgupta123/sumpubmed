BACKGROUND
dna methylation and histone modifications are important epigenetic mechanisms for gene regulation in eukaryotes  <cit> . in plants, epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in development  <cit> , flowering  <cit> , pathogen recognition  <cit> , senescence  <cit>  and somaclonal variation  <cit> . it has been found that dna methylation/demethylation is affected by exogenous and endogenous factors in both in vivo and in vitro conditions, such as auxin concentration, temperature and aging  <cit> . dna methylation patterns can also change, depending on the method of plant propagation  <cit> .

the use of in vitro plant propagation techniques allows the scale up of crops of agronomic importance  <cit> , maintaining genetic stability among clones. although clonal plants are usually very stable at the genetic level, epigenetic modifications in dna  <cit> , as well as histones  <cit> , mainly by methylation in lysine  <dig> and  <dig> of the histone h <dig>  could be affected and, therefore, induce somaclonal variation  <cit> . there is evidence of epigenetic changes, although some can be quite stable with time  <cit> , occurring during in vitro culture. for instance, valledor et al. <cit>  found that an increase in plant vigor and rejuvenation is due to dna methylation. on the other hand, it has been found that the decrease in organogenesis capability of pinus radiata was related to low levels of acetylation in histone h <dig> and high levels of dna methylation  <cit> . it has been proposed that the changes in dna methylation patterns in maize and apple are induced by tissue culture during in vitro conditions  <cit> , and these methylation patterns play an important role during plant development  <cit> . furthermore, not only methylation  <cit>  but also demethylation in the dna could cause epigenetic alterations that provoke abnormalities during the in vitro process  <cit> . one of the factors involved in epigenetic changes during in vitro conditions is the exposure to growth regulators, which are widely used in plant tissue culture  <cit>  to promote multiplication and growth.

plant growth regulators have been involved in the expression of several genes, and some studies have even suggested reciprocal links between growth regulators and homeobox genes  <cit> . one of the most studied homeobox genes regulated by plant growth regulators is the knotted1-like homeobox  transcription factor group  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, there are eight knox genes that have been divided into two classes. stm, knat <dig>  knat <dig> and knat <dig> belong to class i, while knat <dig>  knat <dig>  knat <dig> and knat <dig> fall into class ii  <cit> . the expression of two, knat <dig> and knat <dig>  is altered by cytokinins and auxins  <cit> . rupp et al. <cit>  found an increase in the transcription level of knat <dig> in the cytokinin-overproducing mutant amp <dig>  which might occur by acting through the activation of knat <dig>  furthermore, dean et al. <cit>  found in a. thaliana that exogenous auxin treatments alter the promoter activity of the gene knat <dig>  in the same way, montero-cortes et al. <cit>  found that in somatic embryos from micropropagated coconut plants, the expression of cnknox <dig> was stimulated by gibberellic acid, while in cnknox <dig> the hormone produced a decrease in its expression. taking all these findings as a whole, it is clear that plant growth regulators have an important impact on knox genes.

studies done in agave tequilana have shown that knox genes are associated with organogenesis during bulbil formation  <cit> . according to abraham-juarez et al. <cit> , atqknox <dig>  homologous to knat <dig>  and atqknox <dig>  homologous to knat <dig>  presented an increase in the levels of expression as bulbils mature. the regulation of knox genes in agave has not been clearly understood, but studies in arabidopsis and maize suggest that chromatin configuration could be an important factor in the regulation of these genes  <cit> . in humans, homeobox genes, which encode transcription factors evolutionarily conserved, are epigenetically regulated  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that, as in animals, plant homeobox genes, such as knox, can also be epigenetically regulated.

although the epigenome is highly dependent on the surrounding environment  <cit> , the epigenetic changes that occur under in vitro conditions are still unknown, as is how these changes impact plants’ development in the field. in order to understand the effect of in vitro conditions on the epigenetic regulation of atqknox <dig>  and atqknox <dig> , in this study we provide a detailed epigenetic analysis comparing different agave plants cultured under different in vitro and ex vitro conditions.

RESULTS
in order to assess the epigenetic and molecular differences that might be occurring in agave plants cultured in different in vitro systems , as well as in ex vitro conditions, we used three different agave fourcroydes clones  and one a. angustifolia clone  . sixteen-week-old clones were cultured in vitro , as described in methods, and transferred for five weeks to two different in vitro growth systems: semisolid in magenta boxes  and temporary immersion in modular bioreactors . after that treatment, the plants from each in vitro growth system  were transplanted to soil , where they stayed for two months ex vitro . in total, five culture conditions  were evaluated for each clone .

as previously reported by robert et al. <cit> , it was observed that after five weeks in in vitro, the a. fourcroydes plants under bioreactor conditions developed better than those grown in magenta boxes; they were shorter, more vigorous and presented a more intense coloration . a similar situation was observed in the a. angustifolia clone , which also produced more leaves when cultured in the bioreactor. these phenotypic characteristics were not conserved once the bm <dig> plants were evaluated eight weeks later in ex vitro conditions . many of the bm <dig> plants did not survive after a couple of weeks ex vitro, and the few plants that did survive were small, pale and had only a few roots. in contrast, more than 90% of the a. fourcroydes plants  survived. they grew rapidly, produced many strong roots and the leaves developed the characteristic purple color in .

transfer to ex vitro conditions increases dna methylation in agave angustifolia
to gain insight into dna methylation from plants grown in two different systems during in vitro  and ex vitro  conditions, three different a. fourcroydes clones  and one a. angustifolia clone  were chosen as starting material . global dna methylation rates were analyzed by hplc  from plants collected at t <dig>  m, b, sm and sb. the global quantification of 5-methyl-deoxycitidine has shown that dna methylation in a. fourcroydes  and a. angustifolia  cultured either in m or b is not significantly different . however, there is a two-fold difference in the dna methylation rate of a. angustifolia in comparison with a. fourcroydes. under ex vitro conditions , it was observed that bm <dig> increases its methylation rate two-fold in comparison with the in vitro conditions, while that of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> showed an increase of  <dig> to 3% from in vitro to ex vitro. only one clone, p <dig>  presented 1% less 5mdc under ex vitro versus in vitro conditions, showing 34% in the plants that were cultured in m in comparison with 33% for those cultured in sm. this suggests that ex vitro conditions could change the methylation behavior in different clones from the same species, potentially resulting in a change in a plant’s performance once it is in the field. on the other hand, we cannot rule out, at least for the case of a. fourcroydes, that the slight increase in dna methylation observed during ex vitro in comparison with in vitro conditions  could be due to plant development.

in vitro conditions induce methylation in h3k9
the western blot analysis using antibodies against the h3k <dig> di- and tri-methylated isoforms, as well as for the h3k9me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> marks , showed important changes in histone methylation patterns in all the clones during ex vitro conditions in comparison with the in vitro ones. in all ex vitro samples , we detected an absence or a low amount of the repressive mark h3k9me <dig>  in spite of the fact that this mark had accumulated noticeably only during in vitro conditions . this suggests the possible formation of heterochromatin-like structures, as a result of the in vitro conditions. marks h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  which are implicated in the activation of transcription  <cit> , were differentially detected among the clones and between in vitro and ex vitro conditions. for instance, h3k4me <dig> was present in all samples and all conditions except p <dig>  for which this mark was absent in sm and present at a very low amount in sb. furthermore, h3k36me <dig> was found in all samples in vitro but absent ex vitro, except for p <dig>  where this mark was also found. in contrast, h3k4me <dig> presented a different pattern in each clone that may lead to the formation of eurochromatic structures as a stress mechanism provoked by in vitro conditions in different plants. therefore, although the clones are genetically very similar, the response of each clone to the in vitro and ex vitro conditions is different, giving a specific epigenetic identity to each. for instance, in p <dig>  h3k4me <dig> accumulated in b, sm and sb, in p <dig> this mark accumulated in m and b, and in p <dig> it accumulated only in b. in bm <dig>  the h3k4me <dig> mark was slightly accumulated in b and sb.

knox expression is induced by in vitro conditions
the effect of in vitro conditions on the expression of the knox genes was analyzed by qrt-pcr assays of p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and bm <dig> in t <dig>  m, b, sm and sb . we found that atqknox <dig> showed expression only in p <dig> and p <dig> at t0; and p <dig> at m. however, the highest expression detected was in p <dig> at b. in the case of ex vitro conditions, this gene was slightly expressed in p <dig> and p <dig> in sm and in p <dig> and bm <dig> in sb. therefore, atqknox <dig> is differentially expressed in the agave clones during in vitro conditions. on the other hand, the expression of atqknox <dig> was low or absent under all culture conditions in the bm <dig> clone. in the case of p <dig>  the expression of atqknox <dig> was almost the same while the clone was in vitro. however, once the plants were in ex vitro conditions, the expression of this gene was almost undetectable. it is worth mentioning that in the case of p <dig>  the expression of atqknox <dig> was low in all culture conditions. however, p <dig> presented the highest expression of atqknox <dig> in b; while in t <dig> and m, the expression of this gene was very similar to p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. furthermore, under ex vitro conditions , atqknox <dig> expression in p <dig> was as low as that of p <dig> 

atqknox <dig> is epigenetically regulated
since in vitro conditions show a differential expression of atqknox <dig> and atqknox <dig> in a. fourcroydes and a. angustifolia clones , we examined the molecular events accompanying the epigenetically induced modification of these genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation  in two clones, one of a. fourcroydes  and one of a. angustifolia  from t <dig>  m, b, sm and sb . normalization of histone h <dig> immunoprecipitated from all samples to the corresponding input fraction revealed changes in h3k4me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  we observed an enrichment of the h3k4me <dig> mark in p <dig> at the b condition in comparison to the input of the atqknox <dig> gene , which correlated with its expression .

the h3k4me <dig> methylation levels in atqknox <dig> in bm <dig> were not detected in any condition, which also correlates with its lack of expression found in figure  <dig>  during in vitro conditions in the bioreactor, the h3k4me <dig> levels increased, favoring the expression due to epigenetic regulation of atqknox <dig> in the clone p <dig>  considering these results and the ones obtained with gene expression studies, it appears that the atqknox <dig> expression  is directly correlated with the h3k4me <dig> levels. furthermore, we determined the levels of h3k9me <dig>  a mark related to heterochromatin and repressive gene regions, of all analyzed genes . we found that only in bm <dig> was there an increase in h3k9me <dig> in atqknox <dig> in all culture conditions. this result is consistent with the lack of expression of this gene in bm <dig> 

these results could help to develop new strategies to optimize the use of more efficient in vitro conditions in order to guarantee the epigenetic stability of the cultures in the field.

discussion
plant tissue culture has been used for many years to propagate elite plants and for genetic breeding  <cit> . in mexico, clonal propagation has been successfully employed to improve revigorization and juvenility in commercial plantations of agave  <cit> . it is known that agave plants cultivated under in vitro conditions for several generations do not contribute to genetic variation among clones  <cit> , but some phenotypic variations have still been found. one of the explanations for these phenotypic changes under in vitro culture could be epigenetic regulation.

there is small but increasing evidence describing the epigenetic changes during in vitro culture. it has been found that not only the environment during the in vitro culture can change the epigenetic profile of the plant  <cit> , but also the epigenetic status of the donor plants; even the organs within the donor plants can determine the later behavior of the explants  <cit> . for instance, it has been found that in vitro conditions change dna methylation  <cit>  and even this epigenetic mechanism has been related to plant development and rejuvenation  <cit> . therefore, the dna hypomethylation found in bm <dig> when this clone was changed from t <dig> to either the magenta box or the bioreactor  could be due to stress  <cit> , which might be related to the increase in the mortality rate observed when these plants were transplanted to soil. another explanation is that rejuvenation is occurring in this clone during its time in the magenta boxes or the bioreactor. valledor et al. <cit>  found that there is a relationship between dna methylation and aging-revigoration in plants, such that aging increases as dna global methylation increases. in plants, dna methylation usually increases with aging  <cit> , while in mammals it decreases with time  <cit> . therefore, the decrease in dna methylation observed in a. angustifolia during in vitro culture  could be a mechanism for rejuvenation.

li et al. <cit>  reported that several physiological changes related to in vitro culture, such as leaf structural changes, modifications in plant water content and changes in photosynthetic systems, are related to the stress provoked by in vitro conditions, and the stress seems to be related to the content of global dna methylation. we observed in agave that the semisolid system in the magenta boxes generates longer leaves in comparison with the plants cultured in the temporary immersion of the modular bioreactors . although we did not observe a significant difference in dna methylation between magenta boxes and bioreactors in the same clone , we observed a difference in histone methylation patterns between plants grown in these two in vitro systems . the genetic expression provoked by stress in plants depends on histone postranslational modifications and dna methylation  <cit> . in the case of histone methylation, there are no reports that explain or suggest either the somaclonal variation or the genes affected epigenetically. although there is information about the role of dna methylation during in vitro culture, the histone modifications and the changes in chromatin modulation are still unknown. we found that clones genetically and even phenotypically alike have different epigenetic responses to in vitro culture . moreover, there are no reports of the epigenetic stability of the micropropagated plants once they are ex vitro; so far, it is unknown whether histone modifications are involved. it is known that the epigenetics of an organism can change depending on development  <cit> , biotic  <cit>  or abiotic interactions  <cit> , and even stress exposure  <cit> . therefore, the mechanism of stress response due to the exposure to growth regulators during in vitro conditions could be one of the candidates for regulation by epigenetic factors. we found that during in vitro conditions, epigenetic modifications in histones , mainly through h3k9me <dig>  which is very important in the initiation and maintenance of heterochromatin silencing  <cit>  and in the control of dna methylation  <cit> , are affected. however, once the plants were transferred to ex vitro conditions in the field, this histone mark was absent or in present in low amounts, suggesting that plants can change the epigenome-phenotype.

in other in vitro systems, such as the potato, the dna methylation variation associated with tissue culture protocols has been investigated  <cit> . it was found that dna methylation changes occurring among the tissue types are an essential factor contributing to developmental stage differences, as well as tissue-culture-induced variation. therefore, the hypermethylation found in p <dig> at sm could be induced by elements of the tissue culture media such as plant hormones, which have been shown to induce methylation changes in plant tissue cultures  <cit> . there is evidence that the use of the auxin  <dig> -d in maize cultures generates changes in the dna methylation pattern, depending on the concentration  <cit> . plant hormones regulate growth and development in plants by controlling the expression of genes involved in these processes.

knox genes have been implicated in plant hormone metabolism  <cit> . hay et al. <cit>  found that auxins repress the knat <dig> gene, promoting leaf development in arabidopsis. furthermore, it has been proposed that alterations in auxin gradients could result in a failure to down-regulate knox expression  <cit> . different epigenetic mechanisms have been suggested for the regulation of knox genes during organogenesis  <cit> . in this study, we showed that the atqknox <dig> gene is epigenetically regulated by h3k4me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> . histone modification is a very complex epigenetic mechanism that so far has not been decoded  <cit> . however, studies in arabidopsis have revealed that histone h3k <dig> methylation exists predominately as mono- and di-methylation, while trimethylation in h3k <dig> is quite rare  <cit> . there is evidence showing that in plants h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> are euchromatic marks, while h3k9me <dig> is more associated with the repression of the transcription  <cit> . chromatin changes have become an important key element for development in plants  <cit>  and histone modification is essential  <cit> . changes in knox <dig> gene expression among species could be due to different factors such as diversification of repressors of these genes  <cit> . among the main roles of knox are the formation of auxin maxima, which provide feedback to repress knox expression, allowing leaflet outgrowth  <cit> .

it will be interesting to study the methylation patterns from different generations exposed to in vitro conditions compared to those that were not, to determine whether the plants remember the in vitro exposure through epigenetic marks.

CONCLUSIONS
dna methylation and histone modifications are very important epigenetic mechanisms that can be affected by in vitro conditions. our studies indicate that under in vitro conditions, dna methylation is affected in a. angustifolia, but not in a. fourcroydes. in addition, a. fourcroydes presented differential expression of atqknox <dig> and atqknox <dig>  depending on the in vitro system used. furthermore, the regulatory expression of atqknox <dig> was related to the h3k4me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> marks. we propose that in vitro conditions change key genes by epigenetic regulation, which could be an important tool to find plants better adapted to overcome climate challenges.
