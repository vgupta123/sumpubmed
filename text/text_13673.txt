BACKGROUND
plant homoeodomain finger protein  <dig>  is highly expressed in circulating immune cells, with increased expression in t-helper  <dig>  t-cells relative to th <dig> t-cells  <cit> . knock-down of phf <dig> using small interfering rna  decreases expression of the interferon-γ  gene in th <dig> cells  <cit>  through a mechanism that involves a reduction in nfκb-dependent transcriptional activity  <cit> . a role for phf <dig> in ifng gene expression, and more recently the finding that phf <dig> increases class switch recombination to ige in murine b-cells  <cit> , supports a role for phf <dig> in allergic disease. a link between phf <dig> and allergic disease was shown in earlier genetic linkage and association studies , with alternate alleles of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3’ non-translated exon of phf <dig> associated with a change in the expression of this gene in th <dig> cells  <cit>  through differential binding of the transcription factor oct- <dig>  <cit> . although recent genome-wide association studies  of asthma and atopic dermatitis have not supported a genetic association between phf <dig> and allergy, it remains possible that there may be an association in selected cohorts of severely affected individuals who show a very early age of onset with highly elevated ige levels and who are more likely to require treatment by specialist clinicians  <cit> .

allergic asthma and dermatitis are characterized by immune sensitization, which refers to the initial recognition of an antigen by the immune system and the production of antigen-specific ige antibodies. in susceptible individuals any subsequent exposure to the same allergen will result in a robust and aggressive immune response. it is now apparent that there is a link between immune sensitization and the integrity of the skin barrier. as an example, filaggrin is a protein found in the outermost layer of the epidermis called the stratum corneum and is essential for the integrity of the skin barrier . mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin  are associated with immune sensitization in allergic dermatitis and asthma  <cit>  and these mutations cause an impairment of the skin barrier function  <cit> . genetic association between a locus containing the gene c11orf <dig> is highly reproduced in gwas of asthma and dermatitis , and although the functional relationship between c11orf <dig> or other nearby genes with asthma and dermatitis is not understood, the protein product of c11orf <dig>  is important in epithelial tumours of the breast and ovary  <cit> .

in addition to a genetic basis for a compromised skin barrier, elevated expression of th2-type cytokines such as interleukin - <dig> and il- <dig> in the skin of individuals with atopic dermatitis decreases filaggrin expression  <cit> . these cytokines also decrease the expression of the tight junction protein claudin- <dig> in the skin of individuals with atopic dermatitis  <cit> . the combination of genetic and inflammatory triggers that result in a decrease in the integrity of the skin barrier are also linked to the high rate of bacterial and viral skin infections of individuals with atopic dermatitis  <cit> . keratinocytes express several members of the toll-like receptor  family that are pattern recognition receptors for viral and bacterial pathogens. the tlr <dig> recognizes double-stranded rna that is a replication intermediate for a number of viruses, as well as rna that is released from damaged cells. activation of tlr <dig> is an important part of the keratinocyte innate immune response  <cit> , as well as the repair and maintenance of the skin barrier  <cit> .

a review of the literature revealed that phf <dig> is an interferon stimulated gene  and that its expression is increased following infection by several different viruses . although previous functional studies of phf <dig> have centered on its role in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in t-lymphocytes  <cit> , the susceptibility of individuals with atopic dermatitis to viral infection and the finding that phf <dig> is an isg has led us to test for phf <dig> expression in keratinocytes and whether its expression is regulated by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid ), a ligand for tlr <dig> and an analogue of double-stranded rna.

in this study we report that phf <dig> is expressed in the human hacat keratinocyte cell line and that treatment of this cell line with the double-stranded rna  analogue poly resulted in an increase in phf <dig> expression and the localization to the nucleus of the phf <dig> protein. furthermore, sirna knock-down of phf <dig> mrna resulted in a loss of phf <dig> from the nucleus and this was accompanied by an increase in il- <dig> expression, altered appearance of claudin- <dig> at the cell membrane and the appearance of claudin- <dig> in the nucleus. we suggest that in addition to its role in circulating t-cells, phf <dig> also plays a role in the innate immune response of keratinocytes and that a reduction in phf <dig> expression may contribute to inflammation and tissue remodeling following infection or tissue damage.

methods
cell culture
hacat keratinocytes were grown in a complete cell culture medium consisting of dulbecco’s modified eagle medium  and 10 % fetal bovine serum  at 37 °c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % co <dig>

sirna knockdown
all sirnas have been previously tested and validated  <cit> . the sequence of phf11-specific sirnas are: sirna sirna_ <dig> caccgtgggatgtgatttaaa  and sirna_ <dig> atcatcgctcaaagtgctaaa , mapping to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of phf <dig> isoform nm_ <dig> , respectively. on the day of transfection, hacat keratinocytes were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 1 ×  <dig> cells in 300 μl of complete cell culture media. 600 ng of sirna was diluted in 100 μl of optimem culture media , followed by the addition of 6 μl of hiperfect® transfection reagent . following a 10 min incubation at room temperature, the sirna mixture was combined with the hacat cells and plated directly onto 24-well plates  or an 8-well nunc® lab-tek® chamber slide  and incubated overnight at 37 °c/5%co <dig>  the transfection solution was then replaced with complete cell culture medium and the cells were returned to the incubator for a further 2 days, and then treated with poly for 24 h. cells were harvested either  <dig> or 96 h after treatment with poly.

hek cell transfection and phf <dig> expression plasmids
full-length phf <dig> cdna was cloned into the plasmid expression vector pegfp-c <dig>  and was then used as a template to generate the two c-terminal deletion constructs del <dig> and del <dig> that terminate at valine residue  <dig> and alanine residue  <dig>  respectively. numbering of amino acids is based on ncbi reference sequence np_ <dig> . transfection of hek cells was done as previously described  <cit> . identification of a putative nuclear localization sequence was done using the following online tool: http://nls-mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp/cgi-bin/nls_mapper_form.cgi. western blot analysis confirmed that each recombinant protein was expressed at the predicted molecular weight . images were analysed using imagej .

immunofluorescence
in experiments to visualize il- <dig> production,  <dig>  mm monensin sodium salt  was added to the culture media and cells returned to 37 °c/5%co <dig> for the final 4 h of stimulation by poly  <cit> . to visualize il- <dig>  as well as claudin- <dig> and phf <dig>  cells were fixed in a 4 % formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature, washed and permeabilized by washing for 3 × 5 min in pbs/ <dig>  % triton x <dig>  cells were then blocked in image-it™ fx signal enhancer  for 30 min and washed a further 3 × 5 min in pbs/ <dig>  % triton x <dig>  the cells were incubated with the following primary antibodies in blocking buffer  overnight at 4 °c: rabbit anti-claudin  <dig> , rabbit anti-phf <dig> , mouse anti-cxcl8/il- <dig> . cells were then washed for 3 × 5 min in pbs/ <dig>  % triton x <dig> and then incubated with a 1: <dig> dilution alexa flour®  <dig> goat anti-rabbit igg  and/or a 1: <dig> dilution of alexa flour®  <dig> goat anti-mouse igg   in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. cells were washed 2 × 5 min in pbs/ <dig>  % triton x <dig>  and nuclear dna was stained using a solution of 1 μg/ml hoechst  <dig>  for 10 min at room temperature protected from light. after a final 5 min wash in pbs/ <dig>  % triton x <dig>   <dig> drops of prolong® gold antifade reagent was added to the slide and covered with a glass cover slip. slides were viewed on an olympus bx <dig> microscope fitted with an x-cite series 120q exfo halogen lamp using cellsens standard software or using a tcs-sp <dig> confocal microscope .

il- <dig> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
cells were transfected with sirna as described and 1 ×  <dig> cells were plated per well in a 96-well plate in triplicate. following 24 h treatment with poly, the concentration of secreted il- <dig> was determined using the human cxcl8/il- <dig> quantikine elisa . the amount of secreted il- <dig> was normalized to cell number using the cyquant nf cell proliferation assay kit . results represent the outcome of  <dig> independent sirna transfections.

cell cycle analysis
at the conclusion of an experiment, cell culture media was removed and the cells harvested using trypsin. cells were washed once in 5 ml of pbs, and then resuspended and fixed in 5 ml of 70 %  ethanol  at 4 °c for up to 7 days. following fixation, cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for  <dig> mins at room temperature, washed in pbs, and then resuspended in a solution of 1 μl rnase, 2 μl 10x propidium iodine   in pbs and incubated at 37 °c for 50 min. cells were then collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature and the cell pellet resuspended in 1 ml of pbs. samples were analysed using a facscanto ii . ten thousand events were collected per sample and data was exported and analysed using flowjo flow cytometry analysis software  <dig> . <dig> . a scatterplot was created and the region containing the g <dig>  s and g2/m peaks was gated to select singlet cells. a histogram of the gated region was produced and live cells as well as sub-g <dig> cells were defined. cell cycle analysis was done using the dean-jett-fox model.

RESULTS
poly increased the expression and nuclear localization of phf11
the hacat cell line was used to test whether poly regulates the expression of phf <dig> in keratinocytes. the induction of interferon signaling by poly-dependent activation of toll-like receptor  <dig>  has previously been reported in this cell line  <cit> . since poly is able to activate innate immune signaling pathways as well as induce apoptosis  <cit> , we were interested in examining the regulation of phf <dig> to poly at  <dig> and 3 days after the commencement of treatment.

to do this, hacat keratinocytes were cultured for 3 days to reach a confluent monolayer and then treated for 24-h with poly. cells were either analyzed immediately  or poly was removed and cells cultured for a further 3 days, making a total of 7 days in culture .fig.  <dig> summary of sirna transfection and culturing of hacat keratinocytes. cells were cultured for up to 7 days, with poly treatment commencing on day  <dig> of culture for 24 h. cells were analyzed immediately after treatment, or were washed and cultured for a further 3 days. transfection with sirna was done on the day of plating



analysis of gene expression 24 h after commencing treatment with 1 μg/ml of poly showed an approximately 4-fold increase in phf <dig> rna , 4 days in culture) relative to untreated cultures. three days after withdrawal of poly, expression of phf <dig> had declined to be no different from cultures not treated with poly , 7 days in culture). there was no change in the expression of rna encoding the tight junction marker claudin- <dig>  between different treatment conditions . to confirm that the cells had responded to poly, we also analyzed the expression of genes encoding interleukin - <dig> and isg <dig>  both of which are regulated by poly  <cit> . analysis of rna expression immediately after 24 h of treatment with poly showed il <dig> was increased by more than 140-fold while isg <dig> expression was increased approximately 20-fold , 4 days in culture). analysis of rna expression three days after withdrawal of poly showed isg <dig> expression had declined to levels not different from untreated cultures, while il <dig> rna remained approximately 50-fold higher than that seen in untreated controls .fig.  <dig> profile of gene expression in hacat keratinocytes in response to poly at  <dig> and 7 days in culture. cells were left untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml of poly on day  <dig> and harvested on day  <dig> or on day  <dig>  quantitative real-time pcr was used to analyse the expression of phf <dig>  claudin- <dig> , il- <dig> , interferon-stimulated gene  <dig>  and keratins  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> . results represent  <dig> independent experiments. bars indicate average ± standard deviation, asterisks indicate significant difference relative to control 



as the activation of tlr <dig> can promote skin barrier repair  <cit> , we also looked for changes in the expression of keratin genes that are normally active in undifferentiated keratinocytes  or in keratinocytes during early differentiation . after 3 days in culture, treatment for 24 h with poly did not change the expression of keratin- <dig>  although the expression of both keratin- <dig> and − <dig> were decreased  <dig>  to 3-fold under the same conditions . assaying the expression of each keratin gene three days after the withdrawal of poly revealed a significant decrease in the expression of keratin- <dig>  independently of poly treatment , whereas the expression of keratin- <dig> and keratin- <dig> were either not different from untreated controls or showed only a small increase in expression, respectively .

we have previously shown that in jurkat t-cells phf <dig> localization is mainly cytoplasmic, although stimulation with pma/ionomycin increases the amount of phf <dig> in the nucleus  <cit> . in hacat keratinocytes, nuclear localization of phf <dig> was strongly increased following a 24 h incubation with poly . three days after withdrawal of poly the nuclear localization of phf <dig> had decreased and, similar to untreated cultures, showed strong cytoplasmic localization . the distribution of phf <dig> in the nucleus had a highly speckled or punctate appearance and differed from nuclear distribution of nf-κb .fig.  <dig> nuclear localization of phf <dig> is induced by poly. a confocal microscopy of phf <dig> localization in hacat keratinocytes on day  <dig> of culture in the absence of poly , or after a 24-h poly treatment ). b higher magnification image of the nuclei of cells treated with poly and stained for phf <dig> , nf-κb . a merged image of phf <dig> and nf-κb , as well as dapi-stained nuclei  is shown



the stimulus-dependent nuclear localization of phf <dig> led us to search for sequences that control its cellular localization. to do this, we first searched for possible nuclear localization sequences  using an online mapping tool   <cit> . this identified a putative monopartite nls beginning at residue  <dig> and consisting of the sequence sgvkrkrgrk . next, full-length phf <dig> as well as two c-terminal deletion mutants that terminate at amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  were cloned into a green fluorescent protein  expression vector. transfection of human embryonic kidney  cells showed that the expressed full-length protein was present in the cytoplasm, as well as in a speckled pattern in the nucleus . deletion to amino acid  <dig>  which retained both the phd domain as well as the putative nls, resulted in nuclear localization . however, the phf <dig> deletion mutant that terminated at residue  <dig> and lacked the putative nls also showed strong nuclear localization . these results showed that the deletion of sequences in the c-terminal half of phf <dig> between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  but not of a sequence rich in basic residues located between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  resulted in nuclear localization of phf <dig> fig.  <dig> c-terminal deletion mutants of phf <dig> are localized in the nucleus. a the amino acid sequence of phf <dig> showing the phd domain , predicted nuclear localization sequence  and the location of the c-terminal deletion mutants del <dig>  and del <dig>  . b

sirna knock-down of phf11: analysis immediately after poly treatment
to explore the role of phf <dig> in keratinocytes, hacat cells were treated with sirna that has previously been used to successfully knock-down phf <dig> expression in t-cells  <cit> . in hacat cells transfected with a control sirna and treated with poly, phf <dig> immunoreactivity was clearly visible in nuclei after 24 h of treatment with poly . under the same conditions, transfection of hacat cells with phf11-specific sirna resulted in a loss of nuclear phf <dig> . western blot analysis detected an approximately 40 kda phf11-specific band in control sirna transfected nuclei that increased following treatment with poly  two phf11-specific sirnas  were equally efficient at knocking-down phf <dig> when transfected singly or in combination . all sirna experiments described in this paper use the combination of phf11-specific sirna  <dig> and  <dig> fig.  <dig> sirna knock-down of phf <dig> decreases nuclear phf <dig> in poly treated cells. cells were transfected with control  or phf11-specific  sirna  and then treated with 1 μg/ml of poly  for 24 h. a. image of transfected cells showing an absence of phf <dig> in cell nuclei. arrows indicate the location of nuclei with reduced phf <dig>  green: phf11; blue: nuclei. scale bar 10 μm. b. western blot showing knock-down of phf <dig> in nuclear lysates in the absence and presence of phf <dig>  shown are the results for control  and two different phf11-specific sirnas either singly  or in combination 



we next examined the expression and localization of the tight junction marker claudin- <dig> in sirna-transfected cells. in cells transfected with control sirna and cultured for a total of 4 days but not treated with poly, claudin- <dig> immuno-reactivity was visible at the membrane with some cells displaying intense intracellular claudin- <dig> immuno-reactivity . treatment with poly resulted in increased intracellular claudin- <dig>  as well as the appearance of claudin- <dig> in the nucleus ). in parallel cultures transfected with phf11-specific sirna but not treated with poly, there was an increase in intracellular claudin- <dig> as well as evidence of nuclear claudin- <dig> . treatment of cells transfected with phf11-specific sirna with poly reduced membrane claudin- <dig> and increased the number of cells displaying intracellular claudin- <dig> immuno-reactivity ).fig.  <dig> knock-down of phf <dig> increases nuclear claudin- <dig>  cells were transfected with either: a. control  or b. a mixture of phf <dig> sirna_ <dig> &  <dig>  and left untreated or treated on day  <dig> with  <dig> mg/ml poly for  <dig> h and analyzed immediately thereafter. shown are representative images of claudin- <dig> and nuclei  or claudin- <dig> only  from one of three independent experiments. green: claudin-1; blue: nuclei. arrows indicate nuclear claudin- <dig>  scale bar  <dig> mm



assaying poly-dependent gene expression showed there was no difference in the expression of isg <dig> between cells transfected with either control or phf11-specific sirna and this was independent of treatment with poly . however, knock-down of phf <dig> expression resulted in an approximately 2-fold greater increase in poly-dependent il <dig> expression 24 h after adding poly , relative to cells transfected with control sirna. the expression of il- <dig> in cells transfected with control or phf11-specific sirna was next assayed by immuno-fluorescent imaging of monensin-treated cells and by quantitative elisa. analysis of fixed, monensin-treated cells revealed a significant increase in il <dig> immunoreactivity in cells transfected with phf11-specific sirna . quantitative elisa analysis of il- <dig> secretion from sirna-transfected hacat cells showed knock-down of phf <dig> resulted in a significant  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold increase in il- <dig> secretion at 1 μg/ml of poly . knock-down of phf <dig> also resulted in a non-significant  <dig> -fold increase in secretion of il- <dig> in hacat cells treated with 10 μg/ml of poly, relative to control sirna .fig.  <dig> knock-down of phf <dig> expression increases il- <dig> expression immediately after treatment with poly. a quantitative real-time pcr analysis of il <dig> rna in cells transfected with control  or phf11-specific  sirna. results are normalized to untreated cells transfected with control sirna. b immunohistochemistry of il- <dig> synthesis. red: il-8; blue: nuclei. quantification of il- <dig> positive nuclei is shown on the right. asterisks indicate significant difference relative to control . c elisa quantification of il- <dig> secretion from sirna-transfected hacat cells. cells were transfected with control  or phf11-specific sirna  and then treated with poly  for 24 h prior to assaying for secreted il- <dig>  results represent  <dig> independent experiments; asterisks indicate significant differences . scale bar 20 μm



sirna knock-down of phf11: analysis 3 days after poly treatment
we first ascertained whether any differences could be detected in phf <dig> expression between cells transfected with control and phf11-specific sirna at day  <dig> in culture ). in cells that had been transfected with control sirna, nuclear accumulation of phf <dig> was still evident against a background of phf <dig> expression . in contrast, cells that had been transfected with phf11-specific sirna show a uniform level of phf <dig> expression with no evidence of concentration in the nucleus .fig.  <dig> phf <dig> expression in sirna-transfected cells on day  <dig> of culture, 3 days after withdrawal of poly. left panels: cells transfected with control sirna; right panels: cells transfected with phf11-specific sirna. green: phf11; blue: nuclei. scale bar 20 μm



after 7 days in culture, claudin- <dig> immunoreactivity was clearly visible at the cell membrane of cells transfected with control sirna with this distribution independent of prior treatment with poly . knock-down of phf <dig> rna resulted in decreased cell density and increased cell size while claudin- <dig> immuno-reactivity at the membrane exhibited a more irregular appearance when compared to cells transfected with control sirna . both effects were independent of prior treatment with poly . nuclear claudin- <dig> immunoreactivity was also observed in cells transfected with phf11-specific sirna with nuclear claudin- <dig> was observed more frequently in cells treated with poly . no difference in the expression of il- <dig> was observed between control and phf11-specific sirna 3 days after the withdrawal of poly .fig.  <dig> distribution of claudin- <dig> in sirna transfected cells after 7 days in culture. cells were transfected with control or phf11-specific sirna as already described, treated with poly and analyzed 3 days thereafter . enlarged images of the boxed areas are shown on the right of the figure and nuclei showing claudin- <dig> immuno-reactivity are indicated by asterisks. shown are representative images of three independent experiments. green: claudin-1; blue: nuclei. scale bar 20 μm



an analysis of cell number in cultures transfected with control or phf11-specific sirna, and treated or not treated with poly, showed no difference in cell numbers on day  <dig> of culture . however, relative to day  <dig>  on day  <dig> of culture there was a greater than  <dig> -fold increase in cell number for cultures transfected with control sirna but not treated with poly, with a smaller  <dig> -fold increase in cell number when treated with poly . in contrast, for cultures transfected with phf11-specific sirna there was no significant increase in cell number, irrespective of treatment with poly . to investigate this further, we next analyzed the cell cycle distribution of cells transfected with control or phf11-specific sirna.fig.  <dig> knock-down of phf <dig> expression decreases cell number and the proportion of cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle on day  <dig> of culture. a cell number normalized to untreated cultures on day  <dig>  b cell cycle analysis of sirna transfected cells in the treated or untreated with poly on day  <dig> or  <dig> of culture. con: control sirna; phf11: phf11-specific sirna. results are from  <dig> independent experiments and show average ± standard deviation, asterisks indicate significant difference relative to control 



after 4 days in culture there was no difference in the cell cycle distribution of cells transfected with either control or phf11-specific sirna or between cultures treated or not treated with poly . after 7 days in culture there was an increase in the percent of cells in g <dig> phase in cells transfected with control sirna that was independent of poly treatment ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  vs  <dig>  ± 3; 1 μg/ml poly,  <dig>  ±  <dig> vs  <dig>  ± 1). in contrast, transfection with phf11-specific sirna resulted in significantly fewer cells in g <dig> after 7 days in culture in culture not treated or treated with poly ,  <dig>  ± 2; 1 μg/ml poly,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ).

discussion
extending on our previous work showing increased nuclear localization of phf <dig> in activated t-cells  <cit> , we show here that stimulation of hacat keratinocytes by poly increased phf <dig> rna as well as the nuclear localization of phf <dig>  the distribution of phf <dig> between the cytoplasm and the nucleus was dependent upon a region that included a putative nls that was distinct from the single phd finger. knock-down of phf <dig> led to an increase in il- <dig> expression immediately following poly treatment. a decrease in cell number, redistribution of claudin- <dig> within the cell membrane and an increased frequency of claudin- <dig> in the nucleus was seen three days after the withdrawal of poly.

in the hacat cell line, poly induces apoptosis in a caspase- <dig> dependent manner  <cit> , as well as inducing the transcription and synthesis of il- <dig>  <cit> . normal keratinocytes and the hacat cell line synthesize il- <dig> and express the il- <dig> receptors cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  <cit> , allowing il- <dig> to act as an autocrine factor for keratinocyte migration and proliferation  <cit> , in addition to promoting the recruitment of neutrophils to a wound site  <cit> . the binding of dsrna to tlr <dig> on keratinocytes initiates signaling pathways that include the activation of the nf-κb transcription factor as well as anti-viral interferon-dependent pathways. the cellular response to intracellular influenza a virus and extracellular poly is very similar in lung epithelial cells, although adding poly directly to the cell culture media, as was done in the study reported here, may also mimic the release endogenous cellular or viral dsrna from damaged cells and the activation of tlr <dig>  <cit> .

consistent with a pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic role for poly on cultured keratinocytes, poly treatment leads to the loss of tight junctions from airway epithelial cells  <cit> . however, poly also increases the expression of genes involved in skin barrier formation in cultured keratinocytes  <cit> , while topical application of poly accelerates wound healing in mice through the production of cxcl <dig> and the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the wounded site  <cit> . given the range of these effects and their importance to epithelial damage and repair, it is important to identify genes involved in tlr3-dependent signaling pathways that mediate the response to poly.

in experiments described here, hacat cells were transfected with sirna and then two days later treated with poly for 24 h, with knock-down of phf <dig> expression correlated with an increase in poly-dependent il- <dig> expression. three days after withdrawal of poly we observed marked differences in the appearance of cultures transfected with control or phf11-specific sirna. the distribution of membrane-localized claudin- <dig> in cells transfected with phf11-specific sirna was discontinuous and irregular and was highly reminiscent of the “zigzag” structure of tight junctions described at the junction of two motile cells by matsuda and co-workers  <cit> . we also noted the appearance of nuclear claudin- <dig>  accompanied by a significant decrease in both cell number and the proportion of cells in g <dig>  as well as an increase in nuclear and cytoplasmic volume that is a feature of the progression of cells through the cell cycle  <cit> . significantly, neither the change in claudin- <dig> distribution, nor the decrease in cell number seen in cells transfected with phf11-specific sirna was dependent on prior treatment with poly.

colon carcinoma cells show an increase in the cytoplasmic expression and nuclear localization of claudin- <dig> in primary tumours and metastases and knock-down of claudin- <dig> expression in cultured cell lines inhibits cell migration  <cit> . several other membrane and tight-junction proteins also traffic between the membrane and the nucleus; the protein zona occludens  <dig>  interacts with several transcription factors and structural proteins in the nucleus to regulate cell growth and proliferation . the exact role of claudin- <dig> in the nucleus is not known. we suggest that the change in cellular distribution of claudin- <dig> in hacat cells transfected with phf11-specific sirna might not be a direct effect of phf <dig> knock-down, but is instead a result of differences in cell proliferation between cells transfected with control or phf11-specific sirna.

a genome-wide screen using rna-interference gene knock-down was recently carried out in mice to identify genes involved in normal and oncogenic growth during skin development. this analysis identified phf <dig> as one of  <dig> genes considered essential for normal growth  <cit> . it is interesting to note that an allele in the 3’ untranslated region of phf <dig> that is associated with asthma and dermatitis  <cit>  reduces the expression of phf <dig>  <cit>  and that this is correlated with reduced binding of the transcription factor oct- <dig>  <cit> , which is highly expressed in epithelial cells. in experiments described here, we suggest that sirna knock-down of phf <dig> expression led to a reduction in cell viability  <cit>  and/or a slowing of cell proliferation that resulted in a sub-confluent monolayer at day  <dig> of culture, resulting in fewer cells arrested at g <dig> in the cell cycle at his time point.

in t-cells, phf <dig> is a transcriptional co-activator of nf-κb, with knock-down of phf <dig> associated with decreased binding of nf-κb to the ifng promoter and decreased nf-κb-dependent transcription  <cit> . over-expression of phf <dig> increased class-switch recombination to ige in activated b-cells and this was correlated with increased binding of nf-κb  <cit> . epidermal inflammation is regulated by nf-κb-dependent cross-talk between keratinocytes and infiltrating immune cells, while epidermal hyperplasia can be induced by dysregulation of nf-κb in keratinocytes alone  <cit> . it has been shown that nf-κb is constitutively active in hacat keratinocytes, resulting in increased apoptosis in response to ultraviolet light  <cit> . despite the constitutive activation of nf-κb in hacats, the sensitivity of this cell line to apoptotic stimuli is thought to reflect low nf-κb transcriptional activation  <cit> . as phf <dig> potentiates nf-κb regulated transcription in lymphocytes  <cit> , the reason for the increase in il <dig> rna associated with knock-down of phf <dig> in hacat cells is less clear, given that il <dig> expression is increased in hacat keratinocytes through an nf-κb-dependent pathway  <cit> . significantly, a microarray analysis of poly-stimulated thp- <dig> monocytes also showed an increase in il <dig> rna following phf <dig> knock-down , supporting the idea that phf <dig> may be a negative regulator of poly-induced il <dig> expression.

in this regard it is interesting to note that phf <dig> is adjacent to the gene setdb <dig> that encodes a histone methyltransferase that increases histone methylation on lysine  <dig> of histone  <dig>  <cit> , a histone modification involved in gene repression. a co-transcript that may express a phf11/setdb <dig> fusion protein has been reported in mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  cells. we are currently investigating whether epithelial cells express such a transcript and whether this transcript would include a functional histone methyltransferase domain.

CONCLUSIONS
this report describes the regulation of phf <dig> by poly in the hacat keratinocyte cell line and is consistent with other reports showing phf <dig> is an interferon stimulated gene that is induced by viral infection. given that the knock-down of phf <dig> expression in hacat keratinocytes led to an increase in il- <dig> expression immediately after poly treatment whereas the change in cell number and the cellular distribution of claudin- <dig> occurred later and were independent of poly, phf <dig> may have several roles in the epithelial response to infection and injury.
