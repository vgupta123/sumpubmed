BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cilia and flagella are critical for diverse functions, from motility to signal transduction. it is generally accepted that the last eukaryotic common ancestor  was flagellate  <cit> . there have been numerous modifications to, and even loss of, cilia in certain lineages such as yeasts and higher plants; however, most of the extant eukaryotic supergroups contain ciliated members. the underlying ultrastructure of cilia/flagella are highly conserved; further, while cilia are made up of hundreds of proteins, many are conserved across eukaryotes  <cit> .

in humans, ciliary dysfunction causes inherited diseases, termed ciliopathies, characterised by aberrant embryonic development typically leading to cystic renal disease and malformations of the skeleton and/or central nervous system  <cit> . many of the ciliopathy phenotypes have been linked to perturbation of cell signalling pathways during development, in particular the hedgehog  and wnt developmental signalling pathways. cilia are required for hh signalling in vertebrates , while the role of cilia in wnt signalling is less well understood  <cit> .

this requirement for cilia in developmental signalling highlights the importance of compartmentalisation in ciliary function. unlike most organelles, the cilium is not completely membrane-bound; despite this, the composition of the ciliary membrane is distinct from that of the cell membrane  <cit> . passage of signalling intermediates between the ciliary compartment and the cytoplasm is key to ciliary signalling, particularly hh  <cit> . however, until very recently, the molecular mechanisms governing this compartmentalisation have remained unknown.

several recent studies have implicated a number of mechanisms in formation of a ciliary ‘gate’ which controls entry and exit of proteins from the cilium, including a septin barrier  <cit> , a nuclear pore-like mechanism , and retention of proteins via the apical actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . several studies have highlighted complexes consisting largely of ciliopathy proteins which appear to be key in maintaining ciliary compartmentalisation . these complexes localise to the ciliary transition zone , which is found distal to the basal body and, in motile cilia/flagella, ends at the basal plate where the central pair microtubules are nucleated . this region is characterised by projections  connecting the microtubule doublets to the ciliary membrane.figure  <dig>

the original studies identified separate but overlapping complexes localising to the tz, disruption of which causes changes to ciliary permeability . the current model proposes two modules; the mks/tctn/b <dig> complex and the nphp complex  <cit> , which are linked in c. elegans by rpgrip1l  <cit> . given that several of these proteins contain transmembrane domains, and that disruption of tz complex proteins often causes loss of ciliary y-links  <cit> , the model also suggests that tz complex proteins may make up the y-links connecting the axonemal doublets to the membrane  <cit> .

however, as each of the studies found different components to the complexes, there is no consensus on the exact composition of each complex, their formation, the contribution of each component, or their mechanism of function as ciliary gatekeepers. one possible explanation for this may be tissue- or organism-specific variation in tz complex composition. while these complexes have been studied in different model organisms, the presence or absence of each gene in each model organism has not been examined. therefore we set out to provide a detailed examination of the evolutionary patterns of these genes. we present here a comprehensive analysis of presence/absence of  <dig> tz complex proteins across  <dig> eukaryotic organisms, both ciliated and non-ciliated, and identify  <dig> proteins which are almost ubiquitously present in ciliated eukaryotes and which may represent the core of a dynamic tz complex.

RESULTS
thus far,  <dig> proteins have been identified biochemically as part of protein complexes which maintain ciliary compartmentalisation, though the exact constituents of these complexes in different model systems has not been elucidated and there may well be other components yet to be identified. to identify the complement of tz complex proteins in different eukaryotes, we carried out a bioinformatic survey of  <dig> proteins in  <dig> organisms, including representatives from all six eukaryotic supergroups  <cit> . full results, including accession numbers and e-values, can be found in additional file  <dig> and these results are summarised in additional file  <dig>  in common with centriolar proteins  <cit> , we found considerable diversity in the conservation of tz components across eukaryotes . all  <dig> proteins were restricted to eukaryotes which build cilia and flagella . however, the majority of the tz proteins had a widespread evolutionary distribution, with the exception of nphp <dig>  nphp5/iqcb <dig> and tmem <dig> which were restricted to opisthokonts . tmem <dig> and nphp <dig> are notable in that they were not found outside of metazoan organisms, suggesting they may have evolved concomitant with multicellularity.figure  <dig>

only  <dig> tz proteins are conserved across the majority of ciliated eukaryotes
we identified a core group of  <dig> proteins, consisting of tmem <dig>  cc2d2a, b9d <dig>  b9d <dig>  ahi <dig>  and a single tctn family member, which are present in >50% of all ciliate/flagellate organisms analysed in each supergroup . this suggests that these six proteins are likely to have critical conserved functions. all are implicated in meckel-gruber and/or joubert syndromes , two severe ciliopathies, highlighting their importance for cilium function. a 7th protein, mks <dig>  is present in >50% of five of the six supergroups and is only absent from rhizaria; this supergroup is currently represented by a single sequenced genome in this analysis, and as more genomes become available it may become apparent that mks <dig> is also core.

all six of these core proteins belong to the larger of the two known tz complexes, the mks/b9/tctn complex  <cit> . our analysis indicates that while proteins belonging to the mks complex are consistently found across the six eukaryotic supergroups, proteins which form the nphp complex  evolved later. nphp <dig> is the most prevalent, but is missing from the excavata. however, the restriction of nphp <dig> and nphp5/iqcb <dig> to the opithokonts suggests that the mks complex initially existed alone and that the nphp complex evolved later, perhaps in concordance with increasing complexity or the need for redundancy. as such, a single complex containing nphp <dig> may exist outside the opisthokonts, or nphp <dig> may have other functions. this may explain why rpgrip1lis not one of the core conserved proteins; studies in c. elegans have shown that, in this organism at least, the two complexes are redundant with rpgrip1l the only protein which causes significant ciliary dysfunction upon abrogation  <cit> . generally, rpgrip1l is only present together with at least one component of the nphp module, usually nphp4; the exception is the insects, where  <dig> of the  <dig> organisms examined  have an rpgrip1l orthologue but lack any apparent constituents of the nphp complex. this implies that the mks module may be able to assemble in the absence of rpgrip1l, but the nphp module cannot.

organisms lacking tz complex components have unusual ciliary biology
intriguingly, our analysis shows that several ciliated organisms – giardia intestinalis, plasmodium falciparum, toxoplasma gondii, physcomitrella patens and selaginella moellendorffii – apparently lack all  of the known tz complex proteins. there are several unusual aspects to the ciliary biology in these particular organisms which might indicate that they have evolved alternative mechanisms of maintaining ciliary compartmentalisation, or indeed do not require a traditional separation of the ciliary compartment; in many, ultrastructural studies have not yet confirmed whether a tz is present. unlike most other organisms, the proximal region of the giardia flagellum is found within the cytoplasm and is not membrane-bound; ift particles are thought to dock directly onto the sides of the exposed microtubules within the cytoplasm rather than being restricted to the ciliary base as in other model organisms  <cit> . it is unclear whether the giardia flagellum contains a tz region at all, and y-links have neither been observed ultrastructurally nor would be expected without a surrounding membrane. giardia may therefore have evolved specific mechanisms to maintain ciliary compartmentalisation. the apicomplexa  also lack tz components; this may correlate with a lack of several centriolar proteins in these organisms  <cit> . plasmodium species lack ift components in their predicted proteome  <cit>  and therefore build their flagella intracellularly by ift-independent mechanisms and then extrude them from the cell  <cit> . further, flagella in these organisms are restricted to the short-lived male gamete and the presence of a tz with or without y-links has not been confirmed. in contrast, several ift components have been identified in the proteome of the apicomplexan toxoplasma
 <cit> , which likewise builds flagella only in the male gamete  <cit> ; this may correlate with the presence of a single tz protein  in this organism, though the flagellar biology of toxoplasma has likewise been little studied and thus the relevance of this finding remains to be elucidated. it may be that apicomplexa have evolved specific mechanisms to maintain compartmentalisation or, given the fleeting nature of their flagella, do not require strict ciliary compartmentalisation. given the hypothesis that the conoid complex of apicomplexa may have evolved from flagellar components  <cit> , b9d <dig> may have adapted to function in this region.

non-seed land plants lack tz complex proteins and have no y-links
in contrast, the flagella of the non-seed land plants have been characterised in detail  and contain a classical tz. we therefore examined the ultrastructure of the tz of the selaginella gamete and representatives of five major clades of non-seed land plants . the gross ultrastructure of the tz in the flagellate sperm of these organisms appeared normal, containing a ring of outer doublet microtubules and the typical stellate pattern also seen in the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas and other plants with motile sperm  <cit> . however, unlike the mammalian motile cilia and trypanosome flagellum which have prominent y-links, we could see no evidence of any structures linking the outer doublet microtubules to the ciliary membrane . since the non-seed land plants also lack a number of components of both the ift-b and bbsome protein groups previously thought to be essential for proper function and compartmentalisation of the eukaryotic cilium  <cit> , this raises questions about the precise nature of the motile cilium in these organisms.

previous studies have shown that disruption of tz complexes causes loss of y-links and/or changes in microxtubule-membrane linkage  <cit> ; as such, the correlation between absence of both tz complex proteins and ciliary y-links in the non-seed land plants is consistent with the theory that the tz complex proteins are involved in the formation of y-links  <cit> . disruption of several tz complex components affects y-link formation  <cit> , though as yet, cep <dig> is the only protein implicated in y-link formation that is known to localise specifically to the region between the microtubule doublets and the ciliary membrane  <cit> . in common with another study  <cit> , our analysis failed to find evidence of a cep <dig> homologue in several organisms, including the model organisms caenorhabditis elegans and trypanosoma brucei. comparative search methods rely on sequence similarity; it is impossible, by these methods, to distinguish between absence of a protein and divergence of that protein to beyond the threshold of detection. in particular, the cep <dig> protein sequence consists almost entirely of low-complexity coiled-coil motifs, which confounds sequence comparison methods by producing large numbers of spurious hits against other coiled-coil proteins. attempts to optimise specificity by further editing the cep <dig> protein alignment failed to produce significant improvements in homologue identification. as such, it is likely that additional cep <dig> homologues exist beyond those identified here.

tz complexes and developmental signalling in animals
while current evidence suggests that tz complexes are essential to ciliary biology, a role supported by the lack of tz complex components in non-ciliated organisms and their ubiquity in ciliates, their presence in a specific organism is no guarantee of a role in tz complexes. recent studies suggest that tz complex proteins may function outside of the cilium itself, such as in cytoskeletal organisation  <cit>  and epithelial morphogenesis  <cit> ; further, there is increasing evidence that many ciliopathy proteins may have extra-ciliary roles e.g. . due to the preponderance of phenotypes caused by dysregulation of hh and wnt signalling pathways in both model organisms and patients, many studies of ciliopathy proteins have focused on their impact on metazoan developmental signalling pathways. disruption of several tz complex proteins leads to significant effects on signalling pathways, such as wnt signalling in the case of tmem67/tmem216/tmem <dig> . by examining the evolutionary patterns of these groups of proteins, we can gain better understanding of their possible functions. for example, tmem <dig> has been proposed to be a receptor in the wnt signalling pathway  <cit> , with tmem <dig> and tmem <dig> acting as modifiers to its function in this regard  <cit> . our data indicate that tmem <dig> is one of the core six proteins found across the majority of ciliated eukaryotes, while tmem <dig> is less frequently found. therefore tmem <dig> likely evolved prior to tmem <dig> and, at least originally, functioned without it. further, tmem <dig> is found only in the metazoa, suggesting that it may have evolved as an additional regulator of tmem <dig> concomitant with multicellularity.

it is also important to note that both classical hh and wnt signalling are restricted largely to metazoan organisms  <cit> , though there is evidence of a primitive form of wnt signalling in the amoebozoa  <cit> . in contrast, tz complex proteins are found throughout eukaryotic evolution. this supports the theory that they may impact upon developmental signalling pathways indirectly by affecting ciliary permeability, preventing the correct passage of signalling intermediates between the ciliary and cytoplasmic compartments. the sheer diversity of tz complex proteins in metazoa suggests that these proteins may have diversified in function, but the absence of any tz complex proteins in non-ciliates implies that the ancestral role of these proteins was ciliary.

CONCLUSIONS
with all of this in mind, there may be a minimal set of proteins required to correctly compartmentalise the cilium. we would predict, based on the domain architecture of the core  <dig> proteins  <cit> , that the b <dig> domain has a critical function, and that membrane anchoring via tmem and c <dig> domains is key. how this is then connected to the microtubules is not clear, but several tz complex proteins localise to the centrosome in non-ciliated cells e.g. . given the near-ubiquity of tmem <dig>  cc2d2a, b9d <dig>  b9d <dig>  ahi <dig>  a single tctn family member, and possibly mks <dig> across ciliated eukaryotes, we suggest a dynamic complex built around these proteins and varying in a spatio-temporal and/or organism/tissue-specific manner. in concordance with current ideas  <cit> , formation of this complex is likely to be key in the proper formation and functioning of ciliary y-links. to further examine the relationships between these complexes and their constituent protein members, it will be important to fully integrate metazoan models with single-celled organisms to properly examine the molecular nature of complex formation and to properly disentangle effects on ciliary compartmentalisation from the potentially diverse effects caused by changes in developmental signalling pathways and non-ciliary roles. by clarifying the evolutionary relationships between tz complex proteins and the protein complements of various model organisms, we hope to provide a valuable tool in the understanding how these complexes might work in different organisms and tissues essential to both basic cilium and ciliopathy research.
