BACKGROUND
the lipocalins constitute a group of small  mostly extracellular proteins which are highly stable, functionally versatile and widely distributed within different biological kingdoms. the lipocalins belong to the calcyin superfamily, along with fatty acid binding proteins , avidins, metallo-protease inhibitors and triabins. in contrast to their poor sequence similarity , lipocalins share a highly conserved three dimensional structure. the so-called 'lipocalin fold' comprises a stable calyx-shaped eight-stranded β-barrel scaffold, flanked by a c-terminal α-helix. the space between the two β-sheets of the barrel defines an internal apolar binding cavity with high structural plasticity, consisting of four structurally hypervariable peptide loops, mounted on the barrel. these are divided into two groups according to the presence of three structurally conserved regions . the core set of lipocalins called kernel lipocalins share the three scrs and are more closely related. the more divergent, outlier lipocalins, share only one or two scrs  <cit> .

though first identified for their ability to transport small hydrophobic molecules like steroids, bilins, fatty acids etc., it is now established that the functional repertoire of lipocalins encompasses regulation of immunological  and developmental processes, enzymatic  activities, as for uterocalin, metabolic homeostasis  <cit> , etc. the lipocalins are implicated in various environmental stress responses , allergies, as candidate markers of kidney function  <cit> , and acute phase response of inflammation  <cit> . the lipocalins are also known to interact with membranes.

the flexibility of lipocalin ligand binding pocket has invigorated greater interest in lipocalins, with pieris ag, germany now developing artificial lipocalins having novel binding specificities, denominated as anticalins  <cit> . anticalins offer a far more lucrative technology over the conventional antibodies as promising reagents for research, biotechnology and therapeutic applications.

in the light of ever increasing wealth of genomic data and the burgeoning interest in lipocalins, it becomes important to have facile methods of lipocalin identification. prediction of few well characterized lipocalin family members is missed by the prosite, pfam signatures  as well as position-specific iterative-basic local alignment search tool   <cit>  searches . easy and reliable identification of lipocalins remains an arduous task, attributable to extreme sequence diversity amongst lipocalins. crystallization and structure solution remain the only certain ways of identification of novel lipocalin family members  <cit>  and indeed, a number of crystal structures have been solved for lipocalins. experimental determination, however requires expensive infrastructure, and is labour- and time-intensive. computational structure determination methods like homology modelling and threading, offer an easier alternative and have been used as in the case of apolipoprotein m  <cit> . another recent improvement to such methods for recognizing distantly related members, involves the identification of crucial interactions involving two conserved clusters of hydrophobic residues  <cit> . but these methods are fraught with complications first in their own right and secondly due to the difficulty in selecting the template for modelling, since the minimum similarity for reliable modelling is 30%  <cit> .

machine learning techniques present an alternative, reliable and faster solution for such problems. first pioneered by vapnik in  <dig>  support vector machine  is one such supervised learning algorithm which delivers state-of-the-art performance in recognition and discrimination of cryptic patterns in complex datasets  <cit> . svms are used in conjunction with kernel functions which implicitly map input data to high dimensional non-linear feature space. svms construct a large margin hyperplane separating the training data in this space with the aim of achieving minimum classification error  <cit> . apart from the classical kernels-linear, polynomial, rbf and gaussian kernels, there exist variety of sequence-specific string kernels  <cit> . svms premised on a strong theoretical underpinning  <cit>  have been used extensively across a growing spectrum of applications in computational biology because of their ability to deal with high-dimensional, large and diverse types of datasets as well as to effectively handle noise  <cit> . svm-based prediction methods have been successfully employed for a legion of biological problems, including identification of dna and rna binding proteins  <cit> , post-translational modifications in proteins  <cit> , automated classification of microarray gene expression profiles  <cit> , etc. in the present study, we developed a svm-based method to facilitate the prediction of members of lipocalin family. apart from composition-based features, that is amino acid composition , dipeptide composition  and secondary structure composition  obtained from protein structure prediction   <cit> , we used the position-specific scoring matrix  profiles obtained from psi-blast for training the svm models.

given the mounting interest and biotechnological applications of lipocalins, we hope this would be a useful tool to the end-user biologist and the research community as a whole.

RESULTS
algorithm
performance of similarity-based searches
we carried out psi-blast analysis on the non-redundant positive dataset in a fashion similar to the loo cv , with the default values of e as  <dig>  and the number of iterations as  <dig>  each sequence served as the query sequence once while the remaining formed the database, with the procedure iterating on each sequence. herein, no significant hits were obtained for  <dig> sequences; thereby reinforcing that even remote similarity based searches may miss out some of the positive hits i.e. lipocalins.

with the tremendous increase in the number of sequences accumulating from different sequencing projects, the number of such sequences may be substantially high because of the absence of any lipocalin hit in similarity-based searches. this explains the need for methods specific for lipocalin identification to complement such general similarity-based methods of protein annotation. thus, we embarked upon exploring machine learning methods based on various protein features to facilitate lipocalin identification.

performance of standalone svm models
we began with the loo cross-validation of aac, dpc, ssc and pssm based classifiers, trained using the three kernels-linear, polynomial and rbf . thereafter, hybrid models using combination of two or more features were also developed. the hold-out procedure was performed for the best classifiers to further assess the discriminative quality of the models. hold-out method provides a further reinforcement about the discriminative power, though because of the random partitioning of the datasets, the results may vary considerably for the different sets  <cit> . table  <dig>  summarise the performance of the best svm classifiers for each module and with each kernel as observed in the cross-validation tests.

*validation: a = leave-one-out; d = hold-out

kernel: r = rbf; p = polynomial; l = linear

composition based svm classifiers
we obtained accuracies of  <dig>  and  <dig> % in aac-based svm models with the linear and polynomial kernels respectively, and  <dig> % with the rbf kernel . the accuracies sharply increased with dpc usage and reached  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % for the three kernels, respectively. however, the ssc model yielded the accuracies of  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively with the linear and polynomial kernel whereas with rbf, the accuracy touched a striking high of  <dig> % with an mcc of  <dig> . the sensitivity and specificity of this model were also appreciably high at  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively. the remarkably better performance of ssc vs aac and dpc models is congruent with the known structural conservation albeit the high sequential heterogeneity of lipocalins.

pssm profile based svm classifier
psi-blast derived pssm profiles captures useful information about the residue composition as well as conservation of residues at crucial positions within the protein sequence, because in evolution the amino acid residues with similar physico-chemical properties tend to be highly conserved due to selective pressure. pssm profiles have been used as svm input feature for a number of classification problems, e.g. prediction of sub-cellular localization  <cit> , nucleic acid binding proteins  <cit> , etc.

we used the pssm profile, normalized using the logistic function  for developing an svm module. the pssm profile-based model yielded maximal accuracies of  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively with linear and polynomial kernels respectively, and a remarkably high accuracy of  <dig> % with the rbf kernel, with the sensitivity and specificity of  <dig>  and  <dig> % along with an mcc of  <dig> .

performance of hybrid svm models
with an aim to further enhance the prediction accuracy, we developed and evaluated four hybrid models using different combinations of features .

dpc and ssc hybrid
this model performed better than the standalone dpc model but did not achieve any improvement over the ssc model, showing the maximum accuracy of  <dig> % with the polynomial kernel. with the linear and rbf kernels, the accuracies were  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively.

dpc and pssm hybrid
this hybrid model performed as well as dpc but much worse than the pssm model and showed a dramatic dip to an overall maximal accuracy of  <dig> % with the polynomial kernel. this may be attributable to noise produced by the increase in the length of training input to  <dig> dimensions. with the linear and rbf kernels also, the performance was comparable at  <dig>  and  <dig> % accuracies.

pssm and ssc hybrid
this was the model with the highest overall accuracy of  <dig> %, better than both the pssm and ssc models, but with a slightly lower sensitivity  and higher specificity  as that of the pssm model. the accuracy was  <dig>  and  <dig> % with both the linear and polynomial kernels. this model achieved the best overall accuracy amongst all the models.

dpc, pssm and ssc hybrid
this model performed reasonably well, with accuracies of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % with the polynomial, rbf and linear kernels respectively. yet this was not an improvement over any of the models based on one or two features and was therefore not considered for any further evaluation.

hold-out procedure
hold-out procedure was run on the three best svm models: pssm, ssc and pssm-ssc. this procedure simulates the performance of the classifier over a blind test set since only randomly chosen one-half of the data is used for training while the other half is used for testing. two runs of hold-out method were therefore carried out at the same parameters as obtained from loo since this would be used for final prediction. the three classifiers achieved around 85%  accuracy in both the runs, reflecting the strong discriminative power of the models.

roc plot
roc curves show the trade-off between true positive rate  and false positive rate  over their entire range of possible values. it is considered as the most robust approach for classifier evaluation  <cit> . the area under the roc curve  is used as a reliable index of classifier performance. to validate the threshold-independent performance of our svm models, we compared the roc curves for the best svm models obtained for each feature as well as combination of up to three features .

a comparison of aucs for various roc curves revealed that the models followed almost the same increasing order of auc as the prediction accuracies in svm: aac , pssm-dpc , dpc , ssc , pssm , dpc-ssc , pssm-dpc-ssc , pssm-ssc . only in one case, namely for the pssm model, the auc did not follow the order of prediction accuracy in svm. there was a complete overlap for the curves for dpc-ssc and pssm-dpc-ssc as also reflected in their exactly similar accuracies .

this analysis verified the efficacy of the svm classifiers. these auc values are significantly higher than that of random guessing .

testing
performance on independent datasets
loo and hold-out tests may give over-optimistic estimates of performances because the model parameters are optimal for the datasets used for training but may not perform well on unseen data  <cit> . to confirm the behaviour of the models, we tested the performance of the classifiers on independent datasets. table  <dig> depicts the performance of the classifiers on three independent datasets- two negative and one positive dataset.

the table estimates the quality of the models generated from each module as compared to random prediction.

negative datasets: these consisted of other members of the calcyin superfamily, one set having  <dig> fabps and the other with  <dig> triabins, which are highly likely to be picked up as positives due to sharing evolutionary ties with lipocalins. due to structural and functional grounds, lipocalins and fabps have been merged into one pfam signature . however, fabps have a ten-stranded discontinuous beta-barrel structure as against the continuous eight strand barrel of lipocalins. triabins also differ from lipocalins in having an inverted stand topology for two beta strands in the beta barrel  <cit> . since we aimed to develop a classifier exclusively for lipocalins, we tested the performance of our final models on this set to gauge the selectivity of the models for lipocalins. whereas the pssm model could predict all of the  <dig> fabps as negatives, only  <dig> out of  <dig> triabins were predicted as negatives. the pssm-ssc and ssc models picked up  <dig> and  <dig> fabps respectively while both predicted all of the  <dig> triabins as non-lipocalins.

positive dataset: in order to evaluate the practical prediction ability of the final prediction models, an independent dataset consisting of  <dig> lipocalin sequences was used. while the pssm model could predict  <dig> sequences, the pssm-ssc model predicted  <dig> sequences as lipocalins. the ssc model picked up only  <dig> as lipocalins.

comparison of classifier's performance with random prediction
the three best models were used for testing on independent datasets. the numbers show the correctly predicted sequences out of the total given in the first row.

implementation
the prediction algorithm presented in this study is implemented as a freely accessible web server at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/lipocalinpred . the web server is hosted on a t <dig> sun server. php is used to generate the front-end html pages.

the program predicts lipocalins based on the two best classifiers, namely the ones based on pssm profile alone and pssm-ssc. it accepts the sequences in fasta format and allows the user to select different thresholds of prediction ranging from - <dig>  to  <dig> . the default thresholds on the server are the ones which yielded the best accuracies in cross-validations. the output consists of the sequence id, the svm score and the decision of the model regarding the sequence based on the threshold chosen. the higher the svm score, the better is the confidence level of prediction. the web-server also allows the user to scan a set of sequences for lipocalin-related pfam signatures. an indexed database of lipocalins is also included to allow the user to search lipocalin sequences sharing regions of similarity to the query sequence set using viroblast  <cit> .

perspectives
the performance of aac and dpc-based models is consistent with the fact that the lipocalins show remarkable diversity at the primary structure level. hence, it is not surprising that the svm models trained on aac and dpc miss out a significant chunk of the training sequences.

for the ssc and its hybrid models, the inability to correctly predict some sequences can be reconciled in light of factors like limitation of the psipred algorithm itself, which is used for secondary structure prediction in the study.

even the models based on pssm and its hybrid models fail to predict few lipocalins due to extreme divergence amongst the proteins. the dynamism of evolutionary forces which finally shape the structural and functional aspects of families of diverse proteins like lipocalins results in extreme sequence divergence amongst its members.

the prediction statistics obtained from models based on implementation of features used to develop the best model are highly encouraging. in future, inclusion of additional lipocalin sequences, features and more efficient methods for secondary structure prediction will further improve the efficiency of lipocalinpred.

CONCLUSIONS
current lipocalin identification methods include experimental determination and homology modelling, which require enormous efforts. the study presented here represents an initiative towards easy identification of lipocalins from other proteins with high selectivity. apart from solving the lipocalin identification problem in particular, it advocates and reinforces the rational application of machine-learning algorithms like svms to classification problems in biology. the study could be extended to other families sharing low pairwise sequence similarity, e.g. to develop an svm classifier exclusively for fabps. since lipocalins are widely spread across the different biological kingdoms, the algorithm may be used for the proteome-wide prediction of lipocalins, especially in cases where their existence is dubious as for archaebacteria. though identification of a protein sequence as a lipocalin would speak little about function because of the high functional versatility, yet it would provide significant clues about the protein structure and hence lead the way towards providing mechanistic insights about the protein.
