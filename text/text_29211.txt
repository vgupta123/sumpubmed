BACKGROUND
transcription is a highly regulated multi-step process roughly divided into initiation, elongation and termination. prokaryotic transcription termination can occur via factor-dependent or factor-independent termination and is known to play key roles in regulating genetic systems. factor-independent termination occurs at defined sequence regions known as intrinsic terminators and factor-dependent termination relies on the destabilisation of transcription complexes by a rho regulatory protein  <cit> . sequence features within intrinsic terminators have been studied in different organisms resulting in models for how these motifs contribute to overall termination efficiency, and have been used to develop computational methods to identify terminator elements within genome sequences  <cit> .

mycoplasmas are cell wall-less prokaryotes of the class mollicutes, phylogenetically related to gram-positive bacteria and characterised by having small genomes with a low gc content. mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is considered the etiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, a disease with global distribution and causing significant economic losses in the pig farming industry  <cit> .

in recent years, the genomes of many mycoplasma species have been completely sequenced, including those of some m. hyopneumoniae strains  <cit> . the sequencing of several mycoplasma genomes has provided an extensive comparative analysis of gene content among different species and information related to gene organisation in large transcriptional units   <cit> . moreover, promoter sequences have been defined and mapped for the m. hyopneumoniae genome  <cit>  and recently, transcriptome analysis has validated the organization of m. hyopneumoniae genome in long transcriptional units  <cit> .

however, despite the genome-scale sequencing efforts, prediction and recognition of mycoplasma terminator elements is poorly known. the unusually low gc content of intergenic regions  in the mycoplasma genome  <cit>  may be the main reason for the lack of success in application of existing computational methods developed to predict putative intrinsic terminators. moreover, gene coding for rho regulatory protein was not found in mycoplasma genomes suggesting the absence of factor-dependent transcription termination in these organisms  <cit> .

studies investigating the presence of intrinsic terminators in mycoplasma were initially contradictory. analysis of average rna folding energy near stop codons demonstrated that no stem-loops were formed in mycoplasma genitalium or mycoplasma pneumoniae coding sequences , indicating the existence of qualitatively different and uncharacterised mechanisms for transcription termination  <cit> . however, the development of algorithms to predict terminators in low gc content genomes allowed the identification of stem-loop structures in some positions of mycoplasma genomes  <cit> . furthermore, several studies showed that intrinsic terminators have a functional role in mycoplasmas  <cit>  suggesting that the intrinsic terminators could be the main mode of termination.

previously, we have described the genome organisation profile and mapped promoter sequences upstream of all transcription units of the m. hyopneumoniae genome  <cit> . these results provided insights into the gene organisation and transcription initiation at the genome scale. to further understand the mechanism of transcription in m. hyopneumoniae genome, in the current study we have analysed and predicted the presence of terminator sequences downstream of the transcription units. we have also determined the role of these predicted sequences, revealing that intrinsic terminators are the main mechanism of transcription termination in m. hyopneumoniae.

methods
in silico analysis of terminators
the prediction of terminator sequences was performed in m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  using three software algorithms: transtermhp  <cit> , webgester  <cit>  and arnold  <cit> . the software webgester restricts the search for palindrome sequences in a region ranging from − <dig> to +270 bp from the cds stop codon and allows the search of non-canonical terminators . transtermhp algorithm restricts the search of palindrome sequences to regions in which occurs the presence of at least three thymines in sequence and, therefore, unable to find non-canonical terminators. arnold combines two algorithms, erpin and rnamotif, which are based on terminators of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and do not consider the gene context in which the terminators occur. figure  <dig> shows the workflow of our terminator prediction classification. class  <dig> terminators  were defined using genome localisation parameters as follows: terminator sequences located at the 3’ end of the last gene of the polycistronic unit ; terminator sequences located at the 3’ end of the monocistronic unit ; terminator sequences located at the 3’ end of genes within the pcs. for subsequent analyses steps we have selected all terminator sequences located at the 3’ end of pcs or mcs and established new criteria for terminator classification: i) class  <dig> terminator  sequences were considered when positioned at the end of pc or mc and predicted by at least two different algorithms; ii) class  <dig> terminators  classification considered all tc <dig> with two additional features: first the distance between the terminator first nucleotide and the stop codon of the target gene should range from − <dig> to  <dig> base pairs and second, the values of gibbs free energy  should be less than −4 kcal/mol; and iii) class  <dig> terminators  were all tc <dig> that contained only one of the features of class  <dig> terminators. the terminators in the m. hyopneumoniae genome were mapped using artemis software  <cit> .figure  <dig>

primer design
specific rt-pcr and qpcr primers were designed  to target transcription before and after the selected predicted position of the terminators. figure  <dig> illustrates an example  of the position of primer pairs to validate the putative terminator. figure 2a shows a global view of the putative terminator w_ <dig> and figure 2b demonstrates a detailed position of the primers with the product length expected. as shown in figure 2b we designed two pairs of primers for each terminator analysis for both rt-pcr and qpcr methodologies. briefly, the forward primers were positioned inside the coding region of the selected cds . one reverse primer was positioned between the stop codon of the cds and the start of the putative terminator . the second reverse primer was positioned immediately after the putative terminator . a total of  <dig> primer pairs were prepared for confirmation of  <dig> putative terminators . primers were designed in vector nti advance  <dig> .figure  <dig>

culture conditions and rna isolation
m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> isolated from an infected swine   <cit>  was grown in 25 ml of friis broth  <cit>  at 37°c for 24 h with gentle agitation in a roller drum. total rna was isolated with rneasy mini kit . for cell lyses,  <dig>  ml of rneasy lysis buffer  in the presence of  <dig>  m of β-mercaptoethanol was used per cultivation flask. the purification was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with on-column dnasei digestion using the rnase-free dnase set  and a second round of treatment with dnase i . dna absence was monitored to below pcr-detectable levels. extracted rna was analysed by gel electrophoresis and quantified in the qubit system . finally, rna quality and integrity were determined by the evaluation of the rna integrity number  using the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . values equal to or greater than  <dig>  indicated sufficient quality.

reverse transcriptase pcr  assay
for first-strand cdna synthesis we used 1 μg of total rna,  <dig> pmol of specific reverse primer  and 10 mm of deoxynucleotide triphosphates. the mixture was heated to 70°c for 5 min and then incubated on ice for 5 min. first-strand buffer ,  <dig>  m dithiothreitol,  <dig> u rnase inhibitor  and  <dig> u m-mlv rt  were then added to a total volume of 20 μl. the reaction was incubated at 37°c for 60 min followed by 15 min at 70°c for enzyme inactivation. a negative control was prepared in parallel, differing only by the absence of the rt enzyme.

pcrs included  <dig> u gotaq dna polymerase , 5x of gotaq buffer, 1 mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate,  <dig> pmol of each primer  and 1 μl of the first-strand cdna reaction in a final volume of 25 μl. a negative control of rt-pcr was prepared in parallel, which differed only by the absence of cdna, and no genomic dna was added to the reaction mixture for the pcr negative control. a pcr positive control was prepared using the genomic dna of m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> as the template. the pcr conditions were: 1 cycle at 94°c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°c for 30 s; denaturation and extension temperature and time varied according to each primer pair . the final extension step was at 72°c for 10 min. reaction products were analysed in  <dig> % agarose gels.

qpcr experimental design
quantitative rt-pcr was performed using 1: <dig> cdna prepared as described for rt-pcr as template and platinum sybr green qpcr supermix-udg  on the stepone real-time pcr system . the qpcr reactions were carried out at 90°c for 2 min and 95°c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 15 s and 55°c for 1 min each. the specificity of the synthesised products and the absence of primer dimers were visualised using a melting curve analysis for each reaction. amplification efficiency for each primer pair was calculated using the linregpcr software application  <cit>  and the mean efficiency values for each primer were added to additional file  <dig>  this efficiency value was used for the quantification analysis.

relative expression of mrna was calculated by the 2-Δct method  <cit> . to control for all the experiments the threshold cycle  values were normalised to the reference gene mhp7448_ <dig>  <cit> . the ct of each test target represents the average of three reactions. three independent biological replicates were done for each target gene. we performed statistical analysis using graphpad prism  <dig> software. a two-tailed unpaired t-test was used to test for differences in the relative expression values between the regions before and after the terminator structure .

RESULTS
prediction of terminator sequences
computational analysis of m. hyopneumoniae genome using three different algorithms predicted  <dig> terminators:  <dig> terminators using arnold software,  <dig> using transtermhp software and  <dig> using webgester software . these terminators were named using the initial letter of the software  followed by a number. for example terminator t_ <dig> is the first terminator predicted by transtermhp software. terminators named “wf” represent terminators classified as unstable terminators in the webgester software .table  <dig>

the classification criteria defined in figure  <dig> were applied to validate the predicted terminators. class  <dig> terminators, named tc <dig>  should be positioned at the 3’ end of the cds. using this criterion,  <dig> terminators of the  <dig> predicted terminators were selected  . the remaining predicted terminators were localised within coding regions or on the antisense strand and therefore, were not further analysed in this work.

the  <dig> tc <dig> terminators were analysed according to the genomic context of m. hyopneumoniae. the m. hyopneumoniae genome is organised in  <dig> monocistronic units  and  <dig> polycistronic units  containing two or more orfs  <cit> . therefore, systematic terminator localisation was performed in the downstream regions of all annotated orfs in the genome. this analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> tc <dig> terminators at the end of mcs,  <dig> tc <dig> terminators at the end of pcs and  <dig> tc <dig> terminators at the 3’ end of some orfs that were located internal in some polycistronic units  . moreover, more than one predicted terminator sequence can be found in some transcriptional units. class  <dig> terminators were identified in all  <dig> mcs and in  <dig> of the  <dig> pcs  suggesting that transcription termination occurs preferentially at the ends of mcs and pcs.

the class  <dig> terminators  were further divided into class  <dig>  class  <dig> and class  <dig> terminators. to ensure the reliability of the generated data, the mc and pc tc <dig> terminators located at the same position by at least two algorithms were considered putative terminators and named class  <dig> terminators . using this approach we were able to identify class tc <dig> terminators in seven of the  <dig> mcs  and in  <dig> of the  <dig> pcs  . detailed analysis of the characteristics of these terminators revealed the presence of two distinguishing features: i) the distance between the start of the terminator and the stop codon of the target gene showed a range of −11 bp to 200 bp and ii) the values of gibbs free energy  were less than −4 kcal/mol . the presence of two class tc <dig> terminators at a distance greater than 230 bp from the stop codon  was identified at 3’ end of tu_ <dig>  and tu_ <dig> . however, further analysis revealed the presence of other tc <dig> terminators at the 3’ end of these two pcs at position  <dig> or  <dig> for tu_ <dig> and at positions  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> for tu_ <dig> .table  <dig>

to increase the number of mcs and pcs containing putative terminators  all the remaining tc <dig> terminators were screened using the features defined in class  <dig> terminators . terminators that satisfied both criteria  were reclassified as class  <dig> terminators  and those that displayed only one of the two criteria were named class  <dig> terminators . it is important to point out that, in contrast to class  <dig> terminators, the class  <dig> terminators were defined by only one algorithm. class  <dig> terminators were identified in  <dig> of  <dig> mcs  and in  <dig> of  <dig> pcs  increasing the number of mcs and pcs with putative terminators to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . class  <dig> terminators  were found in six mcs  and eleven pcs  of the m. hyopneumoniae genome.

experimental validation of m. hyopneumoniae terminators
rt-pcr and qpcr were used to test whether the predicted terminators were related to transcription termination in m. hyopneumoniae. the terminator validation hypothesis was based on the following premises: i) mc or pc transcripts ended at the predicted terminator sequences; and ii) no mc or pc transcripts were present after the predicted terminator sequences. primer pairs  were positioned to validate this hypothesis, similar to the terminator validation previously used by arrebola et al.  <cit> .

rt-pcr was performed for  <dig> putative terminator sequences. among the putative terminator sequences analysed, four belonged to class tc <dig>  one to class tc <dig> and  <dig> to class tc <dig> . the figure  <dig> shows the validation of a tc <dig> terminator  in tu_ <dig>  used as example, where two primer pairs were designed for rt-pcr analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  primer pairs were positioned to analyse the presence of transcripts upstream and immediately downstream of the predicted terminator. tu_ <dig> is composed of genes mhp7448_ <dig> and nox. at the end of the nox gene, three tc <dig> terminators were identified . the experimental analysis considered the w_ <dig> terminator located at 39 bp of the nox gene stop codon. this terminator is formed of a stem of  <dig> nucleotides with only one mismatch, one loop of three nucleotides, the u-tract and has a Δg of − <dig>  kcal/mol . as demonstrated in figure 4b  amplification was observed only when primers were positioned upstream of the terminator sequence indicating that the w_ <dig> terminator is responsible for transcription termination in m. hyopneumoniae tu_ <dig> table  <dig>

transcription termination was also demonstrated in the presence of tc <dig> terminators t_ <dig> and w_ <dig> located at tu_ <dig> and tu_ <dig>  respectively . in six tc <dig> terminators , amplification product was detected only when using primers located upstream of the putative terminator sequence, suggesting that the presence of tc <dig> terminators at the 3’ end of mc_ <dig>  mc_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig> and tu_ <dig> were responsible for transcription termination . these data shows that the putative intrinsic terminators are functional in mycoplasmas.

in the other class  <dig> terminator , class  <dig> terminator  and four class  <dig> terminators , amplification products were detected when primers located downstream of the terminator were used and, therefore, could not be validated by rt-pcr. however, it is possible that some terminators, although incapable of efficient transcription termination, could cause a decrease in the level of transcription. to confirm this hypothesis, rna expression level was quantified using qpcr.

real-time quantitative pcr was performed for selected class  <dig>  class  <dig> and class  <dig> terminators based on the feasibility of primer design, as the m. hyopneumoniae genome has an intergenic low gc content. a total of  <dig> terminators were analysed by qpcr : eight tc <dig> , seven tc <dig>  and one tc <dig> terminators . in order to compare rt-pcr and qpcr methodologies, terminator w_ <dig> of tu_ <dig>  a tc <dig> terminator previously confirmed by rt-pcr , was also analysed by qpcr .table  <dig>

for the majority of tested terminators primer efficiency was greater than 80%. only the primers used to analyse the terminator in tu_ <dig> showed, in both primer pairs, a lower efficiency of 65% . moreover, the primer pairs designed for terminator sequences w_ <dig> in tu_ <dig> and t_ <dig> in tu_ <dig> revealed differences in efficiency between upstream and downstream primers of around 50% . this result is probably related to the absence of detected transcripts in the qpcr .

the eight class  <dig> transcriptional terminators analysed by qpcr were localised at 3’ end of the last gene in tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig> and tu_ <dig> . real-time quantitative pcr demonstrated that only transcripts found for tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig> and tu_ <dig> had similar expression levels to the gene used for normalization  in these experiments. the transcriptional terminators were characterised by comparison between transcripts level using primers upstream of the putative terminator sequence  and downstream of the terminator sequence . terminators w_ <dig> in tu_ <dig>  t_ <dig> in tu_ <dig> and w_ <dig> in tu_ <dig> can be considered valid terminators as no transcripts were detected downstream of the terminator sequence . the other tc <dig> class terminators, t_ <dig> in tu_ <dig>  a_ <dig> in tu_ <dig>  t_ <dig> in tu_ <dig>  a_ <dig> in tu_ <dig>  and w_ <dig> in tu_ <dig> displayed a significant  decrease in transcription when downstream primers were used  and also could be related to transcriptional termination.

transcriptional terminators classified as class  <dig>  and class  <dig>  terminators were also analysed by qpcr . similar to some tc <dig> class terminators, all tc <dig> and tc <dig> class terminators displayed a significant  decrease in transcription when downstream primers were used, with exception of w_ <dig> in mc_ <dig> . interestingly, a second tc <dig>  putative terminator was localised at 74 bp downstream of the first terminator w_ <dig> . the presence of two putative terminators in this monocistronic unit suggests that they could have complementary functions.

aiming to summarize our results figure  <dig> shows the localisation of both promoter sequences and intrinsic terminators according the genome organisation of m. hyopneumoniae. previous works of our group have demonstrated that the genome is organized preferably in long transcriptional units containing promoter sequences upstream the start codon of the first gene of the units  <cit> . among the putative class  <dig> and class  <dig> terminators, represented in figure  <dig>  the functional terminators at the end of tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig> and mc_ <dig>  were also experimentally demonstrated by rt-pcr and qpcr analyses .figure  <dig>

discussion
the importance of the characterisation of rho-independent termination in mycoplasma can be related with the accurate prediction of transcription units in these bacteria. in general, the properties of intrinsic terminators, such as sequence and the structural features of the hairpin and, in some cases, the u-tract of the nascent transcript, could be involved in transcription termination. previous works have demonstrated the predominance and conservation of rho-independent or intrinsic termination among the mollicutes class  <cit> .

we identified transcription terminators for m. hyopneumoniae in silico using three algorithms that demonstrated differences in efficiency of prediction. this method allowed the prediction of  <dig> terminators in m. hyopneumoniae genome. moreover, detailed analysis revealed the prediction of at least one terminator sequence in  <dig> of the 705 m. hyopneumoniae orfs .

in comparison to e. coli, the intrinsic terminators found in the m. hyopneumoniae genome display relatively high values of gibbs free energy density of stem-loop formation correlated to the low content of guanine and cytosine in the mollicutes genome  <cit> . similar values were also found in intrinsic terminators of m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae and are probably responsible for previous difficulties identifying intrinsic terminators in m. pneumoniae based on analysis of average rna folding energy near stop codons  <cit> . the presence of a u-tract following the stem-loop structure was detected for the majority of the predicted m. hyopneumoniae terminators. however, approximately 20% of m. hyopneumoniae stem-loop formation revealed absence of the u-tract tail of the nascent transcript. these results are similar to those found in other mycoplasma species, suggesting that the u-tract tail is not an essential requisite for intrinsic terminators in this genus  <cit> . nevertheless, the efficiency of transcription termination is maintained in intrinsic terminators without the u-tract  <cit> .

detailed localisation analysis of the  <dig> predicted terminators allowed us to select only those found at the 3’ end of pcs or mcs. using this approach we were able to distinguish inter- from intracistronic terminator-like structures and select  <dig> putative rho-independent terminators at the end of mcs and pcs. the prediction efficiency was different among the software, reflecting the specific algorithm used for each one. the best results were obtained with the software webgester, as is the only one of the three software packages that takes into consideration the gene context, considering a region ranging from − <dig> to +270 bp from the stop codon of cds, and allows the detection of terminators without a u-tract  <cit> . of the  <dig> terminators predicted by this program  <dig> were classified as class tc <dig>  the software transtermhp identified  <dig> terminators class tc <dig>  the lower number of predicted terminators found by the transtermhp software is related to the restrict search of palindromic sequences in regions with the presence of at least three thymines in sequence. therefore, the transtermhp program is able to found only canonical sequences  <cit> . the arnold software use the patterns defined for e. coli and b.subtilis and do not take in consideration the gene context in which the terminator occur  <cit> . this probably explains why only  <dig> of the  <dig>  predicted terminators, classified as class  <dig> terminators, were found by this program. the remaining terminators predicted by arnold program were localised within coding regions or on the antisense strand and therefore were not analysed in this paper.

class tc <dig> terminators were identified in all  <dig> mcs and in  <dig> of  <dig> pcs. this method was unable to localise terminators in only  <dig>  pcs. interestingly, in seven of them  the last orf is classified as hypothetical. moreover, terminator sequences were found upstream of the last orf in tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig>  tu_ <dig> and tu_ <dig> suggesting that transcription could be terminated before the last orf in these polycistronic units. in three pcs  the presence of a gene similar to one that codes for transposase was detected. therefore, we suggest that rho-independent termination occurs at specific sequences in m. hyopneumoniae genome.

aiming to distinguish m. hyopneumoniae rho-independent terminators from random stem-loop structure sequences we established rules to discover their distinguishing properties. we used class  <dig> terminator classification  to propose a model of intrinsic terminators and as a decision rule to define as putative terminators in m. hyopneumoniae genome. the decision rule had four parameters: i) an inverted repeat in the primary dna sequence positioned at the 3’ end of pc or mc followed or not by a short stretch of thymine residues; ii) predicted by at least two different algorithms; iii) distance between the terminator first nucleotide and the stop codon of the target gene range from − <dig> to 200 bp; and iv) the values of gibbs free energy  should be less than −4 kcal/mol. however, the application of these four rules validated terminators in silico in only 21% of the mcs  and in 34% of the pcs .

therefore, to increase the number of putative terminators of the  <dig> class  <dig> terminators we lowered the specificity of the class  <dig> decision rule as follows: class tc <dig> — class  <dig> intrinsic terminators validated by only one algorithm, maintaining rules i, iii and iv, described above; and class tc <dig> — class  <dig> intrinsic terminators validated by only one algorithm, maintaining rules i and iii or iv. using these new rules the numbers of transcriptional units containing putative terminators analysed in silico increased to  <dig> mcs and  <dig> pcs . therefore, putative intrinsic terminators have been found, by in silico analysis, in 76% of transcription units of the m. hyopneumoniae genome .

previous studies have demonstrated the presence of intrinsic terminators in genomes of m. genitalium  and m. pneumoniae   <cit> , and also in specific genes such as the 16s-23s rrna operon of m. hyopneumoniae  <cit> , the p <dig> operon of m. genitalium  <cit> , the mgpa and p <dig> operons, and the ldh gene of m. pneumoniae  <cit> . moreover, transcriptional terminators in bacterial genomes belonging to the firmicutes phylum have also been predicted revealing a high level of conservation  <cit> .

little information on transcription termination in m. hyopneumoniae is available. to validate the in silico putative terminators, experiments were performed for analysis of the transcription end guided by putative terminators. the experimental analyses evaluated  <dig> of the  <dig> putative intrinsic terminators belonging to class  <dig>  class  <dig> and class  <dig> terminators. the number of terminators experimentally analysed  was limited due to difficulties in designing primers for some locations as these intergenic regions are characterised by a high adenine and thymine content. in eleven putative terminator sequences, located at the 3’ end of two mcs and nine pcs, rt-pcr or qpcr demonstrated transcription termination. however, for some intrinsic terminators  transcription continued through the terminator sequence but the level of transcription decreased. the degree of transcriptional change that occurs during quantitative pcr suggests that rna polymerase continues past the terminator sequence and gradually release the rna, as demonstrated by transcriptome analysis  <cit> . as the termination efficiency of an intrinsic terminator is directly related to the stability of the stem-loop structure  <cit>  the relatively high Δg values in intrinsic terminators could be responsible for the read-through of some m. hyopneumoniae terminator sequences. supporting our findings, the presence of functional intrinsic terminators was previously demonstrated for genes in other mycoplasma species such as hmw of m. pneumoniae, vmpau of mycoplasma agalactiae and for the operon ftsz of m. genitalium  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in silico predictions, combined with experimental analysis, confirmed the presence of intrinsic terminators in m. hyopneumoniae genome. the figure  <dig> summarizes the current knowledge related to transcription in m. hyopneumoniae. the localisation of terminators sequences at the 3’ end of mcs and pcs supports previous findings that the m. hyopneumoniae genome is organised preferentially in tus containing two or more genes  <cit> . moreover, the experimental results suggest that at least some terminators have a functional role in mycoplasma. therefore, the presence of terminator sequences associated with the identification of promoter sequences in m. hyopneumoniae transcriptional units   <cit>  suggest that transcription runs on from an upstream promoter and terminates at specific stem-loop regions.
