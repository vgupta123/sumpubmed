BACKGROUND
dysentery caused by shigella dysenteriae type  <dig>  is a recurrent challenge in many parts of the world. epidemics of this disease are associated with a high rate of mortality in young children 
 <cit> . treatment is complicated by the rapid emergence of sd <dig> strains resistant to the newest antibiotics 
 <cit> . no vaccine protective against sd <dig> is currently available, but efforts to create one are underway 
 <cit> . sd <dig> was first identified in japan at the end of the 19th century, during a pandemic that killed thousands 
 <cit> . the most recent pandemics took place in central america between  <dig> and  <dig>  south asia in the mid 1970s, central africa and south east asia in the 1980s, and east africa in the 1990s 
 <cit> . intermittent outbreaks still hit these regions, such as guatemala in  <dig> 
 <cit>  and cameroon in  <dig> 
 <cit> . typically, deteriorated hygiene conditions and overcrowding contribute to the occurrence of outbreaks. the spread of sd <dig> infection is correlated with human activity and population density rather than water, which has been associated with outbreaks of other types of shigella <cit> ; however, the specific circumstances under which epidemics emerge are not understood. between outbreaks, few sporadic cases, if any, are documented. humans are the only known hosts, and no natural reservoir has ever been identified. sd <dig> is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, by direct contact with an infected person or by contamination of food or surfaces 
 <cit> .

genomic analyses have revealed that sd <dig> descends from an escherichia coli strain that gained the ability to colonize the mucosal epithelium cells of the large intestine 
. this phenotype is made possible by functions encoded on an invasion plasmid and on the chromosome, and it is enhanced by the loss of some functions inherited from the ancestral e. coli <cit> . in addition to being the deadliest shigella strain, sd <dig> distinguishes itself from other shigella by its atypical invasion plasmid, which is a combination of the two known variants, pinva and pinvb 
 <cit> , and by the production of the stx <dig> toxin that is also produced by multiple virulent e. coli. sd <dig> is the most infectious of all shigella strains, causing disease with an inoculum as low as 10 cfu 
 <cit> .

studying sd <dig> is made difficult by the fact that stool samples must be immediately and properly stored and refrigerated in order to recover viable sd <dig> isolates 
 <cit> . sd <dig> outbreaks often take place in already dire circumstances  in which its proper collection, immediate refrigeration and study is problematic. the investigation of sd <dig> pathogenesis is also challenging due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. to gain some insight into this elusive pathogen, we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of  <dig> strains collected in the regions that underwent the most recent pandemics. from whole-genome analysis it appears that the prominent sd <dig> lineages emerged in the recent past and remained ubiquitous over the 20th century. sd <dig> genomes evolve with a relative high rate of substitution and substantial horizontal transfer, and mostly without selection. we explored the implication of this evolution for the management and diagnosis of future outbreaks.

RESULTS
genomic diversity of sd <dig> strains involved in major pandemics
the genomes of  <dig> sd <dig> strains were sequenced using illumina ngs technology  and assembled de novo . strains originated from central america 
 <cit> , africa 
 and asia 
 . this set of strains, collected from patients over the course of outbreaks or as sporadic cases in endemic regions, encompasses every region in which the main pandemics took place 
 <cit> . in addition, a strain collected in tennessee from a child with no history of travel was sequenced. the publicly available genome of sd <dig>  a strain isolated in china in  <dig> 
 <cit> , was included in our analyses.

multi-copy is elements make up approximately 25% of sd <dig> genomes and cause frequent contig breaks during the assembly process . to assess genetic diversity among the  <dig> strains, we first created consistently annotated genomes and organized gene content by orthologous families using pgat 
 <cit> . a total of  <dig>  gene families were identified from the chromosome:  <dig>  are present and functional in every strain ;  <dig> are present or functional in only a subset of strains , including  <dig> that were lost  and  <dig> gained  . gene content is highly homogenous and gene order is highly conserved among strains, as seen in contigs large enough to reveal synteny . insertion sites of is elements are also conserved suggesting that most insertions took place in the ancestor of all these sd <dig> strains . because the invasion plasmid , required for sd <dig> to cause disease 
 <cit> , could not be fully assembled using our method , we were not able to assess gene content or order; however, we investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms  and found very limited variation in these strains .

sd <dig> strains genetic relatedness and intercontinental distribution
to investigate the relatedness between the  <dig> sd <dig> strains, we built a phylogenetic tree that included a subset of e. coli genomes and genomes of other shigella species . using pgat 
 <cit> , we identified a set of  <dig>  genes for which an ortholog was present as a single copy in every genome included in the phylogenetic analysis . nucleotide alignments were generated for each gene family from which a total  <dig>  snps were extracted. the maximum likelihood tree in figure 
1a shows that all sd <dig> strains  are closely related and form a clade separate from e. coli and other shigella species. the overall tree topology is the same as previously published 
 <cit> . the branch leading to the sd <dig> strains is longer than the others, suggesting that this lineage was subjected to a higher rate of substitution or a higher rate of gene recombination than its e. coli and shigella relatives. although recombination events do not influence the topology of the species phylogenetic tree 
 <cit> , recombination is known to take place in e. coli genomes, and to contribute to sequence divergence. hence, to assess the role of recombination in the evolution of sd <dig> ancestral genome, we estimated the number of snps in the alignment that were due to recombination for each genome . for the  <dig>  genes used to build the phylogeny, all shigella genomes exhibit a higher rate of recombination compared to e. coli genomes . however, the extent of recombination overall might be underestimated for the e. coli genomes because the genes identified as hot spots for recombination in e. coli are part of the accessory genome, hence not included in the set of  <dig>  genes 
 <cit> . the number of snps predicted to be the result of recombination in shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri genomes is higher than the number of snps in the genome of shigella dysenteriae . this suggests that the greater length of the branch observed for sd <dig> in the phylogenetic tree  compared to the other branches in the tree is not only due to recombination events, but also to a higher substitution rate compared to the other shigella subspecies and e. coli.figure  <dig>

phylogenetic relationships between sd <dig> strains were reconstructed in more detail based on the  <dig> snps found within the sd <dig> core genome . only  <dig> genes out of the  <dig>  sd <dig> core genes were polymorphic across these strains due to mutations, and no trace of recombination could be found in the individual sd <dig> strains, suggesting that no recombination event took place after their divergence from the common ancestor. the maximum likelihood tree  shows that four lineages arose almost simultaneously from one unique ancestor. lineage a is solely represented by bs <dig>  a strain that was not associated with an outbreak  and lineage b by sd <dig> . lineages d and c co-exist in different parts of the world. for example, strains in lineage d are from india, bangladesh, thailand and central african republic, suggesting that strains moved around the world rapidly and recently.

recent emergence of the clone responsible for the latest pandemics and multiple intercontinental transfers
the paucity of snps and the lack of observed recombination events among sd <dig> genomes suggest that the common ancestor to all these strains is very recent. overall the genetic distance between the root and the sd <dig> strains is consistent with the dates on which each strain was collected , providing a temporal signature of evolution. using a bayesian approach 
 <cit> , we estimated the age of the most recent common sd <dig> ancestor based on the concatenation of the  <dig> polymorphisms . we selected the model that yielded the best aicm value 
 <cit> : the gaussian markov random field skyride model, assuming a lognormal relaxed clock and the gtr substitution model 
 <cit>  . this model allows for variation of the substitution rate across the different branches of the tree. the resulting mean substitution rate is  <dig> e- <dig> substitutions per site per year, over the  <dig> polymorphic positions. the  <dig> polymorphic positions were detected across  <dig>  core genes representing  <dig> ,268 bp . based on these sequences, the rate of substitution genome-wide is about  <dig> e- <dig> . this is slightly higher than shigella sonnei for which a rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions per site per year has been calculated 
 <cit> . according to this model, lineages c and d seem to have emerged around the 1940s and 1950s respectively  and subsequently spread worldwide. the most recent common ancestor of lineages d <dig>  and d <dig>  dates from  <dig> , implying a recent intercontinental transfer. similarly, the most recent common ancestor of strain c <dig> from zambia and the strains collected in guatemala likely dates from the beginning of the 1960s , a mere eight years before the major outbreak that plagued guatemala affecting over  <dig>  people and killing more than  <dig>  of them 
 <cit> . this suggests another recent transfer from africa to central america, followed almost immediately by a vast clonal expansion. a rapid clonal expansion is also observed in all the subclades of lineage d, where the most recent common ancestors seem to pre-date the strains collected for the subclade by less than 10 years. the ancestor of all sd <dig> strains in our collection spread across the world around the beginning of the 20th century . consistent with this timeframe, previous research on shigella invasion plasmids concluded that sd <dig> appeared more recently than the other shigella dysenteriae serotypes and shigella species 
 <cit> . it is conceivable that this sd <dig> clone spread worldwide as an aftermath of world war i , a period of unusually high intercontinental transfer of people, troops and displaced populations, and conditions very favorable for outbreaks: high population density and poor hygiene conditions.

while no sd <dig> cases were reported between the 1970s and 1990s in guatemala, the clone that caused the  <dig> outbreak is the direct descendant of the major 1970s outbreak . the lack of genetic diversity among the  <dig> strains, which were collected at two different sites in guatemala, indicates that only one clone was responsible for the entire  <dig> outbreak . this clone has accumulated additional mutations compared to its close relatives collected in the 1970s, as illustrated by the relatively long branch in the tree . hence, it seems that sd <dig> replicated at a high rate over 20 years despite no cases being reported. in lineage d <dig>  the strain  dating from  <dig> is substantially closer to the root than the other strains  and was collected during an outbreak, while the more recent strains were reported as sporadic cases. this data suggest that after an outbreak, the strain is maintained in the population and is only sporadically detected.

genetic drift responsible for most gene loss and mutations
several scenarios could explain the observed predominance of two lineages in the most recent pandemics. lineages with mutations or gene losses promoting fitness in the host  may expand and replace previously existing clones. for example, a clone of salmonella enterica typhi carrying a mutation that confers resistance to fluoroquinolones has recently expanded within southern asia and may replace the existing clones there 
. if mutations are selected for the advantage they confer or against their detrimental effect, the distribution of genes that are mutated or lost across functional categories is likely to be non-random. alternatively, genes gained may favor clonal expansion and dissemination, as it has been observed with multiple drug resistance clones of shigella sonnei and chloramphenicol-resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium clones 
 <cit> . in sd <dig> genomes, the distribution of non-synonymous substitutions, found in  <dig> genes , and most gene loss  across functional categories is comparable to the distribution of all genes in the pan-genome across categories, r2 =  <dig>  and r2 =  <dig>  respectively . this indicates that no group of function in particular is targeted by selection, and therefore sd <dig> genomes seem to evolve mostly by genetic drift. the lack of selection on sd <dig> genomes is further supported by the overall dn/ds ratio between each pair of genomes : all pairwise comparisons yield a ratio close to  <dig> , indicating a random accumulation of mutations after the expansion of the original sd <dig> clone.figure  <dig> 
similarity of genes distributions across cog functional categories. a. distribution of genes in cog functional categories for the entire pan-genome, the genes that were lost in some strains and the genes modified by non-synonymous substitutions . genes for whom no function could be assigned were left out . b. genes lost and genes modified with non-synonymous substitutions tend to distribute across functional categories in a similar fashion as genes overall  indicating that the loss or modification of genes are selected at random. only one functional category contains more lost genes than expected: lipid metabolism. in contrast, the functions of genes that were gained do not reflect the distribution of genes overall across functional categories  .



advantageous mutations are detected in a few subclades. for example, a mutation in parc  
 <cit>  which confers resistance to quinolones is found in subclade d <dig> . interestingly, although sd <dig> cases were treated with fluoroquinolones in bangladesh over that period of time 
 <cit> , this resistant clone has not replaced the susceptible ones . furthermore, genes involved in lipid metabolism are lost at a higher rate than expected . the inability to synthesize some lipids could alter the cell surface, perhaps hindering cell surface recognition by the host immune system 
 <cit> . unfortunately, the impact on the cell surface of these losses cannot be determined solely based on the genes’ annotation.

the distribution of genes lost across the  <dig> strains  emphasizes the fact that genetic drift affects functions from all metabolic categories. as a consequence, phenotypes such as ability to metabolize some sugars or synthesize certain amino-acids may vary across strains. since isolation and identification of bacterial strains often relies on this type of phenotypes, it is possible that in the future some diagnostic methods, used to detect sd <dig> 
 <cit>  may be compromised if they do not rely on additional components.figure  <dig>

adaptation through gene gain: repeated acquisition of antibiotic resistance
the  <dig> genes gained by one or more strains are carried on phages or plasmids . in total,  <dig> genes with an analogous function were independently gained by strains that are evolutionarily distant from each other. figure 
4a illustrates the pattern of acquisition of these genes  across different lineages , and a description of all accessory genes and their distribution across strains can be found in additional file 
 <dig>  and their nucleotide sequences in additional file 
 <dig>  approximately 33% have functions associated with mobile elements, such as tra genes, phage integrases, plasmid replication and partition , while the others may bring new functions, such as antibiotic resistance. the observed independent and repeated gains suggest that these genes may confer a survival or fitness advantage. for example, a chloramphenicol resistance gene has been acquired at least five times in lineages c and d, and tetracycline resistance genes at least four. a gene cluster that confers resistance to tetracycline, and the transposon tn <dig> carrying resistance genes to chloramphenicol, mercury and β-lactams  have been gained conjointly at least twice in lineage c, on two different plasmids. the plasmid in lineage c <dig> is very similar to r <dig> from shigella flexneri 2b , while the plasmid in lineage c <dig> has an incb backbone and resembles escherichia coli husec <dig> plasmid phusec41- <dig> 
 <cit> . in lineage d, the genomes in subclades d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> also carry the tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance genes. those genes were found on an element very similar to a portion of the shigella resistance locus pathogenicity island of the shigella flexneri 2a 
 <cit>  . it is inserted at the ser trna  locus. this element also contains cp4-associated prophage genes, a potential haemolysin, an anaerobic decarboxylate transporter and an aspartate racemase potentially involved in cell envelope/outer membrane biogenesis. subclade d <dig> genomes also contain the antibiotic resistance genes, as well as some of the cp <dig> proteins, but lack the haemolysin. these genes in subclade d <dig> are carried on a plasmid of undetermined origin. subclade d <dig>  which diverged before the other subclades in lineage d, only carries the tetracycline resistance genes, but the assemblies did not unambiguously determine their positions in these genomes. neither the strain from lineage a , nor the strain from lineage b , contains any of these resistance genes. we identified additional antibiotic resistance genes  whose distribution was also inconsistent with phylogeny. for example, three antibiotic resistance genes  are found in all but one strain of clade d. in these strains, these resistance genes are carried by a plasmid  previously identified in shigella flexneri strain  <dig>  an epidemic pathogen in china 
 <cit> . the same three genes are found in two strains from the  <dig> guatemala outbreak , on a different plasmid that is a composite of different plasmid pieces found in enterobacteriaceae. since the most recent common ancestor for subclade c <dig> is dated from 3 years prior to the outbreak, the acquisition of this mobile element occurred soon after the beginning of the outbreak, and was thereafter rapidly selected. hence, it appears that sd <dig> strains recurrently overcome antibiotic treatments through the acquisition by their genomes of mobile elements carrying resistance genes.figure  <dig>

discussion
the sd <dig> strains collected over the course of several outbreaks are genetically close to each other. they are distributed in four clades, of which two are prominent in regions where the latest pandemics broke out. these two clades appeared during the 1940s-1950s, while the most recent common ancestor for all the strains in our collection likely emerged in the 1920s. it is possible that the spread of these clones is the result of the two world wars of the 20th century. the two conflicts provided ideal conditions for outbreaks and allowed for worldwide dissemination of sd <dig> clones through massive population movements. our data indicates that further intercontinental transmission occurred between asia and africa  and potentially between africa and central america . this lack of consistency between phylogeny and geography demonstrates the ability of sd <dig> to be transferred from one continent to another and immediately cause outbreaks there. this could suggest that sd <dig> has a different mode of transmission than some other bacterial pathogens causing pandemics, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> , shigella sonnei <cit> , neisseria meningitidis <cit>  and yersinia pestis <cit> , whose respective phylogenies are more consistent with their geographical distribution of isolates. based on the branch lengths in the tree and the rate given by beast, sd <dig> genomes sustain a relatively high rate of substitution compared to the genomes of e. coli and other shigella species. the majority of substitutions observed in the two main clades do not appear to have been subjected to selection over the last 60 years. genetic drift, an accelerated rate of mutation and lack of consistency between phylogeny and geography has already been observed for the enteric human-specific pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhi 
 <cit> . this pattern has been attributed to this pathogen’s maintenance and transmission by asymptomatic chronic carriers 
 <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that similar to salmonella enterica serovar typhi, sd <dig> could remain carried for a relatively long time by individuals that may not display the severe symptoms associated with disease, such as adults with significant protective immunity and/or resistance to severe disease. this could explain why sporadic cases of sd <dig> are observed between outbreaks, such as in bangladesh, and why sd <dig> seemingly disappears from a region only to cause a new outbreak 20 years later, e.g., in guatemala 
 <cit>  or india 
 <cit> . such a mode of transmission and maintenance would also explain the multiple intercontinental transfers, quickly followed by an outbreak. fluoroquinolones are heavily used in south-east asia to treat sd <dig>  and therefore constitute a strong selective pressure in the evolution of sd <dig> in this region. but subclade d <dig> , which includes isolates from the 1980s and the 2000s, has not replaced the susceptible clones causing outbreaks in the region. this lack of clonal replacement is also consistent with the constraints associated with human asymptomatic carriers on the spread of sd <dig>  long-term carriers of shigella, including one sd <dig> nearly asymptomatic carrier, have already been reported 
 <cit> . in this study, sd <dig> could not be consistently detected in the feces of the carrier 
 <cit> .

acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes through horizontal transfer is frequent, as illustrated by the numerous independent gains of tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance genes in lineages d and c, through different mechanisms. this suggests that although the genome evolution is neutral over the long-term, strains that carry the genes enabling them to defeat the antibiotic treatments are favored during an outbreak. in the case of a pathogen with a human carrier state, short-term selection and long-term neutrality are not mutually exclusive. over the course of an outbreak, strains that acquire resistance genes may be rapidly selected, and appear overrepresented, but these are not necessarily the strains that will be maintained through the human carrier state 
 <cit> . this is especially plausible if the carrier did not exhibit the usual severe symptoms, in which case no selective pressure through antibiotic treatment would take place.

genetic drift affects functions from all metabolic categories. this may result in a rapid divergence of biochemical phenotypes used by diagnostic tools: varying cell surface composition may interfere with serotyping and variation in sugar fermentation and amino-acid synthesis abilities may invalidate detection methods for sd <dig> based on bacterial cell culture 
 <cit> . hence, such methods may not be totally efficient at detecting sd <dig> in individuals, whether they present symptoms or not. a combination of tools to monitor the presence of sd <dig> may therefore be preferable to ensure that sd <dig> is consistently detected and to prevent future outbreaks.

the ability of sd <dig> to gain and retain genes and the possible existence of a carrier state may make it difficult to eradicate. it is likely that a combination of factors is responsible for the onset of outbreaks, such as a sudden deterioration of living conditions, caused by a war or a disaster, a change in a human carrier causing excretion of the pathogen, e.g. micronutrient deficiency or the disruption of the intestinal microbiome 
 <cit> , or the interaction between the carrier of the sd <dig> strain and an immunologically naive population.

although no sd <dig> outbreak has been reported since the early 2000s, we cannot rule out sd <dig> re-emergence, particularly in the setting of war or famine. in conclusion, a comparative genomic analysis of a variety of strains from different locales over the last 60 years indicates a possible mechanism for epidemic emergence of this important human pathogen and suggests that comparative genomic approaches are particularly helpful to investigate pathogens whose lifecycle is elusive and for which no environmental reservoir is known.

CONCLUSIONS
this study illustrates the important role of phylogenomic and comparative genomics analyses based on whole-genome sequencing for studying human-specific pathogens. results of these analyses point to long-term human carriers as means of shigella dysenteriae type 1’s maintenance and dissemination, and provide justification for a detailed epidemiological investigation, particularly where sd <dig> has become endemic. our analysis of the pan-genome suggests that the ongoing neutral evolution of sd <dig> strains may result in rapid divergence of phenotypes used by diagnostic tools and provides data for the design of new tools, should the current ones become compromised. next-generation sequencing technologies facilitate the investigation of pathogens that cannot be extensively studied in a laboratory or in the field, and help elucidate their biological lifecycle and their underlying epidemiology.
