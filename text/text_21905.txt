BACKGROUND
many cells produce exosomes  <cit> , small  membrane vesicles that are released into the extracellular environment by fusing with the plasma membrane  <cit> . although previously considered to be cellular waste products, emerging evidence indicates that exosomes can mediate diverse biological functions including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, tumor cell invasion and metastasis, immune response, and antigen presentation by the transfer of proteins, mrnas and non-coding rnas to neighboring or distant cells  <cit> .

the existence of exosomes has been known for many years; however, it is only recently that these lipid-rich vesicles have been reported to contain an abundance of nucleic acids, in particular small non-coding rnas  <cit> . studies have now shown that the packaging of rnas into exosomes is selective because the rna profiles in exosomes do not fully reflect the rna profiles observed in the parental cells  <cit> . when released from their cells of origin, exosomes may enter blood or other bodily fluids. to date, the microvesicles have been detected in blood , bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, bile, ascites, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid  <cit> . these circulating vesicles can be taken up by recipient cells, allowing for cell-cell communication regardless of the distance between the cells. exosome-mediated rna transfer is believed to be an effective method for cell signaling and the exosomal rna will certainly impact biological processes in the recipient cells  <cit> .

exosomal rnas have been implicated in many exosome-mediated biological functions  <cit> . for example, rnas delivered by exosomes prepared from x-ray treated cells were implicated in disseminating a bystander effect to target cells  <cit> . micrornas  transferred by tumor-derived exosomes were reported to down-regulate the tak <dig> pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis  <cit>  and were pivotal in promoting tumor metastasis via a proinflammatory cytokine-driven expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells  <cit> . the let- <dig> mirna family was selectively packaged into exosomes from a metastatic gastric cancer cell line and may have a role in the delivery of oncogenic signals to promote metastasis  <cit> . exosomes derived from human  and mouse  mast cell lines transported rna to neighboring mast cells, impacting the function of the recipient mast cells  <cit> . the mirnas transferred by the immune synapse were found to alter gene expression in the recipient antigen presenting cells  <cit> . these findings support the existence of a novel exosome-mediated mechanism by which one cell can regulate the activity or differentiation of other cells.

while exosomes have been shown to play functional roles in recipient cells, the rna content of the exosomes may provide unique molecular signatures for disease diagnosis and prognosis  <cit> . it has been reported that exosomes from diseased individuals contained rnas that were not found in healthy subjects  <cit> . these exosomes may carry rna signatures that are characteristic of the parental cells, for example, tumor cells. so far, tumor-derived exosomes have been identified in the plasma of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, malignant glioma, prostate cancer, and ovarian carcinoma ascites  <cit> . the association of exosomal mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> with metastatic prostate cancer has been confirmed in a cohort of patients with recurrent or non-recurrent cancer following radical prostatectomy  <cit> . these results suggest that circulating exosomes may provide a powerful tool for the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of human diseases.

most of the current studies have used microarray or real time quantitative pcr  assays to examine exosomal rnas, with a focus on mirnas. because of the inherent limitations of these technologies, unknown mirnas or other rna species are often undetectable. importantly, no systemic analysis of exosomal rnas in peripheral blood has been reported until now. blood is an important medium that allows exosomes to circulate and deliver cell signaling molecules to any part of the body. in this study, we performed a sequencing-based rna profiling analysis using the blood from three blood donors. we evaluated three small rna library preparation protocols and systemically characterized the extracellular rna species. this study will provide a general guideline for blood-based exosomal rna sequencing analysis and contribute to an understanding of exosome-mediated biological functions and mechanisms.

RESULTS
exosome size and rna stability
we used the nanosight lm <dig> instrument to determine the size distribution and concentration of the exosomes. for the three samples tested, the exosome sizes ranged from 30– <dig> nm . the number of exosomes per  <dig> μl of plasma ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  ×  <dig> and the rna yields from each of the samples were similar, ranging from 10– <dig> ng . the rnas sizes ranged from 18– <dig> nucleotides  . we repeated the rna extraction at least twice for each sample. the rna size distributions and yields were consistent both between extractions and between samples. we also ran an agilent rna  <dig> pico chip and found no evidence of cellular rna contamination . in subsequent enzyme protection assays, we treated the isolated nucleic acids with dnase i and found that there was no significant degradation; however, when treated with rnase a, the isolated nucleic acids were completely degraded . to test whether or not the exosome membrane protected rna from rnase a degradation, we treated plasma samples with rnase a under various conditions and obtained high yield of rnas in the samples after the treatment .

comparison of three small rna library preparation protocols
to compare three commercially available library preparation kits, we constructed sequencing libraries using  <dig> ng of exosomal rna and  <dig> pcr cycles for all the preparations. we found that there were significant differences in the size distribution of the amplified libraries when comparing the three different preparation protocols. each of the protocols was expected to have sequencing library size of 140– <dig> bp. among these kits, the nebnext multiplex small rna library preparation kit  produced more target fragments that were separated from adaptor dimers . the illumina kit constantly generated a strong dna fragment of ~ <dig> bp, but the target fragments were hardly seen. the bioo scientific kit generated fragments of the expected size, but separation with adaptor dimers was poor. although all three kits generated enough dna at the targeted size for sequencing, the pre-sequencing qpcr results showed that the neb kit produced the highest yield of recovered rna-seq libraries with less variation.

data processing and genome mapping
we replicated each of the three samples and tested each replicate in at least two separate library preparation protocols. in all we produced a total of  <dig> sequencing libraries . from the  <dig> libraries, we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw single-end reads, an average of about  <dig>  million reads per library. among the raw reads, we found  <dig> , <dig>  sequences with insert lengths ≥16nt  and of these,  <dig> %  could be mapped to known rnas and to the human genome . in  <dig> of the  <dig> libraries, at least 50% of the raw reads were mappable sequences . on average, the neb libraries had the highest percentage of mappable reads  while the bioo scientific and illimina libraries had  <dig> % and  <dig> % mappable reads, respectively. the size distribution of the inserts also varied among these kits. the neb libraries had the highest proportion of 21– <dig> nt inserts, followed by illumina and bioo scientific kit . nevertheless, in all three libraries, mirna sequences were the most common, accounting for  <dig> % of the mappable reads .

exosomal mirna content
because the abundance of most mirnas is low in the exosomes, we defined detectable mirnas as those that had at least one sequence per million mappable mirna reads. accordingly, we detected a total of  <dig> known mirnas in the  <dig> libraries. in each individual library, the number of detectable known mirnas varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig> . to validate the sequencing data, we selected three mirnas with different read counts for qpcr quantification; namely, mir-92a-3p, which had a high read count, and mir-191-3p and mir-26b-5p, which had relatively low counts. hek <dig> cellular rna was used as a positive control. the results showed that the expression levels of mir-92a-3p and mir-191-3p were  <dig> and  <dig>  fold higher than the expression level of mir-26b-5p . these relative abundance ratios were close to the ratios from the sequencing data using the illumina kit . as anticipated, the expression level of β-actin was extremely high in cells, but hardly detectable in the exosomes. the five most abundant mirnas in the libraries were mir-99a-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-124-3p, mir-22-3p, and mir-99b-5p, which together accounted for  <dig> % of all detectable mirnas . the  <dig> most abundant mirnas made up  <dig> % of the detectable mirna sequences; therefore, the remaining  <dig> low abundant mirnas accounted for only  <dig> % .

variability of mirnas between technical replicates, samples, and preparation protocols
to examine the variations of the mirna contents that may be produced by potential technical and biological variability, we performed a correlation coefficient analysis using log <dig> transformed values after normalizing reads to per million counts. for the seven pairs of technical replicates, the overall reproducibility was excellent regardless of the kits used  . the highest correlations were observed between the neb replicates , followed by the bioo scientific  and illumina  replicates.

for sample-sample  variations, we compared pooled samples  prepared using the bioo scientific and neb kits. overall, we found that there was significant correlation between samples b and c  , followed by between samples a and b , and then between samples a and c . however, when comparing the variations among the different library preparation protocols, we found striking differences although the average correlation coefficient r value was close to  <dig> . the correlation r values were  <dig>  between neb and bioo scientific ,  <dig>  between bioo scientific and illumima, and  <dig>  between neb and illumima.

to better demonstrate the technical, biological, and methodological variations, we performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using the log2-transformed sequence counts of the  <dig> most abundant mirna transcripts. as expected, the heat map showed that there was a clear separation between groups composed of replicates, samples and library preparation kits . nearly all of the  <dig> mirnas showed similar expression patterns between technical replicates; however, some of them showed significant variations among different samples and most showed differences among different preparation kits. for example, the neb kit detected over  <dig> fold more mir-129-5p sequences than either the illumina or the bioo scientific kits. the illumina kit generated over  <dig> fold more mir-486-5p sequences in sample a than either the bioo scientific or the neb kits. the bioo scientific kit produced over  <dig> fold more mir-124-3p sequences than either the illumina or the neb kits. the methodological variations were also evident for the top  <dig> most abundant mirnas .

sharing of detectable mirnas
to examine if the mirnas were unique to or common to the different preparation protocols, we first removed the low abundant mirnas  and then compared the remaining mirnas among the three kits. sample a was used for the comparison because this was the only sample that was tested in all three kits. the illumina, bioo scientific and neb kits detected  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> known mirnas, respectively. of these,  <dig> were detected by all three kits . in addition to the mirnas that were shared, we also identified some mirnas that were unique to one particular library preparation protocol. for example, mir-2964-3p and mir-3065-5p were detected only by the bioo scientific kit. however, the abundance of the unique mirnas were generally low in the libraries .

additionally, we examined different samples for mirna that were shared. samples a, b and c each had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas with > <dig> reads per million, respectively and  <dig> of them were shared among the three samples. samples a, b and c also had  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique mirnas, respectively . however, similar to the findings for the methodological differences, most of the sample-specific mirnas were low in abundance.

other rna species
to annotate the exosomal rna species that were not identified as mirna transcripts, we first removed all the known mirna sequences from the libraries and then mapped the remaining sequences to the human genome that had rna annotations. figure 5a shows the percentage of other small non-coding rnas, trna, rrna, small nuclear , small nucleolar  and piwi-interacting rna  that were detected. the rrna was the most common among them, accounting for  <dig> % of all mappable counts, followed by pirna , trna , snrna , and snorna . clearly, the exosomes contained relatively low levels of rrna, which is in contrast to a typical eukaryotic cell where rrna makes up at least 80% of the total rna molecules. interestingly, we also detected low levels of “long” rna in the small rna libraries. we detected  <dig> % of long non-coding rna ,  <dig> % of coding sequences ,  <dig> % of 3′untranslated region  and  <dig> % of 5′utr sequences . compared to cellular rna components, the cdss in the exosomal rnas accounted for a much smaller fraction of all mappable sequences. in addition, we found  <dig> % of other rna sequences that mapped to species other than human. for instance, the bovine bta-mir- <dig> was the most common non-human mirna found in the  <dig> libraries. however, this result should be interpreted with caution because most, if not all, of “non-human” rnas may be an artifact  <cit> .

the most abundant of the gene fragments that contained the cds, 5′utr or 3′utr sequences that were found in the small rna libraries were involved in fundamental metabolic processes . for example, the most common cds sequences mapped to nynrin  and lars <dig> , both of which encode proteins that participate in trna or rrna metabolism. the most frequent 5′utr sequence mapped to pvrl <dig> , which encodes a protein that is involved in the cell to cell spreading of herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies viruses  <cit> . the second most common 5′utr sequence mapped to entpd <dig> , which encodes an endo-apyrase that is capable of cleaving nucleoside tri- and/or di-phosphates  <cit> . the most frequent 3′utr sequence mapped to paqr <dig> , which encodes progestin and adipoq receptor family member v, which functions as a membrane progesterone receptor  <cit> .

predicted novel mirnas
to identify novel mirnas in the  <dig> libraries, all the raw data were processed independently using mirdeep <dig>  <cit> . the mirdeep <dig> software detected  <dig> distinct novel mirnas in the  <dig> libraries and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> novel mirnas in the individual libraries generated by the illumina, bioo scientific and neb kits, respectively . among the putative mirnas, two were common to libraries prepared with the illumina and neb kits, six were common to the illumina and bioo scientific libraries, and  <dig> were common to the neb and bioo scientific libraries. of the  <dig> putative mirnas in the illumina libraries, four  were found in technical replicates. for the bioo scientific-derived library,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas  were found in at least two replications and  <dig>  were common to at least two samples. for the neb-derived libraries,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas  were present in technical replicates and  <dig>  were common to at least two samples. a representative readout of the predicted mirnas from an neb library is shown in figure 5b. multiple reads of both the mature and star mirna sequences  were found in this library. all of the predicted mirnas had the typical mirna features at genomic dna level.

potential regulatory roles of exosomal mirnas
we performed gene enrichment analysis using a set of genes that were predicted to be targets of the highly abundant mirnas in the exosomes. the mirda tool  predicted a total of  <dig> target genes for the top five exosomal mirnas. we found significant enrichment of these genes in gene ontology  terms, including protein phosphorylation, rna splicing, chromosomal abnormality, and angiogenesis. for example, we found a  <dig>  fold enrichment of phosphoproteins , a  <dig>  fold enrichment of splice variants , and a  <dig>  fold enrichment of genes involving chromosomal rearrangement  . interestingly, we also observed significant enrichment in vasculature development  and neurotrophin signaling pathway .

discussion
exosomes circulating in the blood carry regulatory rna molecules, thereby allowing for long distance cell-cell communication. because diseased cells, including tumor cells, actively release exosomes into the blood stream, the circulating exosomes may provide a stable source of rnas for disease diagnosis, prognosis and treatment management  <cit> . in this study, we developed a protocol for isolating exosomal small rna from a very low volume of plasma. we performed deep sequencing analysis of the exosomal rnas, and generated expression profiles of the important extracellular rnas. our findings will not only help characterize the rna content of exosomes but will also contribute to understanding exosome function and biology.

exosomal rna profiling analysis is not possible without high quality rna. compared to cellular rnas, exosomal rnas are more stable  <cit> , and are reportedly resistant to physical degradation such as prolonged storage and freeze/thaw cycles  <cit> . the circulating exosomal rnas have been found to be resistant to biochemical degradation by ribonuclease in serum as well as by rnase a under an in vitro condition. this stability makes reproducible and consistent evaluation of blood-based non-coding rna possible  <cit> . indeed, our study strongly supports the protective role of the microvesicles or other proteins in the stability of the circulating plasma rna. recently, argonaute  <dig> was reported to bind and protect mirnas from degradation in the circulation  <cit> . it appears that argonaute 2-protected mirnas contribute to a significant proportion of the rna circulating in the blood. therefore, rnas  in the blood stream are protected by multiple mechanisms and may be more stable than previously believed  <cit> .

the dominant size of the exosomal rna that was detected in this study was 18– <dig> nt. this size range is apparently smaller than that of the small rnas derived from culture medium  <cit> , where the sizes were centered at about  <dig> nt. different isolation methods may account for the size discrepancies. ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  g seems to be less capable of discriminating exosomes from other microvesicles, especially when the exosomes are large. the mixed sizes of the isolated microvesicles may have caused more heterogeneity of rna biotypes, which in turn impacted on the size and abundance of the rnas in the libraries. in addition, the exoquick-based assay that we used to precipitate the exosomes may co-precipitate non-exosomal microparticles or rna-binding proteins. therefore, technically, the exosomal rna may account for a fraction of all rnas isolated by this assay. to obtain reproducible and reliable expression data, further study of the isolation methods is highly recommended.

the highly enriched exosomal mirnas may have significant impacts on the target cells. for example, mir-99a-5p, the most abundant mirna in the plasma exosomes, functions in a tissue-dependent manner. in prostate tumor tissue, mir-99a-5p was found to be down-regulated and its overexpression in a prostate cancer cell line was reported to inhibit the growth of the recipient cells and decreased the expression of the prostate-specific antigen  <cit> . however, overexpression of the mir-99a was also reported to be responsible for increased proliferation, migration and fibronectin levels in a murine epithelial cell line nmumg, possibly via modulating the tgf-β pathway  <cit> . the functional role of mir- <dig> as a tumor suppressor has been established in glioblastoma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer  <cit> . another study demonstrated that mir- <dig> silencing in neuroblastoma cells led to cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . in support of the important functions of the highly expressed exosomal mirnas, our go-based target prediction showed their potential roles in phosphorylation, rna splicing, chromosomal abnormality, and angiogenesis; however, these predictions need further functional confirmation. clearly, once released into target cells, the highly enriched mirnas may participate directly in the regulation of mrna translation and influence cell functions.

we also observed low level of “long” rna fragments such as mrna and lncrna in the small rna sequencing libraries. our library preparation protocols were designed to capture small non-coding rnas . therefore, the mrnas and lncrnas that were identified in this study should all be treated as fragmented rnas. the procedures that were used for rna extraction and library preparation may have caused partial rna degradation, enabling the detection of fragments of the long rnas in the small rna libraries. another possible explanation for the presence of long rna fragments is that the exosomes also function as a “reservoir” to remove degraded mrna and lncrna derived from the cytosol. the exact mechanism underlying the presence of fragmented long rnas in exosomes remains to be unraveled.

the current study demonstrated the reproducibility for each library preparation kit. both pearson correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis showed highly correlated rna profiles between technical replicates, suggesting the consistency of these commercial kits. however, the study also showed significant biases between the library preparation methods. each kit preferentially captured specific rna sequences. for high abundant rnas, this bias does not seem to be problematic because all three kits detected these rnas. for low abundant rnas, however, the bias could be an issue because these rnas may be detected by one kit but not by another. protocol-based bias may also create problems in data interpretation if different commercial kits are used. we suggest that separate validation using qpcr should be performed for all sequencing-based detections.

the ever growing number of novel sequences in the mirna database implies that human mirna annotation is far from complete  <cit> . to identify novel mirnas, next generation sequencing is the most powerful and the most popular approach. however, systematic bias during library preparation and the limited power of prediction algorithms means that some of the novel mirnas may have been falsely predicted. we strongly recommended using other complementary methods such as northern blot and qpcr for subsequent validation. additionally, this study used only three plasma samples and, therefore, our findings may not fully represent all exosomal rnas in human populations. to completely survey the exosomal transcriptome more samples from diverse populations and with different disease status are required.

the plasma exosomes are believed to be derived from a variety of cell populations. their heterogeneous origin may limit the detection of disease-specific exosomes in peripheral blood samples. vast numbers of exosomes shed from other cell types may dilute the exosome population derived from tumor cells, significantly reducing the proportion of tumor-derived mirnas in the sequencing libraries. because the less common tumor-derived mirna may be a direct reflection of the disease status and critical for tumor development, the increased read depth of rna sequencing is required. it is worth mentioning, that although the detection of rare rna transcripts will increase as sequencing depth increases, the rare sequences still account for a tiny fraction of the exosomal rnas. whether or not the rare exosomal mirnas are functional remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a comprehensive data-generation and data-analysis pipeline that includes exosome isolation, rna extraction, library preparation, rna sequencing, and rna annotation. our data show that plasma-derived exosomes contain diverse rna species, in particular, mirna. the abundance of the exosomal rnas varies dramatically. some highly abundant mirnas may play critical roles after being transferred to target cells. the three commercial small rna preparation kits that we tested generated sufficient dna fragments for sequencing but had significant biases towards capturing specific rnas. the use of large-scale rna sequencing will ensure the discovery and characterization of the whole transcriptome  of the blood-derived exosomes, which has not been completely examined so far. a fully characterized transcriptome will help gain a better understanding of exosome-mediated molecular mechanisms and will contribute to biomarker discovery. it is expected that the blood-based sequencing assay described here will find clinical applications as a biomarker discovery tool for disease diagnosis and prognosis.
