BACKGROUND
pseudogenes are “fossil” copies of functional genes that have lost their potential as dna templates for functional products  <cit> . while the definition of pseudogenes is still somewhat fuzzy, most of them are defined operationally by bioinformatics criteria, e.g., genomic scans of signatures of homology to known genes. ribosomal protein  pseudogenes represent the largest class of pseudogenes found in the human genome: over  <dig> ribosomal protein pseudogenes are identified by bioinformatics scan of genomic sequence  <cit> .

these pseudogenes are commonly thought to be non-functional due to the lack of promoters and/or the presence of loss of function mutations. indeed, the vast majority of these pseudogenes either carry dysfunctional mutations such as in-frame stop codons, or lack of proper regulatory sequences, such as promoters, mtop signals, and first introns  <cit> . interestingly, three rp pseudogenes, with 89%-95% sequence identity to their parent  rp genes, were found to be transcribed and seem to be functional, by a bioinformatics scan of cdna and expression sequence tag  databases and confirmation by pcr and northern blot  <cit> . a genome-wide bioinformatics scan identified over  <dig> potential pseudogenes  <cit> . moreover, it was found  <cit>  that the six rp pseudogenes shared at syntenic loci between the human and the mouse genomes are more conserved than other rp pseudogenes.

however, data were lacking to experimentally validate pseudogene expression. it is unclear from the literature whether the reported cases are merely anecdotal or that pseudogenes do play some cellular roles. this is largely hindered by the lack of methods for the identification of pseudogenes transcription. the traditional method of transcriptome profiling, gene expression microarray, is not sensitive in distinguishing transcripts among very similar gene sequences.

recent advancements of next-generation sequencing allow for direct massive transcriptome sequencing , and thus providing unprecedented insights into all transcribed sequences. for example, rna-seq has been applied to detect complex transcriptional activities such as alternative splicing  <cit>  and allelic-specific expression  <cit> . recently, rna-seq has been applied to reveal rna editing events  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, there were yet no attempts to detect the transcription of pseudogenes in rna-seq data. the main challenge for pseudogene identification in rna-seq data is the difficulty of high fidelity read mapping. because sequences of pseudogenes are highly similar to the sequences of the mrnas of the parent genes, specialized read mapping methods are required to detect reads unambiguously generated from pseudogenes.

in this study, we conduct a bioinformatics analysis of pseudogene expression using rna-sequencing data of  <dig> human tissues of the illumina human body map  <dig>  project. we first describe our new computational pipeline for detecting pseudogene expression that disentangles sequencing reads of pseudogenes from those of the parent genes, with consideration of possible mismatches due to snps and rna-editing. this is followed by a description of our findings and a discussion of their implications.

RESULTS
illumina human body map  <dig>  rna-seq data
the human body map  <dig>  project by illumina generated rna-seq data for  <dig> different human tissues . in our analysis we used the 75 bps single read data, with one lane of hiseq  <dig> data per tissue. standard mrna-seq library preps were used to extract poly-a selected mrnas.

discovery of pseudogene transcription in rna-seq data
our primary goal is to detect transcriptional activities of any of the  <dig> processed rp pseudogenes. in addition, we also want to provide a preliminary quantification of their level of transcription.

we developed a novel bioinformatics approach for detecting the subtle signals of pseudogene expression. briefly, we first compiled a “composite genome” consisting of known rp gene spliced mrna sequences and the human genome   <cit> . we then mapped rna-seq reads to the composite genome using bowtie  <cit> , allowing no mismatches and discarding reads mapped to more than one locus. thus we ensured that the reads mapped to rp pseudogenes are neither from repetitive regions nor from normal rp genes. on average 89% of the reads aligning to rp pseudogenes can also be mapped to real rp spliced mrna sequences and are removed when mapped to the composite genome . furthermore, to remove mapped reads that may be caused by snps and rna-editing, we extended the concept of the mappability   <cit>  and masked regions in rp pseudogenes that are duplicated in the composite genome within  <dig> mismatches over the 75 bps read length. the number of reads we removed from non-unique locations in both the composite genome and hg <dig> genome can be seen in table  <dig>  the mappability regions only correspond to the unaltered human genome locations, so all reads mapped to rp gene mrna sequences in the composite genome are removed during this step. additionally, the composite genome alignment lacks the reads that mapped both to the unaltered human genome locations and spliced rp gene mrna sequences as we only retained reads aligning to a single location. with both of these groups of reads removed, the number of reads mapped uniquely in the composite genome is always less than that in the unaltered human genome. finally, we calculated the transcription levels, as measured by the reads per kilobase per million reads   <cit>  of all pseudogenes according to the mapped reads in their mappable regions. as a benchmark for normal expression levels, we also aligned reads to an unaltered genome using tophat and measured fpkm of all refseq genes using cufflinks  <cit> . the alignment information of reads to the composite genome, and to the unaltered genome , can be seen in table  <dig>  please see methods for details.

the ratio is calculated by the number of mapped reads from the composite genome over the number of mapped reads from the unaltered human genome .

the number of reads mapped to the composite genome  and to the unaltered human genome , and the number of reads overlapped with uniqueome  for both are shown. for the composite genome, the number of reads aligning to the entire composite genome and the unaltered hg <dig> human genome are shown.

prevalent transcription of rp pseudogenes
the expression levels of the top seventeen highly expressed ribosomal protein pseudogenes in  <dig> human tissues are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> . as expected the majority of pseudogenes have no reads aligning to their sequence. interestingly, there were some pseudogenes with high expression levels. one rp pseudogene  is transcribed with rpkm  <dig> in thyroid. moreover, three additional rp pseudogenes are transcribed with rpkm >  <dig>  furthermore, thirteen more rp pseudogenes are of rpkm >  <dig>  we describe pseudogenes with an rpkm >  <dig> as “highly expressed”, with the understanding that they may be only representing the top 10– <dig> percentile of all  <dig>  refseq genes in the human body map  <dig>  data set, while rpkm >  <dig> represents the top 20– <dig> percentile . below we discuss these cases in detail.

expression levels of pseudogenes with their pseudogene id  are measured in terms of rpkm. only pseudogenes with maximum rpkm >  <dig> are shown. tissue specificities are measured by the js divergence  <cit> . read coverage is the ratio of pseudogene exon length covered by uniquely mapped reads to the total pseudogene exon length.

percentile columns represent the percentage of refseq genes in all tissues with fpkm above a given value.

pgohum- <dig>  an rpl <dig> pseudogene, is expressed with rpkm =  <dig> in thyroid . this highest expressed rp pseudogene is located in an intron of the thyroglobulin  gene. the tg gene is highly and specifically expressed in the same tissue, thyroid, and the gene encodes a glycoprotein that acts as a substrate for the synthesis of thyroxine and triiodothyronine as well as the storage of the inactive forms of thyroid hormone and iodine  <cit> . the transcription of this pseudogene goes beyond the annotated pseudogene region, but is less than the entire intron region. although the pseudogene is specifically expressed in the same tissue as tg, the rp coding frame is on the reverse strand of the tg gene. therefore, it is possible that this pseudogene is on a distinct transcript other than the tg gene. moreover, according to ucsc genome browser  <cit> , this pseudogene region is only conserved within the primates , but not in other mammalian and vertebrate lineages. as a side note, the genome browser shows a peculiar conservation pattern between human and the stickleback fish, but it is likely to be an artifact of matching human genomic sequence with the rpl <dig> gene of stickleback fish.

three additional pseudogenes are highly transcribed . pgohum- <dig>  an rpl7a pseudogene, is expressed rpkm =  <dig> in white blood cells. this pseudogene is located in an intergenic region. also, the transcription unit seems to span a longer region . it is transcribed in a white blood cell specific fashion. pgohum- <dig>  an rps <dig> pseudogene, is expressed in kidney. this pseudogene is located in the intronic region of gene slc12a <dig> . this gene encodes a renal thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter that is important for electrolyte homeostasis. pgohum- <dig>  an rps <dig> pseudogene, is expressed in testes. this pseudogene is located in an intergenic region . the comparison of read coverage with or without uniqueome filtering for these four rp pseudogenes can be been in figures s1-s <dig> in additional file  <dig> 

tissue-specificity of pseudogene transcription
many genes are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion. the human body map  <dig>  data allow us to study the tissue-specificity of transcriptions of these pseudogenes. we adopt the entropy-based jensen-shannon  divergence measure used in  <cit> . the distributions of tissue-specificity js divergences of rp pseudogenes versus rp genes are shown in figure  <dig>  in the human body map  <dig>  data set, all rp genes are not transcribed in a tissue specific fashion  . unlike ribosomal protein genes that are constitutively expressed in almost all tissues, many rp pseudogenes are differentially expressed . among the seventeen pseudogenes with rpkm >  <dig> at some tissue,  <dig> of them have a js divergence >  <dig> . in fact, all of the top  <dig> pseudogenes with rpkm >  <dig> are transcribed in a highly tissue specific fashion . these results suggest that these highly expressed rp pseudogenes may contribute to tissue-specific biological processes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of the pseudogenes of ribosomal protein genes in diverse human tissues. using our specialized pipeline, we identified several cases of pseudogene expression. most notably, one pseudogene in an intron of the tg gene is extremely highly expressed in thyroid. moreover, several other pseudogenes are also highly expressed. we found that many pseudogenes are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion. also, the expression of pseudogenes seems to often go beyond the boundaries of the annotated pseudogenes. apparently, further experimental investigations will be needed to reveal the biological relevance of these expressions.

transcriptome sequencing, rna-seq, provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover many complexities of cellular gene expression. a key computational challenge in rna-seq data analysis is to discern reads among multiple potential sources with similar sequences. in this work we focused on the detection of evidences of pseudogene expression. we used extremely strict read mapping criteria to minimize potential false positives. admittedly we did not utilize all potential reads, especially at regions with low uniqueness. further research may consider using looser mapping criteria combined with sophisticated statistical algorithms to take into account the mapping ambiguity.

the bioinformatics methods presented here may find application in other rna-seq studies dealing with high similarity in reference sequences. in particular, the same methodology may be able to identify differential expression between other homologous genome regions. studies in other fields, such as metagenomics, dealing with high similarity dna sequences may also find benefits from strict alignment and intersection with uniquely mappable locations.
