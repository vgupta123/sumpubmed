BACKGROUND
the discovery of small rnas  as ubiquitous regulators of gene expression in the last decade represents fertile ground for scientific advances in both fundamental biology and potential applications in medicine. bacterial srnas vary in length from ~50- <dig> nucleotides and are generally encoded in the intergenic regions  of dna  <cit> . the majority of srnas function as negative regulators by base-pairing with the 5′ untranslated region  of target mrnas to prevent translation by sterically blocking the ribosome binding site and reducing the stability of the mrna. bacterial srnas hybridize in short discontinuous stretches of sequence with limited complementarity, and are thus able to base pair with multiple mrnas to regulate a complex network of genes that underpin diverse cellular behaviors. the post-transcriptional regulator and rna chaperone hfq has been shown to facilitate base pairing between bacterial srnas and mrna targets  <cit> .

srnas modulate the expression levels of target genes in response to specific environmental changes. for example, the escherichia coli srna, ryhb, inhibits expression of ~ <dig> proteins that play a role in iron acquisition under iron-limiting conditions to ensure that scarce iron is available for more essential cell processes  <cit> . another srna, sgrs, is expressed under metabolic stress conditions when e. coli is unable to metabolize intracellular phosphorylated sugars  <cit> . in addition, bacterial srnas have been found to regulate expression of virulence genes in a variety of pathogens during host infection, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium <cit> .

the first known srnas, primarily from e. coli, were identified fortuitously by the direct detection of highly abundant rnas  or in the context of protein-focused studies   <cit> . in the last decade, global analytical approaches, such as gene expression microarrays and deep sequencing, have begun to systematically reveal srna populations in a wide variety of bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes <cit> , listeria pneumophila <cit> , yersinia pseudotuberculosis <cit> , and s. typhimurium <cit> . these analyses have generated hundreds of srna candidates that are actively being investigated to determine their functional activities. however, these studies have generally limited srna expression profiling to one or a few different bacterial growth conditions. given that srna expression is highly dependent on a specific environment, we sought to profile differential srna expression levels in response to a wider variety of growth conditions and cell stimuli.

we examined srna expression profiles in the gram-negative bacterial genus, burkholderia, which encompasses ~ <dig> species that exhibit a wide range of biological functions, including pathogenicity, bioremediation, and nitrogen fixation. the two best-characterized species, b. pseudomallei and b. mallei, the causative agents of human melioidosis and equine glanders, respectively, are categorized as category b biothreat agents by the cdc. we designed and constructed a microarray that contains probe sets to all igrs longer than  <dig> bases using genome annotations from b. thailandensis, a closely-related attenuated species to b. pseudomallei. b. thailandensis was cultured under  <dig> distinct growth conditions that varied media, temperature, salt, ph, nutrient limitations, and several poisons, such as antibiotics and ethanol. from this analysis, we identified  <dig> novel srnas,  <dig> of which are also present in b. pseudomallei and b. mallei. experimental validation suggested that some srnas play a role in adaptation of burkholderia to antibiotic exposure and survival in a host-specific environment.

RESULTS
differential b. thailandensis srna expression profiles in response to stress
we obtained  <dig> gene expression profiles from b. thailandensis cultured in  <dig> distinct growth conditions to identify novel srnas that regulate stress adaptation. the expression profiles were obtained using a custom affymetrix microarray containing probes to most b. thailandensis genes and all igrs greater than  <dig> bases. the majority of profiles  were from four time course studies measuring changes in temperature, ph, salt and phosphate concentrations . the remaining  <dig> experiments included a wide range of conditions assessing nutrient limitations, deprivation of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or magnesium, and several poisons such as antibiotics, ethanol, peroxide, and salicylate. we analyzed the  <dig> probe sets targeting the igrs in the four time course studies and used the following criteria to identify candidate srnas:  probes that did not have similar fold changes and expression levels as the immediate flanking genes,  two or more probes forming a single peak spanning a minimum of  <dig> bases, and  overlapping srna and transcription terminator predictions.table  <dig>

we observed the presense of both cis-encoded and trans-encoded srnas . many of the top-ranked igrs exhibited similar expression levels to a flanking gene, suggesting potential cis-encoded regulation, as seen for the thermoregulator cspa, which resides upstream of bth_i <dig> . however, burkholderia genomes have a high gc content and inconsistent gene start predictions  <cit> . over half the genes in the b. thailandensis genome have an alternate start site in other gene models. therefore, many of the cis-encoded candidate srnas may be false positives, representing mrna from genes for which the translation start site should be extended upstream. given this difficulty in predicting gene start sites and 5′ utrs, we excluded the majority of cis-encoded srnas from further study, except for candidate srnas  that were characterized by a single peak upstream from a gene with little or no expression.figure  <dig>

all the srna sequences were blasted against burkholderia genomes from  <dig> different species to determine their phyogenetic distribution . of the  <dig> srnas,  <dig> srnas were unique to b. thailandensis. bth_s <dig> was present in both b. thailandensis and b. pseudomallei. twelve srnas were found in b. thailandensis and the two pathogenic strains b. pseudomallei and b. mallei. eight other srnas were found in other burkholderia species, in addition to b. thailandensis and the two pathogenic strains, and only the two known srnas, rnasep and srp, were present in all burkholderia strains analyzed. we chose to further validate five novel srnas, including the trans-encoded bth_s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  and the cis-encoded bth_s <dig> and s <dig>  based on their presence in pathogenic burkholderia and/or higher expression in response to antibiotic treatment .

trans-encoded srnas in burkholderia
the trans-encoded bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> exhibited modestly higher expression levels in response to antibiotic exposure compared to untreated control cells and were expressed independently from their flanking genes . we observed a single major transcript for bth_s <dig> using northern blot analysis in exponentially-growing bacteria . bth_s <dig> was mapped to the 3′ utr of a conserved protein-coding gene, bth_ii <dig>  based on prediction of a transcription terminator sequence immediately following bth_s <dig> . however, we demonstrated that bth_s <dig> was processed as an independent transcript from bth_ii <dig> by northern blot . using rapid amplification of cdna ends , we determined the size of bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> to be  <dig> and  <dig> nt, respectively, and mapped the genomic coordinates.  based on gene expression analysis using our b. thailandensis microarray, we determined that the expression profiles of bth_s <dig> and bth_ii <dig> are similar under some growth conditions, such as phosphate starvation and exposure to antibiotics, but significantly differ in response to other stress factors, such as elevated temperature  or acidic environment , suggesting that expression for both transcripts is highly regulated, but can be divergent . importantly, bth_s <dig> shares >90% sequence similarity across a wide range of burkholderia species, while bth_ii <dig> is conserved only between b. thailandensis, b. pseudomallei, and b. mallei, suggesting that bth_s <dig> regulatory function is highly conserved.figure  <dig>

both bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> were expressed at low levels in exponentially-growing  b. thailandensis and reached maximal levels at stationary phase  . growth of the b. thailandensis cdc <dig> strain is inhibited by gentamycin at > <dig> μg/ml and kanamycin at > <dig> μg/ml. when exposed to sublethal concentrations of both antibiotics, bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> levels were upregulated in exponentially-growing bacteria, but downregulated in bacteria at stationary phase. these results were further validated by qpcr , although bth_s <dig> exhibited little change in expression in response to kanamycin at exponential phase using this method. a third trans-encoded srna, bth_s <dig>  displayed a different expression profile from bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig>  with relatively little change in response to antibiotics during exponential growth, but significantly increased expression at stationary phase. in addition to antibiotics, we also stimulated b. thailandensis in lb media containing serum and observed strong induction of bth_s <dig> and significant reduction of bth_s <dig> in both growth phases, which are reversed expression profiles to that seen with antibiotic treatment especially at stationary phase . these data suggest that bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> have opposing regulatory functions in bacterial adaptation to antibiotics and host serum.figure  <dig>

based on the high expression levels of bth_s <dig> in response to multiple stimuli , we expected that burkholderia defective for bth_s <dig> expression may exhibit physiological changes in stress response or virulence. to examine the effect of a bth_s <dig> knockdown in burkholderia, we overexpressed an antisense transcript to bth_s <dig> and isolated bacterial clones with ~85% reduction in bth_s <dig> levels . bth_s39-defective b. thailandensis grew at a slower rate compared to a wild-type strain in host media containing serum . we also observed that infection of thp- <dig> macrophage cells with the bth_s39-defective strain led to increased host survival compared to infection with the wild-type strain . finally, thp- <dig> cells infected with the bth_s39-defective strain expressed only half of the chemokine il- <dig> and adhesion molecule icam- <dig> transcript levels compared to thp- <dig> cells infected with the wild-type strain . taken together, these data demonstrate that bth_s <dig> is required for pathogen adaptation to a host-specific environment containing serum. exposure to serum has been shown to stimulate the expression of bacterial genes that impact the host immune response  <cit> .figure  <dig>

srnas encoded in the 5′utr of target genes
during analysis of srna sequences, we noted that several igrs contained potential cis-encoded srnas in the 5′ utr. we selected two srnas, bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig>  that were characterized by a single peak immediately upstream from their poorly-expressed cognate protein-coding genes, bth_i <dig> and bth_i <dig>  respectively . both bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> expression were up-regulated >3-fold when b. thailandensis was exposed to the antibiotics mixture. we validated the predicted genomic coordinates of bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> using race and observed that the resultant pcr products exhibited heterogeneous migration, in contrast to a single predominant band that we observed for bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> . sequencing of the pcr products revealed that bth_s <dig> and sbth_ <dig> were expressed as multiple subspecies of processed transcripts , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, respectively. several of the srna subspecies extended into their cognate downstream coding gene by >100nt, suggesting that the srna and downstream gene may be expressed as one transcript that subsequently undergoes degradation and/or cleavage by site-specific enzymatic rna processing as a mechanism for gene downregulation.figure  <dig>

the gene immediately downstream of bth_s <dig>  bth_i <dig>  encodes soluble lytic transglycosylase , an enzyme that cleaves the glycosidic linkage between n-acetylmuramoyl and n-acetylglucosaminyl residues within peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to create space for the insertion of membrane-spanning structures, such as flagella and the type iii secretion system, during cell division  <cit> . given that the cell wall is essential for bacterial viability, we expect expression of slt to require stringent regulation. from race analysis, we also observed heterogeneous migration of slt transcripts , similar to what we observed for bth_s <dig>  suggesting that slt transcripts are also degraded and short-lived. both bth_s <dig>  and slt  transcripts undergo degradation when b. thailandensis is grown in conditioned host media , as demonstrated by northern blot . to further investigate bth_s <dig> expression during pathogenesis, we infected thp- <dig> macrophages with b. thailandensis separated into two fractions: extracellular  bacteria that remained in the medium, and phagocytosed intracellular  pathogen released by detergent-induced host cell lysis. interestingly, the ic fraction exhibited higher levels of full-length slt  and 300-400nt transcript fragments, compared to barely detectable slt transcript in the ec fraction, suggesting that slt expression is needed for intracellular survival and proliferation during infection. for extracellular bacteria, cell wall fortification is likely required to resist microbicidal peptides produced by macrophages, thus leading to significant reduction of slt expression.

by qpcr, we observed that the levels of bth_s <dig> were ~10-fold higher than the slt transcripts in bacteria grown in kanamycin , serum-containing media , or the ec fraction . in the ic fraction however, the increase in slt transcript accumulation was offset by a ~4-fold decrease in the bth_s <dig> levels as compared to the ec fraction or bacteria grown in host media. in sum, our results suggest that bth_s <dig> regulates slt gene expression on a posttranscriptional level to fine tune slt protein accumulation.

we also investigated bth_s <dig>  located in the 5′utr of the coding gene bth_i <dig>  from race analysis, we recovered two bth_s <dig> subspecies that extended into the 5′ end of bth_i <dig> by either + <dig> or +150nt.  the race and northern blot data collectively indicated that full-length bth_s <dig> transcripts  were expressed in b. thailandensis grown in lb during log phase and in response to serum and conditioned host media , but were subjected to rapid degradation  . the relatively low level of full-length transcript may be indicative of tight gene regulation, suggesting that bth_i <dig> encodes a protein whose accumulation may burden the cell. we also observed that bth_s <dig> and bth_i <dig> transcript levels were markedly suppressed when b. thailandensis was cultured in lb containing inhibitory concentrations of kanamycin , suggesting a role in adaptation to antibiotic exposure . this role was further underscored by the significant accumulation of bth_s <dig> transcripts in bacteria grown under suboptimal antibiotic concentrations . unlike bth_s <dig>  bth_s <dig> expression was up-regulated in the ec fraction of b. thailandensis compared to bacteria cultured in lb or rpmi . by qpcr, we also observed that bth_s <dig> accumulation was relatively reduced in the ic fraction compared to levels of bth_i <dig> transcripts . taken together our data on cis-encoded bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> present a conserved mechanism of post-transcriptional gene dosage control by destabilization of downstream cognate mrnas.

notably, alignment of bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> sequences across pathogenic burkholderia indicated a higher sequence identity  compared to their cognate downstream coding genes, bth_i1527/slt and bth_i <dig> , suggesting that these srnas may have conserved regulatory functions.

prediction of srna targets using coprarna
to identify potential target genes for b. thailandensis srnas, we used the comparative prediction algorithm for srna targets  on the experimentally-validated srnas  <cit>  . the top targets for both cis-encoded srnas, bth_s <dig> and s <dig>  were correctly identified as their respective downstream genes. interestingly, the number of targets under the q-value threshold for the cis-acting srnas bth_s <dig> and s <dig>  was larger compared to the trans-encoded srnas bth_s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> . many of these predictions may be valid targets. for example, the second target prediction of bth_s <dig> is the osmolarity response regulator ompr , which is coded on the opposite strand  <dig> bases upstream. given that the predicted binding site is at position - <dig> to - <dig>  it is likely that bth_s <dig> is an antisense regulator of the 5′ utr of ompr as well. for trans-encoded srnas, there is little correlation between the genomic location of the srna and its cognate mrna targets. the top targets for the trans-encoded bth_s <dig> and s <dig> were phage proteins with multiple copies on three or more genomic islands. bth_s <dig> is found immediately downstream of bth_ii <dig> in the 3′ utr region, but this gene was not found in the list of top  <dig> potential targets for bth_s <dig>  further confirming the independence of the transcript as seen by northern blot . genes regulating key pathways for energy production, phosphorus metabolism, and oxidative stress were found amongst the top ten predicted targets for bth_s <dig>  which is consistent with the s <dig> expression profile .table  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we identified  <dig> b. thailandensis srnas that are differentially expressed in response to  <dig> distinct growth and stimulatory conditions. the srnas included highly-expressed srnas in practically all growth conditions , poorly-expressed srnas , and stress-induced srnas specifically regulated in response to toxic stimuli . of the  <dig> novel srnas,  <dig> displayed high sequence conservation between b. thailandensis and the two pathogenic strains, b. pseudomallei and b. mallei. the five srnas we characterized in-depth were in this category. in particular, bth_s <dig> is one of the most highly-expressed srnas in cells exposed to environmental stress factors and may play a conserved essential role similar to the two highly-expressed known srnas, rnasep and srp. indeed, knockdown of bth_s <dig> expression by antisense transcripts led to inhibition of b. thailandensis growth in a host-specific environment and attenuation of host cell death and cytokine expression upon host infection , indicating that bth_s <dig> functions both in adaptation to environmental growth and pathogenicity mechanisms.

srnas have been identified in studies of other burkholderia species. deep sequencing of burkholderia cenocepacia grown in two different conditions, a soil environment and an infection model, led to identification of thirteen novel srnas  <cit> . twelve of these srnas were specifically induced in soil, suggesting that these srnas modulate bacterial survival under suboptimal growth conditions. a recent comprehensive transcriptomics study of b. pseudomallei grown under  <dig> environmental conditions was performed using whole genome tiling  <cit> . of  <dig> condition-dependent srnas identified,  <dig> shared high sequence identity and chromosomal synteny with b. thailandensis. similar to the b. cenocepacia study, relatively few  srnas were associated with host infection, although media supplemented with host factors stimulated expression of a higher number of srnas . these differences in srna expression levels under host conditions may stem from competing stress factors in the host environment, such as low o <dig> or iron levels, change in carbon source, and exposure to microbicidal agents. furthermore, the comparatively low abundance of bacteria-derived srnas compared to the host-derived rna population can confound detection of less abundant srnas required for bacterial adaptation to the host. moreover, srnas with high sequence conservation between bacterial species may not follow the same expression pattern under equal growth conditions due to distinct genetic backgrounds.

there are still challenges to be addressed in the discovery and classification of srnas. in many cases, slight discrepancies in growth conditions can result in markedly different srna expression profiles by independent research groups  <cit> . many filtering criteria exclude srnas < <dig> bp. in the case of bth_s <dig>  we found that the most abundant transcript was  <dig> bp. bth_s <dig> was not identified by the b. pseudomallei transcriptome analysis, which had excluded rna transcripts < <dig> bp  <cit> . other studies exclude rna transcripts located in the 5′ or 3′ utrs of annotated genes, assuming that these rnas were cis regulatory elements of the flanking gene. we demonstrated that bth_s <dig> was expressed independently of its upstream flanking gene bth_ii <dig> under various growth conditions. we included these transcripts since they can resist degradation and accumulate in bacteria, and thus have the potential to exert regulatory control not only on their flanking genes, but also target other trans-encoded transcripts.

although the predicted srna targets from the coprarna target identification analysis remain to be experimentally validated, it was surprising to identify more potential targets for the cis-acting bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> srnas compared to the trans-acting bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig>  another distinctive feature of the cis-acting srnas characterized in our study was the degree of their sequence conservation  across pathogenic burkholderia, which was greater than that of their flanking cognate genes. we demonstrated that the processing of bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> caused degradation of the downstream gene, and the ratio between the srnas located in the 5′utr versus the transcript levels of the downstream coding gene was always > <dig> . these observations indicate that the cis-acting srnas are likely to be co-transcribed with their flanking cognate gene, and srna processing executes post-transcriptional gene dosage control.

the sequence conservation of bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> between several burkholderia species suggests that these srnas play an essential regulatory role. one possible function of these srnas is the riboswitch, a highly-conserved family of cis-regulatory rnas by both sequence and structure, that responds to changes in intracellular concentrations of metabolites and secondary messengers to attenuate transcription/translation by competing with either a terminator stem-loop or a shine-delgarno element  <cit> . to date, only the glms riboswitch is known to undergo ligand binding-induced self-cleavage that destabilizes the mrna in which it resides, leading to mrna degradation by rnase j <dig>  <cit> . we are currently investigating whether bth_s <dig> and bth_s <dig> can function as riboswitches via binding to specific metabolites or secondary messengers to protect bacteria from accumulation of cytotoxic transcripts  <cit> .

we also observed that bth_i <dig>  the downstream cognate gene of bth_s <dig>  is in close proximity to genes activated by oxidative stress. bth_i <dig> is located immediately downstream of the two component system riss/risa, which has been linked to bordetella pathogenicity and is optimally expressed in the intracellular niche  <cit> . genes that encode for antioxidant protein , alkyl hydroperoxide reductase d , and transcription-repair coupling factor  are located further upstream of riss. these genes are induced upon exposure to antibiotics, oxidizing agents , iron/manganese depletion, or ionizing radiation . we found that bth_s <dig> accumulated in b. thailandensis exposed to a sub-lethal dose of kanamycin included in a cocktail of antibiotics to which the bacteria is naturally resistant , whereas bth_s <dig> levels were significantly reduced in bacteria exposed to inhibitory concentrations of kanamycin . these data support a role for bth_s <dig> in mediating antibiotic resistance.

the downstream cognate gene of bth_s <dig>  slt, functions in bacterial cell wall remodeling during cell division and the formation of macromolecule virulence complexes such as the secretion systems, t3ss and t6ss  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that slt transcription was inhibited when bacteria was exposed to conditioned host medium, which contains antibacterial peptides, indicating that slt expression is downregulated when bacterial cell walls need to be fortified in order to resist microbicidal peptides produced by immune cells . in contrast, slt levels were relatively higher in intracellular bacteria, which correlates with a need for cell wall remodeling upon t6ss formation and secretion of virulence proteins, to support intracellular survival and proliferation. the t6sss were identified as major virulence factors essential for intracellular growth, actin polymerization, and formation of multi-nucleate giant cells  <cit> . expression of t6ss gene clusters in pathogenic burkholderia was found to be limited exclusively to intracellular bacteria  <cit> . interestingly, we observed inhibition of 5′ utr degradation  in intracellular bacteria, suggesting that bth_s <dig> may serve as a post-transcriptional regulator of slt to control production of an autolytic enzyme in response to specific growth conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies provide a broad analysis of differential burkholderia srna expression profiles and illustrate the complexity of bacterial gene regulation in response to different environmental stress conditions. given that a specific srna profile is expressed only in response to specific stressors, it may be the case that the current list of annotated srnas represents only a small fraction of the total srna repertoire that can possibly be expressed. we characterized trans-encoded srnas, bth_s <dig> and s <dig>  that exhibited differential expression profiles dependent on growth phase and cell stimuli. the downstream mrna targets for most bacterial trans-encoded srnas remain unknown. we expect that bioinformatics approaches such as the coprarna algorithm can downselect candidate mrna targets for follow-on experimentation. we are currently validating the mrna targets for specific srnas predicted by coprarna. we have also found that cis-encoded srnas, such as bth_s <dig> and s <dig>  may be expressed as single transcripts in tandem with their cognate downstream genes and subsequently undergo rna degradation. this mechanism represents a novel rna-mediated strategy for post-transcriptional gene dosage to tightly control expression of cognate downstream genes.

we expect that further functional and mechanistic studies of regulatory rnas will reveal additional mechanisms of gene regulation. our lab has recently performed single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization  on a novel y. pestis srna, yop_s <dig>  implicated in virulence, to quantify precise srna copy number and model dynamics of srna expression in response to a temperature shift  <cit> . a comprehensive approach to analyze srna function and dynamics will provide a better mechanistic understanding of the complexity of srna-mediated gene expression in response to different niche stressors.
