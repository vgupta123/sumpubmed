BACKGROUND
in marine ecosystems, nitrate  serves as both a nitrogen source for assimilation and an electron acceptor for dissimilatory processes when oxygen  is deficient. the latter scenario is ubiquitously encountered in anoxic sediment layers, but also prevails in the water bodies of oxygen minimum zones  of the world’s oceans
 <cit> . in denitrification, nitrate is sequentially reduced to dinitrogen
no3−→no2−→no→n2o→n <dig>  in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium , nitrate is sequentially reduced to ammonium
no3−→no2−→nh4+, and in anaerobic ammonium oxidation , ammonium is oxidized by nitrite to form dinitrogen
nh4++no2−→n <dig>  these different metabolic pathways of dissimilatory
no3− or
no2− reduction were originally thought to only occur in prokaryotes
 <cit> . meanwhile, denitrification and dnra have been discovered in a limited set of eukaryotic microorganisms, including marine foraminifers
 <cit>  and diatoms
 <cit> . incomplete denitrification to nitrous oxide  has also been proven for plant-pathogenic and soil fungi, such as fusarium oxysporum <cit> , but so far not for marine isolates. additionally, a large number of fungal species, mainly belonging to ascomycota, are capable of “ammonia fermentation”, a form of
no3− reduction to ammonium
nh4+ coupled to the fermentation of organic compounds
 <cit> .

fungi are primarily aerobic heterotrophs, but some species, especially fermentative yeasts, can survive and grow under completely anoxic conditions. nevertheless, both the abundance and the ecological role of fungi in o2-deficient marine environments are probably underestimated
 <cit> . recent sequencing approaches revealed a large diversity of marine microbial eukaryotes in environments where o <dig> occurs in low concentrations or is completely absent
 <cit> . additionally, it was found that fungal 18s rdna sequences dominate the eukaryotic microbial communities in anoxic marine habitats . fungi retrieved from coastal marine sediments are dominated by ascomycota that may be of terrestrial origin
 <cit> . amongst others, they are represented by aspergillus species, including a. terreus <cit> . fungal community structures differ between oxic, seasonally anoxic, and permanently anoxic sites, suggesting adaptation of fungal communities to prevailing o <dig> conditions
 <cit> .

the arabian sea harbors two different o2-deficient conditions, which includes a seasonal omz along the continental shelf and an open-ocean, perennial omz
 <cit> . the distribution of anaerobic nitrogen cycling in the arabian sea is patchy and covers areas with predominant denitrification
 <cit>  or anammox activity
 <cit> . the arabian sea is also a globally important site of n2o emission
 <cit> . the oversaturation of the water column with this potent greenhouse gas is ascribed to denitrification activity
 <cit> .

here, the ecophysiology of an a. terreus isolate  obtained from the seasonal omz in the arabian sea was studied. an- <dig> was enriched from coastal sediment sampled during a period of bottom-water anoxia using anoxic,
no3−-amended conditions. it was therefore hypothesized that an- <dig> is capable of dissimilatory no3- reduction. the role of o <dig> and
no3− availability in triggering dissimilatory no3- reduction was studied in axenic incubations. in a dedicated 15n-labeling experiment, all environmentally relevant products of dissimilatory
no3− reduction were determined. intracellular
no3− storage, a common trait of no3--respiring eukaryotes, was studied combining freeze-thaw cycles and ultrasonication for lysing
no3−-storing cells. production of cellular energy and biomass enabled by dissimilatory
no3− reduction was assessed with atp and protein measurements, respectively. using these experimental strategies, we present the first evidence for dissimilatory
no3− reduction by an ascomycete fungus that is known from a broad range of habitats, but here was isolated from a marine environment.

RESULTS
aerobic and anaerobic nitrate and ammonium turnover
the fate of
no3− added to the liquid media of axenic an- <dig> cultures  was followed during aerobic and anaerobic cultivation , in a 15n-labeling experiment involving an oxic-anoxic shift , and in a cultivation experiment that addressed the intracellular storage of
no3− . nitrate was generally consumed, irrespective of o <dig> availability ,
2a , and
3a + b ). under oxic conditions,
no3− concentrations in the liquid media exhibited sudden drops when high biomass production and/or
nh4+ depletion was noted in the culture flasks . under anoxic conditions, however,
no3− concentrations in the liquid media decreased steadily over the whole incubation period during which neither sudden increases in biomass production, nor
nh4+depletion were noted .

the fate of
nh4+ was investigated in experiments  <dig> and  <dig> and additionally in an experiment that addressed the production of biomass and cellular energy during aerobic and anaerobic cultivation . ammonium was either net consumed or net produced, which depended on the availability of both o <dig> and
no3− ). in the absence of
no3−,nh4+ was invariably consumed, irrespective of o <dig> availability . in the presence of
no3−,
nh4+ was either consumed or produced under oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively . taken together, these results suggest a role of
no3− in nitrogen assimilation under oxic conditions when
nh4+ is depleted, and a role of no3- in dissimilation under anoxic conditions when
nh4+is available. additionally, the net production of nh4+ under anoxic conditions suggests dissimilatory
no3−reduction to
nh4+ by an- <dig> 

products of anaerobic nitrate turnover
the precursors, intermediates, and end products of dissimilatory no3- reduction  by an- <dig> were investigated in a 15n-labeling experiment . axenic mycelia were incubated with 15no3- and then subjected to a sudden oxic-anoxic shift. the anaerobic consumption of no3- by an- <dig> was accompanied by the production and cellular release of nh4+, no2-, and n2o, but not n <dig> . ammonium was quantitatively by far the most important product, whereas n2o and no2- were less important . biomass-specific 15nh4+ production rates equaled 15no3- consumption rates during the first 3 days of incubation . during the remaining incubation time, n consumption and production rates were generally lower than during the first 3 days . after no further decrease of the no3- concentration was observed , nh4+, n2o, and no2- formed  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively, of all n produced and released into the liquid media. these results substantiate the capability of an- <dig> to dissimilatorily reduce no3- to nh4+ , no2- and n2o  under anoxic conditions.

rates were calculated for linear increases or decreases in the amount of the different nitrogen species during the early and late phase of anaerobic incubation. mean rates  are given as nmol n g- <dig> protein h- <dig>  positive and negative values indicate production and consumption, respectively.

intracellular nitrate storage
the capability of an- <dig> to store nitrate intracellularly, a common trait of large-celled microorganisms that respire nitrate, was investigated during both aerobic and anaerobic cultivation . intracellular no3- concentrations  were high when extracellular no3- concentrations  were high and vice versa, irrespective of o <dig> availability . under oxic conditions, however, icno <dig> and ecno <dig> concentrations dropped sharply within the first day of incubation , whereas under anoxic conditions, steady decreases in icno <dig> and ecno <dig> concentrations were noted during 11 days of incubation .

in the 15n-labeling experiment , the total amount of n produced in each incubation vial  exceeded the total amount of no3- consumed , implying that also  <dig>  nmol icno <dig> was consumed during the anoxic incubation. the initial amount of icno <dig> transferred into the incubation vials together with the an- <dig> mycelia of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol equaled the calculated amount of icno <dig> needed to close the n budget.

production of biomass and cellular energy
the production of biomass and cellular energy by an- <dig> was studied during aerobic and anaerobic cultivation in the presence or absence of no3- ; biomass production was also recorded in experiment  <dig>  for this purpose, the time courses of protein and atp contents of an- <dig> mycelia and of no3- and nh4+ concentrations in the liquid media were followed. biomass production by an- <dig> was significantly higher when o <dig> and/or no3- were available in the liquid media . the biomass-specific atp contents of an- <dig> reached higher values when no3- was available in the liquid media and were invariably low in its absence . under oxic conditions, atp contents increased to maximum values within 1 day of incubation and steadily decreased during the following 8 days . under anoxic conditions, atp contents reached maximum values only after 3 days and thereafter fluctuated around intermediate values . these results substantiate the capability of an- <dig> to grow anaerobically and produce cellular energy by dissimilatory no3- reduction to nh4+.

nitrate concentrations are given as the mean  of 6– <dig> samples taken during the cultivation period. final biomass is given as the mean  wet weight of three fungal cultures harvested at the end of the cultivation period. the final biomass does not include the  weight of six samples that were taken for protein and atp analysis in experiment  <dig> 

discussion
physiology of isolate an-4
all observations made during incubations of aspergillus terreus  in the presence and absence of o <dig> and no3- indicate that this fungus is capable of dissimilatory no3- reduction to nh4+ <cit> . an- <dig> produced nh4+ only under anoxic conditions and through no3- reduction as proven in the 15n-labeling experiment. the process led to significant cellular atp production and biomass growth and also occurred when nh4+ was added to suppress no3- assimilation, stressing the dissimilatory nature of the observed anaerobic no3- reduction activity. for a large number of other fungal species, this type of anaerobic no3- metabolism has been termed “ammonia fermentation” in case that the reduction of no3- to nh4+ was coupled to the oxidation of organic carbon compounds to acetate and substrate-level phosphorylation
 <cit> . ammonia fermentation has been found in a wide spectrum of filamentous ascomycetous fungi
 <cit> , but so far not in fungi isolated from marine environments. since the fermentation of organic substrates is not proven for an- <dig>  the anaerobic no3- metabolism of this isolate might as well be of respiratory nature and then corresponds to dnra. this pathway has so far been excluded to occur in fungi because a pentaheme cytochrome c no2- reductase typical of dnra
 <cit>  has not been found in fungi with an anaerobic no3- metabolism
 <cit> .

aside from the general accord with fungal ammonia fermentation or dnra, the anaerobic no3- metabolism of an- <dig> showed several interesting features. most notably, dissimilatory no3- reduction was accompanied by significant n2o production  and to a lesser extent by no2- production . while it was not surprising that traces of no2-, an intermediate of dissimilatory no3- reduction to nh4+, were released into the liquid media
 <cit> , the production and cellular release of n2o was unexpected
 <cit> . nitrous oxide is the end product of incomplete denitrification in many plant-pathogenic and soil fungi
 <cit> , whereas the marine isolate an- <dig> obviously produces n2o via dissimilatory no3- reduction to nh4+. nitrous oxide is not generally known as an intermediate of dissimilatory no3- reduction to nh4+, but may well be a by-product of this reduction pathway as shown for bacteria
 <cit> .

an- <dig> is clearly able to store no3- intracellularly and use it for dissimilatory no3- reduction to nh4+. intracellular no3- storage is known for a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms capable of dissimilatory no3- reduction, but so far has not been reported for fungi, even when capable of denitrification or ammonia fermentation
 <cit> . large sulfide-oxidizing bacteria
 <cit> , foraminifers and gromiids
 <cit> , and diatoms
 <cit>  store no3- in their cells in millimolar concentrations. in our experiments with an- <dig>  the maximum biomass-specific intracellular no3- contents were 6–8 μmol g- <dig> protein. assuming a cellular protein content of 50% of the dry weight and a cellular water content of 90% of the wet weight, maximum intracellular nitrate concentrations reached ca. 400 μmol l- <dig>  this intracellular no3- pool proved to be quantitatively important for dissimilatory no3- reduction by an- <dig>  since it contributed up to 38% to the total no3- consumption in the 15n-labeling experiment. the initially high rates of nh4+ production may suggest that an- <dig> is first using up the readily available intracellular no3- stores before it switches to using extracellular no3- as well, but this scenario needs to be proven in a dedicated 15n-labeling experiment. the general physiology of intracellular no3- storage by an- <dig> is currently unknown. for instance, it is not clear at which growth stage and under which ambient conditions an- <dig> is taking up no3- from the environment because the phase of increasing intracellular no3- contents was not captured by our oxic and anoxic incubations. from the observed correlation between icno <dig> and ecno <dig> it can be concluded that an unknown enrichment factor cannot be exceeded, meaning that icno <dig> concentrations will increase with ecno <dig> concentrations, probably up to an as yet unknown maximum icno <dig> concentration. benthic microorganisms that store no3- often show vertical migration behavior in the sediment that may enable them to take up no3- closer to the sediment surface and in the presence of o <dig> <cit> . it is conceivable that the hyphae of an- <dig> grow in direction of no3--containing layers closer to the sediment surface to facilitate no3- uptake. finally, it remains to be investigated whether an- <dig> accumulates no3- in acidic vacuoles as recently shown for large sulfur bacteria
 <cit>  or in the cytosol of the hyphae.

ecological implications of anaerobic nitrate turnover by isolate an-4
aspergillus terreus is a common and globally occurring soil fungus that is also known from substrates as diverse as air, salterns, capybara droppings, lung of pocket mice, corn, cotton plants, milled rice, muesli, and wall paint
 <cit> . the species has been reported from marine and associated habitats, such as mangroves and soft corals, and isolates from these habitats have been widely investigated for the production of bioactive compounds
 <cit> . a. terreus has also been isolated from the hypersaline water of the dead sea
 <cit> . the species is an important human pathogen causing bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and disseminated infections
 <cit> . dissimilatory no3- reduction by human-associated microorganisms has been demonstrated
 <cit> , but it is not known whether fungi are involved. a. terreus is also of considerable biotechnological interest because it produces a wide diversity of secondary metabolites that find pharmaceutical applications, biotechnologically relevant compounds such as itaconic acid and itatartaric acid, as well as mycotoxins that are important for food safety .

the wide habitat spectrum of a. terreus might be significantly expanded by the ability for dissimilatory no3- reduction in the absence of o <dig>  this fungus has the potential to survive hypoxic or anoxic conditions that prevail in aquatic sediments mostly just a few millimeters below the surface
 <cit>  or even directly at the surface when o <dig> concentrations are low in the water column
 <cit> . in contrast, no3- originating from the water column and/or the nitrification layer at the sediment surface diffuses deeper into the sediment than o <dig> does
 <cit> . in shallow sediments, no3--rich water is introduced into even deeper layers by mixing forces such as bioturbation, bioirrigation, and ripple movement
 <cit> . the sediment habitat in which a. terreus can thrive is further expanded by its no3- storage capability. the maximum intracellular no3- content of 8 μmol g- <dig> protein theoretically sustains dissimilatory no3- reduction without extracellular no3- supply for 2– <dig>  days . survival and growth beyond this time frame will depend on the ability of a. terreus to repeatedly access no3- in its natural sediment habitat, which is currently unknown.

the dissimilatory no3- reduction activity of an- <dig> leads to the production and release of nh4+, n2o, and no2-. thus, unlike the denitrification and anammox activities of other microorganisms, the anaerobic no3- metabolism of an- <dig> cannot directly lead to fixed nitrogen removal. since the major product of no3- reduction is nh4+, an- <dig> merely converts one form of fixed nitrogen into another one. it is noteworthy, however, that the production of nh4+ and no2- by an- <dig> might indirectly contribute to fixed nitrogen removal by fueling anammox, the dominant nitrogen loss process in many omzs
 <cit> . remarkably, an- <dig> produces and releases ca. 15% of the total no3- reduced as n2o, a potent greenhouse gas
 <cit> . interestingly, the omzs of the arabian sea have repeatedly been reported to be major sites of n2o production, especially in continental shelf areas and coastal upwelling zones
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
before meaningful conclusions on the potential impact of fungi on the marine nitrogen cycle can be drawn, it has to be established how abundant and widespread fungi with an anaerobic no3- metabolism are in marine environments. previous studies reported a high diversity of fungi in o2-deficient marine environments
 <cit> , a large proportion of which may have similar physiologies as an- <dig>  therefore, further concerted efforts should aim at revealing the so far largely ignored influence of fungi on the marine nitrogen cycle and their role in the production of greenhouse gases.
