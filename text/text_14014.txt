BACKGROUND
dna damage is thought to be induced not only by exogenous genotoxic stresses such as uv and ionizing radiation but also by intrinsic endogeneous stresses such as dna replication errors and the oxidative stress associated with cell metabolism. unlike animals, plants cannot escape from exogenous genotoxic stresses. furthermore, in plants, dna replication sites are restricted mainly to meristematic tissues, and differentiation of the germ line is not predetermined; plants thus need an efficient and flexible genome maintenance system. however, very little is known about the mechanism maintaining genome stability in response to dna replication stresses.

recq helicases are members of the atp-dependent helicase family and play important roles in maintaining genome stability in eukaryotic cells during dna repair
 <cit> , dna replication
 <cit> , telomere maintenance
 <cit> , and homologous recombination  processes
 <cit> . yeast has a single recq gene, sgs <dig>  but mammals and plants have multiple recq genes, humans having five and arabidopsis seven
 <cit> . interestingly, overlapping and distinct roles of recq proteins have been reported in humans
 <cit> . for example, defects in blm, wrn and hsrecq <dig> are found in bloom’s, werner, and rothmund-thomson syndromes, respectively
 <cit> . patients with these syndromes exhibit genomic instability and are predisposed to cancer, and their cells are hypersensitive to dna-damaging agents. during dna replication and maintenance of the telomere, the role of blm overlaps with that of wrn. however, blm promotes exonuclease 1-mediated dna resection during the initial step of dsb repair, whereas other recq helicases do not promote this step
 <cit> . strikingly, patients with the blm defect show enhanced sister chromatid exchange  frequencies
 <cit> , indicating that blm suppresses hr in the course of dna replication. moreover, blm interacts with replication protein a  and topoisomerase iii
 <cit> . it has been revealed recently that blm plays a role in recovery from dna replication arrest
 <cit> . therefore, blm is likely to be a multi-functional protein involved in several aspects of genome maintenance in mammals. many studies to date have focused on dna replication maintenance, given the known association between hr and dna replication
 <cit> .

two blm homologs, atrecq4a and atrecq4b, have been isolated in arabidopsis and their functions analyzed using mutant plants
 <cit> . atrecq4a mutants showed enhanced frequency of hr during normal growth condition and hypersensitivity to dna damaging agents compared to wild-type  plants. in contrast, atrecq4b mutants had a reduced frequency of hr and did not show sensitivity to dna-damaging agents compared to wt plants despite the high degree of identity of the two recq4s
 <cit> . recently, it was reported that atrecq4a is required for efficient synthesis-dependent strand annealing  but has only a limited role in single-strand annealing 
 <cit> . our previous study of osrecql <dig> showed that over-expression of osrecql <dig> promoted the resection process of hr-mediated dsb repair in rice
 <cit> . however, the functions of blm-related proteins in plants have not been well analyzed, particularly in the context of their potential "caretaker" role during dna replication in plant meristems.

the presence of seven recq-like genes has been reported in rice—a monocotyledonous model plant. however, these seven genes in rice do not correspond to the seven arabidopsis genes. interestingly, a single blm counterpart gene, osrecql <dig>  has been predicted in the rice genome
 <cit> . although the presence of two blm-like genes with different functions in arabidopsis is interesting from the perspective of the evolution of genome stability in plants, the presence of a single blm counterpart gene in rice seems to favor the functional analysis of blm counterpart genes. several previous reports in arabidopsis had shown the effect of blm ortholog genes on hr; we asked whether this function could have some relationship to the maintenance of genome stability during dna replication.

in addition to having an advantage for the analysis of blm counterpart genes in plants as mentioned above, rice is an ideal model plant in which to evaluate the functions of genes involved in genome stability at sites of dna replication, i.e., the meristem. furthermore, s-phase is concentrated in the region of rice root meristems
 <cit> . this is because, in rice, the genotoxic stresses that accompany the arrest of dna replication never induce endoreduplication
 <cit> , which is one of the routes of escape from dna damage used in arabidopsis <cit> .

here, we report the cloning of osrecql <dig> from rice and characterize the phenotypes of knockout plants in terms of dna stability at the site of dna replication. our findings indicate that osrecql <dig> plays an important role in maintaining genome stability, at least in the root apical meristem , via suppression of hr.

RESULTS
isolation of osrecql <dig> cdna from rice
the presence of an atrecq4a like sequence in the rice genome was reported by hartung and puchta
 <cit> , who identified the 1164-amino acids protein cae <dig>  as osrecq4a. we cloned the corresponding full-length cdna by rt-pcr and race using specific primers designed according to the genomic sequence os04g <dig> containing the cae <dig> coding sequence. our cdna sequence encodes  <dig> amino acids and is the same as the loc_os04g <dig>  sequence predicted in the gramene database . we named our sequence osrecql <dig> for oryza sativa recq like protein  <dig> 

osrecql <dig> consists of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, and encodes a protein with  <dig> amino acids including the dexdc  and helics  helicase domains, as well as an rqc  and an hrdc  domain
 <cit>  . the result is the same as the prediction by the rice genome annotation project . because the dexdc domain is conserved in blm and atrecq4a, the osrecq4a  predicted by hartung and puchta lacking the dexdc domain seems to be non-functional .

arabidopsis atrecq4a and atrecq4b are reported to be paralogous proteins with different functions. since the amino acids sequences of atrecq4a and osrecql <dig> are quite similar to each other, and differ slightly from that of atrecq4b protein, we hypothesized that atrecq4b protein has acquired or lost specific motifs required for different functions. we compared several motifs of osrecql <dig>  atrecq4a and atrecq4b proteins using the salad database  and found that, near the c-terminus of the helicase domain, a cmkmgync sequence was detected only in atrecq4b; and in the n-terminus of the helicase domain, a dkesqksqflsstatri sequence is conserved between osrecql <dig> and atrecq4a but not in atrecq4b . further investigations of these motifs are required. it might be also interesting to try to express either atrecq4a or atrecq4b protein in the osrecql <dig> mutant background.

phylogenetic analysis revealed the isolated osrecql <dig> to be most similar to atrecq4a  and atrecq4b  at the amino acid level . the amino acid sequence encoded by the region spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> of osrecql <dig> had especially high identity to that encoded by the region spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> of atrecq4a . as expected, osrecql <dig> more closely resembled atrecq4a than atrecq4b as determined by blastz alignment analysis
 <cit>  .

expression of osrecql <dig> in meristems
expression of osrecql <dig> was analyzed by northern blot in 7-day-old seedlings of the japonica-type rice cultivars dongjin or nipponbare. using probe a , relatively strong signals were observed in the basal parts of shoots  including the shoot apical meristem , and weak signals were observed in the root . no signal was detected in the lower  or upper  shoot .

in addition, sam- and ram-specific expression of osrecql <dig> was confirmed by in situ hybridization . interestingly, meristem-specific expression of other recq family genes in rice was reported by saotome et al.
 <cit> , who analyzed four other recq members—osrecq <dig>  osrecq <dig>  osrecqsim and osrecq886—in rice. our result was further supported by a database analysis of ricexpro —a repository of gene expression profiles derived from microarray analysis of tissues or organs encompassing all growth stages of rice plants
 <cit> . osrecql <dig> was highly expressed in the ram . these results suggested that expression of osrecql <dig> was restricted to meristematic tissues.

to elucidate the biological role of osrecql <dig>  we characterized t-dna and tos <dig> retrotransposon inserted lines of osrecql <dig>  namely osrecql4- <dig>  of dongjin background and osrecql4- <dig>  of nipponbare background, respectively. the sequences of the insertion sites were determined by pcr and subsequent sequencing. two t-dnas linked in a head-to-head manner were inserted into exon  <dig> with a genomic deletion of 65 bp. the tos <dig> line was inserted at exon  <dig> accompanied by 5 bp overlap .

expression of osrecql <dig> in osrecql4- <dig> and osrecql4- <dig> mutants was evaluated by northern blot analysis. in this experiment, total rnas from bs in 7-day-old wt and osrecql <dig> mutants were analyzed. probe a was located near the n-terminus and probe b was located near the c-terminus and included part of the rqc domain . a transcript of ca.  <dig>  kb was detected by probe a and b in wt plants, but not in osrecql4- <dig> or osrecql4- <dig> . under normal conditions, growth of osrecql4- <dig> and osrecql4- <dig> plants was comparable to that of wt plants. furthermore, these mutant plants were fertile, as also reported for arabidopsis atrecq4a mutants
 <cit> .

osrecql <dig> is involved in dsb repair and recovery from s-phase arrest
to assess sensitivity to dna damage, seeds from osrecql <dig> mutants and their wt counterparts were treated with bleomycin at concentrations between  <dig> and 20 mg/l. five days after germination, total root length was measured. when osrecql4- <dig> or osrecql4- <dig> mutants were treated with 5 mg/l bleomycin, root length was shorter than that of wt plants, suggesting that osrecql <dig> might be involved in the repair of dna single-strand breaks  and/or dsbs . similarly, we assessed the involvement of osrecql <dig> in the recovery process from s-phase arrest caused by inhibition of dna polymerase. dna replication can be arrested by aphidicolin—an inhibitor of dna polymerase α
 <cit> . decreased root growth was observed upon treatment with 5 mg/l aphidicolin . a similar result was obtained upon treatment with  <dig>  mm hydroxyurea . the expression of osrecql <dig> in roots increased in response to aphidicolin but not bleomycin .

judging from the result of northern blot analysis, both osrecql4- <dig>  and osrecql4- <dig>  mutants have non-functional protein if expressed since osrecql <dig> transcripts were not detected with probe b. furthermore, both mutants showed hyper-sensitivity against bleomycin and aphidicolin . in addition, we detected increased cell death upon aphidicolin treatment not only in osrecql4- <dig>  but also in osrecql4- <dig>  in our previous manuscript.

since osrecql4- <dig> mutant has a gus expression cassette in its t-dna region, we could not evaluate homologous recombination frequency using the gu-us recombination substrate system. therefore, we used mainly the osrecql4- <dig> mutant line for our experiments.

failure to recover from dna replication arrest induces dsbs
in humans, blm is involved in the recovery process from dna replication arrest that can be induced by ssbs or dna adducts by the unwinding of arrested replication forks. in addition, the increased sce observed in blm mutant cells is explained by enhanced dsbs due to a lack of the helicase activity of blm
 <cit> . we therefore investigated whether the increased sensitivity of osrecql <dig> mutants to aphidicolin treatment was due to a defect of the recovery from dna replication arrest in osrecql <dig> cells as like blm mutant cells and a detected increased dsbs in osrecql <dig> plants.

we used a comet assay to investigate induction of dsbs following aphidicolin treatment. six-week-old scutellum-derived calli from nipponbare  and osrecql4- <dig> were treated with 5 mg/l aphidicolin for 60 min; the cells were then observed over time after removal of the aphidicolin. the comet tail of osrecql4- <dig> did not differ from that of control nb without aphidicolin treatment. following aphidicolin treatment, comet tails indicating dsbs were seen in osrecql4- <dig> cells immediately after aphidicolin removal, and remained at 15 min after removal of aphidicolin. in contrast, no comet tails were detected in control nb cells, even after aphidicolin treatment . these results suggest that, in the absence of osrecql <dig>  aphidicolin-triggered dna replication arrest resulted in dsb induction. although these dsbs might be finally repaired by intrinsic dna repair systems including hr, cell cycle progression will be delayed by the time needed for dsb repair.

next, we used tunel  to observe the occurrence of dna damage in root tips of the osrecql4- <dig> mutant after aphidicolin treatment. this assay detects dsbs, ssbs, and nicks in tissues by labeling the 3-terminal ends of nucleic acids
 <cit> . a dna damage signal was observed in the meristem and in epidermal cells . the former signal is related to cell division but the latter seems to be induced by physical stress during root growth. tunel signals induced by physical stress have been observed in root caps and root hairs
 <cit> . dna damage signals were observed in the root meristem of osrecql4- <dig> plants but not in wt plants after treatment with 40 mg/l aphidicolin . these results indicate that enhanced dna replication arrest induced dna damage in the ram of the osrecql4- <dig> mutant.

accumulated dsbs triggered by dna replication arrest induce hr
induced dsbs can be repaired by intrinsic dna repair systems; if they are not repaired properly, cell death might be induced. because hr is a dsb repair system used during s-phase of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are available as templates for dna repair, we analyzed whether the induced dsbs observed in osrecql <dig> mutants could enhance hr.

we used the gus recombination reporter pgu.c.us
 <cit>  to monitor the osrecql <dig> mutant for frequency of hr . recombination events between two overlapping gus sequences can produce a functional gus gene resulting in blue spots in the cells that can be detected by gus histochemical staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide. pgu.c.us was transformed into a heterozygous osrecql4- <dig> line; a transgenic line with a single copy of the recombination reporter was identified by southern blot analysis  and used for further studies. the frequency of hr events was monitored in the t <dig> generation of pgu.c.us transgenic rice plants, which were homozygous for either the osrecql <dig> mutation allele or the wt osrecql <dig> allele. we evaluated the frequency of hr events in scutellum-derived calli.

the distribution of hr frequency by callus weight indicated that hr frequency was greater in the osrecql4- <dig> mutant than in wt . hr frequency did not change in wt but increased further in the osrecql4- <dig> mutant upon aphidicolin treatment .

un-repaired dna replication arrest induces cell death
the increased sensitivity to aphidicolin observed in osrecql <dig> mutants implied that the increased number of dsbs detected in these mutants could induce delayed cell cycle progression or that dsbs might not have been repaired sufficiently by hr.

we revealed cell death by the uptake of pi, which permeates the cell membranes of dying and dead cells
 <cit> . pi-stained root tips were detected after aphidicolin  treatment for 24 h. we observed root tips using the z-stack function . upon aphidicolin treatment, we detected a significantly increased number of pi staining signals in osrecql4- <dig> mutants  than in wt nb  . similarly, we observed increased pi staining signals in osrecql4- <dig> mutants  than wt dongjin  . the optimum concentration of aphidicolin for the visualization of dead pi-stained cells differed with ecotype. we also used pi staining to see if other types of inducers of dna damage affected induction of cell death; however, no other inducers led to significant differences between wt and osrecql <dig> . nevertheless, high concentrations or prolonged treatment induced abnormal shapes in the roots and turned them opaque . this result suggested that osrecql <dig> mutant plants failed to recover from dna replication arrest, resulting in an increased numbers of dsbs, leading to induction of cell death in the root meristem.

discussion
here, we assayed the function of the blm homolog osrecql <dig> during dna replication in rice via knockout mutants. using the comet assay, we demonstrated induction of dsbs in aphidicolin-treated osrecql <dig> mutant cells. tunel analysis suggested that dna damage including dsbs was induced at the ram. the hr assay using the gus recombination reporter showed that at least a fraction of the dsbs could be repaired by hr, explaining why hr is enhanced in osrecql <dig> mutants. the pi staining assay showed that un-repaired dsbs induced cell death at the root meristem. the combined results of comet, tunel and hr assays as well as pi staining using mutant plants under a combination of aphidicolin treatments clearly demonstrated the important role of osrecql <dig> in the process of recovery from dna replication arrest, and also the conserved role of blm orthologous proteins in this process. in this study, we focused on the role of osrecql <dig> in genomic maintenance during dna replication in the ram. however, osrecql <dig> is also expressed in the sam . thus, we consider osrecql <dig> to be involved in the maintenance of genome stability during dna replication at the sam as well as the ram. therefore, increased mutations could accumulate in osrecql <dig> mutant plants during the mitotic cell cycle, and these mutations should be inherited by subsequent generations.

the osrecql4- <dig>  has only a small amount of truncated protein and osrecql4- <dig>  has a longer protein according to northern blot analysis . thus, we concluded that both the osrecql4- <dig> and the osrecql4- <dig> mutants produce an aberrant size of osrecql <dig> protein defective in the consensus domain rqc if expressed. the two mutants might have different effects. however, we revealed both mutants have hyper-sensitivity to dna damage agents and increase cell death upon aphidicolin treatment.

in this study, we have shown that dna replication arrest leads to a hyper-recombination phenotype in plants. urawa et al.
 <cit>  reported that the non-transcribed spacer  between ribosomal rna genes , which contains a replication fork barrier of rdna
 <cit> , enhances hr in arabidopsis. in escherichia coli, it has been hypothesized that a damaged dna replication fork might be restarted by holliday junction formation, leading to dna cleavage by holliday junction dissolution and finally to repair by hr. however, this mechanism runs the risk of inappropriate recombination. thus, a stalled fork  might be processed by dna helicases to avoid replication errors
 <cit> .

recently, schuermann et al.
 <cit>  reported that a defect in dna polymerase delta  <dig>  in arabidopsis exhibited elevated hr frequency at stalled and collapsed replication forks. this report also supported our conclusion that dna replication stress induces hr in plants. however, the molecular mechanism connecting dna replication stress and enhanced hr remains obscure in plants. here, we see a relationship between accumulated dsbs, hr and cell death accompanying dna replication arrest at the site of the meristem.

rad51-dependent repair hr includes break-induced replication , double-holliday junction , and sdsa. rad51-independent ssa also repairs dsb
 <cit> . it was been reported recently that, with a direct repeat gu-us recombination reporter, a functional gus gene can be generated mainly by the ssa pathway, with sdsa playing only a minor role following dsb
 <cit> . however, during replication, induced dsbs do not induce two free ends, but rather a one-ended dsb, i.e., a dna double-strand end . the dse invades its sister chromatid to be repaired, with dna synthesis by bir
 <cit> . thus, although increased hr efficiency was demonstrated here using the direct repeat gu-us recombination reporter to associate osrecql <dig> and hr, the hr detected should be rad51-dependent hr repair. in future, this could be confirmed using a double mutant with rad <dig>  further points in support of the hypothesis of alternative repair of the gu-us reporter are the differences in tissues  and induction , which might lead to different prevalence of cell-cycle states in which the repair takes place.

we analyzed the sensitivity of osrecql <dig> mutants to aphidicolin and bleomycin. since defects in osrecql <dig> enhance the sensitivity of rice to both these latter compounds, osrecql <dig> might be involved in recovery from dna replication arrest and dsb repair. on the other hand, osrecql <dig> mutants showed normal growth and were fertile, although osrecql <dig> mutants showed aberrantly sized osrecql <dig> protein, indicating that osrecql <dig> might not be essential. in this respect, it has been reported that members of recq family genes in rice—osrecq <dig>  osrecq <dig>  osrecqsim and osrecq886—are expressed in meristems
 <cit> , suggesting that recq helicase family members might play overlapping roles in maintaining genome stability in proliferative cells. however, homozygous blm mice exhibit growth retardation
 <cit> . it might be interesting to evaluate growth of the osrecql <dig> mutant under conditions of elevated uv, since dna replication arrest is induced by uv photoproducts.

although the sensitivity of arabidopsis atrecq4a mutants to bleomycin treatment was the same as that of wt plants, in our study we observed enhanced bleomycin sensitivity in rice osrecql <dig> mutants compared to wt plants. this might be due to differences in the system, tissue and experimental procedure. furthermore, we observed cell death in the root meristem of osrecql <dig> mutant plants. these differences might be attributed to the occurrence of endoreduplication in arabidopsis, since cells undergoing dna damage can enter into endocycle and be separated from the mitotic cell cycle in arabidopsis.

our results indicate that osrecql <dig> is expressed at sam and ram, i.e., sites of cell division. furthermore, expression of osrecql <dig> was induced by aphidicolin treatment but not by bleomycin . these results suggest that, according to their level of transcription, osrecql <dig> plays a more important role in repair during dna replication than in dsbs repair. blm assembles at stalled replication forks
 <cit> , which supports the notion of dna replication arrest inducible expression of osrecql <dig> . these results suggest that osrecql <dig> is required for recovery from dna replication arrest. the osrecql4- <dig> mutant failed to recover from dna replication arrest; this resulted in an increased number of dsbs requiring repair, possibly by hr.

interestingly, we found that, without aphidicolin treatment, both wt and osrecql4- <dig> mutants produced a very low level of dsbs  judging from the comet assay. similarly, dna damage in osrecql4- <dig> at the cell division root zone analyzed by tunel was almost comparable to that of wt plants. however, the osrecql4- <dig> mutant showed a greater frequency of hr than did wt plants under normal growth conditions without aphidicolin treatment. this suggested that dsbs induced in the osrecql4- <dig> mutant could be repaired by dna repair systems, including hr, under normal growth conditions, since hr can proceed slowly without recq helicase
 <cit> . however, excess dsbs induced by aphidicolin treatment could not be repaired by intrinsic dna repair systems, and un-repaired dsbs were thus detected by comet and tunel assay. furthermore, un-repaired dsbs might induce cell death in osrecql <dig> mutants upon aphidicolin treatment. thus, osrecql <dig> might be required to rescue plants from genotoxic stress.

broadly speaking, recq helicases maintain dna stability. the recq helicase blm promotes not only recovery from dna replication arrest, but also exonuclease 1-mediated dna resection during the initial step of dsb repair
 <cit> . osrecql <dig> also plays a role in promoting processing of hr-mediated dsb repair in rice
 <cit> . osrecql <dig> was expressed exclusively in meristems; also, other rice recq-like genes were expressed in meristematic tissues
 <cit> . thus, we anticipate overlapping and distinct roles for the seven recq helicase genes in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported here indicate that osrecql <dig> has an important function in maintaining genome stability in rice during dna replication. since blm and sgs <dig> exert their function of recovering arrested replication forks by their helicase activity, osrecql <dig> might have the same activity in genome maintenance in rice. in particular, enhanced dsbs and cell death were observed upon dna replication arrest in the cell division zone of osrecql <dig> mutants. from this, we conclude that osrecql <dig> is required for recovery from dna replication arrest in the rice meristem. recq helicases should have partially overlapping roles in maintaining genome stability, and among them might be specialists whose primary role is genome stability.
