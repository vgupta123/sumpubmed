BACKGROUND
estrogen plays important roles both in reproductive physiology and in numerous human disease states  <cit> . estrogen exerts its biological actions by binding to two structurally and functionally distinct estrogen receptors , α and β  <cit> . erα is the major er in human mammary epithelium. after binding with estrogen, it undergoes an activating conformational change that promotes its homodimerization and nuclear transportation. in the nucleus, the dimer is able to bind, with high affinity, to cis-acting enhancers known as estrogen response elements , which lie within the regulatory regions of target genes. the classical ere, originally discovered in the xenopus vitellogenin gene, consists of a 13-nucleotide inverted palindromic sequence separated by any three nucleotides   <cit> .

through its mitogenic effect, estrogen is thought to play a role in breast cancer development  <cit> . as many as 70% of patients with breast cancer are estrogen-receptor positive  <cit> . ers may play different pathophysiological roles at different stages of tumor progression, and may also be responsible for the increased incidence of breast cancer following hormone replacement therapy  <cit> . although several pathways have been reported, the e2-er-ere pathway is believed to be responsible for the mitogenic effect of estradiol and to play a crucial role in regulating its oncogenic expression  <cit> .

erα activity can be regulated by a multitude of coregulatory factors, termed coactivators and corepressors  <cit> . although the biological role of estrogen-mediated activation of genes is well established, the significance of repression has only recently begun to be appreciated. erα repressors are proposed to provide a counterbalance to estrogen-induced transactivation, and represent a mechanism that may be employed by the cell for tumor suppression  <cit> .

the breast cancer and ovarian susceptibility gene  <dig>  has been shown to inhibit erα signaling by repressing the af- <dig> domain of erα, which is linked to the ligand-binding domain. brca <dig> inhibits the estrogen-stimulated expression of ps <dig>  cathepsin d, and a variety of other estrogen-responsive genes in this way  <cit> . the finding that brca <dig> is a corepressor of erα provides a potential molecular explanation for the tissue-specific nature of brca1-associated cancer. however, cancer-causing mutations of brca <dig> only account for 5–10% of breast cancer. therefore, it is conceivable that additional factors having a similar corepressor activity may participate in the same regulatory process, and that defects in these may contribute to the etiology of some forms of breast cancer. thus, our efforts have been devoted to identifying novel human genes, which, like brca <dig>  repress erα activity.

genetic screen in various model organisms is one means to identify useful genes from the flood of sequence information from the various genome projects  <cit> . recent advances in cell-based, genetic, high-throughput screening provide an efficient approach to explore gene function and disease relevance  <cit> . these strategies offer the advantages of speed, cost-effectiveness, genome coverage, and immediate biological relevance  <cit> . in an effort to identify human genes involved in regulating activity of erα, we constructed a high-throughput, cell-based functional screening platform by linking a response element  with a reporter gene. this has enabled us to make a quantitative assessment of the effect of candidate genes on the cellular activity of erα, in the presence or absence of its cognate ligand e <dig>  we describe here the identification and characterization of znf <dig>  a novel repressor of erα mediated transactivation. in addition, the mrna and protein levels of ps2/tff <dig>  an estrogen responsive gene, were downregulated by znf <dig> 

methods
plasmids
we constructed a cdna library from the human refseq database . we selected candidate sequences with "hypothetical", "predicted", "putative", or "unknown" in their definition, or candidates with fewer than three functional research articles. the full-length cdna of these candidate genes was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcdna <dig> /myc-his  b    <cit> . this cdna library, containing  <dig> genes, was then screened. the reporter plasmid pgl4-ere-luc was obtained by inserting the following two annealed oligonucleotides between the xho i-hind iii sites of the multiple cloning site of the luciferase reporter vector pgl4-basic : 5' tcg aga ggt cac agt gac cta ggt cac agt gac cta gat ctg ggc ata taa tgga-3' and 5'-agc ttc cat tat ata ccc aga tct agg tca ctg tga cct agg tca ctg tga cctc-3'. this sequence contains two tandem repeats of the consensus ere oligonucleotide sequence  upstream of the minimal human e1b tata promoter sequence   <cit> . expression vector herα was generously provided by dr. ann m. nardulli, university of illinois, usa. dr. richard baer, columbia university medical center, usa, kindly provided the brca <dig> expression plasmid. the prl-tk plasmid, which contains the renilla luciferase gene, was used as an internal control and was purchased from promega .

cell culture, transient transfection and dual-luciferase reporter assay
hela cells were maintained in dmem  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. mcf- <dig> cells  were maintained in dmem containing 10% fetal bovine serum and  <dig> μg/ml insulin . all cells were incubated in a 5% co <dig> incubator at 37°c. depletion of hormone ligands for steroid receptor activation studies was achieved by cell culture in estrogen-depleted media .

for reporter gene assays, hela cells were seeded on 96-well plates in dmem lacking phenol red and supplemented with 5% charcoal/dextran-treated fbs. after  <dig> h, the cells were transfected using the vigorous transfection reagent . a total of  <dig>  ng plasmid dna per well were used, comprising  <dig> ng pgl4-ere-luc,  <dig> ng prl-tk,  <dig>  ng erα and  <dig> ng of the candidate gene.  <dig> h later, the transfected cells were treated with  <dig> nm 17β-estradiol  or  <dig> % vehicle  for  <dig> h. each experiment of non-stimulation and stimulation was performed in triplicate wells. firefly luciferase activity was detected with the dual-glo luciferase assay kit , using a genios pro reader , and corrected for transfection efficiency against renilla luciferase activity.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
the labeled probe was prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides  containing the xenopus vitellogenin a <dig> ere gene, filling in the 3' overhang in the presence of biotin  <cit> . hela cells were estrogen-depleted for  <dig> days, then transfected with erα and pcdb or the znf <dig> expression construct  using a btx ecm  <dig> square wave electroporator  .  <dig> h later, cells were treated with  <dig> nm or  <dig> nm e <dig> for  <dig> h to increase nuclear localization of the erα. the nuclear protein extracts were prepared with the ne-per nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents . protein-dna binding was measured, briefly, as follows, using the lightshift™ chemiluminescent emsa kit : equal amounts  of nuclear extract protein were used in each reaction, extracts were preincubated with a binding buffer containing 50% glycerol,  <dig> ng/μl polydi-dc, 1% np <dig> and biotin end-labeled probe at 4°c for  <dig> min, then at room temperature for  <dig> min, in a total volume of  <dig> μl. a 200-fold excess of non-labeled ere probe was added in some of the experiments. the samples were loaded onto prerun 5% polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions. after electrophoresis, gel was transferred to biodyne nylon membrane . subsequent steps were performed as instructed by the manufacturer .

western blot analysis
cell culture and transfection conditions were identical to those described above for emsa analysis. after transfection with erα and the indicated plasmids for  <dig> h, the cells were incubated with  <dig> nm e <dig> or vehicle for  <dig> h, then lysed with ripa buffer  for  <dig> min on ice. the supernatant protein concentration was measured using a bca protein assay kit .  <dig> μg total protein was separated by sds-page . the antibodies used for immunoblotting were purchased from santa cruz : goat anti-ps <dig> , rabbit anti-erα , goat anti-cathepsin d , and mouse anti-β-actin . immunoblotting for β-actin was performed to ensure equivalent amounts of loaded protein. the densitometric analysis of western blots was performed using bio-rad quantity one computer software.

rt-pcr analysis
rna was extracted using trizol reagent  according to the instructions of the manufacturer. rt-pcr was performed by generating cdna using the first strand cdna synthesis kit . primers used for ps <dig> were forward 5'-gct tct atc cta ata cca tcg acg-3' and reverse 5'-att ttg agt agt caa agt cag agc-3', which amplified a fragment between positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the ps <dig> mrna. 36b <dig> cdna  was used as an estrogen-independent mrna control  <cit> . the 36b <dig> forward primer was 5'-ctc aac atc tcc ccc ttc tc-3'; the reverse was 5'-caa atc cca tat cct cgt cc-3'. the relative induction levels of ps <dig> mrna were calculated using the automated dna/rna electrophoresis had-gt <dig> .

expression of the human znf <dig> gene was measured in multiple cell lines and multiple human tissue cdna libraries. primers used for znf <dig> were forward 5'-ccg att gaa tga aca gcg-3' and reverse 5'-ctc ctg ttt gct cgt ggg-3', while those used for gapdh were forward 5'-ggg agc caa aag ggt cat cat ctc-3' and reverse 5'-cca tgc cag tga gct tcc cgt tc-3'.

statistical analysis
all experiments were repeated three times. all data collected from the luciferase activity assays, emsa, western blot analysis and rt-pcr were expressed as mean ± sd. the data presented in some figures are from representative, repeatable experiments. statistical significance was determined using the student's two-tailed t-test.

bioinformatics analysis of positive genes
chromosomal localization and gene structure were analyzed with reference to the high-throughput genomic sequence database . expression profiles were searched for using gnf symatlas v <dig> . <dig> . the putative cleavage site of signal peptides was predicted using the signal p server . psort ii  software was used to analyze the protein localization. protein domains were searched by the national center for biotechnology information conserved domain database  <cit> .

RESULTS
high-throughput cell-based screening reveals a role for znf <dig> in regulating the activity of erα
our screen for estrogen-suppressing genes involved cotransfecting them into hela cells along with both herα and an ere-luciferase reporter construct . candidate er-repressor gene cdnas were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcdb; this empty vector and brca <dig> were used as the negative and positive control, respectively. reporter gene activity was first normalized to renilla luciferase activity obtained by cotransfection of an internal control prl-tk expression plasmid. as shown in fig. 1a, in the presence of 17β-estradiol , brca <dig> decreased the transcriptional activity of erα to an average level of 60%. we decided that candidate genes that were able to repress erα activity to this degree or further would be selected for further validation. from a library of  <dig> clones tested, we identified  <dig> candidate clones in the first round of screening . four of the  <dig> candidates  were validated as erα pathway repressors in the triplicate verification assays ; their bioinformatics analyses are shown in table  <dig>  human zinc finger protein  <dig>  was identified as the strongest erα transcription repressor  and was selected for further analysis.

a dose-response assay was constructed by transfecting a range of amounts, from  <dig> to  <dig> ng, of the znf <dig> expression vector in the assay . fig. 1c shows that znf <dig> decreased erα transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner.

effect of znf <dig> on the binding of the e2-er complex to ere
to determine how znf <dig> might affect the estrogen signaling pathway, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  to evaluate estrogen-dependent binding of erα to the ere of the xenopus vitellogenin a <dig> gene in nuclear extracts of hela cells. as with our screening assay, cells were transfected with exogenous erα and znf131/pcdb plasmids, and then treated with the indicated concentration of e <dig>  fig.  <dig> shows that znf <dig> inhibited the binding of the e2-erα complex to ere. in nuclear extracts from pcdb-transfected cells, an intense band, corresponding to the er-ere complex, was apparent. the intensity of this band was increased in the presence of an increased concentration of e <dig>  cotransfection with znf <dig> significantly reduced the intensity of the er-ere band. a greater reduction in band intensity was seen when the concentration of e <dig> was raised, suggesting that the inhibition of erα-ere binding by znf <dig> is dependent upon the level of e <dig>  the specificity of binding was confirmed by the disappearance of the band in the presence of excess unlabelled oligonucleotide corresponding to ere.

znf <dig> inhibits expression of ps2
we next determined whether the znf131-mediated inhibition of transcriptional activity might extend to other natural estrogen regulatory sites. we first examined the effect of znf <dig> on the expression of ps <dig>  a faithful endogenous erα-responsive gene whose expression has been widely used as a marker to monitor the regulatory effect of estrogen  <cit> . fig. 3a shows that the protein level of ps <dig> was upregulated by the addition of  <dig> nm estradiol to hela cells transfected with pcdb and exposed to exogenous erα. coincident overexpression of either znf <dig> or brca <dig> reduced the level of ps <dig> protein to almost undetectable levels compared to cells transfected with the control vector. rt-pcr and capillary electrophoresis were also utilized to make quantitative analysis. consistent with the findings from the western blot assay, znf <dig> reduced ps <dig> mrna level by 58% in hela cells in the presence of  <dig> nm estradiol .

to confirm these observations under biological relevant conditions, we repeated these experiments in mcf- <dig> cells, in which the expression of ps <dig> is known to be normally controlled by estrogen . we found that, in these cells, ps <dig> expression in the absence of estrogen was decreased by znf <dig>  but not by brca <dig>  the addition of estrogen led to an increase in ps <dig> protein level, which was suppressed in the presence of either znf <dig> or brca <dig> .

expression profile of znf131
a bioinformatics analysis suggested that znf <dig> is ubiquitously expressed as a member of the poz-zf family of transcription factors. hybridization experiments based on human-tissue-expression blots have shown znf <dig> to be expressed at the highest levels in brain, testis, thymus, and central nervous system  <cit> . we further studied the distribution of human znf <dig> mrna across multiple tissues by rt-pcr . consistent with the published results, znf <dig> was detected in many tissues, with highest levels in brain, testis, and thymus. we also found znf <dig> to be highly expressed in lung tissue. examination of znf <dig> expression in multiple cell lines, showed znf <dig> to be expressed in all but sh-sy5y and b16f <dig> cells .

discussion
estrogen receptor α  signaling pathway is important for normal mammary gland development and the onset of breast cancer. the best-characterized corepressor, ncor, can interact with erα in the presence of erα antagonists. antiestrogen drugs include agents such as tamoxifen, toremefene, raloxifene and fulwestrant. the clinical use of antiestrogens is currently limited to compounds that block the interaction of estrogens of all sources with the erα. although these compounds are useful, none identified to date is purely antiestrogenic, and their clinical effectiveness varies  <cit> . currently, both tamoxifen and raloxifene are most frequently used in breast cancer chemoprevention. however, tamoxifen's antagonist activity was abolished in ncor -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts   <cit> , and raloxifene did not provide protection against noninvasive carcinoma as observed in the core trial  <cit> . thus, finding more erα repressors might be help in designing therapeutic strategies directed toward epigenetic mechanisms in prevention or treatment of breast cancer.

in the present study, we constructed a high-throughput, cell-based functional screening platform by linking a response element  to a reporter gene, which allowed us to quantitatively analyze the cellular activity of erα in cells cotransfected with the candidate genes, in the presence or absence of its cognate ligand e <dig>  we first had to choose an appropriate cell line in which to carry out the assays. cell transfection efficiency, convenience, and cost were each taken into account. the erα positive breast cancer cell lines mcf <dig> and t47d are frequently used to study the influence of genes on the function of erα. however, the poor transfection efficiency achievable using conventional transfection reagent in these cell lines prompted us to seek a substitute. we chose hela cells because they offer good transfection efficiency and are strictly erα af- <dig> permissive  <cit> . because hela cells are erα-negative, our assay required cotransfection of a plasmid expressing erα . the assay described above confirmed that e <dig> was able to activate erα in these cells and erα exogenously introduced into hela cells could restore erα signaling in response to estrogen.

from an initial screen of a library of  <dig> human cdna clones, we identified four genes for further validation, and ultimately identified znf <dig> as the strongest repressor of erα-mediated transactivation.

znf <dig> is a novel gene whose function is not yet well understood. it was isolated and chromosomally mapped in  <dig>  together with a group of  <dig> other novel human zinc finger proteins  <cit> , most of which were considered to be putative candidate genes for developmental and malignant disorders. analysis of the expression profile of znf <dig> revealed it to be ubiquitously expressed in both the human and mouse  <cit> , with a highest expression in adult testis, thymus, and brain. our results are in agreement with this expression pattern, with the additional finding of significant expression in lung.

znf <dig> protein has been placed in the superfamily of pok  proteins, which contain a btb/poz domain in their n-terminal region as well as  <dig> typical c2h <dig> zinc fingers, and an additional c2hc zinc finger structure, in their c-terminus  <cit> . in pok proteins, including znf <dig>  the btb/poz domain putatively confers a specific nuclear localization pattern and mediates transcriptional repression  <cit> . we confirmed the nuclear localization of human znf <dig> in hela cells using a znf131-gfp expression construct .

the potency of znf <dig> in inhibiting erα-mediated transcriptional activity in cultured cells was reflected by its dose-dependent inhibition of ligand-dependent transactivation of erα. emsa assays showed that the addition of estrogen to hela nuclear extracts increased the binding of erα to ere, but that overexpression of znf <dig> impaired this activation by destabilizing the e2-er-ere complex. the action of znf <dig> was specific, dependent on estradiol, and effective even at high estradiol concentrations.

the mcf- <dig> cell line was among the first er-positive human breast cancer cell lines to be characterized as responsive to the mitogenic effects of estrogens in cell culture, as well as in athymic nude mice bearing mcf- <dig> cell xenografts  <cit> . further, mcf- <dig> cells demonstrate estrogen-stimulated expression of a number of well-characterized estrogen-responsive genes, including cathepsin d and ps <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of znf <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells led a marked reduction in the expression of ps <dig> protein, but not of cathepsin d . this suggests that ps <dig> is a specific target gene of znf <dig>  overexpression of znf <dig> in hela cells also repressed ps <dig> mrna and protein level.

the ps <dig> gene product is a well-known estrogen-inducible protein that is expressed in breast and gastrointestinal tissues  <cit> . expression of ps <dig> has been used as a marker of estrogen responsiveness in er containing breast cancer cells, and as a candidate indicator of disease progression to predict the success of antiestrogen therapy. ps <dig>  along with erα, represent strongly favorable prognostic index in breast cancer  <cit> . although elevated expression of ps <dig> predicts a more benign course in breast cancer cases, the mechanism by which this is regulated in human breast cancer cells is not yet well understood. our finding that overexpression of the znf <dig> protein significantly reduced the level of ps <dig> in mcf- <dig> and hela cells might contribute to an understanding of the expression of ps <dig> in normal and neoplastic cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we utilized a high-throughput screening system and identified a protein, znf <dig>  which represses ligand-dependent erα transactivation and is able to regulate expression of the estrogen-responsive gene ps <dig>  this might provide new insight into designing therapeutic and prognostic strategies of breast cancer. our observations suggest that znf <dig> as a new erα repressor correlates with ps <dig>  while cell changes induced by gene overexpression do not necessarily mimic physiological responses in vivo. it is clear that additional studies need to be conducted to understand the regulatory mechanisms and physiological roles of znf <dig>  appropriate in vitro experiments might, first, include the inactivation of znf <dig> through rnai to decrease endogenous protein level. in addition, chip assays might allow further study the mechanism of sequential recruitment of erα-containing protein complexes to estrogen-target promoters, and allow investigators to generate libraries of repressor-bound promoters.
