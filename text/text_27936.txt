BACKGROUND
seedlessness is a desired fruit trait for consumers, and a fruit is considered to be seedless if it produces no seeds, traces of abortion seeds, or significant reduced-number of seeds 
 <cit> . some plants can set seeds asexually through apomixis. however, in most flowering plants, seed initiation requires signals activated by the double fertilization event that occurs in the embryo sac, and seed is produced sexually from the fertilized ovule 
 <cit> . various phytohormones such as gibberellins , auxins and cytokinins are involved in this signaling process 
 <cit> . gas and jasmonic acid/jasmonate derivatives  were found to play crucial roles in plant reproductive development 
 <cit> .

citrus is one of the most important fruit crops with great economic and health value around the world 
 <cit> . however, some citrus varieties are seedy, and seedy fruits have constrained the development of fresh citrus market. therefore, breeding seedless citrus varieties is a long-term pursuit for citrus breeders worldwide 
 <cit> . nowadays, satsuma mandarin and navel orange are two of the most famous and widely grown citrus varieties, mainly due to their seedless trait. for decades, great progress on seedless citrus breeding was made by traditional approaches such as sexual hybridization, seedling and bud sport mutation. however, due to the peculiarities of citrus reproductive biology such as long juvenile period and nucellar polyembryony, traditional breeding is inefficient and costly 
 <cit> . modern biotechnological approaches  have potential to effectively expedite breeding process of citrus 
 <cit> . as most citrus varieties can produce fruits parthenocarpically 
 <cit> , male or female sterility, embryo sac abortion, self-incompatibility, polyploidy and even environmental stress can result in seedless citrus fruits 
 <cit> . actually there were some successful reports about seedless fruit production by genetic transformation. ectopic expression of iaah gene with defh <dig> as promoter to elevate auxin levels in placenta or ovules resulted in seedless fruits 
 <cit> . another effective strategy was by specific expression of toxin proteins during early development of plant reproductive organs. typical cases were the ectopic transformation of the barnase gene from bacillus amyloliquefaciens <cit> . potential cases were by specific expression of enzymes such as chloroplast chaperonin  <dig> and ubiquitin extension protein s27a to induce cell disruption of seed tissues for parthenocarpic plants 
 <cit> . and in our laboratory, the arabidopsis thaliana mac <dig>  gene had been introduced into precocious trifoliate orange  for production of potential seedless fruits 
 <cit> .

male sterility  is one of the main causes for seedless fruit production in citrus. in recent years, great progress on ms was made with annual plants especially rice 
 <cit> , arabidopsis <cit>  and oil-rape 
 <cit> , and a serial of genes regulated tapetum, anther and pollen development were identified. however, there remained very limited information on ms of perennial woody plants such as citrus. ponkan mandarin  is a widely grown citrus variety in china. within this variety, many variants were derived through sexual hybridization and mutation such as bud sport mutation. ‘qianyang seedless’ ponkan mandarin  is an elite seedless variant selected from bud sport mutation of a common seedy ponkan mandarin, and it can set fruits with no seeds  in open orchard 
 <cit> . in this article, qs and a common seedy ponkan mandarin ‘egan no.1’  were used for comparative study. these two mandarins shared highly close genetic relationship based on molecular marker analysis and showed no distinctly morphological differences except that qs was completely male sterile while egan no  <dig> has normal flower. in order to gain general understanding on genes involved in this ms mutation, suppression subtractive hybridization  
 <cit>  combining with cdna microarray was performed to detect differentially expressed genes. several candidate genes and related pathways were focused in particular. our research identified some useful genes which could be beneficial to citrus seedless breeding. the results could help to reveal the molecular mechanism of male sterility of ponkan mandarin and shed light on seedless trait formation of other perennial woody plant at the gene expression level.

RESULTS
phenotype analysis of the floral organs of qs
previous studies suggested that the floral organs  of qs had no morphological difference from the wild type. to further validate the phenotype of this seedless ponkan mandarin, we measured the length of filament and pistil, and the average ratio of filament to pistil  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for eg and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for qs. and for eg, the pistil was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm longer than filament while for qs, the pistil was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm longer than filament. above data further confirmed that the floral organs of both eg and qs had no morphological difference, and the seedless trait was not caused by malformation of reproductive organs. however, the number of pollen grains per anther of qs was  <dig> % less than that of eg. the pollen dying viability of qs was  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  in striking contrast to the high viability of  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  for eg. pollen germination test found that no pollen of qs could germinate. furthermore, sem assays showed abnormal structures of the pollen grains of qs , confirming that qs is male sterile.

construction of ssh-cdna libraries and overall feature of the differential transcript profiling
to identify genes associated with the ms of qs, ssh cdna libraries  were constructed from floral organs of qs and eg. a total of  <dig>  cdna clones derived from the ssh-cdna libraries including  <dig>  from the forward library and  <dig>  from the reverse one were successfully amplified, and then used for a custom cdna microarray. each cdna clone has triplicate spots on the array. the rna samples of the four developmental stages  were used for array-hybridization. the fluorescent dye-labelled cdna and hybridization strategy was employed for the microarray assay.

from the  <dig>  clones printed on the glass slide,  <dig> cdna clones  were differentially expressed  < <dig>  and a fold change ≥ 2) between qs and eg. among these cdna clones,  <dig>  were down-regulated while only  <dig>  showed up-regulated expression across the four developmental stages; and the differentially expressed clones peaked at full bloom stage  . at this stage, many more clones showed down-regulated than up-regulated expression. during the four developmental stages, one clone  encoding a putative cysteine protease  showed down-regulated expression at bf stage but up-regulated at ov stage .

sequencing of the differentially expressed clones and est analysis
among the  <dig> differentially expressed clones,  <dig> non-redundant clones were subjected to one single-pass sequencing. in all,  <dig> high-quality ests  were yielded after eliminating vectors and unreliable sequences. these ests were assembled using cap <dig> program, and  <dig> unigenes  were obtained with sequence redundancy of  <dig> %. the majority of the contigs  contained 2– <dig> ests, whereas only  <dig> contigs contained 6– <dig> ests, indicating an ideal normalization and subtraction. of the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig>  showed differential expression at bf stage. subsequently, blastx search of the uniprot database showed that  <dig> unigens  did not have significant hits . however, when the  <dig> unigenes were used in blastn  search of the citrus clementina transcript database 
 <cit>  with local blast software ,  <dig> genes had significant hits and high scoring pairs  showed high nucleotide identity. it suggested that these  <dig> unigenes were unique for citrus, and three of them were novel citrus genes.

based on the microarray analysis, the relative expression profiles of all  <dig> ests were performed hierarchical clustering with cluster software . four typical relative expression patterns were observed in qs versus eg at four developmental stages. figure 
3a and 
3b showed a group of clones down-regulated mainly at squaring stage  and full bloom stage , respectively, while the other two groups of clones were down/up-regulated constitutively during the developmental stages . in addition, candidate genes with putative function that could be important for the ms of qs were specifically collected . it is noteworthy that  <dig> % of the unigenes  were only annotated as putative proteins or with no defined biological process besides 15% unigenes with no hits in the database.

a the emi codes of the most similar genes to the est sequences.

b the description of sequences based on uniprot database.

c the best e-value from a blastx search for corresponding est sequences.

d the number of sequenced clones in the libraries.

go annotations were conducted and three categories representing molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components were assigned. figure 
 <dig> showed the percentage distributions of go terms  based on biological process. it indicated that during the floral organ development, the majority of differentially expressed genes were involved in metabolic process  or responded to stimulus  and regulation of biological process . in addition, the other two go categories  were also generated . in the molecular function category, large proportion of unigenes may have binding activity , catalytic activity , or oxidoreductase activity , while the cellular components consisted mainly of intracellular  and membrane .

metabolic pathways involved in formation of seedless fruit
as large proportion of altered expressed genes were involved in varieties of metabolic processes. based on the kegg  analysis,  <dig> different metabolic pathways were altered during the four developmental stages. among these pathways, nine  were related to amino acid metabolic pathway , and genes involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism showed down-regulated expression during subsequent developmental stages of floral organs. besides, genes related to specific secondary metabolism such as terpenoids and polyketides metabolism were also found to be altered. interestingly, a gene  encoding fatty acyl-coa reductase, which may be involved in lipid metabolic process, was identified . this gene was found highly homologous with putative male sterile protein  in castor bean, fatty acyl-coa reductase  <dig>  in poplar and male sterile 2-like protein   in arabidopsis. herein, this gene was named as male sterile-like protein. and qrt-pcr analysis showed its expression level increased from sf to bf stages and then declined at ov stage. the expression pattern was similar in both qs and eg; however, it showed obviously higher expression level in qs than in eg during the developmental process .

differential expression of transcription factor genes
it is noteworthy that among the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> were assigned to the category of transcription factor  based on plant tf database . figure 
 <dig> showed the specific expression pattern of six ap2-erf family tfs, two zinc-finger tfs, one myb tf and one nac tf using qrt-pcr assay. these tfs  had similar expression profile during the four developmental stages between eg and qs. for instance, among six ap2-erf tfs, four  showed co-expression pattern like “v” type. it showed that the gene expression level in qs was higher than that in eg from sf stage to mf stage; however, these genes were subsequently repressed more obviously in qs from mf stage to bf stage, and the gene expression level was down-regulated mostly at bf stage. two zinc-finger tfs  and one r2r3-myb tf likewise showed similar “v” type-variation tendency. the other two ap2-erf tfs  showed “v”-like type expression pattern in qs. however, the expression pattern of ap2/erf domain containing tf <dig> was somehow different from others, as it showed relatively stabilized expression level during the four stages in eg. as for nac tf, its expression level was down-regulated obviously at bf and ov stages in qs compare with eg. it was notable that no expression was observed at ov stage in qs. the results suggested that these tfs could play important roles in the seedless phenotype formation, and the relative expression level in qs versus eg seemed to be key factor in this process.

verification of microarray data
two approaches were used to examine the quality of the microarray data. first, as one contig was assembled by several ests that were arrayed at random location in the microarray, so these ests sharing similar sequence or encoding the same gene would share similar expression pattern. additional file 
1: figure s <dig> showed that four ests  were assembled into one unigene  which encoded methionine synthase, and these four ests truly shared similar expression pattern. for the other approach, qrt-pcr was performed on  <dig> unigenes using gene-specific primer pairs. expression patterns were compared at the four developmental stages between qs and eg. additional file 
2: figure s <dig> showed the correlation analysis of the ratio values of differential expression level from microarray to that from qrt-pcr. linear regression  analysis showed a good coefficient of variation . these results confirmed the reliability of the microarray data.

discussion
here, we combined ssh and microarray techniques to investigate potential mechanism underlying seedlessness in ponkan mandarin. ssh was proved to be an efficient and popular approach to enrich and identify differentially expressed genes between wild-type and its mutant or treatment 
 <cit> . however, because of high sensitivity of ssh, usually a large number of clones could be obtained but inevitably included some false-positive ones. screening the ssh libraries to identify some candidate genes using microarray and to validate using qrt-pcr has proved to be a high-throughput and efficient way 
 <cit> . however, relatively few clones were isolated in this study. of the  <dig>  clones, only  <dig> cdna clones were identified as differentially expressed. such results may suggest that there were little variations between qs and eg mandarins in gene expression. it was hypothesized that bud sport mutant was likely caused by single gene mutation, dna methylation or retroelement activity 
 <cit> . in this research, various types of dna markers including scar 
 <cit> , and ssr , msap  and aflp  were employed to analyze the polymorphism between these two mandarins, and no repeatable polymorphic bands were detected . these results suggested that very few nuclear genes were altered during the developmental stages.

for the four developmental stages we chose, immense efforts were taken to determine which time-point was pivotal for stamen development, but there has no criteria for citrus gametophyte development. though criteria for gametophyte development was available in model plant arabidopsis <cit> , it can not be directly applied herein. semi-thin and paraffin sections were performed in this study to survey the microsporogenesis of qs, and it was found that abnormal tetrads produced at the tetrad stage and subsequently the microsporocyte underwent abnormal meiosis. this process mainly occurred at sf stage  . additionally, large proportion  of differentially expressed genes was found in bf when the anthers and pollen grains were almost mature, indicating that this time-point might be also important.

amino acid metabolic process
of the metabolic pathways with altered expressed genes, 25% were involved in amino acid metabolism. amino acids were not only primary metabolic products for normal growth and development but also cell signaling molecules and regulators of gene expression and protein phosphorylation cascade 
 <cit> . interestingly, among these amino acid metabolism pathways, two genes were down-regulated across the developmental stages in qs versus eg, one  encoding glutamate-ammonialigase , the other  encoding beta-glucosidase . in higher plants, glutamate-ammonialigase catalyzes atp-dependent conversion of glutamate and ammonia into glutamine which occupies a central position of amino acid metabolic pathway 
 <cit> , and this metabolic process is critical for coordinating metabolic balance in rice 
 <cit> . and beta-glucosidase could be used for the cellulosic ethanol industry 
 <cit>  and has diversity of functions in plants. in maize, zm-p <dig>  encoding a beta-glucosidase could release active cytokinin, and might function in vivo to supply the developing maize embryo 
 <cit> . additionally, some beta-glucosidases affect the properties of cell wall 
 <cit>  and are associated with freezing tolerance, such as the sfr <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> . some beta-glucosidases are related to the efficiency of microspore embryogenesis 
 <cit> . it is noteworthy that a gene  encoding asparagine synthase  was down-regulated exclusively at sf . and asparagine is one central intermediate in nitrogen assimilation and transportation in plant 
 <cit> . recent studies showed that this gene played important role in defense against pathogens and salt stress 
 <cit> . additionally, genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism also showed down-regulated expression in qs mainly at bf and ov . these results suggested that the vital activities of qs weakened during early development stages of stamen, and the metabolic process of nutrition and energy was also impaired at subsequent stages of stamen development especially when the stamen was mature.

two genes involved in cysteine/methionine metabolism and participated in the biosynthesis of ethylene were also identified in this study. one  encodes 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine s-methyltransferase  is likely involved in the biosynthesis of l-methionine. and the methionine can be transformed into s-adenosylmethionine   
 <cit> . the other one  encodes aminocyclopropane carboxylate oxidase  and is a pivotal enzyme during the biosynthesis of ethylene. in addition, genes involved in the synthesis of iaa  were also identified such as a gene  encoding indole-3-acetatebeta-glucosyltransferase . these results implied that the endogenous phytohormones might be involved in the male gametophyte development of citrus.

transcription factors
it was known that floral organ formation and function were influenced by tfs regulation. in our research, twelve unigenes were assigned to the category of transcription factor, and six of them were identified as ap2-erf family members. ap2-erf tf containing highly conserved ap2/erf dna-binding domain, is a large family unique in plant. in our research, four ap2-erf members showed similar expression pattern. ap2-erebp tf <dig> was closely homologous with aterf <dig> . this gene was likely involved in the regulation of gene expression by stress factors and by components of stress signal transduction pathways. however, until now, no experimental evidence was available. ap2-erebp tf <dig> showed high similarity with erf <dig> . erf <dig> might play an important role in plant innate immunity likely through coordinating chitin and other defense pathways 
 <cit> . other research suggested that erf <dig> and erf <dig> might potentially overlap in their function and acted as positive regulators of ja/ethylene-mediated defense 
 <cit> . in tomato, this gene was mainly involved in responses to drought and salt stresses 
 <cit> . as for ap2/erf domain containing tf <dig>  its closest relative was erf <dig> . recent studies showed that erf <dig> was in vivo substrate of mpk <dig>  and ethylene could release erf <dig> and allow liberated erf <dig> to access target genes related to plant defense 
 <cit> . cbf/dreb-like tf was of high similarity with cbf <dig>  which was critical regulator involved in cold acclimation and drought adaptation 
 <cit> .

in addition, ap2-erebp tf <dig> was highly homologous with rap <dig>  . rap <dig>  acted at or downstream of a converging point of light and ethylene signaling pathways, and it coordinately regulated multiple developmental processes and stress responses 
 <cit> . as for ap2-erf domain containing tf <dig>  its expression pattern was different from other five members. it showed high similarity with dreb <dig> . in plant, rap <dig> , rap <dig>  l, dreb <dig> and dreb <dig> exhibited tissue specific expression and participated developmental processes as well as biotic and/or abiotic stress signaling 
 <cit> . though previous researches emphasized the functions of these ap2-erf tfs on resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses, ap2-erf tfs were also participated in plant development such as embryo patterning 
 <cit> , and stamen emergence 
 <cit> .

additionally, two myb  transcription factors also showed differential expression between qs and eg. in plant, myb tf family was categorized into  <dig> subfamilies according to the number of adjacent repeats of myb-domain. of them, r2r3-myb subfamily contains the largest number of members. like the ap2-erf tf family proteins, myb family proteins also function in various plant-specific processes. in arabidopsis, myb tfs were found as key regulators involved in development, metabolism and biotic and abiotic stress responses. among these myb tfs of arabidopsis, atmyb <dig> is involved in determining endothecial cell development within the anther and is essential for anther dehiscence 
 <cit> . atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> redundantly facilitate anther and pollen development 
 <cit> . atmyb <dig> regulates exine formation and acts downstream of atmyb35; and atmyb <dig> is required for tapetal development and microsporogenesis, especially for callose dissolution and exine formation 
 <cit> . atmyb <dig> positively control male germ cell division and commit progenitor germ cells to sperm cell differentiation 
 <cit> . in rice, csa gene encoding myb tf functions as a key transcriptional regulator for sugar partitioning during male reproductive development, and the csa mutant showed reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs which lead to ms.

interestingly, in our results, one myb tf showed similar expression pattern with ap2-erf tfs that down-regulated at bf stage when the anther and pollen grains are mature. this myb tf termed as r2r3-myb tf was closely related to atmybr1/atmyb <dig> , and atmyb <dig> was likely to enhance drought and salt stress tolerance by suppressing the expression of genes encoding pp2cs, which was described as negative regulators of aba signaling 
 <cit> . previous report showed that atmyb <dig> was with changed expression during late embryogenesis and seed maturation 
 <cit> . and notably there was a nac domain protein  highly homologous with anac <dig> . anac <dig> was an important regulator of seed germination and activated a seed-specific subset of genes under low-oxygen stress; it was also necessary for the viability of arabidopsis seeds following low-oxygen treatment 
 <cit> .

in summary, these results suggested that these ap2-erf tfs and the myb tf functioned redundantly and coordinated with other tfs which involved in the complex network regulating floral organ development. further research should emphasize on the isolation of proteins interacted with these tfs.

CONCLUSIONS
an integrative approach combining ssh and microarray was employed to explore the transcriptional changes of a seedless bud sport mutant of ponkan mandarin. a number of differentially expressed genes were identified. and the majority of genes were down-regulated in the mutant, especially those related to basic metabolic process. metabolism of nutrition and energy might be impaired during male gametophyte development of the mutant, and tfs and phytohormones might play important regulatory roles during this process. our research gained general information of citrus ms at transcription level and could provide some clues for further exploration of ms in citrus species.
