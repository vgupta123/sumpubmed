BACKGROUND
osteosarcoma  is the most common primary malignant bone tumour in children and adolescents, although its incidence in dogs is ten times greater than in humans  <cit> . spontaneously occurring osteosarcomas in dogs are an ideal model for cancer research due to their anatomical and physiological similarities with human counterparts .

we had previously shown that the basic leucine zipper  domain-containing transcription factor, zhangfei/crebzf/smile inhibits the growth and the unfolded protein response  in the d– <dig> canine osteosarcoma  cell line  <cit>  and that the effects of zhangfei are mediated by stabilizing the tumour suppressor protein p <dig>  <cit> . to determine if our observations with d– <dig> cells applied more universally to canine os, we examined three other independently isolated canine os cell lines—abrams, mckinley  <cit>  and gracie  <cit> . the purpose of this study was to determine the inhibitory role of zhangfei in these os cell lines by exploring its potential involvement in growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and metastasis.

zhangfei was initially identified through its interaction with the host cell factor  a protein required for the initiation of herpes simplex virus gene expression  <cit> . unlike other blzip transcription factors, zhangfei appears to be incapable of binding to consensus blzip response elements as a homodimer  <cit> . instead, it fulfills its role in transcriptional regulation by hetero-dimerizing with and modulating other transcription factors or signaling molecules, such as luman/creb <dig>  <cit> , xbp <dig>  <cit> , atf <dig>  <cit> , smad  <dig> , <dig>  <cit> , herpes simplex virus vp <dig>  <cit> , and p <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
all four canine os cells lines express functional p53
to confirm the effects of zhangfei we had observed in d– <dig> os cells we examined three other canine os cell lines. we have shown that zhangfei exerts its effect on cell growth and the upr by stabilizing p <dig>  <cit>  and it therefore has no effect on cancer cells that do not possess functional p <dig>  to assess the status of p <dig> in the canine cell lines we amplified p <dig> transcripts from the cells using pcr and determined the nucleotide sequences of the products. figure 1b shows the derived amino acid sequences of p <dig> from the cell lines and the reference sequence from the canine genome database. all four cell lines contained transcripts for p <dig> that, with the exception of a few amino acid variations, were identical to the reference sequence. none of the amino acid polymorphisms in the sequences were at positions identified as important for p <dig> function  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

to determine if the p <dig> proteins in the cell lines were functionally active, we transfected the cells with a plasmid that expressed the reporter protein chloramphenicol acetyl transferase  regulated by a promoter with two copies of a p <dig> response element . as a negative control, cells were transfected with a plasmid  without the response elements. parallel cultures were transfected with a plasmid expressing zhangfei. figure 1c shows that expression of cat was activated in all four cell lines in a p <dig> response element–dependent manner and that the presence of zhangfei enhanced expression.

cellular outcome following ectopic expression of zhangfei: growth arrest, apoptosis and differentiation
we next compared the effect of zhangfei on the growth characteristics of abrams, mckinley, and gracie cells with its effect on d– <dig> cells. the cells were infected with adenovirus expressing either zhangfei  or the control protein β-galactosidase . cell growth was monitored by the wst- <dig> cell proliferation assay. in agreement with previous results, all four adeno-zf-infected cells failed to divide as early as day  <dig> after infection as determined by their ability to convert wst- <dig> cell proliferation reagent and absorb light at 405 nm. mock infected cells continued to grow for three days and the growth of adeno-lacz-infected cells was indistinguishable from mock-infected cells . apoptosis was induced in all four cell lines as a result of zhangfei expression . d– <dig> and abrams appeared to be more sensitive as cultures had substantial numbers of apoptotic cells at 24 hr. the response in mckinley and gracie, was slower with cultures showing  <dig> to 34% apoptotic cells by 48 hr. since the level of p <dig> in response to zhangfei was similar in all the cell lines the quantitative differences in the induction of apoptosis suggests that zhangfei may have effects that are, at least partially, independent of p <dig> figure  <dig> 
ectopic expression of zhangfei suppresses cell growth in canine osteosarcomas. d– <dig>  abrams, mckinley, and gracie canine os cells were mock-infected or infected with adenovirus vectors expressing either zhangfei  or β-galactosidase  and growth rates were measured  by absorbance at 405 nm with wst- <dig> at different time points after infection. error bars indicate standard deviations from means of three individual experiments. standard deviations from means of three individual experiments are shown and significance  was determined using anova. . zhangfei was detected by immunoblotting using antiserum against zhangfei.
zhangfei causes canine osteosarcoma cells to commit apoptosis. d– <dig>  abrams, mckinley and gracie cells, mock-infected or infected with adeno-zf or adeno-lacz or treated with 50 μm etoposide  were stained with fluorescent annexin v and propidium iodide. unstained cells or cells staining with either or both dyes were enumerated by facs. a <dig> represents the percentage of total cells undergoing apoptosis. for mckinley and gracie only reading for 48 hr are shown. differences between lacz and zf-expressing cells were more pronounced at that time-point.



since the effect of zhangfei was most dramatic on d– <dig> and abrams cells we selected them for further analysis. zhangfei may stop cell growth by inducing differentiation and/or causing apoptosis, we therefore performed a transcript level analysis of the os differentiation marker—osteocalcin  <cit>  in d– <dig> and abrams cells infected with either adeno-zf or adeno-lacz. compared with lacz-expressing and even vitamin d3-treated cells , zhangfei significantly increased the expression of osteocalcin transcripts in a time-dependent manner .figure  <dig> 
zhangfei induces differentiation of canine osteosarcoma cells. d– <dig> and abrams cells were either mock-infected or infected with adeno-zf or adeno-lacz. the positive control cells were treated with 10-5 mm vitamin d <dig>  the mrna levels of osteoblast differentiation marker  were estimated by qrt-pcr. standard deviations from means and p values as calculated using a student t-test are shown.



expression of zhangfei inhibits the ability of canine osteosarcoma cells to close a scratch wound
migratory behaviour in cancer cells is a typical hallmark of malignancy. to investigate whether ectopic expression of zhangfei correlated with altered migratory behaviour, we performed cell motility assays on the canine os cultures. following scratch wounding, wound closure was significantly slower in cultures  infected with adeno-zf compared to cultures infected with adeno-lacz or mock-infected cells , showing that the ectopic expression of zhangfei indeed causes decreased cell motility in canine osteosarcoma cells. however, it is also possible that the decrease in ability of zhangfei-expressing cells to grow heal the scratch wound may be because of a decrease in growth rates rather than a decrease in the ability to migrate.figure  <dig> 
ectopic expression of zhangfei causes decreased ability of canine osteosarcoma cells to repair a scratch wound.  scratch wounds were made in 100% confluent cultures of d– <dig> or abrams cells mock-infected or infected with adeno-zf or adeno-lacz. phase contrast images were taken at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hours after infection from identical regions.  the wound size relative to the starting wound size was measured at each time point after infection in three independent experiments and expressed as a percentage reduction in wound size + standard deviation. significance of differences of means  were determined using anova.



zhangfei negatively regulates the upr in canine osteosarcomas
the unfolded protein response  is an adaptive cellular stress response that alleviates er stress or, failing, induces apoptosis. in previous studies, we found zhangfei was a negative regulator of the upr in d– <dig> canine os cells  <cit> . to investigate if zhangfei could consistently suppress the upr in other canine os cells, the four canine os cell lines infected with either adeno-zf or adeno-lacz were treated with the upr pharmacological inducer thapsigargin, or were deprived of glucose. the latter treatment is a known physiological inducer of the upr. both treatments increased the level of transcripts for upr transcripts xbp1s, herp, chop and grp <dig>  and zhangfei suppressed the transcripts in thapsigargin treated  and glucose deprived  cells. in contrast, lacz had no obvious effect. in addition, this decrease in mrna was reflected in a decrease in upr proteins  in thapsigargin-treated d– <dig>  <cit>  and abrams  cells. figure 6e, which showed intracellular proteins detected by immunofluorescence, also supported these data—the xbp1s protein was undetectable in d– <dig> and abrams cells expressing zhangfei.figure  <dig> 
zhangfei negatively regulates the unfolded protein responses  in canine osteosarcomas.  d– <dig> cells were left untreated, treated with thapsigargin or grown in glucose free medium. twelve hours later cells were harvested and transcripts for the upr- linked genes xbp1s, herp, chop and grp <dig> estimated by qrt-pcr. cells were mock-infected or infected with either adeno-zf or adeno-lacz and then treated with thapsigargin  or deprived of glucose . 24 hr later cells were harvested and transcripts for upr genes estimated. proteins in thapsigargin-treated mock-infected and adeno-zf-infected cells were detected by immunoblots  and immunofluorescence . dotted lines in a and b indicate a 2-fold difference. values greater than  <dig> fold were considered significant.



CONCLUSIONS
canine os is an aggressive tumour that accounts for approximately 85% of primary bone tumours in the dog  <cit> . os causes local skeletal destruction resulting in osteoproductive and osteolytic lesions, and it is highly metastatic to the lungs. although there has been dramatic progress in the standard treatments of os, including amputation, chemotherapy, and palliative radiation therapy, these therapies often fail, leading to recurrence of the tumour and metastatic spread  <cit> . over the years, combined therapies, such as chemotherapy combined with immune modulators, have been practiced on dog os  <cit> , although with poor overall survival times.

the dog is a well-established model for spontaneous os in humans, owing to striking similarity in biology and gene expression. the large size of dogs, relative outbreeding, and immunocompetence increase their model potential. furthermore, dogs with spontaneous tumors naturally develop therapy resistance and metastasis. in addition, tumor burdens in spontaneously arising cancers of dogs are more similar to humans than the experimentally induced tumors found in murine models, which may be important with regard to biologic factors such as hypoxia and clonal variation. the size of canine tumors also allows for serial imaging and tissue collection over time  <cit> .

in previous studies, we found that the transcription factor crebzf/zhangfei suppressed the growth of d– <dig> dog os cells  <cit> . herein, we further discovered that the growth suppressive effects of zhangfei were applicable to three other independently isolated canine os cell lines as well.

the unfolded protein response  is an adaptive response induced by endoplasmic reticulum  stress, which alleviates er stress by up-regulating the expression of er-resident chaperons  <cit> , inducing er-associated protein degradation , and down-regulating the synthesis of new proteins  <cit> . if these mechanisms are not sufficient to alleviate er stress, then an apoptosis program is initiated to induce cell death. our previous results  <cit>  suggest that zhangfei is a potential regulator of the upr, and it might accelerate upr feedback mechanisms by interacting with the upr mediator-xbp <dig> and targeting it for proteasomal degradation. in the present study, the strong inhibitory effects of zhangfei on both pharmacological  and physiological  –induced upr was also observed in the four canine os cell lines we examined.

zhangfei suppresses the upr and cell growth by stabilizing the tumour suppressor protein p <dig>  <cit> . all four canine os cell lines we examined express functional p <dig> . these results suggest that the induction of zhangfei expression in canine os may be an effective strategy for suppressing cell growth and metastasis. however, the strategy would likely only be successful with os that have functional p <dig>  a large proportion of human cancers have deleted or otherwise non-functional p <dig>  at present we do not know the proportion of canine os that have inactive p <dig>  some studies  <cit>  suggest that most canine os do not have deletions or major rearrangements in the gene for p <dig>  although 30–50% of p <dig> coding sequences in canine os have polymorphisms  <cit>  the effect of these changes on p <dig> functionality is unknown. it is therefore difficult to determine how universally applicable zhangfei would be as a modality for treating canine os. the role of p <dig> in canine os is also controversial. the expression of ectopic p <dig> in canine os cells, both in vitro and in vivo models leads to reduced tumour growth and an increase in apoptotic cells  <cit> . in contrast, other studies in both humans  <cit>  and dogs  <cit>  suggest that increased p <dig> expression in os correlates with more aggressive tumours and decreases survival time.
