BACKGROUND
most economically important traits are quantitative in nature and are determined by many genes and gene complex where are described as quantitative trait loci   <cit> . traditional methods of genetic improvement of quantitative traits have relied mainly on phenotype and pedigree information  <cit> , which are easily influenced by environmental factors. genetic markers have made it possible to detect qtl that are significantly associated with traits  <cit> , and made selection more effective. genetic response can be improved by including the qtl in marker-assisted selection, which is a method of selection that makes use of phenotypic, genotypic and pedigree data  <cit> .

linkage maps are essential for mapping qtl  <cit> . in the past, genotyping of many markers was expensive, therefore, specific experimental designs were developed to reduce the impact of having fewer markers on statistical power  <cit> . more recently, however, high throughput methods have been developed to genotype markers such as microsatellites  <cit>  and single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> , which have significantly reduced the cost. linkage maps have been constructed for a number of foodfish species, such as salmon  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , catfish  <cit> , tilapia  <cit> , grass carp  <cit> , common carp  <cit> , asian seabass  <cit> , european seabass  <cit>  and japanese flounder  <cit> , gilthead seabream sparus aurata  <cit>  using rapd, aflp and microsatellites. only in a few species, linkage maps solely based on codominant dna markers  were constructed. most linkage maps in food fish species are not dense in comparison to these linkage maps in model fish species , chicken  <cit> , live stock species  and agronomic plant species . qtl mapping in foodfish species is still in its infancy  <cit> . only in a few species, such as asian seabass  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , tilapia  <cit> , japanese flounder  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit>  and european seabass  <cit> , qtl for growth, meat quality, stress and disease resistance have been mapped in large genomic regions due to lack of a high resolution linkage map.

linkage map with sequence-based markers is also a platform for comparative genome studies  <cit> . recent comparative genome analyses based on genetic maps have already provided new insights into genome organization, evolution, and function across different organisms  <cit> . for example, comparison of the caenorhabditis briggsae genetic map and the caenorhabditis elegans genome reveals extensive conservation of chromosome organization and synteny despite a very long divergence time , suggesting that natural selection operates at the level of chromosomal organization  <cit> . in another study, a genetic linkage map of the blind mexican cavefish astyanax mexicanus has been successfully applied to predict candidate quantitative trait genes relating to rib number and eye size by anchoring cavefish qtls to the zebrafish genome  <cit> . blast searches of sequences of mapped markers of grass carp against the whole genome sequence of zebrafish revealed substantial macrosynteny relationship and extensive colinearity of markers between grass carp and zebrafish  <cit> . identification of conserved synteny blocks across fish genomes would help to unravel ancestral genome architecture of fish and transfer genome information from model fish species to non-model foodfish species.

asian seabass, lates calcarifer, also called barramundi, is one of the important foodfish species. this species has been cultured for more than  <dig> years in brackish-water ponds and in recent years in floating cages. the global annual production of asian seabass was currently  <dig>  metric tons according to fao statistics  <cit> . in the past few years, we started a breeding program for asian seabass  <cit>  and developed a number of genomic tools such as microsatellites  <cit> , snps in genes  <cit> , microrna  <cit> , a linkage map with  <dig> microsatellites  <cit> , bac and cdna libraries  <cit>  and a bac-based physical map  <cit>  to facilitate the selective breeding program. the linkage map has been used to map qtl for growth traits, and significant qtl for growth traits were mapped on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . however, due to the lack of markers in the qtl regions, it is impossible to map the qtl in smaller chromosomal regions. for fine mapping qtl, comparative analysis of synteny and searching for candidate genes in qtl region, a high-density linkage map is essential.

in this report we present a second generation linkage map of asian seabass. the current updated version of the asian seabass consensus linkage map is a considerable improvement compared with the previous version  <cit> . this linkage map allowed for carrying out comparative mapping of synteny between asian seabass and tetraodon nigroviridis, and enabled fine mapping of qtl for growth traits. in addition, we identified potential candidate genes in qtl for growth traits, and defined the phenotypic consequences of alternative candidate gene alleles.

RESULTS
identification and genotyping of dna markers
a total of  <dig> clones collected from libraries enriched for ca-, ga-, caa- gaca- and gata-microsatellites were sequenced in both directions. two thousand and eight hundred clones contained microsatellites, yielding  <dig> unique sequences. among the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> had enough flanking regions for primer design. the first set of  <dig> primer pairs was used to amplify three parents from two reference families  <cit>  for linkage mapping. six hundreds and sixty primers were selected to genotype the two reference families including  <dig> individuals  due to the fact that these primers could amplify easily scorable pcr products. among the  <dig> microsatellite markers,  <dig> were tetranucleotide microsatellites, which could be more easily scored than the di-nucleotide microsatellites . ten snps in nine genes were genotyped by direct sequencing each individual in the two reference families.

linkage mapping
of  <dig> informative markers including  <dig> markers mapped in the first generation linkage map  <cit> ,  <dig> markers were assigned to linkage groups by two-point linkage analysis with lod scores > <dig>  using crimap . from this, a total of  <dig>  markers were mapped by multipoint linkage analysis. among these markers,  <dig> initiated with lcab were microsatellites isolated from bac clones,  <dig> lcae from ests and  <dig> snps from genes . details about primer sequences, genbank accession number, annealing temperature for pcr, pcr product size, and locations of the  <dig> markers are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

in most regions, the order of the markers on the new map was consistent with the previous map  <cit> , although some regions were rearranged through incorporating the new markers and correcting old marker data. the current sex-averaged map spanned  <dig>  cm of the asian seabass genome . in the map, the intermarker distance was  <dig>  cm. these  <dig> markers were located in  <dig> unique locations on the linkage map of the asian seabass, with an average inter-location space of  <dig>  cm .

lg: linkage group; *: data is shown as number of markers mapped/unique locations; **: data is shown as cm/marker and cm/unique marker location

sex-specific maps were also constructed. the length of the male map was  <dig>  cm, with an average intermarker distance of  <dig>  cm whereas the female map was  <dig>  cm long, with an average intermarker spacing of  <dig>  cm. the male map comprised linkage groups ranging in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm while the female map contained linkage groups with a length ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm.

the distances between lcab <dig> and lcate <dig> at the end region of lg <dig>  are  <dig> and  <dig>  cm on female and male map respectively, while the distances between lca <dig> and lcate <dig> in the near middle region of lg <dig>  possible proximal to centromere region, are  <dig>  and  <dig> cm on female and male map respectively. similarly, in the end regions between lcae <dig> and lcab <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> and lcate <dig> on lg <dig>  lcate <dig> and lcae <dig> on lg <dig> and lca <dig> and lca <dig> on lg <dig>  females had much lower recombination rates in telomeric regions than males. while in the near middle regions, possibly within regions proximal to the centromere between lca <dig> and lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lcab <dig> and lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> and lcate <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> and lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> and lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lcate <dig> and lcate <dig> on lg <dig>  recombination rates were much higher in females. it showed that females have much lower recombination rates in telomeric regions than males, while recombination rates were much higher in females within regions proximal to the centromere.

comparative genome analysis
we used blat to identify homologs of the sequence-based markers of lates calcarifer on the map. sixty seven markers had a homolog and could be assigned to the chromosomes of tetraodon nigroviridis. we compared the lates calcarifer genetic map with assembled genome sequences of tetraodon nigroviridis, identifying conserved synteny blocks in  <dig> of the  <dig> lates calcarifer linkage groups, each of which contained  <dig> to  <dig> markers. the largest synteny block conserved between lates calcarifer and tetraodon nigroviridis was found in lg <dig> with  <dig> markers spanning  <dig> cm in the lates calcarifer linkage group and their best matches spanning  <dig> mb in chromosome  <dig> of the tetraodon nigroviridis genome . blasting sequences of dna markers of asian seabass against whole genome sequences of zebrafish and medaka detected only very few conserved synteny .

fine mapping qtl
additional  <dig> novel microsatellites located near qtl for growth traits on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> were selected and mapped with qtl panel containing  <dig> offspring. the linkage map was significantly improved for further qtl mapping as compared to the previous map by enhancing the density of markers for refinement of qtl positions . qtl analysis was carried out with genotype data of the markers and phenotypic data of all the progeny in the qtl mapping panel.

qtl affecting body weight, total length and standard length were identified on an experiment-wise scale. the experiment-wise lod significance thresholds were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for body weight, total length and standard length, respectively, while the linkage-group-wise lod significance thresholds varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . eleven qtl controlling body weight, total length and standard length were detected on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  multiple qtl model  mapping with initial qtl did not change the results.

for each qtl detected, the confidence interval , linkage group maximum lod score, and percentage of the phenotypic variance explained  are indicated. the experiment-wise lod significance thresholds are  <dig>  for body weight, and  <dig>  for total length and body length. mean phenotypic values of each trait were also calculated for those progeny with the alternate alleles at the most closely linked microsatellite markers, inherited from the male parent , alleles from the female parent . **: experiment-wise significant qtl; * linkage-group-wise significant qtl.

the three qtl qbw2-a, qtl2-a and qsl2-a near the marker lca <dig> showed high percentage of phenotypic variance explained  of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . these qtl together with qbw2-b are consistent to the previous qtl mapping results and their positions were finely refined as discussed later on.

due to the more markers integrated in the qtl region, five qtl, i.e. qbw2-c, qbw2-d, qbw2-e, qtl2-c and qtl2-d, were newly detected. although lod values of qsl2-a and qsl2-c were not higher than the significant threshold, we still listed qsl2-a and qsl2-c to table  <dig> as they showed obvious peaks and the lod scores were very close to the threshold.

on lg <dig>  the peaks of qbw2-a and qbw2-b were flanked by lca <dig> and lca <dig> with distance  <dig>  cm, and closely linked to lca <dig> with a distance of  <dig> cm. similarly, the peaks of the other qtl  were located in a small region between flanking markers, with intervals of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively. on lg <dig>  qbw <dig> was located in an interval of  <dig>  cm between lca <dig> and lca <dig>  the lod peaks were detected near the positions of markers lca <dig>  lca <dig>  lcate <dig>  lca <dig> and lca <dig> respectively .

potential candidate genes in refined qtl
as positions of some microsatellites collocating with qtl peaks, sequences of these dna markers were blasted against the whole genome sequences of zebrafish and medaka. we detected some potential candidate genes for growth. among these markers, a qtl cluster including qbw2-c, qtl2-c and qsl2-c were located in between markers lca <dig> and lca <dig> with distance of  <dig>  cm, and qtl peaks collocated with the position of lca <dig>  whose sequence hit to genome sequences at  <dig>  mb on the chromosome  <dig>  in zebrafish, and at  <dig>  mb chromosome  <dig>  in medaka . when looking closely, we found that the sequence of the marker lca <dig> showed very high similarity of the cathepsin d gene of medaka and zebrafish. we also found that the lca <dig> showed similarity to the cathepsin d gene  of rainbow trout. comparing the sequences of lca <dig> to all  <dig>  est sequences generated by our group ; we found that lca <dig> was located in the cathepsin d gene of asian seabass.

the peak of qbw2-e was located between the markers lca568/lcate <dig> and lca <dig> with distance of  <dig>  cm . the sequence of the marker lca <dig> hit to genome sequences at  <dig>  mb on the chromosome  <dig>  in medaka, and some of the sequences of the marker lca <dig> showed very high similarity of the kctd <dig> gene of medaka. the sequences of lcate <dig> hit to genome sequences at  <dig>  mb on the chromosome  <dig>  in zebrafish, and some of the sequences of the marker lcate <dig> showed very high similarity of the csmd <dig> gene of zebrafish.

for lca <dig>  lcate <dig> and lca <dig>  there were no hits to genes in medaka and zebrafish genomes.

effects of gene allele substitution
a two-way anova was performed on the  <dig> progeny using four allelic combinations  from markers in the three candidate genes of cathepsin d, kctd <dig> and csmd <dig> in order to investigate associations between traits and genotypes of these genes. the phenotype values of each allelic combination of these three genes are listed in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  significant differences of phenotype means among different allelic combinations were identified, revealing the effects of alternate gene alleles inherited from the parents. progeny with m2f <dig> genotype at the marker lca <dig> located in cathepsin d, showed the highest phenotype values. similarly, progeny with m1f <dig> genotype at the marker lca <dig> located in kctd <dig> and lcate <dig> in csmd <dig>  showed the highest phenotype values. these results suggested the effect of these genes on growth related traits.

discussion
map density and recombination rate
the linkage map presented in this paper represents one of the most dense linkage maps based on microsatellites and snps for foodfish species. this second generation linkage map of asian seabass contained  <dig>  times as many sequence-based co-dominant loci as did the previous linkage map  <cit> , and more sequence-based co-dominant markers than the linkage maps of major foodfish species, such as salmon  <cit> , tilapia  <cit> , common carp  <cit> , grass carp  <cit> , japanese flounder  <cit> , catfish  <cit>  and european seabass  <cit> . however, in comparison to the linkage maps of model fish species , livestock , chicken  <cit> ) and agronomical plant species   <cit> , catfish   <cit> , tilapia   <cit> , grass carp   <cit> , human , mouse   <cit>  and lower than the plant arabidopsis thaliana . based on the genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit>  we estimated the average intermarker distance to be approximately  <dig>  mb in the new linkage map which consisting  <dig> markers. this suggests that qtl, if identified, can be narrowed down to rather small genomic regions. the enhanced map will be invaluable not only for qtl and gene mapping but also for comparative genome analysis and assembling the asian seabass genome once the whole genome sequencing available.

sex-specific patterns of recombination
different recombination rates between the sexes have been reported in mammals  <cit>  and other fish species  <cit>  with female map distances usually greater than those in male maps  <cit> . in japanese flounder, the recombination rate was unusually higher in males  compared to females  <cit> . different to the previous map  <cit> , the overall sizes of the male and female maps are comparable . females had much lower recombination rates in telomeric regions than males, while recombination rates were much higher in females within regions proximal to the centromere. females have much lower recombination rates in telomeric regions than males on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while recombination rates are much higher in females within regions possibly proximal to the centromere on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this is similar to linkage map of rainbow trout  <cit> .

qtl fine mapping
to improve the utility of the qtl in mas, and to move toward the positional cloning of candidate genes, fine mapping of the qtl to a smaller region of the chromosome is necessary  <cit> . in foodfish species, although qtl mapping has been conducted in a few species, such rainbow trout  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , japanese flounder  <cit>  and tilapia  <cit> , qtl were mapped in large genomic regions, usually bigger than  <dig> cm. in asian seabass, the number of available markers on our previous map  <cit>  limited the possibility for fine mapping qtl in asian seabass; therefore the development of additional markers in the qtl regions is an important target in this study. as compared to the previous qtl mapping results, the positions of qtl were much refined with the markers from the enhanced map . the peaks of qbw2-a and bw2-b were flanked by lca <dig> and lca <dig> with distance reduced from  <dig>  cm on previous map to  <dig>  cm, and closely linked to lca <dig> with a distance of  <dig>  cm. similarly, the peaks of the other qtl  was refined from  <dig>  cm on previous map to a small region between flanking markers, with intervals  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively. on lg <dig>  qbw <dig> was from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. the refined qtl supply a basis for identifying potential candidate genes located in these refined qtl through comparative genome analysis. fortunately, the complete genome sequences of several mode fish species   <cit>  are available, and the sequencing of genomes of several important foodfish species  are in progress.

comparative genome analysis
methods to map sequence based markers and to compare maps with relevant model systems are crucial to extend genomic-level analysis to non-model species  <cit> . according to the phylogenetic tree including over  <dig> fish species, constructed using  <dig> mitochondrial genes in our previous study, asian seabass is more closely related to t. nigroviridis than to zebrafish and medaka  <cit> . however, in our previous comparative mapping, no synteny block could be identified between aisan seabass and t. nigroviridis although flanking sequences of  <dig> microsatellites showed high similarity to known genomic dna sequences of t. nigroviridis  <cit> . herein, we developed our second generation linkage map with high density and demonstrated that,  <dig> syteny blocks of asian seabass were syntenic to the  <dig> counterparts of t. nigroviridis chromosomes. the result showed certain colinearity for the  <dig> syntenic chromosome/linkage pairs between the two foodfish species, t. nigroviridis and asian seabass. the conserved syntenies identified here between the asian seabass and t. nigroviridis should facilitate studies on genome evolution and analysis of structural genome, but more importantly should facilitate functional inference of genes in asian seabass. it is well known that determination of gene functions is difficult in non-model species; functional genome analysis will have to rely heavily on the establishment of homologies from model species. mapping more ests or gene sequences on the linkage map of asian seabass should enhance comparative mapping, thereby transferring genome information from model species to asian seabass.

identification of candidate genes in qtl
maps with sequence-based markers are useful not only for comparative genomics but also resolving mapped genomic regions to a tractable number of candidate genes, especially if there is synteny with related model species. after refining the positions of qtl, the regions of candidate genes were delimited more precisely. the lod peaks were detected near the positions of markers lca <dig>  lca <dig>  lcate <dig>  lca <dig> and lca <dig> respectively, therefore we examined regions of the sequenced zebrafish and medaka genome corresponding to the qtl regions on asian seabass, using the markers overlapped on qtl lod peaks. such an approach allows us to prioritize our research effort on candidate genes that are found collocating with qtl lod peaks. candidate gene approaches have been successfully used for identification of qtl  <cit> . three putative growth-related genes, cathepsin d, kctd <dig> and csmd <dig>  were found to be positioned directly at qtl peaks between small region of  <dig> - <dig>  cm, making them the strongest candidate genes for growth traits. further two-way anova revealed that allelic substitution at these two genes showed significant effects on growth-related traits. certain allelic combinations showed significantly higher values of the growth traits. the candidate genes are rare examples of qtl fine mapping in foodfish species. interestingly, the qtl cluster at lca <dig> underlying growth traits of asian seabass showed similarity to the cathepsin d gene of human, which is related to cancer  <cit>  and alzheimer's disease  <cit>  and has become a hotspot of human genetics study. the genotypes at these genes may be useful for growth improvement through marker-assisted selection, gene cloning and functional analysis. in humans, kctd <dig> may be associated with obesity  <cit> , while csmd <dig> may be an oligodendroglioma suppressor  <cit> . therefore it is interesting to further study the mechanisms underlying the associations between polymorphisms in these two genes with growth traits in asian seabass.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a second generation genetic linkage map and carried out comparative mapping of synteny between asian seabass and t. nigroviridis. moreover, we applied this map for refinement of qtl for growth traits using extensive progeny testing with defined recombination within the qtl region. we estimated their locations within short intervals, identified potential candidate genes, and further defined the phenotypic consequences of alternative candidate gene alleles. this second generation linkage map should facilitate the advancement of genetic studies for a wide variety of complex traits in foodfish species. in the future, more snp markers should be identified by using next generation sequencing  <cit>  to enable whole genome association studies  <cit>  to facilitate genomic selection  <cit>  and to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic variation of important traits  <cit> .
