BACKGROUND
color vision is the ability to distinguish light of different wavelengths. this property has arisen independently in vertebrates and invertebrates through duplications of the genes encoding ciliary opsins and rhabdomeric opsins, respectively  <cit> . in the vertebrates, three types of cones displaying distinct wavelength properties were initially described by ragnar granit who received the nobel prize for these achievements in  <dig>  later studies, including molecular cloning of the visual opsins in various vertebrates, have shown that four major color opsin subtypes existed in early vertebrates  <cit> . thus, together with the dim-light  receptor rhodopsin expressed in rods, the family of visual opsins encompassed five members in early vertebrates: rh <dig> , rh <dig> , sws <dig> , sws <dig> , and lws .

subsequently, the gene repertoire has changed by gains and losses of opsin genes in the different vertebrate lineages. for instance, the ancestor of placental mammals lost rh <dig> and sws <dig> and extant mammals use sws <dig> for vision in the blue part of the spectrum. primates have a duplicate of lws that has mutated to have its absorption maximum in green, namely opn1mw. the platypus has retained sws <dig> but lost sws <dig>  other losses have occurred in frogs , in the coelacanth latimeria chalumnae, and in cartilaginous fishes. in teleost fishes, on the other hand, many additional duplicates have arisen  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of the five visual opsin sequences in chicken showed that the rhodopsin sequence rh <dig> was most closely related to the green opsin rh <dig>  suggesting that this gene duplication was the most recent and that the four color opsins existed before rhodopsin  <cit> . thus, it appeared that color vision was ancestral to the dim-light vision and the appearance of rhodopsin and rod photoreceptors facilitated the adaptation to nocturnal environments. as a rhodopsin sequence had already been described in a lamprey, this implied that all five opsins existed before the divergence of lampreys and gnathostomes, i.e., jawed vertebrates. subsequently, also the four color opsins have been described in pouched lamprey   <cit> .

although the visual opsin gene duplications must have taken place before the lamprey-gnathostome divergence, it has remained unclear how they happened. we and others have previously reported that numerous gene families expanded in the two genome doublings, i.e. tetraploidizations, that took place before the radiation of gnathostomes  <cit>  usually called 2r for two rounds of genome doubling. the two tetraploidizations resulted in a large number of quartets of related chromosome regions, and each such quartet is called a paralogon. subsequently, a third tetraploidization, 3r, took place in the lineage leading to teleost fishes  <cit> . by investigating gene families sharing chromosome regions, we have been able to deduce the evolution of multiple neuronal and endocrine gene families as well as their neighbors, namely the opioid peptides  <cit>  and receptors  <cit> , neuropeptide y-family peptides  <cit>  and receptors  <cit> , voltage-gated sodium channels and their neighboring tgf-β receptors  <cit> , the igfbp family  <cit> , the paralemmin family  <cit>  and, more recently, the three transducin subunit gene families activated by visual opsins  <cit> . all of these families received additional members in 2r and all but one expanded further in 3r. chromosomal positions thereby constitute a useful additional type of information for analyses of gene families, especially families that display different evolutionary rates among members or over time, both of which seem to afflict the visual opsins.

we have previously performed sequence-based phylogenetic analyses of several gene families in the phototransduction cascade, and also investigated their chromosomal positions in the human genome  <cit> . these analyses suggested that most of the phototransduction gene families expanded in the basal vertebrate tetraploidizations, including the visual opsin family. in our first study, we proposed that rh <dig>  sws <dig> and lws arose as a result of duplications of a large chromosome block  <cit> . because teleost fishes and birds have the lws and sws <dig> genes in close proximity on the same chromosome  <cit> , we suggested a scenario where two adjacent visual opsin genes were quadrupled by chromosome duplications  <cit> . however, the paralogon harboring the opsin genes seemed to have undergone major rearrangements and only a few adjacent gene families were identified, thereby making our conclusions uncertain. interestingly, one of the neighboring gene families was the transducin alpha subunit family , involved in the phototransduction cascade, as well as its adjacent relative g protein alpha inhibiting subunit  gene  <cit> . the gnat family includes three genes located on three of the visual opsin chromosomes in several vertebrates, each flanked by a more distantly related gnai gene  <cit> .

in parallel, independent analyses in our laboratory of the oxytocin/vasopressin receptor  genes and the l-type voltage-gated calcium channel alpha subunit  genes converged to reveal large chromosomal regions that share evolutionary history with the visual opsin, gnat and gnai genes. the pituitary peptide hormones oxytocin and vasopressin have previously been reported to have five to six ancestral vertebrate receptors  based on phylogenetic analyses  <cit> : one oxytocin receptor, otr, encoded by oxtr genes, and four to five vasopressin receptors, including v1a , v1b  as well as several types of v <dig> receptors. we report here that the ot/vp-r family genes are located in the proposed visual opsin paralogon, thus resolving the issue of the evolutionary relationships between the ancestral members. finally, the l-type voltage-gated calcium channel alpha subunits  form a family with four members whose genes are located on the visual opsin chromosomes.

we have used these gene families as starting points for extensive analyses of conserved synteny in species representing several vertebrate classes. we report here that these five main gene families and  <dig> neighboring gene families comprise large paralogous chromosomal regions with extensive similarities to one another that can most parsimoniously be explained by quadruplication of a large ancestral chromosome region. these results define the time points for expansion of the visual opsin family as well as the transducin alpha family, the oxytocin/vasopressin receptors, and the l-type voltage-gated calcium channels. furthermore, our results have implications for the divergence time point of lampreys and jawed vertebrates relative to the two basal vertebrate tetraploidizations.

RESULTS
we used amino acid sequences identified in genome databases to produce alignments and phylogenetic trees for the visual opsins, the oxytocin and vasopressin receptors , the g-protein alpha transducing  and inhibiting  subunits, as well as the l-type voltage-gated calcium channel alpha subunits . detailed information on these gene families, including database identifiers, location data, genome assembly information and annotation notes for all identified sequences, is provided in additional file  <dig>  topologies of the visual opsin and ot/vp-r gene family trees are presented in this section and we have recently published our phylogenetic analyses of the gnat and gnai gene families  <cit> . the phylogenetic analyses of the cacna1-l family, which have not been published previously, are included in additional file 2: figures s <dig> and s <dig>  these gene families have members located in overlapping regions of the human genome putatively considered as one paralogon and are henceforth referred to as the “main” gene families of this study.

we have also made phylogenetic trees for  <dig> neighboring gene families identified in the chromosomal regions of the main gene families. the positional data from the main gene families and the neighboring gene families have been compared between the genomes of human, chicken, zebrafish, three-spined stickleback and spotted gar. this combination of phylogenetic and synteny data is the basis for the description of our results below.

phylogenetic analyses of vertebrate visual opsin genes
genes for the five ancestral types of visual opsins present in the vertebrate ancestor   <cit>  were identified in sarcopterygians  and actinopterygians . these results are summarized in table  <dig>  in the phylogenetic analyses these sequences form five well-supported clusters: the lws cluster forms a basal separate branch while the sws <dig>  sws <dig>  rh <dig> and rh <dig> cluster together with high support . this topology is supported by neighbor joining  and phylogenetic maximum likelihood  methods . the trees were rooted with the human opn <dig> sequence, as the opn <dig> gene has been shown to diverge before the diversification of the visual opsin genes  <cit> . pinopsins and the vertebrate ancient  opsins often cluster with the visual opsins in phylogenetic analyses  <cit> , and there are also related opsins in the tunicate ciona intestinalis called ci-opsin <dig> and ci-opsin <dig> <cit> . the overall topology presented in figure  <dig> is not affected by the inclusion of these sequences in additional phylogenetic analyses . all opsin phylogenetic tree files and the alignments they were made from are provided as a citable file set with a stable identifier – see reference  <cit> .

visual opsin gene repertoires
the repertoires of visual opsins in mammals and birds have been described in detail in numerous previous studies, and the anole lizard  opsin genes have been described more recently  <cit> . these data are consistent with our analyses , which confirm that the ancestral repertoire in jawed vertebrates consisted of five visual opsin genes with losses of sws <dig> and rh <dig> in mammals. the western clawed frog  also seems to have lost the rh <dig> gene, although this could be due to gaps in the genome assembly. three full-length and one fragmented visual opsin gene sequences were identified in the coelacanth  genome assembly. the full-length sequences cluster within the rh <dig>  rh <dig> and sws <dig> branches . the rh <dig> and rh <dig> sequences have previously been reported  <cit> . the presence of only three visual opsin sequences indicates that there seem to have been losses of visual opsin genes in this lineage. the fragmented gene sequence appears to be a pseudogene sharing sequence similarity to known sws <dig> sequences, but with a premature stop-codon and a frame-shift mutation within the first exon. a sequence fragment bearing the same mutations at the same locations has been identified previously  <cit>  as one of two non-overlapping clones postulated to be parts of an sws <dig> pseudogene. however, the second clone reported by these authors, instead corresponds to a fragment of the full-length sws <dig> sequence that we identified. all five ancestral types of vertebrate visual opsin genes are present in all the investigated actinopterygian genomes , except the spotted green pufferfish, where an sws <dig> sequence could not be identified . additionally, lws, sws <dig>  rh <dig> and rh <dig> sequences often occur as multiple local duplicates in teleosts . in the spotted gar genome assembly we could identify seven visual opsin genes: one gene each of the lws, sws <dig> and rh <dig> types and two genes each of the sws <dig> and rh <dig> types . the two sws <dig> genes are located adjacent to each other on the same linkage group  approximately  <dig> kb apart , and are thus most likely the result of a local duplication. the two rh <dig> genes are located on the same linkage group  approximately  <dig>  mb apart, one with introns  and one without . these duplicate rh <dig> genes on the same chromosome have previously been identified in teleost fish species: the one with introns, called exo-rhodopsin, is expressed outside of the retina; and the one without introns, called rhodopsin, is expressed in rods  <cit> . the intron-less rhodopsin gene is the result of a retrotranscription event  <cit> . we could identify these duplicate rh <dig> sequences in all investigated teleost genomes . additionally, the zebrafish has two copies of the intron-less rhodopsin gene, located on two different chromosomes. these zebrafish genes have previously been called rh <dig> and rh1- <dig> <cit>  or rho and rhol  . the teleost exo-rhodopsins form a well-supported cluster in the phylogenetic analyses  while the putative spotted gar exo-rhodopsin  has an uncertain position within the rh <dig> cluster. on the other hand, the rhodopsin gene of the spotted gar clusters together with the teleost rhodopsin genes with high support, forming a well-defined actinopterygian cluster .

five visual opsins have previously been cloned and characterized from the pouched lamprey   <cit>  and were therefore included in our phylogenetic analyses to provide relative dating. in line with previous analyses  <cit>  the pouched lamprey lws, sws <dig> and sws <dig> sequences cluster with high support within their respective branches . we also find that the sequences called rha and rhb represent the rh <dig> and rh <dig> genes, with high support in all our phylogenetic analyses . thus it is likely that all five visual opsin genes were present before the divergence of cyclostomes, such as the lampreys, and jawed vertebrates.

phylogenetic analysis of the oxytocin and vasopressin receptor genes
we have updated recent phylogenetic analyses of the ot/vp-r gene family  <cit>  by including sequences from the coelacanth, spotted gar and southern platyfish. this was done in order to improve the taxonomic representation and complement our conserved synteny analysis, which includes positional data from the spotted gar genome assembly. both nj and phyml trees were made , and the phyml tree is shown in figure  <dig>  our updated phylogenetic analyses are consistent with the previously cited literature, but also show several new results.

the clusters for oxytocin receptors  and v1-type vasopressin receptors  are well-supported, and the tree shows that the spotted gar, like teleosts, lacks the v1b subtype while the coelacanth has all three . with regard to v2-type vasopressin receptors, yamaguchi et al  were able to define three types by using synteny data  <cit> . our phylogenetic analyses and the analysis of conserved synteny described below are consistent with three ancestral v2-types, and we propose the nomenclature v2a, v2b and v2c for these receptors. as in the previously cited analyses, the v2c receptors form two paraphyletic branches, with teleost v2c sequences clustering basal to the other v2-type branches , likely due to a faster rate of sequence evolution. however, their chromosomal locations support their orthology with tetrapod and spotted gar v2c sequences . the coelacanth lacks a v2c sequence but has both v2a and v2b, making it the only analyzed species in the sarcopterygian lineage  with a v2b gene. since v2c sequences were found in the western clawed frog, anole lizard and chicken genomes , the loss in the coelacanth is likely lineage-specific. taken together with the spotted gar, which has all three v2-type sequences , this indicates that the v2a, v2b and v2c subtypes arose early in vertebrate evolution, although there have been several differential losses in different vertebrate classes. sequences from the southern platyfish were included since this species was found to have the v2c sequence that previously had only been found in zebrafish and three-spined stickleback  <cit> . these three species do not form a monophyletic group within teleosts, which indicates that v2c genes could have been lost several times in teleost evolution. the southern platyfish is also the only teleost where duplicate v2b sequences were found .

database identifiers, location data, genome assembly information, and annotation notes for all identified ot/vp-r sequences are included in additional file  <dig>  the ot/vp-r phylogenetic tree files and the alignment they were made from are provided as a citable file set with a stable identifier – see reference  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of the l-type voltage-gated calcium channel alpha subunits
four genes of the cacna1-l family were identified in the tetrapod genomes investigated: cacna1d, cacna1f, cacna1c and cacna1s. however cacna1f could not be identified in the chicken genome assembly or in any other avian genome available. the western clawed frog was excluded from the analysis because the short scaffolds of the genome assembly  did not allow complete gene sequences to be identified. in the teleost genomes investigated all four genes are present, with additional putative 3r duplicates of the cacna1d, -1f and -1s genes in all four teleost genomes. these results are detailed in additional file  <dig>  with database identifiers, location data, genome assembly information, and annotation notes for all identified sequences.

the cacna1f, -1c and -1s genes form three distinct clusters in the bootstrapped nj  and phyml  analyses, while the putative teleost cacna1d subtype cluster is only resolved in the nj tree . these results are presented in additional file  <dig>  all cacna1-l phylogenetic tree files and the alignment they were made from are provided as a citable file set with a stable identifier – see reference  <cit> .

conserved synteny analysis
in total,  <dig> neighboring gene families showed patterns of conserved synteny in the chromosomal regions harboring members of the five main gene families. seven of the  <dig> gene families were discarded upon preliminary analyses because their multitude of members in the genome databases made phylogenetic analyses unreliable, or because their topologies could not be resolved, leaving  <dig> gene families in our final dataset. these families are summarized in table  <dig>  the locations of the identified genes were recorded for  <dig> species, representing five of the vertebrate classes, with available genome assemblies , and phylogenetic analyses using neighbor joining  and phylogenetic maximum likelihood  methods were carried out for each gene family in order to determine orthology and paralogy relationships. database identifiers, location data and annotation notes for the neighboring gene families, including those that were discarded, are provided in additional file  <dig> and all corresponding alignments and phylogenetic trees are provided as a citable file set with a stable identifier – see reference  <cit> .

 <dig> if other than drosophila melanogaster.

for the majority of the identified neighboring gene families,  <dig> out of  <dig>  both the nj trees and the phyml trees support duplications in the same time-window as the 2r events, i.e. after the divergence of invertebrate chordates and vertebrates, but before the divergence of sarcopterygians and actinopterygians. several of the  <dig> identified families also have duplicate teleost branches supporting duplications in the same time-window as the teleost-specific 3r event. four additional gene families are consistent with duplications in 2r, but lack invertebrate family members to date the duplications. the remaining seven gene families have some subtype clusters that are unresolved, or an unresolved branching of the identified tunicate or lancelet sequences, which makes them inconclusive with regard to the duplications in 2r. detailed notes on the tree topologies for the neighboring gene families are provided in additional file  <dig> 

to investigate the involvement of the whole genome duplications, the chromosomal locations of all neighboring family members were recorded and compared across species. a compiled list of comparisons between the human, chicken, zebrafish and three-spined stickleback chromosome regions is shown in additional file  <dig>  this dataset shows the conserved synteny between the visual opsin gene-bearing chromosome regions in the analyzed genomes, which also includes the ot/vp-r, cacna1-l and gnat/gnai gene families. these paralogous chromosome regions correspond to blocks present on human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x, and chicken chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the blocks on human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> seem to be the result of a linkage break in the human lineage, since the chicken orthologs of the genes in both of these blocks are all located on chicken chromosome  <dig>  this is supported by our orthology analysis of the spotted gar genome . notably, no chicken orthologs of the genes located on the human x chromosome were found in the chicken genome database, indicating that this whole segment of the chicken genome is missing from the genome assembly .

the teleost-specific duplication of whole chromosome regions is evident in the teleost genomes for the regions harboring opn1sw, v1a, cacna1c and gnai <dig> genes . these regions of chicken chromosome  <dig> and human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to blocks on zebrafish chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> , and three-spined stickleback linkage groups iv and xix , with several of the gene families having teleost-specific duplicates in both chromosome blocks. however, our analyses also demonstrate that there have been extensive rearrangements in the teleost genomes, which obscure the involvement of both the 2r and 3r events. for instance, genes located on the chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and the x chromosome in the human genome have orthologs distributed between zebrafish chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in a way that suggests translocation of paralogous genes between these chromosome regions after 3r .

in order to date the translocations seen in the teleost genomes better, orthology predictions between the human neighboring family members and the spotted gar genome were made . the locations of the predicted spotted gar orthologs were then recorded and compared with the human, chicken, zebrafish and three-spined stickleback chromosome regions . while only around 75% of putative spotted gar orthologs could be found for the human neighboring gene family members, this analysis of conserved synteny between the human and spotted gar shows no translocations in the spotted gar genome. with a few exceptions, the identified putative spotted gar orthologs are located on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which correspond to the regions on human chromosomes x,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and linkage group  <dig> which corresponds to the regions on human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> .

discussion
in order to investigate the evolution of the visual opsin genes related to the two rounds of early vertebrate whole genome duplications, 2r, we have analyzed several neighboring gene families identified in the same chromosomal regions as the human visual opsin genes. specifically, we investigated whether there were other gene families showing conserved synteny with these and whether they underwent gene duplications in the same time-window as the 2r events. during the process of these analyses we realized that the chromosomal regions of the visual opsin genes overlapped with similar ongoing analyses in our laboratory of the oxytocin and vasopressin receptor gene family , the g-protein alpha transducing subunit  and g-protein alpha inhibiting subunit  gene families, as well as the gene family of l-type voltage-gated calcium channel alpha subunits . these gene families are referred to as the “main” gene families in our analyses. their evolution will be discussed below in conjunction with the evolution of the visual opsins.

the chromosomal regions harboring the visual opsin genes were duplicated in the vertebrate whole genome duplications
in total, the chromosomal locations and phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> neighboring gene families have been analyzed. the orthology and paralogy relationships within each family were inferred and, using relative dating, the time-window for the expansion of the gene families was determined. the synteny data and phylogenetic analyses taken together show that the chromosome regions bearing the visual opsin genes are paralogous and were formed by chromosome duplications in the same time-window as the 2r events, after the divergence of invertebrate chordates and before the divergence of actinopterygians  and sarcopterygians . our analyses also show that the chromosomal regions were duplicated once more in early teleost evolution, consistent with the time-window of the 3r event. our proposed evolutionary scenario for the evolution of these chromosome regions is presented in figure  <dig>  in the human genome, the paralogous chromosomal regions correspond to blocks of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x , with the blocks on  <dig> and  <dig> together representing one of the four ancestral blocks. these genomic regions have previously been identified as part of a paralogon in large-scale genomic analyses  <cit> .

chromosomal rearrangements in teleost genomes, but not in the spotted gar genome
in the teleost genomes the investigated orthologous genes of the human genes located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and x seem to have been rearranged so that the genes are intermingled. in zebrafish this involves chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and in the three-spined stickleback linkage groups xii, xvii and scaffold  <dig> . these major rearrangements are in line with previous whole genome analyses  <cit> . recently amores et al. published an analysis of the genome of the spotted gar , which belongs to a actinopterygian lineage that diverged before 3r and thus should not have the same rearrangements  <cit> . they found that the spotted gar seemed to have fewer rearrangements in general compared to the teleosts and that the synteny was more conserved between human and spotted gar than between spotted gar and zebrafish due to post-3r rearrangements in the teleost lineage. to see if this was the case for the regions housing the visual opsin genes, we performed an orthology prediction between human and spotted gar protein predictions and recorded the chromosomal locations of the putative spotted gar orthologs . this is summarized in figure  <dig>  by comparing the chromosomal regions of human, chicken, spotted gar, zebrafish and three-spined stickleback we found that the synteny is indeed more conserved between human, chicken and spotted gar than between spotted gar and the teleosts, in agreement with the global genome analyses  <cit> . this further supports the notion that 3r contributed to the major rearrangements seen in teleost genomes  <cit> .

evolution of the visual opsin gene family
our phylogenetic analyses and the analyses of conserved synteny of the visual opsins and their chromosomal regions support the evolutionary scenario previously proposed by us  <cit>  where a local duplication occurred before 2r giving rise to two ancestral genes, sws and lws. these genes later duplicated in 2r as part of a larger chromosomal block so that the ancestral sws gene gave rise to the types sws <dig>  sws <dig>  rh <dig> and rh <dig> and the ancestral lws gave rise to four copies out of which only one has been retained, namely the lws type . although the pinopsins and vertebrate ancient  opsins cluster with the visual opsins in phylogenetic trees , the present synteny analysis does not indicate that pinopsins and v/a opsins arose in the same chromosome duplications that gave rise to the visual opsin gene family. the current repertoire of visual opsin genes in vertebrates, and their evolution, is summarized in figure  <dig> 

five of the seven identified spotted gar genes represent the lws, sws <dig>  sws <dig> and rh <dig> types of visual opsin genes, while the other two represent the rh <dig> type : one intron-containing  and one intron-less . the intron-containing rh <dig> gene is likely the ortholog of the teleost exo-rhodopsin gene , named for its expression mainly in the pineal complex of the teleost brain instead of the retina  <cit> . the intron-less rh <dig> gene is likely the ortholog of the teleost rhodopsin  gene, a retrotranscript of the exo-rhodopsin gene  <cit> . our analyses indicate that the retrotransposition event occurred before the divergence of holostean fishes  and teleosts . the intron-less spotted gar rh <dig> is presumably the ortholog of a gene that has previously been identified in the longnose gar  as rhodopsin  <cit> . in the zebrafish there is an additional intron-less rh <dig> gene called rhol for rhodopsin-like , located on a different chromosome than the rho gene . morrow et al., who identified the two intronless rh <dig> genes in the zebrafish genome, also identified similar duplicated genes in a few other cyprinid species  <cit> . analyses performed by other researchers have shown that duplicated intron-less rh <dig> genes seem to be present in some non-cyprinid teleost species as well, including the deep-sea dwelling short-fin pearl-eye  <cit>  and the japanese and european eels  <cit> . this suggests that the two intron-less rh <dig> genes might have originated in 3r, following the retrotransposition event. however, to confirm that rho and rhol are 3r duplicates, information about chromosomal locations is needed from several species. the presence of two intronless rh <dig> genes in the above-mentioned species, but not in the medaka, spotted green pufferfish and three-spined stickleback, suggests loss in the latter species or in their common ancestor. in the zebrafish, the regions harbouring the duplicated rh <dig> genes rho and rhol on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> have undergone major rearrangements. our analyses show that these chromosomes contain paralogous members of the cacna1-l, erc, cacna2d, prickle and magi families . the cacna2d and magi tree topologies support a 3r duplication of these paralogous gene copies. however, the paralogous copies in the trees of the cacna1-l, erc and prickle families are inconsistent. while it is a likely scenario, we cannot say for certain that the duplicate intron-less rh <dig> genes originated in 3r.

evolution of the gnat and gnai gene families
in our previous analyses of the gnat gene family we concluded that the gnat-gnai gene pairs seen today in many vertebrates had an origin in a local duplication preceding 2r. the 2r events subsequently gave rise to the gnat1-gnai <dig>  gnat2-gnai <dig> and gnat3-gnai <dig> gene pairs  <cit> . this is in line with previous studies from other research groups, see for instance  <cit> . consequently, independent losses of the gnat <dig> gene have occurred in the teleost and amphibian lineages and possibly the sea lamprey  lineage after 2r  <cit> . we identified putative 3r duplicates in the gnai gene family for the gnai <dig> and gnai <dig> genes in our previous analysis  <cit> , although we had no synteny data to support the hypothesis. in the present analyses  <dig> gene families have putative 3r duplicates located on the gnai1-bearing chromosomes in zebrafish . six of these families show a clear 3r topology in both phylogenetic analyses. in the three-spined stickleback  <dig> neighboring gene families have members on the gnai1-bearing chromosomes , seven of which show a clear 3r topology in both phylogenetic analyses. in addition, three of the  <dig> families in zebrafish as well as three out of  <dig> families in three-spined stickleback show a topology supporting 3r in either the nj or phyml tree. for the gnai <dig> genes, four neighboring gene families have putative 3r duplicates on the gnai <dig> bearing chromosomes in zebrafish . three of these show a clear 3r duplication pattern. in three-spined stickleback only one family has members on the gnai <dig> bearing chromosome and scaffold , although its topology is unclear with regard to 3r. these results are summarized in additional file  <dig>  our orthology predictions between human and spotted gar identified a single putative gnat <dig> ortholog as well as a single putative gnai1- <dig> ortholog . taken together this analysis supports a possible 3r expansion of the gnai <dig> and gnai <dig> genes and their chromosomal regions. this also corroborates the loss of the gnat <dig> gene in the teleost and amphibian lineages independently.

evolution of the oxytocin and vasopressin receptor gene family
our phylogenetic analysis of the ot/vp-r family  shows that the vertebrate gene family consists of six ancestral members, otr, v1a, v1b, v2a, v2b and v2c. we propose a simplified nomenclature for the v2-type receptors based on the evolutionary scenario below. the v2a receptors form the largest branch and include the well-characterized mammalian v <dig> receptor encoded by the avpr <dig> gene. the v2b receptor subtype was identified independently by us  <cit>  and other researchers  <cit> , and includes mostly actinopterygian sequences as well as coelacanth and elephant shark. the v2c receptor subtype was first reported by us as v2-like in zebrafish and three-spined stickleback  <cit> , and it was later characterized as v2br <dig> by yamaguchi et al. <cit> . unlike v2b, the v2c branch includes frog and lizard sequences, as well as the known chicken v <dig> receptor first characterized as vt <dig>  <cit> . like the receptors otr, v1a and v1b, both v2b and v2c seem to signal via the dag/ip3/ca2+ pathway, while the adenylyl cyclase/pka/camp signaling typical for v2a receptors seems to constitute an evolutionary switch in the ot/vp-r family  <cit> .

our current phylogenetic analysis and the analyses of the visual opsin gene-bearing chromosome regions allowed us to deduce the following evolutionary scenario for the ot/vp-r gene family: two ancestral genes were present on the same ancestral vertebrate chromosome before 2r, one giving rise to v1a, v1b and otr through 2r and one giving rise to v2a, v2b and v2c . the ancestral linkage is still conserved with v2b and otr genes located together, and v1a and v2c genes located together on the same chromosomes. in the teleost lineage, the 3r event gave rise to two copies of v1a, called v1aa and v1ab, as part of the same chromosome regions as the teleost gnai <dig> genes . the phylogenetic analysis  is consistent with this, although the v1aa and v1ab sequences do not form two well-supported clusters. in the teleosts we also identified local duplicates of otr, called otr <dig> and otr <dig>  and of v2a, called v2a <dig> and v2a <dig> 

evolution of the voltage-gated calcium channel, l-type gene family
the cacna1-l gene family is one of three subfamilies of voltage-gated calcium channel alpha subunits. the cacna1-l subfamily, which belongs to the paralogon described herein, has four members in mammals and up to seven members in teleost fish. a more comprehensive analysis of this gene region and the remaining two voltage-gated calcium channel families, located in other paralogons, is in progress .

the phylogenetic analyses  as well as the analyses of conserved synteny performed in this study show that the cacna1-l gene family expanded in 2r, before the radiation of vertebrates, with one ancestral gene giving rise to the cacna1s, cacna1d, cacna1c and cacna1f subtype genes. subsequently the cacna1s, -1d and -1f genes duplicated in 3r as part of the visual opsin gene-housing chromosome regions . as for several other gene families in this paralogon, these teleost duplicates have been translocated between the paralogous chromosome regions. for instance, teleost cacna1s, cacna1d and cacna1f genes have all been translocated to zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  and stickleback linkage group xii . as mentioned previously, we have observed similar rearrangements for other regions in teleost genomes during analyses of the somatostatin receptor gene regions  <cit> . the cacna1d teleost cluster is not well resolved in the phylogenetic maximum likelihood analysis , and no putative spotted gar sequence could be identified in the orthology predictions. however, our conserved synteny analyses as well as previous whole-genome analyses  <cit>  are consistent with our conclusions.

implications for early vertebrate radiation
our analyses show that the gnathostome opsin repertoire with the four subtypes rh <dig>  rh <dig>  sws <dig>  sws <dig> clearly resulted from a quadruplication of an ancestral chromosome block . the presence of orthologs of all these genes in the pouched lamprey   <cit>  imply that these chromosome-based gene duplications took place before the lamprey-gnathostome divergence, as previously proposed  <cit> . our present extensive characterization of these paralogous gene regions in a broad range of vertebrates demonstrates that they resulted from the quadruplication of a very large chromosomal block in the time window of 2r. thus, it would follow that the lamprey lineage diverged after the two basal vertebrate tetraploidizations. if hagfishes and lampreys together form a monophyletic clade in the superclass cyclostomata, as seems to be the case  <cit> , this would mean that all vertebrates, including hagfish  <cit> , share a common ancestor that had gone through 2r. to our knowledge, the opsin gene family is presently the only one that has been found to have retained a complete 2r quartet in a lamprey. several previously investigated gene families in the literature display fewer family members in lampreys than in gnathostomes – see for instance  <cit> , suggesting more extensive gene loss in the lamprey lineage after 2r. nevertheless, some incomplete gene families are consistent with post-2r divergence of cyclostomes and jawed vertebrates, including the retinoic acid receptors rar  <cit> . the genome-wide duplication pattern in the recently published sea lamprey  whole-genome sequence was found to be indicative of 2r  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we present an extensive analysis of the paralogous chromosome regions housing the gene families for visual opsins, the g-protein alpha subunit families for transducin  and adenylyl cyclase inhibition , the oxytocin and vasopressin receptors , and the l-type voltage-gated calcium channel alpha subunits , using both phylogenetic analyses and positional data for these as well as  <dig> chromosomal neighboring gene families. this combined dataset makes it possible to make a robust inference how this region evolved. we conclude that these related chromosome regions originated from an ancestral chromosome that was duplicated in the two basal vertebrate tetraploidizations  resulting in four paralogous chromosome regions. the paralogon was duplicated again in the teleost-specific tetraploidization  giving teleost fish additional gene family members. we could detect extensive post-3r chromosomal rearrangements between the paralogous chromosome regions in teleost genomes that obscure the view of these whole genome duplications, as noted previously  <cit> . however, the analyses of extant teleost genomes combined with the data presented here from the spotted gar, an out-group to teleost evolution, allowed us to resolve the rearrangements.

referring also to our previous analyses of several gene families, we conclude that the basal vertebrate tetraploidizations contributed with new genetic material in several gene families involved in the phototransduction cascade, but also in other functions related to the vertebrate nervous system.
