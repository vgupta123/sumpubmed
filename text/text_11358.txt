BACKGROUND
oropharyngeal candidiasis  is the most frequent opportunistic fungal infection encountered in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus   <cit> . although highly active antiretroviral therapy has sharply reduced the incidence of opc in developed countries  <cit> , it remains a common co-infection in many developing regions where people living with hiv/aids have limited access to therapy  <cit> . the critical impairments of mucosal immunity which cause susceptibility to opc in hiv-infection are only partly understood  <cit> . a correlation has been established in hiv infection between symptomatic opc and reduced cd4+ cell count  <cit> , hiv viral load  <cit> , and the development of aids  <cit> . moreover, a dominant role for il-17-producing th <dig> cells in host defense against opc was demonstrated by conti et al.  <cit> , who found that candida infection of the tongue was less severe in mice lacking il-12p <dig> than in mice lacking il-23p <dig>  the latter also displaying impaired neutrophil recruitment to the mucosa. conti et al.  <cit>  also reported defective mucosal expression of murine β-defensin  <dig>  s100a <dig> and ccl <dig> in il-17rako mice. furthermore, th <dig> signature genes are induced early after oral c. albicans infection of immunocompetent mice  <cit> . in addition to il- <dig>  il- <dig> production by th <dig> cells also contributes to early host defense against c. albicans  <cit> , and il- <dig> and il- <dig> cooperatively enhance expression of antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes  <cit> . induction of this protective th <dig> response is dependent on recognition of c. albicans by the mannose receptor  <cit> , and dectin- <dig> and - <dig> signaling through the syk/card <dig> cascade  <cit> , leading to il- <dig> but not il- <dig> production by antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . in normal humans, memory cd4+ t-cells specific for c. albicans reside mainly in the th <dig> subset  <cit> .

it is now well established that ccr6+ th <dig> cells, including those specific to c. albicans, are highly permissive to hiv- <dig> infection in vitro and are preferentially depleted in peripheral blood of hiv-infected patients  <cit> . evidence has also been presented showing that th <dig> cells are depleted in the gastrointestinal mucosa of persons infected with hiv  <cit> . there has been much speculation about defective th <dig> responses to oral c. albicans infection in the context of hiv infection  <cit> , which would result in a lack of the critical cytokines required to up-regulate the innate mucosal response, and consequently cause susceptibility to opc  <cit> . however, no experimental evidence has as yet been presented to support this hypothesis.

using a model of oral candida infection in transgenic  mice expressing hiv- <dig> in cd4+ t-cells, dendritic cells  and macrophages, which closely mimics the clinical and pathological features of candidal infection in human hiv infection  <cit> , we have previously shown that altered cd4+ t-cell phenotype and function determine susceptibility to chronic carriage of c. albicans in these tg mice  <cit> . furthermore, dcs from these tg mice display an immature phenotype and defective antigen presentation  <cit> . in the present study, we asked whether cd4c/hivmuta tg mice have a defective capacity to induce protective th17-dependent mucosal responses to oral infection with c. albicans. here we show that depletion of the differentiated th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig>  th1th <dig> and treg cd4+ t-cell lineages in these tg mice results from depletion of naïve cd4+ t-cell precursors, and not from an inability of naïve cd4+ cells to differentiate in response to polarizing cytokines in vitro. we further demonstrate that tg mice are unable to up-regulate expression of the il <dig>  il <dig>  s100a <dig> and ccl <dig> genes in oral mucosal tissue in response to oral c. albicans infection, and that combined treatment of infected tg mice with il- <dig> and il- <dig> restores the ability of the tg mice to up-regulate expression of s100a <dig> and ccl <dig> and reduces oral burdens of c. albicans. defective il-17- and il-22-dependent induction of innate mucosal immunity to c. albicans is therefore central to the phenotype of susceptibility to opc in these hiv transgenic mice.

RESULTS
cd4+ t-cell subsets are all profoundly depleted in cd4c/hivmuta tg mice
phenotyping of cervical lymph node  cd4+ t-cells, harvested ex vivo from tg mice  <dig> or 70 days after infection or not with c. albicans, revealed significantly enhanced percentages of th <dig>  th1th <dig> and treg subsets but strikingly depleted absolute numbers of th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig>  th1th <dig> and treg cell populations compared to non-tg mice . furthermore, a significant expansion in absolute numbers of the th <dig> subset observed in non-tg mice 7 days after infection with c. albicans was absent in the tg mice . interestingly, mean surface expression of ccr <dig> by th <dig> cells  was not significantly altered  by hiv- <dig> transgene expression, indicating that this determinant of th <dig> cell migration was preserved in the tg mice.figure  <dig>

polarization of cd4+ t-cells and production of cytokines in vitro
to determine if expression of the hiv- <dig> transgene alters the differentiation of naive cd4+ t-cells into specific subsets, we next assessed expression of signature cd4+ t-cell subset genes and production of cytokines after differentiation of naive splenic cells in vitro. numbers of naïve cd4+ t-cells recovered per spleen were sharply diminished in tg compared to non-tg mice , consistent with previous findings in clns of tg mice  <cit> . the predicted up- or down-regulation of signature gene expression  <cit>  was found after incubation of naive cells from both non-tg and tg mice with cocktails of differentiating cytokines and blocking antibodies specific to the th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg subsets . however, hiv- <dig> transgene expression nevertheless altered gene expression profiles of the polarized subsets . compared to non-transgenic controls, polarized th <dig> cells from cd4c/hivmuta tg mice displayed increased expression of ahr, il <dig> and foxp <dig>  and polarized treg cells had enhanced expression of ahr and il17a , suggesting that expression of the hiv- <dig> transgene in cd4+ t-cells may produce an intermediate th17-treg phenotype under these differentiating conditions. although gata <dig> expression was lower in differentiated th <dig> cells from tg mice , the most relevant finding was that expression of this th <dig> signature gene was unaffected by transgene expression in th <dig> differentiating conditions . these findings demonstrate that naïve cd4+ cells from tg mice maintain the overall capacity to differentiate into specific subsets in vitro. furthermore, hiv- <dig> transgene expression did not significantly alter cytokine production in supernatants of cells differentiated or not into specific subsets  . production of ifn-γ and il-17a by naive cd4+ cells from tg and non-tg mice increased comparably in response to th <dig> and th <dig> differentiating conditions . therefore, using identical numbers of naïve cd4+ t-cells from tg and non-tg mice, in vitro differentiated cd4+ t-cell lineages from tg mice maintained their capacity to produce the critical cytokines required for a protective adaptive immune response to c. albicans.figure  <dig>

il- <dig> and il- <dig> treatment augments resistance to oral candidiasis and oral mucosal expression of calprotectin in cd4c/hivmuta tg mice
oral burdens of c. albicans were significantly increased  in tg compared to non-tg mice on days 3- <dig> after inoculation, as reported previously  <cit> , and treatment of the tg mice with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig> reduced oral burdens on days 5- <dig> compared to untreated tg controls . nevertheless, on days 3- <dig> after inoculation, oral burdens of c. albicans in tg mice treated with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig> remained significantly greater  than in untreated control non-tg mice, showing that this cytokine treatment did not fully restore resistance to oral candidiasis. interestingly, treatment with il- <dig> alone only produced a transient reduction  of oral burdens on day  <dig> , while il- <dig> alone was without significant effect  , showing that il- <dig> and il- <dig> are both required and non-redundant for mucosal host defense against c. albicans.figure  <dig>

histopathology of tongues of untreated control tg mice, conducted 7 days after oral inoculation of c. albicans, showed the expected dense hyphal penetration of the epithelium of the entire dorsum of the tongue, accompanied by occasional inflammatory cell infiltrates  <cit>  . in contrast, in tg mice treated with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the density of candida hyphae was sharply diminished, and, in most of the epithelium, hyphae were entirely absent . compared to untreated tg controls , this cytokine treatment did not induce an additional influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes  or other inflammatory cells to the epithelium of these tg mice at this time point of infection . in the control non-tg mice, which at day  <dig> are resolving primary candida infection   <cit> , only one or two small foci of candida hyphae were found in the keratinized layer of the epithelium of three of the six mice examined, with an underlying epithelial inflammatory infiltrate composed of pmns . uninfected non-tg and tg mice showed an absence of candida hyphae and inflammatory cell response .figure  <dig>

compared to uninfected controls at day  <dig>  infection of non-tg mice with c. albicans significantly  enhanced tongue tissue expression of s100a <dig>  ccl <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig> and, to a lesser degree, of the dfb <dig> gene . in striking contrast, the heightened expression of these genes in response to candida infection was completely abrogated in untreated control tg mice, with the exception of defb <dig> which showed a modest increase  comparable to that of the infected non-tg mice  . consistent with the reduced oral burdens of c. albicans, combined treatment with il- <dig> and il- <dig> restored the ability of the tg mice to up-regulate expression of s100a <dig>  ccl <dig> and il <dig> in response to c. albicans infection, to a level not significantly different from infected non-tg mice  . expression of ccl <dig> was unaffected by transgene expression, candida infection or cytokine treatment at this time point after oral inoculation.figure  <dig>

discussion
discovery of the critical role of th <dig> cell-dependent mucosal host responses in protection against oral candidiasis  <cit> , and the depletion of this cell population in hiv-infected patients  <cit> , have together suggested that defective th17-dependent responses to c. albicans determine susceptibility to opc in the setting of hiv infection  <cit> . however, direct experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis has been lacking. taking advantage of a model of oral candidiasis in transgenic mice expressing hiv- <dig>  <cit> , which display an aids-like disease  <cit> , we here show that defective il-17- and il-22-dependent induction of oral antimicrobial peptide expression in response to c. albicans infection is indeed central to the phenotype of susceptibility to opc in these hiv-transgenic mice.

in previous work, we found that cd4+ t-cells are depleted in the oral mucosa, clns and peripheral blood of cd4c/hivmuta tg mice, that cd4+ cells harvested from tg mice 7 days after infection fail to proliferate and to acquire an effector phenotype in response to c. albicans antigen in vitro, and that transfer of cd4+ t-cells from uninfected non-tg mice into infected tg mice restores cell proliferation and sharply reduces oral burdens of c. albicans  <cit> . the present data show that naïve cd4+ t-cells and the polarized subsets, including th <dig> cells, are all depleted in these tg mice and together contribute to the observed diminution of total cd4+ t-cells. mechanistically, cd4+ cell depletion in these tg mice has been shown to result from impaired selection and lineage commitment of cd4+ single-positive thymocytes  <cit> , and an activated memory-like phenotype that exhausts the t-cell pool  <cit> . consistent with our previous observations 7 days after infection with c. albicans  <cit> , absolute numbers of cd4+ t-cells were augmented in the clns of non-tg, but not of tg mice, at this time point. although absolute numbers of the th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and th1th <dig> subsets were all increased in clns of infected non-tg mice compared to uninfected controls, this increase only reached statistical significance for the th <dig> subset. nevertheless, these aggregate results indicate that c. albicans infection induces a broad expansion of cd4+ cell subsets in control non-tg mice, that is abrogated in infected tg mice.

although depleted in absolute numbers, the proportion of tregs relative to total cd4+ cells was enhanced in tg compared to non-tg mice. this treg enrichment is the direct result of hiv- <dig> nef expression in cd4+ t-cells, occurs independently of nef-induced lymphopenia, and involves multiple mechanisms: lower apoptosis, enhanced cell division, and increased generation from precursors  <cit> . consistent with our findings, studies in hiv-infected patients have also reported a relative increase in frequency but reduced absolute numbers of tregs  <cit> . in addition, the late depletion of tregs in clns of the tg mice, at  <dig> but not 7 days, concurs with the preserved numbers of tregs in lymph nodes during acute siv infection  <cit> .

having established that the th <dig> and other cd4+ cell subsets are depleted in the tg mice, we next showed that this depletion does not result from an inability of naïve cd4+ cells from tg mice to differentiate into the expected cd4 + cell subsets when incubated with polarizing cytokines in vitro. therefore, the depletion of polarized cd4+ t-cell subsets is most likely caused by the marked diminution of naïve cd4+ cells which we found in the tg mice, rather than any potential downstream defects in cd4+ cell differentiation. naïve cd4+ t-cells are also depleted in human hiv infection  <cit> .

in vitro differentiation of naïve cd4+ t-cells from control non-tg mice induced expression of the expected subset-specific signature genes. the enhanced expression of il <dig> by cells from tg and non-tg mice under th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> polarizing conditions confirms that this cytokine can be produced not only by th <dig> cells but also by other subsets including th <dig> and th <dig> cells  <cit> . although hiv- <dig> transgene expression did not inhibit subset polarization and expression of the expected signature genes, it nevertheless altered gene expression profiles of cells incubated in the presence of differentiating cytokines. in cells from the tg mice, induction of ahr in th <dig> and treg differentiation conditions is consistent with the known activation of the nf-κb pathway by the hiv nef protein  <cit> , which in turn enhances ahr expression  <cit> . for their part, naïve cd4+ cells from non-tg mice, polarized under th <dig> conditions, displayed significantly lower expression of foxp <dig> compared to cells from tg mice. because naïve cd4+ cells were polarized in vitro without apcs, it is unlikely that the enhanced foxp <dig> expression in th17-polarized cells from tg mice, compared to non-tg animals, resulted from induction of ido by hiv- <dig> nef. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that prior in vivo exposure of naïve cells to increased ido activity, before harvesting from the tg mice, may have sufficed to alter the balance of th <dig> and treg signature genes in vitro. interestingly, foxp <dig> expression is increased in gut-associated lymphoid tissue of untreated hiv-infected patients  <cit> .

despite these alterations in gene expression induced by the hiv- <dig> transgene, it is noteworthy that cytokine production in supernatants of in vitro differentiated cd4+ cell subsets was nevertheless comparable in tg and non-tg mice. accordingly, the differentiated cd4+ cell subsets maintained this critical functional capacity despite hiv- <dig> transgene expression. of direct relevance to host defense against c. albicans, production of il- <dig> under th <dig> differentiation conditions in vitro was unaffected by transgene expression.

consistent with previous studies conducted in immunocompetent mice  <cit> , oral infection with c. albicans induced expression of s100a <dig>  ccl <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> in tongue tissues of the non-tg mice. however, this mucosal immune response to c. albicans infection was completely abrogated in the tg mice. treatment of infected tg mice with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig> by the intraperitoneal route every 2 days for 14 days significantly reduced oral burdens of c. albicans, markedly decreased the density of c. albicans on histopathology of the oral epithelium, and restored the expression of s100a <dig> and ccl <dig>  the cytokine dosage of 3 μg was selected because it is at the upper end of the range of dosages  previously administered to mice by the intraperitoneal route without undesirable effects  <cit> . because this combined cytokine treatment did not fully reduce oral burdens of c. albicans to levels in the non-tg mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that a further reduction may be achievable with daily treatment, or by increasing the cytokine dosage to the maximum tolerated dose, to be determined by dose-ranging studies. alternately, the defects of mucosal immunity which cause susceptibility to opc in the tg mice could partially involve th <dig> effector mechanisms  <cit>  which are il-17- and il-22-independent. the requirement for combined treatment with both il- <dig> and il- <dig> to restore mucosal immunity to c. albicans extends in vitro studies which showed that il- <dig> in conjunction with il- <dig> additively enhance the expression of s100a <dig> by keratinocytes  <cit> . the mechanism of this cooperation between il- <dig> and il- <dig> for induction of antimicrobial peptides is unknown but may be the result of convergence of the stat <dig> and nf-κb pathways  <cit> . although studies in il-22ko and il-17rako mice have shown that il- <dig> has a significant but lesser protective role than il- <dig> in opc  <cit> , the present results demonstrate that neither cytokine is dispensable for protection against opc in the context of hiv transgene expression. this paradigm is likely applicable to other susceptible hosts, such as patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis who exhibit reduced production of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> .

consistent with a previous report  <cit> , expression of defb <dig> was induced by oral c. albicans infection in the non-tg mice. however, in contrast to s100a <dig>  expression of defb <dig> was not significantly diminished in the tg mice, despite the fact that expression of defb <dig> and s100a <dig> is induced by the same cytokines, including il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . future work will be needed to examine the signaling pathways leading to induction of defb <dig> and s100a <dig> in the tg mice  <cit> .

our data indicate that the protective effect of il- <dig> and il- <dig> treatment was most likely mediated by induction of s100a <dig> in the tg mice. calprotectin has been shown to be crucial for clearance of candida infection  <cit> , is produced at higher levels in patients with opc  <cit> , but is decreased by hiv infection  <cit> . no discernible influx of pmns was induced by the cytokine treatment. this is expected on the part of il- <dig>  which does not act on immune cells  <cit>  and is uninvolved in pmn recruitment to the oral mucosa in murine candidiasis  <cit> . although il-17-dependent pmn recruitment has been demonstrated in murine opc, these observations were done 5 days after primary oral infection with c. albicans  <cit> . early  <cit>  and more recent  <cit>  studies of experimental murine opc have consistently shown that the early pmn influx is maximal at 24-72 h after infection with c. albicans and is largely replaced by mononuclear cells after day  <dig> of infection. therefore, the lack of involvement of pmns in the protective response to cytokine treatment which we found at day  <dig> after primary c. albicans infection of the tg mice may more closely mimic the reality of the host-pathogen interaction found in hiv-infected patients with established opc, and provides evidence to support the concept that the mobilization of pmns may not be the primary underlying mechanism by which il- <dig> mediates antifungal effects at this stage of infection  <cit> .

although we have shown that defective il- <dig> and il- <dig> mucosal responses are involved in the susceptibility of the tg mice to opc, these observations do not in themselves fully explain the progressive reduction in oral burdens in untreated tg mice from day  <dig> to  <dig> after c. albicans infection, concluding with a lack of effect of cytokine treatment from day  <dig> to  <dig>  in fact, these observations suggest the participation of il-17-producing cell populations other than th <dig> cells in the response to opc in the tg mice, which could potentially include γδ t-cells, nkt cells, tc <dig> cd <dig> t-cells, and innate lymphoid cells  <cit> . indeed, evidence has been presented that il-17-producing cells other than classic cd4+ th <dig> cells protect from opc in cd4-deficient hosts  <cit> . of the potential il-17-producing cell populations, γδ t-cells and nkt cells have been shown to not contribute significantly to il- <dig> immunity in the oral mucosa  <cit> . however, cd8+ t-cells are protective in opc  <cit> , and we have previously shown that cd8+ t-cells accumulate in the oral mucosa of the tg mice in response to c. albicans  <cit>  and compensate in part for the loss of cd4+ t-cells  <cit> . it will therefore be relevant to further characterize these cells and determine if they belong to the tc <dig> phenotype. of note, il-17-producing innate lymphoid cells  <cit>  may also be an alternative source of this cytokine in the tg mice, considering that this cell population is depleted in the jejunum but not the oral mucosa of siv-infected macaques  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that susceptibility to opc in hiv-transgenic mice is caused by a defective il- <dig> and il-22-mediated response to c. albicans, producing a loss of mucosal antimicrobial peptide-mediated protective immunity.
