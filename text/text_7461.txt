BACKGROUND
many filamentous fungi have developed a predominantly saprobic lifestyle, in which successful competition with other microorganisms for the limited resources present in the environment is the key for survival. to this end mechanisms evolved that allow a rapid adaption to changing nutrient conditions. one such wide-domain regulatory circuit is carbon catabolite repression : it allows the preferred assimilation of carbon sources of high nutritional value over others  <cit> . this is usually achieved through inhibition of gene expression of enzymes involved in the catabolism of other carbon sources than the preferred ones. in multicellular ascomycetes, the c2h <dig> type transcription factor crea/cre1*, which is related to mig1/mig2/mig <dig> proteins that mediate glucose repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  and to the mammalian krox20/egr and wilm's tumour proteins  <cit> , has been shown to act as a repressor mediating ccr  <cit> . crea/cre <dig> binds to the promoters of the respective target genes via the consensus motif 5'-syggrg-3', whose function in vivo has been shown both in aspergillus nidulans and trichoderma reesei  <cit> . functional crea/cre <dig> binding sites frequently consist of two closely spaced 5'-syggrg-3'motifs, and it has been suggested that direct repression would only occur through such double binding sites  <cit> . in addition, phosphorylation of a serine in a conserved short stretch within an acidic domain of t. reesei cre <dig> has been demonstrated to regulate its dna binding  <cit> .

today, a plethora of genes have been shown to be under control of crea or cre <dig>  but the mechanisms triggering regulation by crea/cre <dig> are less well understood. in a. nidulans, regulation by crea can be initiated by several so called "repressing" hexoses, requires their phosphorylation, and is affected by the growth rate  <cit> . most studies on ccr in fungi have been made with gene model systems where ccr functions in the counteraction of gene induction  <cit> . in contrast, little information is available about which genes directly respond to a relief from ccr. since crea/cre1-knock out mutants display severe phenotypic changes such as reduced growth, abnormal hyphal morphology and sporulation  <cit> , such studies are only possible under carefully controlled conditions. here we chose to use chemostat cultures on d-glucose as a carbon source at two different growth rates  to investigate the genome-wide changes in gene expression in relation to cre <dig> function, using a Δcre <dig> recombinant mutant strain of t. reesei and corresponding control strain.

RESULTS
construction and phenotypic characteristics of a cre <dig> knock-out strain of t. reesei
we constructed a Δcre <dig> recombinant strain of t. reesei qm  <dig> by replacing its orf and part of its 5'-and 3'-nt regions by a hygromycin b resistance gene  <cit>  under constitutive expression signals. in accordance with nakari-setälä et al.  <cit> , the corresponding knock-out strains exhibited a reduced radial growth rate on plates, and formed smaller colonies, fewer aerial hyphae and less spores. in addition, the Δcre <dig> strain displayed shorter but more robust hyphae, that contained a considerably thickened cell wall and less septa . all these mutant phenotypes were eliminated by retransforming the Δcre <dig> strain with the cre <dig> gene, thus proving that they are cre <dig> specific . we used phenotype microarrays to analyze whether the above noted reduction in the growth rate is general or specific for some carbon sources only. the results showed that - in contrast to the radial growth on plates - the Δcre <dig> strain grew significantly slower on only  <dig> of  <dig> carbon sources , but on the other hand was unaffected on the majority of them . however, increased growth of > 30% of the control, which would be expected if cre <dig> represses growth on a given carbon source, was observed for  <dig> carbon sources shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> ; and glucuronamide + <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

wide domain regulation by cre1: experimental design and properties
we have used whole-genome dna microarrays with the goal of identifying the main genes in t. reesei that are controlled by cre <dig>  since carbon catabolite repression is known to be dependent on the growth rate, the microarray experiments were therefore performed in chemostat cultures at two constant growth rates that were earlier shown  <cit>  to be carbon repressing  and potentially carbon derepressing , respectively . after data pretreatment and normalization, we applied the linear modeling approach and the bayes statistics implemented in the limma r package  <cit>  to our biological replicates as described in the methods part. using these criteria we retrieved a list of  <dig> genes whose expression was regulated in at least one of the four experimental conditions. one of them was cre <dig> itself , which is trivial and was omitted from all further investigations. the  occurrence of the truly regulated  <dig> genes under the four different experimental conditions is shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  we used clustering algorithms  to divide them into  <dig> different clusters . the effect of cre <dig> and its interplay with the growth rate is summarized in figure 3:  <dig> % of the identified genes are in fact repressed by cre <dig>  but  <dig> % are cre <dig> induced and  <dig> % are cre <dig> independent. in addition,  <dig> % of the genes are influenced by the high growth rate ,  <dig> % are derepressed at the low growth rate and  <dig> % are growth rate independent. a complete list of all genes is given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  to confirm these microarray results, quantitative real-time-pcr  was performed on a subset of the genes belonging to different clusters. the gene for isocitrate lyase was included in this set, as its regulation by cre1-mediated carbon catabolite repression is known  and its appearance in our dataset confirms that the growth rates were chosen appropriately. as shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  these genes that showed differential expression between two or more of the used conditions in the microarray study were also differentially expressed in the same direction upon real time-pcr analysis. we therefore conclude that the microarray expression ratios indeed reflect differences in the expression of these genes.

up and down regulated genes were annotated and categorized as described in the methods section. the enrichment for the major funcat categories was assessed in each cluster, and a gene ontology  enrichment analysis was also done on the whole dataset as further control .

genes upregulated in the absence of cre <dig> function in t. reesei
as shown in figure  <dig>  genes which were upregulated in the Δcre <dig> mutant strain could be grouped into four classes: genes that were upregulated in the cre <dig> knockout independently of the growth rate ; genes upregulated in the cre <dig> knockout at high growth rate only ; genes for which cre <dig> function counteracted an induction at high growth rate ; and genes for which cre <dig> function counteracted an induction at low growth rate .

the cluster of the genes upregulated in the cre <dig> knockout at high growth rate  also exhibited genes linked to transcription regulation , as well as phia and ras <dig>  both participating in hyphal development.

this latter function was also represented with the bys <dig> transcript in the cluster of genes for which cre <dig> function counteracted an induction at high growth rate . this cluster comprised different genes linked to carbohydrate metabolism , as well as hsp <dig>  a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein that is induced by several stresses, including glucose limitation  <cit> .

as found for cluster e, the cluster that groups together genes for which cre <dig> function counteracted an induction at low growth rate  exhibited a majority of genes involved in cellular transport. a membrane protein linked to sporulation, cmp <dig>  has also been found in this cluster. the significance of the enrichment of these functional categories has been verified using gene ontology annotation .

genes contained in cluster x exhibited a heterogenous pattern of gene expression, but their expression was consistently highest in the Δcre <dig> strain at low growth rates, and lowest in the parental strain at high growth rates. we therefore conclude that genes of this cluster are also subject to cre1-dependent ccr. gene with putative functions did not reveal any common characteristics. however, we detected the orthologue of a. nidulans cred , which encodes a protein with arrestin and py motifs known to interact with ubiquitin ligase  <cit> . disruption of cred in a. nidulans confers partial relief from ccr  <cit> .

genes downregulated in the absence of cre <dig> function in t. reesei
the expression of a smaller number of genes was decreased in the Δcre <dig> strain, either only at the low  or the high growth rate , suggesting that cre <dig> acts - either directly or indirectly - positively on these genes. the highest number of genes from the cluster that groups together the genes downregulated in the cre <dig> knockout at high growth rate  corresponds to genes that encode proteins involved in cellular transport or proteins for which no function has been characterized . this cluster also comprised  <dig> genes for carbohydrate metabolism,  <dig> synthases and  <dig> oxidoreductases involved in secondary metabolite formation, as well as  <dig> transcription factors with zn2cys <dig> and bzip dna binding domains. cluster d, which comprise genes downregulated in the cre <dig> knockout at low growth rate, exhibited a significant enrichment of genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes. this cluster also exhibited a broad composition of other various gene categories, those encoding unknown proteins and compounds involved in cellular transport being most abundant.

genes regulated only by the growth rate but not by cre1
 <dig> % of the genes detected in this study displayed an expression pattern that was independent of cre <dig> function, i.e. their expression was different only between the two growth rates, but not in any direct comparison between the parent and the Δcre <dig> mutant strain.  <dig> of them were activated , whereas  <dig>  were actually repressed by a high growth rate. a significant enrichment of genes for carbohydrate metabolism has been detected in the cluster of genes repressed by the high growth rate , whereas the group of genes induced at high growth rate  comprised the whole set of genes needed to catabolize n-acetylglucosamine to fructose-6-phosphate and exhibited five genes dedicated to fatty acid metabolism .

presence of cre1-binding sites in the 5'-region of the identified genes
in order to link the diverse regulatory effects of cre <dig> identified in this study to a direct gene target, we looked for the cre <dig> binding pattern 5'-syggrg-3'  <cit>  in sequences  <dig> kb upstream of the coding region of the genes that were up-or down-regulated in the microarray experiments. for each cluster, an average number of sites per gene was calculated and normalized to the average number of sites per gene found in the whole t. reesei genome. since binding of crea/cre <dig> has been described to require two adjacent binding sites, or may be clustered in cis-regulatory element enriched regions , we also looked for the occurrence of direct or inverted repeats . the total number of these "paired motifs" was calculated for each gene, and an average per gene was again measured for each cluster, and then normalized to the average number in the genome. two spacing distances between the two motifs were tested, which were maximally  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp. for a value of  <dig> bp, the average number of complex motifs per gene for the whole genome was  <dig>  while it was  <dig>  for a  <dig> bp distance value. for each motif pair alone, values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . significance of the differences in average per cluster compared to the average on the whole genome was assayed with bi-directional student t-test. the relatively high frequency of the motifs, combined with the possible presence of genuine primary and secondary crea/cre <dig> target, resulted in often high standard deviation, making statistical validation difficult. however, the results  show that the cre <dig> binding motif, was significantly more abundant in the cre <dig> repressed cluster e, and in the cre <dig> activated cluster d. this observation was less clear for cluster h , while no enrichment was detected for cluster f and g . while we were not able to statistically validate this, a trend in enrichment is visible for cluster c, which groups together genes that were upregulated in the cre <dig> knockout independently of the growth rate. these results suggest that clusters d, e and maybe c are enriched in direct cre <dig> targets while clusters f and h are indirect results of the cre <dig> regulation. in support of this conclusion, the values obtained for the cre <dig> independent genes contained in clusters a and b were in the range of  the genomic average.

enrichments compared to whole genome values are shown.

results of statistical tests  are indicated as follow:

* p-value between  <dig>  and  <dig> ;

** p-value <  <dig> . values in bold are significant positive enrichments, which are predominantly discussed in the text.

we also looked for the presence of nucleotide motifs that are shared by genes regulated by cre <dig>  as described in the methods section. one of the detected motif using the rsa-tools software  was indeed significantly enriched in clusters d and e . this motif is otherwise found at least once at a 57% frequency in all t. reesei promoters.

discussion
the carbon catabolite regulator crea/cre <dig> is one of a few wide-domain master regulators identified in multicellular fungi, and has been shown to govern the repression of genes involved in polysaccharide degradation and in the utilization of ethanol and amino acids as carbon sources  <cit> . however, the major drawback inherent to these studies is that the growth rate was not controlled. using chemostat cultures, we show here that - depending of the gene considered - the function of t. reesei cre <dig> can be dependent on the growth rate, thus implying that the physiology of the fungal cell does affect the function of cre <dig> in different ways for different genes. in addition, we show that in  <dig> % of the detected genes, cre <dig> actually activates  their expression. this number is similar to crea-activated genes found in a. nidulans, although the latter investigated only a subset of the genome  <cit> . our data therefore illustrate that the function of cre <dig> is more complex than previously thought and clearly goes beyond ccr alone. cre <dig> should therefore rather be considered a master regulator of carbon metabolism that adjusts gene regulation in relation to the rate of glucose assimilation.

since the genome of t. reesei contains  <dig>  predicted genes  <cit> , the  <dig> highly differentially regulated genes we detected account for  <dig> %, which may be considered only a low percentage. however, this study did not detect those genes where cre <dig> interferes with the induction but not with basal transcription ; the number of genes actually controlled by cre <dig> is therefore probably larger and in many cases carbon-source-dependent. in this context, it is interesting to note that an orthologue of med <dig>  a component of the mediator complex that is conserved in all eukaryotes  <cit> , was found to be repressed by cre <dig>  this protein complex mediates signals between enhancer-bound factors  and the core transcriptional machinery. in s. cerevisiae, med <dig> - together with gal <dig> - has been shown to mediate the strongest activations  <cit> , thus making them being logical targets for regulation. the identification of t. reesei med <dig> as a ccr-repressed gene may hence be interpreted as an effective means by which the cell controls expression of a broad set of genes when a drop-down in the growth rate renders their induced expression uneconomic.

 <dig> of the genes identified in this study were in fact regulated by cre <dig>  whereas the other  <dig> only influenced by the growth rate independently of cre <dig> function.  <dig> of the cre1-regulated genes appeared to be repressed by cre <dig>  besides unknown proteins, genes encoding membrane permeases represent the highest portion indicating that t. reesei carbon catabolite repression acts preferentially at the entry of substrates into the cell. carbon catabolite repression of a high-affinity hexose permease is known in a. nidulans  <cit> , and constitutes a mechanism by which fungi can retrieve even traces of high value carbon sources at a high rate. interestingly, most of the permeases transporting nitrogenous compounds were regulated by cre <dig> in a growth-rate independent manner, suggesting that proteins and their degradation products are among the preferred substitutes for fast metabolizable carbohydrates. a similar increase in amino acid uptake upon ccr has been reported for s. cerevisiae  <cit> , but the effect was mig <dig> independent in this case. since the natural habitat of t. reesei  is poor in nitrogen but also in repressing carbon sources, this mechanism may enable the fungus to recruit available nitrogenous compounds at an enhanced rate.

there is a general believe that the transcription of genes encoding extracellular hydrolases  are repressed by cre <dig>  although this was in fact shown for several such genes in this study, they constituted only a very minor portion of the t. reesei cazome . particularly, although the regulation of e.g. cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes by cre <dig> has been demonstrated earlier  <cit> , none of these genes was strongly upregulated in the Δcre <dig> mutant. these data are in agreement with the findings that cre <dig> mediated carbon catabolite repression mainly affects their induction but not their basal expression  <cit> .

we and others have previously shown that loss-of-function of cre <dig> or crea leads to an alteration in nucleosome repositioning upon addition of glucose  <cit> . our detection of snf <dig> as a gene subject to repression by cre <dig> at a high growth rate offers an explanation for this finding: snf <dig> is a component of the yeast swi/snf multisubunit chromatin remodelling complex  <cit> , one of the cellular mechanisms altering chromatin structure by modulating dna-histone interactions  <cit> . swi/snf is required for the transcriptional regulation of about 5% of the total yeast genome  <cit>  and snf <dig> plays an essential role in it by associating with nucleosomes two helical turns from the dyad axis  <cit> .

it has also previously been reported that a loss-of-function mutation in crea/cre <dig> leads to an altered morphology and an impairment in sporulation. we identified several genes that could be responsible for the alterations in morphology in the Δcre <dig> strain: a central position may be played by ras <dig>  a small gtpase that was repressed by cre <dig> only at high growth rates but not by the growth rate itself. in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, ras <dig> regulates two distinct pathways: one that controls mating through the byr2-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and one that signals through scd1-cdc <dig> to maintain elongated cell morphology. in the filamentous fungi neurospora crassa and aspergillus fumigatus, the ras1/rasa orthologue has been reported to regulate morphology, asexual development and cell wall integrity  <cit> . also, s. cerevisiae ras <dig> is regulated by glucose  <cit> . it is therefore possible that ras <dig> is responsible for the phenotypic consequences of a cre <dig> loss-of-function, and the other genes may only indirectly be affected via ras <dig>  in fact, three of the genes associated with morphology or sporulation  were repressed by cre <dig> also at the high growth rate and the effect of cre <dig> could therefore be via ras <dig>  pag <dig> encodes a protein associated with protein kinase cbk1p and that is required for cell morphogenesis and proliferation in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . meda encodes an orthologue of fusarium oxysporum ren <dig>  aspergillus nidulans meda and magnaporthe grisea acr <dig>  <cit>  that are transcription regulators involved in conidiogenesis, and whose loss-of-function leads to abnormal conidiophores and rod-shaped, conidium-like cells. two other genes  were affected by cre <dig> also at the high growth rate. this regulation under conditions where ras <dig> is repressed implies that their expression is independent of the cre <dig> effects on ras <dig> and thus likely direct. both genes contain a paired cre <dig> binding motif in their promoter, which would support this assumption. our data suggest that the interplay between cre <dig> and ras <dig> may be an important factor regulating developmental processes in t. reesei.

an investigation of the occurrence of the established cre <dig> target sequence 5'-syggrg-3' in the regulated gene set confirmed its relevance to ccr, as  <dig> clusters out of the  <dig> that were regulated by cre <dig> were also enriched in this cre <dig> consensus site. in addition, an even higher enrichment was found for motif pairs biased toward crers . these findings are in accordance with previous results showing that only a double cre <dig> target is functionally in vivo  <cit> . in addition, we also identified an additional gc-rich  consensus to be overrepresented in cre <dig> regulated promoters. this motif has not been previously described in filamentous fungi or any other organism, and we therefore do not know which proteins, if any, bind to it. however, a study on motifs in mig1/mig2/mig <dig> regulated promoters in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  detected a 5'-gggagg-3' motif, which is completely covered by the 5'-sagggrgr-3' sequence. the authors reasoned that the 5'-gggagg-3' motif may bind a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in phosphate metabolism. however, none of the genes of our study that show an enrichment of the 5'-sagggrgr-3' sequence in their 5' nontranslated sequences, are involved in phosphate metabolism. notably, the presence or absence of the 5'-syggrg-3' motifs  in the promoters of regulated genes did not correlate with the way they are regulated by cre <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
carbon catabolite repression by crea/cre <dig> in filamentous fungi has mostly been studied in relation to the utilization of alternative carbon sources of either industrial interest , or genetic model systems such as ethanol and proline catabolism  <cit> , but these studies have so far not revealed the impact of this regulator on the physiology of the fungus in its natural environment. here, we have identified new targets for t. reesei cre <dig> and also dissected the dependence of their regulation on the rate of growth  of the fungus. noteworthy, a predominant effect of ccr seems to act at the transporter level and on the use of nitrogen substrates. several genes that could explain morphological changes and sporulation behavior were also affected. additionally, these growth-controlled environments also reflect some industrial conditions that can be used with fungi. the data and genes obtained will be a valuable basis for future attempts towards understanding the role of carbon nutrition for saprobic fungi. finally, the strategy used in this paper may be useful also in further studies of other wide domain regulators in fungi.
