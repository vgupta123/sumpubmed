BACKGROUND
mycotoxins are naturally occurring secondary metabolites produced by fungi. they can be formed in the field on crops as well as during storage and are chemically very stable, enabling them to survive processing, and thereby end up in the feed and food chain. in the northern temperate regions fusarium species are the most prevalent toxigenic fungi  <cit>  with trichothecenes, fumonisins and zearalenone being the most important toxins produced  <cit> . if ingested, these mycotoxins can cause a variety of adverse health effects, both on humans and animals  <cit> . since the gastrointestinal epithelium is the first barrier to come in contact with mycotoxins after ingestion, several studies investigated the effects of mycotoxins on intestinal cells. most of these were conducted on human intestinal epithelial caco- <dig> cells  <cit> , but also the porcine intestinal epithelial cell lines ipec- <dig>  <cit>  and ipec-j <dig>  <cit>  have been used to demonstrate that mycotoxins can alter the integrity of the gut barrier. moreover, pinton et al. <cit>  showed that the trichothecene deoxynivalenol  selectively affects the expression of tight junction proteins in porcine intestinal epithelial cell monolayers  and caco- <dig> cell monolayers resulting in increased paracellular passage of fluorescein isothiocyanate -dextran and escherichia coli. it was also demonstrated that fumonisin b <dig>  affects the membrane composition of ipec- <dig> cells resulting in an increased passage of this toxin  <cit> . intestinal epithelial cells are thus important targets for the toxic effects of mycotoxins and it is clear that an altered barrier could result in an altered passage of mycotoxin co-contaminants, xenobiotics and pathogens.

the aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of the four most important fusarium mycotoxins i.e. don, t- <dig> toxin , zearalenone  and fb <dig> in intestinal epithelial cells derived from the jejunum of pigs . therefore the percentage viable, apoptotic and necrotic ipec-j <dig> cells was determined using flow cytometry. correlatively, it was investigated whether differences in cell viability result in a changed transepithelial passage of the antibiotics doxycycline and paromomycin. this was studied using transwell® devices which are commonly applied and widely accepted to perform permeability studies. the hypothesis tested in this study was that an altered integrity of the gut barrier provoked by mycotoxins, could result in an increased passage of antibiotics through the epithelium. increased passage of these antibiotics can indeed have toxic consequences for the animal, withdrawal time, and consequently public health with respect to possible residues of drugs in edible tissues. to our knowledge, this is the first time that transport of antibiotics is used as a marker to study possible damage of mycotoxins to intestinal epithelial cells.

methods
cell line and culture conditions
the ipec-j <dig> cell line is a continuous intestinal cell line originally derived from jejunal epithelia isolated from a neonatal, unsuckled piglet and maintained as a continuous culture  <cit> . cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium /ham’s f <dig>  medium , supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum , 1%  insulin/transferrin/na-selenite , 1%  penicillin/streptomycin  and 1%  kanamycin , further referred to as culture medium. the cells were routinely seeded at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml with  <dig> ml medium in plastic tissue culture flasks , maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°c under 5% co <dig>  and passaged every 2– <dig> days. all experiments were performed with cells within maximal  <dig> passages.

chemicals
don, t- <dig>  fb <dig> and zea  stock solutions of  <dig> μg/ml were prepared in methanol for don, ethanol for t- <dig> and acetonitrile for fb <dig> and zea . doxycycline and paromomycin stock solutions  were prepared in high-performance liquid chromatography  grade water. all stock solutions were stored at −20°c. serial dilutions were prepared in culture medium in order to obtain non-cytotoxic concentrations of organic solvents and antibiotics, and allowing the addition of a similar volume of vehicle in all experiments.

determination of non-cytotoxic concentrations of the organic solvents
ipec-j <dig> cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml in a total volume of  <dig> μl. the cells were maintained in an atmosphere of 5% co <dig> at 37°c. after overnight incubation, the cells were treated for  <dig> h with a final concentration of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 20% of the organic solvents  in the total volume of culture medium. next, to assess cytotoxicity,  <dig> μl of a water soluble tetrazolium salt -3--5--2h-tetrazolium)  was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°c for an additional  <dig> h. the absorbance was determined at  <dig> nm using a microplate elisa reader . each experiment was conducted in triplicate. the percentage of viable cells was calculated using the following formula:

 %viability=100×c−b–a−b/c−b 

in this formula a = od450nm derived from the wells incubated with solvent, b = od450nm derived from blank wells, c = od450nm derived from untreated control wells.

assessment of cytotoxicity after exposure of ipec-j <dig> cells to the investigated antibiotics doxycycline and paromomycin
a flow cytometric technique was used to assess the direct cytotoxic effect of the antibiotics doxycycline and paromomycin. ipec-j <dig> cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 ×  <dig> cells/ml in 24-well plates in  <dig> ml of culture medium and allowed to grow for  <dig> h. next, cells were treated for  <dig> h with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml of doxycycline or paromomycin. each experiment was conducted in triplicate. after the incubation period, cells were trypsinized, culture medium and cells were collected, centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g and 4°c and resuspended in  <dig>  ml hank’s buffered salt solution . this procedure was repeated three times in order to remove cellular debris and antibiotics. cell death was assessed using dual staining with annexin-v-fluorescein isothiocyanate  and propidium iodide  which allows the discrimination of viable cells , apoptotic  and necrotic cells . cells were incubated for  <dig> min in the dark on ice with  <dig> μl of a solution containing  <dig> μl annexin-v-fitc and  <dig> μl pi dissolved in  <dig> μl incubation buffer containing  <dig> mm 4--1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ,  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  cells were assessed by a facscanto flow cytometer  and the percentage of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells was obtained using the facsdiva software .

assessment of cytotoxicity after exposure of ipec-j <dig> cells to fusarium toxins
the flow cytometric technique as described above was also used to assess the direct cytotoxic effect of mycotoxins. ipec-j <dig> cells were seeded at a concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in 24-well plates in  <dig> ml of culture medium and allowed to grow for  <dig> h. next, cells were treated for  <dig> h with increasing concentrations of t- <dig> , don , zea  and fb <dig> . the molar concentration corresponding with  <dig> μg/ml don, fb <dig> and zea and  <dig> ng/ml t- <dig> is  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  nm, respectively. each experiment was conducted in triplicate. after the incubation period, cells were processed as described above before analysis on the facscanto flow cytometer. the concentration corresponding to 50% reduction in viable cells  was calculated with linear regression curves. a positive control was provided by cells single stained with annexin-v-fitc and cells single stained with pi, also used to determine spectral overlap, after treatment for  <dig> h with  <dig> μg/ml don. furthermore, unstained cells  were also included to determine autofluorescence of ipec-j <dig> cells.

assessment of teer after exposure of ipec-j <dig> cells to don and t-2
the effect of don and t- <dig> on barrier integrity was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance  using a millicell electrical resistance system . cells were grown and differentiated on transwell® collagen-coated polytetrafluoroethylene  membrane inserts  at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml. culture medium was replaced three times a week and ipec-j <dig> cells were used for teer experiments at day  <dig> post-seeding. next, cells were incubated for  <dig> h with different concentrations of t- <dig>  or don . teer was measured every  <dig> h from the start of the toxin exposure until  <dig> days. teer values were expressed as kΩ × cm <dig>  each single experiment was conducted in threefold.

passage of doxycycline and paromomycin after exposure of ipec-j <dig> cells to don and t-2
cells were seeded on transwell® collagen-coated pfte membrane inserts as described above for the teer experiment. only cells which are cultured for  <dig> days show stable teer values indicating cells have reached confluence and form a tight monolayer . next, cells were incubated for  <dig> h with different concentrations of t- <dig>  or don , during which the last  <dig> h a non-cytotoxic concentration of both paromomycin  and doxycycline  was added to the apical  compartment of the transwell. to evaluate the permeability of the monolayers,  <dig> μl of transport medium was withdrawn from the basolateral  compartment at time  <dig>  and at  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after addition of the drugs and replaced immediately by  <dig> μl of fresh culture medium. each experiment was conducted in triplicate.

acceptor media were analyzed for the paromomycin content by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . the lc-ms/ms system consisted of a surveyor autosampler plus and ms pump plus, coupled to a tsq quantum ultra® triple quadrupole mass spectrometer . chromatographic separation was performed on a plrp-s column  using a gradient programme . the mobile phase consisted of   <dig> mm pentafluoropropionic acid   in water and   <dig> mm pfpa in water/acetonitrile  . the ms instrument was operated in the selected reaction monitoring  mode, using two precursor ion > product ion transitions. tobramycin  was used as internal standard . samples were prepared by pipetting  <dig> μl culture medium into an eppendorf cup . each sample was spiked with  <dig> μl of the is working solution of  <dig> μg/ml in hplc grade water  and diluted with  <dig> μl methanol,  <dig> μl hplc grade water and  <dig> μl  <dig> mm pfpa. after vortexing, samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  <dig> × g for  <dig> min to remove possible solid particles. the sample was transferred into screw-capped conical vials and  <dig> μl were injected onto the lc-ms/ms system.

doxycycline concentrations were determined using the same lc-ms/ms configuration and hplc column as for paromomycin analysis. the mobile phase consisted of   <dig> % acetic acid in water and  acetonitrile. a gradient programme was applied and the flow-rate was  <dig> μl/min. the ms instrument was operated in the srm mode, using two precursor ion > product ion transitions. demethylchlortetracycline  was used as is. samples were prepared by pipetting  <dig> μl culture medium into an eppendorf cup. each sample was spiked with  <dig>  μl of the is working solution of  <dig> μg/ml in hplc grade water, followed by the addition of  <dig> μl  <dig> % formic acid in hplc grade water. after vortexing briefly and centrifugation,  <dig> μl were injected onto the lc-ms/ms system.

the limit of quantification  was  <dig> ng/ml for both doxycycline and paromomycin. a detailed description of both methods can be found in goossens et al.  <cit> .

statistical analysis
data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance  to address the significance of difference between mean values with significance set at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
a concentration of 1% ethanol, 5% methanol or 5% acetonitrile of the total volume of culture medium was determined to be non-cytotoxic for ipec-j <dig> cells
a final concentration of 5% acetonitrile, 5% methanol and 1% ethanol was accepted to use in the experiment as the viability of ipec-j <dig> cells was on average > 95%. non-cytotoxic concentrations of the solvents were ensured by appropriate dilution of the toxins stock solutions in culture medium.

a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml doxycycline and  <dig> μg/ml paromomycin was determined to be non-cytotoxic for ipec-j <dig> cells
a concentration up to  <dig> μg/ml doxycycline or paromomycin caused no significant reduction in cell viability of ipec-j <dig> cells. it was concluded that a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml doxycycline and  <dig> μg/ml paromomycin could be used in the experiments. the concentration of the antibiotics was based on, on the one hand, the dose of the antibiotic that is usually administered to pigs, and on the other hand, the capacity of the intestine of an adult pig. when  <dig> mg/kg body weight doxycycline and  <dig> mg/kg body weight paromomycin is administered to a pig of  <dig> kg, and this dose ends up in an intestinal volume of  <dig>  l, this corresponds with a concentration of about  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml respectively.

induction of necrosis and apoptosis in ipec-j <dig> cells is fusarium toxin dependent
exposure of ipec-j <dig> cells for  <dig> h to different mycotoxin concentrations showed a concentration-dependent toxicity. t- <dig> was clearly the most toxic one with a significantly lower percentage of annexin-v-fitc and pi negative cells in the ng/ml range compared to don and zea which were toxic in the μg/ml range.

fb <dig> was not toxic at the tested concentrations. for all mycotoxins, except t- <dig> toxin, a higher percentage of annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative cells rather than annexin-v-fitc and pi positive cells can be found after exposure of undifferentiated ipec-j <dig> cells for  <dig> h to different toxin concentrations. for t- <dig> toxin, the majority of dead cells were annexin-v-fitc and pi positive. the ic <dig> for don and t- <dig> was determined to be  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  ng/ml, respectively.

cytotoxic concentrations of don and t- <dig> induce a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance  across the ipec-j <dig> monolayer
figures  <dig> and  <dig> represent the effect of don and t- <dig> on teer of differentiated ipec-j <dig> cells, respectively.

both for t- <dig> and don, a drop in teer can be seen  <dig> h after incubation of ipec-j <dig> cells with cytotoxic concentrations of the mycotoxins. treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations results in teer values comparable to those of the control cells. treatment of differentiated ipec-j <dig> cells with  <dig> μg/ml don shows a time-dependent decline in teer.

disruption of epithelial integrity of the ipec-j <dig> cell monolayer results in increased passage of doxycycline and paromomycin
figures  <dig> and  <dig> represent the passage of doxycycline and paromomycin across the ipec-j <dig> cell monolayer treated for  <dig> h with several concentrations of don and t- <dig>  respectively.

in both the t- <dig> and don experiment, increased passage of doxycycline and paromomycin was seen after incubation of ipec-j <dig> cells with cytotoxic concentrations of the tested mycotoxins.

discussion
the gastrointestinal tract can be exposed to high concentrations of mycotoxins after ingestion of mycotoxin contaminated food or feed. since swine are the most sensitive domestic animal species to mycotoxins  <cit> , this study aimed to investigate the toxic effect of four common fusarium toxins, t- <dig>  don, zea and fb <dig> on ipec-j <dig> cells. studies concerning the effects of mycotoxins on ipec-j <dig> cells are limited. the concentrations of the mycotoxins tested in this study are the result of several optimization experiments performed to refine the concentration range to be used for these in vitro experiments. according to sergent et al. <cit>  don concentrations in human intestine are estimated between  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml depending on the contamination level of the feed, including thus our tested range. mycotoxin concentrations in the test solutions are not based on levels known to cause problems in pigs, but are based on the cytotoxicity results of the flow cytometer experiments, the solubility of the mycotoxin in aqueous solvents, and cost of the mycotoxin.

in vitro cell viability assays have a central role in predictive toxicology. the capability of commonly used colorimetric assays, such as the wst- <dig>  mtt - <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and mts assay -5--2--2h-tetrazolium) or the lactate dehydrogenase  bioassay to detect cytotoxic effects is, however, limited. cells that are apoptotic remain undetected with these assays. our study used a flow cytometric technique, which allows to distinguish annexin-v-fitc and pi negative  cells from annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative  cells and annexin-v-fitc and pi positive  cells.

after  <dig> h of exposure with t- <dig>  don, fb <dig> or zea, t- <dig> clearly was the most cytotoxic with a toxicity in the ng/ml range, while the other mycotoxins are only toxic at concentrations in the μg/ml range. this finding is in accordance with the study of calvert et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that t- <dig> was most cytotoxic against three human cell lines tested as determined by the mtt assay.

when comparing the percentage annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative cells and annexin-v-fitc and pi positive cells, it is striking that more annexin-v-fitc and pi positive cells than annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative cells were found after treatment of the cells with t- <dig>  this corresponds, however, with findings in practice where t- <dig>  present in feed, causes skin necrosis  <cit> . also necrosis of the lymphoid cells of the intestinal mucosa was seen after intake of t- <dig> contaminated feed  <cit> . don, on the other hand, causes more annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative cells than annexin-v-fitc and pi positive cells. the discrepancy between type a  and type b  trichothecenes was also demonstrated by nasri et al.  <cit>  who showed that don causes rather apoptosis and t- <dig> rather necrosis in jurkat t-lymphocytes. as it is known that type b trichothecenes activate the mapk signaling pathway resulting in apoptosis, while type a trichothecenes are not able to activate the mapk families  <cit> , the authors suggested this as an explanation for the results. for zea and fb <dig>  although fb <dig> was not cytotoxic at the tested concentrations, an approximately equal percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells were seen after treatment of ipec-j <dig> cells for  <dig> h with those toxins. our results suggest that different toxins may induce different types of cell death in ipec-j <dig> cells. to our knowledge, this is the first report of don and t- <dig> induced different mechanisms of cell death in ipec-j <dig> cells. since it was not the principal aim of this study to elaborate further the differences in the mode of cell death induced by different mycotoxins, no further experiments were conducted. nevertheless, it could be interesting to investigate these differences in more detail, including the investigation of associated pathway molecules, the analysis of potential protective effects of caspase inhibitors and/or necrose inhibitors, etc. also other types of cell death can be taken into account since there are more than two ways for a cell to die. cell death can be classified according to its morphological appearance , enzymological criteria , functional aspects  or immunological characteristics   <cit> . it could be interesting exploring these differences in relation with mycotoxins.

correlatively with direct cytotoxicity, the consequences on barrier integrity  were also assessed. the effect on teer and passage was only studied for don and t- <dig> because, of the four mycotoxins tested in this study, these are the most toxic ones and their ratio of annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative cells and annexin-v-fitc and pi positive cells is antithetic. notwithstanding the assertion of geens and niewold  <cit>  that ipec-j <dig> cells cultured on transwell®-collagen coated inserts with a surface area of  <dig>  cm <dig> are not appropriate to measure teer values, our ipec-j <dig> monolayer showed teer values above  <dig> kΩ cm <dig> after  <dig> weeks of culturing. according to fromter and diamond  <cit> , ipec-j <dig> cell lines with teer values of approximately  <dig> kΩ cm <dig> can be considered to be tight epithelia. when ipec-j <dig> cells were incubated with cytotoxic concentrations of don  and t- <dig>  teer values dropped to nearly  <dig> kΩ cm <dig> after  <dig> h suggesting a complete disruption of the epithelial monolayer within  <dig> h. in contrast, teer values of ipec-j <dig> cells incubated with non-toxic concentrations  were comparable to the teer of control cells. treatment with  <dig> μg/ml don on the other hand shows a time-dependent reduction of the teer. this was also reported by pinton et al.  <cit>  who showed a time- and dose-dependent reduction of the teer after exposure of ipec- <dig> and caco- <dig> cells to different concentrations  of don. a decreased barrier function in vitro is reflected in both a decreased teer and an increased tracer flux  <cit> . in our study, the decrease in teer is related to the passage of the used tracers, doxycycline   <dig> da) and paromomycin , two commonly used antibiotics in pig industry. the higher the toxin concentration, the higher the marker passage. most studies use tracers such as fitc-dextran, while in this study and for the first time the antibiotics doxycycline and paromomycin were used as markers. we were, however, not capable of demonstrating that induction of more apoptosis or more necrosis results in differences in transepithelial passage of antibiotics. both doxycycline and paromomycin pass the epithelial monolayer, regardless the induction of a different cell death mechanism.

it is very interesting to study the passage of these therapeutic compounds during in vivo trials, as veterinary drugs are often used in pig mass medication and frequently administered by the oral route, i.e. mixed in the feed or drinking water.

CONCLUSIONS
when discussing the relevance of the in vitro results for the in vivo situation it needs to be taken into account that enterocytes are not continuously exposed to mycotoxins. rather a time-dependent fluctuation in mycotoxin concentrations exists in vivo, whereas in vitro cells are exposed continuously at constant concentrations. nevertheless, the current in vitro findings warrant further investigation in vivo because an increased passage of antibiotics may have important implications for both animal and human health. increased absorption of antibiotics may lead to higher plasma levels, including the risk of exceeding the toxic threshold. moreover, increased antibiotic plasma levels may also lead to a tissue residue problem in slaughter animals and inherent food safety concerns. it could thus be interesting to investigate in vivo the effect of mycotoxins on the intestinal absorption of antibiotics.
