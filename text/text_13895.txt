BACKGROUND
human brains are different from other primate brains. however, it is not clear if the difference is simply a matter of size  <cit>  or if there are any molecular and cellular differences that would help explain uniquely human capabilities. one molecular difference that might be important for the acquisition of such a capability, namely of speech, is the substitution of two amino acids in the protein foxp <dig> . other human-specific differences have been discovered in proteins expressed in the brain, but have not yet been linked to a behavioral phenotype ⁠.

it has been surmised for more than 30 years that the main genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees lie in regulatory sequences  <cit> , and recent studies have begun to identify some of the more relevant human-specific elements . however, even with the increasing number of sequenced human and other primate genomes, it remains more difficult to identify functionally relevant differences in non-coding parts of the genome, even in well-studied transcription factor binding sites  <cit> , than in protein-coding sequences. therefore, the present study concentrates on differences in the protein-coding parts of the genome.

while the genomes of individuals from extinct human populations are exciting sources of information on human evolution , we lack reliable information on the cognitive capabilities of those populations  <cit> . therefore, the most useful comparison is with living primates, on whose cognitive phenotype we do have information  <cit> : a dna variant might contribute to human cognitive capabilities if it is present in all cognitively normal modern humans, but not in the aligned genomes of other primates. the analysis of primate genomes has yielded lists of such variants ; however, the statistical tests for positive selection are necessarily of low statistical power and selectivity, and the necessary biochemical analysis of such candidate genes has rarely been reported  <cit> .

the initial auto-organization of the human brain and its subsequent forming by the environment are mediated by cell surface proteins . variation in adhesion proteins has been shown to degrade  <cit>  and, possibly, to explain part of normal variation in cognitive function  <cit> . while the example of foxp <dig> shows that intracellular proteins, such as transcription factors, may be important targets of change, the function of proteins present at the cell membrane, such as receptors, channels and adhesion proteins, is more straightforward to quantify. therefore, the bioinformatical strategy used in the present study was to rank all proteins present on the surface of human central nervous system cells by the number of substitutions they have accumulated on the human lineage. the aim of this strategy was to select a neural cell surface protein with high probability of having changed its function on the human lineage, so that this functional change could be tested for in biological model systems.

RESULTS
selection of candidate protein
a comparison of the protein-coding regions of the reference chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque genomes to  <dig> haploid human genomes, sampled from diverse human populations, has been published before  <cit>  and resulted in a list of amino acid positions where all modern human genomes agree with each other and are different from the non-human primates. almost half of all human proteins contain at least one such amino acid .fig.  <dig> pipeline for discovering human-specific amino acid substitutions. amino acids in human proteins were considered human-specific wherever they differed from the consensus between the exomes of macaca mulatta, pongo abelii and pan troglodytes. differences were considered fixed if the human-specific amino acid recurred in  <dig> haploid human genomes. among those proteins that could be aligned between the four genomes, the indicated number of proteins contains at least one fixed human-specific difference



the present study focuses on the substitutions occurring in brain cell-surface proteins, i.e. the products of genes annotated both as being expressed in central nervous system cells and as present on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, according to gene ontology  <cit> . among  <dig> proteins in this set,  <dig> contain at least one fixed human-specific difference . an unknown fraction of these human-specific substitutions may have had functional consequences. while ideally the functional consequences might be estimated from the position of a substitution within the three-dimensional structure of a protein, especially if structure-function relationships are well established, such structural data are not available for many of the candidate proteins. alternatively, reasoning that a change in function may require several amino acid substitutions or that a change, once it has occurred, may release a functional restraint and permit additional substitutions to occur, the  <dig> candidate proteins were ordered by the number of fixed human-specific amino acid differences, with β-protocadherin  <dig>  appearing at the top of the list, due to its  <dig> substitutions .table  <dig> proteins on the surface of central nervous system cells that have accumulated the highest number of amino acid substitutions on the human lineage

for each protein, the number of human-specific substitutions, divided by the length of the protein, gives the fraction of amino acids that have changed and become fixed on the human lineage. for each amino acid substitution on the human lineage, a weight was derived from the blosum <dig> matrix that reflects the rareness of this exchange between organisms that have 99 % amino acid identity, and the weights of all substitutions were summed up for each protein



while a high number of substitutions does not necessarily indicate a change in function, several aspects make pcdhb <dig> stand out from other proteins on the list. higher numbers of substitutions would be expected to occur by chance in longer proteins; the absolute number was therefore divided by the length of the protein to exclude this explanation. the high rate of substitutions in several proteins, such as pcdh <dig>  can readily be explained by their large size, but pcdhb <dig> continues to stand out . furthermore, in exome comparisons, some amino acids are frequently found in substitution for each other, probably because their exchange has a lower impact on the function of the protein. the rate of amino acid exchange, when comparing proteins in closely related species, was used in order to weigh the importance of an exchange; amino acids that rarely substitute for each other were given higher weights. when summing up the weights for all the substitutions, pcdhb <dig> continues to have a score well above those of all the other candidate proteins , due to several evolutionarily rare amino acid exchanges, e.g. asparagine to isoleucine and arginine to isoleucine .table  <dig> differences between non-human primate consensus and human pcdhb11

functional data show the importance of the distribution of the substitutions among the domains of the protein. clustered protocadherins are proposed to serve as adhesion proteins that may regulate synaptic contacts between neurons  <cit> . so far, the function of murine, but not human, clustered protocadherins has been tested in cell culture models and intact organisms . in cell culture, among six extracellular cadherin repeats, one transmembrane and one cytoplasmic domain, the ones most important for protocadherin specificity are ec <dig> and ec <dig>  <cit> , and nine of the changes in human pcdhb <dig> are concentrated in these two domains , suggesting again that they might be relevant.

very recently, crystal structures of the ec1- <dig> domains of several murine protocadherins, among them the β-protocadherin pcdhb <dig>  have been published  <cit> . by homology to the crystal structure of monomeric pcdhb <dig> ec1- <dig>  <cit> , all ten human-specific amino acids in these domains of pcdhb <dig> are expected to be at least partly exposed to water; such surface-exposed amino acids are less constrained by the structure and may therefore be more variable, unless they contribute to dimer interfaces. in this regard, it is relevant to note that thr <dig> in the pcdhb <dig> structure, corresponding to human-specific pcdhb <dig> ser <dig>  hydrogen bonds with thr <dig>  which was shown to be necessary for protocadherin dimerization in a cell-based assay  <cit> . furthermore, the residue corresponding to human-specific pcdhb <dig> ser <dig> contributes to crystal contacts in certain γ-protocadherins, and so do the ec <dig> β4-β <dig>  the phe-x10-phe loop and the ec <dig> β <dig> loop, which in pcdhb <dig> are predicted to contain human-specific ile <dig>  phe <dig> and his <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

while crystal contacts are not evidence of functional importance, and different clustered protocadherins may dimerize slightly differently, the homologies mentioned would suggest, on a purely structural basis, that some of the human-specific mutations might affect the adhesivity of pcdhb <dig>  however, these putative conclusions from bioinformatical investigation depend on functional confirmation.

following an established protocol  <cit> , human pcdhb <dig> and a well-investigated murine control, pcdhga <dig>  were electroporated into the normally non-adhesive human suspension cell line k <dig>  murine pcdhga <dig> caused the appearance of large cell clusters, as previously described ; cells expressing human pcdhb <dig> formed clusters, but smaller ones . the proportion of larger cell clusters among all cells was quantified in four independent transfections; the adhesive strength conferred by human pcdhb <dig> was significant when compared to negative controls, but significantly lower than that conferred by murine pcdhga <dig> .fig.  <dig> homophilic adhesion of pcdhb <dig> and pcdhga <dig> in human suspension cells. gfp was electroporated alone  or in combination with human pcdhb <dig>  or murine pcdhga <dig>  into k <dig> cells; in the same way, mcherry was electroporated alone  or in combination with reverted pcdhb <dig>  or murine pcdhga <dig> . scale bar: 250 μm. g fraction of large clusters , medium clusters  or small clusters  in each condition. h adhesive strength of cells in each condition as proportion of clusters with ≥  <dig> cells, relative to the condition with the same fluorescent protein and pcdhga <dig>  error bars: standard error of mean. the three levels of protocadherin  were significantly different from each other 



the weak adhesivity of pcdhb11-transfected cells might be explained by low expression levels. however, the expression of pcdhb <dig> fused to green fluorescent protein  was easily detected by western blot . it has been shown that n-terminal hemagglutinine  tags, which allow selective staining of surface-exposed proteins, do not reduce the adhesion mediated by γ-protocadherins  <cit> . reasoning that an n-terminal ha-tag would also preserve any adhesion mediated by pcdhb <dig>  cells were transfected with ha-pcdhb11-gfp or murine ha-pcdhga <dig>  ha-pcdhb11-gfp was expressed at much lower levels , and this was reflected in lower surface expression  and a lower proportion of large cell clusters  than with ha-pcdhga <dig>  nevertheless, pcdhb <dig> was expressed and reached the cell surface.fig.  <dig> expression of protocadherins. gfp was electroporated alone or in combination with protocadherins into k <dig> cells. a immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-gfp shows bands compatible with the expected molecular weights for gfp  and mature pcdhb11-gfp ; image representative of three transfections. b immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-ha shows bands compatible with the expected molecular weights for mature ha-pcdhb11-gfp  and ha-pcdhga <dig> ; image representative of two transfections. c proportion of medium and large clusters was lower in ha-pcdhb11-gfp-transfected than in ha-pcdhga3-transfected cells, but higher than in control cells . d proportion of medium to large cell clusters when normalized by ha-pcdhga <dig>  for visualization of surface protocadherins, live cells transfected with gfp alone  or in combination with ha-pcdhb11-gfp  or ha-pcdhga <dig>  were stained with anti-ha-biotin and streptavidin-alexa <dig>  then fixed. blue: dapi. green: gfp. red: surface ha-tagged protocadherins. scale bar: 10 μm



one reason for the low adhesivity of human pcdhb <dig> would be a loss of function as consequence of one or more of the mutations that occurred during human evolution. in order to test for an effect of the human-specific substitutions, a protein with reversion of these substitutions to the consensus sequence of non-human primate pcdhb <dig> proteins  was synthesized and expressed in k <dig> cells. this reverted pcdhb <dig> had adhesive properties indistinguishable from modern human pcdhb <dig> . while it is not possible to exclude subtle changes, based on the present data, a complete loss or gain of adhesivity, due to the human-specific substitutions, can be refuted.

the properties of both reverted and modern human pcdhb <dig> were also investigated by quantifying co-clustering with other cells. different populations of k <dig> cells were transfected with protocadherins and either green or red fluorescent protein, and the two populations were mixed on the following day. as expected, k <dig> cells without any protocadherin did not form clusters , nor did cells transfected with a protocadherin form mixed clusters with negative controls . cells transfected with pcdhga <dig> and pcdhb <dig>  respectively, did not adhere to each other, which would manifest as a high proportion of mixed clusters . however, two cell populations, each transfected with murine pcdhga <dig>  adhered strongly to each other, as expected . in mixtures of modern and ancestral pcdhb11-expressing cells, some mixed clusters were observed , which were smaller than the pcdhga <dig> clusters. the co-occurrence of green and red cells in the same clusters was quantified in each condition . pcdhb11-expressing cells adhered more to each other than to negative controls or to murine pcdhga <dig>  the human-specific changes did not abolish the weak mutual adhesion.fig.  <dig> specificity of adhesion of pcdhb <dig>  different populations of k <dig> cells were separately electroporated as in fig.  <dig>  where one population received gfp and a protocadherin, and the other mcherry and a protocadherin. green and red populations were mixed 24-48 h later, rocked for 2 h and then photographed while still alive. a-p the identity of the protocadherins in the green and red populations are indicated. scale bar: 250 μm. q for each pair of cell populations, the conditions with switched fluorophores were joined, and the proportion of mixed clusters  was expressed as fraction of all clusters. in an overall 2-way anova, the identity of the cell populations and their interaction were each highly significant . in each subpanel, the identity of the second cell population was significant . in each subpanel, the second cell populations were significantly different from control where indicated 



intra-human variability in pcdhb11
since these assays did not reveal a change in the adhesion function of pcdhb <dig>  the high number of human-specific amino acid substitutions in pcdhb <dig> might be thought to be due to a higher local mutational burden or reduced purifying selection. such processes would necessarily increase variability among humans. however, it has been reported before, in an ethnically homogeneous sample, that human pcdhb <dig> had lower variability than other β-protocadherin genes  <cit> . here, the numbers of non-synonymous minor alleles in all human β-protocadherins were reanalyzed using dbsnp; they ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> variable positions, and the number for pcdhb <dig> was  <dig>  coincidentally the median of the distribution . this normal intra-human variability of pcdhb <dig> stands in contrast to the evolutionary data, where pcdhb <dig> has a much higher number of human-specific amino acid substitutions than any other β-protocadherin .fig.  <dig> intra-human variability of pcdhb <dig> is not elevated. for each protein in the human pcdhb cluster, the number of positions subject to intra-human variability is shown as black open diamonds  and the number of substitutions on the human lineage as red full circles . shaded grey bar: pcdhb11



discussion
the aim of this work was to search systematically for the brain protein that has changed the most during human evolution and that might contribute to uniquely human brain function and pathology  <cit> . evolutionary studies, such as the present one, might help to pinpoint molecules important for human functioning  <cit> . the most promising candidate from the bioinformatical part of the work was the β-protocadherin pcdhb <dig> 

the β-protocadherin cluster, as a whole, was shown to be rapidly diverging between humans and chimpanzees  <cit> . according to the allen brain atlas  <cit> , pcdhb <dig> mrna is expressed in the human brain, especially in the hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra and locus ceruleus  <cit> . human pcdhb <dig> has no direct murine homolog  <cit> , but murine β-protocadherin mrnas are expressed combinatorially in purkinje cells  <cit> . at the protein level, some murine β-protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in synapses of the central nervous system  <cit> . with regard to the physiological importance of β-protocadherins, the only data in humans so far have revealed a very high expression of pcdhb <dig> and pcdhb <dig> on the melanoma cell surface  <cit> . hypermethylation of promoters in the protocadherin clusters, collectively, which is expected to downregulate gene expression, is a signal of wilms’ tumor  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit>  and neuroblastoma .

the most widely accepted model for the operation of clustered protocadherins is homophilic adhesion, where a hetero-oligomer of α-, β- and/or γ-protocadherins on the surface of one cell binds to an oligomer of the exact same composition on the surface of another cell  <cit> . while this homophilic binding can be measured as the formation of cell clusters in the k <dig> cell line model, in neurons it is proposed to lead to synapse disruption and therefore dendritic self-avoidance, optimizing the coverage of a neuron’s territory  <cit> . the present data extend this established cell culture model for the first time to a human protocadherin. human pcdhb <dig> does induce the formation of k <dig> cell clusters, but at a very low level, and this low adhesivity has apparently been characteristic of pcdhb <dig> since before the divergence of human and chimpanzees. it is unclear if such a low level of adhesivity has functional relevance in the intact organism.

as homophilic adhesion is the main function of clustered protocadherins investigated experimentally so far, these results discourage a functional interpretation of the human-specific substitutions and require considering neutral evolution of this locus  <cit> . however, the unremarkable intra-human variability of pcdhb <dig> suggests that there is no mutational hot spot at work, nor have selection constraints on pcdhb <dig> been specially relaxed. no exon of pcdhb <dig> was found to have high levels of biased gene conversion  <cit> . moreover, while gene conversion events in certain human protocadherins have been reported, these events concentrated on the ec <dig> and cytoplasmic domains, sparing the ec1-ec <dig> domains  <cit> . nine of twelve changes in pcdhb <dig> are located in ec <dig> and ec <dig>  and it has been suggested, in a joint analysis of all human protocadherins, that positively selected positions are concentrated in these domains  <cit> . finally, we note that the lack of increased intra-human variability also seems to discourage the hypothesis of diversifying selection.

while some other neutral process may yet explain the high density of human-specific substitutions in pcdhb <dig>  it is also possible that selection might have occurred on an as yet unknown function of human pcdhb <dig>  the subcellular localization of chick α-protocadherins  <cit>  and rodent and primate β-protocadherins  <cit>  was suggested to be incompatible with the commonly assumed homophilic adhesion function. while no data on possible trans-interaction partners of β-protocadherins are available, heterophilic adhesion to integrin has been proposed for murine α-protocadherins  <cit> , and additional intracellular roles distinct from cell adhesion have been suggested for some murine γ-protocadherins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the strategy employed here resulted in the discovery of pcdhb <dig> as a candidate gene for positive selection on the human lineage, combining a high number of potentially relevant substitutions on the human lineage with low intra-human variability. in spite of these genetic results, cell-based tests on the only proposed function for pcdhb <dig> did not indicate a functional change. if the molecular bases of human cognitive capacities can indeed be pinpointed to specific parts of the genome, they may well be discovered in changes affecting expression levels, such as copy number variations or non-coding regulatory sequences.
