BACKGROUND
transcriptomics can vastly improve our understanding of organismal physiology, ecology, and evolution on a large-scale molecular level in both model and non-model systems  <cit> . by comparing abundance of all mrna transcripts present in tissues between distinct physiological states, transcriptomics has the potential to elucidate the myriad genes and pathways driving processes such as development, fasting, and hibernation  <cit> , or responses to environmental change, disease, and other perturbations  <cit> . the fields of stress and conservation physiology especially have much to gain from non-targeted transcriptomics tools, as the molecular bases of organismal responses to altered environmental states and human activity are still not well-understood, especially in wild animals  <cit> .

advancements in sequencing technologies and computational tools are now facilitating sophisticated genomics and transcriptomics studies in non-model organisms  <cit> . while the cost of sequencing is becoming less prohibitive, data analysis remains a challenge for many biologists, mainly due to limited computational resources  <cit> . robust de novo assemblers, data reduction tools, and cloud computing are beginning to make sequencing data analysis more approachable for bench and field scientists  <cit> . despite these improvements, sequence-based resources are still lacking for many non-model species such as marine mammals, hampering molecular understanding of unique adaptations and physiology. only a handful of marine mammal genomes have been sequenced, annotation remains a challenge, and few transcriptomes are available  <cit> .

the northern elephant seal  is one of the most extensively studied pinniped species that has contributed greatly to our understanding of fasting and diving physiology. ease of accessibility and amenability to research manipulations make this animal one of the few marine mammal study systems in which functional physiological experiments are feasible  <cit> . elephant seal life history is characterized by prolonged terrestrial fasts during which animals incur extremely high energy expenditures necessary for breeding and molting  <cit> . fasting metabolism relies almost entirely on lipolysis and is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, making this species a non-traditional model of metabolic syndrome  <cit> . the elephant seal is also a model of oxidative stress tolerance as animals are routinely exposed to hypoxia during deep dives and apnea but do not incur tissue damage due to high antioxidant capacity  <cit> . elevated carbon monoxide levels in the blood may also protect elephant seals from oxidative stress, although the mechanisms for this are currently unknown  <cit> . elucidating the molecular bases of these adaptations can greatly increase our understanding of marine mammal physiology as well as human pathologies related to metabolism and oxidative stress. however, molecular studies in elephant seals have been limited to small subsets of highly conserved genes in the absence of unique genomic information  <cit> . transcriptomics can rapidly generate m. angustirostris-specific reference sequence in the absence of a genome, enabling large-scale gene discovery in physiological and ecological contexts. this approach also facilitates phylogenomic analyses and can improve genome annotation for other marine mammal species  <cit> .

we present a reference transcriptome for m. angustirostris muscle tissue collected from juvenile animals undergoing a stress challenge experiment. stress hormones  released by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis serve an adaptive role in elephant seal physiology by maintaining fasting metabolism and promoting life history transitions  <cit> . however, elevated hpa axis activity in response to environmental disturbance may become pathological, resulting in reduced fecundity and survival, a key conservation issue for species of concern  <cit> . we are interested in understanding the physiological differences between adaptive and maladaptive stress responses. downstream effectors of hpa axis activity are relatively unknown in derived mammals such as phocid seals, hindering development of species-specific molecular tools for studying stress physiology. to address this resource gap, we examined global transcriptional changes in elephant seal muscle, a metabolically active target tissue, in response to an acute stress challenge. we stimulated the hpa axis by administering slow-release adrenocorticotropic hormone  to juvenile seals, which activates endogenous cortisol release and allows sustained stimulation of the hormone axis  <cit> . manipulation and sampling were conducted under dissociative anesthesia to avoid confounds of psychological stress. prior studies have shown this immobilization procedure does not result in activation of the hpa axis  <cit> . tissue samples were collected immediately prior to acth administration and  <dig> and 24 hours post-procedure, representing baseline, acute stress, and stress recovery states. the transcriptome assembly includes samples from all three conditions to capture transcripts expressed during both native and stressed physiological states.

we employed a user-friendly data analysis pipeline  to perform de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation entirely in the cloud  <cit> . we assembled  <dig>  gigabases into  <dig>  transcripts, of which  <dig> % were annotated using mouse, human, and dog reference sequences. this generated  <dig>  annotated transcript families that represent a novel resource for physiological studies in this marine mammal study system. genes in the reference transcriptome that mapped to functional pathways are involved in insulin signaling and lipid metabolism, molecular pathways in cancer, muscle tissue maintenance, and immune response to pathogens. preliminary expression analysis found that transcripts altered during an acute stress response in elephant seals, such as ccaat/enhancer binding protein-δ, are mainly involved in metabolic and immune function. further investigation of the specific transcriptional response to experimental stress manipulation will yield significant insights into molecular underpinnings of organismal stress response and recovery.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembly
muscle tissue for transcriptome sequencing was collected from three juvenile northern elephant seals at three time points during an acute stress challenge experiment: before acth injection , 2 hours after injection , and 24 hours  after injection. libraries from the nine samples were pooled and paired-end sequenced by illumina hiseq  <dig>  generating  <dig> million reads,  <dig>  billion total bases, and  <dig>  gb of data. raw sequencing data were deposited at ncbi sequence read archive under study accession . all data analysis was conducted in the cloud using amazon elastic compute cloud service x-large and 2x-large machines  <cit> . the 2x-large machine, which offers 34 gb of memory, was only used for assembly, while the x-large  was sufficient for all other analysis steps. we used the eel pond mrnaseq protocol, a user-friendly standalone pipeline for complete transcriptome analysis from quality trimming and data normalization, through assembly, annotation, and expression analysis .

raw sequence files were trimmed to remove adapter sequence contamination and low-quality sequences . adapter and quality filtering reduced the amount of data from  <dig>  gb to  <dig>  gb and improved sequence quality scores as determined by fastqc. we found that up to 20% of each paired-end sequence file contained an overrepresented sequence homologous to myoglobin of weddell seal , grey seal , and domestic dog . muscle myoglobin protein content is known to be elevated in phocid seals compared to terrestrial species  <cit> , and here we demonstrate that myoglobin homologs are highly overrepresented in the elephant seal transcriptome.

high-throughput rna sequencing produces a vast amount of data in order to provide sufficient coverage of low-abundance transcripts. this results in significant redundancy of the most abundant transcripts, compounding sequencing errors, complicating assembly, and increasing computing time. digital normalization  removes highly redundant sequences while retaining read complexity and low abundance transcripts  <cit> . this decreases computational memory needed for assembly without losing valuable biological information. a single round of diginorm was applied to trimmed sequencing files, removing  <dig> % of sequence and reducing the total amount of data to  <dig>  gb , which enabled cloud-based assembly in 31 hours.

transcriptome assembly was conducted using trinity, a de bruijn graph-based de novo assembler that has shown high performance in recovering full-length transcripts and splice isoforms  <cit> . trinity assembled  <dig>  gigabases into  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  trinity components  with  <dig>  percent gc content. the mean, median and n <dig> contig lengths were 3117 bp, 2298 bp, and 5501 bp, respectively . the raw assembly is available at http://athyra.ged.msu.edu/~preeyano/seal/mirounga_raw.fa.gz. while the basic assembly statistics provided by trinity are commonly used to estimate assembly quality, they are derived from genome-based metrics that do not take into account uneven sequencing coverage and presence of isoforms  <cit> .table  <dig>

an alternative quality metric is the percentage of raw reads mapping back to the assembly. this provides an estimation of assembly completeness, an important consideration for downstream analyses using the assembly as a scaffold for read mapping and expression analysis  <cit> . we used bowtie  <cit>  to align quality-trimmed reads from all nine samples to the assembly. we found that in all sample reads,  <dig> % of left and  <dig> % of right reads could be mapped back to the assembled transcriptome, with  <dig> % proper pairs mapped for a representative sample. unmapped sequences may represent poor quality reads, incomplete transcripts, or read orphans.

transcriptome assemblies vary widely by sequencing platform, read length, coverage, and assembly method, so there is still little consensus on what constitutes a “high-quality” de novo assembly. it has been suggested that annotation-based metrics are most informative as they estimate the number of real genes that can be recovered from the assembly  <cit> .

transcriptome annotation
we annotated the elephant seal transcriptome by searching for best blast hits  and reciprocal best hits  between elephant seal and mouse , human , and dog  protein sequences. mouse sequence was used for continuity in the eel pond mrnaseq protocol and to obtain entrez gene ids for pathway analysis. human protein sequence was used for annotation due to its completeness. dog protein sequence was used to identify carnivore-specific genes that are not represented in mouse or human genomes  <cit> .

annotation using mouse sequence produced a total of  <dig>   annotated transcripts in  <dig>  annotated transcript families. we found  <dig>  and  <dig>  m. angustirostris orthologs and homologs of mouse genes, respectively . the transcriptome assembly containing mouse annotation with percent orthology/homology for each gene is available as . annotation using human reference sequence produced a total of  <dig>   annotated transcripts in  <dig>  transcript families. we found  <dig>  seal orthologs and  <dig>  seal homologs of human genes . the most complete annotation was produced using dog reference sequence, with  <dig>   total annotated sequences in  <dig>  transcript families . we found  <dig>  seal orthologs and  <dig>  homologs of dog genes;  <dig>  orthologs and  <dig>  homologs were unique to dog and not found in the mouse or human annotations . however, many hits to dog sequences were in poorly annotated genome regions.table  <dig>

the majority of annotated genes were common in mouse, dog, and human datasets . we found only  <dig>  and  <dig>  orthologs that were unique to mouse and human, respectively;  <dig>  homologs were mouse-specific and  <dig>  were human-specific . we combined the three annotations to produce a total of  <dig>   annotated sequences in  <dig>  transcript families, with  <dig>  m. angustirostris orthologs and  <dig>  homologs of mouse, dog, and human genes .

transcriptome filtering
our assembly produced a vast number of transcripts , a common issue with de novo assemblers. trinity is especially known for high sensitivity to isoforms  <cit> . we found that  <dig>   transcript families contained more than  <dig> members, with the largest family containing  <dig>  isoforms. isoform overabundance may be due to transcript fragmentation or chimeras created by assembly, and/or complex alternative splicing and high polymorphism common in large vertebrates. therefore, some isoforms may be assembly artifacts that are not biologically significant  <cit> .

to enable downstream phylogenomic and other analyses, we collapsed gene families that contained more than  <dig> isoforms by cd-hit  <cit>  clustering with > 95% similarity cutoff followed by removal of redundant transcripts. only the representative transcript in each cluster was retained. this approach removed  <dig> % of redundant isoforms in large gene families, reducing the total number of assembled transcripts from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the minimum and maximum number of isoforms remaining in filtered families were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. we did not apply a more stringent similarity cutoff as it could result in loss of true splice isoforms. the filtered assembly is available at http://athyra.ged.msu.edu/~preeyano/seal/mirounga_filtered.fa.gz. we provide both the raw and filtered assembly as filtering may remove true splice isoforms  <cit> . therefore, the raw assembly may provide vital information on rare transcripts and novel splice isoforms that may be lost during filtering.

functional annotation
to infer biological function of annotated m. angustirostris genes in the muscle transcriptome, we searched for gene ontology  terms in  <dig>  gene families that included orthologs and homologs of mouse proteins. we found that  <dig>  genes were associated with biological processes and  <dig>  with molecular functions . of the genes that were associated with a cellular component,  <dig>  encoded cytoplasmic proteins,  <dig>  encoded nuclear proteins, and  <dig>  encoded membrane proteins . top molecular functions included binding to proteins , metal ions , and nucleotides , and transferase , hydrolase , and kinase  activities . top biological process categories included transcriptional regulation , transport , signal transduction , organismal development , and metabolic processes .figure  <dig>

to identify specific metabolic and signaling pathways encoded in the transcriptome, we mapped mouse-annotated m. angustirostris genes to kegg pathways  <cit> . the most highly enriched pathways are involved in metabolism , cancer , mapk signaling , focal adhesion , and actin cytoskeleton regulation . enriched pathways also include those involved in immunity  and response to pathogens .figure  <dig>

m. angustirostris transcripts were mapped to specific metabolic pathways that include insulin signaling pathway and type ii diabetes mellitus, citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, adipocytokine signaling, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis . gene sequences that may be of interest to further elephant seal molecular physiology studies include insulin receptor substrate, resistin, hormone-sensitive lipase, thyroid hormone receptor, nitric oxide synthase, heme oxygenase, hypoxia-inducible factor, xanthine oxidase, and superoxide dismutase, among thousands of others.

preliminary differential expression analysis
to identify molecular pathways altered in response to an acute stress challenge in m. angustirostris, we compared gene expression profiles in libraries from muscle tissue of the three animals before and after acth injection. quality-trimmed reads were mapped to the transcriptome assembly using bowtie. digital gene expression analysis was conducted using rsem  <cit>  followed by ebseq  <cit> . we found that  <dig>  transcripts were differentially expressed between 0 hr and 2 hr conditions  at adjusted p-value <  <dig>  and false discovery rate  of  <dig>  . of these, only  <dig> transcripts were upregulated or downregulated by at least twofold. comparison of 2 hr and 24 hr conditions  identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes , of which  <dig> were up- or downregulated by at least twofold . we searched for go biological process categories that were enriched in the differential expression datasets at p <  <dig> . genes altered within 2 hours of acth administration are predominantly involved in transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, and metabolic signaling . transcripts altered during stress recovery mapped to categories such as insulin signaling, muscle tissue development and homeostasis . this preliminary expression analysis suggests that elephant seal muscle tissue is robust to perturbation and may respond to acute stressors by transiently altering metabolic and tissue remodeling processes.figure  <dig>

cellular responses to acute stress
in response to hpa axis activation, circulating glucocorticoids bind to receptors in target tissues, which subsequently translocate to the nucleus and serve as transcription factors to influence gene expression. a number of direct glucocorticoid target genes have been identified in skeletal muscle, which include factors that oppose insulin signaling and promote protein catabolism to meet increased energy demands  <cit> . however, glucocorticoid-induced gene expression has not been extensively studied during acute stress in an in vivo, non-pathological context. we found that the most highly upregulated transcript in elephant seal muscle tissue two hours after acth administration was ccaat/enhancer binding protein-δ , a transcription factor transiently induced by glucocorticoids in other systems. cebpd plays a role in a number of cell processes such as inflammation, cell death and survival, and proteolysis via upregulation of atrogenes  <cit> . therefore, cebpd is likely an important early regulator of cellular responses to hpa axis activation in elephant seal muscle, and a potential molecular marker of acute stress in this and other marine mammal systems. interestingly, despite elevation in baseline cortisol over extended fasting periods, elephant seals efficiently spare protein, suggesting that negative feedback mechanisms may operate to suppress glucocorticoids’ proteolytic effects  <cit> . the transcriptome resource presented here is likely to yield insights on such regulatory mechanisms and will provide a unique molecular resolution of a coordinated stress response in vivo in a free-ranging marine mammal study system.

CONCLUSIONS
we generated the first reference sequence for mirounga angustirostris by rna sequencing of muscle tissue and cloud-based de novo transcriptome assembly. we annotated  <dig>  m. angustirostris transcripts  and have identified thousands of genes involved in key physiological processes such as metabolism, immune response to pathogens, muscle tissue maintenance, and stress. unannotated transcripts may represent putative novel m. angustirostris-specific genes and splice isoforms. this resource provides elephant seal-specific gene sequences, complementing existing metabolite and protein expression studies and enabling future work on molecular pathways regulating adaptations such as fasting, hypoxia, and stress tolerance in muscle tissue. transcriptional response of muscle to acute stress is limited and may involve alterations in metabolic and immune signaling and muscle tissue maintenance via transcriptional regulators such as cebpd.
