BACKGROUND
development of an oral antigens  delivery system for mucosal vaccine is a meaningful challenge for pharmaceutical scientists. the instability and poor absorption of antigens in gastrointestinal tract is major obstacles in the development of oral antigen delivery system for mucosal vaccine. problems such as acid degradation in stomach, poor permeability across the gastrointestinal mucosa and the first-pass metabolism greatly limited the uptake of antigens by m-cell which is very important step for immune response  <cit> . to overcome the above-mentioned obstacles, several strategies, including liposomes  <cit> , micro/nanoparticles  <cit> , micro/nanoemulsion  <cit> , and etc, have been explored to encapsulate antigens for the mucosal vaccine. among these strategies, micro/nanoparticles made of biodegradable natural polymer have gained considerable interest in the past decades. one important aspect is that some natural polymers, especially chitosan, haves been demonstrated that could enhance the immunogenicity of poor immune response antigens in the form of solution and micro/nanoparticles  <cit> .

chitosan, as a cationic polysaccharide, has gained increasing attention in pharmaceutical field due to its favorable biological properties, such as non-toxicity, biodegradability  <cit> , mucoadhesive properties  <cit> , and etc. additionally, chitosan micro/nanoparticles can be easily prepared by ionic gelation method using tripolyphosphate  as precipitating agent  <cit> . the advantage of this method was attributed to the mild condition without the application of harmful organic solvent at room temperature in the procedure, and also could efficiently detain the bioactivity of macromolecules  during the encapsulation. in spite of all its superior properties, chitosan has an apparent pka of  <dig>  and is only soluble in acidic solutions. when incubated in physiological fluid environment, chitosan will lose its capacity of mucoadhesive properties and permeation enhancing effect due to the deprotonation of chitosan, which would make chitosan carriers lose its advantage compared with other carriers for mucosal vaccine. meanwhile, chitosan has limited ability for controlling the release of encapsulated macromolecule compounds because of its hydrophilic nature and easy solubility in acidic medium  <cit> . it might be an interesting method to overcome these obstacles by coating acid-resistant polymer, such as alginate sodium, onto the surface of chitosan microparticles. as an anionic polysaccharide with favorable biological properties, alginate can easily interact with cationic chitosan microparticles to form the polyelectrolyte complex via electrostatic interactions  <cit> . additionally, this coating procedure was performed at relatively mild condition without using any organic solvent. this relatively mild process has enabled not only proteins, but cells and dna to be incorporated into the chitosan/alginate matrices with retention of biological activity  <cit> .

in this work, we hope to develop a novel oral antigen carrier based on alginate coated chitosan microparticles to meet the requirement of mucosal vaccine. model protein  was adopted to evaluate the properties of alginate coated chitosan microparticles. in vitro release behavior of bsa from chitosan microparticles and the stability of bsa loaded chitosan microparticles against acidic condition could be modified by alginate coating layer.

RESULTS
preparation of alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles
in this article, we prepared alginate coated chitosan microparticles by layer-by-layer technology to meet the requirement of oral administration of antigen for mucosal vaccine. bsa with isoelectric point  of  <dig>  was negatively charged when ph> <dig> , which could easily absorb cationic chitosan microparticle at aqueous solution  via electrostatic interaction and was selected as the model protein to evaluate the properties of alginate coated chitosan microparticles. this procedure could be divided into three parts, preparation of the chitosan microparticles, loading of bsa onto chitosan microparticles, and finally coating of bsa loaded chitosan microparticles with sodium alginate. chitosan microparticles were prepared by ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate  as precipitating agent that has been described by several authors  <cit> . according to table  <dig>  the mean particle size of prepared chitosan microparticles was about  <dig> nm and the pdi was  <dig> . then, chitosan microparticles were incubated in aqueous solution with different bsa concentrations at a relatively mild condition to obtain suitable loading efficiency  and loading capacity . finally, alginate was introduced to coat onto surface of bsa loaded chitosan microparticles to increase the acidic resistance of bsa loaded chitosan microparticles and to modulate the release behavior of bsa from chitosan microparticles  <cit> . effect of alginate/chitosan microparticles weight ratio on the properties of microparticles was presented in table  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  we could find that stable alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles could be obtained when the weight ratio of alginate/chitosan microparticles was greater than  <dig>  it might be explained by the fact that the addition of small amount of alginate  to chitosan microparticles decreased the zeta potential of microparticles and could facilitate the gelation of chitosan and alginate resulting in agglomeration or precipitation  <cit> . meanwhile, when the weight ratio of alginate/chitosan microparticles was greater than  <dig>  the rapid charge inversion and gelation lead to the formation of stable chitosan microparticles. calcium ion  was used as crosslinking agent to strengthen and stabilize the particles  <cit> .

procedure of protein loading
effect of bsa concentration
cationic microparticles can easily absorb anionic protein or dna via electrostatic interaction  <cit> . cationic chitosan microparticles prepared in this work had a potent capacity to absorb the model anionic protein  in aqueous solution via electrostatic interaction. the obtained chitosan microparticles at concentration of  <dig> mg/ml were adopted to evaluate particle size, zeta potential, loading efficiency, and loading capacity of alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles. as presented in table  <dig>  effect of bsa concentration on the properties of chitosan microparticle were investigated. the mean diameter of chitosan microparticles increased accompanied with decrease in zeta potential when bsa concentration increased from  <dig> mg/ml to  <dig> mg/ml. this might be attributed to the fact that negatively charged bsa absorbed onto chitosan microparticles and neutralized part of zeta potential of chitosan microparticles resulted in increase of particle size and decrease of zeta potential  <cit> . fig.  <dig> depicts the effect of bsa concentration on the loading efficiency  and loading capacity  of chitosan microparticles. when the concentration of bsa was lower than  <dig> mg/ml, the loading efficiency was greater than 60%. the loading efficiency significantly decreased to about  <dig> % while bsa concentration was greater than  <dig> mg/ml. this interesting phenomenon might be attributed to the saturated absorption was achieved as bsa concentration at about  <dig> mg/ml, the more addition of bsa was seldom adsorbed onto chitosan microparticles which leaded to the great decrease in loading efficiency . meanwhile, loading capacity increased from 10% to 40% as the bsa concentration increased from  <dig> mg/ml to  <dig> mg/ml.

effect of alginate/chitosan microparticles weight ratio
due to the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged -nh3+ of chitosan microparticles and negatively charged -coo- of alginate, cationic bsa-loaded chitosan microparticles could be easily modified with anionic alginate in aqueous solution via electrostatic interaction  <cit> . however, the addition of anionic alginate to cationic bsa loaded chitosan microparticles would replace some of bsa absorption on the chitosan microparticles due to the competitive electronic interaction  <cit> . according to fig.  <dig>  we could find that the loading efficiency  of bsa on chitosan microparticles increased with decrease in alginate/chitosan microparticles weight ratio until the mass ratio of alginate/chitosan microparticles was smaller than  <dig>  but the precipitation of chitosan microparticles was also observed. the zeta potential of colloidal chitosan microparticles is an important factor for the stability of particles. generally, the higher zeta potential of particles led to more stability of colloidal particles, and the lower zeta potential of particles induced agglomeration of colloidal particles  <cit> . the observed precipitation of system was probably caused by the decrease in zeta potential  and the gelation of chitosan with addition of alginate. as the precipitation proceeded, the higher le was observed which might be attributed to co-precipitation of bsa because of the gelation of chitosan and alginate. however, stable colloidal microparticle system  could be obtained when the weight ratio of alginate/chitosan microparticles was greater than  <dig>  which might be explained by that the rapid charge inversion and coating process of microparticles  leading to the stable system formed. however, the loading efficiency  and loading capacity  of bsa on chitosan microparticles decreased due to the competitive adsorption between alginate and bsa resulting in some bsa desorption from chitosan microparticles  <cit> .

characterization of chitosan microparticles
the obtained chitosan microparticles and alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles were characterized by sem and laser diffraction. two typical scanning electron microphotographs of chitosan microparticles and alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles were presented in fig.  <dig>  respectively. according to fig.  <dig>  chitosan microparticles were almost irregular spherical with size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nm. it was also observed that some small chitosan microparticles fused into large ones. the result detected by malvern instrument indicated that the average size of chitosan microparticles was about  <dig> nm and zeta potential was + <dig>  mv . the size distribution of chitosan microparticles was presented in fig.  <dig>  which indicated that well dispersed chitosan microparticles were prepared. as shown in fig.  <dig>  sem photograph of alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles show that the mean size of microparticles was about  <dig> μm which was larger than bsa loaded chitosan microparticles due to the coating microparticles with alginate and the morphology of alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles was shown to have core-shell structure which indicated that the sodium alginate was successfully coated on the surface of bsa loaded chitosan microparticles core. here, we also found that some particles were adhered together. the size distribution of alginate coated bsa loaded chitosan microparticles was presented in fig.  <dig>  during the coating procedure, the inversion of the zeta potential was observed by the malvern instrument. after complete coating of alginate on chitosan microparticles core, the zeta potential of chitosan microparticles was about - <dig>  mv , which also implied the presence of alginate layer on the surface of chitosan microparticles.

protein release in vitro
the release profiles of bsa from uncoated and alginate coated chitosan microparticles at phosphate buffer  were shown in fig.  <dig>  as depicted in fig.  <dig>  the initial burst release  of bsa from uncoated chitosan microparticles occurred in the first  <dig>  h, followed by release of  <dig> % in  <dig> days. the burst release might be attributed to the fact that bsa macromolecules were loosely bound onto chitosan microparticles by ionic interaction which could be easily desorbed at ionic environment  <cit> . however, alginate modified chitosan microparticle could increase the stability of chitosan microparticles in the pbs at 37°c which resulted in extended release of bsa, only about 40% of bsa released in  <dig> h. and  <dig> h later, there was still about 50% of bsa retained in the alginate coated chitosan microparticles. the total ratio of bsa released from the alginate coated chitosan microparticles in  <dig> h was much less than that observed from uncoated chitosan microparticles. the longer release time and slower release rate of bsa from alginate coated chitosan microparticles might be explained by that there are strong interaction between polymers  and bsa  <cit> . additionally, the presence of alginate layer could slow down the diffusion of bsa from the system which also prolong the release time of bsa from system. but, due to both the degradation and erosion of matrix, the bsa might be released from the alginate/bsa/chitosan formulation in an extended profile  <cit> . this release behavior studies indicated that coating of alginate onto chitosan microparticles could improve the stability of chitosan microparticles in pbs and modify the release behavior of bsa from these alginate coated chitosan microparticles.

acidic degradation protection
in this paper, we hope to design an oral antigens delivery system for mucosal vaccine. as we know, ph value of gastric fluid is approximately  <dig> which will destroy the integrity and structure of antigens  after the oral administration without any protection. therefore, it is very important for us to develop an antigen carrier based on chitosan and alginate that can effectively avoid the acidic degradation of encapsulated antigen before it reached the target site. here, bsa released from uncoated and alginate coated chitosan microparticles under acidic medium  and pbs medium  was analyzed by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . according to fig.  <dig>  molecular weight marker was shown in lane  <dig>  and the bsa incubated with pbs  for  <dig> h exhibited a clear band at about  <dig> kd . however, bsa pretreated with  <dig>  m hcl for  <dig> h then incubated with pbs for  <dig> h had a faint band at  <dig> kd  which indicated the serious degradation or hydrolysis of bsa in acidic medium. the sds-page gel banding patterns of bsa released from uncoated and alginate coated chitosan microparticles with hcl  pretreatment for  <dig> h and then sustained release in pbs for  <dig> h are shown in lane  <dig> and lane  <dig>  respectively. it is seen that bsa from uncoated chitosan microparticles had a very weak band at  <dig> kd  which indicated that the bsa underwent hydrolysis/degradation in spite of presence of chitosan microparticles . meanwhile, we also observed the flocculent precipitate of system with the addition of sodium hydrate to bsa loaded chitosan microparticles which implied the dissolution of chitosan microparticles in acidic condition . however, bsa from alginate coated chitosan microparticles had a clear band at about  <dig> kd , which implied that alginate coating of chitosan microparticles could effectively protect bsa from hydrolysis/degradation at acidic medium for at least  <dig> h. so, the obtained alginate coated chitosan microparticles might be an effective oral antigenic carrier for mucosal vaccine

fourier transform infra-red  measurements
stability of alginate coated chitosan microparticles in pbs was investigated using ftir spectroscopy. according to fig.  <dig>  alginate coated chitosan microparticles at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of release test showed similar spectra. the peaks at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig> were due to the stretching of o-h, coo-, coo-, and c-o-c, respectively. compared with ftir spectrum of alginate modified chitosan microparticles at  <dig> h of release test, the shift of coo- peaks at  <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig> to higher wavenumber , as well as the decrease in intensity, was observed in alginate modified chitosan microparticles at  <dig> h of release test in pbs, which indicated that ionic desorption between coo- of alginate and calcium ions or nh3+ of chitosan was occurred at  <dig> h of release test  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the prepared alginate coated chitosan microparticles, with mean diameter of about  <dig> μm, was suitable for oral administration. moreover, alginate coating onto surface of chitosan microparticles could modulate the release behavior of bsa from alginate coated chitosan microparticles and could effectively protect model protein  from degradation against acidic medium  in vitro at least for  <dig> hours. according to ftir, some alginate on surface of chitosan microparticles at  <dig> h of release test has been dissolved into pbs. based on the information demonstrated, the prepared alginate coated chitosan microparticles might be an effective vehicle for oral administration of antigens.
