BACKGROUND
rainbow trout  are widely distributed fish species cultured in regions with cold and cool water temperatures around the world. they are important food and sport fish and the most cultivated cold freshwater fish in the us  <cit> . in addition, rainbow trout is one of the most rigorously studied fishes in many research areas including carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology and nutrition. for over a century, rainbow trout has been used as a model research species; more is known about the biology of rainbow trout than any other fish species. rainbow trout is a member of the salmonidae family. during the last decade more than  <dig>  scientific papers have been published on salmonids. rainbow trout can also serve as a surrogate for research needed on other economically important salmonid species such as atlantic and pacific salmon and char species  <cit> . this wealth of knowledge and interest in rainbow trout has guided increased attention to developing and using genomics tools, as evidenced by the considerable accumulation of genomic resources in recent years from several groups around the world  <cit> . however, the rainbow trout genome sequence is not available yet, and this lack of information hinders the contemporary approaches to identification/characterization of important genes and genetic markers for aquaculture applications and biomedical research. until the reference genome sequence becomes available, transcriptome sequencing is a fast and efficient means for gene discovery and genetic marker development. transcriptome sequencing enables functional genomics studies including global gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery, quantitative trait loci analysis and genome scans of diversity  <cit> . rainbow trout is a significant fish model in terms of expressed sequence tags   <cit> . international large-scale est sequencing projects for rainbow trout have generated large number of ests  that are publicly available through the rainbow trout gene index database  <cit> .

as a member of the family salmonidae, rainbow trout has descended from a tetraploid ancestor <cit> . a whole genome duplication event occurred 25- <dig> mya and the genome is estimated to be 1/ <dig> of the way toward re-diploidization  <cit> . about 50% of protein-coding loci examined in salmonid species show duplicate gene expression  <cit> . the nature of duplicated rainbow trout genome hinders assembly and complicates annotation of the est sequences as well as identification of snps  <cit> . attempts to assemble and annotate the rainbow trout ests yielded  <dig>  tentative consensus  sequences,  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> . previous efforts aimed at snp discovery for rainbow trout using ests were unsuccessful, mainly, due to difficulties parsing allelic variation from the high frequency of duplicated genes  <cit> . to better characterize the rainbow trout transcriptome and improve discovery of allelic variations, a haploid transcriptome sequence is needed. doubled haploid clonal lines, fish that have two identical copies of each chromosome, were established in salmonids, using androgenesis and gynogenesis; whole chromosome set manipulation techniques  <cit> . in androgenesis, eggs are gamma-irradiated to destroy dna and then fertilized with untreated sperm. then, a temperature or pressure shock is used to interrupt mitosis, resulting in completely homozygous doubled haploid fish. similarly, in gynogenesis, sperm are treated with ultraviolet radiation to induce development of untreated eggs before the temperature or pressure shock treatment. to create a clonal line, completely homozygous and identical doubled haploid, population, a single homozygous fish is reproduced through a second generation of chromosome set manipulation  <cit> .

recently, 454-pyrosequencing has become relatively rapid and cost-effective method for sequencing with progressively increasing depth and coverage. therefore, it is a very suitable technique for de novo transcriptome sequencing for non-model species such as rainbow trout  <cit> . the objectives of this study were to: 1) sequence and characterize the transcriptome of an individual from the swanson doubled haploid rainbow trout clonal line using 454-pyrosequencing to produce a transcriptome reference sequence for identification of gene duplications, distinguishing true/false snps and future genomic/transcriptomic sequencing; and 2) use the 454-pyrosequencing and the sanger-based est data to characterize the rainbow trout transcriptome with improved assembly and annotation for digital gene expression and proteomic research in the future.

RESULTS
sanger-based sequencing of the rainbow trout transcriptome
in the last few years, large-scale est sequencing projects for rainbow trout have been undertaken in several laboratories worldwide. rise and coworkers reported  <dig>  ests  from  <dig> rainbow trout cdna libraries  <cit> . govoroun and coworkers reported a total of  <dig>  ests sequenced from three normalized and subtracted cdna libraries including one highly complex pooled-tissue library from  <dig> different tissues  <cit> . a substantial number of ests were generated in our labs, currently representing 47% of the total number of available rainbow trout sequences    <cit> . over  <dig>  of these ests were sequenced from a normalized library constructed from mrna pooled from several tissues including; muscle, brain, gill, spleen, liver, kidney and juvenile tissues  <cit> . the normalization and pooling strategies were used to increase probability of identifying unique and diverse set transcripts. clones were randomly picked and sequenced until library sequencing is saturated; low probability of discovering a new mrna reached due to the redundancy effect. collectively, the international efforts of sequencing the rainbow trout transcriptome have thus far generated  <dig>  ests that are publicly available through the genbank  <cit> . table  <dig> shows summary statistics of the major rainbow trout est projects listed in the rainbow trout gene index database  <cit> . in this database, all est sequence data were integrated and assembled producing  <dig>  total unique sequences  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  ests  were clustered in  <dig>  tcs and  <dig>  ests  were singletons. there is an average of  <dig>  est per tc   <cit> . most of the sequences were derived from 5'- or 3'-sequencing and thus are less likely to cover coding regions, which hinders the est annotations. table  <dig> shows summary statistics of the sanger-based ests assembly compared to the below-mentioned de novo assembly of the 454-pyrosequencing and a combination assembly of both datasets.

data from the national center for cool and cold water aquaculture  and the national institute for agricultural research  constitute 47% and 37%, respectively.

454-pyrosequencing of the rainbow trout transcriptome
a 454-pyrosequencing library was constructed from  <dig> tissues collected from a single immature male homozygous doubled-haploid fish from the swanson clonal line, the same line used for bac library construction . the  <dig> library was titrated in three one-sixteenth-plate regions to determine the optimal bead library concentration. after titration, the library was sequenced in two half-plate regions of a picotiterplate. great wealth of sequence data were obtained from the pyrosequencing runs, yielding six times more sequence data than all the currently available sanger-based data. a total of  <dig> , <dig> ests  and  <dig> million bases were obtained from 454-pyrosequencing. the primary sequence data were deposited in genbank short read archive  under accession number sra <dig> . of these,  <dig> , <dig>  passed quality standards .

sequences that passed quality standards were clustered and de novo assembled. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were integrated into  <dig>  tcs leaving  <dig>  singletons; yielding a total of  <dig>  unique sequences . the de novo assembly sequence data were deposited in the transcriptome shotgun assembly  database with the accession numbers ez763335-ez <dig>  the percentage of the assembled 454-pyrosequencing sequence reads was 83% compared to 81% of the sanger-based est data. the average length of the 454-pyrosequencing tcs was  <dig> bp, compared to  <dig> bp of the sanger-based data. distribution of 454-assembly showed a wide range of contig lengths with most contigs ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> bp . the number of contigs larger than  <dig> bp was  <dig>  . de novo assembly of pyrosequencing transcriptomic data from other non-model species yielded 25-88% ests assembled into contigs of average length 197- <dig> bp  <cit> . successful assembly of rainbow trout pyrosequencing data into relatively long contigs is apparently due to the length of the individual reads and/or thorough coverage of the transcriptome.

the 454-pyrosequencing data were generated and assembled from a doubled-haploid rainbow trout clonal line to address problems associated with the nature of the rainbow trout duplicated genome that hinders assembly and complicates annotation  <cit> . the 454-pyrosequencing data were assembled to serve as a reference sequence for future studies to identify gene duplications from allelic variations and to distinguish true/false snps. sequence data were de novo assembled using the default parameters of the seqman ngen software .

the 454-pyrosequencing library identified large number of new genes. a total of  <dig>  gene transcripts were identified by subtracting the sanger-based sequences from the 454-pyrosequencing sequence data. the subtraction was done by using blastn with an e-value below 1e- <dig>  an alignment longer than  <dig> bp and 95% sequence identity within the aligned region .

a combination of both the 454-pyrosequencing ests and the sanger-based sequences offered the maximum amount of genetic information available for rainbow trout so far;  <dig> m bp,  <dig> , <dig> ests and  <dig>  unique sequences . the combination assembly sequence data are available at the nagrp aquaculture genome projects  <cit> . with estimates of  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp genome size of the rainbow trout and 1% of the genome being mrnas, the combined data provide an estimated 19× depth of coverage of the rainbow trout transcriptome  <cit> . the combination assembly increased the number of tcs to  <dig>   leaving  <dig>  singletons. a comparison of the percentage of the assembled reads in the combination assembly  to the 454-pyrosequencing and the sanger-based assemblies  indicates that combining the two sequence data did not improve the assembly percentage of each individual sequence dataset .

functional annotation and gene ontology analyses
functional annotation of transcripts of the combination assembly was carried out by blastx search against the ncbi non-redundant protein database using the blast2go suite  <cit> . blast result accessions were used to retrieve associated gene names and gene ontology  terms. gene ontology is widely used to standardize representation of genes across species and provides a controlled vocabulary of terms for describing gene product  <cit> . biological processes constituted the largest class of go assignment of the transcripts , followed by cellular components  and molecular function . level  <dig> go assignments within the three categories are summarized in figure  <dig>  of the biological process categories, 25% of the genes are associated with cellular processes and 25% are related to regulation of biological process. within the molecular functional category, 46% are related to protein binding followed by 32% catalytic activity. of the cellular components, 59% of the genes are related to the cell and 24% were related to organelles.

a blastx top-hit species distribution of gene annotations showed highest homology to zebrafish , followed by atlantic salmon  and puffer fish  . in addition, the trout sequences had significant homologies to four more fish species including japanese pufferfish , rainbow smelt , northern pike  and european plaice . these results indicate a high level of phylogenetic conservation of the rainbow trout gene content compared to these fish species. on the other hand, the model fish species medaka fish  and stickleback fish  showed very low homology to the trout sequences. it is worth mentioning that only  <dig> % of the blastx top-hits matched rainbow trout protein sequences. this may be explained on the basis of the limited number of the rainbow trout proteins  that are currently available in the ncbi database compared to other fish species with known genome sequences  and suggests identification of large number of new genes by the 454-pyrosequencing library  <cit> . the results of blastx top-hit of fish species are provided in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

based on the blastx top-hit species distribution of gene annotations, zebrafish was chosen for a detailed gene ontology comparison . distribution profile and percentage of clustered 2nd level gene ontology terms of the combination assembly showed high similarity to that of the zebrafish suggesting an unbiased representation of the combination assembly to the rainbow trout transcriptome. similarities of the rainbow trout and zebrafish transcripts as indicated by distributions of clusters of different categories of the biological processes, cellular components and molecular functional implies that the combination assembly represents the rainbow trout tissue complexity and that normalization of the 454-pyrosequencing pooled-tissue library and the sanger-based sequences were effective in reducing redundancy .

CONCLUSIONS
a hybrid approach of the high throughput 454-pyrosequencing together with the traditional sanger-based sequences was used to generate high-quality draft assemblies of the rainbow trout transcriptome. the 454-pyrosequencing data were generated and assembled from a swanson doubled-haploid rainbow trout individual to address problems associated with the nature of the rainbow trout duplicated genome; to serves as a reference sequence for future studies to identify gene duplications from allelic variations and to distinguish true/false snps.

the 454-pyrosequencing yielded a great wealth of sequence data. assembly of the 454-pyrosequencing data together with the sanger-based est sequencing data provides 19× depth of coverage of the rainbow trout transcriptome, allowing robust functional annotation and gene ontology designation of the rainbow trout transcripts, and providing a reference sequence for digital gene expression, proteomic studies and qtl mapping.

while the released assembly sequences significantly increased the suite of transcriptome sequences available for rainbow trout that enables functional genome research, next-generation sequence assemblies may contain incorrectly assembled contigs, special attention should be given to this fact.
