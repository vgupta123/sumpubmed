BACKGROUND
advances in both genetic and behavioral techniques are providing unprecedented opportunities for dissecting the gene networks governing behavior. through a variety of approaches, promising candidate genes have been identified for a wide collection of clinically relevant traits such as anxiety, conditional fear and spatial memory  <cit> . intercrosses and backcrosses have been widely used to identify behavior quantitative trait loci  in mice, but suffer from poor mapping resolution. more recently, the use of outbred mice has allowed fine mapping of a range of biological  <cit>  and expression traits  <cit> . however, outbred mice are a fleeting resource and must be regenotyped and re-phenotyped for each study.

in spite of many successes, the recent wave of genome-wide association studies paints an increasingly complex picture of genes underlying behavioral traits. the genetic architecture of most behaviors is widely distributed, with collections of independent loci making relatively small contributions to overall trait variability  <cit> . the largely undefined and likely complex contribution of environmental factors to both the etiology and maintenance of behavior represents another formidable obstacle to reliable qtl mapping.

recent work has achieved superior resolution using panels of inbred mouse lines  <cit> . power can be further improved by incorporating recombinant inbred  strains formed by crossing classical inbred strains followed by repeated sibling mating. one such resource is the hybrid mouse diversity panel  which combines inbred and ri lines to create a panel of  <dig> strains with great resolution and statistical power  <cit> . the hmdp consists of  <dig> classical inbred strains supplemented with  <dig> ri strains derived from c57bl/6j crossed with either dba/2j, a/j or c3h/hej. in addition to enhanced resolution, there are other significant advantages to using the hmdp for genetic mapping. each strain has been genotyped extensively  <cit> , and multiple individuals can be phenotyped for the same trait, reducing measurement variability. furthermore, the panel is a renewable resource, since each strain can be propagated indefinitely  <cit> . phenotype data can be pooled and shared in an ongoing fashion, while the effects of environmental variables are easily studied.

to leverage these emerging resources, we employed an integrative systems approach to explore the genetics of conditional fear. figure  <dig> illustrates the sources of data we collect and how we investigate relationships to identify genetic pathways implicated in the predisposition to fear. mice were phenotyped on a fear conditioning assay, and the quantitative data combined with single nucleotide polymorphism  genotypes to map behavioral quantitative trait loci . we corrected for the confounding effects of relatedness and population structure between strains using efficient mixed model association   <cit> . by combining genome-wide expression qtl  maps for hippocampus and striatum, weighted gene correlation network analysis   <cit> , and structural equation modeling, we identified single genes and pathways with relationships to fear-driven behavioral phenotypes.

RESULTS
to identify regions of the genome associated with fear-related behavior, mice from the hmdp were subjected to a fear conditioning procedure and characterized on  <dig> unique behavioral phenotypes drawn from different test phases. using these phenotypes as quantitative traits, we performed a genome-wide association study  to identify loci associated with each of the behavioral traits.

cued and context fear phenotyping
mice were tested for cued and contextual fear acquired through a pavlovian conditioning procedure. such fear memories manifest across a variety of behavioral dimensions and can be collectively quantified through the use of automated tracking and analysis  <cit> .

immobility  is a classical measure of fear triggered by an environmental threat. this species-specific defense response can be reliably acquired in a single conditioning trial, making it a widely used model for fear expression and learning and memory. we also monitored other measures of fear including velocity, thigmotaxis , path shape, and habituation. the fear conditioning assay is depicted schematically in figure 2a. on day one, a mouse is placed in a cage where an auditory conditional stimulus  tone is played for fifteen seconds followed by a brief foot shock. training consisted of three tone-shock pairings. the next day, the mouse returned to the same chamber and contextual fear is indexed through a collection of behavioral endpoints including immobility. on the third day, the mouse is placed in a novel chamber and given a series of cs presentations with no foot shock. cued fear is quantified across the same behavioral endpoints used to assess contextual fear.

variability in freezing across the panel is shown in figure 2b. further testing details for each of the behavioral phenotypes  are provided in additional file  <dig> . a cluster dendrogram depicting the similarity between the quantitative behavioral phenotypes across the hmdp is shown in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  surprisingly, context and cue immobility measures clustered closely together although they index different types of learning.

mapping of conditional fear qtls
we mapped loci for behavioral phenotypes using emma and  <dig>  snps . across  <dig> measured behavioral phenotypes, qtl analysis revealed  <dig> loci with a p value <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  corresponding to a genome-wide false discovery rate  of 5%. this threshold value is comparable to that from another study using the same panel  <cit> , which employed permutation testing to calculate a genome-wide significance threshold of p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> or a family-wise error rate of  <dig> . qtl plots for the entire battery of behavioral endpoints are in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  the significant loci and corresponding closest genes are summarized in table  <dig> 

we mapped a highly significant qtl on chromosome  <dig> for cued immobility . there are two peak markers for this locus, located ~ <dig> kb apart and residing in different linkage disequilibrium blocks . one peak marker is located within the tyrosinase  gene. since the hmdp is composed of inbred mouse strains, a number are homozygous for a recessive mutation in tyr leading to an albino coat color .

one study looked directly at the effects of tyr on cue dependent freezing behavior  <cit>  using both b <dig> mice with a mutant tyr allele and an aj congenic strain with the wildtype b <dig> allele substituted for the albino tyr allele. tyr had only a small influence on fear learning with only minor  learning deficits due to reduced visual acuity  <cit>  and was one of likely many alleles influencing this phenotype. interestingly, the second peak has the same p value as the first and lies in the glutamate receptor gene metabotropic  <dig> , which is involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission. homozygous null mice for grm <dig> have been shown to have reduced hippocampal long term potentiation   <cit>  and impaired spatial learning  <cit> . these mice also have a behavioral phenotype associated with a rodent model of schizophrenia  <cit> . polymorphism at this locus may contribute to a variance in motor activity as a conditioned response to a tone.

eqtl mapping in hippocampus and striatum
using gene expression measures of  <dig>  transcripts as quantitative traits from tissue from both the hippocampus  and striatum , we mapped expression quantitative trait loci  and their corresponding expression snps  using emma . for each tissue, we calculated an independent genome-wide significance threshold corresponding to a false discovery rate  < 5%  <cit> . in hippocampus, this threshold was p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig> while in striatum the corresponding threshold was p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  we separated the esnps from each tissue into two separate categories: markers within  <dig> mb of the probe start position  and markers more than  <dig> mb away .

in hippocampus, we mapped  <dig>  cis eqtls, while in striatum we mapped  <dig> . there was strong overlap in the cis eqtls of the two tissues with  <dig>  in common  indicating that transcription regulation due to polymorphism is strongly preserved between tissues. interestingly, the set of cis eqtls unique to hippocampus was enriched in genes from the gene ontology  category  <cit>  involved in the "positive regulation of behavior" . the top  <dig> cis eqtls in each tissue along with locations of their corresponding peak markers and minimum p values are provided in additional file  <dig> .

the presence of a snp within the 50mer probe sequence of the transcripts interrogated by the microarray might produce spurious false positive cis eqtls due to a change in binding avidity. to investigate this possibility, we downloaded a list of  <dig> , <dig> known snps from the perlegen snp database http://mouse.cs.ucla.edu/mousehapmap and searched for each of these snps in the  <dig>  probes on the illumina microarray. of the snps in this list,  <dig>  probes contained at least one snp. in the hippocampus, we observed  <dig> eqtls with snps while  <dig> were expected proportionally . the striatum also showed slight enrichment with  <dig> cis eqtls exhibiting snps in probes with  <dig> expected . although probe snps did increase the number of observed cis eqtls, the proportion was <15%, suggesting that >85% of cis eqtls do not have evidence of being artifacts due to polymorphism. of course, other naturally occurring polymorphisms likely exist that are not contained in the perlegen snp database and could also lead to false positive associations.

in the hippocampus, we mapped  <dig>  trans esnps regulating a total of  <dig>  unique probes, while in the striatum, we mapped trans  <dig>  esnps regulating a total of  <dig>  unique probes. using a counting algorithm , we estimated these numbers corresponded to a total of  <dig>  trans eqtls in the hippocampus and  <dig>  trans eqtls in the striatum. genome-wide probe/marker plots for each significant esnp are provided in the supplementary materials . selected cis and trans eqtls from each tissue are shown in figure 3a - 3d.

comparison of our data with a recent eqtl survey in the hippocampus using heterogeneous stock mice  <cit>  showed significant preservation of cis eqtls , while trans eqtls did not show significant overlap. this discrepancy could be due to weaker effect sizes for trans eqtls in general compared to cis or due to differing thresholds for significance. previous studies also found that trans eqtls replicated less frequently than cis  <cit> . a recent study of liver using the hmdp  <cit>  found  <dig>  cis eqtls and  <dig>  probes with at least one trans eqtl with p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  we detected similar numbers of cis eqtls but more trans loci, even though the same significance threshold was employed for both types of eqtl. this discrepancy suggests differences in the regulatory networks of hepatic versus neural tissue and may reflect greater transcriptional complexity in the brain.

to survey whether trans gene regulation in hippocampus was similar to that found in the striatum, we compared the probes regulated by each marker across the two tissues. using a  <dig> ×  <dig> contingency table, we determined if a probe was regulated by each marker in the hippocampus or not  and regulated by the same marker in the striatum or not. there was a significant overlap in the genes regulated by each marker across the tissues  =  <dig> ), suggesting strong similarities in the regulatory networks of the two tissues. a genome-wide plot of the -log <dig> of the degree of overlap between tissues for genes regulated by each marker between tissues is shown in figure 3e. some markers clearly show better preservation of regulated probes than others. for instance a snp on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb regulates  <dig> unique genes in the hippocampus and  <dig> genes in the striatum, with  <dig> of the genes in common. these hubs may have strong control of expression across different tissues. despite the significant overlap, differences in regulation are likely important in delineating the cellular disparity between hippocampus and striatum.

weighted gene correlation network analysis 
we looked at the large scale organization of gene co-expression networks in the hippocampus and striatum microarray datasets. weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a data reduction method that groups genes into modules in an unsupervised manner based on self-organizing properties of complex systems. these co-expression networks are based on topological overlap between genes while considering the correlation genes have with each other and the degree of shared connections within the network. this method has been used in several recent systems genetics studies to reveal functional gene networks  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> modules in hippocampus containing  <dig> to  <dig>  genes and  <dig> modules in the striatum containing  <dig> to  <dig>  genes . the largest module in each tissue is the grey module which is reserved for genes that do not separate into any other modules . the hippocampus expression data organized into five more modules than the striatum. this finding could reflect a greater cellular heterogeneity of the hippocampus compared to the striatum, as module construction can tease apart patterns of differential expression in mixtures of cell types  <cit> . there were other differences in co-expression networks between the two tissues. for instance the sienna <dig> module in the hippocampus was not preserved in striatum. this module was significantly enriched in neuropeptide hormone activity  and oxygen binding  indicating that these molecular classes may play important roles in hippocampal function.

to evaluate the degree of module conservation across the hippocampus and striatum, we calculated z scores for preservation of each module using the hippocampus as a reference. the zsummary statistic encapsulates evidence that a network module is preserved between a reference and a test network based on aspects of within-module network density and connectivity patterns  <cit> . lower z.summary.pres scores imply module differences while larger ones indicate preservation. figure  <dig> demonstrates that most gene co-expression modules showed some degree of preservation across hippocampus and striatum, with larger modules showing better preservation than smaller ones.

the gene expression properties of each of these modules can be condensed into module eigengenes  which represent the first principal component of each module  <cit> . by correlating these mes to behavioral phenotypes, we were able to identify groups of genes with relationships with aspects of conditional fear. figure  <dig> shows the correlation of each me in the hippocampus with the behavioral phenotypes of cued and context immobility . we focused on hippocampus, as this tissue has been previously implicated in learning, memory, and fear  <cit> .

the context immobility phenotype  showed the strongest correlations with two mes in the hippocampus: brown  and darkgrey . we focus on these two modules for further analysis and annotate them context fear module  <dig>  and context fear module  <dig>  respectively. notably, no mes showed significant correlations with cued immobility  even though cue and context immobility phenotypes clustered together . this observation is consistent with the biology of cued immobility which relies on the amygdala but is hippocampal dependent  <cit> .

we looked for functional enrichment of specific gene ontologies  in the two selected context fear modules using the program goeast, which provides an fdr corrected q value  <cit>  score for enrichment in each category. the most highly represented ontologies are shown in additional file  <dig> tables s <dig> and s <dig>  genes in the intracellular portion of the cell were enriched in both modules , as were those involved in the mitochondrion . by contrast, classes of genes involved in metabolic processes and gene expression were specific to cf <dig>  genes involved in protein targeting and the rough endoplasmic reticulum were prominent in cf <dig> but not in cf <dig>  results of correlations between mes and all quantified behavioral traits for the hippocampus and striatum are provided in additional file  <dig> .

genes within each module are prioritized according to their intramodular connectivity . those with a high degree of connectivity are considered hubs and can be viewed as important players in molecular pathways. there was a high correlation between the intramodular connectivity measures of each gene across the hippocampus and striatum  indicating strong similarities in the transcriptional networks of these neural tissues.

the gene mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  was one of the most highly connected genes in cf <dig> and has been previously implicated in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory  <cit> . the gene proteasome   <dig> s subunit, non-atpase,  <dig>  acted as another hub in cf <dig>  while in cf <dig>  the genes ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2a , nuclear factor i/b , and ubiquitin specific peptidase  <dig>  had the strongest intramodular connectivity and served as hubs for this module. these results suggest a role for targeted protein degradation in pathways associated with context dependent fear, consistent with a recent study that showed that synaptic protein degradation through polyubiquitination underlies the destabilization of retrieved fear memory  <cit> . other co-expressed genes identified in these modules may also play critical roles in the molecular mechanisms governing learning and memory. complete details for the gene co-expression network analysis for each tissue and the corresponding measures of intramodular connectivity for each gene can be found in supplementary materials .

mes as quantitative traits
each module eigengene can be considered a quantitative trait, allowing for mapping of snps associated with variation in groups of co-expressed genes. this strategy reveals loci that perturb the expression of gene modules with hopes of uncovering key drivers for traits of physiological relevance  <cit> . mapping results that survive a bonferroni correction for all  <dig>  markers are summarized in table  <dig>  loci regulating six mes in the hippocampus were mapped, of which four were preserved in the striatum and two were specific to hippocampus. the first hippocampal specific locus regulated the darkolivegreen module and mapped to a snp on chromosome  <dig> within the intron for the gene tea domain family member  <dig> , a gene known to be associated with transcription factor complexes. this module was enriched in the cellular component flotillin complex  and the molecular function calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity . the second hippocampal specific locus regulated the white module and mapped to a snp on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb. this module consisted of genes involved in the positive regulation of the acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus .

the module with the strongest association to physiologically relevant go categories that also possessed regulatory loci for both tissues was the yellowgreen module in the hippocampus . this module was enriched in antigen processing and presentation  and mhc protein complex . this module may play a role in synaptic remodeling, as neuronal mhc class i molecules were recently found to regulate synapses in the central nervous system in response to activity  <cit> . interestingly, the regulatory locus for this module was identical for hippocampus and striatum. a potential candidate for this locus was flotillin  <dig> , a gene with a cis eqtl in both hippocampus and striatum ~ <dig> kb away from this peak marker. this gene product has been found to accumulate in tangle-bearing neurons of alzheimer's disease  <cit>  and may play a role in learning. in addition, the flotillin complex featured in the darkolivegreen module regulated by a hippocampal locus . other genes in these identified modules should be examined as potential players in the molecular pathways for fear conditioning.

network edge orienting: prioritizing directed trait networks
to look for relationships between genetic variation, differences in gene expression, and behavioral phenotypes, we employed the network edge orienting   <cit>  algorithm. using snp markers as causal anchors, neo assigns directionality to trait networks and provides a way to prioritize genes with expression profiles that are coincident with quantitative behavioral phenotypes .

we performed a neo single marker analysis on markers with an fdr < 10% in the behavioral qtl mapping. the software uses structural equation modeling to fit five models: causal, reactive, independent, and two confounded models. neo compares the best fitting model relative to the next best fitting model, yielding a log <dig> likelihood ratio, leo.nb.atob, for each significant snp for each of the behavioral endpoints. values greater than  <dig>  for this score indicate that the causal model fits the input data twice as well as the next best model; a score of  <dig> indicates a ten-fold better fit. the measure rmsea.atob is an index of model fit, with values <  <dig>  representing a good fit.

genetic variation at a snp on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  was also shown to influence the expression of the nearby gene kinesin-like protein 3a  which then contributed to variation in thigmotaxis . kif3a is a kinesin gene involved in moving axon cargo  <cit>  and has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease involving degeneration of motor neurons  <cit> .

variation at a snp on chromosome  <dig> resulted in a change in expression of the gene start domain-containing  <dig>  which then influenced immobility induced by a novel context . the genes 6330503k22rik and kif3a also appear as strong candidates for fear related behavior in the neo analysis for the striatum , underscoring the similarity of transcriptional regulation in the two tissues.

discussion
fear conditioning provides an opportunity to survey a range of clinically relevant processes including short and long-term memory, context generalization, and memory extinction, making it an efficient tool with which to probe the genetics of fear dependent behavior. to map fear related qtls, we subjected a population of inbred mouse strains to a standard fear conditioning procedure and follow-up memory tests. we then combined behavioral phenotype data with snp genotypes and tissue specific gene expression to search for candidate genes and related networks associated with fear phenotypes. across  <dig> behavioral endpoints, we mapped a total of  <dig> qtls, highlighting the complexity of behavioral regulation and showcasing the value of hmdp for mapping fear loci.

the inbred strains of the hmdp were not randomly selected, but were, in fact, carefully chosen to avoid, insofar as possible, high correlation of non-linked genome segments. nevertheless, there are some shared segments across the genome due to bottlenecks in the breeding and the history of the strains. emma endeavors to correct for these artifacts in the association analysis. however, some caution should be applied to the interpretation of the mapping results, since bias may remain which cannot be overcome by the analysis of the data.

the strongest behavioral qtl in our investigation was for the phenotype cue immobility and had two peak markers on chromosome  <dig>  these markers were located in the adjacent genes tyr and grm <dig> and had identical p values of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  yet there were recombination breakpoints between them. many hmdp strains have mutations in tyr and are albino, resulting in possibly learning and memory deficits due to decreased visual acuity. however, a study that examined this allele specifically showed that it plays only a minor role in cue immobility and that additional loci are likely to influence fear conditioning  <cit> . grm <dig> is an attractive candidate gene for this locus, since it has previously been shown to be involved in hippocampal ltp.

we surveyed the architecture of transcriptional regulation across two brain regions. we found a smaller number of cis and trans eqtls in the hippocampus than in the striatum. this diminution may be caused by signal dilution due to the heterogeneous cellular nature of the hippocampus. however we found that the cis and trans eqtls in the two tissues overlapped significantly, indicating that dna polymorphism has a robust effect in modulating gene expression across tissues.

by simplifying the gene expression data into modules, we identified groups of genes that are related to fear related behavior. two such modules in the hippocampus  showed strong correlations with context-dependent fear measures, allowing identification of networks of genes whose co-expression co-varied with fear phenotypes across the hmdp. we assigned priorities to genes within each module based on their level of intramodular connectivity and mapped loci responsible for regulating mes in both hippocampus and striatum. cued and context immobility were phenotypically similar as they clustered together in the behavioral dendrogram. however, the two identified modules did not show strong correlations with cued fear, confirming suggesting that the two different types of fear are expressed through different neural and/or molecular pathways.

a hub gene in cf <dig>  and two of the most highly connected genes in cf <dig>  have been shown to play roles in ubiquitination. interestingly, others have shown that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is involved in initiating long-term stable memory, as both specific removal of specific inhibitory proteins and gene induction are likely to be critical players in fear conditioning  <cit> . other components in these modules may be implicated by association in these genetic pathways and provide attractive targets for further investigation.

structural equation modeling allowed us to identify single markers that influenced the expression of single genes which in turn influence fear related phenotypes. we identified five genes with causal relationships for fear-related phenotypes in the hippocampus and striatum including 6330503k22rik, rps15a, kif3a, stard <dig>  and plvap.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, looking at expression patterns in genes and groups of genes in various neural tissues has helped to elucidate the complex molecular networks contributing to fear dependent behavior. while the current approach yielded several potential loci and candidate genes, additional inbred strains would provide increased power for more comprehensive mapping. next generation sequencing technologies and proteomics should afford even deeper views of genetic polymorphism and expression as we continue to refine gene networks of fear neurobiology.
