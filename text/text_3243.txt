BACKGROUND
aging is a ubiquitous process that involves the progressive deterioration of physiological functions. many of the behavioral changes associated with aging in humans are also observed in lower organisms. these changes include, but are not limited to, a decline in learning and memory, locomotor ability, olfactory sensitivity, and circadian rhythmicity  <cit> . since behavior is largely affected by the functional state of the nervous system, age-related behavioral declines could very likely indicate the perturbations in the brain. as an organism ages, most tissues undergo multilayered changes and are subject to cellular damage that accumulate with age. it has been well established that there are changes in gene expression in both model organisms and humans as they age. dna microarray studies on whole worms and flies have also been used to profile transcriptional changes of aging  <cit> . large-scale transcriptional changes in mice and primates identified a number of functional genes that change expression levels during aging  <cit> .

understanding the gene expression changes that occur during aging in the human brain is of particular interest due to its relation to both normal and pathological neurodegeneration and is particularly challenging due to the inherent complexity of the brain at the anatomical and cellular level. like other biological systems, the complexities of nervous systems at different levels have been studied using a variety of animal models  <cit> . these animal models have been instrumental with the identification of key neuronal functions in humans and have demonstrated conserved signaling pathways that are critical in aging and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

fundamental brain functions are performed by subsets of neurons – neuronal circuits – that are classically defined as distinct networks of hundreds of neurons. the development of neural circuits is initiated with synaptic connections and refined by systematic neuronal activity. due to the close relationship between neural connectivity and neural activity throughout the brain, it is essential to consider how neural circuitry function at the single neuronal level. recent studies suggest that experience can dictate the number of neurons or circuits regulating a specific behavior  <cit> . these studies emphasize the significance of probing gene functions at the circuit and single neuron level.

to understand aging at the single neuron level, we explored the marine snail aplysia californica that are characterized by a simple central nervous system . aplysia cns has been extensively studied to understand molecular and physiological changes during memory storage and neural circuitries underlying specific behaviors. for example, kandel and colleagues identified neural circuits underlying the gill withdrawal reflex response and have identified several key determinants of learning and memory storage  <cit> . studies by peretz and coworkers have described the age dependent sensitivity of the gill withdrawal reflex and osmoregulation  <cit> . a key advantage of using aplysia is that specific behavior is mediated by a simple circuitry  <cit> . moreover the changes associated with a specific behavior can be mapped back to the level of single neurons, thus providing access to molecular and biochemical mechanisms of basic neuronal functions at single-neuron resolution. this possibility offer one of the biggest advantages of employing aplysia for studying molecular and cellular basis of behavior when compared to other model organisms such as worms, flies and mice. exploring these advantages, age-associated changes in gene expression of identified neurons r <dig> and lpl <dig> from abdominal ganglia of young  and old  animals were recently described  <cit> . significant changes in gene expression in old r <dig> neurons, and a unique set of genes differentially expressed during aging were identified  <cit> .

senescence in aplysia is characterized by declining weight, reproduction , reflex response and finally death in 11–13 months  <cit> . impairment of the long-term retention of habituation, prevention of acquisition of sensitization in the gill withdrawal reflex  and reduction of the response to food stimuli  <cit>  are associated with aging in aplysia. at the macromolecular level aging associated changes include transcriptional and translational changes  <cit>  in response to circadian rhythm  <cit> , and the change in electrophysiological properties in identified neurons  <cit> .

despite these studies the details of how aging alters gene expression and specific signaling pathways in single neurons and circuitries remains to be determined. to address this, we have focused on age-associated gene expression changes in aplysia neuron r <dig>  the r <dig> neuron is one of the best-studied neurons used to understand single neuron burst dynamics  <cit> , neuronal circuitry functions and cellular basis of behavior  <cit> . r <dig> has been a subject of extensive electrophysiological studies due to its role in egg laying  <cit> , neurochemical modulation  <cit> .

using custom designed microarrays  <cit>  we compared the gene-expression profiles of single r <dig> neurons from mature  and old  animals and identified several genes that are bidirectionally regulated. our selection of the specific ages  for this study is based on the fact that previous studies in aplysia demonstrated robust changes in behavioral readouts and electrophysiological properties occurring between 4–6 months when the animal is attaining sexual maturity  <cit> , and the behavioral and physiological expressions start to get weakened in animals 250 days  of age and older  <cit> . therefore we assumed that by selecting ages 6 month and 11–12 months, we would be able to capture the significant differences in gene expression and signaling pathways. next, we mapped these differentially expressed genes to human functional pathways and identified three networks involved in cell death, neurological diseases and cell morphology. finally, using single neuron qpcr analyses, we found that aging alters expression of key transcription regulators  and translation modulator  in identified neurons r <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and r <dig> in unique ways.

RESULTS
identification of differentially expressed genes during aging of single identified neuron r15
earlier studies have shown that aplysia exhibit behavioral changes associated with aging  <cit> . we assumed that age-dependent changes in specific behaviors in aplysia are associated with specific molecular changes in single neurons. to investigate age associated molecular changes in single neurons, we studied r <dig> neurons isolated from two age groups that are six months apart, sexually mature  and old . aplysia reach senescence in laboratory conditions by 12–14 months  <cit> . as described in the “background” section, r <dig> has been subjected to extensive electrophysiological characterization to gain insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying neuron endogenous bursting  <cit> , and is implicated in reproduction, and osmoregulation  <cit> .

the overall strategy employed to identify differentially expressed genes is shown in figure  <dig>  to identify age-associated changes, we followed an unbiased gene expression analysis using custom designed microarray that contain a  <dig> -oligonucleotide array  that were designed from each non-redundant sequence in the aplysia est database  <cit> .

single r <dig> neurons were isolated from abdominal ganglia of mature and old animals, each group in biological triplicates. we carried out dual color microarray analyses following linear amplification of total rnas from individual neurons. scatter plots and correlation coefficients for each single neuron were calculated . the correlation between the biological replicates in each group was calculated using principle component analysis  mapping as shown in figure 2a. figure 2a shows the first three principal components of microarray analysis data  in x, y and z respectively, and demonstrate correlation between the expression profile of the three single neurons per group . similarly the pca was calculated for the technical replicates for each neuron and the first three principal components  in x, y and z respectively showed a positive correlation . our analysis of microarray data have identified  <dig> probe sets that are differentially expressed based on the criteria of a fold change of ≥ <dig> and adjusted p <  <dig>  between mature versus old neurons .

the  <dig> differentially expressed probes  were annotated using a new aplysia sequence resource database generated by the institute for genome sciences , at the university of maryland. the sequences were generated by the broad institute and were distributed to the community  through the institute of genome sciences , university of maryland. after considering a 2-fold change cut-off, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts,  <dig> were enriched in r <dig> mature and  <dig> were enriched in r <dig> old neurons. this corresponded to ~56% upregulated transcripts and ~43% downregulated transcripts during aging. the top  <dig> transcripts that are enriched in mature or old are listed in table  <dig>  the complete list of differentially expressed transcripts in mature and old are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the differentially expressed genes include, kinases , phosphatases , ion channels , neuropeptides , transcription factors  protein synthesis regulators , and those involved in regulating metabolism .

go analysis of differentially expressed genes in r15
to understand the biological significance of the microarray data the annotated aplysia sequences were mapped to gene ontology  biological process category. we identified several go categories specific among genes upregulated or downregulated with age . we found  <dig> genes upregulated in the mature neurons that were mapped into  <dig> biological process categories at level three of the go analysis. however, there are only  <dig> go categories for  <dig> genes that are downregulated in the mature neurons .

four go categories , macromolecule localization , response to endogenous stimulus , and response to external stimulus  are unique to the upregulated gene data set of mature neurons . with the exception of a few processes, the number of sequences upregulated or downregulated in each go category is roughly similar, indicating a bidirectional differential expression during aging.

further analysis of the key functions of specific genes belonging to a particular go category and the directionality of the expression suggest their possible role in altered biological functions associated with aging. for example, in the category “catabolic process”  enriched sequences are significantly higher than the downregulated sequences. one of the sequences, kinesin 1b, is downregulated with aging. kinesin is a motor protein involved in the transport of cargos such as synaptic vesicles and mitochondria from cellbody to synapses and is a critical mediator of long-term memory storage. on the other hand, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase  <dig> that is involved in the repression of global protein synthesis, is upregulated with age as its expression is higher in the neurons of old aplysia. key regulators of signaling cascades such as map kinase  <dig> and map kinase-activated protein kinase  <dig>  and transcription factor  <dig> were consistently downregulated in r <dig> with age. intriguingly, adenylate cyclase and churchill were upregulated in r <dig> with age. adenylate cyclase is involved in cyclic amp metabolism whereas churchill is involved in neural development.

identification of human homologs of aplysia genes that are altered during aging
next, we searched for human homologs of genes that are bidirectionally regulated in r <dig> during aging. of the  <dig> gene ids from the differentially expressed gene set between mature and old r <dig> neurons,  <dig> ids were successfully mapped into different human pathways using ingenuity pathway analysis . the top  <dig> functional categories that met stringent statistical criteria and significant representation of genes are illustrated in figure 4a. the mapped datasets contain either upregulated or downregulated genes associated with specific functional pathways .

we next focused on the top three signaling networks from the ipa analysis. network  <dig>  has  <dig> genes differentially expressed and associated with cell signaling, cell morphology, and skeletal muscular system development. foxo <dig>   one of the upregulated genes in the network, has been implicated in aging process  <cit> . network  <dig> has  <dig> genes differentially expressed that are involved in cell death and survival, cellular function maintenance and embryonic development . two genes in network  <dig> atr  and mlh <dig>  are upregulated in the mature neuron and earlier studies showed their role in aging and longevity  <cit> . network  <dig> has  <dig> genes differentially expressed and is associated with neurological diseases, developmental and hereditary disorders . thus our mapping of aplysia single neuron gene expression signatures into the human database has identified several evolutionarily conserved genes that are important for human aging.

aging of r <dig> is associated with specific changes in expression of creb and s <dig> kinase genes
transcription and translation are two molecular processes that undergo dynamic changes during aging process  <cit> . to quantitate changes in transcription and translation in the r <dig> neuron during aging, we carried out quantitative pcr  analysis of expression of creb <dig> and creb  <dig>  and s <dig> kinase  in mature and old abdominal ganglia  and individual neurons. importantly, these genes are identified as downregulated genes in old r <dig> neuron from our microarray analysis. we find from qpcr analysis that creb <dig> in mature and old ganglia did not show any significant differences in expression  whereas the single neuron analysis showed significant changes in expression during aging. specifically, creb <dig> showed significant change in the expression levels with  <dig> fold decrease in the old neuron, where as creb  <dig> is ~  <dig> fold and s6k is ~ <dig>  fold downregulated in the old neuron  confirming our microarray data. student t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance while calculating the fold change between mature and old single neurons and a p-value <  <dig>  is considered statistically significant.

next we examined whether creb and s6k are downregulated during aging of other neurons in the abdominal ganglia. to address this question we studied gene expression in three identified neurons, r <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> . l <dig> and l <dig> are two motor neurons and r <dig> is a cholinergic neuron. l <dig> is well characterized for its role in learning and memory of gill withdrawal reflex  <cit> . using qpcr we quantified the creb <dig>  creb <dig> and s6k transcript levels in mature and old neurons. in contrast to r <dig>  mrnas for creb <dig>  and s6k  were upregulated significantly whereas creb <dig> mrna was not changed  in r <dig>  interestingly, we found that in old l <dig> neuron, creb <dig> and creb <dig> mrnas were not changing significantly, however s6k mrna was ~ <dig>  fold downregulated  whereas in l <dig> neurons, creb <dig>  creb <dig> and s6k mrnas were downregulated significantly  .

aging induced changes in gene expression are neuron specific
to further understand the neuron-specific changes during aging, from single neuron qpcr measurements we calculated the percentage changes in the expression of each transcript in different neurons. we observed 80 ± 10% changes in the expression of creb <dig> mrna in r <dig>  and r <dig>  neurons whereas in l <dig>  creb <dig> expression was 50 ± 5% downregulated. unlike significant changes in creb <dig> mrna levels in r <dig>  r <dig> and l <dig> the expression of creb <dig> mrna did not significantly change in l <dig> single neuron  during aging. similarly, we measured the percentage change in creb <dig> mrna levels and found that in r <dig> and l <dig>  the creb <dig> mrna levels were not affected by aging, however there were significant changes in r <dig>  and l <dig>  . interestingly, s6k mrna expression was affected by aging in all neurons. however the magnitude of change varied significantly among these four neurons. in the r <dig> and l <dig> neurons s6k mrna expression changed 35 ± 10%  whereas in l <dig> neuron the percentage change was 60 ± 10% . change in r <dig> neuron was very different from the rest of the neurons with 400 ± 15% upregulation .

discussion
aging is a fundamental biological process that has distinct phenotypical, physiological and molecular level characteristics. the gene expression level change hypothesis of aging is one of the principal theories of age-associated changes in cellular functions in many tissues, including the brain  <cit> . accordingly, the functional genomics approach is one of the useful ways for describing some of the molecular characteristics of neuronal changes underlying normal aging and neurodegeneration  <cit> . considering the cellular heterogeneity of the brain and that behavior is regulated by specific neural circuitries, single circuit or single neuron expression analysis could be a better way to look into the specific molecular changes associated with behavioral decline during aging. such studies might provide novel therapeutic targets and accelerate future drug discovery efforts. our comparative analysis of creb <dig> expression during aging in the intact ganglia and individual neurons highlight the importance of single neuron study of aging. while we did not find any statistically significant differences in the expression of creb <dig> in the abdominal ganglia  during aging, we observed significant differences in creb <dig> expression in our single neuron measurements. in this study, we have explored the age-associated molecular changes in four different identified neurons  in the abdominal ganglia of aplysia.

bidirectional changes in gene expression during aging
our microarray analyses of gene expression in single r <dig> neurons have identified a subset of genes,  <dig> of which are bi-directionally regulated during aging. we studied two age groups, sexually mature  and old animals that are close to senescence . of the  <dig> genes we found that  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated in mature r <dig> neurons when compared to old r <dig> neurons. based on the conservative estimate that aplysia contain approximately  <dig>  genes and that our custom oligonucleotide array correspond to approximately  <dig>  genes, we estimate that this array contain about 50-60% expected transcriptome. therefore the change in the gene expression of  <dig> transcripts suggests that approximately 10% of the genes are bi-directionally regulated  in the r <dig> neuron during aging. however this change might not reflect the net changes in transcriptome during aging. the changes only reflect mrna regulation in the two age groups we studied. it is quite possible that noncoding transcriptome might be regulated differently.

in our study, differentially expressed genes from both age groups fall into several functional categories that include transcription, translation, protein synthesis, degradation and metabolism. this alteration of gene expression identified in the r <dig> neuron is consistent with the molecular aging data from other organisms ranging from fly to human where a considerable number of genes that belong to different functional categories undergo dynamic gene expression during aging  <cit> . our finding that specific sets of genes that are upregulated or downregulated in single old neurons, indicate that age-associated changes are bidirectional at the molecular level. the age-linked decline in many physiological processes are in fact associated with an increase in the expression of many genes that could alter specific signaling pathways by generating an imbalance in the functional networks, hence affecting key biological functions. consistent with this idea, the go category analysis of microarray data in figure  <dig> shows that most of the differentially expressed genes share common go. go terms corresponding to cell-cell communication, response to internal stimulus, response to external stimulus, and macromolecule localization was absent in old neurons. these biological processes are vital for the maintenance of neuronal health and we find that during aging these processes become defective. thus our studies suggest significant signaling imbalance associated with aging.

regulation of human relevant signaling pathways in r <dig> during aging
we next analyzed our data in the context of human aging by mapping on to human pathways using ingenuity pathway analysis . differentially expressed genes were further mapped to identify signaling pathways homologous to human.  <dig> human genes were mapped in the ipa gene list marking ~35% of annotated genes differentially expressed in aplysia. the top three pathways are associated with cell death and survival, cellular function and maintenance, cell signaling and neurological disease. further supporting our notion that aging is associated with an imbalance in signaling, we find that both upregulated and downregulated genes were mapped to the same network. thus the up or down regulation of nodes of the networks will affect the output of the network, affecting various biological processes. at the single cell level, few key biological processes that are affected by aging include intra and inter-cellular transport, cell-cell communications, transcriptional and translational regulation and epigenetic regulations, all of which significantly change the functioning profile of a cell. therefore these results are likely to be relevant in the context of human aging.

transcription and translation are differentially regulated in single neurons during aging
transcription and translation are fundamental to cell maintenance and survival. creb has been studied extensively in the context of brain specific functions such as synaptic plasticity  <cit> , long-term memory  <cit>  and aging  <cit> . recently creb has been shown to be involved in human aging  <cit> , cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . in mice, creb regulate aging related genes such as the a-t-mutated gene   <cit> . consistent with these observations, we find that the expression of creb is altered at the single neuron level during aging.

ribosomal s <dig> kinase , a translation regulator, is differentially expressed in r <dig> during aging. s6k is a downstream target of rapamycin  pathway, a key modulator of aging  <cit> . s6k is involved in several signaling pathways  <cit>  that contribute to various pathological states, including aging-related pathology  <cit>  and extending the life span of mammalian cells  <cit> . in agreement with these results obtained for mammalian aging, we find from our single neuron microarray and qpcr analysis that s6k is downregulated during aging of aplysia r <dig> neuron.

differential aging of neural circuitries
moroz and kohn  have shown, using gene expression analysis, that two cholinergic neurons, lpi <dig> and r <dig>  age differentially  <cit> . we studied creb <dig>  creb <dig> and s6k mrna expression in four neurons . in support of the differential aging idea, we find that age-dependent changes in expression of these genes are neuron specific. we made two conclusions from the gene expression analysis of these four identified neurons. first, we find that during the aging process expression of genes are differentially affected in neurons. in r <dig> and l <dig> neurons, the creb <dig>  creb <dig> and s6k showed significant decrease in expression, whereas in l <dig> only expression of s6k was affected. in r <dig>  unlike the other three neurons during aging, creb <dig> and s6k were upregulated. second, the extent to which expression of each gene is altered depends on the neuron. for example, creb <dig> showed ~85% decrease in expression in r <dig> whereas l <dig> showed a 50% decrease. on the other hand, the percentage decrease in creb <dig> in r <dig> and l <dig> were not significantly different. interestingly, the creb <dig> levels did not change in old l <dig> and r <dig>  since these neurons are part of circuitries involved in different behaviors, our results suggest that as in the case of single neurons, different neural circuitries could also age differently and may directly contribute to the specific neuronal correlates of aging. consistent to this idea, it was shown that different regions of mammalian brain age differently and that changes in specific circuitries are associated with behavioral decline during normal aging  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates the importance of analysis of single neurons to understand transcriptome changes associated with aging. we conclude from our single neuron analysis that genes undergo changes in expression levels during aging. these changes could be bidirectional- sets of genes upregulated and sets of genes downregulated during aging. importantly, several molecular changes during aging of mammalian cells are identified in aging aplysia neurons suggesting that molecular changes associated with aging involve several conserved mechanisms. furthermore, all neurons do not necessarily undergo similar changes in gene expression. for example, in the case of the r <dig> neuron, transcriptional and translational regulators that we studied were upregulated during aging whereas expressions of these regulators were downregulated in the other three neurons. also the magnitude of change in expressions of genes is specific to individual neurons. this now poses a question - how and why aging affects neurons differently? whole transcriptome and epigenome analyses of identified neurons might address this challenge.
