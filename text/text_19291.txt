BACKGROUND
a diphtheria-like infectious disease caused by corynebacterium ulcerans is increasing in clinical importance in developed countries and is now regarded as “diphtheria” in europe  <cit> . infection with c. ulcerans occurs in a wide range of hosts, including cats, dogs, pigs, cows, and whales  <cit> . the first clearly documented case of zoonotic transmission involved a dog, as reported by lartigue et al.  <cit> . this is in contrast to the causative agent of classical diphtheria, c. diphtheriae, whose host species is thought to be limited to humans  <cit> . nevertheless, the two species share a common feature: upon lysogenization of tox-encoding bacteriophages, they become toxigenic and are able to produce the potent diphtheria toxin  <cit> . this toxin is known to contribute to disease progression, occasionally leading to death. it is encoded by a single gene designated tox, situated inside prophages lysogenized in the bacterial genome of c. diphtheriae <cit> . the prophages are capable of induction, by ultraviolet light or dna-damaging agents such as mitomycin c, and yield β-, δ-, ω- and other functional bacteriophage particles  <cit> . some types of bacteriophages can infect both c. diphtheriae and c. ulcerans <cit> . furthermore, the c. ulcerans tox gene is also encoded in a genome region surrounded by phage attachment  sites conserved between the two species  <cit> . the nucleotide sequences of c. ulcerans tox genes were published by sing et al. they showed some diversity in the genetic sequence among c. ulcerans strains, in contrast to the highly conserved c. diphtheriae tox gene  <cit> .

in  <dig>  the nucleotide sequence of the whole genome of c. diphtheriae strain nctc <dig> was reported  <cit> . the sequence information revealed some striking features of the bacterial genome, such as the presence of as many as  <dig> pathogenicity islands   <cit> , uncommon among c. diphtheriae strains  <cit> . the presence of a tox-positive prophage flanked by the att regions was confirmed and supported the findings of previous reports  <cit> . despite comparable clinical importance, the genomic sequence of toxigenic c. ulcerans has not yet been reported. in the present study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the toxigenic c. ulcerans isolate  <dig> genome, obtained in  <dig> from the pharyngeal pseudomembrane of a 52-year-old woman presenting with a sore throat and fever. this was the first toxigenic c. ulcerans infection reported in japan. this patient had been living with nearly  <dig> cats before the onset of illness  <cit> . details of the bacteriological characteristics of the isolate have been described elsewhere  <cit> . our analysis was especially directed towards the structure of the tox-positive prophage because of its unexpectedly novel structure.

RESULTS
genome sequence and genomic information for c. ulcerans 0102
to determine the complete genome sequence of c. ulcerans  <dig>  obtained short reads were assembled into five contigs by de novo assembly. each gap was filled by direct pcr and sequencing. a circular chromosome sequence of c. ulcerans  <dig> represents  <dig> ,188 bp, with a g + c content of  <dig> %  and corresponds to the predicted restriction fragment profiles obtained by pfge analysis . the chromosome possesses  <dig>  coding sequences,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> rrn rrna operons.

comparative genome analysis of three pathogenic corynebacterium spp
pair-wise sequence alignment revealed a highly conserved synteny among pathogenic corynebacterium spp. . no significant genome rearrangements, such as inversion or transposition events, were observed among the three species, in accordance with previous findings  <cit> . the sequence similarity suggests that the chromosomes of c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> are highly similar compared with that of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> . once again, this is in accordance with previous findings in other c. ulcerans strains  <cit> . similarly, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, based on the partial sequence of rpob, indicates that c. ulcerans  <dig> is closely related with c. pseudotuberculosis, but clearly distinguishable from the c. diphtheriae clade . three prophages, Φculc0102-i, -ii, -iii, were identified in c. ulcerans  <dig>  one of the prophages, Φculc0102-i, carries tox, the gene encoding the diphtheria toxin .

the tox-positive prophage of c. ulcerans 0102
the Φculc0102-i prophage of c. ulcerans  <dig> is integrated into trnaarg  , suggesting that the integration site is identical to that in the c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> corynephage. in contrast, the recently reported c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genomes possess a phage-related integrase  and a nitric oxide reductase  gene, respectively, instead of a prophage . putative attachment sequences were similar between both prophages carrying the tox genes .

the two tox-positive prophages share the same structural features, with genes aligned in an ‘integrase - packaging - head - tail - lysis - toxin’ orientation . pair-wise alignment of the prophages indicates a high similarity in the region encoding the putative integrase, the 3′-ends of culc0102_ <dig> and culc0102_ <dig>  tox, and the attachment sites . the major phage machineries encoded in the internal phage region showed low similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels  between c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. diphtheriae nctc <dig> 

discussion
whole-genome sequencing has revealed that the c. ulcerans  <dig> genome is composed of  <dig> ,188 bp with a g + c content of  <dig> %. these values are similar to those recently reported for c. ulcerans strains  <dig>  and br-ad <dig>   <cit> . c. ulcerans  <dig> shares many common features with the two previously reported strains, including  <dig> virulence factors. strain  <dig> is distinctive with respect to the features of prophages integrated in its genome. it possesses a unique tox-positive prophage, Φculc0102-i, in its chromosome . in the same position of the recently reported c. ulcerans  <dig> genome exists a remnant phage-related integrase  gene  <cit>  . the c. ulcerans  <dig> prophage differs from the corresponding prophage in c. diphtheriae. although the integrase and tox gene sequences of Φculc0102-i showed high similarity to those of the corynephage encoding tox in c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  the major phage machinery genes in Φculc0102-i are distinct from those in other corynephages in c. diphtheriae . this suggests that c. ulcerans  <dig> did not immediately acquire the c. diphtheriae tox-positive corynephage.

there are many possible explanations for the origins of these two prophages that are tox-positive but obviously different. one of the simplest explanations we can postulate is outlined in figure  <dig>  generally, bacterial prophages are duplicated by excision from chromosomal dna and subsequent concatenation at both ends of the att sites . this duplication step indicates that two highly homologous regions, int and tox, could be in close proximity and adjacent to the att site concatenation. it could be speculated that homologous recombination between two prophages may facilitate the acquisition of the tox gene in c. ulcerans  <dig> from an unknown tox-positive prophage   <cit> . horizontal gene transfer is one of the major mechanisms of foreign gene acquisition by bacteria, as reviewed by ochman et al.  <cit> . liu et al. have demonstrated that horizontally transferred genes are often disabled and become pseudogenes. in these cases the genes are no longer beneficial to the recipients  <cit> . non-toxigenic c. diphtheriae  carry tox pseudogenes that are relatively similar to the tox genes of c. ulcerans , suggesting that horizontal gene transfer among corynebacterium spp. might occur. consistent with previous findings  <cit> , tthe tox gene in c. ulcerans  <dig> is not identical to that of c. diphtheriae ; phylogenetic analysis of tox showed greater heterogeneity among c. ulcerans isolates than that for c. diphtheriae isolates .

the c. diphtheriae tox gene is highly conserved among temporally and geographically diverse strains  <cit> , therefore greater variation in tox genes from c. ulcerans isolates suggests that this strain might have acquired the tox gene before c. diphtheriae.

in a recent report, whole genome sequence analysis of non-toxigenic c. ulcerans  <dig> and br-ad <dig>  <cit> , the β-corynephage-like truncated integrases  are located adjacent to the trnaarg gene, similar to Φculc0102-i in c. ulcerans  <dig> and c. diphtheriae. the trnaarg gene  appears to be a ‘hotspot’ for the acquisition of Φculc0102-i-like prophages by homologous integrase.

the whole genome sequences of c. ulcerans  <dig> and br-ad <dig> contain possible virulence factors, such as corynebacterial protease , phospholipase d , neuraminidase , venom serine protease , trypsin-like serine protease , rpf interacting protein , cell wall-associated hydrolase , and five surface-anchored proteins   <cit> . the spaa-type pilin, encoded by the spaabcsrta gene cluster, is considered to play a crucial role in adhesion of c. diphtheriae <cit> . the gene encoding the shaft protein of spaa-type pilin  was absent in c. ulcerans  <dig>  a feature consistent with previous findings in c. ulcerans  <dig> and br-ad <dig>  <cit> . as spab and spac proteins, which are assumed to be present in all three c. ulcerans strains, can contribute to host-cell adhesion in the absence of spaa  <cit> , this may imply a common mechanism of cell adhesion by c. ulcerans <cit> .

the c. ulcerans  <dig> strain was isolated from a patient with a rapid fatal pulmonary infection. the  <dig> strain-unique virulence factor  is located adjacent to the truncated integrase  and corresponds to the integrase of Φculc0102-i. it appears that virulence factors have been acquired as a cassette gene in the Φculc0102-i-like prophage. it is intriguing to note that the  <dig> strain does not carry the  <dig> strain-unique virulence factors , but instead carries the tox gene on Φculc0102-i, which resulted in a diphtheria-like illness in a 52-year-old woman.

isolates of c. ulcerans are generally obtained from a diverse range of animals, including humans. isolation of a human pathogen c. diphtheriae from animals has been reported previously, although it is rare  <cit> . the tox gene might be frequently transmitted through common prophages with the aid of the highly homologous regions among corynebacterium spp., including c. diphtheriae and c. ulcerans isolated from animal sources.

CONCLUSIONS
toxigenic c. ulcerans is an emerging pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans  <cit> . in the host organism, as well as in c. diphtheriae, the tox gene  <cit>  is encoded by prophages. through genome sequencing, we have identified a novel structure in a tox-positive c. ulcerans prophage with no significant sequence homology to those in c. diphtheriae. this suggests distinct origins of the prophages and thus may also explain the difference in the primary structures of their tox genes. the tox-positive bacteriophages may increase the dissemination risk of toxigenic c. ulcerans isolates, therefore, c. ulcerans isolates from both human and animal sources should be investigated further to determine the level of variation.
