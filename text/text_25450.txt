BACKGROUND
glycine soja, the annual wild progenitor of cultivated soybean, is widely distributed among east asian countries. in china, the cultivated soybean was domesticated from wild soybean more than  <dig>  years ago  <cit>  and underwent two rounds of whole genome duplication  <cit> . the first genome duplication occurred within the last  <dig> million years and the latter between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago. both g. soja and glycine max have prominent differences for various morphological and physiological characters, known as domestication syndrome  <cit> . in soybean, the process of plant breeding accelerated genetic gain and narrowed the genetic base  <cit> . the genetic diversity among 99% of north american cultivars released between  <dig> and  <dig> could be traced back to only  <dig> % of the landraces  <cit> . this loss in diversity among high-yielding adapted lines ultimately inhibits future genetic gains in productivity, broadens susceptibility to new pests and diseases, and acts as a threat to food security  <cit> . in contrast to modern soybean cultivars, wild soybeans are genetically diverse, with valuable rare alleles  <cit> . recent advances in sequencing technologies also highlighted the uniqueness of genomic content in both cultivated and wild soybean, and provide an opportunity to use g. soja to broaden the genetic base of cultivated soybean  <cit> . in addition, assessing genomic differences for key traits will provide insights into the process of speciation and domestication, and will deepen our understanding of the origin of genes involved in complex traits  <cit> .

earlier studies showed that the presence of unique alleles in wild/weedy species and primitive land races could be used to improve agronomic traits in crop plants  <cit> . later, alleles were successfully introgressed from wild species and deployed in different crops through genetic mapping and molecular marker approaches  <cit> . a number of array-based high-throughput marker genotyping platforms have been used in plant breeding, especially marker-assisted selection, to understand crop domestication and plant evolution  <cit> . these microarray-based markers have been used for high-density molecular map construction, quantitative trait locus /expression qtl mapping, and genetic diversity analysis  <cit> . among these array-based markers, single-feature polymorphism  was originally used for fine mapping and positional cloning of genes in yeast  <cit> . later, it was used in plant species with both small and complex genomes  <cit> . sfps have been widely used for different applications, such as molecular linkage map construction and qtl mapping in arabidopsis  <cit> , as well as in major cereal crops  <cit>  and legumes  <cit> .

the effective use of wild relatives to improve a wide variety of traits from yield to stress tolerance in cultivated/domesticated crops was reviewed  <cit>  and has been successfully applied in rice  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . similarly, inter-specific variation in soybean was used to identify novel alleles in g. soja that influence various traits, including domestication  <cit> , alkaline and salt tolerance  <cit> , dehydration tolerance  <cit> , yield  <cit> , resistance to pathogens and pests, and seed compositional traits  <cit> . among abiotic stresses, drought stress causes tremendous yield losses in soybean  <cit> . drought avoidance is considered to be the most relevant process to mitigate agricultural drought and maintain crop performance  <cit> . root system architecture  and root hydraulics are the key traits that affect water capture under drought-prone environments  <cit>  and sustain yield in sub-optimal conditions. thus, rsa and root distribution within the environment are important to understand nutrient and water use efficiency in plants  <cit> . recent studies in rice have shown that an increase in root depth leads to an increase in water uptake, which is translated into higher grain yield under rain-fed conditions  <cit> . the existence of genetic variation for root growth and architecture within various crop species makes rsa a promising target for crop improvement programs  <cit> . a recent study of inter-specific tomato introgression lines also emphasized the need to identify genes associated with favorable root traits and their transcription regulation  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, g. soja alleles have never been used to improve root system architecture. this is understandable because g. soja roots are often very thin, with narrow hairs, as well as reduced root mass and volume. thus, the objectives of the present study were  to identify novel alleles from a g. soja accession to explore the possibility of enhancing root architectural traits in cultivated soybean;  to detect significant qtl regions and identify candidate genes governing root traits, and  to understand the mechanisms regulating the transcript variation in an inter-specific mapping population.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation of root traits
the parents, v71- <dig> and pi  <dig>  show significant variation for a number of common soybean traits including: plant stature, root morphology, and seed size . the g. max v71- <dig> parent develops a larger root system than the wild soybean parent, g. soja pi <dig>  the recombinant inbred lines  developed from these two parents showed a transgressive segregation for root morphology : many genotypes had longer or shorter taproots and varied total root length compared with the g. max and wild parent, respectively . the phenotypic mean of all the rils were similar to the mid-parent values for all remaining traits that were measured. a shapiro–wilk test showed that the frequency distributions of these traits were approximately normal . most of the previous mapping works in root studies focused on coarse/thicker roots ; however, understanding the finer roots and their distribution are important, because they are the ones involved in nutrient and water absorption by increasing the root surface area. significant positive correlations  were found amongst various root traits measured in this study . the taproot length and tertiary root length were highly correlated  with root surface area, which influences the plant nutrient and water absorption. most of the fine roots and their distribution had similar correlations with root volume .figure  <dig>

root qtls and their interaction

presence of non-synonymous mutation in root-related genes
sequence data for the parental lines v71- <dig> and pi  <dig> were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous snps within the  <dig> selected genes, based on transcript abundance from a microarray analysis, to identify candidate genes that might contribute to variation in root phenotypes. only three of these genes , had non-synonymous snps, two in the g. soja line, pi  <dig>  and one gene  in both parental lines that had altered the amino acid content . the gene glyma07g <dig> encodes triglyceride lipase, showed higher transcript abundance and was in the qtls identified for root distribution based on length and thickness . the remaining two genes, glyma07g <dig> and glyma15g <dig>  encode apoptosis inhibitory  <dig> family protein and oxidoreductase/transition metal ion binding protein, respectively. these two genes also showed higher transcript abundance and mapped to the taproot length qtl intervals. missense mutations were also identified in four of  <dig> genes  with significant differences in transcript abundance selected within the root total length and surface area qtl confidence interval on chromosome  <dig>   . there was an insertion/deletion variation  in the coding sequence of two genes from the g. soja parent, glyma06g <dig>  and glyma06g <dig> , which were in the cell cycle-associated d <dig> type cyclin gene and the key hormone auxin-associated gene, auxin efflux carrier protein gene. five out of nine genes  selected from another wild soybean it <dig>  <cit>  had similar conserved missense mutations  to those in the wild soybean, pi <dig>  used in this study. glyma06g <dig> encodes a tpr transcription factor with high expression that is limited to the root pericycle cells .table  <dig>

expression patterns of root-related genes
parental genotypes

the differential expression of root-related genes from the g. soja accession and cultivated soybean parent enabled us to gain an understanding of the gene regulation associated with various root architecture traits. based on transcript abundance,  <dig> genes were identified with significant expression fold changes among the parental lines . nine genes had a significantly higher expression in the g. soja parental line compared with the g. max parent, while gene glyma15g <dig> showed the opposite trend. when sequence comparisons were made, three genes  had non-synonymous snps . only the gene glyma07g <dig> had a non-synonymous mutation in both parental lines. the kinesin motor family protein  had the highest expression in wild soybean, which may have contributed to the smaller and finer roots.figure  <dig> 
expression patterns of genes with high transcript abundance within the root qtl peaks detected among parental lines and selected recombinant inbred lines  selected.




eighteen genes within the qtl region on chromosome  <dig> were selected based on sequence polymorphisms with g. soja accession it <dig> . among nine genes listed in table  <dig>  three glyma06g <dig>  glyma06g <dig>  and glyma06g <dig>  showed higher expression in the g. soja parent pi  <dig> ; and four genes, glyma06g <dig>  glyma06g <dig>  glyma06g <dig>  and glyma06g <dig>  showed higher expression in the g. max parent v71- <dig> . interestingly, an uncharacterized protein  gene had higher expression levels in the g. soja parent than in g. max. the remaining nine genes in the qtl region, each with a non-synonymous mutation,  showed higher expression in g. max than in g. soja, except for glyma06g <dig> . based on 15× depth sequence data from pi  <dig>  five genes exhibited missense mutations . these mutations were conserved when this sequence was compared with other public sequence databases of diverse g. soja lines from korea  <cit>  and china  <cit> .figure  <dig>

rils with extreme root phenotypes

eleven genes were selected based on transcript abundance  from within the qtl intervals on chromosome  <dig> for the root diameter distribution based on length and thickness  three of these genes, kinesin like proteins, triglyceride lipase, and atp-dependent rna helicase showed higher expression in rils with the smallest root phenotypes. these three genes could represent prime candidate genes that play a critical role in regulating fine root development and distribution based on length and thickness. the additive effect taproot length qtl  involves interaction of gene on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> , both of which show high levels of expression in rils with extreme root phenotypes . non-synonymous mutations were present in both of these genes in v71- <dig> and pi <dig>  the genes in the qtl interval region for root thickness of  <dig> – <dig>  mm  and taproot length  showed higher expression in rils with roots smaller than the g. soja parent.

among the  <dig> genes selected in qtls based on the g. soja it <dig> sequence , only three genes  encoding peroxidase  and casp like protein showed differential gene expression associated with the root phenotype of the parents and rils . the missense mutations in these two peroxidase genes  might contribute to the higher levels of expression in g. soja than in g. max; however, this needs to be validated with further gene knockout experiments. one of the genes with a non-synonymous snp on chromosome  <dig>  glyma06g <dig>  encodes a nedd8-activating complex and showed an interesting pattern of expression in the rils, with higher expression in one of the high  and low extreme rils  . higher gene expression in both the extreme root phenotypes  could possibly be explained by an additive nature of the loci and their interaction  to produce a better parental root phenotype. however, other genes with deleterious mutations  showed significantly different expression patterns between parental lines. the lr <dig> line showed higher expression levels for most of the mutated genes identified in this study. even though these rils were selected based on allelic composition in this particular qtl confidence interval, they differed substantially for allelic composition within other regions of chromosome  <dig>  and at the whole genome level. thus, the gene expression in lr <dig>  with the smallest root size, may reflect the enrichment of the g. max-derived alleles at all these loci.



discussion
novel wild soybean alleles for the improvement of root system architecture
despite the narrow genetic base of cultivated soybeans  <cit> , previous root mapping studies  <cit>  successfully used intra-specific mapping populations to map root qtls in soybean. a recent study  <cit>  used a mapping population developed between the cultivar jingdou <dig> and a semi-wild cultivar, zdd <dig>  to identify genes and their regulation that control seedling coarse root traits. in the present study, we dissected the genetic variation for both coarse and fine roots using an inter-specific soybean mapping population. interestingly, the g. soja parent  alleles influenced the root traits of total root length and root volume, explaining a phenotypic variation of more than  <dig> per cent. similar contributions of positive alleles for root length and surface area qtls by a phosphorus inefficient genotype parental line were reported in an earlier study of soybean  <cit> . similar useful alleles for a number of agronomic traits were identified from g. soja accessions in previous studies  <cit> . the seedling root trait, total root length, and root volume  are highly correlated with drought and aluminum tolerance indices in soybean  <cit> . these traits determine the overall root growth rate and the plasticity of root architecture of plants, and are important for effective soil exploration to intercept nutrients, and for communication of stress cues  <cit> . a deeper root  is vital to improve drought tolerance and is positively correlated with yield under drought stress in both soybean  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . the total root length/surface area plays a crucial role in foraging and accumulation of phosphorus  <cit> , and also improves the limiting effect of phosphorus on shoot growth  <cit> . the qtl region on chromosome  <dig> identified in this study also harbors a domestication-related trait for 100-seed weight  <cit>  and seed yield  <cit> . this qtl region co-locates with another root qtl identified in other studies near satt357-satt <dig>  these markers flank the qtl for mean root length  <cit>  and yield  <cit>  that explained phenotypic variances of 26% and 8%, respectively. this region also possesses different aquaporin genes  that interact with other aquaporin family members on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

alleles from the g. max parent, v71- <dig>  also contributed to the development of fine root structure and distribution. studies focused on fine root structure in legume crops have used pulses  <cit> , but none have been completed in soybean. the fine root distribution, based on length, surface area, and volume, showed high positive correlation with total root volume. the distribution based on thickness was highly correlated with surface area only. small diameter roots reflect the proportion of fine lateral roots, which enhance the whole root surface area, acting as an exchange site between the plant and the soil  <cit> . in this study, several genes associated with different root architectural traits were identified, based on microarray analyses  and whole genome sequencing analysis of two g soja lines it <dig> and pi  <dig> . most of the root traits reported in this study were associated with the expression of one or polygenes. similar genetic regulation of root traits by major gene and polygenes was reported in soybean recently during seedling-stage development  <cit> . in the present study, most of the root traits showed a transgressive segregation pattern. a similar segregation pattern was reported for maximum root length and lateral root number in soybean  <cit> . however, tomato introgression lines developed between cultivated and wild tomatoes showed both transgressive and continuous patterns  <cit> . as the qtl regions identified governs both coarse and fine roots, these might be candidate regions to develop a better root ideotype in soybean.

among the  <dig> candidate genes  identified based on transcript abundance from the microarray analysis, kinesin was also found to be highly expressed in maize root tissues  <cit> . other genes, such as carboxylesterase  <dig> like and histone-like ccaat transcription factor, were also found to be highly expressed  in root pericycle cells, which regulate lateral root formation. these genes were also found to be upregulated in water-deficit conditions based on an affymetrix gene chip study  of different root regions. the carboxylesterase  <dig> like gene was highly upregulated under drought stress conditions in root region  <dig> . it was also upregulated in the root region  <dig>  following drought stress, but at lower levels compared with region  <dig>  the role of this gene in the maintenance of root growth during drought stress conditions has yet to be studied. candidate genes identified in the g. soja line, such as apoptosis inhibitor  <dig> related , slow anion channel associated 1-like , and metacaspase  , showed high expression in root-related tissues  and could be key candidates to improve root length and diameter in cultivated soybean, which might increase nutrient and water use efficiency. emphasis should be placed on characterizing the function of an uncharacterized gene, glyma15g <dig>  which is associated with soybean root system architecture, because it showed higher expression in rils with the shortest root length and surface area compared with rils with the longest root length. the sequence of this gene is similar to that of slow anion channel associated  <dig> in other crops, which is involved in osmoregulation, phosphorus uptake  <cit> , and aluminum tolerance  <cit> . it is also reported to be involved in regulating the exchange of water vapor and gas during drought stress  <cit> .

the genes with high levels of transcript abundance expressed only in root tissues within the qtl region of chromosomes  <dig>  had distinct expression patterns in the cultivated and g. soja parents. similar trends of gene expression were reported for genes related to stress, defense response, and redox pathways observed in wild soybean  <cit>  and wild tomato  <cit>  compared with their respective cultivated types. among the  <dig> genes identified based on sequence information from a wild soybean, two peroxidase genes  in different clades of the heat map showed high expression in the g. soja line . one of these peroxidase genes maps to a duplicated region  <cit>  and showed higher expression in the rils with small or larger root phenotypes. a similar trend of gene expression was observed in tomato introgression lines developed between cultivated and wild tomatoes  <cit> . this peroxidase gene in pi <dig> also had a non-synonymous snp variation that changed an amino acid from serine to alanine. similar effects on root size of amino acid changes were reported in the phosphorylation of the ethylene insensitive <dig> gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . zhu et al.  <cit>  reported that the peroxidase activity was spatiotemporal in root tissues and was involved in both cell wall loosening and tightening under water-deficit conditions. voothuluru and sharp  <cit>  also reported the effect of peroxidase genes on apoplastic reactive oxygen species in the root apical region and its effect on cell wall modification in maize roots as a part of a drought adaptive mechanism. the single copy genes identified in the present study could also be used as informative markers for phylogenetic and comparative analyses across various taxonomic levels  <cit> .

effect of non-synonymous snp mutations on root architecture
our results indicated that non-synonymous snp mutations in genes underlying the qtl region on chromosome  <dig> are critical candidate genes to study root growth and development. in particular, we identified the gene encoding nedd8-activating complex, a thif protein family  that is associated with production of ubiquitin-activating enzyme e <dig> , which controls phosphate starvation responses through shoot and root modifications. this gene showed higher expression in wild soybean pi  <dig> and the hr <dig> ril with higher total root length and surface area. this expression pattern indicated that the transcriptional landscape of g. soja lines was highly diverged relative to cultivated soybean at this particular locus. the homologous gene to nedd8-activating complex also showed higher expression in wild tomatoes than in cultivated tomatoes, as a result of accelerated evolution  <cit> . the hr <dig> ril’s higher expression for this gene might have occurred as a result of the interaction between the g. soja-derived mutated allele  and the g. max-derived allele and para-mutating its effect. similar mechanisms underlying the gene expression levels were observed in a maize inter-mated mapping population  <cit> . thus, this transcript with high expression from wild soybeans is a candidate to increase root length through coordinating cell division and elongation dynamics, as has been reported in wild tomatoes  <cit> . the tpr transcription factor, with a non-synonymous mutation, was identified among a number of g. soja accessions  and showed similar expression patterns in both parental lines and rils. a similar class of transcription factor was reported to be expressed in roots as an early response to iron availability in soybeans  <cit> . mutations of key genes with insertions or deletions associated with rate of cell divisions  might result in the shorter root phenotypes in g. soja, pi <dig>  compared with v71- <dig>  sequences derived from other g. soja accessions  <cit>  also showed the same non-synonymous snp in these same genes. as a result, the altered protein products of these two genes might have resulted in shooter root phenotypes in all wild soybeans. similar molecules were reported in arabidopsis and rice to influence cortex-endodermis division regulated by the short-root transcription factor  <cit> .

comparative genomic analysis among g. soja accessions
based on the whole genome re-sequence, information from  <dig> accessions, which represent diverse g. soja accessions from korea  <cit>  and china  <cit> , also showed conserved non-synonymous snps in most of the root related genes identified in this study . among different plant species, soybeans are reported to have a higher average ratio of nonsyn/syn snps than arabidopsis and rice, with larger effect snps in  <dig>  genes that have greater effects on their functions  <cit> . in addition, 21% of potential snp loci were fixed during the domestication process from wild soybeans. therefore, the genes identified in the present study might represent candidates with high biological significance for root system growth and development. these genes may play a key role in maintaining short root phenotypes of wild soybeans. a strong candidate for further study is the auxin responsive gene, nedd8-activating complex, because it influences the total root length and involves a key hormone, auxin, which regulates the root growth and development. in arabidopsis, this gene interacts with a cullin gene, which then alters the growth of lateral roots and root hairs  <cit> . similar results were observed in elite lines of rice in which snps altered the expression of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene associated with the aba content. a rice line with this missense mutation had produced more lateral roots  <cit> . for the uncharacterized gene , a gain of a stop codon in the g. soja pi  <dig> makes this a potential candidate gene to further study the functional effects associated with root development in soybeans. therefore, the root-related genes with non-synonymous mutations identified in this study are a valuable genetic resource to study the evolution of root system development in soybeans. the candidate genes identified from the g. soja accession, pi  <dig>  are promising targets to improve root system architecture in cultivated soybeans. however, rils with soja alleles show undesirable phenotypes, such as lodging and poor yield, which could be eliminated by a series of backcrosses with the cultivated soybean, v71- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the qtl regions on chromosome  <dig> for total root length and root volume, and the qtls on chromosome  <dig> for finer roots will enable us to integrate improvements in root architecture in soybean. the candidate genes associated with root traits, and with non-synonymous mutations are valuable genetic resources for understanding the evolution of the longer root phenotype in cultivated soybeans compared with the short roots found in most g. soja accessions. the genes identified in this study will be important for understanding the molecular mechanisms and gene regulation associated with root development. these findings also suggest that combining novel rare alleles from wild soybean with those of cultivated soybeans could be used to modify/alter the rsa of cultivated soybeans and also develop a soybean that is suited to soils with varying nutrient and water availabilities.
