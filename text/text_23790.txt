BACKGROUND
recently, genes that confer resistance  to different types of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and nematodes, have been cloned by map-based cloning and transposon tagging procedures  <cit> . apart from the hm <dig> and mlo genes  <cit> , amino acid sequence comparison analyses from cloned r genes revealed that they are highly structurally conserved, such as the previously reported conserved domains leucine zipper , nbs, lrr, transmembrane , and serine/threonine protein kinases   <cit> . of these cloned r genes, the largest group consists of the nbs-lrr family, which is characterized by an n-terminal nbs and c-terminal lrrs. based on the presence or absence of a toll and interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain at the n-terminus of plant nbs-lrr r genes, they were divided into two subclasses:  tir-nbs-lrr, and;  non-tir-nbs-lrr type  <cit> . in addition, the last residue of the kinase- <dig> motif of identified nbs-lrr r genes, d  or w , has also been used to predict  whether they belong to the tir or non-tir subclass of nbs-lrr r genes  <cit> .

eight conserved motifs have been identified in the nbs domains of known nbs-lrr r genes  <cit> . some are specific to the non-tir or the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, such as rnbs-a-tir and rnbs-d-tir in the tir subclass, and rnbs-a-nontir and rnbs-d-nontir in the nontir subclass  <cit> . other conserved motifs such as p-loop , kinase- <dig>  kinase-3a, and glpl are widely present in both classes. conserved motifs in such resistance genes in different plants offer a way to isolate rgas related to other resistance genes. currently, rgas isolated using this approach have been obtained extensively by pcr amplification, with degenerate primers designed based on the conserved domain of nbs-lrr, such as potatoes  <cit> , soybeans  <cit> , lettuce  <cit> , barley  <cit> , coffee  <cit> , sunflower  <cit> , strawberry  <cit> , and ginger  <cit> . many cloned rgas are either closely linked to known r gene loci or are arranged in clusters similar to r genes. consequently, degenerate rcr could be a promising approach that may facilitate the isolation of resistance genes.

downy mildew  is a disease that infects cucumber  worldwide, where it can be devastating to european  <cit>  and north american growers  <cit> . in china, it can cause yield loss of up to 10~30% in a regular year, or more than 80% during an epidemic year  <cit> . recently, a downy mildew epidemic infected cucumber plants in north carolina and the delmarva peninsula of new jersey. the epidemic started in florida and found its way to locations as far away as michigan, ohio, and then ontario, canada. the outbreak was evidence that some of the previously identified resistance genes  did not provide adequate disease control  <cit> . further, several fungicides that should have provided control were ineffective because of the new pathogenicity of p. cubensis. therefore, improving the genetic resistance of cucumber to downy mildew through plant breeding could be an effective way to control this disease. the narrow genetic base of modern cucumber cultivars and few sources of resistance make downy mildew resistance an important objective in cucumber-breeding programs. therefore, the identification of new sources of resistance to downy mildew is desirable  <cit> .

high resistance exists in wild cucumis species  <cit> . since  <dig>  major efforts to create interspecific hybrids by introgression of alien disease resistant genes from exotic germplasm into elite lines have been unsuccessful  <cit> . however, we have carried out a successful interspecific hybridization between c. hystrix chakr.  and cucumber   <cit> . in previous studies, extensive deoxyribonucleic acid  introgression from c. hystrix in the progenies from the subsequent backcrossing of interspecific hybrid species  to c. sativus was observed  <cit> . of the germplasms developed by alien introgression, line il5211s  with downy mildew resistance was identified  <cit>  that has potential to improve the incorporation of cucumber resistance to disease.

the goals of this research were to isolate rgas related to downy mildew resistance from line il5211s based on degenerate primers designed from the conserved domains of the nbs-lrr of cloned r genes in plants, and to elucidate their character and genetic diversity. the transcriptional expression of putative csrga associated with downy mildew resistance after infection with p. cubensis and treatment molecules including meja, sa, aba, and h2o <dig> was further investigated by qrt-pcr.

RESULTS
amplification and cloning of csrgas from il5211s
using a pair of degenerate primers, primer-r and primer-f, from previously published literature  <cit> , a band of the predicted size  was observed by pcr amplification . the fragment was inserted into a pgem-t vector, and  <dig> recombinant clones were randomly selected and sequenced. subsequently, a homology search was carried out for each of the  <dig> clone sequences using the blastx search in genbank. twenty-eight sequences were found to have a high sequence similarity with known r genes and rgas from other plant species . the remaining clones gave either sequence similarity with retrotransposon sequence or no match with r genes. these clones were not analyzed further in this paper.

a the region between the p-loop and glpla motifs  of each cucumber rga was used as a query in blastx searches.

sequence analysis
blastx searches found that the highest degree of identity between the  <dig> sequences and the known n resistance gene protein, rgas from c. melo, reached  <dig>  and 87%, respectively . blastp searches of the deduced amino acid sequences of  <dig> sequences revealed the presence of the nr-arc  domain. further sequence analysis revealed the presence of no-stop codons or frameshift mutations in these sequences. therefore, they were defined as csrgas.

in addition, sequence analysis found that amino acid substitutions occur in the nbs conserved domains in il5211s. for example, the "v" residues of the conserved p-loop motif of most cloned csrgas was replaced by other residues . the "l" residue of the glpl motif of csrga <dig> and csrga <dig> was substituted for both "fs." the amino acid substitutions of other conserved domains were also observed.

multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis
multiple alignment between the  <dig> csrgas and known r genes including n , l <dig> , m , prf , gpa <dig> , and rpm <dig>  revealed the presence of conserved domains such as p-loop, rnbs-a-tir, rnbs-a-nontir, kinase <dig>  rnbs-b, and glpl . previous studies found that the p-loop, rnas-b, and glpl motifs were conserved in both tir and non-tir nbs-lrr resistance proteins, whereas the rnbs-a tir  and rnbs-a nontir  motifs were found in the tir and non-tir nbs-lrr resistance proteins, respectively  <cit> . in addition, the amino acid residue at the end of kinase <dig> is also a characteristic feature of tir and non-tir nbs-lrr resistance proteins. tryptophan  corresponds to the non-tir subclass of nbs-lrr resistance genes. in contrast, aspartic acid  corresponds to the tir subclass. the method could be used to predict  whether these resistance genes belong to the tir or non-tir subclass of nbs-lrr resistance genes  <cit> . adopting these criteria, all csrgas cloned reported herein were divided into non-tir and tir subclasses. the former includes csrga <dig>  csrga <dig>  csrga <dig>  csrga <dig>  and csrga <dig>  the remaining  <dig> csrgas belong to the tir subclass.

to explain the relationship of cloned csrgas and known r genes from other species, a phylogenic tree was constructed using mega <dig>  software  <cit> . the genes were divided into two subgroups , which is consistent with our results. within the tir-nbs-lrr class, the csrgas are divided into three subclasses, designated as csrga i to csrga iii . in the non-tir-nbs-lrr class, the csrgas were clustered in one group, designated csrga iv.

pairwise comparisons between the subclasses ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % at the nucleotide level and  <dig>  to  <dig> % at the amino acid level, suggesting a high degree of divergence and encoding a larger family of proteins with the nbs domain in il5211s. compared with known r genes, the sequence homology ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % at the nucleotide level and  <dig>  to  <dig> % at the amino acid level, respectively . the subclasses i and iv consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> members of csrgas, respectively. the remaining three subclasses included one member, reflecting a difference in abundance for these csrga subclasses in the cucumber genome .

analysis of the four groups of csrga gene expression
to detect the expression of the four groups of csrgas in il5211s, one csrga representative of each group, namely, csrga <dig>  csrga <dig>  csrga <dig>  and csrga <dig>  was used in further analyses. four primer pairs were employed to amplify from il5211s using genomic dna and complementary dna  as the template . the eight fragments obtained using these combinations were then cloned, and three clones of each were sequenced. sequence comparisons indicated that no differences existed between the sequences amplified using genomic dna and cdna as template and original sequences, respectively. thus, these results suggest that by using these four primers, the difference in expression levels observed could be attributable to the response to each of the csrga genes examined.

differential expressions of the four classes of csrgas in different organs of il5211s
to examine the expression levels of the four classes of csrgas in different plant organs from il5211s, one csrga representative of each class was randomly chosen for expression analysis using rt-pcr. results demonstrated that csrga <dig> was expressed in the leaves, stems, and roots at high levels, that csrga <dig> was expressed at relatively low levels, and the remaining two csrgas  were expressed at intermediate levels. the expression level of the csrga <dig> gene in the leaves of il5211s was also found to be significantly higher than that of the other three csrgas .

effects of introgression from c. hystrix on the four csrga transcription levels
to investigate whether alien dna introgression from c. hystrix induced the expression of the four csrgas genes studied, qrt-pcr was used to analyze and compare their expression level in the wild relative, c. hystrix, the backcross-derived elite parent, "beijingjietou," and line il5211s. the results are presented in figure  <dig>  it indicates that csrga <dig> and csrga <dig> exhibited no remarkable changes in the transcription levels in il5211s, c. hystrix, and cc <dig>  in contrast, csrga <dig> and csrga <dig> showed differential expression. the expression level of csrga <dig> was about twice as high as observed in cc <dig>  the level of csrga <dig> expression was four times higher than that of cc <dig>  these results showed that introgression of c. hystrix induced expression of partial csrgas. furthermore, the expression level of csrga <dig> was found to be higher than that of csrga <dig> in il5211s, indicating that the role of csrga <dig> may be more important than csrga <dig> in enhancing downy mildew resistance in il5211s.

induction of csrga <dig> expression in response to p. cubensis and defense signaling molecules
to understand the nature of csrga <dig> transcripts, the induction of csrga <dig> expression in response to p. cubensis and defense signaling molecules was examined by qrt-pcr . following infection by p. cubensis, the transcription of csrga <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher at  <dig> h after inoculation. it increased to  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h and peaked at  <dig> h . then the level of csrga <dig> expression decreased by  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h. this result suggests that csrga <dig> might be involved in the defense response to p. cubensis.

previous studies have shown that sa and ja are signaling molecules involved in the activation of pathogenesis-related gene expression  <cit>  and defense-related gene expression  <cit> , respectively. recent studies indicated that other hormones such as aba are also involved in plant defense signaling pathways. in addition, h2o <dig> has been confirmed as a second messenger in activating defense gene expression  <cit>  and is one of the earliest plant responses in incompatible interactions between pathogens and plants  <cit> .

to evaluate whether expression of csrga <dig> was induced by various combinations of p. cubense infection with potential resistance inducing chemicals, the level of the csrga <dig> transcript in il5211s leaves following exogenous application of sa, meja, aba, and h2o <dig> was studied by qrt-pcr analysis. following sa treatment, transcription of csrga <dig> occurred and reached  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h after treatment. the expression of csrga <dig> increased to  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h and peaked at  <dig> h. after this, the expression level decreased but was still at  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h post-treatment, which is higher than the background .

exposure to meja, caused csrga <dig> transcription to increase rapidly to  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h compared to initial exposure expression and this same level was maintained  at  <dig> h, and peaked  at  <dig> h. however, csrga transcription decreased abruptly after  <dig> h, at  <dig> -fold, fell to  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively .

induction of csrga <dig> occurred rapidly after treatment with aba. the expression level of csrga <dig> increased  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h, peaked at  <dig> h , then decreased to  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h and had a minimal increase at  <dig> h compared to pre-exposure levels. after this, the expression level again decreased to  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h .

in response to h2o <dig> treatment, the expression level of csrga <dig> peaked at  <dig> -fold higher  <dig> h, than that at  <dig> h. then the expression of the gene decreased steadily:  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h,  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h,  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h, and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h .

taken together, the strong induction of csrga <dig> by exogenous application of meja, sa, h2o <dig>  aba, and the observed p. cubensis infection, suggesting that csrga <dig> might be involved in defense responses via a signaling the pathway activated by these molecules.

discussion
based on the successful interspecific hybridation between c. hystrix and c. sativus, high resistance to downy mildew cucumber il was identified through cytogenetics and molecular genetics combined with p. cubensis inoculation  <cit> . to use the source of resistance to downy mildew fully, the determination of its defense mechanism in response to p. cubensis is necessary. in this paper, based on the conserved domains of plant nbs-lrr resistance genes, a pair of degenerate primers were used to amplify its homolog gene from il5211s by pcr. twenty-eight csrgas were successfully obtained.

sequence alignment found that csrgas proteins have a highly conserved nr-arc domain containing p-loop/kinase-1a, kinase- <dig>  and kinase-3a, and glpl subdomains characteristic of most plant rgas and r genes. in addition, according to the principle that the w residue is found in non-tir proteins, and the d residue is only in tir-containing proteins,  <dig> out of  <dig>  of the csrgas examined in this work belonged to the tir-nbs-lrr type. the remaining four csrgas belonged to the nontir-nbs-lrr type. this distribution is commonly found in arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit>  and also supports the view that both tir-nbs-lrr and that non-tir-nbs-lrr r-genes occur in dicot species  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree separated csrgas into four subgroups belonging to two classes of the nbs-lrr sequence, which agrees with the results of our classification method.

to elucidate the expressed patterns of four csrgas in the different tissues from il5211s, they were analyzed using qrt-pcr. figure  <dig> shows that the expression levels of the four csrgas are different in the roots, stems, and leaves of il5211s. the expression level of csrga <dig> was higher in leaves than in roots or stems. the expression levels of csrga <dig>  csrga <dig>  and csrga <dig> were highest in the stems, leaves, and roots, respectively.

the effects of introgression from c. hystrix on the four csrgas transcription levels were further investigated. the levels of the csrga <dig> and csrga <dig> transcript are almost the same among the distant relative c. hystrix, cc <dig>  and il5211s. the expression of csrga <dig> and csrga <dig> in il5211s were induced by genetic factors originating from c. hystrix. the expression level of csrga <dig> is four-fold higher than that of cc <dig>  these results show that introgression from c. hystrix caused a partial change in csrga expression. the enhanced expression level of csrga <dig> may be associated with downy mildew resistance in il5211s.

most plant resistance genes are transcriptionally regulated in response to pathogen attack. however, due to low expression levels, transcripts can be difficult to detect using gel blot analysis  <cit> . the transcription of the rice xa <dig> resistance gene appears to increase following pathogen inoculation  <cit> . this indicates that the transcription of the r gene depends on the type of plant-pathogen interaction. in this study, the expression patterns of csrga <dig> were investigated to gain insight into its involvement in plant defense response . infection with p. cubensis significantly enhanced the expression level of csrga <dig>  suggesting a correlation between activating this gene and resistance to p. cubensis. thus, csrga <dig> might be involved in p. cubensis-induced defense response. similar expression patterns have been observed for pib and hs1pro- <dig>  a blast resistance gene in rice  <cit>  and a nematode-resistance gene in sugar beet  <cit> , respectively.

previously, some studies have reported that signaling molecules not only function as a critical signal for downstream resistance events but also upregulate the expression of r genes. for example, in arabidopsis, the study had shown that sa treatment induced the expression of ssi <dig>  encoding a putative protein belonging to the tir-nbs-lrr class of r proteins, and the closely related tir-nbs-lrr genes rpp <dig> and rps <dig>  <cit> . treatment with sa also increases the transcription of rpw <dig>  and rpw <dig> , induces spontaneous hr-like lesions , and enhances resistance to powdery mildews  <cit> . in sugarcane and soybean, it has also been found that expression of the nbs-lrr class of resistance genes were induced by exogenous sa treatment and wounding  <cit> . in grapevines, of the vvmlo genes tested, the vvmlo <dig> and vvmlo <dig> genes showed over 50-fold higher transcript levels upon h2o <dig> treatment, while vvmlo <dig>  vvmlo <dig> and vvmlo <dig> genes displayed the most marked response to sa treatment  <cit> . however, some researchers have also expressed opposite views. for example, expression of ha-ntir11g and hs1pro- <dig>  were not induced by exogenous signaling molecules . in this study, the p. cubensis-inducible csrga <dig> gene was activated not only by sa but also by other defense-signaling molecules  , suggesting that these stimuli induce the expression of the csrga <dig> gene and that csrga <dig> may play a potential role in mediating cross-talk between defense-signaling pathways.

several studies also report that sa and ja act antagonistically in defense reactions  <cit> . however, more recent studies indicate that they act synergistically  <cit> . in this paper, expression of csrga <dig> was induced by sa and meja, suggesting that the two stimuli have synergistic role in mediating defense responses in il5211s. however, the csrga <dig> gene transcript-induced patterns were distinct. the csrga <dig> transcript-induced peak by sa occurred at  <dig> h and increased  <dig> -fold over  <dig> h, whereas the transcript peak  induced by meja appeared at  <dig> h, suggesting that csrga <dig> might be mainly involved in the defense responses through signaling the pathway activated by these two molecules at different time points.

taken together, these results suggest that the csrga <dig> gene is activated in il5211s during infection by p. cubensis, and that it is induced by signal transduction pathways that mediated by sa, meja, aba, and h2o <dig>  given the prominent role csrga <dig> proteins play in il5211s defense responses, further examination of their function is necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> csrgas obtained by the homologue-sequence method provided the foundation for developing molecular markers and insight into downy mildew resistance formation. this contributes to our understanding of the organization of the nbs-lrr r gene in il5211s, which may in turn result in future cloning of this "novel" downy mildew resistance gene.
