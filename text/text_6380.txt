BACKGROUND
in vitro analyses of host cell/pathogen interactions are essential to unravel the mechanisms of infection and to investigate the host response to infection. pseudorabies virus  belongs to the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily as for example the human herpes simplex virus  <dig>  and is a well-known pig pathogen responsible for aujeszky's disease, causing considerable economical losses worldwide in this species  <cit> . although some countries have succeeded in eradicating aujeszky's disease through vaccination and health policies, the disease prevalence still remains variable in other countries. young piglets are more severely affected by prv infection often resulting in fatal encephalitis, than older infected pigs, which can remain asymptomatic or develop mild to severe respiratory disease symptoms associated with a limited mortality. indeed, prv displays a strong tropism for epithelial cells of the oronasal respiratory tract, which are the first cells targeted by virions  <cit> . abortions, stillbirths or weak piglets that die within  <dig> h of birth are also observed when pregnant sows are infected  <cit> . moreover, prv can infect a broad range of vertebrates resulting in a uniform lethality but it is generally considered as a non-pathogenic agent for man  <cit> . because prv is easy to propagate in cells of several mammalian species including rodents and is not harmful to laboratory workers, prv is a highly relevant model to study the biology of alphaherpesviruses and their interactions with host cells in vitro  <cit> . in addition, its genome has been reconstructed from sequences of six different strains  and  <dig> genes encoding structural and non structural proteins have been annotated  <cit> .

viruses have evolved strategies to evade the host immune response. in particular, herpesviruses interfere with the major histocompatibility complex  class i antigen presentation pathway to avoid the cytotoxic t lymphocyte  response  <cit> . mhc class i molecules are expressed on almost all nucleated cells and present peptides, including peptides derived from viral antigens, to ctl, which play a critical role in the defense mechanisms against viral infection. it has been reported that prv infection decreases the expression of mhc class i molecules on the cell surface  <cit> . this down-regulation is partly explained by the inhibition of the abc transporter tap activity, due to interactions with the viral gn protein encoded by the ul <dig>  gene  <cit> . this inhibition is independent of the non-specific mrna cellular shut-off produced by the virion host shut-off  protein encoded by the ul <dig> gene  <cit> . however, mechanisms other than tap inhibition may be involved in avoiding the mhc class i presentation pathway.

a precise and more complete identification of cellular and viral genes, which are up- or down-regulated during the time course of infection, is essential to better understand the physiopathology of infection and to identify the molecules involved in host resistance/susceptibility mechanisms. during recent years, dna microarray technology has proven to be a very efficient high-throughput tool to study the gene expression profiles of infected host cells or pathogens  <cit> . to date, three transcriptomic analyses focused on cellular gene expression have been carried out in non-porcine prv infected cells  <cit> . ray and enquist have compared the cellular pathways regulated by prv and hsv- <dig> during infection of rat embryonic fibroblast cells using a rat microarray  <cit> . in a similar system, brukman and enquist have explored how prv evades the ifn-mediated immune response  <cit> . finally, blanchard et al have used a human microarray to characterize the impact of prv infection in human embryonic kidney cells   <cit> . these studies have identified many biological processes and host cell genes regulated during infection. the next step in a transcriptomic approach would be the simultaneous analysis of viral and cellular modifications of transcription during prv infection  <cit>  using porcine genomic tools. since the pig whole genome assembly is not yet achieved, no complete pan-genomic array exists and only partial generic microarrays are commercially available  <cit> . however, the pig mhc region referred to as the sla  complex, located on chromosome  <dig>  is the first region of the pig genome that is entirely sequenced and annotated  <cit> .

in this context, our aim was to study the dialogue between prv and the pk <dig> porcine epithelial cell line, which mimics the first porcine target cells. using two different porcine microarrays, we followed both the viral and cellular transcriptome kinetics during infection. these microarrays were the qiagen-nrsp <dig> commercial array  <cit>  and a microarray we constructed, referred to as sla/prv, which combines probe sets specific to genes localized in the sla complex, genes encoding other important immunological molecules  <cit>  and all the prv genes. here, we present a large-scale analysis of the porcine physiological pathways regulated during viral infection with a special focus on genes in the sla complex together with the modifications of the prv transcriptome.

RESULTS
construction of the sla/prv microarray and complementarity with the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray
the  <dig> dna/cdna probes spotted on the sla/prv microarray fall into four distinct probe sets: i)  <dig> probes localized on a segment of chromosome  <dig> between the loci prl and prim2a , which includes the extended-sla region and represents  <dig> unique sequences,  <dig> belonging to the strict sla region between the loci ubd and ring <dig>  <cit> ; ii)  <dig> probes specific to  <dig> genes encoding molecules involved in immunity and localized outside the sla region  <cit> ; iii)  <dig> prv probes specific to the  <dig> viral genes  and iv)  <dig> probes randomly chosen for data normalization from porcine cdna agenae library  <cit> . the prv/sla microarray covers  <dig> % of the annotated sequences of the strict sla region   <cit> .

the qiagen-nrsp <dig> oligonucleotide microarray contains  <dig> probes, which match  <dig> unique human or mouse refseq or pig annotated gene ncbi accession numbers and  <dig> % of these encode immune proteins  <cit> . only  <dig> of the  <dig> probes from the extended sla probe set and  <dig> of the  <dig> from the immune probe set are present on both microarrays.

expression of prv genes during the time course of infection
the six time points, which were studied in this experiment â€“ i.e.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours  post-infection , were chosen according to viral growth kinetics observed in pk <dig> cells in our experimental conditions . the expression of viral genes was detected between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi and increased during time and most of the genes were expressed at  <dig> and  <dig> h pi. the hierarchical clustering  of viral gene expression levels according to all conditions  allowed us to distinguish two main groups: i) mock-infection at all time points and infection until  <dig> h pi ii) infection from  <dig> until  <dig> h . with the k-means method, we identified three transcript clusters with similar expression profiles . the average expression levels for the first cluster  showed little variation and only from  <dig> h pi. the second cluster contained  <dig> probes corresponding to genes, the expression level of which increased from  <dig> h pi. the last group  displayed a higher increase of expression level from  <dig> to  <dig> h pi.

using a linear model and student t tests, the analysis of viral genes, which were differentially expressed between infected and mock-infected cells at each time pi  indicated that three differentially expressed probes were observed as soon as  <dig> h pi and that this number increased drastically between  <dig> and  <dig> h  and reached a plateau after  <dig> h pi . the important increase between  <dig> and  <dig> h confirmed the hcl and k-means results and correlated with the prv growth curve . nineteen probes were not differentially expressed between infected and mock-infected cells at any time and  <dig> of them were found in the less variable cluster by the k-means method . most of the differentially expressed probes belonged to the two most variable clusters. among the  <dig> differentially expressed probes,  <dig> recognized two to four transcripts and  <dig> were specific to a single transcript . when examining these latter  <dig> genes, the first differentially expressed genes observed  <dig> h pi were us <dig> and ul <dig> encoding two non structural proteins rsp <dig> and icp <dig>  respectively, and ul <dig>  encoding the virion envelope glycoprotein gn. however, ie <dig> encoding the immediate early protein iep, a transactivator of early gene expression was found differentially expressed at  <dig> h pi. moreover, the four genes, which were differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> h, specify non structural , capsid , tegument  and envelope  transcripts. the differential expression of ul <dig> encoding vhs protein was first detected at  <dig> h pi. among the probes recognizing two transcripts, pknia <dig> specific of us3min and us3maj involved in the inhibition of apoptosis was also differentially expressed from  <dig> h pi and ul <dig> specific of ul37min and ul37maj encoding a tegument protein was differentially expressed at  <dig> h pi.

global pk <dig> differential gene expression during the time course of infection
the number of differentially expressed cellular probes increased with time in parallel to viral gene expression . between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi most of the sla/immune probes showed no change and few differentially expressed genes were detected from  <dig> h pi with the qiagen-nrps <dig> microarray . as shown in table  <dig>  the sla/prv microarray identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed probes at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h pi, respectively  and the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> differentially expressed probes at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h pi , respectively. the sla/prv microarray data show that  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %  of the differentially expressed probes were down-regulated at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h pi, respectively and the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray data show that  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %  of the differentially expressed probes explored in this case were down-regulated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h pi, respectively . with the k-means method, the expression levels for each condition  of the sla/prv differentially expressed probes set were clustered in three groups . eighty-eight probes with a small decrease in expression levels from  <dig> h pi were found in the first cluster and  <dig> probes with a stronger decrease in expression levels from  <dig> h pi in the second cluster. the third cluster contained  <dig> up-regulated probes at  <dig> h pi. the results obtained with both microarrays show that many cellular genes were down-regulated during the time course of the experiment especially between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi.

prv infection alters multiple biological processes and cellular functions
for each time point, the differentially expressed genes from the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray were classified into biological processes using go terms when available . the biological processes that contained more than 5% of the differentially expressed genes during the period between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi included: protein metabolism and modification , nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism , developmental process , signal transduction , transport , cell cycle , immunity and defense , intracellular protein traffic  and cell structure and motility . several biological processes were predominantly regulated  <dig> h pi such as developmental processes  and signal transduction . other biological processes were regulated later such as cell adhesion  or apoptosis  from  <dig> h pi and homeostasis  from  <dig> h pi.

the ingenuity pathway analysis  of the differentially expressed probes from the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray identified  <dig> different top functions associated with significant networks . three top functions were regulated early during infection : gene expression, molecular transport and drug metabolism. sixteen,  <dig> and  <dig> top functions were modulated by prv infection at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h pi. fifteen and  <dig> top functions were specific of time points  <dig> and  <dig> h pi, respectively. the number of regulated top functions strongly increased from  <dig> h pi. the top functions containing the highest number of focus genes at both  <dig> and  <dig> h pi were those involved in cancer, cell cycle and cell signaling with the first two detected as early as  <dig> h pi. immune response and immunological disease top functions were found from  <dig> h pi and immune and lymphatic system development and function at  <dig> h pi. cell death top function was first detected at  <dig> h pi.

prv infection modifies the expression of genes involved in mhc antigenic presentation pathways
the expression of many genes belonging to the sla class i antigenic presentation pathway was modulated during prv infection according to the results of both microarrays . sla ia genes were down-regulated from  <dig> h pi with the sla/prv microarray and from  <dig> h pi with the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray. tap <dig> and tap <dig> genes, encoding molecules involved in peptide transport from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, were also down-regulated  <dig> h pi according to the results of the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray. surprisingly, tap <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> h pi with the sla/prv microarray. psmb <dig> , one of the genes encoding immunoproteasome molecules was up-regulated from  <dig> h pi on the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray.

unexpectedly, our results show that transcript levels of genes belonging to the mhc class ii antigenic presentation pathway were also modulated during prv infection. expression of sla-dob and sla-dmb decreased at  <dig> h pi according to the results from the sla/prv microarray . sla-dmb was also down-regulated with the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray  <dig> h pi while sla-doa, sla-dqa <dig> and ciita were up-regulated at this time point .

immune response, apoptosis, nucleic acid binding and actin cytoskeleton pathways are modulated during prv infection
among all the biological processes  and top functions , shown to be regulated during prv infection, we examined in greater detail genes differentially expressed in four pathways i.e. immune response, apoptosis, nucleic acid binding and actin cytoskeleton .

for genes involved in immune response, we observed that cd <dig> and cd <dig> were up- and down-regulated from  <dig> h pi, respectively  and that several chemokine ligand and interleukin genes such as il12a, il12b and il <dig> were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h pi. these observations have a poor biological significance. since the relevant gene products are known to be specific of immune cells, it is probable that these transcript expressions are not correlated with significant protein synthesis in the present epithelial cell context. among the genes involved in interferon-mediated immunity, many were modulated during prv infection  i.e. ifnar <dig> and ifi <dig> transcript levels increased from  <dig> h pi and isgf3g transcript levels at  <dig> h pi. the expression of irf <dig>  irf2and irf <dig> appeared down-regulated from  <dig> h pi and that of irf <dig> at  <dig> h pi. ifna <dig>  ifi <dig> were down-regulated  <dig> h pi while ifng, which was included in the sla/prv probe set, was not detected as a differentially expressed gene. in addition, the expression of tlr <dig>  involved in recognition of viral nucleic acid binding was decreased at  <dig> h pi. immunophilin genes were also regulated during infection. from  <dig> h pi ppia  was down-regulated  and at  <dig> h pi ppif and ppig were down-regulated while ppih was up-regulated.

for the apoptosis pathway, genes belonging to the bcl- <dig> molecule family, faim <dig>  casp <dig> and casp <dig> were down-regulated whereas casp <dig> and nf-kb <dig> were up-regulated. transcript levels of jak <dig>  xbp <dig>  atf <dig> and hspa <dig> were decreased at  <dig> h pi. hspa1a, hspa1b, hspa <dig>  hspa <dig>  hspa4k and hspa <dig> were up-regulated at  <dig> h pi and eif2a from  <dig> h pi. hspa <dig> was first down-regulated at  <dig> h pi and then up-regulated from  <dig> h pi. several differentially expressed genes, which belong to the apoptosis pathway, were also involved in the stress response.

among the differentially expressed genes that play a role in nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid binding, the expression of histone genes hist1h2al, hist1h4j, hist1h2bk was decreased from  <dig> h pi. expression of several histone deacetylases was also regulated during infection: hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> expression levels increased, while hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  and hdac <dig> expression decreased. hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> were regulated early from  <dig> h pi. several genes encoding signal transducers and activators of transcription  were down-regulated during prv infection.

within the actin cytoskeleton pathway, actg <dig> was up-regulated very early i.e. as soon as  <dig> h pi. other genes such as actc <dig>  actrt <dig>  acta <dig>  myo1d and myo5a were all down-regulated from  <dig> or  <dig> h pi and actl6a was up-regulated at  <dig> h pi.

validation of microarray results by quantitative real-time pcr 
five genes involved in the presentation antigen class i pathway were studied by qrt-pcr: sla ia, tap <dig>  tap <dig>  psmb <dig> and psmb <dig>  ppia, down-regulated during infection, and tnf, even if not detected as differentially expressed in our transcriptome experiment, were also chosen for validation . qrt-pcr were performed for a subset of conditions at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h pi . we confirmed that sla ia genes were down-regulated during infection from  <dig> h pi. we also observed a clear down-regulation of tap <dig> and tap <dig> from  <dig> and  <dig> h pi, respectively. an early down-regulation of psmb <dig> and psmb <dig> was detected before  <dig> h pi. tnf was strongly up-regulated from  <dig> h pi and ppia was down-regulated from  <dig> h pi.

cell surface expression of mhc class i and mhc class ii molecules on pk <dig> cells during prv infection
since our experiments, as well as other studies  <cit> , have clearly indicated a down-regulation of the mhc class i genes during prv infection, we checked, by flow cytometry, for a down-regulation of surface mhc class i molecules on prv infected pk <dig> cells at  <dig> h pi. to visualize infected cells, we used, in the same experimental conditions, a recombinant prv strain  expressing the green fluorescent protein . ninety percent of the cells appeared infected and 73% of these infected cells expressed surface mhc class i molecules on their surface while  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the mock-infected cells expressed mhc class i molecules at  <dig> and  <dig> h pi, respectively . the mhc class i mean fluorescence intensity of infected cells at  <dig> h pi was  <dig> % of that of mock-infected cells  thus confirming a clear decrease of mhc class i molecules expression on the surface of infected cells . as a control, we observed that the expression of tubulin, detected by western blot, remains unchanged even  <dig> h pi in pk <dig> cells .

since a significant variation in mhc class ii transcript levels during infection was detected in our transcriptome analysis, we also analyzed the expression of mhc class ii molecules on the surface of pk <dig> cells. our results show that  <dig> % of mock-infected cells  and infected cells  expressed surface mhc class ii molecules. however, we could not detect any differential expression between infected and mock-infected cells at  <dig> h pi.

discussion
a joint prv-porcine epithelial cell transcriptomic approach
this work is the first study of prv transcriptome expression during the time course of infection. moreover, it is the first time that the gene expressions of both prv  and porcine cells during infection are analyzed simultaneously and we demonstrate that virus and host cell transcriptome modifications can be examined with a unique microarray combining viral and host cell probe sets. indeed, a majority of transcriptomic studies have focused either on host or on pathogen gene expression profiling  <cit>  and only a few studies report the simultaneous detection of pathogen and mammalian host transcriptomes i.e. plasmodium berghei anka and mouse  <cit>  and ebv-nk/t cell lymphoma and man  <cit> . our work confirms the feasibility and the relevance of this kind of approach to establish a direct link between pathogen and cellular gene expression. in order to explore porcine cellular gene expression with even more detail, we chose to supplement the sla/prv microarray with the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray. the sensitivity of each microarray differed according to the nature of the probes  as shown by comparative studies  <cit> . seventy-mer oligonucleotides give better results in terms of specificity and sensitivity compared to cdna microarrays and this could explain some discrepancies observed between both microarrays in particular for the tap <dig> gene  <cit>  as confirmed in our study. with this integrated approach, a parallel increase in the number of differentially expressed prv and cellular genes was detected illustrating the viral and cellular transcript modifications during infection.

a picture of prv gene transcription during pk <dig> cell line infection
in our experimental conditions, we obtain a picture of the global prv gene transcription during the lytic cycle. prv transcription was monitored in single cycle conditions using a high moi that guarantees that more that 90% cells are infected. despite the presence of nested transcription units in prv preventing the design of probes specific of unique transcripts for some genes, we were, however, able to confidently report viral gene expression for probes specific of unique viral transcripts and draw a general picture of prv transcription during the time course of infection. as expected, the expression of most viral genes increased during infection. our results show that a notable increase in transcript levels and in the number of differentially expressed viral probes, detected from  <dig> h pi, correlates with viral growth and thus coincides with the beginning of the release of extracellular progeny . it has already been reported that the beginning of viral progeny usually occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi but without any description of the global viral transcription  <cit> . we observe a continuous increase in transcript levels and in the number of differentially expressed viral probes between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi followed by a stabilization when virion production is maximum. this suggests that the transcriptional machinery is fully active at  <dig> h pi thus permitting a massive virion production. all the different classes of viral transcripts are represented from  <dig> h pi . the molecular hallmark of herpesvirus infection is a temporally ordered gene transcription. as for other herpesviruses, the prv genes are subdivided in three main classes of successively expressed transcripts: immediate early, early and late transcripts  <cit> . after binding of the viral particle and fusion of the virion envelope with the cell membrane, the release of capsid and tegument proteins into the cell and the takeover of host cell protein synthesis machinery, the ie <dig> protein encoded by the immediate early gene is expressed in the cytoplasm and translocated to the nucleus. this protein can further transactivate the rna polymerase ii mediated transcription of early genes including transactivators of transcription  and proteins essential for viral replication   <cit> . the expression of ie <dig> has been reported to begin between  <dig> min and  <dig> h pi and last until  <dig> h pi  <cit> . in our experiment, the ie <dig> probe  was differentially expressed only at  <dig> h pi, when the transcript level probably reaches its peak value. this suggests that a low level of ie <dig> transcripts is sufficient to induce the transcription of early genes. in this experiment, the differential expression of us <dig> and ul <dig> was detected as early as  <dig> h pi but other early genes appeared differentially expressed later. interestingly, the ul <dig>  probe corresponding to the gn protein, responsible for tap inhibition, was differentially expressed at  <dig> h pi, even if this gene is not described as an early gene. the synthesis of late proteins, such as capsid , tegument  and envelope proteins  are reported to occur during the prv replication cycle  <cit> . in our study, the two late transcripts ul <dig> and ul <dig> encoding the gh protein were differentially expressed as early as  <dig> h pi. the four latest differentially expressed genes mostly encoded envelope or tegument proteins, except ul <dig> 

we described for the first time a global analysis of prv gene transcription using a microarray. the results of our analysis is consistent with what is known about prv viral cycle and with the kinetic classification of individual transcripts  <cit> . similar approaches have been developed for other alphaherpesviruses such as hsv- <dig>  <cit>  and varicella-zoster virus   <cit> . it is difficult to compare our results with those obtained in the vzv study because this viral system does not allow cell infection under single cycle synchronized conditions , which is required to establish reliable kinetics of viral gene expression. however our results are consistent with the transcriptomic study reported for hsv- <dig>  <cit> . it is clear from figure  <dig> that prv early homologues of hsv- <dig> immediate early genes  and early genes  are expressed at early times before most of the late genes encoding structural proteins. a clear distinction between immediate early, early and late genes for prv will require transcriptomic analysis in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide  or the viral dna replication inhibitor phosphonoacetic acid  as was done for hsv- <dig>  <cit> .

prv and cellular shutoff
a cellular shutoff during infection has been described for herpesviruses including prv  <cit> . in our experiment, a shutoff of pk <dig> genes is observed during infection since many cellular genes are down-regulated between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi. in contrast, at the  <dig> h time point,  <dig>  % of the viral genes are up-regulated. our transcriptomic analyses reveal that the shutoff occurs in porcine cells earlier than that previously reported in other transcriptome studies i.e. between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi in rat embryonic fibroblasts and from  <dig> h pi in human embryonic kidney cells  <cit> . it is assumed that the virion host shutoff protein  causes cellular shutoff. the vhs protein is an rnase located in the viral tegument, which degrades host and viral rna just after infection for hsv- <dig>  <cit> . unlike hsv- <dig>  it has been suggested that for cellular shutoff, prv requires a fresh round of viral protein synthesis explaining the observed delayed shutoff  <cit> . in our experiment, ul <dig> transcripts appear to be differentially expressed only at  <dig> h pi suggesting that the vhs activity can be attributed to the newly synthesized proteins and not to the vhs proteins present in the virion tegument at the moment of infection and that the vhs protein should be active at low level. the activity of hsv- <dig> vhs is modulated by the ul <dig> product , which can bind to vhs to allow viral mrna accumulation  <cit> . however, our study does not show any differential expression of the ul <dig> transcript.

prv infection and immune evasion strategies
to evade host response prv develops several strategies that probably disturb different biological pathways including the mhc class i presentation pathway. we observed a decrease of sla-ia and tap <dig> transcript levels in pk <dig> cells infected with the prv nia <dig> strain as previously reported in infected pk <dig> and bovine kidney cells respectively   <cit> . a down-regulation of tap <dig> and tap <dig> genes encoding immunoproteasome catalytic subunits, psmb <dig> and psmb <dig>  involved in the mhc class i antigenic presentation pathway was also detected in our experiment. moreover, we checked that at  <dig> h pi the pk <dig> cells expressed 50% less mhc class i proteins than mock-infected cells in our culture conditions. these results confirm previous reports describing the reduced capacity of infected cells to present viral peptides to ctl  <cit> . the viral gene ul <dig> , encoding the gn protein, is one of the earliest differentially expressed genes in our study . this viral protein has been shown to inhibit tap activity and induce degradation of tap molecules by the proteasome  <cit> . our results strongly suggest a very early production of gn protein and agree with the detection of tap inhibition from  <dig> h pi  <cit> . this tap inhibition has been shown to be independent of vhs activity  <cit>  and we demonstrate here that ul <dig> encoding vhs is differentially expressed later than ul <dig> , indicating two successive steps i.e. tap inhibition followed by cellular shutoff. since the level of several transcripts involved in the mhc class i presentation pathway  decreased, it is possible that prv has developed complementary strategies to evade this pathway i.e. turning off the peptide pump with inhibition of tap activity and transcription alteration of key players  <cit> . other viruses, such as the human cytomegalovirus, down-regulate the transcription of key players of the mhc class i antigen presentation pathway  <cit> . unexpectedly, some mhc class ii genes were also regulated during prv infection in pk <dig> cells. in particular, a down-regulation of class ii-like chaperones sla-dob and sla-dmb was observed. mhc class ii molecules that are constitutively expressed on professional antigen presenting cells , present peptides derived from exogenous antigens to cd4+ t-helper cells playing an important role in the induction and maintenance of ctl immunity. epithelial cells can also constitutively express mhc ii molecules but at a lower level than professional apcs  <cit> . in our experiment, we detected a small subpopulation of uninfected pk <dig> cells constitutively expressing mhc class ii molecules. however, we did not detect modifications of the mhc class ii expression at the cell surface. since a down-regulation of constitutive and ifnÎ³ induced hla class ii expression has been observed in cells infected by other herpesviruses  <cit> , our preliminary data suggest that it would be highly relevant to explore how prv may interfere with the mhc class ii presentation pathway in professional apcs.

in addition to genes belonging to mhc antigen presentation pathways, several other genes, playing a role in anti-viral response are regulated during prv infection such as genes belonging to the ifn signaling pathway. indeed, it has been reported that in primary rat fibroblasts, prv infection could suppress the establishment of the ifnÎ²-induced viral state  <cit> . irf <dig>  which is a transcriptional factor involved in ifnÎ² production by epithelial cells, is down-regulated together with a set of other irf. constitutively expressed in the cytosol, irf <dig> is phosphorylated during herpesvirus infection and translocated into the nucleus to target the ifnÎ² promoter. many viruses interfere with irf activities  <cit> . a decrease of irf <dig> mrna and protein levels has also been detected in cells infected with hepatitis c virus, resulting in the transcriptional repression of several ifn-stimulated genes  <cit> . in addition, tnf-alpha, which is a multifunctional cytokine with potent antiviral activities and which mediates protection against hsv- <dig> in the mouse  <cit>  was analyzed by qrt-pcr. a strong up-regulation of tnf was detected from the beginning of prv infection and until  <dig> h pi. these results suggest that the tnf transcription increase that is usually expected during an infection is not suppressed by prv infection and that the cellular shutoff does not target tnf.

other cellular pathways modulated during prv infection
our transcriptome analysis confirms that many other biological processes and functions are modulated during prv infection in porcine pk <dig> cells as previously observed in rat embryonic fibroblast and human embryonic kidney cells  <cit> . we have focused our study on a limited number of pathways and genes. interestingly, we observe both by transcriptome analysis and qrt-pcr that ppia gene expression is clearly down-regulated during prv infection. ppia encodes cyclophilin a, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which catalyzes the isomerization of peptide bonds from the trans to cis form at proline residues and facilitates protein folding  <cit>  and which acts as a cytosolic molecular chaperone. cyclophilins have been discovered because of their high affinity for cyclosporine, an immuno-suppressive drug, which prevents allograft rejection. this immunosuppressive effect is due to the calcineurin inhibition by a cyclosporin-cyclophilin complex. calcineurin is required for transcriptional activation of many cytokines in stimulated t cells. cyclophilin a can also interact with hiv- <dig> gag polyprotein and is involved in hiv- <dig> replication kinetics and modifies the infectivity of hiv- <dig> virions in jurkat t cells  <cit> . indeed, virions produced by ppia-/- cells are less infectious than virions produced by ppia+/+ cells. since we observed a down-regulation of ppia before the global cellular shutoff, cyclophilin a may be a target for prv and play a role in infection via an unknown mechanism.

several cellular genes involved in apoptosis were regulated during prv infection such as bcl- <dig> molecules and caspases. viral infection of mammalian cells tends to generate proapoptotic signals to limit viral replication but viruses and, in particular, herpesviruses produce molecules acting as modulators of apoptosis  <cit> . thus, us <dig> products from prv play an anti-apoptotic role  <cit> . the piknia <dig> probe specific to us <dig> long and short isoform transcripts was up-regulated from  <dig> h pi in our experiment, suggesting a possible late antiapoptotic role of the us <dig> products. in addition, prv genes homologous to other hsv- <dig> antiapoptotic genes may also possess an antiapoptotic role such as ul <dig> or us <dig>  <cit> . ul <dig> was not differentially expressed in our experiment in contrast to us <dig>  which was up-regulated very early as soon as  <dig> h pi.

genes belonging to nucleic acid metabolism were differentially expressed from very early time points. a repression of many genes encoding histones and nucleosome components occurred in pk <dig> cells during infection. these results are concordant with a former study, which has shown a gradual inhibition of histone synthesis in rk <dig> rabbit cells during prv infection  <cit> . we also observed a modulation of many histone deacetylases . acetylation of newly synthesized histones is required for their assembly into nucleosomes by histone chaperones and regulates the formation of heterochromatin that is critical for cellular gene transcription. us <dig>  which was up-regulated from  <dig> h pi in our experiment, can suppress histone acetylation during hsv <dig> infection  <cit> . indeed, prv us <dig> could also inhibit histone acetylation during infection.

prv infection regulates the expression of several genes involved in actin cytoskeleton signaling. a probe specific to actg <dig> was strongly up-regulated as soon as  <dig> h pi and reached a peak at  <dig> h pi. cytoskeleton actin is involved in prv assembly and in virus movement within the host cell. in particular, viral capsids can travel along nuclear actin filaments using myosin-directed transport in neurons but also in pk <dig> cells  <cit> . moreover, actins present in the nucleus participate in transcription  <cit> . among prv proteins, the us <dig> protein kinase contributes to cellular cytoskeleton modifications via the formation of actin- and microtubule-containing cell projections, a phenomenon associated with an increase of prv intercellular spread  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the originality of our approach lies in the simultaneous investigation of transcript levels of both host and pathogen genomes using a partial generic microarray and a dedicated microarray  combining all the prv genes and probes from the sla complex. it is now necessary to extend our analysis of the interactions between prv and porcine cells to other target cells, such as immature dendritic cells  that are the first immune cells interacting with the virus. this kind of approach should also be efficient  to study viral and cellular gene expression using mutant viruses in order to better understand the role of each viral gene and  to help identify species or strain specific transcriptomic signatures in host cells.
