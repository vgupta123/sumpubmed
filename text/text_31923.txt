BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous gene regulators distributed widely in plant genomes, and they play important roles in plant growth, development, signal transduction and response to environmental stimuli  <cit> . identification of mirnas is a key step in gaining insight into srna-based regulatory functions with many conserved mirnas having been identified by traditional sequencing approaches such as the sanger sequencing method  <cit> . however, most species-specific or tissue-specific mirnas are hard to be detected probably because of their low accumulation and/or insufficient stringency of the sequencing approach  <cit> . the advent of new sequencing technologies could make it possible to mine even species-/tissue- specific mirnas with low abundance, and they havebeen successfully used on arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, poplus tricocarpa, medicago tuncatula, gossypiumhirsutum, zea mays, arachis hypogaea l., solanumlycopersicum, citrus trifoliate, vitis vinifera and vitis amurensis rupr.  <cit> .

grapevine  is one of the most economically important fruit crops worldwide and has nutritional and processing properties  <cit> . in recent years, sequencing of small rna libraries from different grapevine cultivars or tissues has severally been reported where a large number of vvi-mirnas were identified  <cit> . despite this, there are no reports on the study of response of vvi-mirnas to phytohormones. phytohormones are important endogenous signals and regulators involved in plant growth and development  <cit> , and they are classified into auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene. all of these phytohormones act at low concentrations to regulate different aspects of plant growth and development to varying degrees  <cit> . among the hormones, ga <dig> play significant regulatoryroles in early berry expansion, berry set and berry ripening  <cit> . till now, it is still unclear on how ga <dig> participates in the regulation of the complicated developmental processes of grapevine berry.

it has been reported that phytohormone signaling pathways can be effectively controlled by modulation of positive and negative regulators during plant growth and development  <cit> . among the modulators of phytohormones, mirna was recently found to be a new growth regulator involved in phytohormone signaling  <cit> , with several studies showing the interactions between mirnas and phytohormones in various plant responses. for instance, ga <dig> modulates the expression of mir <dig>  while mir <dig> regulates the development of arabidopsis anthers and seeds by cleaving the gamyb gene, during arabidopsis anther development  <cit>  and seed germination  <cit> . in strawberry, mir <dig> interacts with gamyb during the course of receptacle development, and both of them act in a joint fashion to respond, in part, to changes in endogenous ga <dig> levels  <cit> . these studies strongly demonstrated that mirnas are involved in the ga <dig> signaling process.

to account for the roles of mirnas in response to ga <dig> during grapevine berry development, we constructed two small rna libraries from mixed tissue samples of grapevine berries sprayed with ga <dig>  and with water . the grapevine cultivar used for this study is ‘summer black’ , an elite table grapevine cultivar native to japan. after high-throughput sequencing, we identified a number of conserved and non-conserved vvi-mirnas responsive to ga <dig>  and we further analyzed their potential role in mediation of ga3-induced regulation of grapevine berry growth and development. further, qrt-pcr was utilized to analyze the expression of vvi-mirnas in different development stages of the grapevine berries subjected to exogenous ga <dig> and in exogenous ga3-free berries. lastly, an attempt to elucidate the regulatory functions of vvi-mirnas being responsive to ga <dig> during grapevine berry development was done.

RESULTS
characterization of the vvi-mirnas from deep sequencing of grapevine srna libraries
to identify ga3-responsive mirnas in grapevine berries, two small rna libraries from grapevine berries treated with ga <dig>  and sprayed with water  were constructed. solexa, a high throughput sequencing technology, was employed to sequence these libraries, leading to a generation of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads from ga <dig> treatment and the control libraries, respectively. all these clean reads were those from removal of adaptor, insert, polya, and rnas shorter than 18nt in length . about  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clear reads could be mapped to the grapevine genome published in  <dig>  <cit> , and mirna, trna, sirna, snrna, snorna, rrna, repeat regions, exon and intron rna reads were annotated. in addition,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> un-annotated reads were used for prediction of new vvi-mirnas in ga <dig> treatment and the control grapevine berries, respectively .

the size distribution of all srnas was found to be uneven ranging from 18nt to 30nt long, with the majority being 19-25nt long . the srnas of  <dig> nt and 24nt formed two major classes, occupying  <dig> % and  <dig> %  of the total, respectively, an observation which is in agreement with some previous reports in grapevine and tomato  <cit> , but contrasts to those reported in arabidopsis, rice and peanut  <cit> . the two main peaks of srnas in this study were  <dig> and 21nt long, while the most common srnas in taxus chinensis <cit>  and citrus trifoliate <cit>  were those with  <dig> nt in length. these cases suggested that some differences might exist in the srna biogenesis pathways in various plants. in addition, analysis of the first nucleotide of 18-25nt long srnas indicated that many srnas started with a uridine  at their 5’-ends and most of them are  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt long, with the former being most outstanding in number . similar to other plants, most mirnas here were those with  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length and they also begin with a 5’uridine, which is one of the important characteristic features of mirnas  <cit> .

high throughput sequencing can verify a large number of known mirnas together with the identification of novel specific mirnas even with the low abundance in organisms. from two srna libraries in this study, we first searched for known vvi-mirnas by comparing our libraries with known mirnas from other plant species in mirbase  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> known vvi-mirnas were sequenced both in the control and ga3-treatment libraries, and they belonged to  <dig> conserved mirna families according to a comparative genomics-based analysis in different plant species  <cit> . eighteen of the  <dig> vvi-mirna families contained many members , with four families  possessing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> members, respectively. another nine vvi-mirna families  had only one member each. among the known vvi-mirnas, the vvi-mir <dig> family had the most abundant reads accounting for  <dig> % of all the conserved mirna reads. in this family, the number of vvi-mir166h reads was over  <dig>  in the two libraries, followed by vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig> families, whose redundancies were more than several ten thousands. however, other mirna families like vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig> and vvi-mir <dig> had only a few or tens of reads. interestingly, the number and abundance of members of different vvi-mirna families between control and ga <dig> libraries were significant divergence , which in turn could reflect the discrepancy in their potential functions during the development of grapevine berries responsive to gibberellin.

bioinformatics analysis of the sequencing data could identify novel vvi-mirnas based on the criteria of novel mirna annotations developed by meyers et al.   <cit> . the genomic sequences with flanking un-announced sequences were extracted. among these sequences,  <dig> candidate vvi-mirnas were firstly uncovered, and the hairpin structures of their precursors’ could be predicted . the mirna* sequences available is of vital evidence supporting the release of mirna duplex from the predicted foldback structure  <cit> . among these  <dig> potential novel vvi-mirnas,  <dig> had their vvi-mirna* sequences were detected , and the sequences of  <dig> novel potential vvi-mirnas started with a 5’ uridine, the important feature of mirnas . all these confirmed the existence of these novel candidate vvi-mirnas in grapevine. in this study, it was also noted that the novel vvi-mirnas had fewer reads than the conserved ones. 72% of the former had only several or dozens of copies except for vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  and vvi-mirc <dig> that were sequenced more than one thousand times . this agreed with other previously reported results  <cit> , where most novel species-specific mirnas were usually expressed at lower levels than their conserved counterparts and were much more spatiotemporally expressed.

discovery of mirnas responsive to exogenous ga <dig> in grapevine
to identify vvi-mirnas responsive to exogenous ga <dig>  we normalized the counts of reads sequenced based on the systematical analysis, and compared the members and the normalized counts  of different members of vvi-mirna families between the control and ga <dig> libraries. the results revealed that seven known vvi-mirnas  were found only in the ga <dig> treated grapevine tissues not in the control, suggesting they were probably those induced by ga3; another  <dig> known vvi-mirnas  were strongly repressed in ga <dig> treatment for they could only be detected in the control but not in the ga <dig> treatment .

thirty novel vvi-mirnas  were found to be responsive to exogenous ga <dig>  for they could only be detected in ga <dig> treated grapevines ; while another  <dig> novel vvi-mirnas  were repressed by exogenous ga <dig>  and found only in control but not in ga <dig> treatment . these results demonstrate that these groups of vvi-mirnas could be responsive to ga <dig> treatment.

further comparison of the normalized counts of vvi-mirnas identified in ga <dig> treated and the control plants indicated that many vvi-mirnas exhibited drastic variations  in expression frequencies. as shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the expression of  <dig> vvi-mirnas was strongly responsive to exogenous ga <dig>  with  <dig> of them induced by ga <dig>  showing conspicuously up-regulated expression under ga <dig> treatment .conversely,  <dig> vvi-mirnas were repressed by exogenous ga <dig> , leading to drastic reduction in their expression levels in ga3-treated grapevines. an interesting revelation was that diverse members of the same vvi-mirna family could exhibit conspicuous discrepancy in their responses to exogenous ga <dig>  this aspect is best exemplified by vvi-mir <dig> family, where vvi-mir166d/e/f/g had more than  <dig>  reads in control samples, but possessed only several dozen or even a little more reads in the ga <dig> treatment samples, while vvi-mir166b was detected  <dig>  times in control and  <dig>  times in ga <dig> treatment . vvi-mir166h, however, had no distinct variations between the control and ga <dig> treatment . similar situations were found in other vvi-mirna families like vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig> and vvi-mir <dig> , suggesting the vvi-mirnas responsive to exogenous ga <dig> application possess multiple aspects and functions during the development of grapevine berries.

expression patterns of vvi-mirnas responsive to exogenous ga <dig> during grapevine berry development
spatiotemporal expression of grapevine mirnas could not only provide clues to their physiological functions, but also give fundamental evidence supporting the existence of the mirnas in grapevine. in this study,  <dig> vvi-mirnas  detected in grapevine berries treated with ga <dig> were subjected to qrt-pcr expression analysis as described in section  <dig>  this could also be applied to the analysis of the degree of response of these vvi-mirnas to ga <dig> treatments. we screened for the expression profiles of mirnas responsive to ga <dig> treatments in the diverse stages of grapevine berries by qrt-pcr. the results showed that the expression levels of  <dig> vvi-mirnas  were up-regulated by ga <dig>  while  <dig>  were down-regulated by ga <dig>  and seven  were un-affected by ga <dig> .

further analysis of the expression results of  <dig> known vvi-mirnas responsive to ga <dig> both from qrt-pcr and high throughput sequencing revealed that the qrt-pcr expressions of  <dig> were consistent with the results from high throughput sequencing, which could not only demonstrated the reliability of these two technologies, but confirm the characteristics of these known ga <dig> responsive vvi-mirnas. on the other hand, it was discernible that the expression analysis results of  <dig> novel ga <dig> responsive vvi-mirnas from both qrt-pcr and high throughput sequencing were not of the same phenomenon, for only three  was in the same way. this discrepancy in behavior of conserved and novel vvi-mirnas requires further research; while the consistency of the expression results, for the most conserved and a few novel vvi-mirnas, from the assays of the qrt-pcr and high throughput may provide some evidence supporting the fact about these vvi-mirnas responsive to ga <dig> 

characterization of potential target genes for novel vvi-mirnas responsive to ga3
to further comprehend the functions of these newly identified species-specific vvi-mirnas, it was essential to search for their target genes. following the rules suggested by schwab et al.   <cit> , we searched the grapevine transcript database , and predicted a total of  <dig> putative target genes for  <dig> novel vvi-mirnas . among the  <dig> novel vvi-mirnas,  <dig> had multiple target genes, as exemplified by vvi-mirc <dig> with  <dig> target genes, indicating these vvi-mirnas might possess comprehensive functions in grapevine. based on orthologous functional annotation in other plants, these target genes seemed to be functionally involved in glucose metabolism , aromatic substance biosynthesis in berry , signal transduction , stress resistance , etc. . we also noted that there were a large number of potential target genes with unknown functions for novel vvi-mirnas, especially those responsive to ga <dig> . more in depth investigation on their functions would be essential for thorough understanding of the mechanisms of grapevine flower and fruit development and of the formation of berry quality.

verification of potential vvi-mirna target genes using 5’-rlm-race
to verify the nature of potential mirna targets and to study the vvi-mirnas’ regulation on their target genes, a modified rlm-race experiment was set up and used to map the cleavage sites in four predicted vvi-mirna target genes. results showed that the cleavage sites of these four mirna target genes gsvivt <dig>  gsvivt <dig>  gsvivt <dig> and gsvivt <dig> for vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig>  vvi-mirc <dig> and vvi-mirc <dig> in this study is at the nucleotide that pairs with the 9th and/or 10th and/or 11th nucleotide of the corresponding mirnas , consistent with previous related reports  <cit> . the gsvivt <dig>  gsvivt <dig>  gsvivt <dig> and gsvivt <dig> were confirmed as the true targets of vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig>  vvi-mir <dig> andvvi-mir <dig>  respectively. functional analysis indicated that gsvivt <dig>  gsvivt <dig>  gsvivt <dig> and gsvivt <dig> could be of cc-nbs-lrr resistance protein, nbs-lrrresistance protein, leucine-rich repeat family protein, and lipoxygenase .

discussion
to verify the hypothesis that mirnas play some role inregulating plant response to ga <dig> <cit> , two small rna libraries from grapevine berries treated with ga <dig> and without ga <dig> were constructed and used for high-throughput sequencing of srnas, from which a total of  <dig> vvi-mirnas , with  <dig> of them being firstly found to be responsive to ga <dig> in grapevine. further comparison of our dataset from this work to vvi-mirnas reported earlier by us  <cit>  revealed that since the grapevine materials used in these studies was the same grapevine cultivar, most of the vvi-mirnas could be observed in these two studies, while only a few members  could be discovered in one of both studies, which may be derived from the differences in the development stages of grapevine materials used in these studies or ga <dig> induced/depressed vvi-mirnas in this work.

the breakthroughs in sequencing technology have provided the most powerful tool for mirna discovery, and one of the advantages of the thorough approach is its ability to reveal novel mirnas. in this work, a large number of novel candidate vvi-mirnas were uncovered, with the mirnas* for some novel vvi-mirnas being detected too. the identification of mirnas*of the candidate mirnas provides convincing evidence for consideration of these vvi-mirnas as authentic  <cit> . importantly, the expression levels of some novel vvi-mirnas and their mirnas* under ga <dig> treatments had much more diverse variation compared to the control. the best examples of this phenomenon are vvi-mirc20/vvi-mirc20*, vvi-mirc34/vvi-mirc34*, vvi-mirc52/vvi-mir c52* and vvi-mirc53/vvi-mirc53* . the expressions of vvi-mirc <dig> and vvi-mirc <dig> were up-regulated in ga <dig> treatments compared to the control, while the expression of their mirnas* was down-regulated. on the contrary, the expressions of vvi-mirc <dig> and vvi-mirc <dig> were down-regulated in ga <dig> treatments, while those of their mirnas* were up-regulated . the reasons for these discrepancies have not been clearly elucidated. the drastic variation in expression levels of the vvi-mirna* under ga <dig> treatments could indicate these mirnas* were important regulatory genes like vvi-mirnas  <cit> .

from high throughput sequencing and qrt-pcr analysis, it was further revealed that the conserve vvi-mirnas responsive to ga <dig> had the higher consistency between these two assays, while the novel ones showed some distinct discrepancy. this might be derived from the fact that the conserved vvi-mirnas possessed the higher conservation of development and function, while the novel ones had high specificity. other, the samples used in the high throughput sequencing were the mixed materials from grapevine berries of several development stages, while those used for the qrt-pcr were of three stages berries ,  <dig> waf,  <dig> waf). these could be the reasons explaining the expression levels of novel vvi-mirnas from qrt-pcr and high throughput sequencing had more apparent differences than those of conserved vvi-mirnas. in addition, the predication of potential target genes for novel vvi-mirnas responsive to exogenous ga <dig> and functional annotations of their orthologous target genes in other plants revealed that  <dig> genes were related to stress resistance. whether or how these ga <dig> responsive novel vvi-mirnas are involved in the regulation of stress resistance can call for further research. the functions of one-third of the novel vvi-mirnas were unknown, indicating that more studies need to be performed on these novel mirnas to elucidate their functions in the growth of grapevine.

CONCLUSIONS
deep sequencing of short rnas from grapevine berries in ga <dig> treatment and the control identified  <dig> ga3-responsive mirnas, of which  <dig> exhibited different expression profiles of response to ga <dig> in the diverse developmental stages of grapevine berries. these vvi-mirnas identified might be involved in the grapevine berry development and response to various environments.
