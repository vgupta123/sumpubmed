BACKGROUND
heparan sulfate proteoglycans  abundantly exist in the ecm and on the cell surface of most cells  <cit> . they are composed of a restricted set of core proteins to which one or more glycosaminoglycan chains  are covalently attached. it is established that hspgs are involved in a wide range of biological functions through their ability to bind to and modify the activities of a diverse repertoire of ligands including growth factors, morphogens, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, lipases, matrix proteins, and cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . heparan sulfate  chains and heparins  consist of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic/iduronic acid and glucosamine that are subject to a complex set of modifications involving deacetylation, epimerization, and sulfation. four different sites of sulfation are found in heparin/hs: the n-, 3-o, and 6-o positions of glucosamine and the 2-o position of the iduronic acid residue. heparin is highly-sulfated throughout the polymer chain whereas in hs these modifications are concentrated mainly in the s-domains, which consist of contiguous clusters of n-sulfated disaccharide units variably sulfated at the other positions  <cit> . interspersed with the s domains are regions with low  or zero sulfation; however, the transition zones contain a considerable fraction of the 6-o-sulfates in hs  <cit> . the ligand binding activities of hspg/heparin depend on patterns of sulfation along the chains  <cit> .

hs chains are dynamically regulated in development and during tumor progression  <cit> . since these changes are central to the ligand binding properties of hspgs, there is considerable interest in mechanisms that generate diversity of the chains. one such mechanism is through regulated expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, for example, the sulfotransferases that modify hs chains  <cit> . another potential mechanism is through the action of extracellular endosulfatases that remove specific sulfation modifications from intact gag chains. the first enzyme identified in this category was qsulf- <dig>  which was discovered in quail embryo  <cit> . stimulated by this work, we cloned cdnas encoding sulf- <dig> and a new member of the family, sulf- <dig>  in mouse and human  <cit> . we showed that both sulf- <dig> and sulf- <dig> are secreted into conditioned medium when they are expressed in chinese hamster ovary  cells. both possess endoglucosamine-6-sulfatase activity against intact heparin with an optimum at neutral ph. the enzymes liberate sulfate groups from the c- <dig> position of glucosamine residues on trisulfated -idoa-glcnso3- disaccharide units of heparin. a similar activity for qsulf- <dig> has now been confirmed on hs chains  <cit> . this trisulfated disaccharide structure occurs within the s-domains and is known to be a key element in many of the protein ligand interactions of heparin and hs .

the transcripts corresponding to qsulf- <dig> and its rat orthologue  demonstrate complex spatiotemporal regulation during embryonic development  <cit>  and qsulf- <dig> plays an essential role in wnt-dependent differentiation of somites into muscle in quail  <cit> . in addition, in vitro assays have demonstrated that qsulf- <dig> promotes both wnt  <cit>  and bone morphogenetic protein  <cit>  signaling via its sulfatase activity. less is known about the distribution and function of the sulfs in adult tissues. however, some interesting correlations have been revealed in tumors. lai and colleagues have reported downregulation of sulf- <dig> transcripts in human ovarian cancer and a subset of hepatocellular carcinomas  <cit> . these workers and others have stressed the potential role of the enzyme in down-modulating certain signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, since over-expression of sulf- <dig> reduces signaling by fgf- <dig>  hb-egf, or hgf  <cit> . in striking contrast to the results in ovarian cancer, increased levels of sulf <dig> or sulf <dig> transcripts are observed in other human cancers including breast and pancreatic carcinomas  <cit> . upregulation of sulf- <dig> at both the transcript and protein levels has been established in two mouse models of mammary carcinoma  <cit> . furthermore, cultured human breast carcinoma cells release enzymatically active sulf- <dig> into conditioned medium. the upregulation of sulf- <dig> raises the possibility that it may be involved in promoting tumor progression  <cit> . indeed, we have shown that sulf- <dig> has pro-angiogenic activity, a relevant function for contributing to tumorigenesis  <cit> .

even before the discovery of the sulfs, the glucosamine-6-sulfate modification of hs was the focus of considerable interest. thus, it has been shown that suppressing the expression of heparan sulfate 6-o-sulfotransferases via gene silencing strategies has pronounced developmental consequences in both drosophila and zebrafish development  <cit> . secondly, binding studies with heparin/hs fragments and chemically modified heparins point to an essential contribution of the glucosamine-6-sulfate modification to their interaction with various protein ligands, including fgf- <dig>  <cit> , fgf- <dig>  <cit> , pdgf  <cit> , vefg  <cit> , hepatocyte growth factor  <cit> , lipoprotein lipase  <cit> , herpes simplex glycoprotein c  <cit> , noggin  <cit> , and l- and p-selectin  <cit> . here, we have taken advantage of recombinant sulf- <dig> generated in  <dig> cells and of native sulf- <dig> obtained from conditioned medium of a breast carcinoma cell line to explore the range of activities for this enzyme. we have established an elisa to examine the effects of sulf- <dig> from these two sources on the interaction of several growth factors and chemokines with immobilized heparin/hs. we found that pre-treatment of heparin with sulf- <dig> significantly reduced its reactivity with certain ligands but not others  and the enzyme also dissociated heparin-ligand complexes  raising the possibility that it may be involved in mobilizing hs-bound ligands in the ecm and basement membranes.

RESULTS
effect of recombinant hsulf- <dig> on the binding of vegf <dig>  fgf- <dig> and fgf- <dig> to heparin
we wanted to know if sulf- <dig>  as a 6-o endosulfatase, could modulate the interaction of known heparin-binding growth factors to heparin. we prepared and purified amino-terminal flag-tagged hsulf- <dig>  from stably transfected kidney  <dig> cells . the major rhsulf- <dig> component detected by the h <dig>  antibody migrated with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda. immunoblotting of rhsulf- <dig> with a flag antibody revealed a protein band of the same molecular weight . we conclude that the  <dig> kda component represents an n-terminal subunit with a c-terminal truncation. it should be noted that there are several potential furin cleavage sites that are c-terminal to the position of the peptide immunogen   <cit> . it is not known at present whether protein processing is necessary for enzymatic activity against heparan sulfate substrates. we also prepared an enzymatically-inactive mutant of hsulf- <dig>  <cit>  in which two essential cysteines were mutated to alanines . as we had previously shown for cho cell-produced material  <cit> , rhsulf- <dig> exhibited endosulfatase activity against heparin in a concentration- and time- dependent manner . the assay employs hplc to examine to the disaccharide composition of treated and untreated heparin . after  <dig> h of enzyme treatment, 80% of the trisulfated disaccharides were converted to the disaccharide products. the mutant protein was inactive in this assay . we next developed solid phase elisas to measure the binding of protein ligands to immobilized heparin-bsa. antibodies directed to the ligands were used for detection. for "pre-binding" effects, we first treated heparin-bsa with rhsulf- <dig> and then tested for its ability to support ligand binding . for "post-binding" effects, we determined the ability of rhsulf- <dig> to release the ligand from a preformed complex with heparin-bsa .

we initially focused our attention on three growth factors: vegf <dig>  fgf- <dig> and fgf- <dig>  sulfate groups in heparin/hs, including glucosamine-6-sulfates, are required for the interaction of vegf <dig> and fgf- <dig> with heparin/hs  <cit> . in contrast, fgf- <dig> binding to heparin/hs depends on n-sulfation and iduronate-2-sulfation but not on 6-o-sulfation  <cit> . we observed saturable binding of vegf <dig>  fgf- <dig> and fgf- <dig> to heparin-bsa . we estimated kd's for these interactions and the binding of three chemokines  to heparin-bsa . negligible binding was seen when the wells were coated with bsa alone . as a positive control to eliminate heparin-dependent binding, we pre-digested heparin-bsa with a mixture of heparinases  for  <dig> h and found that this digestion reduced the binding of vegf by >92%. treatment of heparin with rhsulf- <dig> reduced the binding of varying concentrations of vegf to heparin-bsa almost to background levels . rhsulf- <dig> treatment diminished the binding of fgf- <dig> by >60%. in contrast, rhsulf- <dig> had only a negligible effect on the binding of fgf- <dig> to heparin . to determine the efficacy of the enzyme, we fixed the concentration of ligand at approximately its kd and tested varying concentrations of rhsulf- <dig> or the inactive mutant, rΔcchsulf- <dig>  for fgf- <dig>  only minimal effects of rhsulf- <dig> were seen up to  <dig> ng of the enzyme, whether tested in the pre-binding  or post-binding assay . in contrast, treatment of heparin-bsa with  <dig> ng or more of rhsulf- <dig> substantially reduced its binding to vegf in a dose-dependent manner , whereas the mutant enzyme was largely inactive. in the post-binding assay, rhsulf- <dig> was also efficacious in releasing vegf from preformed complexes with heparin-bsa . the slight inhibitory effects of rΔcchsulf- <dig>  in both the pre-binding and post-binding assays may be attributable to a competing heparin-binding activity of sulf- <dig> protein due to its highly basic hydrophilic domain  <cit> .

each kd value was estimated from the concentration of ligand needed for half-maximal saturation. in the cases of il- <dig> binding to heparin-bsa and vegf binding to hs-bsa, saturation was not observed at the highest concentration tested.

n.d., not determined.

a kd for heparin-bsa was  <dig> nm. the fixed concentration of ligand tested in the assay was  <dig> nm.

effects of hsulf- <dig> on chemokine binding to heparin-bsa
chemokines are also heparin/hs-binding proteins  <cit> . however, limited information is available about the specific sulfation requirements for these interactions. we therefore took advantage of rhsulf- <dig> to determine the contributions of glucosamine-6-sulfation to these interactions. rhsulf- <dig> was very effective in reducing the interaction of sdf- <dig>  with heparin-bsa in both pre-binding and post-binding assays . in contrast, rhsulf- <dig> had only partial inhibitory effects on the binding of slc  to heparin-bsa . il- <dig>  bound less well to heparin-bsa, but rhsulf- <dig> treatment still attenuated the interaction .

analysis of the activity of native hsulf- <dig> in mcf- <dig> conditioned medium
sulf <dig> transcripts are upregulated in breast, central nervous system and colon carcinomas  <cit> . moreover, transcripts are detected in some cultured human breast carcinoma cell lines and the mrna-positive cells release sulf- <dig> protein in their conditioned medium  <cit> . sulf- <dig> expression is highest in the conditioned of mcf- <dig> cells and we have demonstrated that the secreted protein has associated arylsulfatase activity using 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate as the substrate  <cit> . as shown in fig. 4a, the cm from these cells exhibited concentration- and time-dependent endoglucosamine-6-sulfatase activity against heparin. in pilot experiments, the cm also showed activity against bovine intestinal heparan sulfate  producing a substantial reduction in the amount of the trisulfated disaccharide with a corresponding increase in the amount of the disulfated disaccharide product . using cm as a source of the native enzyme, we analyzed the "pre-binding" and "post-binding" effects on the binding of vegf or fgf- <dig> to heparin. consistent with the rhsulf- <dig> findings, pretreatment of heparin-bsa with a fixed concentration of mcf- <dig> cm strongly reduced the subsequent binding of vegf <dig> or fgf- <dig> but had no effect on the binding of fgf- <dig> . in a dose-dependent manner, cm prevented  and reversed  the interaction of vegf <dig> or fgf- <dig> with heparin-bsa. similar effects were observed with sdf- <dig> . in contrast, the same range of cm concentrations had no appreciable effect on the binding of fgf- <dig> to heparin-bsa in either the pre-binding or post-binding assays . to confirm that the reductions in heparin binding were, in fact, due to sulf- <dig>  we employed anti-hsulf- <dig> antibodies  <cit>  for immunodepletion of sulf- <dig> from mcf cm. pre-clearing was carried out by incubating cm with protein a-sepharose complexed to a mixture of two specific antibodies and then centrifuging the mixture. as shown by western blotting, the specific antibodies removed the majority of hsulf- <dig> protein from the cm, whereas control igg removed only a relatively small amount of the protein . in parallel with the depletion of hsulf- <dig> protein, the "pre-binding" activity of the precleared cm, measured with respect to vegf <dig> binding, was greatly diminished as compared to that of the control igg-treated cm .

effects of hsulf- <dig> on heparan sulfate interactions
heparin is a structural analogue of the s-domains of heparan sulfate. we wanted to determine whether the effects of sulf- <dig> on heparin interactions would be repeated with bona fide heparan sulfate. for this purpose, we conjugated bsa with heparan sulfate chains  that were isolated from porcine intestinal mucosa. fgf- <dig> bound to hs-bsa, although with a 3-fold lower affinity than to heparin-bsa . this binding was abolished by pre-digestion of the hs chains with heparinases. pretreatment of the hs-bsa with mcf- <dig> cm or rhsulf- <dig> substantially diminished fgf- <dig> binding , whereas rΔcchsulf- <dig> did not exert this effect .

discussion
the sulfs are 6-o endosulfatases that act on the trisulfated disaccharide unit -glcnso3-) which is the most common unit in heparin but is largely confined to the s-domains of hs  <cit> . as the heterogeneous pattern of sulfation within s domains is known to dictate the binding specificity of many proteins for heparin/hs  <cit> , the sulfs could potentially regulate those interactions with a dependence on the presence of trisulfated disaccharides within the binding motif. here, we have employed sulf- <dig> as a tool to explore the binding requirements of several proteins, some of which had been previously characterized and others whose binding requirements were largely unknown. previous work has shown that qsulf- <dig> treatment of soluble recombinant form of an hspg  reduced its ability to bind a wnt ligand  <cit> . also, the interaction of noggin with cell surface hspgs was diminished by the overexpression of qsulf- <dig> in the cells  <cit> . in the present study we have taken advantage of two sources of soluble hsulf-2: recombinant enzyme purified from stably transfected  <dig> cells and a natural form of the enzyme in cm of a human breast carcinoma cell line . it should be noted that we have not been able to obtain expression of high level of sulf- <dig> in cm of transfected  <dig> cells, nor have we yet identified a soluble form of this enzyme from a native source.

we have previously shown that native sulf- <dig> in mcf- <dig> cm has arylsulfatase activity  <cit> . in the present study, we have used hplc to demonstrate that mcf- <dig> cm possesses endosulfatase activity against intact heparin. this result has also been established by an alternative approach using mass spectroscopy  <cit> . employing an elisa based on binding of protein ligands to heparin-bsa conjugate, we found that rhsulf- <dig> strongly modulated the binding of vegf <dig>  fgf- <dig>  and sdf- <dig> to porcine intestinal heparin. in the case of fgf- <dig>  the inhibitory effect of sulf- <dig> was also demonstrated for heparan sulfate chains as well, using a hs-bsa conjugate. all of the effects obtained with the recombinant enzyme were observed for mcf- <dig> cm, and we confirmed that the activity in the cm was due to sulf- <dig>  the porcine intestinal heparin used in this study contained 70% trisulfated disaccharides, 18% disulfated disaccharides, 7% monosulfated disaccharides and 5% unsulfated disaccharides . based on our previous work  <cit>  and the present study, we estimate that about 80% of the total trisulfated disaccharides in heparin-bsa was converted into disulfated disaccharides by sulf- <dig>  thus, only about 22% of the overall sulfate moieties were removed by the enzyme treatment, arguing against the possibility that the reduced binding of selective protein ligands to treated heparin was due to a reduction in overall charge. as heparan sulfates have limited s-domains  <cit> , sulf- <dig> would be predicted to have an even smaller effect on the global sulfation of hspgs. a further indication of the selectivity of sulf- <dig> is that there is no relationship between the estimated kd for binding of each ligand to heparin-bsa  and the susceptibility of the interaction to the enzyme .

the sulf- <dig> effects on fgf- <dig> binding were anticipated based on a number of correlative studies  <cit> , which have implicated the trisulfated disaccharide motif as a binding element in hs chains. our vegf <dig> results are compatible with a previous study in which chemical 6-o-desulfation of heparin strongly weakened its ability to interact with vegf <dig>  <cit> . however, our findings provide the first direct evidence that 6-o-sulfation of heparin within the context of the trisulfated disaccharide motif is essential for the interaction. the majority of vegf isoforms are able to bind to heparin/hs  <cit> , and it is anticipated that our results will generalize to these other forms as well. with respect to sdf- <dig>  it has long been known that this highly basic chemokine binds relatively strongly to heparin  <cit> , but the fine specificity of the interaction has not previously been explored. slc and il- <dig> showed a partial sensitivity to the desulfation effects of sulf- <dig> on heparin. this partial susceptibility implies that the 6-o-sulfation of the trisulfated disaccharide can contribute but is not absolutely required for a measurable binding interaction with heparin. one important avenue for future investigation is based on our observation that sulf- <dig> strongly modulated the interactions of two chemokines  with heparin. sdf- <dig> has been implicated in a diverse range of processes such as lymphocyte chemotaxis, stem cell homing and retention, tissue repair, angiogenesis, and organ-specific metastasis  <cit> , whereas slc is important in lymphoid organ homeostasis and inflammation  <cit> . thus, sulf- <dig> though effects on the ecm-association of chemokines could have important roles in a number of normal and pathophysiologic processes. hsulf- <dig> with an apparently indistinguishable enzymatic activity  <cit>  may exert similar effects on hspg-bound growth factors and chemokines.

it is well established that one function of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the ecm and basement membranes is to sequester protein ligands away from signal transduction receptors  <cit> . a known mechanism to regulate the mobilization of such factors is through the action of heparanase, an endo-ß-d-glucuronidase that degrades heparan sulfate chains into relatively large fragments  <cit> . this enzyme is present in a number of normal cell types  and is upregulated in several cancers. expression of heparanase in a number of settings elicits angiogenesis, apparently through the release of hspg-bound angiogenic factors  <cit> . our finding that sulf- <dig> can reverse the association between heparin and angiogenic factors  suggests the possibility of functional parallels between these two enzymes. sulf- <dig> may mobilize vegf or other angiogenic factors sequestered in the ecm and increase their bioavailability to endothelial cells that express the appropriate signaling receptors. the ability of rhsulf- <dig> to promote angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane  assay is consistent with such a scenario  <cit> . thus, the observed upregulation of sulf- <dig> in mammary carcinomas and its secretion from these cells could directly contribute to tumor angiogenesis and thus tumor growth. sulf- <dig> derived from a cancer cell could also conceivably mobilize hspg-bound growth factors that then act back on the cancer cell and thus trigger its own proliferation. the ability of qsulf- <dig> to promote wnt signaling within the cells that express the enzyme provides a plausible paradigm for this type of autocrine pathway  <cit> . it should be borne in mind that in the context of some other signaling pathways , sulf- <dig> is likely to exert a negative effect.

CONCLUSIONS
as demonstrated in the present study, sulf- <dig> can modulate the interaction of a number of important bioactive proteins with heparin/hs. a major finding of our study is that sulf- <dig> completely disrupts the interaction of certain factors with heparin. as expected, the factors for which sulf- <dig> strongly blocks binding to heparin in the pre-binding format are the most susceptible to reversal effects in the post-binding assays . these observations indicate that, irrespective of the engagement of a protein ligand, sulf- <dig> has access to the 6-o-sulfate group of the trisulfated disaccharide units of intact heparin. recombinant sulf- <dig> provides a valuable tool for investigating the specific sulfation requirements for heparin/hs interactions of interest. furthermore, future application of the assays described herein will certainly expand the range of interactions that can be modulated by sulf- <dig> and should enhance our understanding of the potential functional roles served by this enzyme in situ.
