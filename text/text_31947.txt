BACKGROUND
the vertebrate retina is organized into a complex network of cell layers, namely the ganglion cell layer  which contains retinal ganglion cells  and displaced amacrine cells , the inner nuclear layer  which consists of acs, horizontal, bipolar and müller glia cells, and the outer nuclear layer  which is made up of cone and rod photoreceptors. this strikingly complex architectural plan of the retina is extremely well conserved across vertebrate species, probably in direct correlation with the conservation of the key regulatory factors that govern retinal development. several members of the basic helix-loop-helix  and homeodomain family of transcription factors are known to play a role in the determination of retinal progenitor competence and cell fate, a function that is highly conserved from fish to mammals  <cit> . much less is known on the contribution of different functional paralogs of retina-specific transcription factors, which arose subsequently to rounds of whole genome duplication  during vertebrate evolution  <cit> . indeed, it has been proposed that after wgd, duplicated genes can either accumulate loss-of-function mutations and are functionally lost  or acquire a new function , or split the ancestral function between the paralogs   <cit> ), therefore adding complexity to the developmental gene network that shapes organ formation. the genes of the barhl family encoding the homeobox transcription factors barhl <dig> and barhl <dig>  have been shown to be expressed in more or less overlapping domains of the central nervous system and have partially redundant functions in neural subtype cell identity, migration and survival  <cit> ; however, barhl <dig> members appear to be uniquely expressed in the retina  <cit> . in particular, barhl <dig> is a pan-vertebrate regulator of the specification and survival of acs and rgcs  <cit> . forced expression of barhl <dig> in the mouse retina promotes the differentiation of glycinergic amacrine cells at the expense of bipolar and müller cells  <cit> . additionally, analysis of barhl2-null retinas suggests that barhl <dig> plays a critical role in both ac subtype determination and in rgc survival  <cit> . the xenopus barhl <dig> ortholog  has been shown to be expressed in rgcs and in presumptive ac precursors, and to promote rgc differentiation downstream of the bhlh transcription factor atoh <dig>  <cit> . while xenopus, mouse, rat and human have one copy of barhl <dig> and barhl <dig> each, zebrafish has three barhl paralogs possibly due to a further genome duplication event that teleosts underwent during evolution after the split from the tetrapod lineage  <cit> . on the basis of protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, it has been suggested that two of these orthologs belong to the barhl <dig> paralog group  while the third belongs to the barhl <dig> group  <cit> . in contrast to mouse and xenopus, all three barhl seem to be expressed both in the brain and in the retina  <cit> . in medaka fish , only one barhl has been described so far ; based on phylogenetic analysis olbarhl has been clustered to the barhl <dig> group of paralogs  <cit> . to get more insights into the evolution of barhl paralogs with respect to retinal differentiation we took advantage of the zebrafish and medaka model systems to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of barhl gene expression as compared to the one in tetrapod. by detailed in situ hybridization analysis we confirmed that barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> are expressed in the zebrafish retina but not barhl <dig> . a meticulous inspection of barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> transcript distribution indicates that while barhl <dig> appears to recapitulate the expression of its mammalian and xenopus counterpart, the spatio-temporal expression pattern of barhl <dig>  is non redundant to that of barhl <dig>  suggesting that barhl <dig>  might have evolved non redundantly with respect to barhl <dig> in the retina. interestingly, we have detected that barhl <dig>  shows a very early onset of expression which is highly overlapping with the expression of the atoh <dig> gene demarcating the onset of rgc genesis. furthermore, we also describe a new barhl paralog in medaka which, based on protein alignment, could be assigned to the barhl <dig> group. by comparing the expression of medaka barhl <dig> and barhl <dig>  we found that they are both expressed in the retina, in a pattern reminiscent of zebrafish barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> respectively. these results combined with phylogenetic and synteny analysis suggest that barhl retinal expression domain is an ancestral feature that has been specifically lost in tetrapod probably due to functional redundancy following the duplication-supplementation paradigm  <cit> .

RESULTS
zebrafish barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig>  but not barhl <dig> , are expressed in distinct spatio-temporal domains of the developing retina
in light of the distinct expression of barhl <dig> and barhl <dig> in the tetrapod retina, we aimed at clarifying the retinal expression domains spanned by each of the three paralogs to get further insight into a possible non-redundant function of barhl paralogs in the zebrafish retina. we performed in situ hybridization on embryos at different developmental stages, starting from the beginning of retinal differentiation around  <dig> hours-post-fertilization , until  <dig> hpf. transcripts of barhl <dig> are detected in the retina as early as  <dig> hpf . at this stage, most rgcs and the first acs are born  <cit> . barhl <dig> transcripts are initially localized in a few cells in the central retina and subsequently expressed in the whole retina , in a pattern matching the wave of ac genesis. at  <dig> hpf, expression appears mostly restricted to the inner part of the inl  and later on it extends to the gcl . by  <dig> hpf expression is maintained in both the inl and the rgc layer . interestingly, transcripts of barhl <dig>  were detected in the retina already at 28- <dig> hpf . this stage corresponds to the peak of rgc genesis. similarly to barhl <dig>  its expression is initially restricted to the central retina and subsequently spreads temporally and dorsally . however, this expression appears largely restricted to the rgc layer  and it later becomes restricted to the ciliary marginal zone  . in contrast, no evident expression of barhl <dig>  was found in the retina at all stages analyzed, although transcripts could be clearly detected in the brain . this observation confirms that zebrafish barhl <dig>  is the ortholog of other vertebrate barhl1; which were never found expressed in the retina of tetrapod  <cit> .

expression of barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> in the retina suggests distinct regulation by atoh7
given the observed non-redundant expression of barhl <dig> and barhl <dig>  transcripts in the retina, we then investigated in greater detail the relative spatio-temporal distribution of these two transcripts by double fluorescent in situ hybridization . at  <dig> hpf, a few barhl2-fitc  positive cells could be detected in the central retina, located within a broader domain of barhl <dig> -cy <dig>  positive cells . within this domain, expression of barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> appears mostly non-overlapping . by  <dig> hpf, transcripts of barhl <dig>  are mostly restricted to the gcl while the ones of barhl <dig> are mostly found in the inner part of the inl where acs are present . interestingly, overlapping and distinct patterns of expression of barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> can be observed also in the brain .

to map out the temporal and spatial relationship between barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> expression and rgc differentiation, we compared their expression to the one of atoh <dig>  <cit> . the proneural bhlh  transcription factor atoh <dig> , homolog of drosophila atonal, has been shown to be essential for rgc differentiation in mouse, zebrafish and human  <cit>  and is transiently expressed in retinal precursors fated to become mainly rgcs, but also horizontal, photoreceptor and specific subpopulations of acs  <cit> . fish performed with barhl <dig> -cy <dig>  and atoh7-fitc  shows that at  <dig> hpf transcripts of both genes co-localize in the central retina . at 40hpf, atoh <dig> transcripts start to be downregulated in the mature rgcs of the central retina , while barhl <dig>  expression is maintained in this area . at this stage, we begin to observe a co-localization of barhl <dig>  with atoh <dig> within the cmz  clearly visible at 50hpf, . thus, barhl <dig>  expression overlaps and follows the expression of atoh <dig> with a slight delay, suggesting that atoh <dig> might directly or indirectly influence expression of barhl <dig>  in progenitors adopting the rgc fate. we then analyzed the expression of barhl <dig> with respect to the one of atoh <dig>  interestingly, in this case barhl <dig> expression is mostly complementary to the one of atoh <dig> . at  <dig> hpf, barhl <dig> starts to be expressed in a central retinal domain where atoh <dig> transcripts are already downregulated . later on, barhl <dig> expression expands towards the peripheral retina in a fan-like wave while atoh <dig> gets restricted to the cmz . at all stages analyzed, barhl <dig> and atoh <dig> expressions appear mostly mutually exclusive , although few cells co-expressing both genes are always visible at the expression boundaries . therefore, in contrast with barhl <dig> , the complementary expression of barhl <dig> and atoh <dig> suggests a reciprocal negative regulation between these two genes. to further investigate this aspect in vivo, we took the advantage of the atoh7-/- mutant embryos . in the atoh7-/- retina rgcs fail to exit the cell cycle and to differentiate as a result of a loss-of-function mutation within the atoh <dig> gene  <cit> . we tested how atoh <dig> loss-of-function and therefore lack of rgc differentiation affect the expression of barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> . in situ hybridization on embryos at  <dig> hpf shows that barhl <dig>  transcripts are completely missing in the gcl of the atoh7-/- retina , while barhl <dig> expression is retained in this mutant retina . the expression of both barhl paralogs in other brain areas, such as the tectum and the rhombic lips, is not affected by atoh <dig> loss . thus, barhl <dig>  appears to be sustained by atoh <dig> while barhl <dig> onset of expression appears independent on atoh <dig>  it remains to be demonstrated whether a negative feedback interaction exists between barhl <dig> and atoh <dig> 

identification of a novel barhl paralog in medaka
as it is commonly accepted that all teleosts underwent one further round of wgd, we wanted to test whether other teleosts have also retained more than two barhl and how their expression in the retina evolved. the medaka fish is a well-established model system and is therefore very suitable for a comparison with zebrafish  <cit> . so far, one barhl has been described in the medaka fish ; based on phylogenetic analysis olbarhl has been clustered within the barhl <dig> group of paralogs . interestingly, olbarhl <dig> is also expressed in the retina and in particular in the developing gcl  <cit> . in order to identify other putative barhl paralogs, we performed a blast search against the medaka genome  using zebrafish barhl proteins as queries. we could identify a second member of the medaka barhl family on chromosome  <dig>  by performing a multiple sequence alignment of barhl proteins, the newly identified medaka barhl was assigned to the barhl <dig> group . the newly identified barhl medaka protein has an asparagine residue instead of an alanine at position  <dig>  an aspartic acidic residue instead of a glutamic acid at position  <dig> as well as an alanine instead of serine at position  <dig> . the homeobox sequences of vertebrate barhl differ at these positions and clearly divide the genes in the two mentioned groups. the fil domains represent another set of highly conserved motifs  <cit> . only one of the fil domains, fil <dig>  can be found in both medaka barhl <dig> and barhl <dig> . to further characterize the evolutionary origin of the new medaka ortholog, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using drosophila barh <dig> and barh <dig> protostome outgroup . additionally, we rooted the tree with barhl protein sequences of the ancestral deuterostomes ciona savignyi and branchiostoma floridae, which we identified by blast search. ciona savignyi barhl and branchiostoma floridae barhl also cluster with the outgroup, as those two deuterostomes have not undergone the vertebrate-specific wdg and have only one ancestral barhl protein. the barhl proteins are clearly clustered in two groups, with the newly identified medaka sequence belonging to the barhl <dig> group. thus, medaka has one barhl <dig> and one barhl <dig> that relate to the homologs in other teleosts, as we would expect from the relationship among these teleost species. our tree clearly illustrates the relationship between zebrafish barhl <dig> paralogs and other teleosts barhl <dig> proteins and suggests that zebrafish barhl <dig>  has split basally from the teleost barhl <dig> group.

we then sought to compare the expression patterns of both medaka barhl <dig> and medaka barhl <dig> in the retina by in situ hybridization, using antisense probes against transcripts amplified from mixed stages-brain and eye cdna . medaka barhl <dig> starts to be expressed in the central retina at stage  <dig>  <cit> . this stage more or less corresponds to 28- <dig> hpf in zebrafish, when atoh <dig> expression and rgc differentiation begin  <cit> . later on, expression extends to the whole rgc layer  <cit> . we found that at stage  <dig>  the medaka barhl <dig> is still expressed in the gcl but is already being downregulated in the central retina . interestingly, this is the stage at which atoh <dig> expression also starts to be downregulated in the central retina in medaka  <cit> . on the other hand, the medaka barhl <dig> is still strongly expressed in the central retina . by stage  <dig>  medaka barhl <dig> transcripts can be detected only in the cmz  while medaka barhl <dig> is still strongly expressed in both the gcl and the inner part of the inl . thus, the expression domain of the medaka barhl <dig> appears very similar to that of the zebrafish barhl <dig>  as both transcripts can be found very early in the gcl and are very soon after restricted to the cmz. conversely, the medaka expression of barhl <dig> resembles the one observed for zebrafish barhl <dig>  as both can be found strongly expressed in the inl and gcl until late stages of development.

conserved gene synteny between barhl genes
has the retinal expression domain been lost by one of the barhl duplicates, or has it been acquired after divergence of the two duplicated genes? since the teleost branch underwent a wgd that did not affect other vertebrates, we expect to find two loci for each barhl gene in fish, which would explain the presence of two barhl <dig> paralogs in zebrafish, but only one paralog would have been retained in medaka. to further investigate this hypothesis, we compared the loci of barhl genes and looked for genes that are conserved in synteny. it has been proposed that genes that play important roles in development are surrounded by highly conserved elements and also show highly conserved gene synteny  <cit> . kikuta et al. elaborated on the highly conserved synteny between the human and zebrafish barhl <dig> loci that might extend to the regulatory level  <cit> . for a more in-depth analysis we used additional teleost species to take into account syntenic conservation within these rapidly evolving fish species  <cit> . we searched for genes that are in synteny between zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, tetraodon and human, and found that for both barhl <dig> and barhl <dig>  the conservation of the locus is very high, both for non-coding sequence as well as syntenic genes. genomic locations of all genes used in the analysis can be found in the additional file 1: table <dig>  figure 9a shows a model of the synteny relations between medaka, zebrafish and human. human barhl <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  orthologs of the genes surrounding barhl <dig> in human can be found on zebrafish chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  and medaka chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . this scenario is most likely the result of wgd in teleosts and highlights that the second medaka barhl <dig> paralog, expected to be conserved in synteny on chromosome  <dig> has been lost during evolution. for barhl <dig> we can observe a similar pattern: the genes surrounding barhl <dig> on human chromosome  <dig> can be found distributed between two chromosomes each in zebrafish and medaka. notably, in both teleost species only one duplicate of barhl <dig> has been retained. the fact that we found three or more genes that are conserved in their position as neighbours of barhl <dig> in loci that did not contain barhl <dig>  suggests that these chromosomal regions represent duplicated regions that did not retain a second barhl <dig> paralog. the loss of one barhl <dig> copy has been consistently observed in other teleosts species such as tetraodon and fugu whereas the barhl <dig> locus seems to have undergone different genomic rearrangements. indeed, in tetraodon we found that syntenic genes around barhl <dig> are distributed to three distinct loci, whereas in stickleback, they can be found in a single linkage group . altogether, the evolution of the barhl <dig> locus in teleosts, coupled to wgd and species-dependent regional duplication, seems to be to be under less evolutionary constraint than in the case of barhl <dig>  where a stereotypic pattern of gene distribution can be observed.

discussion
according to this study, we propose that vertebrates have two homologs of barhl  due to wgd events that occurred before the emergence of vertebrates. this is in contrast with drosophila, where two barh genes probably arose from tandem duplication in the same locus. it is a topic of speculation whether there have been one or two rounds of wgd in early vertebrate evolution before the split of the teleosts from the other jawed vertebrates, and currently the most widely accepted view is that there were two  <cit> . our findings are consistent with the latter view as the third paralog found in zebrafish most likely originated from the additional round of whole genome duplication that marked the rise of teleosts and did not affect other vertebrates  <cit> . this hypothesis is in agreement with the fact that in basal deuterostomes such as sea squirt and amphioxus, only one barhl locus could be found by blast search. from this speculation one would assume that all teleost fish once had at least three, maybe even four paralogs of barhl, some of which were lost. we found that in zebrafish both barhl <dig> and barhl <dig>  are expressed in the developing retina. barhl <dig> , like other vertebrate barhl <dig> homologs, is not expressed in the retina whereas the medaka barhl <dig> and barhl <dig> are both expressed in the retina in a similar fashion as barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> in zebrafish, thus suggesting that medaka barhl <dig> has a similar dynamic of transcriptional regulation as zebrafish barhl <dig> . given that the barhl expression in the retina is an ancestral feature that was already present in drosophila, the most parsimonious explanation for barhl <dig> gene evolution is that its retinal expression was maintained within the teleost lineage but was lost in xenopus and mammals. thereafter within teleosts, the zebrafish barhl <dig>  also lost its retinal expression probably due to a redundant function with barhl <dig>  and relaxed evolutionary pressure in its locus. this can be further illustrated in the context of the tetraodon barhl <dig> paralogs. these sequences do only resemble partial or split barhl proteins and therefore the positions in the tree are excluded from the teleost barhl <dig> cluster. we have called the split sequences tetraodon barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig>  and the protein that clusters within the teleost group barhl <dig> . in contrast, barhl <dig> protein sequences are arranged in correspondence with the evolution of the species, while the retinal expression of barhl <dig> has been conserved throughout the animal kingdom. this could be related to changes in function or regulation of barhl <dig> paralogs that led to diversification and, in some cases, retention rather than loss of a duplicate. unfortunately, without access to expression information for tetraodon and stickleback, no further hypothesis on the relationship of function and copy number can be made.

in line with these observations, our in situ hybridization analysis suggests that the zebrafish barhl <dig> expression pattern closely resembles that of barhl <dig> ortholog in other vertebrates, and therefore might play a role in the same neuronal lineages. the mouse barhl <dig> takes part in the specification of the acs, and later aspects of rgc maturation  <cit> . functional experiments will be necessary to test this hypothesis in zebrafish. it also remains to be demonstrated whether the expression of barhl <dig> within the gcl is restricted to displaced acs or rgcs or both, and whether part of barhl <dig> expression might be dependent on atoh <dig>  like in other vertebrates  <cit> . as the expression of atoh <dig> and barhl <dig> are mostly complementary, our hypothesis is that barhl <dig> transcriptional activation in the ac lineage is independent from atoh <dig>  other candidate factors might be at work in inducing barhl <dig>  particularly those factors that have been shown to favour ac fate at the expense of rgcs in zebrafish  <cit> . the striking complementary expression of atoh <dig> and barhl <dig> that we observed  would rather supports a negative feedback between the two genes. interestingly, similar mutually excluding expression domains have been found also in drosophila between the homolog atonal and bar genes  <cit> . in this study, a negative feedback has been shown to occur between the two drosophila genes, thus suggesting the conservation of an ancestral feature. the expression of barhl <dig> in the zebrafish atoh7-/- retina at  <dig> hpf appears to be retained in time but its pattern of expression is shifted towards the lens . most acs born at this stage become displaced in the presumptive gcl ; which might account for the localization of barhl <dig> expression in this domain. thus, our current data doesn't provide, neither it excludes evidences for negative feedback between atoh <dig> and barhl <dig> in zebrafish. in contrast to barhl <dig> , we found that barhl <dig>  is expressed in the zebrafish retina. surprisingly, this expression occurs nearly in synchrony with the one of atoh <dig> and the development of rgcs. similarly, we found that the medaka barhl <dig> spatio-temporal expression is reminiscent of what has been previously described for atoh <dig> expression in the medaka retina, being first detected at stage  <dig> and becoming restricted to the cmz at stage 30- <dig>  <cit> . this observation further supports the hypothesis of conserved dynamics of retinal lineages specification in both fish "twins", at least with respect to atoh <dig> and barhl genes. thus, due to this extreme similarity between barhl <dig>  and atoh <dig> expression within the rgc lineage, it is also possible that barhl <dig>  function became redundant with respect to the one of atoh <dig> and was therefore lost in the tetrapod lineage. in light of this intriguing hypothesis, it will be very interesting to ask what is the retained function of the zebrafish barhl <dig>  in the rgc lineage and in relation to atoh <dig> 

after branching of the metazoan clades into protostomes and deuterostomes, a tandem replication in drosophila melanogaster led to the existence of two bar factors in the fruit fly that are assumed to be redundant. in other insects, such as drosophila ananassae, anopheles or apis melifera, only one bar can be found . in the line of the deuterostomes, at least one round of wgd took place before the rise of the gnathostomes . we assume that before this period of intense genome rearrangement, there was only one barhl, as we can find in the genome sequences of branchiostoma floridae  or ciona savignyi . going further up in the evolutionary tree, at least two barhls could be found in every species we looked at. these observations raise the intriguing hypothesis that barhl factors have evolved in complexity proportional to the evolving diversity of retinal arrangement and rhabdomeric photoreceptor-derived cell types  <cit> . in summary, our study provides an example on how retained gene paralogs might have evolved in contributing to the specification of distinct cell-lineages in the vertebrate retina. a larger scale analysis of the functional implications of the differences in retinal key transcription factors between teleosts and other vertebrates will help to speculate further on the role of duplication retention in the evolution of vertebrates, and more specifically during eye evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our teleost comparison of barhl orthologs highlights differences in expression patterns within retinal cell populations and regarding atoh <dig> regulation. by extensive cross-species analysis of the barhl loci, these differences could be linked to differential selective pressure: while the barhl <dig> locus remains under evolutionary constraint, we show that the barhl <dig> locus rapidly evolves, thereby leading to functional differences within barhl <dig> paralogs. our cross-species analysis provides insights on how retained gene paralogs might have evolved in relation to distinct cell-lineages in the vertebrate retina.
