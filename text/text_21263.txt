BACKGROUND
since intraorganellar dna characteristics were found in chick embryo mitochondria  <cit> , determination of mitochondrial genomes  has become an important part of genome research. in  <dig>  anderson et al reported the complete sequence of the human mitogenome  <cit> . this was the first identified organellar genome. until recently,  <dig>  metazoan mitogenomes have now been determined . with a few exceptions  <cit> , animal mitogenomes always consist of the same  <dig> genes which incorporate  <dig> subunits of proteins involved in the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation, two ribosomal rnas , and  <dig> transfer rnas  . these sequences can provide large datasets for phylogenetic analyses at different levels also serving as ideal models of gene rearrangement and genome evolution.

 <dig> arthropod mitogenomes have been determined since clary and wolstenholme sequenced that of drosophila yakuba in  <dig>  <cit> . within the subphylum crustacea, only  <dig> mitogenomes have been determined: one for each of the classes cephalocarida, ostracoda, pentastomida and remipedia, four for the branchiopoda, eight for the maxillopoda and  <dig> for the malacostraca . within the order decapoda, the sampling is imbalanced: four for the suborder dendrobranchiata and ten for the pleocyemata . most decapod mitogenomes share the ancestral pancrustacean  gene order that shows only a trnl-uur translocation from the ancestral arthropod arrangement depicted by the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus  <cit> , or present only minor trna translocations. so far the anomuran mitogenome of the hermit crab pagurus longicarpus has been determined to show dramatic gene rearrangements, including that of several large fragments  <cit> .

hydrothermal vents were first discovered along the galápagos rift in  <dig>  <cit> . up to the present, their presence has been noted at mid-ocean spreading centers in the east pacific, atlantic, arctic and indian oceans, and in the back-arc basins in the west pacific . these vent environments are considered as extreme given the high pressure, the high temperature , the chemical toxicity of the fluids , and the total lack of photosynthetic production of animal nutrition. nevertheless, with the exception of chemoautotrophic bacteria that oxidize hydrogen sulfide emitted from vents, surprisingly a number of specialized large faunas were also observed in these vents. many invertebrates  often thrive with dramatically high densities, by utilizing symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria or grazing on or filter feeding upon free-living chemoautotrophs  <cit> . there are two main hypotheses about how vent faunas originate. the relic hypothesis derives principally from morphological analyses of extant vent taxa  <cit> , which considers the hydrothermal vent as a refugium for relic faunas during major historical extinction events. however, molecular studies of several vent-dominant taxa suggest that modern vent animals arose relatively recently  <cit> . an immigrating hypothesis seems more reasonable, which speculates that vent species may immigrate either from the non-vent environments or with close shallow-water relatives .

thanks to the effective crustacea-specific versatile primers  <cit> , mitochondrial dna fragments can be used for studying the occurrence and dispersal of these vent species  <cit> . however, no entire mitogenome data has been available for any vent species to date. baba and williams first identified shinkaia crosnieri at the bismarck archipelago and in the okinawa trough in the west pacific ocean  <cit> . the discoverers placed it into decapoda: anomura: galatheidae according to its morphological features. chan et al also mentioned this species as the first known hydrothermal crustacean in taiwan  <cit> . gathering near the top of the vents, s. crosnieri probably feed on polychaetes and "culture" filamentous bacteria on their abdominal surface  <cit> . no genetic data has been characterized for this species so far.

here, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the s. crosnieri mitogenome. it consists of the same  <dig> protein-coding genes, two rrnas but only  <dig> trnas, with trns-ucn, trnw, trnc and trny missing from the usual structure. a mechanism of nuclear dna-encoded trna import was addressed. furthermore, the genes show surprising rearrangements from the ancestral pancrustacean order. phylogenetic analyses indicate its close relationship with p. longicapus. no significant difference was found in the codon usage, nucleotide composition and bias. our results may provide useful information on both genomics and the evolution of hydrothermal vent faunas.

RESULTS
mitogenome organization
the mitochondrial genome of the hydrothermal vent galatheid crab shinkaia crosnieri is a  <dig> -bp circular molecule . it is the smallest mitogenome found in the malacostraca  to date. the genome contains the same  <dig> protein-coding genes and two ribosomal rnas as in most metazoans. however, it exhibits incomplete transfer rna encoding .  <dig> mitochondrial genes are transcribed from one strand  and the remaining  <dig> from the other . totally  <dig> non-coding nucleotides exist intergenically, with the largest continuous region  between trnq and rrns. due to its location and at-richness, we considered this part of the genome as a non-coding control region in the similar manner as in the case of the australian freshwater crayfish cherax destructor  <cit> . however, the control region is considerably smaller than those of any other decapods  and shows no similarities with any previous decapod control region . in the case of pagurus longicarpus  <cit> , approximately  <dig> bp of the control region remain unsequenced due to technical difficulties. furthermore, as found in many mitogenomes, some genes overlap. atp8/atp <dig> and nad4l/nad <dig> each share seven nucleotides, although they are located on different reading frames. no further overlap of over two nucleotides was identified. table  <dig> shows a summary of the s. crosnieri mitogenome organization.

a plus strand /minus strand 

b negative values represent overlapping nucleotides.

protein-coding genes and ribosomal rnas
for the protein-coding genes, nine  are encoded in the plus strand while the remaining four  in the minus strand . this orientation is shared by all decapod mitogenomes sequenced to date.  <dig> out of the  <dig> protein-coding genes appear to start with the codon atn , typical for metazoan mitogenomes  <cit> . the cox <dig> initiates with gtt, in a case identical to neocalanus cristatus  <cit> . eight genes possess taa as their termination codons . truncated termination codons  are observed in cox1— <dig>  nad4— <dig> and cob. post-transcriptional polyadenylation can subsequently generate mature taa codons  <cit> .

the rrnl and rrns genes of s. crosnieri are  <dig>   and  <dig> bp  in length, respectively. the lengths are among values typical for crustaceans whereas the at contents are slightly higher than those of other decapod counterparts .

transfer rnas
we analyzed the entire sequences of the genome and successfully identified  <dig> trna genes by their potential secondary structures . trnascan-se determined  <dig> of them. the only manually folded trns-agn exhibits three mismatches on the acceptor stem while its dhu, tΨc and anticodon stems appear intact and well paired. the tΨc arm of trns-agn is often extremely short or completely missing in arthropods  <cit> . besides trns-agn, each of trni, trnk and trnl-cun bears a mismatch on the acceptor stem. usually trnas with a u in the wobble position  of the anticodons recognize either four-fold degenerate or nnr codons; those with a g in this position only recognize nny codons. all trnas of s. crosnieri mitogenome obey this rule except for trnm, whose anticodon cau recognizes both atg and ata. the c can be post-transcriptionally modified to 5-formylcytidine to pair with the ata codon  <cit> .

trns-ucn, trnw, trnc and trny are missing from the s. crosnieri mitogenome. we analyzed all fractions between protein-coding or ribosomal rna genes , but no extra trnas or similar sequences were identified in the genome. this is not an exception in arthropods considering the absence of trnq in the mitogenome of the whitefly aleurodicus dugesii, trns-agn in the aphid schizaphis graminum  <cit> , and trnd in the scorpion centruroides limpidus  <cit> . deficiencies of trna genes were often observed in protozoans, fungi, algae, plants and low metazoans . in these cases, the mechanism of nuclear dna-encoded trna import proves responsible for mitochondrial trna compensation. furthermore, marsupial mitochondrial trnas show interesting patterns. janke and paabo identified a pseudogene-like trnd in didelphis virginiana, as its anticodon is gcc instead of the usual guc  <cit> . they found that the cytosine is changed to uridine under a post-transcriptional rna editing. dorner et al discovered a trnk pseudogene in the same marsupial species by observing its non-functional secondary structure  <cit> . cytoplasmic trna import rather than rna editing solves this problem. in our study, there seems no candidate template for rna editing. the mechanism of trna import is therefore a plausible explanation.

nucleotide composition and codon usage
the nucleotide composition of s. crosnieri mitogenome is as follows: a =  <dig>  , g =  <dig>  , t =  <dig>   and c =  <dig>  . the genome has an overall at content of  <dig> %, which appears high for decapods , but is a little lower than that of geothelphusa dehaani  <cit> . the composition is strongly skewed away from g in favor of c  while almost balanced for a and t . this feature is well conserved within decapods . in mammals, the duration of single-stranded state of the "heavy-stranded" genes during mitochondrial dna replication can explain this asymmetry  <cit> . whether or not the same explanation works on our results remains difficult to predict at this time due to the scarcity of information regarding dna replication of invertebrate mitochondria.

the s. crosnieri mitogenome totally encodes  <dig>  amino acids of protein-coding genes. table  <dig> shows the codon usage. although four trnas are absent, the corresponding codons  <dig> tcns,  <dig> tgrs,  <dig> tgys and  <dig> tays  are used quite frequently , evidently raising the need for trna compensation. we observed a strong at-bias  in the third codon positions, similar to those in the anomura relative p. longicarpus, the brachyura and the suborder dendrobranchiata . the values in the caridea, palinura and astacidea are relatively lower .

a the corresponding trnas are missing in the mitogenome.

gene rearrangements
the s. crosnieri mitogenome shows a novel arrangement within arthropods. the gene order diverges in many positions from that of the ancestral pancrustacean pattern shared by lots of crustaceans and hexapods  <cit> . totally, we identified at least six rearrangements in this species . two rearrangements involve protein-coding genes while the remainders are trna translocations. a major fragment containing nad <dig>  trnl-cun, rrnl, trnv, rrns, control region and trnq moves to upstream of nad <dig> from its ancestral position; trni may translocate before or after this event. the fraction trnm-nad <dig> moves to upstream of trnd. this event, together with the trng translocations, indicates potential synapomorphic characters for the anomura. the location of trnr-trnn changes to downstream of cox <dig>  the trnp moves to downstream of nad <dig>  p. longicarpus  <cit>  and eriocheir sinesis  <cit>  share this rearrangement. finally, the trni moves to the middle of nad <dig> and trna. this translocation is novel within crustaceans. rearrangements of trni were observed in speleonectes tulumensis  <cit>  and tigriopus japonicus  <cit> , where trni is translocated to different positions in both species. morrison et al inferred parsimonious rearrangements of the crab-like form  <cit> . they pointed out that the galatheoidea diverged after the translocations of trnq and trni-trnm-nad <dig>  our results support their hypothesis.

we also analyzed data gathered thus far on rearrangements of both decapod  and all pancrustacean mitogenomes . for simplicity of analysis, all trnas and control regions  were excluded in the case of the pancrustaceans. the e. sinensis mitogenome shows the maximum  <dig> block interchanges within the decapoda, and shinkaia crosnieri exhibits  <dig> interchanges from the ancestral pancrustacean arrangement on its mitogenome . the ancestral pancrustacean pattern depicted by four dendrobranchiatans, two carideans and one palinuran, has only a trnl-uur translocation from the ancestral arthropod order of limulus polyphemus  <cit> . in the analyses of large block  rearrangements of all pancrustaceans, the class maxillopoda shows maximum inversions  within crustaceans. in the case of the hexapoda , all large block rearrangements have happened within the class insecta , where more rearrangements  were observed within the orders phthiraptera and thysanoptera.

phylogenetic analysis
we used both nucleotide and amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes for the intraorder phylogenetic analyses. for each dataset, the maximum likelihood  and bayesian analysis gave the same tree topology  while the maximum parsimony  analysis of the nucleotides showed a minor difference . the nucleotide and amino acid trees are nearly the same except for the position of the caridea clade  and the inner structure of the dendrobranchiata clade. in the case of the nucleotides, the clade is placed together with other pleocyematans , but not well supported . however, in the amino acid tree, the caridea shows a sister position of the dendrobranchiata , which also remains modestly statistically supported . therefore, according to our results, whether the pleocyemata is monophyletic or paraphyletic appears ambiguous. the dendrobranchiata clade was well reconstructed in the ml and bayesian analyses of the nucleotide dataset  but unresolved in the case of the mp analysis of the nucleotides and in all three analyses of the amino acids . the relationship )) is more believable, as discussed in  <cit> . in both trees, the two anomurans  form a separate clade, according with the relationship derived from the morphology  <cit> . whether or not the anomura is monophyletic needs intensive sampling. in fact, phylogenetic relationships within this infraorder remain largely unsettled . furthermore, no unexpectedly long or short branch length of s. crosnieri was observed , indicating that the evolutionary acceleration/retardation is probably not evident for this vent species. accurate calculation on evolutionary rates needs fossil records that remain absent for these vent taxa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first determination of the mitochondrial genome of a hydrothermal vent organism. it not only enlarges sampling with the crustcean, but more importantly, provides useful information for understanding the evolutionary history of vent species.

the mitogenome of shinkaia crosnieri exhibits almost the same characteristics with those of other metazoans with the exception of two differences. firstly, four transfer rnas are missing from the mitogenome. the codons recognized by these four trnas are frequently used  for protein encoding. we proposed a mechanism of nuclear dna-encoded trna import for this compensation. secondly, the arrangement of the gene contents is significantly different from those of other pancrustacen mitogenomes. the changes are complicated and at least six rearrangements were observed. some of them are shared by other crustaceans. however a novel trni translocation was identified.

the codon usage, nucleotide composition and bias of s. crosnieri mitogenome are similar with other decapods. phylogenetic analysis shows a close relationship with another anomuran pagurus longicarpus, supporting for the taxonomic classification by the morphology  <cit> . no trend of evolutionary acceleration or retardation was observed. an exterior origin may explain these conserved features found in s. crosnieri. in fact, one galatheid, munidopsis subsquamosa, seems to be a non-vent species which can invade vent habitats for at least short periods of time  <cit> . our results may provide some evidence for the immigrating hypothesis about how hydrothermal vent species originate.
