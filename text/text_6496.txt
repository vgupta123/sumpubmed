BACKGROUND
endogenous retroviruses  are genomic elements present in the genomes of almost all vertebrates. they evolved from exogenous retroviruses that were incorporated into the genome and became part of the host genome  <cit> .

in the bovidae family, ervs have been analyzed in most detail in domestic sheep  and cattle . the former are a good model of the coevolution of retroviruses and the host genome due to the interaction between the jsrv virus, its endogenous counterpart and the host  <cit> ; and the latter have been studied in depth to detect ervs  <cit>  because the cattle genome was the first to be sequenced among ruminants  <cit> . in total, more than  <dig>  retroviral elements have been detected in cattle. some of them are classified into  <dig> bovine endogenous retrovirus  families, and because enjsrv has been detected in some breeds but not in others, variability in endogenous retroviruses among breeds has been proposed  <cit> .

however, the distribution of related boervs in other closely related species remains unknown, although the presence of some ervs in yaks and goats has been detected by southern blotting  <cit> . fortunately, more and more data have been generated for different species in the bovidae family. the genomes of zebus   <cit> , yaks   <cit> , water buffalo   <cit>  and goats   <cit>  have been recently released, and the genomes of domestic sheep, bighorn sheep  and dall sheep  are currently being sequenced  <cit> .

the study of related boervs harbored by different species could aid in the study of specific evolutionary processes. for example, it may be possible to measure the utility of the use of ltr divergence to estimate the integration time of ervs because we could detect the ervs of different species which are inherited from the common ancestor of the three bos species. ltr divergence has been used for this purpose  <cit> , although there are some concerns about its utility  <cit> . in addition, the selective pressure affecting different genes of closely related boervs could be analyzed because purifying selection has been detected in different ervs, especially in the pol gene  <cit> .

thus, using different computational approaches, we analyzed  the genome-wide presence of known and new ervs in cattle, zebus and yaks and  the presence of known boerv families in these species and five other species, namely water buffalo, domestic sheep, bighorn sheep, dall sheep and goats.

RESULTS
detection and comparison of endogenous retroviruses in cattle, zebus and yaks
the cattle genome was previously analyzed to detect endogenous retroviruses using three different computational approaches  <cit> . however, to make the results comparable with those for two other species, zebus and yaks, this genome was reanalyzed combining ltrharvest  <cit> , to find elements with long terminal repeats , and ltrdigest  <cit> , to annotate the elements found. these programs were selected because of their efficiency in time and resources and the easiness to parse the great amount of data generated.

ltrharvest identified  <dig>  elements with ltrs in cattle,  <dig>  in zebus and  <dig>  in yaks . their position in chromosomes or contigs are showed in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  because some of these elements could represent incomplete proviruses, ltrdigest was used to annotate retroviral features, especially retroviral genes or regions of retroviral genes, that is, gag, pol or env genes or one of the regions of these genes . in total,  <dig> elements from cattle,  <dig> elements from zebus and  <dig> from yaks had at least one retroviral gene or region of retroviral genes . these elements are more likely to be ervs because they each contain an ltr and at least one retroviral gene or region of retroviral genes. in the case of cattle, among the  <dig> detected elements,  <dig> were detected in our previous work  <cit> . in the three species, regions from the pol gene  were the most frequently detected retroviral regions, and the env gene was the least frequently detected . in addition, the most common structures in the detected ervs were ltr-pol-ltr, numbering  <dig>  in cattle,  <dig>  in zebus and  <dig>  in yaks. the complete structure was detected in  <dig> elements  in cattle,  <dig>  in zebus and  <dig>  in yaks.

the elements detected by ltrharvest were better characterized. first, the elements were searched for a reverse transcriptase region using blast. a total of  <dig> erv sequences from cattle,  <dig> from zebus and  <dig> from yaks were used to detect the presence of previously described families of boervs . eighteen out of the  <dig> families were detected in cattle,  <dig> were detected in zebus and  <dig> were detected in yaks. in addition, there were six groups of sequences that did not cluster with previously described families, and these sequences were considered new families and were named boerv <dig> to boerv <dig>  there were also three previously defined families  that were not detected in this analysis. last, there was a cluster of sequences that were weakly related to boerv <dig> that was named boerv15-like  . all detected families belonged to the class i  and class ii  erv classes. no class iii family members were detected .

presence of bovine ervs in other species of the bovidae family
to detect the presence of boerv families in different species belonging to the bovidae family, a search for the  <dig> boerv families was performed in water buffalo, domestic sheep and goats using blast. due to the lack of assembly of the genomes of buffalo, bighorn sheep and dall sheep, the mummer program was used to map the available reads of these species to the sequences of the pol genes of the  <dig> boerv families. twenty-six of the boerv families were detected in all the species analyzed, including the  <dig> families that were not detected using ltrharvest and ltrdigest , and thus, these families of ervs could be present in all members of the bovidae family. the analysis of the species different from those analyzed in this work could confirm this point. four families  were not detected in sheep or goats, so they seem to be specific to the bovinae subfamily . three of these families specific to the bovinae subfamily were class ii ervs and one was a class i erv. thus, the majority of the boerv families were inserted into the genome of the common ancestor of the bovidae family approximately  <dig> million years ago  or earlier. later, insertions of ancestors of four families could occur in the common ancestor of the bovinae subfamily, between 12mya and 20mya . strikingly, the boerv <dig> family was detected in all species except water buffalo . regarding the insertion time based on ltr divergence, boerv <dig> family entered bos species between 34– <dig> mya, that is, previous to the divergence of bovidae family . thus, the lack of detection of the boerv <dig> family in buffalo could be due to the loss of this family in this species. in the case of boerv <dig> family, it was detected in all species except sheep and goat . regarding its insertion, boerv <dig> family entered bos species between 29-12mya, a span of time covering the split of caprinae and bovinae subfamilies. since the majority of reads mapped in a short segment of the query sequence, the high number of reads mapped to boerv <dig> in buffalo, bighorn sheep and dall sheep could be a side-effect of detecting another repetitive element such us bovb line. thus, more species of the bovidae family should be analysed to clarify the insertion and evolutionary pathway of these families.

clusters of ervs from different bos species
the phylogenetic analysis based on the ervs detected in bos species  showed that, frequently, ervs from different species clustered together significantly; these ervs are likely the same provirus in different species. in total, there were  <dig> clusters of ervs . based on their ltrs and retroviral genes, the integration times and selective pressures acting on these ervs were analyzed.

two methods have been applied to estimate the integration time of clustered ervs: 1) the method proposed by martins and villesen  <cit> , which is based on the divergence of the ltrs and the distances based on phylogenetic trees, and 2) the widely used method based on the divergence of ltrs and fixed substitution rates . four clusters of ervs  were not analyzed further because the phylogenetic tree of their ltrs was not consistent with the relationships among the species . the estimates of the integration time determined using both methods were similar for  <dig> clusters of ervs and different for  <dig> clusters of ervs . thus, the use of fixed rate or estimated rate implied a critical difference.

insertion time of each cluster of ervs was estimated by two methods:  phylogeny based substitution rate: ltr divergence /   <cit>  and  using the ltr divergence and fixed substitution rate of  <dig> x10- <dig> and 5x10- <dig> <cit> . btau, bos taurus; bind, bos indicus; bgru, bos grunniens. clusters of ervs are showed in figure  <dig>  na, the phylogenetic relationship of ltrs of clusters of ervs did not follow the species relationship.

the use of methods of ltr divergence rely on the assumption that the ltr divergences are constant between species and the violation of this assumption complicate the use of molecular clock and, therefore, the use of these methods, so the ltr divergence of each species was compared . in the case of ervs from cattle and zebus, the divergence of the ltrs was similar because the regression coefficient  based on the kimura  <dig> parameter distance was  <dig>  . however, in both the cattle-yak and zebu-yak comparisons, the differences were higher  .

clustered ervs were also used to assess selective pressure. most retroviral genes and regions of genes of clustered of ervs were under purifying selection because their dn/ds ratio was < <dig> . however, in some clustered of ervs, the dn/ds ratio was greater than  <dig>  especially in the dutpase and reverse transcriptase regions .

discussion
in this work, the variability in the number of bovine endogenous retroviruses and in the retrovirus families represented was analyzed in different species of the bovidae family with the aim of improving our knowledge of these genomic elements in bovids.

in cattle, approximately  <dig>  putative ervs were previously detected in btau_ <dig>  genome version for cattle using three different computational tools   <cit> . in this work, the bos_ <dig> _umd genome version was analysed using ltrharvest and ltrdigest. these programs were selected due to their advantages with respect to the speed of the analysis and the possibility of customization.

the results obtained in this genome version combining ltrharvest and ltrdigest suggested that  <dig> elements could be endogenous retroviruses, being  <dig> of them detected in our previous work  <cit> . the detection of new putative ervs could be a consequence of the use of a newer version of the assembly of the cattle genome and the use of different programs. in our previous works  <cit> , most of the ervs were detected by only one program while the ervs detected by two programs or more were minority as previously suggested  <cit> , to detect transposable elements the use of different computational tools is advisable since each tool gives different information. so, the use of another approach, in this case ltrharvest and ltr digest, followed this trend and new ervs could be detected.

ltrharvest finds elements with ltrs, so in the case of ervs that have lost one of their ltrs or one of the ltrs is not recognizable, they could not be detected and, therefore, analyzed. the clearest example of this limitation is the lack of detection of boerv <dig>  boerv <dig> and boerv <dig> in the analysis using ltrharvest and ltrdigest and their subsequent detection using searches based on blast.

detection of boervs
to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first genome-wide analysis of ervs in zebus and yaks. class ii ervs have previously been detected in yaks by experimental means  <cit> . in this work, both class i and ii ervs were detected in both zebus and yaks.

the de novo search for ervs and the specific search for boerv families detected a total of  <dig> erv families, six of which are new, in the three analyzed species of the bos genus. in both analyses, more ervs were detected in cattle than in the other two species, and zebus had an intermediate number. two reasons could explain these differences: 1) the differences in the genome assemblies and the sequencing methods: the assembly of cattle genome has full representation of chromosomes, a coverage of 9x and sequenced using sanger  <cit> ; while the assembly zebu has a full representation at contig level, a coverage of 52x and sequenced using solid  <cit> ; and yak has a full representation at scaffold level, a coverage of 65x and sequenced using illumina hiseq and illumina ga  <cit> . in addition, sometimes there are problems with the assembly of repetitive elements  <cit> , so the lack of ervs in zebu and yak could be an additive effect of quality of genome sequencing and the usual bias mapping repetitive elements. 2) an expansion of retroviral copies in the common ancestor of cattle and zebus and continued expansion in cattle after the split because the number of elements in cattle was twice that in the two other species.

evolutionary history of boerv families
almost all boerv families were detected in the analyzed species of the bovidae family. thus,  <dig> of the  <dig> boerv families could have been present in the common ancestor of the bovidae family . for these families, similar numbers of copies were detected in yaks, goats and domestic sheep, and more copies were detected in cattle and zebus. thus, an increase in the copy number in cattle and zebus could be possible.

three out of the four families specific to the bovinae subfamily were from class ii, a class of ervs related to betaretroviruses. given that 1) class ii elements are the most abundant ervs in rats and mice  <cit> , 2) an erv family with recent activity in humans, the herv-k family  <cit> , belongs to class ii and 3) the most studied erv of domestic sheep  <cit>  is the endogenous counterpart of jsrv virus, a betaretrovirus, class ii retroviruses could have been active until recently in some groups of mammals.

the high number of reads that mapped to the boerv <dig> and boerv <dig> families in water buffalo, bighorn sheep and dall sheep is difficult to understand because the copy numbers of these families were not remarkable in bos species, domestic sheep or goats. the reads in boerv <dig> were located between positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the reverse transcriptase sequence used, and this segment is highly similar to the bov-b line/sine, a transposable element present in some vertebrates  <cit> . the high number of reads that mapped to these families could be a) due to their similarity to other genomic elements, or b) that these two families were more successful in these species.

clustered ervs and evolutionary implications
the estimation of the integration time of ervs based on ltr divergence is a controversial issue due to several limitations of this approach, such as gene conversion between ltrs  <cit> . this work provides a convenient scenario in which to test the usefulness of ltr divergence as a measure of the integration time. in this work, two different methods were used: one based on a phylogeny-based substitution rate and the other based on a fixed substitution rate. discrepancies between species have arisen. thus, the comparison of the divergences of clustered ervs could be helpful in this scenario.

we assumed that clustered ervs should have similar levels of divergence in their ltrs, and we found that the deviation from this assumption was lower in the cattle-zebu comparison than in the cattle-yak and zebu-yak comparisons. thus, among other conclusions  <cit> , it appears that divergence between species could also affect the divergence of ltrs, most likely due to the differences in the genomes since their split. in the case of yaks, genomic differences relative to cattle have been detected due to the adaptation of yaks to high altitudes  <cit> .

the purifying selection acting on ervs in some specific families or groups is a general phenomenon that has been detected in humans  <cit>  and crocodiles  <cit> , mainly in the protease, reverse transcriptase and env genes of ervs. in addition, purifying selection was detected in a homologous env gene retrieved from  <dig> simian species  <cit> . in this work, the selection analyses were extended to gag gene and pol gene was analyzed in-depth, so in total seven genes or regions of retroviral genes of clustered of ervs from different species were analyzed. in addition to the env gene, purifying selection was also detected in the gag, dutpase, integrase and rnaseh genes. the evolutionary conservation of clustered ervs detected in this work suggests the lack of detrimental effects of these proviruses on their hosts. thus, we can speculate that the genes or regions of genes from these ervs could be a reservoir of functional elements that could be domesticated. similarly, purifying selection has been detected in domesticated genes such as the syncitin genes of ruminants  <cit> , carnivore  <cit>  and primates  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, previously described bovine endogenous retrovirus families were detected in other members of the bovidae family. in addition, six previously undescribed erv families were characterized. among all these families,  <dig> were found in more than one species of the bovidae family. thus, most of these boerv families could have been present in the common ancestor of the bovidae.

most of the specific erv families detected in species from the bovinae subfamily were from class ii, a retroviral class active in other mammals. in addition, the high number of boervs detected in cattle suggests that an additional expansion of retroviral copies could have occurred in this species.

when two methods to estimate ltr divergence as a measure of the insertion time were compared, a deviation in the ltr divergence of clusters of retroviral copies was detected, adding new concerns regarding the use of ltrs to estimate the insertion time of erv copies, that is, the violation of the molecular clock. purifying selection acting on clusters of ervs from different species of the bos genus was detected, extending the detection of this type of selection to new erv regions  and detecting purifying selection among other bos species.
