BACKGROUND
the dna repair protein poly polymerase- <dig>  is one of the first proteins localized to foci of dna damage  <cit> . although parp- <dig> itself lacks any dna-repair activity, interaction with damaged dna stimulates the nad+-dependent polyation activity of parp- <dig>  <cit> . the trans-polyation of target proteins, including dna packaging proteins  <cit> , is postulated to reduce the dna-binding affinity of these target proteins resulting in decondensation and accumulation of dna-repair proteins to sites on the damaged dna  <cit> . polyation also regulates various proteins involved in cell cycle control  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit>  and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . parp- <dig> is itself also a target of automodification by poly which is important for the repair of alkylating agent-induced dna damage  <cit> . the dna damage detection, signalling, and recruitment roles of parp- <dig> in maintenance of genomic integrity has made it an important target of anti-cancer therapies  <cit> .

full-length parp- <dig> is a six domain protein, with each of the six domains  encompassing a distinct functional role important in parp- <dig> activation, localization and activity . the first three n-terminal domains , are zinc finger dna binding domains with distinct functions in parp- <dig> dna-nick mediated activation  <cit> . the central, auto-modification region of parp- <dig> , contains a brct domain , as well as flanking segments containing glutamate  <cit>  or lysine  <cit>  residues that have been reported to serve as sites of auto-adp ribosylation. domain d is additionally implicated in mediating protein:protein interactions with the central brct domain of the dna repair scaffolding protein x-ray cross complementing group  <dig> protein   <cit> , which in turn is constitutively bound to base-excision repair protein dna ligase iii-α  <cit>  and interacts transiently with various dna repair proteins  <cit>  . adjacent to domain d, is a wgr domain  followed by the catalytic domain , which possesses activities related to the adp-ribose adduct formation, elongation, and branching activity, characteristic of this enzyme  <cit> .

the auto-modification brct domain of parp- <dig> is required for efficient repair of dna damage; however, there has been limited biophysical characterization of this domain  <cit> . to better understand the parp- <dig> brct domain and its role in recruitment of xrcc1-bound dna repair factors, we determined the solution nmr structure of this isolated domain, characterized its solution behaviour using small-angle x-ray scattering and gel-filtration chromatography, and identified its thermal melting point with circular dichroism. as brct domains are known to form both homodimeric and heterodimeric protein interactions  <cit> , and parp- <dig> has previously been demonstrated to be a homodimer  <cit> , we also investigated the quaternary interactions of the isolated parp- <dig> brct domain. the parp- <dig> brct domain is also implicated in mediating protein interactions with the central brct domain of xrcc <dig>  and it has been unclear whether an interaction occurs in the absence of ation of either binding partner  <cit> . in addition to the isolated parp- <dig> brct domain, longer parp- <dig> constructs comprising domains a through d, were prepared and studied to further elucidate this interaction between the central brct domain of xrcc <dig> and that of parp- <dig> 

RESULTS
gel-filtration of the parp- <dig> brct domain
brct domains are known to mediate both heterodimeric and homodimeric protein interactions and the parp- <dig> brct domain was previously demonstrated to readily form a homodimer under physiologically-relevant conditions  <cit> . gel-filtration chromatography of the parp- <dig> brct domain  was carried out to determine the quaternary state of the isolated domain. the parp- <dig> brct domain elutes from the gel-filtration column at an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  kda , consistent with a monomeric quaternary state of the  <dig>  kda protein, and with our molecular mass determination using small-angle x-ray scattering data . the previous studies demonstrating that the parp- <dig> brct exists as a homodimer  <cit>  were carried out with a construct that had two purification tags . the construct was also longer at the n-terminus and was shorter by  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus than the construct used in our experiments. it has been shown that the linker regions connecting tandem brct domains , and more recently the linker region preceding an isolated brct domain , play important roles in complex formation. therefore we carried out gel-filtration experiments with a construct consisting of domain c through the parp- <dig> brct domain  in order to determine if the longer construct would promote formation of homodimers. the parp- <dig> c-d construct elutes from the gel-filtration column at an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  kda , consistent with monomeric quaternary state of the  <dig>  kda construct. we postulate that the previously-reported homodimers of the parp- <dig> brct domain may have been formed as a result of the purification tags used, or due to the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces resulting from truncation of the c-terminus.

protein interactions of the parp- <dig> brct domain
the parp- <dig> brct domain has been demonstrated to interact with the first brct domain from xrcc <dig>   <cit> . we sought to characterize this interaction using gel-filtration chromatography. addition of equimolar amounts of parp- <dig> brct and x1brcta to the gel-filtration column produced a single peak with a small shoulder on the gel-filtration elution profile . however, the apparent molecular mass derived from the peak positions was consistent with co-eluting monomers rather than with the formation of a stable dimer under the conditions used. addition of equimolar amounts of parp- <dig> c-d and x1brcta also produced two peaks in the gel-filtration experiments, with each peak position consistent with the corresponding monomeric component .

previous characterization of the interaction of x1brcta with parp- <dig> brct indicated a simultaneous interaction of x1brcta with the a and d domains of parp- <dig>  <cit> . gel-filtration experiments were used to ascertain if a protein interaction could be detected with the parp- <dig> a domain or the parp- <dig> a-d domains . addition of equimolar amounts of parp- <dig> a and x1brcta produced a single peak, consistent with co-elution of monomeric x1brcta and parp- <dig> a. addition of equimolar amounts of parp- <dig> a-d and x1brcta produced two peaks, consistent with the peak position of each monomer . because the previous characterization of the interaction of x1brcta with parp- <dig> employed an x1brcta construct that was longer at the n-terminus  <cit> , we sought to determine if the inability to detect an interaction could be due to the absence of this specific region. in addition to extending the n-terminus of x1brcta by  <dig> amino acids, the c-terminus was also extended by  <dig> amino acids  . interestingly, the longer construct exhibited a substantially greater level of expression, ~ 10-fold increase. however, as with x1brcta, no interaction could be detected with any of the parp- <dig> constructs . although the predicted molecular mass for this longer xrcc <dig> construct is  <dig>  kda, it elutes from the gel-filtration column at an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  kda ; x1brcta elutes from the gel-filtration column at an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  kda compared with a predicted m.w. =  <dig>  kd .

thermal stability of the parp- <dig> brct domain
circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to assess the thermal stability of the parp- <dig> brct domain. the ellipticity exhibited an irreversible thermal transition with a melting temperature of  <dig> °c, suggesting that the domain is marginally stable at physiological temperatures . in full-length parp- <dig>  the linkers connecting our parp- <dig> brct <dig> domain construct with the adjacent domains are relatively short; therefore it is possible that interactions with these domains are involved in stabilization of the brct domain when part of the full-length protein. since the parp <dig> structure is characterized by strongly electropositive regions on its surface , and there are multiple sites of adp ribosylation at residues adjacent to this domain  <cit> , it is possible that this modification stabilizes the parp <dig> brct domain.

small-angle x-ray scattering of the parp- <dig> brct domain
the solution structure and quaternary state of the parp- <dig> brct domain was investigated using small-angle x-ray scattering . guinier analysis of the low q regions yielded an rg value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å, averaged over three concentrations, with dmax values of 44- <dig> Å. no significant variation in rg was observed upon dilution . comparison of the intensity at zero scattering angle  of the parp- <dig> brct, with a standard protein  was used to determine an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kda over a concentration range  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm . the experimentally determined molecular mass is similar to the mass calculated based on amino acid composition , indicating that this domain is in a monomeric state even at high concentrations. an ab initio model of the parp- <dig> brct domain was constructed from the i scattering data using the program gasbor  <cit> . the resulting model has an overall globular shape consistent with the known fold of monomeric brct domains and not with models of dimeric brct domains .

solution structure of the parp- <dig> brct domain
structural characterization of brct domains provides the basis for understanding the roles of various residues in supporting intermolecular interactions  <cit> . we therefore sought to determine the three dimensional structure of the parp- <dig> brct domain to gain insights into parp- <dig> protein:protein interactions. attempts to crystallize the parp- <dig> brct domain were unsuccessful. the  <dig> mhz 1h-15n hsqc nmr spectrum is characterized by well dispersed resonances of even intensity indicating that in solution, the parp- <dig> brct is folded and well behaved . it apparently does not aggregate, and lacks significant intermediate conformational exchange behavior that would lead to resonance broadening. we thus were able to determine the solution structure of a u--labelled  <dig>  mm parp- <dig> brct domain sample. all of the 15n and 13c assignments, and noe data, were collected on a single sample. not including the hexahistidine tag, the proton assignments were  <dig> % complete as assessed by cyana  <cit> . cyana assigned  <dig> noe restraints as categorized in table  <dig>  the conformational ensemble was characterized by less than one noe violation per structure. the restraints were converted to xplor-nih format, and the structures were refined. final statistics regarding the quality of the structures are provided in table  <dig>  the final xplor-nih refinement  <cit>  resulted in an ensemble of the ten lowest energy structures with a backbone rmsd of  <dig>  Å and an all-heavy-atom rmsd of  <dig>  Å for the ordered residues. this is compared with  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å rmsd for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively, when considering the whole molecule. a total of  <dig> % of structured residues are in the favored region of ramachandran space and  <dig> % are in the allowed ramachandran region. a superposition of the ten lowest energy structures obtained from xplor-nih is shown in figure 4b. the solution structure determined by nmr and the calculated rg value of the nmr model  is in agreement with the saxs-based model  . at neutral ph, the parp brct domain is strongly electropositive , and the surface of the protein is characterized by several clusters of positively charged lysine residues . this electrostatic surface, in combination with the reported polyadp-ribosylation of residues adjacent to the brct domain, suggests that there may be some type of electrostatic interaction between this surface and the polyadp-ribose backbone, perhaps acting to stabilize the structure in the absence of binding partners. additionally, the fold of the rat parp <dig> brct domain is essentially identical with that of the corresponding unpublished human brct domain , with which it shares  <dig> % sequence identity.

the parp- <dig> brct domain has the globular α/β fold of a canonical brct domain, with a core of four parallel β-strands, surrounded by α-helices . the closest structural homolog based on a dali analysis  <cit>  is the sixth brct domain of topbp <dig>   <cit>  . parp- <dig> brct and topbp <dig> brct <dig>  have a backbone rmsd of  <dig>  Å and also share 22% and 64% amino acid identity and similarity, respectively. interestingly, topbp <dig> brct <dig> also interacts with parp- <dig> and is itself a target of parp- <dig> mediated adp ribosylation  <cit> , although no par binding to this domain could be detected in these previous studies. similarly, in our studies no mono- or poly-adp ribosylation of the isolated parp- <dig> brct construct could be detected , consistent with adp-ribosylation occurring in the region adjacent to the c-terminus of the brct domain  <cit> . although topbp <dig> contains a degenerate phosphopeptide binding pocket, leung et al. reported that the isolated topbp <dig> brct domain does not appear to independently bind phosphopeptides  <cit> . a structural comparison of the binding pocket region of the first brca <dig> brct domain  with the corresponding region of the parp <dig> brct domain indicates that the parp <dig> domain would be even less likely to interact with phosphorylated peptides since the serine residue in the brca <dig> brct binding pocket is replaced by the leu <dig> sidechain in our structure . additionally, the parp- <dig> brct lacks residues consistent with either tandem or homodimeric brct interactions which characterize many members of this protein family .

CONCLUSIONS
the parp- <dig> brct domain plays an important role in the localization of xrcc <dig> and in-turn, the xrcc1-complexed dna repair factors, to sites of dna damage. in order to better understand these functions, we have determined the solution structure of the rat parp <dig> brct domain using both nmr and saxs approaches. we also performed studies designed to elucidate its interactions with the central brct domain  of the scaffolding protein xrcc <dig> 

it previously had been reported that under physiologically relevant conditions, the parp- <dig> brct domain is a homodimer  <cit> . in contrast with expectations, both the gel-filtration and the saxs studies reported here clearly indicate that this domain, even at high  concentrations, is monomeric. we postulate that the previous identification of parp- <dig> brct homodimers may have resulted from differences in the construct used in those experiments, which apparently terminated at residue glu <dig>  resulting in the loss of most of α-helix  <dig> and increased solvent exposure of many hydrophobic residues including leu <dig>  val <dig>  val <dig>  val <dig>  and phe <dig>  it is of interest that a homodimer was recently observed in the crystal structure of the parp- <dig> domain c  <cit> . in this structure, the domain c monomers were in an anti-parallel orientation, suggesting that no quaternary contacts between two d domains can be made in the context of the full-length protein. because the domain c homodimer was only observed in the crystalline state, rather than in solution, it is likely that additional segments of parp- <dig> may be required to form a biologically-relevant parp- <dig> homodimer. the parp- <dig> brct domain also does not contain any of the specific structural motifs associated with either phosphopeptide, tandem, or homodimeric interactions, and likely will interact with its binding partners in a unique brct interaction mode.

the scaffolding protein xrcc <dig> is preferentially localized to sites of dna damage when parp- <dig> auto-adp-ribosylation occurs  <cit> . the presence of xrcc <dig> results in adp-ribosylation of xrcc <dig> and to a marked decrease in the catalytic activity of parp- <dig>  concomitant with the association of x1brcta and oligo-adp-ribosylated parp- <dig>  <cit> . it was unknown whether significant interaction between x1brct1a and parp- <dig> occurs in the absence of adp-ribosylated parp- <dig>  our gel-filtration studies of parp- <dig>  which could not have been adp-ribosylated because the constructs were bacterially expressed, do not detectably interact with x1brcta. this is in contrast to the observed association of these proteins when parp- <dig>  purified from mammalian cell culture, is oligo-adp-ribosylated  <cit> . based upon the current experiments and the studies of masson et al.  <cit> , the adp-ribosylation of parp- <dig> serves as a specific signal for association with xrcc <dig>  and in-turn the recruitment of attached dna repair proteins to sites of dna damage.

in addition to the reported interactions of the parp brct domain with xrcc <dig>  studies demonstrating the interaction of the parp brct domain with hsp <dig>  <cit>  and with nucleophosmin/b <dig>  <cit>  have also been reported. further studies are in progress to evaluate these possibilities.
