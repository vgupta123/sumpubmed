BACKGROUND
the primary goal of most, if not all, genome sequence projects is to elucidate the gene, and hence protein, content of the organism. the gene set is the key tool to elucidate the interesting biological aspects of the organism. the prediction of genes from assembled genomic data has traditionally relied on two types of data; sequenced transcripts and homology to gene sequences in related organisms. based on these data, various in silico methods to predict gene models can be applied. experience in intensively studied model organisms suggests that such methods still struggle to provide a reliable gene set. as more and more genome sequences of distantly related non-model species become available, the need for efficient, rapid and accurate methods of gene prediction becomes more and more pronounced.

just as gene sequences can predict protein sequences, protein sequences can predict gene sequences  <cit> . until recently, all methods to analyse peptide sequences in complex mixtures were too slow and too expensive to be considered a viable method of whole genome gene-model validation. transcriptomic methods have been core to gene prediction as they can efficiently identify transcribed regions and define intron-exon boundaries. proteomic methods focus on the translated regions of genes. they have been used to identify processed n and c termini of proteins and provide information about post-translational modifications  <cit> . proteomics has also been used to measure the quantity of each protein because this is only poorly predicted by the quantity of transcript  <cit> . proteomic analyses have hitherto been used to provide specific and complementary information about cellular function, but were not used as a primary method of gene annotation. recent developments in proteomic techniques, using liquid chromatography, have begun to challenge the speed, cost and efficiency of gene validation by transcriptomics. a number of recent studies have reported the use of lc-based high-throughput proteomics to assist in refining genome annotation  <cit> .

stagonospora  nodorum is a major fungal pathogen of wheat in many parts of the world, causing stagonospora nodorum blotch . in western australia it currently causes greater than $ <dig> m losses per annum corresponding to 9% of the yield  <cit> . it is a member of the class dothideomycetes, a taxon that includes many important crop pathogen genera such as leptosphaeria, mycosphaerella and pyrenophora  <cit> . a draft  <dig>  mbp genome assembly of a west australian isolate  was obtained in  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  sanger reads were obtained, corresponding to about 10× coverage. the reads were assembled into  <dig> contigs,  <dig> scaffolds and the mitochondrial genome. the total amount of gaps was estimated at  <dig> kb. a total of  <dig>  reads were not included in the assembly  <cit> .

the assembly was searched for genes using the broad annotation pipeline. the pipeline used the then available est data  and conserved homology. this predicted  <dig>  genes. this number was significantly higher than expected and so the annotation was checked by the acquisition of  <dig>  est sequences, principally from two libraries; an axenic library with oleate as carbon source and an in planta library made from heavily infected leaves with sporulating colonies. a total of  <dig> genes were manually annotated from comprehensive est evidence. a second gene prediction run using unveil predicted  <dig>  nuclear and  <dig> mitochondrial version  <dig>  genes  <cit> . one gene was present on the un-assembled reads. of the nuclear genes,  <dig> were supported by est data. a further  <dig> genes not supported by the second round of gene prediction were tentatively retained as version  <dig>  gene models.

this uncertainty in gene content was hampering research efforts particularly because, in this case, homology-based gene prediction methods were unreliable. s. nodorum was the first dothideomycete to be sequenced and the nearest sequenced relative organisms are separated by  <dig> mya  <cit> . a number of approaches to improving the confidence in gene models could be envisaged. in this study, we analysed soluble mycelial proteins using 2d lc-ms/ms to generate a library of mass spectra. the data were used to verify our current gene prediction models. in addition, we generated six-frame translations of the assembled and un-assembled genome sequences to facilitate the discovery of unidentified genes and correction of current coding exon boundaries and frame assignment. to our knowledge, this study is the first that describes the extensive use of high-throughput proteomics in assisting gene annotation of a phytopathogenic fungus. the data supports  <dig> genes, a number comparable to that supported by an extensive est project. it also highlighted many potential gene model problems and identified new gene candidates.

methods
growth and maintenance of stagonospora nodorum
s. nodorum sn <dig> and gna <dig> strains were maintained on czv8cs agar as previously described  <cit> . these two strains were chosen as part of a relative quantitation analysis coupled to this proteome mapping experiment. for proteomic analysis,  <dig> mg of fungal mycelia were inoculated into minimal medium broth supplemented with  <dig> mm glucose as the sole carbon source. the fungi were grown to a vegetative state by incubation at 22°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm for three days. vegetative mycelia were harvested via cheesecloth filtration and freeze-dried overnight.

protein extraction
soluble intracellular proteins were extracted from freeze-dried mycelia as previously described  <cit> . briefly, freeze-dried mycelia were mechanically broken with a cooled mortar and pestle and proteins were solubilised with  <dig> mm tris-cl . the crude homogenate was collected and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the resulting supernatant was retained and treated with nucleases to remove nucleic acids. all protein samples were checked via sds-page to ensure that proteolysis was minimal during sample preparation .

sample preparation
proteins from sn <dig> and gna1- <dig> strains were precipitated individually by adding five volumes of acetone, incubating for  <dig> hour at -20°c and pulse centrifuging for 5- <dig> seconds. the protein pellets were resuspended in  <dig>  m triethylammonium bicarbonate   before reduction and alkylation according to the itraq protocol . samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min at room temperature before the supernatant was removed and assayed for protein concentration . a total of  <dig> μg of each sample was digested overnight with  <dig>  μg trypsin at 37°c. each digest was desalted on a strata-x  <dig> μm polymeric reverse phase column  and dried. the entire experiment was performed in triplicate .

strong cation exchange chromatography
dried peptides were dissolved in  <dig> μl of 2% acetonitrile and  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid  and separated by strong cation exchange chromatography on an agilent  <dig> hplc system  using a polysulfoethyl column . peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer b . a total of  <dig> fractions were collected, pooled into  <dig> fractions, desalted, dried and resuspended in  <dig> μl of 2% acetonitrile and  <dig> % tfa.

reverse phase nano lc maldi-ms/ms
peptides were separated on a c <dig> pepmap <dig>   <dig> μm column  with a gradient of acetonitrile in  <dig> % formic acid using the ultimate  <dig> nano hplc system . the eluent was mixed with matrix solution  and spotted onto a  <dig> well opti-tof plate  using a probot micro fraction collector .

peptides were analysed on a  <dig> maldi-tof/tof mass spectrometer  operated in reflector positive mode. ms data were acquired over a mass range of 800- <dig> m/z and for each spectrum a total of  <dig> shots were accumulated. a job-wide interpretation method selected the  <dig> most intense precursor ions above a signal/noise ratio of  <dig> from each spectrum for ms/ms acquisition but only in the spot where their intensity was at its peak. ms/ms spectra were acquired with  <dig> laser shots per selected ion with a mass range of  <dig> to the precursor ion - <dig> 

data analysis
mass spectral data from all three biological replicates were combined and analysed using the mascot sequence matching software  with the support of the facilities at the australian proteomics computational facility . search parameters were: enzyme, trypsin; max missed cleavages, 1; fixed modifications, itraq4plex , itraq4plex, methylthio; variable modifications, oxidation; peptide tol,  <dig>  da; ms/ms tol,  <dig>  da. the mowse algorithm  of mascot was used to score the significance of peptide/protein matches with p <  <dig>  for each protein identification. four protein datasets were constructed for proteogenomic screening: the combination of version  <dig> and  <dig> proteins as defined from annotation of the sn <dig> genome sequence  <cit> ; a between-stop codon 6-frame translation of the s. nodorum genome assembly; 6-frame translated, cap3-generated  <cit>  contigs of un-assembled reads of the s. nodorum assembly, and; 6-frame translated singleton un-assembled reads which did not assemble into contigs via cap <dig>  all 6-frame open reading frames  were subject to a  <dig> amino acid minimum length threshold.

for the purpose of false discovery rate  calculation, randomised sequences from the version  <dig> and  <dig> proteins and the 6-frame translated assembly protein datasets were generated as mascot decoy databases  <cit>  .

characterisation of peptide-supported genes
peptide supported genes were analysed for abundance of assigned gene ontology  terms  <cit> . gene counts for go terms were compared between peptide supported and unsupported genes via fisher's exact test. a p-value threshold of  <dig>  was imposed to determine significance. gene counts for signalp  <cit>  and wolfpsort  <cit>  cellular location predictions and relative molecular mass predictions were also compared by this method.

de novo proteogenomics
mudpit-filtered peptide matches to the 6-frame translated assembly were mapped back to their genomic location. peptides mapping in the same orientation with either overlapping genomic coordinates or within the proximity of  <dig> bp were combined as peptide clusters . the purpose of peptide cluster formation was merely to reduce the redundancy in the peptide data to aid in the interpretation of subsequent comparisons with annotated gene features, therefore clusters with a single peptide were retained. individual peptides and peptide clusters were compared for overlap and proximity within  <dig> bp to s. nodorum version  <dig> and  <dig> genes.

potential homologs to s. nodorum sn <dig> genes were detected by tblastn comparison of the genome assembly with the proteomes of the dothideomycete fungi leptosphaeria maculans, pyrenophora tritici-repentis, cochliobolus heterostrophus, alternaria brassicicola, mycosphaerella graminicola and mycosphaerella fijiensis. tblastn high-scoring pairs  were grouped according to hit, but also subject to additional criteria: best hsp e-value < 1e-10; individual hsp e-values < 1e-5; hsps mapped on s. nodorum genome no further than  <dig> kb apart or split into sub-groups each subject to the previous criteria. grouped hsp sequence coordinates were compared to both peptide cluster and annotated gene coordinates on the s. nodorum genome assembly for overlap . by this method we detected peptide clusters which could be linked back to a nearby gene model through a shared homolog or peptide clusters representing potential new gene annotations with homology support.

RESULTS
gene models confirmed by mascot analysis of the existing gene model database
comparison of the detected peptides against a database built from both v <dig> and v <dig> predictions of sn <dig> genes matched a total of  <dig> gene sequences with high confidence . of these, all but  <dig> were v <dig> genes . the results indicate the greater reliability of the v <dig> prediction. the proteomic analysis matched  <dig> genes that were not directly supported by any of the  <dig>  est sequences . this clearly shows that proteomics targets a complementary set of gene products to transcriptomic approaches. the false discovery rate  for the mass spectra matched against s. nodorum proteins was determined to be 13% by the mascot decoy method. while this is relatively high, the purpose of this study was the discovery of genes not detectable by conventional techniques. hence we favoured sensitivity over accuracy.

1numbers of peptide supported genes in each category were compared to expected counts from a random sampling of the whole genome via fisher's exact test at a significance threshold of < <dig> .

the genes validated by the 2d-lc-ms/ms procedure were searched for features that were overrepresented compared to the total set of predicted genes. peptide-supported genes predicted by wolfpsort to be localised in the cytoplasm were over-represented whereas cytoskeletal, extracellular, mitochondrial, peroxisomal and plasma membrane samples were under-represented. peptides with predicted masses greater than  <dig> kda were over-represented. detailed analyses of go-terms over- and under-represented are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  these analyses are consistent with the source of the peptides used in this analysis in which only soluble, intracellular proteins were isolated and analysed. the data indicates that using extracellular, membrane and cell-wall material would significantly increase the number of proteins detected. if a similar proportion of protein detection was achieved for these proteins as was for the soluble, cytoplasmic proteins, the number of extra genes detected would be about  <dig> 

gene models confirmed by mascot analysis of the 6-frame translated genome database
the proteomic data can also be used to search for gene models with errors such as inaccurate exon-intron boundaries and missed or superfluous exons as well as entirely unsuspected genes. we approached this by mapping peptides onto the 6-frame translation of the nuclear genome assembly. the coordinates of overlapping or nearby mapped peptides were amalgamated into peptide clusters peptide clusters were defined so that internal gaps between constituent peptides of up to  <dig> bp were permitted, which is about four times the average intron size in s. nodorum  <cit> .

initially the mapped-peptides were compared to existing annotated coding exons . because of the uncertainty in defining the ends of exons, hits within  <dig> bp were also scrutinised. a total of  <dig> spectra mapped to the genome assembly. of these  <dig> mapped within coding exons,  <dig> mapped within  <dig> bp of a coding exon and  <dig> mapped distantly from known genes.

 <dig> cds features are coding exons . the number of proximal peptide and peptide cluster matches is greatly reduced in whole gene comparisons relative to cds matches, indicating significant mis-annotations in est-supported utr regions and/or intron regions.

a similar analysis was also carried out by comparing peptide clusters to the genome assembly . a total of  <dig> peptide clusters were analysed. of these,  <dig> mapped within coding exons,  <dig> mapped within  <dig> bp and  <dig> mapped distantly from known genes. the  <dig> confirmed peptide clusters correspond to  <dig> genes . of these,  <dig> were not identified by the previous mascot analysis of the gene models, bringing the total of confirmed genes to  <dig> . the genes identified by 6-frame analysis corresponded overwhelmingly to v <dig> genes. only  <dig> were v <dig> genes and  <dig> of these exhibited potential conflicts with the current gene model. all genes with est support had previously been designated v <dig>  in these cases, it was possible to define un-translated  regions, within both introns and terminal exons. the v <dig> confirmed genes included  <dig> without conflict and  <dig> with potential exon conflicts, divided between genes with  and without  est support.

1un-translated region /intron conflicts were determined based on peptide matches outside of coding exon regions but within either  <dig> bp or within the boundaries of known utrs. utrs were known for genes for which est alignments were available, where utr regions were defined as est-aligned regions not corresponding to coding exons or introns. 41% of peptide-supported version  <dig>  genes with utr regions confirmed by est support have suspected utr/intron conflicts .

these analyses so far have merely mapped 6-frame translated genome-mapped peptide or peptide cluster coordinates to exon or gene coordinates. next we considered the predicted open reading frames of the exons and the individual mapped peptides overlapping annotated coding exons . reassuringly,  <dig> peptides matched exactly to the predicted frame whereas  <dig> entirely matched to a different frame. when analysed by gene,  <dig> were fully confirmed; of these  <dig> were v <dig> genes and  <dig> were v <dig>  in a total of  <dig> genes, there were frame mismatches detected by all  or some  of the supporting peptides.

 the majority of peptide matches agree with current coding-exon frames, however there are  <dig>  gene annotations requiring frame reassessment.

gene models identified by mascot analysis of the  <dig> frame translated un-assembled read database
finally, the mass spectra were compared to the collection of un-assembled dna reads. the  <dig>  reads were re-assessed for overlapping sequence missed during the first genome assembly by clustering into contigs using cap <dig>  <cit> .  <dig> reads were clustered into  <dig> contigs, with  <dig>  singleton reads remaining.  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singleton dna reads matched peptides that were detected by ms.

sifting new and modified gene models by homology criteria
the probabilistic nature of the matching of the peptides to the genome is reflected in the false discovery rate, estimated at 13% for the matches against existing gene models. thus not all the gene confirmations, the conflicts with existing models or the potential new genes can be expected to survive scrutiny.

overall, these data suggest the confirmation of  <dig> previously defined v <dig> and v <dig> genes . of these, about  <dig>  are identified as having questionable exon boundaries and  <dig>  as having questionable frame assignments . confirmation or rejection of the new gene models will require gene-by-gene sifting of the evidence; however this analysis remains an effective method of highlighting gene annotations with potential problems.

analysis of the assembly identified a potential  <dig> peptide clusters that mapped distant from known genes and represent candidate novel genes. assessment of the unassembled reads identified a further  <dig>  candidate genes .

 <dig> peptide clusters were assessed for orientation conflicts with genes in the opposing strand and for overlap with grouped regions of tblastn homology to related dothideomycete genomes .

 <dig> reads that were not included in the main genome assembly of s. nodorum were re-assessed for overlap.  <dig> reads were clustered into  <dig> contigs, with  <dig> singleton reads remaining.

to sift through this large number of new gene candidates, we applied two tests. first we discarded gene candidates that mapped to known genes in the opposing orientation. this removed  <dig> of the  <dig> peptide clusters matching the assembly. as the genomes of several dothideomycetes have been released in the last three years, we were able to compare the predicted new genes to the predicted proteomes of these related organisms. overall 68%  of s. nodorum genes  genes) have a homolog among these related species. only  <dig> peptide clusters  corresponded to significant tblastn hits between dothideomycete proteins and the genome assembly. of these,  <dig> matched known s. nodorum genes  and six of these corresponded to a single gene . the three other peptide clusters correspond to potentially novel genes . in the case of the  <dig> candidate genes on the un-assembled reads,  <dig>  significantly matched via blastx to dothideomycete proteins of which  <dig>  hit existing s. nodorum genes. the remaining  <dig>  genes are dominated by transposon-related genes  but also include several metabolically and structurally critical gene functions .

CONCLUSIONS
the flood of genome sequences that are resulting from the wave of "next-generation" sequencing technologies demands the development of time and cost-efficient methods of genome annotation. annotation pipelines utilising transcriptomic data will remain the first choice option in many cases but the results presented here show that proteomics based on lc and tandem tof approaches can efficiently complement transcriptomic-based annotation. the number of genes confirmed by est analysis  and proteomics  are comparable both in terms of experimental time and equipment and consumables costs. the confirmation of existing gene models by proteomics is computationally straightforward as is the matching of spectra to 6-frame translated genome databases. merging and resolution of multiple datasets of differing evidence levels is more complicated. in this paper, we have developed an annotation protocol based on defining peptide clusters and comparing first their coordinates to existing genes and then their sequences to genes from related organisms. building upon this, we have created a pipeline that highlights potential problems with existing genes as well as new genes. this approach does not replace the need for manual annotation but reduces the scale of the task whilst providing an additional layer of evidence for gene annotation refinement.
