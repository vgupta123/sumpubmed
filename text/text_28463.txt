BACKGROUND
the generation of distinct populations of terminally differentiated, mature specialized cell types from multipotent stem cells, via progenitor cells, is characterized by a progressive restriction of differentiation potential that involves a tightly controlled, coordinated activation and repression of specific subsets of genes. this process depends on the orchestrated action of key regulatory transcription factors in combination with changes in epigenetic modifications that regulate which regions in the genome are accessible for transcription  <cit> . the more recently discovered family of micrornas  is thought to provide an additional layer of gene control that integrates with these transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory processes to further modulate the final gene expression profile of a specific cell type  <cit> .

micrornas  are a class of small, evolutionarily conserved non-coding rna molecules  involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing and as such play important roles in diverse biological processes such as developmental timing  <cit> , insulin secretion  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , oncogenesis  <cit>  and organ development  <cit> . mirnas are transcribed from the genome as long primary transcripts  encoding one or more mirnas, which are processed in the nucleus by the so-called ‘microprocessor’ complex consisting of dgcr <dig>  and the ribonuclease iii  enzyme drosha  <cit> . this liberates the precursor-mirna , a hairpin-type structure, which has a characteristic 3’ overhang of two nucleotides and is subsequently exported from the nucleus by exportin- <dig>  a ran gtpase protein  <cit> . inside the cytoplasm, the pre-mirna hairpin loop is removed by a second rnase iii enzyme, dicer, yielding a ~ <dig> nucleotide long imperfect rna duplex. this duplex contains two potentially functional mature mirnas termed the 5p and 3p strands, referring to which end of the pre-mirna they are derived from  <cit> . one of these strands is then incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex , which guides the mature mirna to its target mrna. in general, one strand is inserted into the risc complex at much higher efficiency than the other, whereby the strand choice may be based on a variety of factors including thermodynamic instability, strength of the base-pairing and position of the stem-loop  <cit> . the strand that is incorporated into risc with lowest efficiency is referred to with an asterisk  and, since non-incorporated strands are thought to be degraded, is less-abundant than its counterpart  <cit> .

the risc-incorporated mirna regulates gene expression through sequence-specific interactions with its target site, which is typically located within the 3’ untranslated region  of an mrna transcript. animal mirnas usually exhibit only partial complementarity to their mrna targets, whereby nucleotides 2– <dig> at the 5’ end of the mirna, referred to as the ‘seed region’, are thought to be the primary determinant of target specificity  <cit> . interaction of the mirna with its target mrna can interfere with protein translation and/or induce mrna degradation through a variety of different mechanisms  <cit> , thereby decreasing the protein output. the mechanism and level of effect are thought to be influenced by the degree of complementarity between the mirna and its mrna target, the surrounding sequences in the target 3’utr  <cit>  and their relative abundance  <cit> .

estimated numbers of mirna genes amount to nearly 1% of the number of predicted protein-coding genes in the genome of higher eukaryotes, a percentage similar to that of other large gene families with regulatory roles, such as the homeodomain transcription factor family  <cit> . in addition, mirnas are estimated to target the expression of approximately one-third of all mammalian genes  <cit> . due to the imperfect complementarity between a mirna and its target, most mirnas are predicted to be able to bind to and regulate a large number of different mrna targets  <cit> . in addition, multiple different mirnas can synergistically target and control a single mrna target  <cit> , providing the potential for complex regulatory networks. many mirnas studied so far are differentially expressed during development and differentiation, suggesting that each cell type might have its own unique mirna profile that could affect the utilization of thousands of mrnas and thus ‘micromanage’ the output of the transcriptome  <cit> . several studies have indeed provided examples of mirnas that play a role in the regulation of cellular differentiation, including hematopoietic cell differentiation  <cit> , adipogenesis  <cit> , osteogenesis  <cit>  and myogenesis  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that expression of only three mirnas  is sufficient to induce pluripotency in mouse cells, demonstrating that mirnas can act as major determinants of cell fate  <cit> . since mirnas have been discovered relatively recently, however, much still remains to be learned about their role in cellular programming, including the identification and detailed analysis of their targets.

in the present study, we took advantage of the robust and homogeneous differentiation characteristics of the mouse c2c <dig> myoblast cell line to investigate whether lineage-specific changes in mirna expression might underlie their terminal differentiation. c2c <dig> cells were originally derived from regenerating muscle tissue  <cit>  and are considered to represent the transit amplifying progenitor population that is derived from muscle satellite stem cells  <cit> . when cultured under low-serum conditions, c2c <dig> cells terminally differentiate and fuse into multi-nucleated myotubes upon reaching confluence, which is preceded by upregulation of the key myogenic transcription factors myod <dig> and myog. however, treatment of c2c <dig> cells with bone morphogenetic protein   <dig> induces these cells to differentiate into osteoblasts, which involves the upregulation of key osteogenic transcription factors dlx <dig>  sp <dig> and runx <dig> <cit> , subsequently leading to the expression of late osteoblast marker genes, such as alpl and bglap <cit> . these characteristics make c2c <dig> progenitor cells an excellent model system to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell-fate specification and terminal differentiation. using a previously generated rna polymerase ii  chip-on-chip dataset  <cit> , we show that several mirnas have differential pol-ii occupancy during c2c <dig> myogenic versus osteogenic differentiation and that overexpression of one of these mirnas, mir- <dig>  promotes bmp2-induced osteogenic differentiation of c2c <dig> cells.

RESULTS
c2c <dig> lineage-specific mirna expression
to identify mirnas that are differentially expressed during c2c <dig> myogenic versus bmp2-induced osteogenic differentiation, and thereby might play a role in lineage restriction, we made use of our previously generated pol-ii chip-on-chip dataset  <cit> . this dataset contains pol-ii occupancy data for undifferentiated c2c <dig> cells  and cells treated with  or without  bmp <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days, whereby changes in pol-ii occupancy are considered to reflect changes in transcriptional activity. since mirna genes are usually also regulated by pol-ii promoters  <cit> , this dataset formed a good starting point to search for lineage-specific mirna expression profiles. our selection criteria  thus led to the identification of  <dig> mirna genes, namely mir- <dig>  mir-34b/c, mir-99b, mir-365- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  located in the vicinity of enriched regions with differential pol-ii occupancy profiles during myogenic versus osteogenic differentiation within our dataset .

since most of these enriched pol-ii regions could alternatively be associated to other surrounding  genes, we subsequently validated whether the identified pol-ii occupancy profiles correspond to the actual expression profile of two of these mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  by quantitative pcr analysis of the mature mirnas . for mir- <dig>  the higher levels of pol-ii occupancy on the associated enriched region during myogenesis versus osteogenesis is reflected by higher levels of mature mirna expression. while pol-ii occupancy appears to be specifically downregulated during osteogenesis and does not change during myogenesis, however, mature mir- <dig> levels do not change during osteogenesis and are upregulated during myogenesis. for mir- <dig>  the associated pol-ii occupancy profile and the mature mirna expression pattern are very similar. these results confirm a lineage-specific difference in the expression of both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  given the high expression levels of mature mir- <dig> relative to mir- <dig>  we subsequently focused on this mirna to further investigate its potential role in c2c <dig> lineage-specific differentiation.

effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on genome-wide mrna expression levels
to gain more understanding of the role and putative target of mir- <dig> in c2c <dig> differentiation, we first created a stably transduced c2c <dig> cell line overexpressing mir- <dig>  and a control cell line transduced with the parent vector . we subsequently examined the effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on gene expression levels during c2c <dig> lineage-specific differentiation by means of genome-wide mrna profiling of undifferentiated  c2c12-pmirn <dig> and control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells and of both cell lines treated with or without bmp <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> days.

we first explored changes in gene expression levels during differentiation of the control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells. comparison of expression levels in differentiating cells  versus undifferentiated  cells in this control group revealed a significant upregulation of  <dig> probes during c2c12-pmirn <dig> treatment without bmp <dig>  functional gene annotation of this set of probes according to gene ontology  revealed significant enrichment of many go terms related to muscle development , consistent with an upregulation of the muscle transcription program under these culture conditions. this is illustrated by the expression profiles of several myogenic marker genes in our control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells .

similarly, we observed a significant upregulation of  <dig> probes during c2c12-pmirn <dig> treatment with bmp <dig>  as compared to undifferentiated  cells in the control group. functional gene annotation of these probes according to go  revealed significant enrichment of go terms related to bone development , consistent with the expected osteogenesis-inducing effect of bmp <dig> on our control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells. the expression profiles of several osteogenic marker genes are presented in additional file 1b.

finally, control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cultures treated both with and without bmp <dig> showed a clear cell cycle withdrawal signature as common functional gene annotation of the sets of probes significantly downregulated during myogenic  and osteogenic  differentiation. to illustrate, the expression profiles of several cell-cycle regulators are shown in additional file 1c.

we thus conclude that treatment of our control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells with and without bmp <dig> had induced the expected changes in transcription patterns corresponding to osteogenic and myogenic differentiation, respectively.

we next examined the effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on these gene expression profiles. mir- <dig> is expressed approximately 11-fold higher in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells than in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells at the d <dig> time point . similar to c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells, mir- <dig> expression increases during myogenic differentiation of c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells . while mir- <dig> levels remain higher in c2c12-pmirn <dig> versus c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells during myogenesis, the fold overexpression decreases to approximately 3-fold at d <dig> and 2-fold at d <dig> . the fold overexpression of mir- <dig> in c2c12-pmirn <dig> versus c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells also decreases to approximately 8-fold at d <dig> and 3-fold at d <dig> during bmp2-induced osteogenesis .

gene expression levels in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells were compared to those in control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells for each time point during each treatment separately. the venn diagrams in figure 2b-c, figure 3a and figure 4a demonstrate the number of probes found to be significantly higher- or lower expressed in the c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells versus c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells at each indicated time point during myogenesis  and osteogenesis . we subsequently focused on the sets of probes that are consistently expressed at either higher or lower levels at at least two consecutive time points during differentiation.

the venn diagram in figure 2c shows that during myogenic differentiation hardly any probes are consistently higher expressed in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells than in the c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells. however, we did observe a significantly lower expression of  <dig> probes at two or more consecutive time points . go-analysis of this set of probes  revealed a significant enrichment of go terms associated with various alternative differentiation pathways, including osteogenesis, blood vessel development, neuron differentiation and cartilage development. most of these genes are, however, upregulated during  myogenic differentiation, so they do not appear to be specific for a particular lineage. we did not observe any significant differences between c2c12-pmirn <dig> and c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells in the expression of muscle marker genes, such as for example the myogenic transcription factors myog and mef2c, ckm, chrng and the sarcomeric proteins actn <dig> and tnnc <dig> during myogenesis , suggesting that mir- <dig> overexpression does not have an effect on c2c <dig> muscle differentiation.

compared to myogenesis, many more probes are differentially expressed in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells versus c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells during osteogenic differentiation . we observed a consistent  lower expression of  <dig> probes  and higher expression of  <dig> probes  in the c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells. go-analysis showed that the set of lower expressed probes was significantly enriched for numerous go terms associated with muscle differentiation , and includes genes such as the myogenic transcription factor myog and the sarcomeric proteins tnnt <dig> and actc <dig>  these genes, which are upregulated during  myogenesis, are downregulated during bmp2-induced osteogenesis of c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells, which is further enhanced in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells . besides terms associated with muscle differentiation, go-analysis also revealed significant enrichment of go terms associated with wnt signaling , which include genes for the wnt proteins wnt5a and wnt10a. in control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells, wnt10a is upregulated specifically during myogenesis, while wnt5a is upregulated specifically during bmp2-induced osteogenesis .

interestingly, go-analysis of the set of  <dig> probes that are consistently expressed higher in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells than in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells during bmp <dig> treatment revealed significant enrichment of go terms related to bone differentiation , and includes genes for the osteogenic transcription factors sp <dig> and dlx <dig> and other osteogenic marker genes such as alpl, vdr, col1a <dig>  pdgfra, fgfr <dig> and kazald <dig> . the higher expression of osteogenic marker genes in c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells versus control c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells suggests that overexpression of mir- <dig> has a positive effect on c2c <dig> bmp2-induced osteogenic differentiation.

putative mir- <dig> target selection and validation
while our mrna profiling analysis revealed that a large number of genes are affected by mir- <dig> overexpression, we expected the majority of these changes in expression to be the result of indirect, downstream events following the initial effect of mir- <dig> on its direct target. we therefore set out next to identify direct mir- <dig> target genes. given the general effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on osteogenesis, we hypothesized that mir- <dig> might target signaling pathways involved in the initial activation of the osteogenic transcription program. we therefore focused on genes that were downregulated by mir- <dig> overexpression early during bmp <dig> treatment  and had at least one predicted mir- <dig> target site in their 3’utr . from this group, we selected three candidate target genes that are known to play a role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation: the wnt signaling proteins wnt5a and wnt10a and the bmp-inhibitor grem <dig> .

to determine whether these candidates are indeed directly targeted by mir- <dig>  we used an in vitro luciferase reporter assay. reporter constructs containing the 3’utrs of wnt5a, wnt10a and grem <dig>  as well as a positive control containing the mir- <dig> target sequence, fused to a luciferase reporter gene were co-transfected into hek <dig> cells together with the mir- <dig> overexpression pmirn <dig> or control plasmid pmirn <dig> to examine changes in luciferase activity . overexpression of mir- <dig> significantly suppressed luciferase activity of the positive control, but had no significant effect on the 3’utr-luciferase reporter constructs . our selected candidates therefore do not appear to be direct targets of mir- <dig> 

effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on c2c <dig> differentiation
finally, we examined the overall effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on c2c <dig> myogenesis and osteogenesis by means of biochemical assays for differentiation markers. the effect on myogenic differentiation was assessed by comparing creatine kinase  activity in c2c12-pmirn <dig> and c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells after treatment with dm in the absence of bmp <dig> . consistent with the lack of effect on myogenic marker gene expression, no significant differences in ck activity were observed between the two cell lines, again indicating that overexpression of mir- <dig> does not affect c2c <dig> myogenesis.

the effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on osteogenesis was assessed by comparing alkaline phosphatase  activity in and calcium release by c2c12-pmirn <dig> and c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells after treatment with bmp <dig> . the results demonstrate both an increase in alp activity and a significant enhancement of calcium deposition by the c2c12-pmirn <dig> cells. in agreement with the higher expression levels of osteogenic marker genes observed in this cell-line, these results further indicate that overexpression of mir- <dig> enhances c2c <dig> bmp2-induced osteogenesis.

discussion
in this study we used a previously generated pol-ii chip-on-chip dataset to identify mirnas that are differentially expressed during c2c <dig> myogenic versus osteogenic differentiation and thus possibly play a role in lineage specification. overexpression of one of these mirnas, mir- <dig>  had no apparent effect on myogenesis while enhancing bmp2-induced osteogenesis, suggesting a positive role for this mirna in the osteogenic differentiation program.

our finding that mir- <dig> is strongly upregulated during c2c <dig> myogenic differentiation corresponds well to other reports demonstrating mir- <dig> upregulation during myogenesis and high levels of this mirna in skeletal muscle  <cit> . this upregulation of mature mir- <dig> matches an increase in pol-ii occupancy at a region located within the first intron of the ppargc1b gene, just upstream of the mir- <dig> gene. this pol-ii enriched area lies adjacent to an e-box containing myod-binding region previously shown to be important for mir- <dig> upregulation during myogenesis  <cit> . approximately a third of all mirna genes, including mir- <dig>  lie within introns of protein-coding genes. such intronic mirna genes are usually co-regulated with their host genes and subsequently processed to mature mirnas after splicing of the pre-messenger rnas  <cit> . however, the mrna expression profile of the mir- <dig> host gene, ppargc1b, as assessed by our microarray analysis, does not fully correspond to the mature mir- <dig> expression profile; while mir- <dig> is upregulated during myogenesis, ppargc1b mrna levels do not change . together with the increase in pol-ii and myod occupancy seen at sites within the first ppargc1b intron, this might suggest that mir- <dig> is regulated independently from ppargc1b and transcribed as an independent transcript, an interesting hypothesis that requires further study.

the upregulation of mir- <dig> specifically during c2c <dig> myogenic differentiation suggests a role for this mirna in this pathway. indeed, a study by gagan et al. has shown that mir- <dig> promotes c2c <dig> myogenesis by targeting msc , a repressor of myogenic differentiation that inhibits myod activity by binding to its co-activators or binding directly to myod target sequences  <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> has been shown to target mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  and bmp <dig>  which are relevant to myoblast proliferation and differentiation, respectively, in pigs  <cit> . similarly, mir- <dig> has also been shown to play a role in the repression of cardiac hypertrophy by targeting mapk <dig>  igf1r , grb <dig>  and ksr <dig> , components of the map kinase pathway, in rat cardiomyocytes  <cit> . in contrast, we did not observe any significant effect of overexpression of mir- <dig> on c2c <dig> myogenesis, as assessed by the expression of several myogenic marker genes and ck activity. the discrepancy with the work of gagan et al. might be attributed to a difference in levels of mir- <dig> overexpression resulting from the use of different overexpression methods . alternatively, since the positive effects on myogenesis seen by gagan et al. were at early time points , it is possible that overexpression of mir- <dig> merely accelerates myogenesis and similar maximal levels have been reached by both mir- <dig> overexpressing and control cells at the later time points that we investigated . our observation that mir- <dig> overexpression has no apparent effect on myogenesis does not rule out that it plays a role in this process; most likely, endogenous levels of this mirna are sufficient for its biological function, and overexpression has no additional effect on myogenic markers.

it would, however, still be interesting to take a closer look at the genes that are downregulated by mir- <dig> overexpression in undifferentiated myoblasts ; genes that are downregulated during c2c <dig> myogenesis, and significantly downregulated by mir- <dig> overexpression in myoblasts, such as for example  fgf <dig> , crlf <dig> , ereg  and cck , are potential targets of this mirna and interesting candidates for further study on the role of mir- <dig> in myogenesis. unfortunately, we did not observe a significant effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on mrna levels of its published targets msc, mapk <dig>  igf1r, grb <dig> and ksr <dig> <cit> . this does not contradict the findings in these publications, since it is possible that mir- <dig> exerts its effect on these targets at the level of protein translation and not by inducing mrna degradation .

besides its putative role in myogenesis, we clearly demonstrate an effect of mir- <dig> on c2c <dig> bone differentiation. our observation that mir- <dig> overexpression promotes c2c <dig> osteogenesis in the presence of bmp <dig>  as assessed by alp activity, calcium deposition and expression of osteogenic marker genes, was surprising considering the lack of changes in its expression level during bmp2-induced osteogenic differentiation. since this effect of mir- <dig> overexpression is limited only to bmp2-treated cells, we believe that mir- <dig> on its own is not a major determinant of the osteogenic cell fate, but more likely plays a role in fine-tuning osteogenic gene expression within the bmp2-induced cellular environment.

a role for mir- <dig> in modulating osteogenic differentiation has previously been described by kahai et al. in the context of a nephronectin -3’utr overexpressing mc3t3-e <dig> osteo-progenitor cell line  <cit> . npnt is an extracellular matrix protein that, when overexpressed, enhances mc3t3-e <dig> osteoblast differentiation. npnt secretion depends on its glycosylation by glycosylation-associated enzymes including galnt <dig> . the 3’utr of both npnt and galnt <dig> contain a mir- <dig> binding site. kahai et al. demonstrated that, during late stages of mc3t3-e <dig> development , stable cell lines overexpressing npnt containing its 3’utr  have a higher rate of osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation than cell lines overexpressing npnt without its 3’utr; this is further enhanced by co-transfection with mir- <dig>  interestingly, co-transfection of npnt-3’utr with mir- <dig> enhanced production of npnt and promoted npnt glycosylation. it was suggested that interaction of the npnt 3’utr with mir- <dig> sequestered this mirna away from galnt <dig>  leading to enhanced galnt <dig> activity, a subsequent increase in npnt glycosylation and secretion and, as a result, a higher rate of osteogenesis. in addition, it was proposed that binding of mir- <dig> to the npnt 3’utr resulted in preventing access of other mirnas, thereby protecting the npnt mrna from post-transcriptional regulation and resulting in the observed increase in npnt synthesis  <cit> . in line with these findings, we observed significantly higher levels of npnt mrna in our c2c12-pmirn <dig> versus control cells after  <dig> days of osteogenic differentiation . it would therefore be interesting to determine whether a similar npnt/galnt <dig> –mediated mechanism might also play a role in the effect mir- <dig> overexpression has on bmp2-induced c2c <dig> osteogenesis. however, the positive effect of mir- <dig> overexpression on mc3t3-e <dig> osteoblast differentiation described by kahai et al. was only observed when co-transfected with npnt-3’utr and only during later stages of development. in fact, stable transfection of mc3t3-e <dig> cells with mir- <dig> alone actually inhibited osteogenesis  <cit> . this is in direct contrast with our observation in bmp2-induced c2c <dig> cells and indicates that the effect of mir- <dig> may depend on the osteogenic model system used and/or the signaling pathways involved in inducing differentiation: for example, it is conceivable that mir- <dig> acts specifically on the bmp <dig> signaling pathway to positively reinforce the bmp <dig> effect on our c2c <dig> model system, while this mechanism might not play a role in the differentiation of mc3t3-e <dig> cells by kahai et al., which occurred in the absence of bmp <dig>  further exploration of the mechanism underlying the positive effect of mir- <dig> on our bmp2-induced c2c <dig> system may help shed light on this issue.

we were as yet unable to identify the genes that are directly targeted by mir- <dig> during bmp2-induced c2c <dig> osteogenesis. most effects seen in our mrna microarray analysis are likely to be secondary to the initial effect of mir- <dig>  making it difficult to identify its direct target. given the overall positive effect of mir- <dig> on the expression of osteogenic markers, and negative effect on myogenic markers, we expected the initial targeting event to take place early during the differentiation process. to identify direct mir- <dig> targets, we therefore selected genes a) that were downregulated by mir- <dig> overexpression early  and consistently during osteogenesis, b) that contained a predicted mir- <dig> target site in their 3’utr and c) that were known to play a role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. this led to the selection of grem <dig>  wnt5a and wnt10a as putative targets. grem <dig> is a secreted glycoprotein that binds bmp <dig> and prevents bmp <dig> signaling and activity in cells of the osteoblast lineage  <cit> . targeting of grem <dig> by mir- <dig> could thus increase the levels of bmp <dig> available for inducing osteogenesis. wnts are a family of  <dig> secreted glycoproteins that activate their cell surface receptors to induce specific intracellular signaling cascades controlling gene expression and play a critical role in embryonic development, postnatal development and adult tissue homeostasis  <cit> . wnt signaling regulates cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis through β-catenin-dependent canonical and β-catenin-independent non-canonical pathways and has been shown to play an important role in bone formation  <cit> . wnt5a has been found to be the most dominant wnt expressed during osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells  both in vitro and in vivo <cit>  and wnt5a signaling has been shown to be important for bmp2-mediated osteogenesis in mc3t3-e <dig> cells, though the exact signaling pathways involved remain unclear  <cit> . wnt10a has also been shown to stimulate osteogenesis  <cit> . given their important role in osteoblast formation, it was interesting to determine whether these wnts were indeed targeted by mir- <dig> and subsequently how this could relate to the observed increase in osteogenic differentiation. however, our luciferase-reporter assay demonstrated that mir- <dig> did not directly target the 3’utr of any of these selected candidates and further work is thus required to identify the mechanism by which mir- <dig> exerts its effect.

the imperfect complementarity that may exist between a mirna and its target, the possibility for combinatorial regulation that depends on the presence of other mirnas to observe an effect, and the various mechanisms by which mirnas may act, pose a great challenge common to all studies of mirna function. in our approach we assumed that mir- <dig> exerts its effect by mrna destabilization and/or degradation, resulting in a decrease in mrna levels of its target. it is possible, however, for a mirna to have only very subtle effects on  targets that cannot be observed as a change in mrna levels of its direct targets, or to affect protein translation without affecting mrna levels  <cit> . in addition, mirnas have been shown to be able to affect mrna levels of their target genes via alternative mechanisms than binding to their 3’utr, which would not be detected using a luciferase-3’utr reporter assay. for instance, it has been shown that mirnas can affect gene transcription by inducing histone modifications at target promoter sites  <cit> . interestingly, a study by gerin et al. has shown that mir- <dig> can specifically increase the transcriptional activity of cebpa and cebpb  on adipocyte gene promoters, though it could not be excluded that this was an indirect effect through e.g. inhibition of a co-repressor  <cit> . given the role of cebpb in synergizing with runx <dig> to regulate bone-specific gene expression  <cit> , it would be very interesting to investigate whether a similar mechanism underlies the effect of mir- <dig> on bmp2-induced osteogenesis.

so far, we have attributed the effects seen in c2c <dig> cells transduced with the mir- <dig> precursor expression construct to mature mir- <dig>  the 3p strand of the precursor mirna. however, it should be noted that these cells also overexpress mir-378*, the less-abundant 5p strand. although present at 10– <dig> times lower levels than mir- <dig> , it cannot be excluded that the effects seen are  the result of mir-378* overexpression, and it would thus be interesting to also search for putative mir-378* targets within the group of affected genes.

in this study, we used our previous pol-ii chip-on-chip dataset to identify lineage-specific mirna expression. since the probes on the arrays used for this dataset were restricted to promoter sequences of protein coding genes, the results of this approach do not represent the full picture of pol-ii occupancy at all mirna gene promoters in the genome. this could explain why several mirnas known to be specifically upregulated during myogenesis, the so-called myomirs   <cit> , were not identified. however, our approach did provide a first means to identify several mirnas with differential pol-ii occupancy during myogenic versus osteogenic differentiation. most of these mirnas, including mir- <dig>  mir-34b/c, mir-99b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  have an as yet unknown role in these differentiation pathways and are thus attractive candidates for further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we have identified a list of mirnas that potentially play a role in c2c <dig> lineage specification and demonstrated a previously unknown role for mir- <dig> in enhancing bmp2-induced osteogenic differentiation. future studies will focus on further exploring the precise function of these mirnas during cellular differentiation, including the challenging task of identifying their targets and mechanisms of action.
