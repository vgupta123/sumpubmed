BACKGROUND
rice  is a major staple food and is consumed by nearly half the world's population. it accounts for more than 21% of global human per capita energy and 15% of per capita protein. in the past few decades, although rice production has doubled due to the introduction of high yielding varieties/hybrids and improved cultivation practices, it is still insufficient to cope with ever-increasing global demand, which is expected to increase at the rate of about 1% per annum  <cit> . at the same time, inappropriate natural resource use, along with biotic and abiotic stress pressure, is casting a shadow on rice production  <cit> . access to the rice genome sequence will enable identification of genes responsible for traits and alleles that will be essential to meet the growing demands of food production in the coming years. towards this end, whole-genome shotgun-based draft sequences of the indica and japonica subspecies of rice were reported previously  <cit>  while the international rice genome sequencing project , using a clone-by-clone approach, focused on generating a high quality, finished sequence of the rice genome  <cit> . indeed, access to the rice genome has served as a catalyst for investigations on comparative genomics, functional genomics, map-based gene cloning and molecular breeding in rice  <cit> .

rice is one of the cereals in the poaceae family, which collectively provides the largest source of calories for human consumption. within the cereals are larger genome species such as maize, wheat, millet and sorghum  <cit> . synteny in the cereals has been reported previously using molecular markers  <cit>  and recently at a higher resolution using sequences available from the rice, sorghum, maize, and wheat genomes  <cit> . thus, access to a complete, high-resolution rice genome sequence will facilitate research on other cereals with larger, partially sequenced genomes.

one of the emerging features of plant genomes appears to be the recent generation of gene copies that have diverged in regulation and function  <cit> . a common pathway for such a mechanism in plants is whole-genome duplication , which occurred for instance in maize as little as  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . other mechanisms involve tandem gene amplifications and segmental duplications. in rice, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> provide such an example. in addition, several genes of agronomic importance, such as blast, bacterial blight, virus and insect resistance, photoperiod-sensitive male-sterility as well as salt tolerance, have been mapped on these two chromosomes  <cit> . here, we report the in-depth analysis of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of a japonica cultivar of rice with genetic lengths estimated to be  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively  <cit> . we have generated high-quality finished sequences for these two chromosomes, annotated the chromosomes for genes and other features, and used these data to examine novel features such as the organization of disease resistance genes. we also asked whether chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are likely to have resulted from a wgd event by examining duplication events between the two chromosomes through alignments of mapped genes of wheat along the rice chromosomes.

RESULTS
general features of chromosomes  <dig> and 12
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> bac/pac clones were sequenced from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. chromosome  <dig> is slightly longer than chromosome  <dig>  with  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively, of sequence identified for them . excluding the telomeres, a few physical gaps remain on the two pseudomolecules; six and one on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . this was due to a difficulty in obtaining clones that span these regions, especially the centromeres and telomeres, which present technical challenges in sequencing highly repetitive tracts of the genome.

a total number of genes includes the te-related genes and the non-te-related genes.

b gene density is reported for all genes and non-te-related genes .

c average length of the genes is determined using the length of from the start codon to stop codon of the longest isoform.

of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes identified on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  could be annotated as non-transposable element related . a similar percentage of genes on the two chromosomes could be assigned a putative function or annotated as encoding an expressed protein, leaving a similar percentage annotated as encoding a hypothetical protein . with respect to domain composition, there was a striking difference in representation of some pfam domains between the chromosomes, suggesting the presence of genes coding for different suites of proteins on the two chromosomes. as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  there was a large enrichment of proteins on chromosome  <dig>  containing a leucine-rich repeat  domain, which is involved in protein-protein recognition and is a hallmark of disease resistance genes . besides the lrr-domain, there are two other domains common to disease resistance genes, protein kinase and nb-arc domains, which were also enriched on chromosome  <dig> relative to chromosome 12;  <dig> versus  <dig> proteins containing protein kinase domains and  <dig> versus  <dig> proteins with nb-arc domains on chromosome  <dig> versus  <dig>  respectively. based on alignments by a rice transcript,  <dig>   and  <dig>   of non-te-related genes on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were active . of these,  <dig> and  <dig> non-te-related genes from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, could be aligned with a fl-cdna. in addition,  <dig> non-te-related genes aligned with ests from other monocots on each chromosome. for  <dig> genes from chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> from chromosome  <dig>  only non-monocot evidence was available for expression . a ready set of mutants is available for  <dig> and  <dig> genes on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, as evidenced by a flanking sequence tag  in or within  <dig> bp of the transcription unit.

a similar fraction of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> could be classified as repetitive , which with the exception of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  were enriched in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of the two chromosomes . as noted previously  <cit> , mites, which constitute  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the repetitive sequences on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were enriched in the euchromatic arms of the two chromosomes .

a similar number of non-te-related proteins with putative homologs in model species were present in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . the highest number of putative homologs was seen in arabidopsis, with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the proteins from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, having a potential homolog in arabidopsis . similar ranges of potential homologs were seen between the two chromosomes and the other model organisms, ranging from 7– <dig> % in chromosome  <dig> and 10– <dig> % in chromosome  <dig> 

a high percentage of rice genes could be aligned with genomic assemblies from two other cereals, maize and sorghum. of the  <dig>  maize assemblies with a best hit on rice chromosome  <dig> or  <dig>   <dig>  overlap with non-te-related genes while  <dig> overlap with te-related genes . the remaining  <dig> assemblies align to intergenic regions, which might include genes or tes that are degenerated and not recognized by our bioinformatics methods. interestingly, for sorghum, the occurrence of alignments was similar to maize except that there was a higher incidence of alignment to te or intergenic regions, which could be due the fact that the sorghum dataset includes only methyl-filtrated and not cot-enriched sequences  <cit> . the  <dig>  non-te-related genes that aligned to both maize and sorghum genomic assemblies suggest that these genes might predate the divergence of the panicoideae, estimated at  <dig> mya  <cit> .

disease resistance genes in rice chromosomes  <dig> and 12
disease resistance genes  conferring resistance to viral, bacterial, fungal and nematode pathogens have been grouped into five classes on the basis of their encoded protein products  <cit> . for instance, a genome-wide study identified such typical protein domains in the r-like genes of arabidopsis  <cit> . major classes of conserved domains include leucine zipper , coiled coil , nucleotide binding site , leucine-rich repeat , protein kinase, toll-il-ir homology region  and trans-membrane  as well as miscellaneous r-genes. apart from the genes containing these typical domains, one maize disease resistance gene, hm <dig>  encodes a reductase that detoxifies hc-toxin  <cit> . we analyzed the sequences of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> to identify the type and distribution of the disease resistance as well as downstream defense response genes . we identified  <dig> r-like gene models in chromosome  <dig> , which is  <dig> % of the total number of gene models predicted for this chromosome. of these,  <dig>  have homology to the nbs-lrr class of r-like genes and  <dig> show homology to the lrr-tm-like genes. the long arm of rice chromosome  <dig>  contains almost twice  the number of r-like genes compared to the short arm . we also identified  <dig> downstream defense response genes including glucanases, chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins. most of these r-like genes and defense response-like genes are present in large clusters of tandem arrays indicating their origin by duplication from a few ancestral genes . large clusters of genes  are present between positions 30– <dig> cm , 80– <dig> cm  and 110– <dig> cm  of chromosome  <dig>  respectively. nucleotide positions are based on the pseudomolecules of tigr release  <dig>  <cit> . a detailed depiction of duplicated genes in the interval 112– <dig> cm on chromosome  <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig> and a cladogram of these genes is shown in additional figure  <dig> , confirming that the genes within a cluster generally belong to the same clade. a tandem array of  <dig> xa21-like genes is present on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> cm , while the actual xa <dig> gene is present on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . a large cluster of  <dig> defense response genes,  <dig> of which are chitinases, is present in tandem at  <dig>  cm . several other r-like genes are also arranged in similar but small clusters.

on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> gene models showed homology to r-like genes , which is  <dig> % of the total number of gene models predicted for this chromosome. however,  <dig> of these  <dig> gene models belonged to the miscellaneous category including viral resistance, verticillium wilt resistance, blb resistance genes and those containing lrr motif but without nbs, cc or lz motifs. on chromosome  <dig>  only  <dig> gene models showed homology to the nbs-lrr category. although the r-like genes and defense response genes were distributed throughout the chromosome, they were present in clusters . a large cluster of  <dig> miscellaneous resistance genes was found between positions 40– <dig> cm  and a cluster of seven defense response genes was found at position  <dig>  cm . the previously described blast resistance gene pita  <cit>  was present near the centromere of chromosome  <dig>  the total number of r-like genes in chromosome  <dig> was less than half of the number in chromosome  <dig>  even though the size and total number of genes in these two chromosomes are similar. this can be attributed to the enrichment of nbs-lrr, lz-nbs-lrr and lrr-tm-like genes in chromosome  <dig>  which was 3– <dig> times higher than chromosome  <dig> . the difference in the number of r-like genes between the two chromosomes also has an impact on the extent of tandem gene arrays. chromosome  <dig> has a total of  <dig> genes  and chromosome  <dig> has  <dig> genes  that are duplicated at least once within a short distance .

a previous report on the analysis of r-like genes in the entire rice genome revealed that most of the r-like genes  are present on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . another report found more than 25% of the physically mapped nbs-encoding genes on chromosome  <dig> and claimed that approximately 20% of the nbs-lrr genes in the nipponbare genome were predicted to be pseudogenes  <cit> . comparison of the total number of genes containing the lrr domain  in the finished genome sequence  <cit>  with the number of such genes on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the present study  shows a similar percentage  of r-like genes to be on these two chromosomes. however, the previous total estimate of  <dig> r-like genes is significantly lower than the one from the finished genome , indicating that previous draft sequences did not provide sufficient information for capturing all candidate genes for disease resistance and, in addition, that gene finding methods are not directly comparable. complete sequence information is also important for accurate sequence alignments of r-like genes with cloned disease resistance genes from rice  arabidopsis , tomato, , barley  and wheat . the r-like gene and defense response gene hot spots in these two chromosomes will be invaluable for future mapping and cloning of disease resistance genes from naturally occurring disease resistant rice lines. however, manual re-annotation of these r-like genes, as done in case of arabidopsis  <cit> , and functional validation of the candidate resistance genes, would be important for drawing practical benefits from this information.

recent duplication on chromosomes  <dig> and 12
chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> harbor duplicated regions at the distal ends of their short arms as determined by physical and genetic mapping  <cit> . based on previous versions of the rice genome sequence, it became evident that segmental duplications occur throughout the genome  <cit> . here, we focused on segmental duplications between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> only because the finished sequences of these chromosomes permit us to conduct an analysis of the organization of their genes in a detail that was not possible before. at ≥50% coverage and ≥80% identity and excluding te-related gene models,  <dig> gene models were identified as duplicated. a subset of these,  <dig> from chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> from chromosome  <dig>  was found to be unique between these chromosomes, excluding repeated gene models. based on the chromosomal locations of these unique genes, the maximum extent of duplication was confined within the first  <dig> mb of both chromosomes . possibly, there could be a difference between japonica and indica varieties, as previous comparisons identified a second duplication between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in the indica  <cit>  but not the japonica  <cit>  species. here, most of the duplicated gene models  were found in the same orientation on both the chromosomes . the  <dig> mb region was further analyzed to find the number of duplicated genes at ≥ <dig>  ≥ <dig>  ≥ <dig>  ≥ <dig>  ≥ <dig>  ≥ <dig> and ≥90% coverage. the numbers of duplicated genes at ≥30% coverage for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig>  while at ≥90% coverage, the numbers of duplicated genes were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . using alignment to ests and fl-cdnas, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models were expressed; of these, a total of  <dig> expressed gene models were common to both chromosomes. interestingly,  <dig> and  <dig> gene models were expressed but their homoeologous copies on the respective chromosome were not expressed . although it is possible that all ests or cdnas are not represented in the database, it may be that variation in expression reflects diverged expression of one of the homoeologous copies. divergence of regulation of gene expression after gene amplification has also been reported in maize  <cit> .

to determine the time of the segmental duplication, the full-length coding regions of a subset of homoeologous genes that had been genetically mapped and were distributed over the entire length of the duplication were aligned and pair-wise analyzed for their nucleotide substitution rates . by applying a codon likelihood model, synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates were compared. the values for each gene pair varied 18-fold for ks and 556-fold for ka, indicating that divergence rates differed significantly among genes. we therefore applied the χ <dig> homogeneity test to the estimates of divergence time for the rice homoeologs  <cit> . the χ <dig> value was highly significant , implying that these linked genes diverged within the same time interval. based on the speciation of rice about  <dig> mya  <cit> , we calculate the average divergence time for the segmental duplication to be  <dig>  mya. we explain the difference from previously published estimates of  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit>  by the sequence accuracy of finished versus whole-genome shotgun sequences  <cit> .

the number of unique duplicated gene models for the remaining portion  of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, with a high degree of rearrangement. within this region, there were  <dig> and  <dig> gene models at ≥30% coverage, while at ≥90% coverage, there were only  <dig> genes for both the chromosomes . interestingly, only  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes  were found to be expressed based on homology to an est or cdna, in contrast to  <dig> and 58% in the first  <dig> mb region of both the chromosomes. out of these, nine expressed genes were common to both chromosomes. also, there were nine and five expressed genes of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> that had non-expressed counterparts. this analysis supports the view that the first  <dig> mb duplication of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> is of recent origin. however, the loss of order as well as the low percentage of expressed genes, on each chromosome or in duplicate gene pairs, does not support a duplication of the remaining regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  unless it is very ancient in origin and signatures of duplication have largely disappeared.

rice-wheat synteny
to investigate further whether rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were related to each other and arose by a wgd event, we compared each gene model predicted from these two chromosomes against  <dig>  wheat ests. comparison of bin-mapped wheat ests with earlier versions of rice genome sequence provided a glimpse of the structural similarities between these two important cereal genomes  <cit> . however, the present study involves comparative analysis of the finished version of rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which allowed a higher resolution analysis with wheat and a comparative analysis between rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  a gene-by-gene comparison of sequence homology of all the predicted rice gene models with the wheat ests revealed that  <dig>   and  <dig>   of the gene models in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, have significant homology with the wheat ests at a bit cut-off score of  <dig>  of these,  <dig> gene models  from chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> gene models  from chromosome  <dig> showed significant similarity with bin-mapped wheat est contigs, a number that is much larger than the levels reported earlier for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . a complete list of the matching genes along with their annotated functions is provided in additional tables  <dig> and  <dig> .

out of the  <dig> gene models from rice chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  mapped to single wheat homoeologous groups, with the maximum number  located on group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat. the distribution of rice genes that mapped to the wheat chromosome groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . the majority of rice chromosome  <dig> gene models mapped to group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat indicating their common origin. many of these genes were clustered in the distal region of the long arm of wheat chromosome 4a, but the same gene models mapped to the short arms of wheat chromosomes 4b and 4d, reflecting significant rearrangements and a dynamic state of gene organization in homoeologous chromosomes of wheat and rice chromosome  <dig>  similar to chromosome  <dig>  a high percentage of chromosome  <dig> gene models  mapped to single wheat homoeologous groups. of these, the maximum percentage  mapped to group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat whereas the remainder were distributed almost uniformly on the other six wheat homoeologous groups .

a comparative distribution of rice gene homologs from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> to the seven wheat homoeologous groups clearly indicates that the two rice chromosomes have different origins and, apart from the recent  <dig> mb duplication, there is not much in common between the two chromosomes. this contradicts earlier observations that the whole of the rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> may have evolved as a result of chromosome duplication via polyploidy about  <dig> mya, i.e. before the divergence of cereals  <cit> . furthermore, these results are also consistent with the alignment of the genetic maps of cereal genomes  <cit> , where rice aligns with two homoeologous regions of maize.

CONCLUSIONS
with the completion of the sequences of rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  we were able to identify  <dig> r-like and  <dig> defense response-like genes, accurately date a  <dig> mb recent duplication between the two chromosomes, and show significant synteny between these two chromosomes and wheat chromosome groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. rice chromosome  <dig> has several large clusters of fast evolving disease resistance and defense response genes that have originated by the process of tandem duplication and subsequent divergence under the selective pressure of rice pathogens. this sequence and annotation will be an essential resource for the engineering of rice for tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses to accommodate growing production needs.
