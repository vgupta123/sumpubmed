BACKGROUND
a small number of hematopoietic stem cells  are responsible for the continuous production of mature blood cells throughout life. this process is based on the capability of the hsc to replenish itself through a process called self-renewal  <cit> , and to differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages. consequently, analysis of the mechanisms underlying hsc self-renewal and differentiation is fundamental for understanding the maintenance of the normal hematopoietic system. at present, our knowledge of these processes on the molecular and cellular level is limited, since studies on hscs are hampered by their low abundance in hematopoietic organs and are thus difficult to access in sufficiently large quantities for direct studies. an increase in the number of hscs occurs under normal physiological conditions in the liver during embryonic development  <cit> , indicating that the microenvironment in the fetal liver efficiently promotes self-renewal of hscs. elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the expansion of the hematopoietic system during embryonic development might therefore offer insights into the mechanisms of self-renewal in the hematopoietic system.

the expansion of the hematopoietic system is intimately connected with the development of the liver, suggesting over-lapping molecular mechanisms of these processes. liver development in the mouse is initiated at embryonic day  <dig>  when a distinct region of the ventral foregut endoderm receives inductive signals from two adjacent tissues, the septum transversum mesenchyme and the pre-cardiac mesoderm . ventral foregut endodermal cells committed to hepatic fate proliferate and form a liver bud from which hepatoblasts migrate and intermingle with cells of the septum transversum mesenchyme. the mesenchymal cells originating from the septum transversum thereby contribute to the mesenchymal part of the liver, and development into a functional organ relies on continuous interactions between the mesenchymal and endodermal portions of the liver  <cit> . at e <dig> the liver has become a distinct organ with discernible lobes and is infiltrated by numerous hematopoietic cells and cells with hsc properties can be detected in the liver by e <dig>  <cit> .

members of the lim-homeodomain transcription factor family play critical roles during embryonic development in both vertebrates and invertebrates by controlling processes such as asymmetric cell division, tissue specification and differentiation of specific cell types . one member of this family, lhx <dig>  is of particular interest, based on its function in the development of several different tissues via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and regulation of stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . lhx <dig> is expressed in the liver-associated septum transversum mesenchyme that becomes an integral part of the liver and its expression is maintained during liver development until adult stage in hepatic stellate cells  <cit> . lhx2-/- embryos display a decreased size of the liver manifested already at e <dig> , suggesting that lhx <dig> is required for expansion of the fetal liver  <cit> . the mutant phenotype is due to the presence of activated hepatic stellate cells causing a fibrotic and disorganized liver containing phenotypically abnormal endodermal cells  <cit> . the mesenchymal defect in the liver of lhx2-/- mice cause a lethal anemia, which is cell non-autonomous since the lhx2-/- hematopoietic cells appears to be normal  <cit> , suggesting that the mutant microenvironment is unable to support hematopoietic development. these observations indicate that lhx <dig> expression in hepatic stellate cells is involved in mesenchymal-epithelial cell interactions important for liver expansion, organization, differentiation and formation of the hematopoietic microenvironment in the fetal liver.

to further elucidate the putative role of lhx <dig> in the hematopoietic system we ectopically expressed lhx <dig> in hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells derived from embryonic stem  cells differentiated in vitro and from adult bone marrow  cells. this approach allowed for the generation of immortalized multipotent and steel factor-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell  lines  <cit> . the hpc lines share several characteristics with normal hscs such as response to specific cytokines/growth factors, expression of transcription factors and interactions with stromal cells  <cit> . the pattern of cell surface markers expressed by hpc lines derived from es cells and adult bm is similar to that of early fetal and adult hscs, respectively. the hpc lines derived from adult bm can generate erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid cells following transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients, and can long-term engraft stem cell-deficient mice  <cit> . the cells engrafting the stem cell-deficient mice maintain high level of expression of lhx <dig> in vivo, which eventually leads to a chronic myeloproliferative disorder resembling human chronic myeloid leukemia  <cit> . thus, ectopic lhx <dig> expression in hematopoietic cells allows for the generation of hsc-like cell lines, and molecular analyses of these hsc-like cell lines would give information of the role of lhx2-induced self-renewal of hscs, and hence novel insights into stem cell physiology and pathology.

in order to elucidate the molecular basis of lhx2-induced self-renewal of hscs we generated hsc-like cell lines from es cells differentiated in vitro with lhx <dig> expression controlled by a tetracycline-responsive element, and hence dependent on the presence of the tetracycline-analogue doxycyclin  in the culture media  <cit> . these dox-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell  lines down-regulate lhx <dig> expression almost two orders of magnitude within  <dig> hrs after dox withdrawal, leading to rapid differentiation into various myeloid cell types. we used the doxhpc lines to analyse lhx <dig> function by comparing global gene expression in the presence of dox to different time points after dox withdrawal using cdna array technology. this approach identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed at all time points, and thus putatively involved in lhx <dig> function in stem cell self-renewal and / or differentiation, and during organ development.

RESULTS
generation of hpc lines from the es cells with inducible lhx <dig> expression
previously, when generating hpc lines, we used es cells transduced with retroviral vectors containing lhx <dig> cdna that were subsequently differentiated in vitro into embryoid bodies . the hpc lines were established by expanding progenitor cells expressing lhx <dig> present in colonies showing a distinct morphology that appeared in the clonal assays of eb cells  <cit> . a similar approach was used here, however, since we were unable to identify distinct colonies in the clonal assays containing dox ,  <dig> colonies generated in the factor combination supplemented with dox were randomly picked and expanded individually in medium containing sf, il- <dig> and dox. stable doxycyclin-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell  lines could be established from  <dig>  of these  <dig> colonies. the pattern of cell surface marker expression was similar to that previously reported for the hpc lines generated from day  <dig> ebs  <cit> , e.g. c-kit+/cd45+/cd41+/sca-1-/lin- . all doxhpc lines expressed lhx <dig> and transcription of lhx <dig> was efficiently down-regulated  within  <dig> hours after dox withdrawal and was undetectable after  <dig> hours . in the doxhpc <dig> line where gfp was linked to lhx <dig> expression, flow cytometry analyses revealed similar instantaneous and efficient down-regulation of gfp expression after dox withdrawal . rapid cellular changes appeared immediately after dox withdrawal with respect to differentiation status and fraction of apoptotic cells. the fraction of apoptotic cells increased from a background level of 5%  to a maximum of 35% five days after dox withdrawal. the fraction of apoptotic cells decreased thereafter to background level within ten days after dox withdrawal . under these culture conditions , differentiation into various myeloid cells such as neutrophilic granulocytes, macrophages and megakaryocytes, could usually be observed after 4â€“ <dig> days , with concomitant up-regulation of lineage specific cell surface markers . although the distribution of the various myeloid cells differed between different doxhpc lines after dox withdrawal, all doxhpc lines maintained in sf+il- <dig> without dox generated mast cells and beyond eight days this cell type dominated the cultures . immature hematopoietic progenitor cells can functionally interact with stromal cells in vitro by generating cobblestone areas  <cit>  in long-term bone marrow culture) and are referred to as cobblestone area forming cells   <cit> . we have previously shown that the hpc lines derived from es cells differentiated in vitro efficiently generated cobblestone areas when seeded onto stromal cells  <cit> . the doxhpc lines only formed cobblestone areas when seeded onto stromal cells in the presence of dox , whereas rapid differentiation into macrophages occurred in the absence of dox . thus, this is a reproducible and efficient system amenable for global gene expression analyses comparing lhx2+ stem cells to their immediate lhx2- progeny.

analysis of gene expression changes caused by down-regulation of lhx2
we used cdna microarray technology to investigate the genome-wide transcriptional effects of down-regulation of lhx <dig> expression in the doxhpc <dig> and doxhpc <dig> lines. gene expression at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after dox withdrawal were analysed to elucidate differential gene expression early after lhx <dig> down-regulation, but prior to the time point when the majority of the cells are committed myeloid cells. the hybridizations were carried out using the design depicted in figure 2a. the number of features that remained on each array after filtering was high  and the majority of the excluded features were removed by the first filtering step .

we used an empirical bayes moderated t-test to identify differential gene expression. genes with a false-discovery rate adjusted p-value lower than  <dig>  were considered differentially expressed. however, several of these showed small fold-changes, and therefore only genes with an absolute m-value higher than  <dig>   were included in further analysis. the results are summarized in table  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and figure  <dig> and 4a. complete results are available as supplementary data. comparison of the two independent cultures within each lhx2-expressing cell line at time-point  <dig>  indicated no differential expression . on the other hand, the comparison between doxhpc <dig> and doxhpc <dig> lines  indicated that a large number of genes differed in their expression levels . in total,  <dig> differentially expressed array probes were identified , which could be further divided into  <dig> probes  with higher expression in doxhpc <dig> and  <dig> probes  with higher expression in doxhpc <dig>  interestingly, the expression of lhx <dig> is  <dig> -fold higher in doxhpc <dig> as compared to doxhpc <dig>  which may at least partly explain the difference between the cell lines. to identify genes differentially expressed as a consequence of lhx <dig> down-regulation, we combined the data for doxhpc <dig> and doxhpc <dig> cell lines. this analysis revealed  <dig> probes  at  <dig> hours,  <dig> probes  at  <dig> hours and  <dig> probes  at  <dig> hours to be differentially expressed . a large proportion of these genes were differentially expressed at all three time-points . this shared set of  <dig> genes included  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes. the array data confirms the dox-dependent regulation of lhx <dig>  as lhx <dig> is the gene with the largest decrease in expression  after dox withdrawal . agreement in the m and p-values was observed in cases where several independent probes represented different regions of the same gene , further validating the accuracy of the method. differential expression of  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated selected genes was confirmed by using real-time pcr to compare gene expression in the doxhpc <dig> line in the presence of dox to three days after dox withdrawal .

twenty-six of the  <dig> probes that were differentially expressed at all three time points were not included in unigene build  <dig>  we used blast sequence similarity searches  <cit>  to annotate the corresponding ests and the results are provided in the . several of the unknowns map to either 5' or 3' utrs, but also partly to known genes such as wbscr <dig>  map3k <dig>  and eifay/eifax. also, one of the probes  has no matches in any public sequence repository. whether these transcripts correspond to novel genes or novel splice variants of already defined genes remains to be determined.

gene ontology functional analysis of differentially expressed genes
we used the gene ontology classification of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes for a two-step functional analysis to define the overall gene ontology category representation and to identify themes that were over-represented compared to the complete mouse transcriptome  <cit> . a gene ontology annotation was assigned to approximately 50% of the  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes. within the 'biological processes' branch of gene ontology, the largest groups that changed their expression upon lhx <dig> down-regulation were 'macromolecule metabolism' , 'signal transduction , 'cell growth and/or maintenance' , 'nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism'  and 'biosynthesis' . a complete listing, which also includes the 'molecular function' and 'cellular component' branches of the gene ontology classification, is available as supplementary data . the themes 'regulation of signal transduction', 'organogenesis' and 'cell death' were significantly over-represented among the down-regulated genes  . several metabolism-related genes were significantly enriched among the up-regulated genes , which was also evident when the data was analysed using the kegg metabolic pathways  <cit>  . of note is that ten genes encoding components of the glycolytic pathway, including a glucose transporter  and glycogen synthase, are among the genes up-regulated after dox withdrawal , suggesting that this metabolic pathway is important when stem cells are initiating differentiation.

comparison with hsc gene expression signatures
global gene expression in murine hscs has previously been studied using affymetrix arrays  <cit> . both studies analysed the transcriptome of hscs by comparing gene expression in stem cell-enriched populations to that of more differentiated cells . we compared the genes enriched in these hscs populations to our list of differentially expressed genes . in the comparison with the data from ivanova et al. , we divided their dataset into two groups; "hsc and early progenitor-enriched"  or "late progenitor and mature blood cell-enriched" . of our differentially expressed unigene transcripts  <dig> overlapped with those in the "hsc and early progenitor-enriched" transcripts and  <dig> overlapped with those in the "late progenitor and mature blood cell-enriched" transcripts . a majority  of the  <dig> unigene transcripts overlapping with the "hsc and early progenitor-enriched" signature were down-regulated after dox withdrawal, and a majority of the transcripts overlapping with the late progenitors  were up-regulated after dox withdrawal. the comparison between the hsc-enriched transcripts from the study by ramalho-santos et al.  and our set of differentially expressed transcripts showed an overlap of  <dig> genes. also in this comparison many transcripts  were found to be down-regulated after dox withdrawal . thirteen genes were found in common between all three studies .

collectively these results show that lhx <dig> expression partly maintains the hsc signature and hence, the doxhpc lines with inducible lhx <dig> expression is a relevant model system for normal hscs also at the level of global gene expression.

genes most affected by lhx <dig> expression
the fifty genes that show largest fold-change  after dox withdrawal are presented in table  <dig> and  <dig>  the list of down-regulated genes contains two members of the serpin family of protease inhibitors, serpina3g and serpina3n, where the former is the most highly differentially expressed gene. in general, serpins are involved in diverse processes such as coagulation, extra cellular matrix degradation, complement activation, fibrinolysis and apoptosis  <cit> . the expression pattern of serpina3n has not been well characterized, but expression of serpina3g is highly enriched in normal hscs  <cit> , and in the hematopoietic precursor cell line fdcp-mix  <cit> . the exact biological function of serpina3g is not known, but has been shown to involve inhibition of caspase-independent cell death  <cit> . this is in agreement with the observed increase in apoptosis after turning lhx <dig> expression off, which is also reflected by the observation that two pro-apoptotic genes, bnip <dig> and perp  <cit> , are among the  <dig> most up-regulated genes . over-expression of serpina3g in fdcp-mix cells caused delay in differentiation and increased clonogenic potential of these cells  <cit> , suggesting similar function in the lhx <dig> expressing hpc lines and normal hscs.

most genes encoding enzymes within the glycolytic pathway were up-regulated after lhx <dig> expression was turned off, but one highly differentially expressed gene within this pathway, bpgm , was an exception as it showed a decrease by 75%. this enzyme is known to be present in erythrocytes where it is involved in the reaction generating the metabolite  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate, which is important for the oxygen-hemoglobin interaction. however, bpgm is also expressed during early developmental stages   <cit> , suggesting that it may affect other cellular processes.

genes linked to both normal and abnormal hematopoietic progenitor cell function were identified among the top  <dig> most differentially expressed genes. for example, among the most down-regulated genes sox <dig> and plscr <dig> , have both been reported to be enriched in hscs  <cit> . although the normal function of sox <dig> in hscs is not known, over-expression of sox <dig> in mouse hscs has recently been shown to cause myeloid leukemia and sox <dig> is also a frequent insertional mutagenesis target in murine myeloid leukemias  <cit> . plscr1-deficient mice have no major hematopoietic defects, but plscr1-/- hematopoietic progenitor cells show decreased colony formation and impaired differentiation to neutrophils in response to steel factor and g-csf  <cit> . examples of the most up-regulated genes were ndrg <dig> , and ncf <dig> . up-regulation of these genes would be expected since the doxhpc lines under the culture conditions used herein differentiate towards both neutrophil and mast cell lineages, and these genes are linked to the development and/or function of these cell types  <cit> .

etv <dig> and csrp <dig> , which also showed significant decrease in expression after turning lhx <dig> expression off, have been implicated in mesenchyme-epithelia interactions during embryogenesis  <cit> , similar to lhx <dig>  interestingly, both csrp <dig> and lhx <dig> are specifically expressed in hepatic stellate cells of the liver  <cit> . chronic liver injury causes activation of hepatic stellate cells leading to hepatic fibrosis  <cit> , and both lhx <dig> and csrp <dig> have been negatively implicated in this process  <cit> , suggesting overlapping function of these genes also in non-hematopoietic cells. in this respect it is interesting to note that one of the top  <dig> up-regulated genes is p4ha <dig> , which encodes an enzyme important for post-translational modifications of collagen, leading to increased stability of collagen fibrils. expression of p4ha <dig> is also up-regulated in the fibrotic lhx2-/- fetal liver as compared to the normal fetal liver  <cit> . thus, analyses of differentially expressed genes identified in this hematopoietic-based system might also give insights into lhx <dig> function  in non-hematopoietic cells.

overlapping gene expression patterns in mouse embryos of lhx <dig> and genes down-regulated in doxhpc lines upon dox removal
lhx <dig> plays an important role during embryonic development in the formation of several different tissues via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and/or regulation of stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . we therefore wanted to elucidate whether any of the differentially expressed genes, particularly genes that were down-regulated upon dox withdrawal, also were expressed in tissues/organs where lhx <dig> is expressed during embryonic development. although we were comparing differential expression in hematopoietic cells,  <dig> of  <dig>  of the genes down-regulated after dox withdrawal that we have analysed thus far, nuak <dig>  tmem <dig>  etv <dig>  enc <dig>  csrp <dig>  and tgfb1i <dig> , showed partly over-lapping expression pattern with lhx <dig> in different tissues. lhx <dig> is expressed by cells in the liver, the hair follicles, the developing cerebral cortex of the forebrain and the olfactory epithelium, and examples of genes showing overlapping gene expression with lhx <dig> in two or more of these tissues are shown in figure  <dig>  tmem <dig> is expressed in all four tissues, nuak <dig> and enc <dig> are expressed in olfactory epithelium, hair follicles, cortex area of the forebrain but not within the liver lobes, whereas etv <dig> is expressed hair follicles, cortex area of the forebrain, weakly within the liver lobes but not in olfactory epithelium . these results suggest that the mechanism whereby lhx <dig> immortalizes hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells might partly overlap with the function of lhx <dig> in the development of a variety of organs.

discussion
we have generated hsc-like cell lines by differentiating es cells with inducible lhx <dig> expression in vitro. self-renewal of these doxhpc lines, is strictly dependent on lhx <dig> expression, since down-regulation of lhx <dig> expression leads to loss of cafcs and rapid and efficient differentiation into a variety of myeloid cells. to elucidate the putative function of lhx <dig> in stem cells, we used microarray technology to compare global gene expression in these cell lines in the presence of dox  to different time points after dox withdrawal . we identified  <dig> genes  that showed differential expression at all time points  after lhx <dig> expression was turned off. gene ontology classification revealed that genes related to 'regulation of signal transduction', 'organogenesis' and 'cell death' were over-represented among the down-regulated genes , and that metabolism-related genes were over-represented among the up-regulated genes .

we have previously shown that the hpc lines generated by lhx <dig> expression resemble normal hscs in many basic molecular, cellular and biochemical aspects  <cit> . moreover, the hpc lines derived from bone marrow that engrafted stem cell-deficient mice maintained lhx <dig> expression in vivo and caused myeloproliferation  <cit> . we therefore anticipated identifying genes involved in both physiological and pathological processes affecting hscs by analyses of global gene expression of the doxhpc lines. a comparison of the differentially expressed genes to previously defined hsc gene expression signatures revealed that a majority of the overlapping genes expressed in hsc-containing populations were those down-regulated after lhx <dig> expression was turned off. thus, although we have used a different microarray platform, the genes defined as stem cell-specific in our system , reveal a  <dig> and  <dig> % overlap with genes defined as hsc-specific in the two different stem cell databases, respectively . furthermore, thirteen of the  <dig> unigene clusters  defined as stem cell-specific in our study overlapped with both hsc databases . in interpreting the results from the comparison between our stem cell-specific genes and the hsc-enriched genes in ivanova et al.  <cit>  and ramalho-santos et al.  <cit> , it should be noted that the probes on the arrays in those studies only has an overlap in our array of  <dig> and 57%, respectively. the overlap from our model system for hscs could be further viewed in relation to a study showing that the overlap between three different hsc-specific datasets varied between  <dig> and  <dig> %  <cit> . it should be noted that, despite the fact that these studies were carried out using the same affymetrix genechips, identical analysis approaches and essentially the same cell populations, there is still considerable variability between the different hsc-specific datasets. moreover, a majority of the genes that were up-regulated after lhx <dig> expression was turned off were preferentially expressed in differentiated cell populations. these results suggest that there is molecular overlap in the self-renewal and differentiation process between the doxhpc lines and normal hscs also at global gene expression level. we could also identify genes linked to malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells and one such example is sox <dig>  which was recently shown to cause acute leukemia if over-expressed in hscs  <cit> . sox <dig> has also been identified as a frequent insertional mutagenesis target in murine myeloid leukemias  <cit> , further supporting a role of this gene in malignant transformation. since lhx <dig> is always integrated into the same position, close to the hprt <dig> gene in the doxhpc lines, expression of insertional mutagenesis target genes is not due to insertional mutation, as has been suggested for retroviral integration  <cit> , hence, these genes are more likely to be linked to lhx <dig> function and/or stem cell function. human chronic myeloid leukemia cells have been reported to express lhx <dig> although its function in the disease is not clear  <cit> . another gene down-regulated after lhx <dig> expression is turned off is prkd <dig> , which has also been shown to be a substrate for the bcr-abl fusion protein present in chronic myeloid leukemia cells  <cit> . these results reveal a putative functional link between lhx <dig> and the bcr-abl fusion protein. however, both sox <dig> and prkd <dig> have been shown to be preferentially expressed in hscs  <cit> , which suggests overlapping molecular mechanism regulating both hsc physiology and pathology. by using our inducible system it would be possible to dissect these processes on the molecular, cellular and biochemical level.

it has been suggested that the notch pathway and pathways activated by different morphogens such as wnt, bone morphogenetic proteins  and hedgehog, are important regulators of stem cell function  <cit> . we have previously shown that the lhx2-induced hpc lines self-renew by a cell nonautonomous mechanism  <cit> , and the anemia in lhx2-/- mouse embryos is due to a cell nonautonomous mechanism, suggesting that lhx <dig> regulates genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cell interactions  <cit> . however, we have not found any evidence for differential expression of major mediators of the notch or wnt pathways in the doxhpc lines after turning lhx <dig> expression off. although the microarrays we used do not contain all mediators of these pathways, the results suggest that the mechanism whereby lhx <dig> expression generates hpc lines is partly or completely independent of at least the wnt and notch pathways. we did find consistent down-regulated expression of the hedgehog receptor smo  after lhx <dig> expression was turned off , and smo has also been shown to be preferentially expressed in normal hscs   <cit> . however, expression of the ligands  was very low to undetectable by real-time pcr analyses of the cell lines . thus, the functional role, if any, of hedgehog signalling in these cells remains to be determined. furthermore, tsg , which is a soluble modulator of bmp-signalling, was identified among the genes down-regulated after lhx <dig> expression was turned off , and is also defined as an hsc-specific gene   <cit> . the functional relevance of this observation remains to be determined as tsg protein has been show to act as a bmp antagonist as well as a bmp agonist  <cit> .

lhx <dig> appears to play an important role during embryonic development in the formation of several different tissues via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and/or regulation of stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . one of our aims was therefore to identify gene directly or indirectly regulated by lhx <dig>  possibly providing insights into the function of lhx <dig> in these processes. a caveat to this assumption is that it is not known whether lhx <dig> functions as a transcriptional activator, repressor, or both. the only reported target genes putatively regulated by lhx <dig> in a direct manner are those encoding olfactory receptors  <cit>  and these receptors are not expressed in lhx2-/- olfactory epithelia  <cit> . these observations suggest that genes activated by lhx <dig> are down-regulated in lhx2-/- animals, and conversely, genes repressed by lhx <dig> are up-regulated in lhx2-/- animals. a putative example of the latter is p4ha <dig> as this gene was up-regulated after lhx <dig> is turned off in doxhpc lines, and the expression of this gene was also up-regulated in the liver of lhx2-/- embryos compared to wild type embryos  <cit> . although our analysis was made in hematopoietic cells, almost 50% of the genes analysed among those down-regulated after dox withdrawal , showed similar expression pattern as lhx <dig> in different non-hematopoietic organs/cells during embryonic development. preliminary data suggests, however, that several of these genes show maintained expression pattern in lhx2-/- embryos, suggesting that these genes are not direct transcriptional targets for lhx <dig>  a plausible explanation for this observation is that different genes exert their function via parallel pathways in the regulation, formation or differentiation of a certain tissue but are not dependent on each other for their expression in that particular tissue. an illustrative example of such parallel but equally important pathways during organ formation can be observed during eye development, where both lhx <dig> and pax <dig> null mutant  embryos show a developmental arrest at the optic vesicle stage  <cit> . however, the expression of these genes appear to be independent of each other since pax <dig> isexpressed in the arrested optic vesicle in the lhx2-/- embryos and lhx <dig> is expressed in the arrested optic vesicle in pax6-/- embryos  <cit> . whether the genes identified in this study play an equally important role as lhx <dig> in the development of the respective organ remains to be determined. our approach may therefore have identified both genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by lhx <dig>  and genes that play an important role together with lhx <dig> via parallel pathways but are independent of lhx <dig> expression, similar to the lhx2/pax <dig> example during eye formation. these results suggest that elucidation of lhx <dig> function in various organs would give further insights into lhx <dig> function in the doxhpc lines and hence both physiological and pathological processes regulating normal hscs. conversely, elucidation of lhx <dig> function in doxhpc would give insights into lhx <dig> function in various basic processes during embryonic development, such as mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and regulation of stem/progenitor cells in non-hematopoietic tissues. we are at present time exploring all alternatives of lhx <dig> function presented above.

CONCLUSIONS
expression of the lim-homeobox gene lhx <dig> in hematopoietic cells derived from both es cells differentiated in vitro and from bone marrow, allows for the generation of hsc-like cell lines. to address the molecular basis of lhx <dig> function, we have analysed global gene expression in hsc-like cell lines with inducible lhx <dig> expression. this approach identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes where  <dig>  were down-regulated and  <dig>  were up-regulated when lhx <dig> expression was turned off. the relevance of this model system for normal hsc function was revealed by that the majority of the differentially expressed genes overlapping with hsc-specific datasets were defined as stem cell-specific in our system, and the majority of the differentially expressed genes overlapping with more differentiated hematopoietic cell population were defined as differentiation- or commitment-specific in our system. moreover, gene expression analyses in various tissues during embryonic development of the down-regulated genes revealed that almost half of these genes showed overlapping expression patterns with lhx <dig>  suggesting a functional link to the development and regulation of various tissues and stem/progenitor cells. thus, this approach has identified genes putatively linked to self-renewal / differentiation of hscs, and function of lhx <dig> in organ development and stem / progenitor cells of non-hematopoietic origin.
