BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious gram-negative intracellular bacterium that causes the zoonosis q fever  <cit> . central to c. burnetii pathogenesis is the ability to proliferate within a parasitophorous vacuole  of macrophages that has characteristics of a large phagolysosome  <cit> . by unknown mechanisms, the pathogen can resist the degradative activities of the vacuole while exploiting the biochemical and biophysical properties of the pv to promote robust intracellular replication  <cit> .

the c. burnetii pv is a unique cellular compartment that can occupy nearly the entire host cell cytoplasm  <cit> . c. burnetii protein synthesis is required for pv interactions with a subset of cellular vesicles that contribute material to the growing vacuole  <cit> . a collection of effector proteins secreted directly into the cytosol by a specialized dot/icm type ivb secretion system are considered largely responsible for modulation of host cell functions that promote pv formation  <cit> , and dot/icm function is clearly necessary for productive infection  <cit> .

it is reasonable to suspect that modification of the pv microenvironment by additional secretion systems is also important in c. burnetii host cell parasitism. gram-negative bacteria can employ several secretion systems to translocate proteins into the extracellular milieu  <cit> . however, bioinformatic analysis of the c. burnetii genome reveals canonical components of only a type i secretion system with the presence of a tolc homolog  <cit> . type i secretion is typically a one step process that transports proteins directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the surrounding environment  <cit> . however, a small number of proteins, such as heat-stable enterotoxins i and ii of escherichia coli <cit> , and an ankyrin repeat protein of rickettsia typhi <cit> , appear to access tolc via the periplasm after transport across the inner membrane by the sec translocase. c. burnetii lacks typical constituents of a type ii secretion system  <cit> . however, the organism encodes several genes involved in type iv pili  assembly, several of which are homologous to counterparts of type ii secretion systems, indicating a common evolutionary origin and possibly a similar function  <cit> . accumulating data indicates core t4p proteins can constitute a secretion system  <cit> . in francisella novicida, a collection of t4p proteins form a secretion system that secretes at least  <dig> proteins  <cit> . in vibrio cholerae, t4p secrete a soluble colonization factor required for optimal intestinal colonization of infant mice  <cit> . dichelobacter nodosus secrete proteases in a t4p-dependent manner  <cit> .

like the well-studied type ii secretion system of legionella pneumophila, a close phylogenetic relative of c. burnetii <cit> , substrates secreted by t4p are biased towards n-terminal signal sequence-containing enzymes  <cit> . c. burnetii encodes several enzymes with predicted signal sequences, such as an acid phosphatase  that inhibits neutrophil nadph oxidase function and superoxide anion production  <cit> . along with pv detoxification, c. burnetii exoenzymes could presumably degrade macromolecules into simpler substrates that could then be transported by the organism’s numerous transporters  <cit> . genome analysis indicates c. burnetii possesses a complete sec translocase for translocation of signal sequence-containing proteins into the periplasm  <cit> .

another secretion mechanism employed by gram-negative bacteria is release of outer membrane vesicles . omvs capture periplasmic components before the vesicle pinches off from the cell envelope. this 'packaging’ of proteins is thought to provide a protective environment for delivery of the contents. omvs are implicated in a variety of functions including delivery of virulence factors, killing of competing bacteria, and suppression of host immune responses  <cit> .

the discovery of host cell-free growth of c. burnetii in acidified citrate cysteine medium   <cit>  allowed us to probe culture media for the presence of secreted proteins. mass spectrometry generated a list of  <dig> c. burnetii proteins in accm culture supernatants. immunoblotting of culture supernatants following growth of c. burnetii transformants expressing individual epitope-tagged versions of identified proteins confirmed secretion of  <dig> of these proteins. secretion of epitope-tagged proteins also occurred during growth of c. burnetii in vero host cells. an intact n-terminal signal sequence was required for secretion, indicating secreted proteins have a transient periplasmic location.

RESULTS
coxiella burnetii proteins are present in growth medium supernatant
the dot/icm type ivb secretion system of c. burnetii has been extensively studied  <cit> . however, little is known about other secretion systems of c. burnetii that are presumably important for intracellular parasitism. to determine if c. burnetii secretes proteins during axenic growth, bacteria were cultivated in accm- <dig> without neopeptone to eliminate media proteins. following 7 days of growth, supernatant was concentrated and analyzed by sds-page and silver staining . many proteins were detected, with the majority having a molecular weight below 20 kda. in a discovery experiment to generate a list of potentially secreted proteins to further investigate, sds-page was conducted again and proteins stained with coomassie g- <dig> to allow analysis by microcapillary reverse-phase hplc nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry . a list of  <dig> proteins was generated  with functions assigned based on the annotated genome of the c. burnetii nine mile rsa <dig> reference strain  <cit> . sixteen proteins were annotated as hypothetical exported proteins, which represents 36% of the total proteins with this annotation in the predicted c. burnetii proteome  <cit> . twenty-nine proteins, such as translation initiation factor  <dig>  and ribosomal protein subunit l31p , were predicted as cytoplasmic using the psortb v <dig> . <dig> bacterial protein subcellular localization prediction program  <cit> . this result could be explained by a small amount of bacterial lysis releasing abundant cytoplasmic proteins that are then detected by highly sensitive mass spectrometry. the only dot/icm type ivb secretion system substrate detected was cbu <dig>  <cit> . however, type ivb-dependent secretion of cbu <dig> was demonstrated using l. pneumophila as a surrogate host, and the protein contains a predicted signal sequence, which are typically not associated with dot/icm type ivb effectors  <cit> . thus, cbu <dig> may represent a false positive type ivb effector. nonetheless, the lack of identified c. burnetii dot/icm type ivb secretion system substrates in culture supernatants indicates secretion via this mechanism requires host cell-derived signals.

expression of epitope-tagged proteins by c. burnetii transformants confirms secretion
to confirm active secretion of proteins by c. burnetii into growth media, we generated  <dig> genetic transformants expressing individual proteins, under the control of an inducible teta promoter, that contain a c-terminal 3xflag-tag . proteins identified by mass spectometry were selected for epitope-tagging based on predictions obtained using psortb, tmhmm  <cit> , signalp  <dig>   <cit> , blast and pubmed bioinformatics tools. each protein was first analyzed by a blast search to identify potential homologs. if a homolog was identified, pubmed searches were conducted to determine if the function and/or the cellular location of the homolog had been characterized. the predicted cellular location was also obtained using psortb, tmhmm and signalp. based on these analyses, proteins that were unlikely to be secreted, such as malate dehydrogenase, were eliminated from further study.

expression of flag-tagged proteins by c. burnetii transformants was induced by addition of anhydrotetracycline  following 48 h of growth of individual transformants in accm- <dig>  c. burnetii and culture supernatants were harvested 24 h later. immunoblotting of culture supernatants with anti-flag antibody confirmed secretion of  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate proteins . flag-tag positive bands were not due to cell lysis as bands were not observed following probing of individual supernatants with antibody directed against ef-ts, an abundant cytoplasmic protein . to ensure negative secretion was not due to a lack of protein expression, bacterial pellets were also analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-flag antibody. with the exception of cbu0089a, cbu <dig>  cbu <dig>  and cbu <dig>  expression of all tagged proteins was confirmed .

accm- <dig> culture supernatants by flag-tag assay

all  <dig> secreted proteins contained a predicted signal peptide, with  <dig> annotated as hypothetical proteins . this is not surprising given the unique host-pathogen relationship of c. burnetii and the fact that  <dig> % of the open reading frames of the nine mile reference strain encode hypothetical proteins  <cit> . secretion of proteins annotated as enhanced entry proteins  was confirmed by the flag-tag assay. these proteins are homologous to l. pneumophila proteins originally thought to facilitate pathogen entry into host cells   <cit> . however, a more recent study of l. pneumophila enhc demonstrates a role for this protein in peptidoglycan remodeling  <cit> . secretion of com <dig> and fkpa  was confirmed, both of which also have homologs in l. pneumophila. little is known about their roles in c. burnetii pathogenesis, although com <dig> is known to be outer membrane associated  <cit>  and fkpa has peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase  activity  <cit> . the three remaining secreted proteins with predicted functions were arti , an arginine-binding protein, sodc , a cu-zn superoxide dismutase, and a m <dig> family peptidase .

c. burnetii secretes flag-tagged proteins during growth in host cells
we next examined whether proteins secreted by c. burnetii during axenic growth were also secreted during growth in mammalian host cells. vero cells were infected for 5 days with c. burnetii transformants expressing the flag-tagged secreted proteins cbu <dig>  cbu <dig> or cbu <dig>  atc was added to induce protein expression, then infected cells lysed 18 h later with  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  which solubilizes host cell membranes, but not c. burnetii <cit> . cell lysates were centrifuged, then the pellets  and supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting using α-flag and α-ef-ts antibodies . flag-tagged proteins were detected in the supernatant, indicating secretion occurs during host cell infection. flag-tagged proteins were also present in the bacterial pellet showing the rate of protein synthesis is greater than the rate of secretion. ef-ts was only detected in the pellet, thereby eliminating bacterial lysis as a source of flag-tagged protein in supernatants.

secretion of flag-tagged proteins requires an intact signal sequence
all verified secreted proteins contained a predicted n-terminal signal sequence. signal sequences direct transport of proteins across the inner membrane via the sec translocase  <cit> . to determine if transport to the periplasm was necessary for secretion, the secreted proteins cbu <dig>  cbu <dig>  cbu <dig>  cbu <dig> and cbu <dig> were expressed as before, but without their signal sequences. immunoblotting for c-terminal flag-tags revealed that each of the five proteins was present in cell pellets, but not culture supernatants . thus, a signal sequence, and therefore, a transient periplasmic location is necessary for secretion.

potential secretion mechanisms
c. burnetii sec-mediated secretion could occur by the mechanisms depicted in figure  <dig>  type i-like secretion is predicted by the presence of a tolc homolog  in the c. burnetii genome. genome analysis also makes t4p-mediated secretion conceivable as  <dig> t4p genes are present in the c. burnetii nine mile reference strain genome . eleven of these genes share homologs with the t4p genes of f. novicida, a bacterium that employs t4p-mediated secretion . however, we did not detect pili on the surface of c. burnetii using a procedure that visualized pili on f. tularensis lvs  <cit>  . omvs are produced by a large variety of microbes  <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts what appear to be c. burnetii omvs being produced by bacteria growing in media and within vero cells, suggesting omvs contribute to sec-mediated secretion of proteins by c. burnetii.

discussion
the importance of protein secretion for bacterial survival and virulence is well documented. therefore, it was not surprising to discover that c. burnetii secretes at least  <dig> proteins into growth media. this number is similar to the  <dig> proteins experimentally confirmed by the laboratory of n. p. cianciotto as secreted by the type ii secretion system of l. pneumophila, a close relative of c. burnetii <cit> . heterogeneity among genes encoding secreted proteins is observed between the nine mile strain genome used in this study, and the published genomes of the k , g , and dugway  strains. genes encoding cbu <dig> and cbu0562a are missing in k and g, respectively, and four genes are truncated as follows: cbu <dig> and cbu <dig> , cbu1429a , and cbu <dig> . all code for hypothetical proteins except cbu <dig>  which encodes sodc.

assigning functional roles to these proteins is difficult given the majority are annotated as hypothetical proteins. however, recently developed methods for deleting c. burnetii genes could prove useful in defining function  <cit> . of the few secreted proteins with predicted functions, sodc, arti, and an m <dig> family peptidase encoded by cbu <dig>  are of particular interest when considering the phagolysosomal characteristics of the c. burnetii pv. sodc is an important virulence factor of intracellular bacteria that degrades superoxide anion generated by the macrophage oxidative burst, thereby lowering oxidative stress  <cit> . the dugway isolate may compensate for the lack of sodc by producing a functional catalase, which the nile mile strain apparently lacks  <cit> . arti might compensate for c. burnetii arginine auxotrophy  <cit>  by high affinity binding of arginine in what might be a nutrient-limited pv environment. cbu <dig> shares homology with zn metalloendopeptidases, including pitrilysin, an e. coli peptidase that is capable of cleaving numerous substrates  <cit> . thus, cbu <dig> could modify the pv environment by cleaving harmful acid hydrolases or degrading complex proteinaceous material into peptides/amino acids suitable for transport by c. burnetii. proteins secreted by sec-mediated processes are clearly important for host cell modifications that benefit pathogen replication  <cit> . for example, francisella spp. secrete an acid phosphatase , both in vitro and ex vivo, that has been shown in macrophages to dephosphorylate components of the nadph oxidase system. this suppression of the oxidative burst promotes intracellular survival and subsequent replication of the pathogen  <cit> . interestingly, a similar scenario is invoked for the acid phosphatase of c. burnetii <cit> , although this protein was not among the  <dig> detected in growth media.

based on genomic and/or ultrastructural data, we propose three secretion mechanisms/protein complexes that may contribute to sec-mediated secretion by c. burnetii. first, the presence of several t4p genes organized in predicted operons suggests secretion might occur via a cell envelope-spanning complex comprised of t4p proteins. however, we found no evidence of pili-like structures on the surface of c. burnetii. to our knowledge, all bacteria that employ t4p-mediated secretion also produce identifiable t4p  <cit> . furthermore, virulent c. burnetii strains display notable polymorphisms in pil gene composition. specifically, piln of the nine mile strain, pilc of the k and g strains, and pilq of the g and dugway strains, are frameshifted and likely non-functional  <cit> . pilc and pilq are necessary for secretion by f. novicida <cit> . all strains also lack pilp, which is required for t4p production in several bacteria  <cit> . the incomplete and heterogeneous repertoire of c. burnetii t4p genes suggests the gene complement is undergoing genetic decay  <cit> . second, secretion could occur by type i-like secretion. however, this process has been documented in relatively few bacteria and is usually responsible for secretion of a small number of proteins  <cit> . thus, if type i-like secretion is employed by c. burnetii, it would likely be responsible for a small fraction of the secreted proteins. third, and our favored hypothesis, is that the majority of proteins are secreted by omvs. this idea is supported by em showing obvious membrane blebbing and omv production during growth of c. burnetii in media and within mammalian host cells.

the possibility that c. burnetii proteins are secreted by omvs is intriguing given the harsh environmental conditions of the pv lumen. the pv displays properties of a phagolysosome, such as acidic ph and active hydrolases, that can quickly degrade e. coli <cit> . sequestration of proteins by omvs could provide a protective environment for delivery of virulence factors to targets within the pv and potentially to cytoplasmic targets should omv contents transit the pv membrane. omvs can also act as decoys by sequestering antimicrobial peptides before they reach their intended bacterial targets  <cit> . in the context of c. burnetii infection, it is tempting to speculate that, in addition to sequestering antimicrobial peptides, omvs might detoxify superoxide by the activity of encapsulated sodc.

CONCLUSIONS
a list of  <dig> potentially secreted c. burnetii proteins was generated by mass spectrometry of culture supernatant. twenty-seven of these proteins, from a pool of  <dig> candidate secreted proteins as determined bioinformatically, were confirmed to be secreted using c. burnetii transformants expressing flag-tagged versions and immunoblotting. protein secretion was also detected ex vivo, suggesting that sec-mediated secretion contributes to c. burnetii pathogenesis. all the secreted proteins had a signal sequence, which was verified as essential for secretion of  <dig> candidate proteins. dependence on a signal sequence indicates that tolc, t4p or omvs could mediate secretion.
