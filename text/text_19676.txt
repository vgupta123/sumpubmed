BACKGROUND
the pig genome is being sequenced and characterised under the auspices of the swine genome sequencing consortium  <cit> . a data release workshop convened in toronto in may  <dig> by genome canada and other funding agencies affirmed and extended the commitments to prepublication release of large data sets in the life sciences which were originally developed in the context of the human genome project. the toronto statement  <cit>  places obligations on the producers of such data sets, including genome sequence data, in respect of prepublication release of the data and confirms the principle that allows the data producers to publish the first global analyses of the data set. the data producers are encouraged to produce a citable statement or "marker paper" in which they describe the data set and their intentions in respect of analysis and publication. in this marker paper, the swine genome sequencing consortium  sets outs its plans for analysis of the pig genome sequence, for the application and publication of the results. these plans were presented to participants in the pig genome iii conference held at the wellcome trust sanger institute, 2- <dig> november  <dig> 

RESULTS
pig genome sequence data
the sequence data from which a draft pig genome sequence will be assembled comprises hierarchical shotgun sequence data providing 4-6× genome coverage from bac clones representing a minimal tile path across the genome plus > 30× genome coverage in whole genome shotgun sequence  data generated using sanger  and next-gen  technologies. the minimal tile path was identified from a high quality physical  map  <cit>  and provides coverage of  <dig> % of this physical map. as at 5th july  <dig> the total length of the bac-derived sequence contigs, prior to the removal of sequence redundancy between overlapping bac clones, was  <dig>  gbp of which  <dig>  mbp was at finished quality. these sequence data were generated from  <dig>  bac clones of which  <dig>  have been subjected to one round of automated pre-finishing.

prepublication data release
in accordance with the bermuda and fort lauderdale agreements and the more recent toronto statement  <cit>  the data have been released into public sequence repositories  in a timely manner and in advance of publication. assemblies of the genome sequence have been annotated using the pre-ensembl and ensembl automated pipelines and made accessible through the pre-ensembl/ensembl browsers. the current annotated genome assembly  was released with ensembl  <dig> in september  <dig>  the current assembly  was constructed entirely from the bac-derived sequence data.

analysis strategy
a revised assembly  is being constructed from the bac clone derived sequence together with the wgs data. the publication of a draft genome sequence for the pig will be based on this new assembly. a series of analysis working groups have been established in consultation with the pig genome research community under the auspices of the sgsc in order to undertake genome-wide analyses of the genome sequence. these groups with their respective lead contacts are summarised in table  <dig>  details of the work of these groups will be posted on the sgsc website at http://www.piggenome.org.

publication strategy
the swine genome sequencing  <cit>  and swine hapmap  <cit>  consortia respectively propose to develop two summary papers for publication describing a) the sequencing and analysis of the pig genome and b) genetic variation and haplotype structures across a range of pig breeds and related sus species. in addition, the consortia propose to develop a series of companion papers describing either the results from the analysis groups and/or results from other research projects that have been enabled by the publication of a draft sequence of the pig genome. the consortia would be pleased to hear from research groups with plans for manuscripts that could be included within the list of companion papers. please address correspondence to either alan archibald alan.archibald@roslin.ed.ac.uk or larry schook schook@illinois.edu.

discussion
the value of the pig genome sequence lies not only in shaping the continued use of pigs in agriculture and medical research but also in the realm of evolution and domestication   <cit> . the pig is an economically important species not only as a major source of meat-based protein but also increasingly as a model for biomedical research. for example, the pig has value as a model of a spectrum of human diseases that may be modelled less well in rodents, including obesity, arthritis and cardiovascular disease.

the domestic pig  is a eutherian mammal and a member of the cetartiodactyla order, a clade distinct from rodent and primates that last shared a common ancestor with humans between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago. the domestic pig belongs to the suidea family that consists of multiple species, all found in asia, europe and africa. the availability of this wide variety of pig species that diverged over a period of around  <dig> to  <dig> million years provides a rich resource to study genomic changes in relation to speciation. a well characterised pig genome sequence forms a template for the study of within and between species genetic variation. our analysis of the pig genome sequence will be set in the context of parallel research on the genomes of closely related and contemporary suids  and on within breed genetic variation using the  <dig> k pig snp chip  <cit>  and by re-sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS
the pig genome sequencing project has been conducted in an open international collaborative manner in the spirit of the bermuda and fort lauderdale agreements. in accordance with the more recent toronto statement the sequence data have been released in advance of publication. in this marker paper, the swine genome sequencing consortium  sets outs its plans for analysis of the pig genome sequence, for the application and publication of the results.
