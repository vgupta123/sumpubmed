BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni and c. coli are the most common bacterial cause for gastroenteritis in industrialized countries  <cit>  and have been implicated in the development of several post-infectious sequelae  <cit> . most research has focused on c. jejuni, but the role of c. coli in human disease is being increasingly recognized  <cit> . both species share common risk factors for human infections, such as consumption of poultry, foreign travel, and drinking untreated water  <cit> . however, several case-case studies have also observed differences in the risk factors associated with either species, such as c. coli being more common in the elderly and those living in rural areas  <cit> . in addition, c. jejuni is most commonly found in poultry and ruminants, whereas c. coli colonizes pigs more frequently. nevertheless, c. coli is also found in poultry, and it has been suggested that the populations circulating in these animal species are different  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses by sheppard et al.  <cit>  have shown that c. coli strains cluster into three distinct phylogenetic groups . in their analyses, both c. coli multilocus sequence type  st- <dig> and st- <dig> clonal complexes were found in a clade  which showed extensive genome-wide introgression with c. jejuni <cit> . on the contrary, many uncommon c. coli sts, not assigned to a clonal complex, clustered into two separate clades  and showed less than 2% of c. jejuni ancestry, indicating that cross-species exchange had little or no impact on the gene pools of these lineages  <cit> .

although the st- <dig> clonal complex accounts for the majority of c. coli infections in finland, we recently identified a c. coli isolate  from a patient with a domestically acquired infection which had a novel multilocus sequence type  and was deposited into the pubmlst database   <cit> . further characterization of this strain showed that it produced gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase , which belongs to the accessory genome of c. jejuni. ggt is widely distributed in living organisms and is highly conserved. it belongs to the core genome of all gastric helicobacter species and some enterohepatic helicobacter spp.  <cit> . however, among campylobacter spp. it has been detected in only a subset of c. jejuni strains  <cit> , and has shown a strong association with only certain c. jejuni sts  <cit> . the presence of ggt in c. coli has not been described before and opens a question concerning the real impact of cross-species gene exchange between c. jejuni and unintrogressed c. coli lineages.

to investigate the impact of horizontal gene transfer in shaping accessory and core gene pools in unintrogressed c. coli, we carried out an extensive genomic characterization of c. coli, with special emphasis on c. coli clades  <dig> and  <dig>  we provide the first closed genome of a c. coli belonging to clade  <dig>  on which we have performed an in-depth analysis of the gene content and phylogeny. we further defined the core and pan genome of unintrogressed c. coli clades  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and propose a novel view on the evolution of these lineages and their accessory gene content. finally, we show evidence for a sialylated lipooligosaccharide  locus structure; a novel feature for unintrogressed c. coli clade  <dig> 

methods
bacterial strain  <dig>  dna extraction and mlst
c. coli strain  <dig> was isolated from a human patient with a domestically acquired infection in july  <dig>  <cit> . the species was confirmed using species-specific pcr  <cit>  and frozen at -70°c in skim milk with 20% glycerol. subsequent cultivations were routinely done on nutrient agar  supplemented with 5% horse/bovine blood.

dna was isolated with the wizard genomic dna purification kit . mlst was performed as described previously  <cit> .

whole genome sequences and annotation
the genome of c. coli  <dig> was obtained using  <dig> titanium  with a > 30× fold coverage. a combination of a pair-end and 8 kb mate-pair libraries was assembled into a scaffold representing a circular chromosome using mira  <dig> .  <cit> , ssake  <cit> , and the staden software package  <cit> . verification of the scaffold was performed using pcr and sanger sequencing. the shot-gun sequences of  <dig> other c. coli strains  were either downloaded from the ncbi ftp server or kindly provided by dr. samuel sheppard . of these  <dig> c. coli strains,  <dig> were belonging to clade  <dig>  four to clade  <dig> and five to clade  <dig>  for gene finding and automatic annotation, the complete genome sequence of c. coli  <dig> and all the other c. coli shot-gun sequences were uploaded to the rast server  <cit> . the coding sequence of c. coli  <dig> was further analysed using the artemis tool  <cit>  and manually re-annotated the genes of special interest. in particular, homology was identified using ncbi’s blast suite of programs with uniprotkb/swiss-prot as reference database and the conserved functional domains in proteins were identified using interproscan  <cit> . for the prediction of glycosyltransferases we referred to the annotation available in the cazy database  <cit> . the genomes of c. coli and c. jejuni used in this study are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis
for the phylogenomics of c. coli and c. jejuni, the downloaded genomes were aligned with the multiple whole genome alignment tool mugsy  <cit>  by using the “-distance 1000” and “-minlength 100” options, as previously described  <cit> . the maf blocks were concatenated and transformed in fasta file format using the script available in galaxy  <cit> . the resulting core alignment was filtered using gblocks  <cit>  with the minimum length of a block set at  <dig> . a maximum likelihood tree was built using fasttree  <dig>  applying the generalized time-reversible model   <cit> . the model of evolution was selected using jmodeltest  <dig>  <cit> . in order to reconstruct the species tree of c. coli, a second analysis was performed. a fraction of the core genomes  of c. coli strains 317_ <dig>  rm <dig>  bigs <dig> and  <dig>  which showed orthologs in the outgroup species c. upsaliensis was selected. alignments for each of the one-to-one rooted core genes  were first generated at the amino acid level using mafft-fft-ns-i v. <dig>  <cit> , then back-translated to nucleotide sequence using translatorx perl script  <cit> . to account for the presence of possible recombination between the strains, each gene alignment was analysed using 3seq in fullrun mode, setting the bonferroni-corrected p-value cut-off at  <dig>   <cit> , and using pairwise homoplasy index  <cit> , maximum χ <dig> <cit>  and the neighbour similarity score  <cit> , all implemented in phipack package  <cit> . the programme phipack was run by setting window size at  <dig> and the p-value of observing the sequences under the null hypothesis of no recombination at  <dig> . to assess significance,  <dig> permutations tests were performed. genes identified as unrecombined by all the four methods were selected for further analysis. the phylogenetic trees of each aligned unrecombined gene and of the concatenated alignments were inferred using phyml  <cit>  by applying the following parameters: -b - <dig>  -m gtr, -o tlr, -a e, -c  <dig>  a consensus tree based on the  <dig> maximum likelihood trees was generated using the extended majority rule method implemented in consense program available in phylip package  <cit> .

the phylogenetic trees of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidases , sialyltransferases  and 16s rrna genes were reconstructed using bayesian phylogenetic inference. homologs of ggt and cst sequences were available from previous studies  <cit> . the nucleotide sequences were aligned based on amino acid alignment using prank by applying the translatorx perl script  <cit> . a multisequence alignment of full-length 16s rrna genes of the type bacterial strains belonging to ϵ-proteobacteria was downloaded from the rdp website  <cit> . two independent analyses of four mcmc chains run for  <dig> million generations with a tree sample each  <dig>  generations were conducted for each gene using mrbayes v  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . gtr  was selected as evolutionary model and the number of discrete categories used to approximate the gamma distribution was set to  <dig> . to determine whether the data sets support conflicting phylogenies or a single tree, neighbor-net networks were generated using splitstree  <dig>  <cit> .

comparative genomics
orthologous and paralogous groups were determined using orthomcl version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . a database of  <dig>  amino acid sequences, including all the translated coding sequences  of annotated  <dig> c. coli genomes, was assembled . reciprocal all-versus-all blastp was performed and the results were processed by orthomcl using default parameters   <cit> . the orthomcl output was filtered to produce different lists of ortholog/paralog groups which contained:  tcdss from all c. coli strains ;  tcds from all the genomes of a clade;  tcdss from all the genomes of a clade and missing in the other clades;  tcdss from at least one genome of a clade and missing in the other clades.

to identify common orthologs between c. coli  <dig> and the other  <dig> c. coli strains , a second approach was used. the complete set of predicted proteins of c. coli  <dig> was compared to the pan-proteome including c. coli strains belonging to clade  <dig>  clade  <dig> or clade  <dig>  by reciprocal blastp using blast score ratio . the bsr was computed as previously described  <cit> . for each dataset, the blast raw score for each c. coli tcds against itself was stored as the reference score. each c. coli tcds was then compared to each tcds of the c. coli  <dig> predicted proteome with each best blast raw score recorded as query score. the bsr is calculated by dividing the query score by the reference score for each tcds. a cut-off of  <dig>  was used to define if two tcdss were homologs. this approach is more stringent than orthomcl and able to separate distant proteins which may be clustered in the same group by mcl.

phenotypic analysis
ggt activity was measured qualitatively as described before  <cit> . the lps was extracted from c. coli  <dig> grown in nutrient broth for 24 hours using the hot phenol-water method, and subjected to high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection  for the detection of sialic acid, as previously described  <cit> .

RESULTS
general features of c. coli  <dig> and definition of the core genome
a summary of the features of c. coli  <dig> is given in table  <dig> and a circular plot of the chromosome is presented in figure  <dig>  the genome of c. coli  <dig> consists of a single chromosome which includes  <dig>  protein-coding sequences  in a coding area of  <dig> %. a putative function could be predicted for  <dig>   of the cdss, whereas  <dig>  of the cdss were annotated as hypothetical proteins. plasmids, insertion sequences , prophages, and genomic islands were not detected in c. coli  <dig>  differentiating this strain from c. coli rm <dig>  <cit> . compared to other published c. coli and c. jejuni genomes,  <dig> strain has a smaller chromosome and, consequently, possesses a lower number of cdss  <cit> .
campylobacter coli 
 <dig> genome

based on mcl clustering, 97% of  <dig>  the c. coli translated cdss  included in the analysis could be divided into  <dig>  groups of orthologs . a total of  <dig>  gos were detected in the proteome of c. coli  <dig> comprising  <dig> % of the complete set of tcdss. only  <dig> tcdss did not belong to any gos, and were unique for c. coli  <dig> . the core genome of c. coli, defined as the list of orthologs present in all c. coli strains, consisted of  <dig> gos. this value was lower than that found with a previous orthomcl analysis performed with  <dig> c. coli strains  <cit> . in the study of lefébure et al.  <cit> , the core genome of c. coli was defined differently allowing a single strain to miss a core gene, and the authors estimated the core genome to include  <dig>  gos. however, even with a more relaxed definition, allowing a single strain to miss multiple core genes, we estimated the core genome of c. coli to have only  <dig> gos. our estimation is quite similar to the size of the core genome of the genus campylobacter which comprises  <dig> orthomcl gos  <cit> .

phylogenomics of c. coli  <dig> and delineation of c. coli species tree
the phylogenetic position of c. coli  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  the whole-genome alignment of  <dig> ,631 bp, including 64c. coli genomes and five c. jejuni strains , were treated with gblocks which resulted in a gap-less multi-sequence alignment of  <dig>  bp , which was used to build a maximum likelihood  tree. the topology of the ml tree, based on the whole-genome alignment, resembled the neighbour-joining tree based on average genetic distances previously published by sheppard et al.  <cit> , and placed c. coli  <dig> in clade  <dig> of unintrogressed strains  <cit> . in both the ml and the nj tree, the branch of c. jejuni intersects the c. coli tree between clade 1a  and 1b . as previously described, this position does not reflect the true evolution of c. coli, but instead is a consequence of introgression  of clade  <dig>  and in particular of c. coli cc  <dig>  with c. jejuni <cit> . this result indicates that interspecies recombination influences the topology of a ml tree when based on whole-genome alignment.

a previous study showed that in a tree based on  <dig> ribosomal proteins with no evidence of homologous recombination, the branch containing c. jejuni intersected the c. coli tree near to clade  <dig>  <cit> . rooting this tree using c. jejuni as an outgroup showed that clade  <dig> has evolved from a common ancestor before the separation of clade  <dig> and  <dig> [figure 3a and b, ref.  <cit> , indicating that the unintrogressed c. coli strains are paraphyletic. in order to verify the evolution of c. coli, we inferred the species tree using a different approach. we selected one genome for each c. coli clade and c. upsaliensis, which has been demonstrated to be a sister group to the c. jejuni/c. coli clade  <cit> , was chosen as an outgroup. we selected a total of  <dig> core genes out of  <dig> showing no statistically significant recombination among the strains. the ml tree obtained after concatenating those  <dig> unrecombined core genes showed that c. upsaliensis intersects the c. coli tree between clade  <dig>  and clades  <dig> and  <dig> . both nodes are well supported with χ2-based parametric branch values of > 99%. in addition, the same topology was inferred by estimating the consensus tree of each of the  <dig> single gene trees using the extended majority rule method , supporting the results obtained with concatenated genes. in fact, the splits ‘clade1a, clade1b | c. upsaliensis, clade  <dig>  clade 3’ and ‘clade1a, clade1b, c. upsaliensis | clade  <dig>  clade 3’ were present in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the gene trees, respectively. in contrast, the split ‘clade  <dig>  clade1a, clade1b | c. upsaliensis, clade 3’, which would support the topology of the concatenated unrecombined rps genes proposed by sheppard et al.  <cit> , was present in only 28% of the gene trees.

in summary, our data analysis showed that the unintrogressed c. coli strains are monophyletic , suggesting a different evolutionary history than proposed by sheppard et al.  <cit> .

unique features of c. coli clade 3
a total of  <dig>  gos  were detected in all the studied strains belonging to clade  <dig>  however, only six gos were unique to this clade: a putative protease , a protein belonging to cytochrome-c family  and a second dmso reductase system .

serine proteases
the first go unique to c. coli clade  <dig> strains includes a protease  which was found to contain an immunoglobulin a <dig> protease domain in the n-terminus and an autotransporter in the c-terminus. in three strains of clade  <dig>  the protein is probably fragmented and homology was found only in the c-terminal part. this protein belongs to the merops peptidase family s <dig> and bears significant homology to members of the autotransporter family, such as the serine protease autotransporters of enterobacteriacae   <cit> . it had significant blastp hits with putative uncharacterized serine proteases of c. jejuni . however, the homology is limited to the n-terminus of the sequence and does not include the autotransporter domain. reciprocal blastp allowed the identification of another serine protease autotransporter in c. coli  <dig>  which gave a significant bsr  with sequences of only clade  <dig> strains. these sequences belong to the go-cco <dig>  which also contains four proteins present in c. coli clade  <dig> strains. these proteins share the same domains and belong to the merops peptidase family s8a, which includes homologs to subtilisin  <cit> . the clade  <dig> subtilisin-like proteins were distantly related to homologs of c. upsaliensis  and c. jejuni 81– <dig> . in contrast, the clade  <dig> subtilisin-like protein was 100% identical to the c. jejuni 81– <dig> serine protease cjj81176_ <dig>  this indicates that the evolutionary dynamics of both clade  <dig> serine proteases is difficult to predict. the monophyletic relationship between clade  <dig> and  <dig>  suggests gene extinction would not be parsimonious and thus horizontal gene transfer  could have played a major role. nevertheless, gene extinction cannot be completely excluded and would be well supported by the topology of the species tree proposed by sheppard et al.  <cit>  in which clades  <dig> and  <dig> are paraphyletic.

cytochrome-c family protein and a second dmso reductase system
additional features that characterized c. coli clade  <dig> were the cytochrome-c  family protein and a second dmso reductase system. both are likely involved in the respiratory chain, and may confer a metabolic advantage to these strains. both systems have homologs in c. jejuni; cytc bn865_ <dig> showed 91% nucleotide identity with cj <dig> of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> and may have been exchanged between c. jejuni and c. coli clade  <dig>  the second dmso system is organized as described in c. jejuni 81– <dig>  <cit>  and is located in the same region of the genome, yet it’s lower amino acid identity with c. jejuni 81– <dig>  suggests an origin different from cytc.

as observed for the serine proteases, a scenario of gene extinction would be supported by the topology of the species tree proposed by sheppard et al.  <cit> . the monophyletic relationships between clade  <dig> and  <dig> that we found, however, suggests that c. coli clade  <dig> and certain lineages of c. jejuni might have acquired the second dmso system by hgt from independent sources. this makes it tempting to speculate that during the evolution of c. coli clade  <dig> the second dmso system might have been acquired as a consequence of niche adaptation.

additional features of c. coli clade 3
in addition to the six specific c. coli clade  <dig> gos, a total of  <dig> extra gos were found to be present in at least one genome of clade  <dig>  but missing in the other c. coli genomes . several of these groups contain small putative proteins with unknown function, and only a few were also detected in c. coli 76339: a hypothetical protein containing a c-terminal autotransporter domain ; a hemerythrin family non-heme iron protein  and two other hypothetical proteins .
c. coli 
clade 3

the gos describe here were present in at least one genome of c. coli clade  <dig>  but missing in all other c. coli strains.

tonb <dig> and ggt are two common features characterizing unintrogressed clade  <dig> and  <dig> c. coli strains
a total of  <dig> gos were detected to be common in c. coli strains belonging to clades  <dig> and  <dig> , but missing in clade  <dig> . among these, a gene homologous to c. jejuni tonb <dig>  was found to be common in all the strains belonging to clades  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition to tonb <dig>  the gene encoding gamma glutamyltranspeptidase; ggt  was common in all but one unintrogressed c. coli strains.
c. coli 
clades  <dig> and 3

the gos described here were present in at least one genome of c. coli clade  <dig> and  <dig>  but missing in c. coli clade  <dig> 

tonb <dig> transport protein
the tonb protein is involved in iron acquisition and exists in a complex with exbb and exbd, which provides the energy for transport of ferric  iron through the outer membrane receptors  <cit> . so far, a total of three tonb homologs have been described in c. jejuni and the majority of c. jejuni strains contain all genes, yet some strains  possess only tonb <dig> <cit> . similar to c. jejuni, tonb <dig> and tonb <dig> belong to the core genome of c. coli and due to the surplus of sequenced c. coli clade  <dig> strains, the presence of a third tonb gene in c. coli was unknown. here, we show, for the first time, the presence of tonb <dig> in c. coli, which is limited to clade  <dig> and  <dig> strains.

gamma glutamyltranspeptidase
similar to c. jejuni, the ggt gene in c. coli  <dig> is located downstream of a ribosomal operon, which is considered to be a recombinational hotspot and together with the accessory nature of c. jejuni ggt <cit> , this suggests that the c. coli ggt could have been acquired by hgt  <cit> . in order to investigate the possible origin of ggt in campylobacter spp., the phylogeny of ggt orthologs in ϵ-proteobacteria was reconstructed using bayesian inference  and compared to a bayesian species tree of the ϵ-proteobacteria based on the small ribosomal unit . both tree topologies support the hypothesis that ggt was acquired by an ancestral campylobacter species through hgt and originated from an ancestral helicobacter species. however, after acquisition and during evolution of both c. jejuni and c. coli, the gene underwent progressive extinction. this hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence. first, the presence of ggt in only unintrogressed c. coli isolates suggests that the gene evolved separately after speciation and was not exchanged between the two species. this is corroborated by a split decomposition analysis which showed no net-like structure between c. coli and c. jejuni ggt . furthermore, the gene extinction scenario is also supported by the topology of both proposed c. coli species trees . progressive extinction could also be inferred for c. jejuni. the rooted ml tree, representing the evolution of c. jejuni , shows that ggt gradually disappears while moving away from the root. in c. jejuni, ggt is typically found in multilocus sequence types  that are predominant in chickens opposed to those sts that are predominant in bovines and barnacle geese  <cit> . therefore, the original advantage associated with the acquisition of ggt may have vanished during the adaptation of c. coli and c. jejuni as a consequence of niche segregation  <cit> .

additional features of unintrogressed c. coli strains
c. coli  <dig> possesses, in common with three other clade  <dig> strains and one clade  <dig> strain, a gene containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase domain  which is located immediately downstream of a highly conserved alcohol dehydrogenase . although c. coli  <dig> expressed bn865_ <dig> in vitro, the mic for chloramphenicol was lower than 1 mg/l , indicating that the gene may not be able to confer resistance to chloramphenicol and is probably misannotated.

another interesting feature is the structure known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat  locus, which is considered to function as a prokaryotic immune system and protects against invasion of alien genetic elements, e.g. plasmids and phages  <cit> . the crispr locus of c. coli clades  <dig> and  <dig> consists of four spacers and a putative trans-encoded srna sequence . the crispr/cas system in c. coli  <dig> and other clade  <dig> strains possess only the cas <dig> gene , but homologs for cas <dig> and cas <dig> are absent. homologs of the c. jejuni crispr/cas system were found in all strains belonging to clade  <dig> and a subset of clade  <dig> strains. however, the location of the crispr/cas system in the genomes distinguishes introgressed clade  <dig> from unintrogressed c. coli clades  <dig> and  <dig>  in unintrogressed c. coli clades  <dig> and  <dig> the crispr locus is found between roda and dnab, whereas in the strains of clade  <dig> the locus is located in the same position of the genome as described for c. jejuni . these data corroborate the hypothesis of interspecies recombination between c. coli clade  <dig> and c. jejuni proposed by sheppard et al.  <cit>  as well as the monophyletic relationship between c. coli clade  <dig> and  <dig> 

gene flow between c. coli clades
sheppard et al.  <cit>  estimated a 4% genetic exchange between the three c. coli clades. we found several genes in our c. coli  <dig> which were absent in other clade  <dig> strains, but present in clade  <dig> or  <dig> . a high blast score ratio was found for half of the capsule polysaccharide  locus genes with c. coli clade 1a   <cit> . these genes were absent in the other c. coli clade  <dig> and  <dig> strains. in addition, several genes encoding methyl-accepting chemotaxis signal transduction proteins were found; all of which were also present in c. coli clade 1a, but not always in clades 1b, 1c and  <dig>  finally an oxygen-insensitive nadh nitroreductase was commonly found among clades  <dig> and  <dig> and our c. coli  <dig>  but absent in other clade  <dig> strains. thus, gene flow among c. coli clades is possible and probably depends on a number of factors facilitating homologous recombination, such as a shared ecological niche or transient co-colonization of the same host.

the genes listed here were absent in other clade  <dig> strains, but present in c. coli clades  <dig> or  <dig> 

evidence of los sialylation of c. coli 76339
using a blast score ratio cut off of  <dig> , a putative sialyltransferase  was detected . this protein is located in the los locus upstream of three genes necessary for the biosynthesis and transfer of sialic acid , resembling c. jejuni los locus classes a and b   <cit>  but not other c. coli los locus classes described by richards and colleagues  <cit> . the presence of these particular genes in the los locus suggests that strain  <dig> may express sialylated los structures  <cit> . hpaec-pad analysis of the purified los obtained from c. coli  <dig> revealed the presence of sialic acid, supporting the genomic results. this finding is important because it would imply that certain c. coli could also have bacterial factors considered important in the pathogenesis of guillain-barré syndrome  <cit> . it remains unknown, however, onto which substrate the sialic acid is transferred and thus whether or not this structure would mimic human gangliosides, and further studies are needed to deduce the structure.

no evidence has been found of the presence of the neuabc gene cluster in the los locus of any of the  <dig> c. coli strains analyzed in a previous study  <cit> , although it was evident in the cps locus classes vii and viii  <cit> . however, the authors found the presence of a putative sialyltransferase  in two los classes of c. coli . in our mcl cluster analysis we found that the putative c. coli  <dig> sialyltransferase bn865_ <dig> belongs to go-cco <dig> which includes several other sequences from both c. coli clade  <dig> and  <dig>  all the sequences of go-cco <dig>  showed a significant homology to those belonging to the cazy glycosyltransferase family gt <dig>  supporting the idea that all encode putative sialyltransferases  <cit> . further analysis revealed that the clade  <dig> go-cco <dig> sequences corresponded to sialyltransferase  <dig> identified by richards et al.  <cit> . additionally, c. coli  <dig> possesses a second sialyltransferase , which was found to be located in the cps locus of the strain and to have an ortholog in other clade  <dig> strains. this protein gave no significant blastp hits with other c. coli sequences , but it showed 67% identity with c. jejuni atcc  <dig> cst-i. to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship among campylobacter sialyltransferases we inferred the phylogeny of gt <dig> sequences by applying bayesian methodology . the los-associated c. coli sialyltranferases were shown to be monophyletic and distantly related to c. jejuni sialyltransferases. we propose to name these genes cst-iv  and cst-v . the distant relationship observed between los-associated c. coli and c. jejuni sialyltransferases could indicate evolution of different substrate specificity, which has been previously observed among helicobacter sialyltransferases  <cit> . as a consequence, these bacteria may express different sialylated structures on their los. on the contrary, the c. coli clade  <dig> sialyltransferases located within the capsule locus clustered tightly together with c. jejuni cst-i, which supports the notion of interspecies hgt and the potential of sharing similar sialylated glycan structures on the surface.

CONCLUSIONS
from a phylogenetic point of view we found c. coli clades  <dig> and  <dig> to be monophyletic, rather than paraphyletic  <cit> , implying common ancestry, in which both gene extinction and hgt could play a plausible role in the separation of two distinct clades. furthermore, unintrogressed c. coli clade  <dig> strains show potential for an extensive respiratory metabolism; possibly reflecting their wide host range and adaptability to novel niches. finally, we propose a new insight into the evolution of the accessory genome of both c. coli and c. jejuni, which should be exploited further with other dispensable genes.
