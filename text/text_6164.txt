BACKGROUND
hepatitis c virus  infections account for a vast majority of viral hepatitis cases in some geographical areas. in pakistan, around 6% of people are estimated to be infected with hcv  <cit> . these figures are alarming, since patients currently asymptomatic with relatively mild disease will eventually progress to the end-stage liver disease and develop hepatocellular carcinoma . currently, there is no vaccine against hcv and antiviral treatment is not only expensive but relatively toxic and is sufficiently ineffective in treating all of the patients  <cit> . this underscores the need for more effective therapies. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of chronic hcv infections could be helpful in identifying novel therapeutic targets against this disease.

the hallmarks of chronic hcv infection in the liver are inflammation, necrosis, hepatocellular damage and fibrosis. the damage caused by inflammation and necrosis leads generally to proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes, a characteristic of liver regeneration  <cit> . proliferative responses of hepatocytes to hcv infection are particularly important in subsequent pathogenesis as hepatocytes are the primary site of hcv replication and receive different cellular stresses from lymphocytes and kupffer cells. several studies have measured proliferative activity in liver tissue from patients with chronic hcv infection using a variety of markers such as ki- <dig>  proliferating cell nuclear antigen  and mini-chromosome maintenance protein- <dig>   <cit> . among these, mcm- <dig> has been documented as a more sensitive proliferation marker than ki- <dig> in chronic hcv-infected patients  <cit> .

the molecular events during proliferation are related closely to the cell cycle and its regulation. when stimulated to proliferate, hepatocytes first enter the g <dig> phase of the cell division cycle which is followed by dna synthesis, or the s phase. progression through each phase of the cell cycle involves periodic activation of phase-specific protein kinase complexes comprising of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases . therefore, cyclin d-cdk4/cdk <dig> complex is activated in the g <dig> phase and cyclin a-cdk <dig> is activated in the s phase  <cit> . cyclin-cdk complexes are known to be regulated negatively by cdk inhibitors , which are induced in response to different stimuli including dna damage and oxidative stress. one such inhibitor is the p21waf1/cip <dig>  protein that binds to various cyclin-cdk complexes and inhibits the activity of cdk in both p53-dependent and p53-independent fashion  <cit> . both p <dig> and p <dig> may be of relevance while studying the hcv induced disease mechanism, as a number of viral proteins modulate p <dig> and p <dig> expression and activity in vitro  <cit> . besides a role in cell cycle regulation, p <dig> also activates and represses various genes involved in apoptosis, including the gene for pro-apoptotic protein bax and anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  <cit> .

a number of ex vivo studies revealed that the expression of hcv proteins in cultured cells modulates normal cell cycle regulation and apoptosis  <cit> . similarly, studies of liver specimens from patients with chronic hcv infection have also shown impaired hepatocyte proliferation  <cit>  and enhanced apoptosis  <cit>  that may play a role in the subsequent pathogenesis. a recent study has shown marked differences in the phase-distribution of cycling hepatocytes using immunohistochemical staining  <cit> , with a striking reduction in the markers of late cell cycle phases  consistent with g <dig> arrest. moreover, impaired proliferation of hepatocytes has been implicated in the development of cirrhosis  <cit> , suggesting the involvement of cell cycle machinery in liver disease progression. evaluation of the expression of key proteins related to the cell cycle and apoptosis in chronically infected patients with hcv would be of significance to understand disease pathogenesis, and will help in identifying novel prognostic indicators.

in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of cell cycle and apoptotic proteins in chronic hcv-infected patients. the majority  of patients included in our study were infected by hcv genotype- <dig> . such patients are known to have a high prevalence of steatosis  <cit> , which might influence the hepatocyte replication pathway. therefore, we examined whether the proliferation and cell cycle progression of hepatocytes is different in gt- <dig> infected patients as compared to other genotypes. the results indicate an arrested cell cycle state in hepatocytes, as revealed by the reduced expression of s phase cyclin and the increased expression of the g <dig> inhibitor p <dig>  further, no association between the expression of cell cycle regulator p <dig> and that of p <dig> was found. finally, the analysis of apoptosis related proteins caspase- <dig> and anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> expression in the same set of biopsies revealed minimal expression in hepatocytes.

RESULTS
expression of mcm- <dig> and cyclins in hepatocytes
the proliferative potential of hepatocytes was examined by immunostaining for mcm- <dig> that identifies replicating cells as well as cells that are arrested in the cell cycle  <cit> . increased expression of mcm- <dig> was observed in hcv-infected liver tissues  = 11% ) with no significant difference between the genotype  <dig> and others . in normal liver tissue its expression was less than  <dig> %. interestingly, a significant increase in mcm- <dig> expression was found with the progression of the fibrosis stage .

analysis of cell cycle phase markers in patients with chronic hcv infection revealed that the proportion of mcm- <dig> hepatocytes expressing cyclin d <dig>  was 35% , which was significantly higher than that for cyclin a  , mann-whitney u test, p =  <dig> ). in normal liver tissues, cyclin d and a expression was minimal.

expression of cell cycle regulators p <dig> and p53
in normal liver tissues very low expression  of cell cycle regulator p <dig> was observed, whereas 78%  of patients with chronic hcv infection showed increased expression  with a median  of  <dig> % . p <dig> was also expressed rarely  in normal liver tissues. in comparison, 52%  of patients with chronic hcv infection had enhanced expression of p <dig>  with a median  of  <dig> % . of these, 33%  expressed both p <dig> and p <dig>  with no correlation between their expression . p <dig> positive hepatocyte expression correlated with progression of the fibrosis stages  but not with the inflammation grade. in contrast, p <dig> expression was found to be associated weakly with the inflammation grade , but not with the fibrosis stage. no significant association was found between these regulators and the degree of steatosis. similarly, no difference in their expression levels was noted in gt- <dig> patients when compared to patients infected with other genotypes.

expression of apoptosis proteins
expression of the two apoptotic proteins caspase- <dig> and bcl- <dig>  which are involved in apoptosis execution and anti-apoptotic functions, respectively, were assessed. caspase- <dig> was detected in 43% of the patients, and was expressed principally within sinusoidal lining cells, including endothelial cells and kupffer cells . in hepatocytes its expression was relatively low, with a median  of  <dig> % , while no correlation was found between caspase- <dig> and cell cycle regulators or with any of the histological features.

expression of bcl- <dig> was either negative or negligible in the hepatocytes of hcv-infected patients, but was more apparent in other cell types including inflammatory cells and sinusoidal lymphocytes . in normal liver tissues, both caspase- <dig> and bcl- <dig> were rarely detected.

discussion
in the present study, we have examined the expression of cell cycle proteins with particular reference to hcv gt- <dig>  our results provide evidence of p21-mediated hepatocyte cell cycle arrest in chronic hcv-infected patients regardless of any association with gt- <dig>  a previous report by marshall et al has also shown g <dig> arrest in hepatocytes using the same cell cycle markers in a different set of patients  <cit> . we broadened the focus of our study by providing indirect evidence that p <dig> expression was independent of p <dig> expression. furthermore, minimal expression of the apoptosis related protein caspase- <dig> was observed in hepatocytes which were without any detectable expression of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> 

in the initial phases of chronic liver disease, hepatocytes proliferate to restore liver mass and maintain hepatic function  <cit> . consistent with this principle, we found an increased number of hepatocytes expressing the cell proliferation marker, mcm- <dig>  however, the ongoing inflammation and injury causes disruptions in cell cycle progression. these disruptions are evidenced in the present study by decreased expression of s phase cyclin  and increased expression of p <dig>  moreover, the expression of these proteins did not differ significantly in genotype  <dig> infected patients when compared to other genotypes. this indicates that hcv gt- <dig> has no peculiar effect on hepatocyte cell cycle disruption, though a significant difference is observed in its response to the treatment and development of steatosis  <cit> . nevertheless, it can not be neglected that this comparison was made on a small group of patients and further studies to analyze the relevance of the hcv genotype with cell cycle disruption are needed.

expression of both p <dig> and mcm- <dig> proteins in hepatocytes showed a positive association with the progression of fibrosis. this brings into focus the relationship of hepatocyte proliferation and cell cycle arrest with changes taking place in the extra cellular matrix. it also supports previous observations reported by clouston et al which suggested that hepatocyte replicative arrest drives the bile ductular reaction and fibrosis in chronic hcv infected patients  <cit> .

although the association of p <dig> with hepatocyte replicative arrest and disease activity has been described in chronic hepatitis c patients  <cit> , it is not known as to whether this increase is due to up-regulation of p <dig> or some other mechanism. we investigated this aspect by evaluating p <dig> expression in the same set of biopsies and found that both p <dig> and p <dig> co-expressed in only 33%  <cit>  of the patients, but their expression did not correlate with each other. this indicates that p <dig> expression in hepatocytes during chronic hcv infection is probably mediated through p53-independent mechanisms involving tgf-β  <cit>  and oxidative stress  <cit> . on the other hand, hcv might also be involved in manipulating the expression of these cell cycle regulators, as observed in vitro following ectopic expression of viral proteins  <cit> . nonetheless, direct evidence of these virus-induced manipulations in chronic hcv infection is still lacking in literature.

in normal conditions p <dig> expression remains undetectable by immunohistochemistry. however, exposure to a variety of cellular stresses leads either to an increased synthesis rate of wild type p <dig> or the production of a mutated p <dig> with increased stability that would become detectable by immunohistochemistry. we observed an accumulation of p <dig> in the hepatocytes of chronic hcv patients with a significant percentage in the advanced stages of fibrosis. this is consistent with a previous report by papakyriakou et al  <cit>  that has shown p <dig> expression in severe viral hepatitis. but whether this accumulation of p <dig> is due to the increased synthesis or the production of mutated p <dig> is not yet determined. we also observed an association of p <dig> expression with a grade of inflammation that was marginally significant . accumulation of p <dig> in response to inflammatory stress  <cit>  as well as it's contribution to inflammation-induced injury is also noted in published data  <cit> . this could be due to the increased production of reactive oxygen species during inflammation that can directly cause dna damage  <cit>  and thus p <dig> activation  <cit> .

since hepatocyte proliferation plays an important role in the regenerative response to hepatic damage, a replicative arrest in hepatocytes could, therefore, impair the regenerative response of the liver to the ongoing injury. in fact, experiments in knock out mice have shown a significant contribution of the p53/p <dig> system in the impairment of liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy  <cit> . this in turn contributes to the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. moreover, impaired cell cycle kinetics could also lead to the activation of the apoptosis pathway to preserve cell viability and genetic integrity. studies on hepatic biopsies have shown a variable degree of apoptosis in hcv infected patients ranging from  <dig> %–20%, depending on the method used  <cit> . some of these studies have also shown a correlation of apoptosis with liver pathology, but the mechanisms involved were not well defined. in our present study, we analyzed the apoptotic activity by examining the expression of caspase- <dig>  a downstream effector molecule in the apoptotic pathway. caspase- <dig> has been shown to be involved in p <dig> cleavage and the subsequent translocation to cytoplasm in a p53-dependent manner  <cit> . our results revealed a minor expression of caspase- <dig> in hepatocytes, while the p <dig> antigen was apparent in the nucleus of hepatocytes. based on these observations, we contemplate that the increased expression of p <dig> in hepatocytes is probably responsible for the reduced expression of caspase- <dig> in hepatocytes. the inhibitory role of p <dig> in the apoptotic pathway has been documented previously by several investigators  <cit> . on the other hand, our results differ with a previous report by bental et al which showed high caspase- <dig> expression in the hepatocytes of chronic hepatitis c patients  <cit> . possible explanations for this discrepancy could be the different antibodies and sample size used, along with the high prevalence of genotype  <dig> infected patients in our study. we further examined if the low apoptotic index in hepatocytes is due to the high levels of bcl- <dig>  interestingly, bcl- <dig> expression was mainly observed in mononuclear/inflammatory cells but not in hepatocytes, suggesting that the reduced apoptosis in hepatocytes is not due to the anti-apoptotic activity of bcl- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of the cell cycle and apoptotic proteins during chronic hcv infection has shown an impaired proliferation of hepatocytes, which is characterized by increased expression of p <dig> and p <dig>  furthermore, increased nuclear expression of p <dig> in hepatocytes coincides with the minimal expression of the apoptotic protein caspase- <dig> and the anti-apoptotic bcl <dig>  in the scenario of hcv-associated liver inflammation, an altered expression of these cell cycle proteins will probably reduce the number of replicating hepatocytes that can limit the regenerative response of the liver. the present work therefore, offers a broader aspect to understand the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hcv infection.
