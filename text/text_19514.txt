BACKGROUND
the industrial chicory  is a fructan accumulating crop member of the asteraceae family. fructan is a storage carbohydrate used as an alternative to starch by approximately 15% of all flowering plants  <cit> . inulin, a linear polymer made of β- <dig>  linked fructosyl units with a single terminal glucose, is stored in the taproot of chicory. while short oligofructans are used as low calories sweeteners, long inulin chains are dietary fibers also used by the agro-industry as low calories fat substitute. they are considered as health promoting ingredients since they selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial colonic microflora which in turn produces inulin degradation by-products that improve blood parameters  <cit> , reduce pathogenic bacteria  <cit> , increase calcium fixation and reduce the risks of developing colon cancers  <cit> .

the first model describing the fructan biosynthesis pathway was proposed by edelman and jefford  from studies performed in helianthus tuberosus  <cit> , another inulin accumulating crop. inulin biosynthesis requires the sequential action of two enzymes: the sucrose:sucrose- <dig> fructosyltransferase  and the fructan:fructan- <dig> fructosyltransferase . during the initiation step, the enzyme 1-sst catalyses the transfer of a fructosyl unit from a sucrose molecule  to a second sucrose molecule acting as acceptor of fructosyl units to produce 1-kestose , the smallest fructan molecule and free glucose. during the elongation step, the trisaccharide 1-kestose is further elongated through the activity of the enzyme 1-fft using 1-kestose or fructans of higher polymerization degree  as source of fructosyl units . alternatively, 1-fft can use free fructose as acceptor, producing fructosyl only oligosaccharides of the inulose type   <cit> . this model of inulin biosynthesis is supported by in vitro  <cit>  and transgenic studies  <cit>  and is widely accepted by the scientific community despite occasional criticism  <cit> .

in industrial chicory, the average inulin chain length and yield varies during the growing season and between cultivars  <cit> . with the modification of european sugar policy, short inulin chains are now considered as undesirable by-products and breeders look for cultivars accumulating long inulin chains. beside environmental factors, the molecular components of inulin chain length and content variability among cultivars are still unknown even though some strong candidates are proposed. it was demonstrated that the difference of inulin chain length observed between helianthus tuberosus and cynara scolymus is related to the properties of their respective 1-fft  <cit> . in chicory, exposure to cold temperature decreases the transcription and the activity of 1-sst, while transcription and activity of inulin degrading enzymes are increased resulting in a global shortening of inulin chains length  <cit> . while inulin biosynthesis and degrading enzymes are clear targets to investigate the molecular bases of inter-varietal variability of inulin properties, other genetic factors could also be involved such as genes of the photosynthetic pathways, sugar transporters, receptors, perception of cold and water availability, transcription factors, etc.

despite extensive biochemical investigations of inulin metabolism during the last decades, very limited chicory nucleotide sequence resources were publicly available until very recently. this is why we decided to generate  <dig> cdna libraries, mainly from root tissues sampled throughout the growing season. these new nucleotide databases from genes expressed in the root will help to investigate carbohydrate metabolism in fructan accumulating crops.

RESULTS
sequencing and clustering
all cdna libraries were non-normalized. ten root libraries were generated from a single chicory cultivar  harvested during growing season  <dig> , providing a season-wide overview of the genes expressed in chicory roots. the first letter  refers to the organ from which rna were extracted while the second letter refers to the sampling date .

two cdna libraries were also produced from leaves and nodules. the nodule library was obtained from tissue culture of witloof chicory. out of each cdna library, approximately  <dig>  clones were sequenced from their 3'end, reaching a total of  <dig>  3'est sequences. out of  <dig>  chicory ests,  <dig>  sequences remained after removal of repeated sequences, vector and organelle sequences which still represent more than  <dig>  bp. in the future, these sequences will be referred to as the "phytomol" dataset. all the est sequences generated during this research are accessible at ncbi under accession numbers  to .

a unigene dataset was generated using the egassembler bioinformatics pipeline  <cit> . this resulted in the detection of  <dig> % of transposable elements, namely  <dig> dna transposons and  <dig> retro-elements, mainly copia  and gypsy  ltr elements but also one line. over  <dig> simple sequence repeats were detected, representing  <dig> % of the sequences, while low complexity repeats accounted for  <dig> %. in total,  <dig> % of the  <dig> , <dig> sequenced base pairs were repetitive elements.

the egassembler online clustering pipeline returned  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singlets , providing a total of  <dig>  chicory unigenes . when considering each dataset independently, the ratio of "singlets" vs "sequences included in contigs" is rather similar, ranging from  <dig> % for the est library "fc" to  <dig> % for "rg", with an average of  <dig> % for the twelve libraries .

for each est dataset singlets and contigs were sorted using the egassembler bioinformatics pipeline.

the phytomol dataset as a source of snps
in order to quantify the snp discovery rate in the phytomol database, a bio-informatic analysis was performed using the snp/indel discovery pipeline developed by the cgpdb  <cit>  with further manual verifications. this pipeline consists of  <dig> steps containing scripts compatible with third party open source software. starting from the entire phytomol dataset, the first steps generated a set of  <dig>  contigs which were later searched for snp polymorphisms. the average size of these contigs was  <dig> bp as compared to  <dig> bp of the  <dig>  singlets. the number of contigs and singlets is clearly different when compared to the clustering results returned by the egassembler pipeline , indicating that the clustering parameters might be more stringent in order to reduce the interference of paralogs. the number of sequences in these contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  sequences per contig. the final results are reported in table  <dig>  since est sequences are subject to sequencing errors, different significance thresholds were defined. the mm column reports the number of snps detected in the dataset by the cgpdb pipeline: this number is clearly biased by sequencing errors. the mm.good column refers to the number of snps present at least twice in a contig, while the last column indicates the number of snps detected after manual editing of the mm.good results, only considering snp present more than twice  and located outside of the 5' and 3' ends of the contigs or of low quality regions. this manual editing of the contigs drastically reduced the number of snps selected down to  <dig> snps in  <dig> contigs, which represents an average of  <dig>  snps per contig and an average frequency of  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp. visual inspection of these contigs coupled to the average snp frequency indicates that these snps are more than likely "real" snps and not artifacts produced by clustering paralogous sequences, which reinforces the assumption concerning the stringency of the cgpdb clustering parameters.

the snp/indel discovery pipeline generates contigs. depending on the selection stringency , the number of contigs included in the analyses ranged from  <dig>  down to  <dig> when the selection was restricted to clusters containing a least three sequences . within these contigs, those effectively containing snps are reported as well as the total number of snps detected and the average snp frequency in the contigs.

functional characterization of the unigene dataset
the  <dig>  industrial chicory unigenes were searched for homology  against the ncbi nr database. these analyses were performed with the blast2go software  <cit>  with a minimal evalue set to 10- <dig>  among unigenes,  <dig>  sequences  returned a significant blast result. the evalue for blastx results ranged from  <dig> - <dig> to  <dig> - <dig>  for  <dig>   blastx results, the evalue was lower than  <dig> – <dig>  among which  <dig>  were lower than 10– <dig>  figures  <dig> and  <dig> present evalue and similarity distribution charts.

out of the  <dig>  positive blastx results,  <dig>   refer to hypothetical , putative  or unknown/unnamed  gene products.

to classify the sequences in functional categories, the blast results passed through a mapping and an annotation procedure . parameters set up for the annotation process were reviewed previously  and accuracy . gene ontology functional classification terms  could be retrieved for  <dig>  sequences  during the "mapping" procedure performed by blast2go.

out of  <dig>  mapped unigenes ,  <dig>   could be functionally annotated . the initial annotation was converted into a plant specific simplified annotation .

figures  <dig> and  <dig> summarize the relative abundance of biological processes and molecular functions represented in this unigene dataset, according to the gene ontology annotation database  <cit> . molecular function refers to activities such as catalytic or binding activities, while biological processes make reference to a series of ordered molecular functions such as signal transduction or sugar transport.

sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism
one of the scopes of this research was to isolate genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. when searching the functional annotation results ,  <dig> were related to carbohydrate metabolic processes , while  <dig> matched the carbohydrate binding category of molecular functions. out of these  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> could be positioned on kegg  metabolic pathways maps. these  <dig> sequences refer to  <dig> e.c. categories  and take part in  <dig> carbohydrate related metabolic pathways .

 <dig> e.c. classes were detected among the carbohydrate related unigenes. each e.c. class is illustrated by a representative member. the number of genes associated to each e.c. class is detailed in the "abundance" column.

the  <dig> e.c. categories related to carbohydrate take part in one or several of the  <dig> listed metabolic pathways.

searching the gene ontology database  <cit>  with the keyword "carbohydrate" returned  <dig> go terms related to molecular functions , biological processes  or cellular components . each term is associated to a go number. when searching for these  <dig> numbers in the  <dig>  mapped unigenes,  <dig> additional carbohydrate related unigenes were retrieved. among others, these sequences included sugar transporters as well as fructan exohydrolase genes 1-feh i, 1-feh iia and 1-feh iib.

seasonal evolution of functional classes
ten chicory root cdna libraries were produced from tissues sampled during a growing season. two additional chicory leaf and chicory nodule libraries were also prepared for comparison purpose. for each library, approximately  <dig>  clones were randomly chosen and sequenced. while not originating from a clonal population, all these chicory roots originate from a single cultivar  and provide an opportunity to compare, in silico, the evolution of transcripts in chicory root during the growing season. this implicitly assumes that the abundance of an est within a dataset reflects the transcription level of the gene in the corresponding organ at the time of sampling, which somehow overlooks the impact of rna stability on rna abundance.

to monitor the seasonal evolution of functional classes, the twelve chicory est datasets passed through a homology and annotation procedure . each dataset was treated independently for functional classification. for each dataset, the number of sequences detected in each functional category was recorded giving an estimate of their respective abundance. because all datasets did not contain the same number of sequences, the abundances were normalized  according to the number of plant goslim annotation results in each dataset .

this table provides numerical data concerning the number of sequences remaining after each annotation step.

these analyses were performed for "biological processes" and "molecular function".

our aim was then to compare the seasonal evolution of biological processes and molecular function to define groups of similarly regulated/expressed functional classes.

transcriptional clustering analyses were performed with mev   <cit> . functional categories  were clustered with the k-means method using  <dig>  iterations. hierarchical clustering was performed with euclidean distances with "average linkage clustering" as linkage method.

at the level of biological processes,  <dig> classes were detected and grouped in six similarly regulated clusters .

since chicory roots are storage structures, the overwhelming abundance of transport related sequences during the growing season could be related to the storage function of the root.

plants being rooted, the way they respond to biotic and abiotic stimulations is mainly driven by transcriptional regulation since they are unable to adapt their behavior or modify their location. the abundance of sequences in the functional classes related to the response to all types of stimuli  illustrates this biological adaptation.

at the level of molecular functions,  <dig> classes were detected and grouped in six transcriptional clusters . the most abundant molecular functions refer to "hydrolase activity" and "protein binding" as well as to a second cluster containing "structural molecule activity", "transporter activity" and nucleotide "binding".

seasonal evolution of redundant transcripts
until now, transcriptomic arrays are not available for chicory nor any other type of high throughput transcriptomic tools or results. despite the relatively small number of ests available, we were wondering whether analyzing the distribution and abundance of redundant transcripts during the growing season could give any preliminary insights on the root transcriptome.

this in silico northern analysis aims at detecting, on the basis of sequence data, the evolution of transcript levels.

to test the validity of the in silico northern analysis, one of the two key enzymes of inulin synthesis  was individually analyzed in silico. these results were compared with the seasonal expression pattern studied by northern blot  <cit> . the 1-sst enzyme is known to be down regulated at the end of the growing season, especially after exposure to cold temperatures, while 1-fft expression level remains constant. from our in silico analysis,  <dig> sequences of 1-sst were detected in the phytomol dataset and distributed among the various libraries .

the table describes the total number of sequence in each dataset, the number of 1-sst sequences that were detected and their normalized abundance .

from these results, a clear fall in the abundance of 1-sst transcripts was observed starting from the rl library . this fall corresponds to the time when the plant was exposed to minimal temperatures close to 0°c . the second drop corresponds to the exposure to sub-zero temperatures .

these results are in complete agreement with previously published northern blots  <cit>  as well as with semi-quantitative results . differences between time points can probably be explained by the fact that the roots used to produce the libraries originated from a variety and not from a clonal population, something already observed on northern blot results  <cit> .

no other information concerning the seasonal evolution of chicory genes expressed in the root is presently available, or genes for which the information is available are not sufficiently represented in the libraries to allow in silico northern analysis .

from the twelve datasets, all ests were compared to generate groups of identical/homologous sequences : a total of  <dig> clusters were identified, each containing at least  <dig>  and up to  <dig> sequences.

for each cluster, sequences were further subdivided according to their library of origin. abundance was normalized depending on the number of clones sequenced from each library. detailed results obtained for the  <dig> gene clusters are not presented but are available upon request.

the sequence clustering results highlight  <dig> gene clusters which only appear in the leaf and nodule libraries. the nodule library was obtained after tissue culture of chicory witloof leaves. as expected, these sequences were mainly associated to photosynthesis. no nodule specific clusters were identified.

using the mev software, the  <dig> sequence clusters  were grouped in  <dig> expression clusters. one expression cluster groups sequences with similar expression pattern. since cluster  <dig> only contained a single sequence, this cluster was discarded. the remaining  <dig> clusters are shown in figure  <dig> 

the two first columns correspond to the leaf and nodule est databases, while the following ten columns correspond to the ten root databases positioned according to their sampling date .

cluster  <dig> contains sequences nearly exclusively expressed in chicory leaf and nodule. these sequences appear to be linked to photosynthesis.

among clusters containing sequences exhibiting strong expression in one or several contiguous datasets, one can distinguish clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  they both contain sequences highly expressed at the end of the growing season. cluster  <dig> contains sequences presenting amino-acid sequence homology to a putative dehydrine , two chicory vegetative storage proteins  and one sequence with homology to pectin-methylesterase .

cluster  <dig> contains sequences with homology to a dehydrine , a catalase from helianthus annuus  and the most abundant sequence of the entire dataset  which remains until now unidentified.

these results indicate preferential expression of sequences involved in response to cold stress  and detoxification of reactive oxygen species  at the end of the growing season. storage proteins are also abundant since three chicory vegetative storage proteins were detected.

cluster  <dig> contains several sequences significantly overexpressed in the rs dataset obtained from samples harvested late in the growing season, after exposure to cold temperatures. these sequences present homology to a dehydrin , an aba-responsive protein , a mitogen activated protein kinase  <dig> , a spliceosome associated protein , a cysteine protease , an rna binding protein homolog , a ubiquitin-associated uba/pb <dig> domain containing protein , a quinone oxydoreductase homolog , a hexameric polyubiquitin , an elongation factor beta- <dig>  and a protein wsi <dig> water stress induced . these sequences highlight the presence of proteases and protein degradation through ubiquitination. water and cold stress associated proteins are also detected such as dehydrin, a water stress induced and an aba-responsive protein.

the biological meaning of most of the other clusters remains however still speculative, since they were defined on the basis of a few sequences out of each library. in addition, the clustering process can misleadingly associate together two closely related but distinct sequences. in consequence, these results have to be taken as indicative and still need to be further investigated.

discussion
expressed sequence tags  are tools of choice to investigate the expressed portion of an uncharacterized genome. prior to this publication, only two datasets were publicly released:  <dig>  ests from chicory somatic embryo  published in  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  ests from the cgpdb released on february  <dig>   <cit> . these two datasets have now been merged into a single database of  <dig>  ests, representing, according to their analysis,  <dig>  putative unigenes. the phytomol dataset represents the second most important est collection for chicory and is unique in that it consists of  <dig> distinct libraries of genes mainly expressed in the roots during one entire growing season. the non redundant phytomol dataset consists of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets for a total of  <dig>  unigenes according to egassembler analysis results. to evaluate the level of redundancy between the phytomol and the cgpdb datasets, all the sequences  passed through the egassembler clustering pipeline: a total of  <dig>  unigenes were retrieved, which is slightly more than the number of unigenes present on the cgpdb website . performing the clustering of the  <dig>  chicory ests from the cgpdb dataset with egassembler returns  <dig>  unigenes . this indicates that the parameters used by cap <dig> in the egassembler pipeline may underestimate the effective diversity of the dataset. as observed from the result list, for these last tests, and under cap <dig> clustering conditions used by egassembler, our chicory dataset contains  <dig>  unigenes which were present neither in the somatic embryo est database, nor in the original cgpdb chicory dataset. we believe that these additional unigenes do not result from low quality sequences but rather from extensive sampling of genes expressed in the root throughout the growing season. this assumption of non exhaustivity of the cgpdb was also reported by legrand  <cit> , who mentions that 31% of the chicory ests expressed in somatic embryos did not yield any significant homology results when compared to the asteraceae databases.

concerning the snp discovery rate in the phytomol dataset, it varies depending on the snp selection criterions used by the cgpdb detection pipeline and during our manual editing. since we only investigated the phytomol dataset, it is likely that including other available chicory ests would increase the number of putative snps that could be retrieved by datamining.

among the  <dig>  putative unigenes of the phytomol dataset,  <dig>   returned a significant blastx result, which is 16% less than the 87% reported by legrand for chicory somatic embryo ests  <cit> . the functional annotation of these unigenes highlighted "transport" as the most diversified class of biological processes. in chicory, most photosynthates have to be exported through the phloem and unloaded into the root, which is probably why transporter and protein binding activities were diversified and abundant in chicory roots.

many different sequences were also associated with "hydrolase activity" as well as "protein binding" early in the season , at a period when chicory roots only started to accumulate carbohydrates. this period corresponds to a time of high energy demand, which could require massive sugar degradation to cope with metabolic needs.

most other classes of molecular functions were evenly abundant during the growing season. this apparent transcript level stability reflects abundance steadiness rather than sequence identity within a functional category: the nature of the sequences could change within a functional category while the average abundance of this category remained constant along the season.

despite this limitation, the phytomol dataset was also used for in silico northern analyses of  <dig> individual sequences, classifying them into  <dig> clusters of presumably similarly regulated genes . clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contain sequences expressed after exposure to cold temperature. in these four clusters, a clear overexpression of cold and water-stress related sequences  was observed as expected. a good correspondence was also found between in silico analysis of 1-sst abundance in the phytomol dataset and literature reports. however, these observations have to be considered as preliminary and indicative since most unigenes contained only a limited number of sequences which limits the power of this analysis.

one of the aims of this study was to isolate genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. the est approach was indeed successful in isolating more than  <dig> chicory partial sequences of such genes expressed mainly in the root.

CONCLUSIONS
expressed sequence tags  are valuable tools for genomic research in non model species such as industrial chicory. this project allowed generation and characterization of more than  <dig>  ests obtained from twelve chicory libraries, ten of which from roots sampled during the growing season. the resulting dataset yielded nearly  <dig>  putative unigenes, from which over 70% were presenting blastx homologies to publicly available sequence resources.

recently, two other est datasets were released, pinpointing the increasing interest of the scientific community for asteraceae as proven by the set-up of the compositae genome project database. our contribution yielded more than  <dig>  new unigenes.

when analyzing the sequence clusters produced to generate the contigs, abundance of polymorphisms were detected: simple sequence repeats, insertions, deletions as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms. the use of this genic polymorphism for molecular marker design will be considered in the future for breeding purpose.
