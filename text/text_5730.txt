BACKGROUND
bacterial periplasmic binding proteins  are receptors for extracellular solutes in metabolite uptake  <cit> , chemotaxis  <cit> , and intercellular communication  <cit>  processes. the pbps collectively constitute a structural protein superfamily characterized by two pseudo-symmetric domains that are linked by a hinge formed by two or three β-strands connecting the domains; a ligand-binding site is situated at the interface between the two domains  <cit> . each domain adopts a three-layered α/β/α sandwich fold and is classified into one of three structural sub-categories   <cit>  according to β-strand topology.

ligand-free pbps adopt an open conformation in which the inter-domain interface is exposed to solvent. solute binding induces a conformational change to form a closed state in which the ligand is bound at the domain interface and buried by the surrounding protein  <cit> . this closed form typically binds to other molecular components to trigger downstream cellular processes such as chemotaxis  <cit> , quorum sensing  <cit> , and transmembrane ligand transport  <cit> . eukaryotic receptors that contain the pbp fold as part of multi-domain proteins are also regulated by ligand-induced conformational coupling mechanisms  <cit> .

a collection of pbp structures determined in both apo and ligand-bound states  has provided a wealth of information on the ligand-induced domain motions of pbps. analysis of the ligand-induced conformational changes in pbps has to differentiate between different types of motions: large-scale  movements, loop movements, relative intradomain movements of secondary structure elements, and amino acid side-chain reorganization. large-scale changes in pbps can be described as a rigid body motion of the two domains, characterized by bending/twisting motions around two axes  <cit> . the magnitude of this hinge-bending motion ranges from 62° in a mutant e. coli ribose-binding protein  <cit>  to as little as 14° in the leucine-binding protein  <cit> . pbps such as the e. coli ribose-binding protein   <cit>  and allose-binding protein  <cit>  have been shown to adopt a series of intermediate values in their apo state suggesting that the observed states represent snapshots of a continuum between two extremes: the defined closed form, and a less precisely defined fully open conformation.

pbps which have been found to adopt multiple open forms  are indicated with an asterisk.

in e. coli rbp  small-scale backbone movements are restricted to the hinge region, whereas the secondary structure elements in the two domains and the amino acids in the binding pocket adopt essentially the same conformations in both the apo and ribose-bound forms  <cit> . however, in e. coli leucine-binding protein, not only the hinge region, but also loops and amino acid side-chains in the binding pocket show ligand-induced changes  <cit> , many of which are restricted to one domain. this difference in conformational changes between the domains has been postulated to imply ordered interactions between the protein and ligand  <cit> .

the ligand-induced conformational changes have not been described previously in a thermophilic pbp. we have characterized the stability, determined the ligand-binding properties, and solved the x-ray crystal structures of the apo and ligand-bound forms of a thermophilic periplasmic ribose-binding protein from the hyperthermophile thermotoga maritima , the mesophilic homolog, ecrbp, of which has been studied in detail  <cit> . the ecrbp and tmrbp proteins share 39% amino acid sequence identity, but differ by 52°c in apparent thermal stability. we find that the interdomain motions, although not of the same magnitude, exhibit similar movements. the amino acids in the tmrbp sugar-binding pocket undergo ligand-induced conformational changes, whereas their conformations in apo ecrbp are essentially pre-formed for ligand binding.

RESULTS
expression
the rbp gene was identified in the t. maritima genome sequence  <cit>  as open reading frame  tm <dig>  based on sequence similarity to the e. coli rbp, and genetic linkage of this orf within a putative operon that contains sequences for abc transporters characteristic of a ribose transport system  <cit> . orf tm <dig> was amplified from t. maritima genomic dna using the polymerase chain reaction. the resulting dna fragment was cloned into a pet21a vector with a c-terminal hexa-histidine tag preceded by a glycine-serine linker. the nucleotide sequence of the recombinant was confirmed by dna sequencing. over-expression of this orf in e. coli produced ~ <dig> mg of pure protein per liter of growth medium, which was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography  <cit>  followed by gel filtration chromatography.

the gel filtration elution profile of tmrbp consists of two peaks, one of which is consistent with a monomeric tmrbp , the other consistent with a ~ <dig> kda protein . sds-page of the resulting fractions revealed that both peaks contain tmrbp. the fractions corresponding to the  <dig> kda protein also contain significant amount of a ~ <dig> kda species . tryptic digestion of this  <dig> kda protein, followed by maldi mass spectrometry peptide mapping  <cit> , revealed that it corresponds to a truncated form of the full-length tmrbp . the  <dig> kda protein is therefore a heterodimer consisting of one full-length and one truncated copy of tmrbp. neither full-length, nor truncated homodimers were observed. analysis of the tm <dig> dna sequence suggests that this truncation may result from translation initiation at methionine  <dig> , which is preceded by a ribosome binding site . this interpretation is further supported by the m142a mutant tmrbp in which the  <dig> kda truncation is absent .

thermal stability
the apparent thermal stability  of full-length monomeric wild-type tmrbp was determined by thermal denaturation using circular dichroism   <cit> . in the absence of denaturant, no significant change in the cd signal could be observed as a function of temperature . all measurements were therefore carried out in the presence of the chemical denaturant guanidine hydrochloride  to bring thermal denaturation into a measurable range. melting curves were found to fit a two-state model  <cit> . an apptm in the absence of gdcl was determined by linear extrapolation of a series of melting point determinations carried out at different gdcl concentrations  <cit>   and was found to be 108°c. tmrbp is significantly more stable than the mesophilic ecrbp ). addition of the  <dig> kda truncation has no effect on the apptm value of the full-length wild-type monomeric protein .

ligand binding
ribose binding was observed as a ligand-mediated change in the apptm of full-length wild-type monomeric tmrbp in the presence of  <dig>  m gdcl. under these conditions the apptm is 71°c in the absence of sugar and 97°c in the presence of  <dig> mm ribose, indicating that tmrbp is a ribose-binding protein, as predicted from sequence homology . for the ligand-bound form , an apptm of 131°c in the absence of gdcl was determined by linear extrapolation of a series of melting point determinations carried out at different gdcl concentrations  <cit>  .

structure determination
crystals of ribose-complexed tmrbp were grown using a full-length wild-type construct  that lacks the periplasmic signal sequence . the apo-protein was crystallized using a construct that consisted of residues 30– <dig> , containing a m142a mutation to prevent expression of the in-frame orf. we were unable to obtain crystals of the heterodimeric form. the apo-protein and ribose-complex diffract to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å resolution and were refined to rcryst/rfree values of  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>  respectively. the x-ray crystal structure of ribose-bound tmrbp was solved by molecular replacement using ecrbp as the search model  <cit> . the apo-form of tmrbp was solved by separately searching with the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the ribose-bound form of tmrbp. data collection, refinement, and stereochemistry statistics are summarized in table  <dig>

overall structure and comparison of the e. coli and t. maritima apo proteins
the apo forms of ecrbp  <cit>  and tmrbp adopt the same overall fold. however, the relative inter-domain angles  <cit>  differ significantly  . the hinge in ecrbp is very flexible as evidenced by the number of crystal forms that differ in the inter-domain closure angle  <cit> . the two molecules found in the tmrbp asymmetric unit differ in the inter-domain closure angle by 10°, analogous to the conformational heterogeneity observed in ecrbp  <cit> .

the construct used to crystallize the apo-form of tmrbp was a c-terminally truncated form of the protein . it is possible that the absence of this region could in some way influence the observed conformation of apo form of tmrbp. however, superimposition of the tmrbp ribose complex c-terminal domain onto the c-terminal region of the apo protein suggests that these this region does not form interdomain interactions in the absence of ligand.

overall structure and comparison of the e. coli and t. maritima ribose complexes
the structure of the tmrbp ribose-complex is similar to the ribose complexes observed in ecrbp  <cit>  and a thermophilic rbp obtained from thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis  <cit>  . both structures superimpose on tmrbp with a  <dig>  Å rmsd calculated over cα atoms . the structures tterbp and ecrbp are almost identical  <cit> ; comparisons are described therefore only for ecrbp. the largest differences between ecrbp and tmrbp are at the c-termini, where tmrbp is extended by an additional  <dig> residues that are not present in ecrbp. this segment forms a short α-helix terminated by a β-hairpin . one of the amino acids in this region  forms extensive van der waals interactions with the amino acids in the n-terminal domain . as similar extensions are found interacting with the n-terminal domain in both open and closed forms of other pbps  <cit> . we postulate that these c-terminal extensions form inter-domain interactions that may be important for modulating the intrinsic free energy difference between the apo and closed forms in the absence of ligand .

although ribose is commonly found as a furanose carbohydrate in biological molecules , all periplasmic rbps, including tmrbp, bind the β-anomer of d-pyranose ribose  <cit>  . β-d-pyranose ribose the most prevalent form in solution under ambient conditions   <cit> . the ligand-binding site of tmrbp is composed of a network of polar amino acids which is identical in sequence and hydrogen-bonding pattern to the e. coli protein  <cit>  . seven polar amino acids make a total of eleven hydrogen-bonds with the ribose. one residue in ecrbp  has been postulated to be important for both ligand-binding and hinge-bending; in the closed form it forms hydrogen-bonds with the ligand and amino acids from both domains  <cit> . the equivalent residue  and the amino acids which it interacts with are conserved in tmrbp. this pattern of conservation suggests that similar mechanisms couple ligand-binding to conformational changes in both proteins  <cit> .

the ribose is wedged between three aromatic amino acids  which make extensive van der waals interactions with the sugar ring. in ecrbp the equivalent aromatic binding pocket residues are all phenylalanines. alignment of tmrbp and ecrbp structures indicates that the six-membered ring of w <dig> in tmrbp is equivalent to f <dig> in ecrbp .

open to closed transition: global changes
the addition of ribose to tmrbp induces a 28° hinge-bending motion  <cit>  mediated about residues 102– <dig>  244– <dig>  and 271– <dig>  the hinge-bending motion of tmrbp is smaller than the 43° change observed in ecrbp  <cit> . in both ecrbp and tmrbp, the effects of these motions on the backbone are confined largely to the hinge region .

the two molecules in the tmrbp asymmetric unit have slightly different degrees of closure, indicative of an intrinsic flexibility of the hinge, as observed in ecrbp  <cit>  and e. coli allose-binding protein  <cit> . molecule b is related to molecule a by a 10° closing about the hinge. this movement is limited to one of the two strands  which connect the two domains . the magnitude of cα torsion changes transitioning between the open and closed states is significantly greater for molecule b than molecule a ; the average b-factors of the two molecules are the same.

open to closed transition: local changes
in ecrbp and tmrbp local ligand-induced changes are restricted largely to the hinge region, the n-terminal amino acids that interact with ribose, and the hinge amino acid  that interacts with the ribose . the amino acid side-chains in the c-terminal domain of tmrbp remain fixed in the same rotameric state in both apo and ligand-bound forms . by contrast, the side-chain torsional changes in the n-terminal domain of tmrbp are significant; in particular, w <dig> and f <dig> undergo torsional movements about χ <dig> and χ <dig> . this ligand-induced binding pocket rearrangement of the n-terminal domain is also observed in ecrbp, but of smaller magnitude than in tmrbp, and is restricted to three polar amino acids  .

c-terminal amino acids are in bold face type; the hinge amino acid that interacts with ribose is indicated by an arrow. where amino acid numbering differs, ecrbp residues are listed first.

solvent interactions in tmrbp and ecrbp
water molecules play an important role in the hinges of pbps  <cit> . analysis of the conservation pattern of bound water molecules among various pbps identifies critical water molecules that participate in inter-strand hydrogen bonding in the hinge, in place of amino acid side-chains  <cit> . the positions of four bound water molecules are conserved  in the open forms of ecrbp and tmrbp. one of these water molecules  is conserved in both the open and closed forms of group i pbps  <cit> . this water molecule remains fixed in position in both the apo and ligand-bound forms. it is postulated to act as a "ball bearing" by serving as a fixed intra-hinge rotation point for the two domains  <cit> . it also mediates indirect interstrand hydrogen bonding. another water molecule conserved among other group i pbps, w <dig>  <cit> , is absent from tmrbp. when present, this water mediates hydrogen-bonding between the first and last inter-domain strand in both the open and closed forms of group i pbps. in tmrbp the conformation of the hinge strands permits direct inter-strand hydrogen-bonding between the main-chain nitrogen of residue  <dig> and the main-chain oxygen of residue  <dig>  thereby replacing the contacts that would be made by w <dig>  <cit> .

no water molecules interact directly with ribose in either ecrbp or tmrbp. nevertheless, nine out of eleven water molecules within a 7Å sphere of the ribose are conserved among the sugar complexed forms of ecrbp and tmrbp. in the ecrbp ribose complex, w <dig> forms hydrogen-bonds with two of the hinge strands in the closed form. the opening motion of ecrbp forces out this solvent molecule, replacing the water-mediated hydrogen bonds with inter-strand hydrogen bonds  <cit> . w <dig> is absent from the ribose-bound tmrbp structure, as it is in e. coli arabinose-binding protein  <cit> . in both instances, the hinge conformation allows for inter-strand hydrogen-bonding to satisfy the water-mediated hydrogen-bonds that would be formed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized the ligand-binding properties of a putative ribose-binding protein identified in the genomic sequence of the extremophilic bacterium t. maritima and solved its x-ray crystal structure in the absence and presence of ribose. the structure reveals that tmrbp has high structural similarity to its mesophilic homolog ecrbp. polar ligand interactions and ligand-induced global conformational changes are conserved  <cit> . local structural rearrangements involving side-chain motions in the ligand-binding site differ in the mesophilic and thermophilic rbps. in ecrbp the conformation of the binding pocket undergoes little ligand-induced rearrangement. the amino acids in the n-terminal domain of the tmrbp binding pocket undergo large χ <dig> and χ <dig> torsional changes, whereas the c-terminal domain remains fixed. based on hydrogen-bonding pattern  and buried surface area  it has been postulated that ordered binding occurs and ribose initially interacts with n-terminal domain of ecrbp  <cit> . if an order of interaction can be established from analysis of structure, it is likely to proceed with ribose initially interacting with the c-terminal domain of the apo tmrbp, as the entropic costs of fixing the side-chains for ligand binding should be reduced for a pre-ordered binding site.

water molecules have been suggested to play an important mechanistic role in the evolution and adaptation of the pbp hinge  <cit> . in particular, two water molecules, , are closely associated with the hinges of group i pbps  <cit> . in tmrbp, w <dig>  which is postulated to act as a "ball bearing" in the ligand-mediated conformational change, is conserved in both the apo- and ribose-bound forms. on the other hand, w <dig>  which is involved in mediating important inter-hinge contacts in apo- and ligand-bound group i pbps, is absent in both forms of tmrbp. in tmrbp the inter-strand hydrogen bonds form directly in the hinge. these differences in water interactions in the hinges of pbps suggest local structural differences can supplant the need for w <dig>  whereas the role of w <dig> cannot be accommodated through differences in main-chain geometry or side-chain identity.

ligand-induced hinge bending motion is a key characteristic of the periplasmic binding protein superfamily. analysis of pbp structures has provided a detailed description of this class of conformational change  <cit> . the detailed comparative analysis of the open to closed transition of the thermophilic tmrbp and mesophilic ecrbp presented here illustrates the subtle differences in the mechanism and magnitude of the ligand-induced conformational changes, and the interplay between global and local conformational changes in this protein superfamily.
