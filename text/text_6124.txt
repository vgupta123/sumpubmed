BACKGROUND
dengue virus  is a virus of the flaviviridae family. it is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna arbovirus with a genome of approximately 11 kb  <cit> . there are four antigenically distinct denv serotypes; denv- <dig>  denv- <dig>  denv- <dig> and denv- <dig>  <cit>  and each serotype shows phylogenetically distinct genotypes  <cit> . the virus is transmitted to susceptible hosts through bites of infected mosquitoes. the virus is maintained in sylvatic nonhuman primate/sylvatic mosquitoes and endemic human/urban/peridomestic mosquitoes cycles. all four denv serotypes are believed to have independently evolved from separate sylvatic ancestral lineages through either peridomestic/urban mosquitoes or human hosts 100– <dig>  years ago  <cit> . currently, an estimated  <dig>  billion persons living in dengue-endemic countries are at risk of contracting dengue. the number of countries reporting dengue has in recent years escalated to more than  <dig> suggesting successful adaptation and dissemination of the virus  <cit> .

in dengue endemic regions, heterotypic and homotypic major dengue outbreaks occur in cyclical patterns of approximately every 3–5 years and 7–10 years, respectively  <cit> . the major concern associated with recurring dengue outbreak in endemic countries is the risk of contracting the severe forms of dengue especially following second infection with a heterotypic virus  <cit> . antibody-dependent enhancement  <cit> , original antigenic sin  <cit> , cytokine storm  <cit> , and autoimmune responses  <cit>  are the possible mechanisms contributing to the manifestation of severe dengue. it has been reported that infection with one denv serotype confers lifelong protection against homotypic reinfection but only temporary cross-protection against heterotypic infection  <cit> . the presence of sub-neutralizing and cross-reacting antibodies is suggested to play important role in the manifestation of the severe dengue  <cit> . reports of repeated infection with dengue is however, not uncommon in dengue endemic regions  <cit> . understanding the factors contributing to the recurrence of dengue outbreaks has important implications for our understanding of dengue epidemiology. knowledge gained from this understanding could help improve dengue surveillance and outbreak prediction and preparation. it could also help to facilitate selection of better dengue vaccine candidates.

earlier studies have suggested that denv clade replacement is linked to the recurring and cyclical pattern of dengue outbreaks in many endemic countries  <cit> . from these studies, it is suggested that clade replacement is associated with positive selection due to the differences in viral fitness between clades; new virus with a higher viremia level in human  <cit>  or enhanced infectivity to mosquito  <cit>  could be positively selected to replace the old virus which was less fit. in contrary, several other phylogenetic studies of denv have suggested that the clade replacement is solely a stochastic event due to the virus population bottleneck effects  <cit> . although the potential mechanisms of denv evolution underlying the clade replacement have been investigated, correlation studies involving the host immunological factors have not been adequately addressed. zhang et al. proposed that the denv- <dig> clade replacement is associated with the cross-protective immunity accorded by denv- <dig> based on a longitudinal dengue epidemiological study in bangkok  <cit> . whereas adams et al. employed a mathematical model to demonstrate that the degree of interserotypic cross-protective immunity could account for the cyclical pattern of heterotypic outbreak in bangkok  <cit> .

in the present study, we used the recurring denv- <dig> outbreaks in malaysia which occurred in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , as a study model. the availability of serially collected denv- <dig> since  <dig> within a single locality  provides us with an opportunity to explore the temporal phylogenetic evolution that shapes the virus clade replacement in recurring denv- <dig> outbreaks in malaysia. we used denv- <dig> full length envelope  gene sequence to reconstruct the phylogeny and investigated the presence of homotypic cross-neutralizing antibody of patients with primary denv- <dig> infection.

RESULTS
in the study, a total of  <dig> malaysian denv- <dig> isolates collected from  <dig> to  <dig> were used. all viruses were isolated from dengue patients living in single locality, klang valley. between the periods, three major denv- <dig> outbreaks occurred in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a cyclical pattern of ~8 years interval   <cit> . preliminary phylogenetic analysis performed using the full e gene sequence revealed that the virus collection comprised of denv- <dig> from genotype i, ii, iii and sylvatic group with frequency of  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively , suggesting that denv- <dig> outbreaks in malaysia over the last  <dig> decades were mainly caused by the genotype i and ii viruses. figure  <dig> summarized the relative percentages of denv- <dig> genotypes isolated during the three major outbreaks. due to the large number of denv- <dig> available for each outbreak, the viral sequences with >98% nucleotide identity within each monophyletic group were reduced to 3– <dig> sequences. a total of  <dig> representative isolates that covered all possible viral genetic diversity over time were presented in this study.

the bayesian phylogenetic tree constructed using the full e gene sequence  revealed the existence of at least six distinct genotypes : three ancestral genotypes  and three endemic/epidemic genotypes  in concordance to the previous classification method  <cit> . denv- <dig> genotype i viruses were involved in outbreaks in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while genotype ii viruses were only involved in the  <dig> outbreak.

genotype i comprised mainly of the asian strains with the exception of an african strain . the genotype i viruses from the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks grouped into clade ia, ib and ic, respectively in a ladder-like topology  suggesting temporal clade replacement occurred in each of the major denv- <dig> outbreak. all the genotype i clades consisted of thai viruses with approximately similar isolation years , suggesting that the same pool of denv- <dig> strains circulated within thailand  <cit> . viruses in clade ia and ib shared clear ancestral lineages with thai isolates whereas those forming clade ic could have evolved from another malaysian isolate seen in  <dig> . the clade ic viruses caused the largest major denv- <dig> outbreak in malaysia in  <dig> and the viruses shared high sequence similarity to isolates recovered from a major outbreak in singapore in  <dig>  <cit> . the clade ic viruses were recovered much earlier in thailand , china , cambodia , vietnam  and myanmar  before it caused outbreak in malaysia and singapore. though all the clade ic viruses shared common ancestral lineage to the malaysian  <dig> isolate, it is possible that the malaysian  <dig> virus was endemic in malaysia but remained in the background until it achieved fitness to cause outbreak later in  <dig>  <cit> . this fit the expected homotypic cycle of major dengue outbreak in malaysia at approximately every 8 years. since the  <dig> outbreak, clade ic viruses were continuously isolated in malaysia, singapore, thailand, vietnam, cambodia and china until  <dig> and no clade replacement event of denv- <dig> was observed then. the magnitude of  <dig> outbreak involving many asian countries could probably extent the time interval between the occurrences of major homotypic denv- <dig> outbreaks in the future. to date, the clade ic viruses have been imported into japan , south korea , taiwan , sri lanka , indonesia  and ireland   <cit>  suggesting a possible global spread of the virus to other parts of the world. this could represent the most successful distribution of denv- <dig> to date akin to that observed for the cosmopolitan denv- <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, the persistence of a ladder-like phylogenetic tree topology predicts possible emergence of a clade id denv- <dig> in the next major denv- <dig> outbreak in malaysia perhaps in or around  <dig> 

the genotype ii viruses obtained in the study shared high sequence similarities to viruses from a wider geographical distribution including asia and pacific ocean regions with the exception of an indian ocean strain . in addition to clade ib, genotype ii viruses  were also recovered during the  <dig> outbreak. phylogenetic analysis suggests that the clade iia viruses could have evolved from another malaysian isolate seen in  <dig> . the clade iia viruses are likely the indigenous denv- <dig> of malaysia as no virus from other country was found within the clade. in contrast, clade iib viruses grouped with isolates from indonesia and south pacific islands including micronesia and polynesia. all the clade iib viruses shared common ancestral lineage to the indonesia  <dig> isolate. the presence of the indonesian isolates during the  <dig> outbreak could be due to importation of the viruses through influx of migrant workers as there was a surge of workers from indonesia to malaysia during that time  <cit> . in  <dig>  two isolates, d <dig> malaysia.32858/ <dig> and d <dig> malaysia.32581/ <dig>  which shared high sequence similarities to the clade iib viruses were recovered. this could be either another incidence of importation of the indonesian isolate or an in situ evolution of the clade iib viruses. the importations of denv- <dig> strains from the neighboring countries would increase the genetic diversity of denv- <dig> in malaysia.

genotype iii consisted of mainly denv- <dig> isolates from latin america. asian and african strains of the genotype iii, however, have been occasionally isolated. the genotype iii viruses from malaysia, d <dig> malaysia.59266/ <dig> and d <dig> malaysia.11738/ <dig>  grouped with isolates from saudi arabia, brunei, india, singapore and china and shared common ancestral lineage to the thai  <dig> isolate. in our samples, only  <dig> genotype iii isolates  were recovered from patients during the period 1987– <dig>  the virus has not been isolated since  <dig> which suggests its possible extinction from malaysia. similar findings were observed in thailand and myanmar in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the lineage extinction of genotype iii was hypothesized to be due to a stochastic event attributable to possible low rate of virus transmission during an inter-epidemic period  <cit> . however, the emergence of genotype iii virus in singapore in  <dig> suggests possible reintroduction of genotype iii virus to malaysia in the future  <cit> .

using the ancestral sylvatic virus e amino acid sequence  as the basal sequence, the consensus amino acid sequences of all the malaysian isolates were found highly conserved, with identities ranging from  <dig> to 98% between the genotypes . although the genotype japan/hawaii 1943– <dig> viruses served as the common ancestral lineage for all the genotype i viruses , the identities of consensus amino acid sequences between sylvatic virus and genotype i viruses were found to be higher  than those between the japan/hawaii 1943– <dig> viruses and genotype i viruses  . three conserved yet functionally important regions of denv- <dig> e were observed: the twelve disulfide bond-forming cysteine residues; the glycine-rich fusion domain ; and two glycosylated asparagines at position asn- <dig> and asn- <dig>   <cit> . out of  <dig> amino acid substitutions observed, only  <dig>  resulted in polarity changes . these non-conservative substitutions were found mostly in domain i , followed by domain ii  and domain iii , suggesting that domain i may be less functionally critical than domain ii and domain iii  <cit> . the individual functional effect of each conservative amino acid substitution may be unnoticeable or relatively smaller than those of non-conservative substitutions, but the cumulative effects of two or more neighboring conservative substitutions at the three-dimensional space could be important for the proper protein function.

in this study, we noted that the non-conservative amino acid substitutions e120k  and g157e/d  differentiated the three endemic genotypes from the ancestral sylvatic group. several other amino acid substitutions gave rise to additional three endemic genotypes . within genotype i, two non-conservative amino acid substitutions p305s  and n390s  were identified in the  <dig> viruses when compared against the  <dig> viruses. no non-conservative amino acid substitution was observed between the viruses from  <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks. the decreasing number of amino acid substitution among the genotype i viruses from  <dig> to  <dig> could suggest that the viruses may have reached a point where all of the non-conservative amino acid substitutions were deleterious.

within genotype ii, two non-conservative amino acid substitutions d157e and t161i in domain i further differentiated the viruses into the clade iia and iib. temporal analysis of amino acid substitution was not performed for the clade iia and iib viruses due to their similar emergence time during the  <dig> outbreak. whereas within genotype iii, two non-conservative amino acid substitutions l305s  and m272t  were found between clade iiia and iiib. the m272t substitution located at the “kl” β-hairpin region . this “kl” β-hairpin is a ph-dependent hinge region involved in the fusion-activating conformational change  <cit> . therefore, any non-synonymous mutation in the “kl” β-hairpin region could affect virus replication by altering the fusion ph threshold resulting in inefficient virus replication  <cit> . this could help explain the rapid extinction of the genotype iii virus as the virus could not be efficiently propagated.

selection pressure analyses of viral e gene collectively found  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  negatively selected sites within the malaysian isolates, the genotype i, ii and iii isolates, respectively. no positively selected codon site was noted within the malaysian isolates and within each of the genotypes. all observed amino acid substitutions in malaysian denv- <dig> e gene consensuses  were found to be under negative selection except at the codon  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which had no evidence of either negative or positive selection but probably happened through neutral genetic drift. based on the bayesian inference, the evolutionary rates of denv- <dig> e gene were estimated to be  <dig>  × 10-4- <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions/site/year. the evolutionary rates of denv- <dig> e gene did not differ substantially from those of other denv serotypes   <cit> . these rates, however, were relatively lower than those of non-vector-borne rna viruses  such as influenza viruses and hiv  <cit> . the denv- <dig> evolution in malaysia was probably constrained by purifying selection  <cit> .

the cross-neutralizing capacity of convalescent patient serum samples from  <dig>  and  <dig>  outbreaks were evaluated against viruses from seven clades: ia , ib , ic , iia , iib , iiia  and sylvatic group  . the neutralization titers of ib sera against genotype i viruses  were higher than those of ic, iia and iib sera . all sera had frnt <dig> =  <dig> against genotype ii and iiia viruses except ic sera, which showed frnt <dig> =  <dig> against the genotype iib and iiia viruses. the neutralization titers of the iia sera against sylvatic virus  were lower than those of ib, ic and iib sera . overall, all viruses were neutralized by pooled sera from the  <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks with neutralization titers ranging from frnt <dig> = 80– <dig>  interserotypic interaction of denv- <dig> patient’s sera with other denv serotypes, however, is not available in this study to rule out any possible cross-reactivity among them. results presented here suggested that there was no apparent immunological advantage accorded by the new amino acid substitutions for the virus in countering the homotypic human herd immunity. therefore, the availability of a new susceptible human population may be obligatory for denv- <dig> to initiate a new outbreak.

a neutralization titer was defined as an 80% reduction in the foci reduction neutralization test .

b serum sample from clade ia is not available.

c control treated with serum from healthy  donors.

the human herd immunity developed after the denv- <dig> outbreak could suppress the horizontal transmission of virus to human population by infected mosquito  <cit> . this could restrict the virus to continue to exist only in mosquito population through vertical transmission  <cit> . the population dynamics of mosquito over time, however, are mainly fluctuated by the stochastic environmental factors and the intermittent vector control measures  <cit> . this could repeatedly cause virus population bottlenecks  which favor the amino acid substitutions by genetic drift over those by natural selection  <cit> . even if the positively selected substitutions are advantageous, it could be randomly lost over time due to the bottleneck effect. by contrast, the neutral substitutions could be easily fixed in small virus population over time by chance  <cit> . in our study, six codons with observed amino acid substitutions in denv- <dig> e gene consensuses were under neutral genetic drift.

our results suggest that the denv- <dig> evolution in recurring outbreak in malaysia is likely to be a stochastic phenomenon, possibly driven by both negative selection and genetic drift  <cit> . whether the observed amino acid substitutions would cause enhanced virus replication in mosquito or human requires further investigation. during the inter-epidemic period, the increased viral fitness, however, may have no potential epidemic impact due to the human herd immunity that broadly cross-neutralized among different denv- <dig> genotypes. phylogenetic analysis in this study revealed that the emergences of clade iib  and clade ic viruses  were detected as early as in  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the reason why these viruses did not cause outbreak when they were first encountered could be due to the presence in the population of cross-neutralizing immunity accorded by other denv- <dig> genotypes. the cyclical pattern of recurring denv- <dig> outbreaks in malaysia suggests that a lag period of 7–10 years after the old denv- <dig> outbreak would be required for a newly evolved virus to initiate another homotypic outbreak. during this period, an increasing number of new susceptible human hosts may gradually break down the human herd immunity below the protective threshold, thus allowing the restoration of virus horizontal transmission cycle in human population. this suggests the possibility that it is not always the fittest, but the fortuitous denv- <dig> would be selected to be the clade replacement candidate which would initiate the next outbreak. and this could occur when the ecological situation favors the virus transmission. the appearances of rare isolates such as d <dig> malaysia.92844/ <dig>  d <dig> malaysia.10837/ <dig>  d <dig> malaysia.32581/ <dig>  d <dig> malaysia.32858/ <dig> and d <dig> malaysia.296236/ <dig>  could represent the potential clade replacement candidates for the future major outbreaks.

the present study is limited by working only with the viral e gene, such that evolutionary pressures on other gene regions will be missed. also, during the inter-epidemic periods between the homotypic outbreaks, the available sample set selected for sequencing is limited. this leaves gaps in understanding the extinction and emergence of the different clades. thirdly, the interserotypic interaction between the denv- <dig> with other co-circulating virus serotypes is not addressed in this study. this is important as the interserotypic immune reaction could account for the alternating epidemic pattern of denv serotypes in endemic regions. the cross-neutralization assay in this study is within the limitation where the possible cross-reactivity between different denv serotypes was not examined. this was due to the unavailability of sufficient convalescent sera from dengue patients since the study was using retrospectively collected sera. as such further studies which will include early convalescent serum from denv- <dig>  denv- <dig> or denv- <dig> infection is desirable. another limitation of the present study is that the immune responses of patients were averaged in the pooled sera; the neutralizing capacity of each serum might vary depending on the time of blood collection and genetic background of patients. notwithstanding the limitation of the study, findings from the study provide opportunities to understand the possible mechanisms driving to cyclical pattern of major dengue outbreaks in endemic regions.

CONCLUSIONS
denv- <dig> clade replacement is associated with the recurring major denv- <dig> outbreaks in malaysia. our findings from selection pressure analyses and neutralization assays are consistent with earlier studies  <cit>  suggesting that virus clade replacement is stochastic rather than driven by positive selection.
