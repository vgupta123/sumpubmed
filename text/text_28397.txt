BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells  are derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos; they are amenable to manipulation, enrichment and expansion and retain the developmental potency of embryonic founder cells, being able to differentiate into cells and tissues of all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . for these characteristics, escs represent an invaluable source of different cell types, thus opening up new possibilities for cell therapy. the understanding of the transcriptional regulatory networks that operate in escs is fundamental to unravel the molecular basis of pluripotency, self-renewal and reprogramming. the complexity of this regulatory network was highlighted by the identification of hundreds of genes, targets of the esc master genes oct3/ <dig>  nanog and sox <dig>  <cit> . in addition to these master regulatory factors, several other transcription factors play important roles in the control of this regulatory network  <cit> , such as krüppel-like factors .

klfs belong to the sp <dig> family of transcription factors with over  <dig> members  <cit> . three members of this family  are expressed in undifferentiated mouse escs and downregulated during early stages of differentiation  <cit> . klf <dig> is one of the original "yamanaka factors" required to reprogram somatic cells to a pluripotent state  <cit> , and klf <dig> and klf <dig> are able to substitute for klf <dig> function in the reprogramming, including cocktail  <cit> . it has been proposed that klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> have redundant functions because the impairment in the esc undifferentiated state was only observed following knockdown  of all these three genes  <cit> . nevertheless, there is evidence that klf <dig> has unique functions: we have recently shown that kd of klf <dig> induces esc differentiation, whereas its ectopic expression is able to maintain esc pluripotency in absence of leukemia inhibitory factor   <cit>  and klf5-knockout  mice show developmental defects at the blastocyst stage  <cit> , thus suggesting a specific requirement of this klf in early embryogenesis and in turn a high hierarchical role in the transcriptional network. opposite to other transcription factors regulating esc pluripotency and the first step of embryo development, klfs are also expressed in adult terminally differentiated cells  <cit> . klf <dig> is expressed in skin, intestinal crypts, stomach, lung, testis, uterus, heart and kidney  <cit> . we systematically explored klf5-specific targets in mouse escs by matching gene expression profiling with chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with parallel short tag-based sequencing  that identifies all klf <dig> genome binding sites. here we report that klf <dig> regulates at least  <dig> genes functioning as a repressor or activator. a total of  <dig> of  <dig> genes bear at least one binding site for klf <dig> within  <dig> kb from the gene boundaries, indicating that they can be considered klf <dig> primary targets. we first demonstrated that suppression or ectopic expression of some klf <dig> targets strongly affects the esc undifferentiated state, thus further supporting a high hierarchical role of this transcription factor in escs. then we addressed the specificity of klf <dig> function in escs by demonstrating that klf <dig> and klf <dig> have nonredundant roles and that klf <dig> targets in escs are different from the gene targets of this transcription factor in adult differentiated cells.

RESULTS
identification of klf <dig> direct targets
to identify genes directly regulated by klf <dig>  we first analyzed the transcriptome changes upon klf <dig> kd in escs by microarray analysis. to minimize indirect effects due to phenotypic changes induced by klf <dig> kd, we performed a time course analysis both by qpcr and by western blot analysis, which showed that klf <dig> expression is significantly decreased already  <dig> hr after sirna transfection . on the contrary, the expression of stemness genes such as oct3/ <dig> and nanog, previously demonstrated to be modified by klf <dig> kd  <cit> , is still unaffected at  <dig> hr . therefore, it is possible to capture early effects on transcriptome following klf <dig> kd at  <dig> hr after transfection.

statistically significant probes  were classified as upregulated and downregulated following klf <dig> kd by using as cut-off >  <dig> - and <  <dig> -fold changes, respectively. on the basis of these constraints, we identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes .

these predicted genes encode a set of proteins involved mainly in development and differentiation , in agreement with the klf <dig> role in escs and embryonic development  <cit> . interestingly,  <dig> genes controlled by klf <dig> encode regulators of transcription, indicating that klf <dig> regulates many transcription factors, which in turn regulate their downstream targets. moreover, among the genes regulated by klf <dig>  there are factors that have already demonstrated a role in esc pluripotency, such as tcl <dig>  <cit> , bmp <dig>  <cit> , nr0b <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . we also compared our results with available data  <cit> , and we found that  <dig> of  <dig> transcripts showed the same behavior upon klf <dig> kd and upon triple kd of klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig>  <cit>  . moreover, we found that 75% of the transcripts showed the same trend in our analysis and in klf <dig> kd cells  <cit>  . instead, no significant correlation was found when our data were compared with the data of lif deprivation or expression of stat <dig> dominant-negative form  <cit>  .

it is reasonable to assume that klf5-regulated genes, identified by gene expression profiling, include both direct and indirect transcriptional targets. to distinguish between direct target genes and those indirectly regulated through alterations in transcriptional networks governed by klf <dig>  we employed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation . we introduced a flag-tagged klf <dig> in escs and generated two independent pools of stable clones. the levels of klf <dig> were assessed by western blot analysis with anti-klf <dig> and anti-flag antibody to detect both endogenous and exogenous klf <dig> . chromatin from these cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibody, and purified dna fragments were analyzed by direct high-throughput sequencing. we identified  <dig> putative binding sites, and among these  <dig> had an fdr lower than 5% . chip-qpcr validations were carried out on  <dig> klf5-binding sites with different numbers of chip tag counts within the defined overlap region . twelve of  <dig> target loci subjected to validation showed a significant enrichment over three independent control regions .

next, we analyzed klf5-chip target sequences with the motif-finding cisfinder software to search for over-represented motifs. the three best results were represented by cg-rich elements , in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . moreover, all three motifs contained the ctgc sequence, suggesting a putative binding site for klf <dig> 

to identify primary targets of klf <dig> among the genes regulated upon klf <dig> kd, we matched microarray and chip-seq data, and we found that the relationship between target promoter occupancy and gene expression analysis is excellent. in fact, we found  <dig> of  <dig> genes whose expression is regulated by klf <dig>  showing a klf <dig> binding site within  <dig> kb from the gene boundaries . to validate microarray data among these  <dig> klf <dig> putative primary targets, we selected  <dig> genes where klf <dig> binding sites are at various distances from gene boundaries. qpcr analysis of these genes performed upon klf <dig> kd revealed that  <dig>  of  <dig> showed the same trend observed in microarray analysis .

to gain insights into the primary targets of klf <dig>  we analyzed the expression pattern of the  <dig> validated genes , during neural differentiation of escs. klf <dig>  such as the other two esc-specific klfs, is highly expressed in undifferentiated escs, and its expression dramatically decreases when differentiation occurs . we reasoned that genes activated by klf <dig> are expected to show the same expression profile of klf <dig>  i.e., expressed in undifferentiated escs and downregulated when differentiation occurs. on the contrary, the genes that are negatively controlled by klf <dig> are expected to show an opposite expression profile, i.e., not expressed in undifferentiated escs and upregulated when differentiation occurs. as expected, almost all the genes activated by klf <dig> are expressed in escs and repressed during differentiation . on the other hand, almost all the genes that are inactive or repressed in escs, but are expressed during differentiation, appear to be negatively regulated by klf <dig> .

suppression of klf <dig> target genes impairs esc undifferentiated state
the first point we asked is that of the relevance of klf <dig> direct targets in the maintenance of esc phenotype. among the putative klf <dig> direct targets, we decided to start by analyzing  <dig> genes that were selected on the basis of validation by qpcr  and their expression profile during esc differentiation . to this aim, we selected pools of stably transfected esc clones, where the expression of these  <dig> genes was knocked down by specific shrnas. a reduction of at least 20% in transcription levels was observed after selection . the stably transfected cells were plated at clonal density and further grown for  <dig> days. the resulting colonies were stained for alkaline phosphatase  activity  and the percentage of undifferentiated and differentiated colonies was calculated. kd of klf <dig>  resulted in at least 40% decrease of ap-positive colonies compared to control shrna transfected cells . knockdown of  <dig> of  <dig> target genes analyzed resulted in a significant decrease of ap-positive colonies . to confirm that these decreases in the number of ap-positive colonies were due to an impairment of esc undifferentiated state, we measured the level of stemness markers in cells kd for these eight genes soon after selection. expression of both oct3/ <dig> and nanog was significantly reduced compared to control after knockdown of all these genes . the observed decrease in oct3/ <dig> and nanog expression corresponded to a significant increase of early differentiation markers . these results were confirmed by further independent shrnas . taken together, these results suggest that klf <dig> controls the expression of at least  <dig> of  <dig> genes required to maintain the undifferentiated state of escs.

ectopic expression of serpine <dig> impairs esc undifferentiated state
as shown above, we found many genes whose expression in escs seems to be negatively regulated by klf <dig>  two of them, serpine <dig> and runx <dig>  were selected for functional studies. their klf5-dependent regulation is confirmed by the observation that they are expressed at very low levels in undifferentiated escs. furthermore, these genes that seem to be negatively regulated by klf <dig> in undifferentiated escs showed a strong induction upon esc differentiation when klf <dig> disappeared   <cit> . thus, we investigated their effect on stemness by forced expression in undifferentiated escs. we transfected escs with expression vectors bearing flag-tagged serpine <dig> or runx <dig> ; these cells, grown at clonal density for  <dig> days, were stained to assay ap activity. alkaline phosphatase staining showed that forced expression of flag-serpine <dig> is able to induce a significant decrease in the number of undifferentiated colonies, whereas flag-runx1-transfected cells did not show a significant decrease in ap expression . to further study the effect of forced expression of serpine <dig> and runx <dig>  we measured the expression level of oct3/ <dig> and nanog. as shown in figure 3c, the expression of oct3/ <dig> was impaired upon serpine <dig> constitutive expression in escs, and also nanog showed a moderate but significant decrease, whereas no significant changes were detectable in flag-runx1-expressing cells. this decrease of oct3/ <dig> and nanog levels corresponded to a significant increase of early differentiation markers  even in the presence of lif, indicating that serpine <dig> alone is able to impair the undifferentiated state by inducing an uncontrolled differentiation.

esc-specific targets of klf5
next, we asked the question of the specificity of klf <dig>  previous works demonstrated that klf <dig> is highly expressed in skin  <cit>  and that alterations in klf <dig> expression level may affect the epidermis-differentiated phenotype  <cit> , suggesting that klf <dig> could regulate the regenerative potential of stem cells in the epidermis. we analyzed expression changes of the  <dig> qpcr-validated klf <dig> targets upon klf <dig> kd in primary keratinocytes . in fact, we found that the transcripts of six genes expressed in escs were not detectable in primary keratinocytes, both in klf <dig> kd and control cells, whereas there were  <dig> of  <dig> genes similarly regulated by klf <dig> in primary keratinocytes and escs. on the other hand,  <dig> of  <dig> genes showed opposite changes in escs versus keratinocytes, while  <dig> of  <dig> genes were regulated by klf <dig> only in escs . although the extent of klf <dig> suppression is different in escs versus keratinocytes, the comparison of expression profiles of these two cells indicated a cell type-specific gene regulation by klf <dig> 

a further aspect of the specificity of the klf5-based regulation concerns the possibility that klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> have redundant functions by binding and thus regulating common targets in escs  <cit> . to address this point, we investigated gene expression changes of the  <dig> qpcr-validated klf <dig> targets, following kd of each single klf. we transfected klf <dig> or klf <dig> sirna in escs, and  <dig> hr after transfection we found that the level of klf <dig> and klf <dig> were significantly reduced, although with different extent of kd . in these conditions, we found that only a low percentage  of examined genes showed the same trend upon kd of all these klfs . the same low percentage was observed by comparing klf5- versus klf4-regulated genes. instead, we found that the genes that showed the same behavior upon klf <dig> and klf <dig> kd represent about 40%. finally, we observed that about 45% of the genes show a klf5-specific gene regulation, different from that dependent on klf <dig> or klf <dig> kd , indicating that some redundancy could exist in the genes controlled by klf <dig> and klf <dig>  rather than klf <dig> 

discussion
in the past  <dig> years, several reports have shown klf <dig> to be an important player regulating esc self-renewal, pluripotency and embryonic development with a unique requirement of klf <dig> in inner cell mass  establishment compared to the other esc-specific klfs  <cit> . although the pivotal role of klf <dig> in esc self-renewal and icm development has been at least in part elucidated, its mechanism of action and the genes that klf <dig> controls are still not completely understood. in the present study, we analyzed klf <dig> regulatory targets in escs by comparing microarray and chip-seq analysis. we identified  <dig> klf <dig> target genes whose expression is activated by klf <dig> and  <dig> whose expression is repressed. among them, we found  <dig> genes bearing klf <dig> binding sites within  <dig> kb from the gene boundaries and that can be considered putative primary targets of klf <dig> 

we have shown that klf <dig> controls genes that play a crucial role in escs such as tcl <dig>  <cit> , bmp <dig>  <cit>  and nr0b <dig>  <cit> , and thus it may be required in escs to maintain pluripotency by activating expression of these self-renewal promoting genes and by simultaneously inhibiting expression of differentiation promoting genes such as tgfβ <dig>  <cit> , otx <dig>  pitx <dig>  <cit>  and gdnf  <cit> . to further support the role of klf <dig> in the control of regulators of the esc phenotype, we have explored the effects of the suppression of  <dig> genes target of klf <dig>  among these  <dig> genes, we identified  <dig> genes whose kd induces the loss of esc undifferentiated state even in the presence of lif. the eight identified genes encode cell adhesion molecules , two protein kinases , a growth factor binding protein , an endoplasmic reticulum protein  and two proteins with still unknown function . such a variety of molecules indicates that the ability of klf <dig> to maintain the esc undifferentiated state results from the concomitant regulation of a wide range of cellular activities. these eight genes showed the same trend of klf <dig> expression during esc differentiation and, moreover, a different transcriptional control by klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> with igfb <dig>  niban and perp responding only to klf <dig>  among these proteins, hck has been shown to be involved in gp130-mediated signaling of lif, since introduction of constitutively activated hck alleviates the requirement of escs for lif to remain undifferentiated  <cit> . our data suggest that klf <dig> is required for proper control of the expression of esc-specific genes as well as genes whose transcription seems to be induced upon esc differentiation. among the genes suppressed by klf <dig> in undifferentiated escs, we found serpine <dig>  also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig> . serpine <dig> is a downstream target of tgfβ <dig> and is induced upon esc differentiation by tgfβ <dig> stimulation  <cit> . we have found that ectopic expression of serpine <dig> resulted in an impairment of the esc phenotype by promoting the appearance of differentiation markers even in the presence of lif. this phenotype mimics the effect of klf <dig> kd as well as of klf <dig> ko escs  <cit> . although a redundant function was suggested for klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig>  <cit> , we have shown that serpine <dig> is regulated specifically by klf <dig> and not by klf <dig> and klf <dig> suppression. this specific control by klf <dig> could explain the inability of klf <dig> and klf <dig> to compensate for the loss of klf <dig> function in icm establishment.

klf <dig> has been described to play a role in various biological processes, such as the control of the stress response in the myocardium  <cit>  and the induction of somatic cell reprogramming  <cit> . furthermore, klf <dig> has many roles in regulating cell cycle, development, proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis  <cit> . interestingly, sur et al.  <cit>  described a role of klf <dig> in the regulation of the keratinocyte differentiation program and thus in the regenerative potential of stem cells in the epidermis. by investigating changes in expression profile of klf <dig> target genes both in escs and primary keratinocytes, we have found that klf <dig> may work as a repressor or activator in a context-specific manner. in fact, about half of the examined genes seem to be regulated by klf <dig> in an esc-specific manner, and in many cases the effect of klf <dig> kd in escs and primary keratinocytes was opposite. this different regulation by klf <dig> could be due to a different accessibility to transcriptional regulators as a consequence of chromatin folding and/or to the interaction with cell-specific transcriptional complexes.

recently, jiang et al.  <cit>  proposed that klf <dig> has a redundant function with klf <dig> and klf <dig> in escs. the same authors showed that there is a greater overlap between genomic binding sites of klf <dig> and klf <dig> than with klf <dig>  accordingly, we found that about 45% of the examined genes are significantly regulated by klf <dig> and klf <dig>  interestingly, we also observed that almost half of the examined genes appear to be regulated specifically by klf <dig>  this can explain the unique requirement of klf <dig> for derivation of escs and icm proper development  <cit> , in contrast to the dispensable role of klf <dig> and klf <dig> in these processes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
numerous results indicate that klf <dig> plays an important role in maintaining esc pluripotency and in governing esc fate decisions. in this work, we have explored the mechanisms through which this transcription factor regulates esc functions. we have identified a likely complete set of genes, putative primary targets of klf <dig> in escs, by comparing the early changes of the gene expression profile induced by klf <dig> kd and the results of chip-seq analysis for klf <dig> binding sites. about half of these genes seem to be regulated by klf <dig> in an esc-specific manner, and klf5-dependent gene regulation in escs appears to be different from that based on klf <dig> and klf <dig>  two other members of the krüppel-like family, previously involved in esc functions. finally, we demonstrated that suppression or constitutive expression of klf <dig> target genes clearly impair the esc undifferentiated state. these results contribute to the understanding of the regulatory role of klf <dig> in escs and suggest a high hierarchical role in these cells for this transcription factor.

next, these cdnas were cloned downstream flag-tag in the p-cba-flag vector by using hindiii and noti restriction sites.

cell culture, transfection, differentiation and alkaline phosphatase staining
e14tg2a  mouse escs were maintained on feeder-free, gelatin-coated plates in the following medium: gmem   supplemented with  <dig> mm glutamine,  <dig> u/ml penicillin/streptomycin,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids ,  <dig>  mm β-mercaptoethanol , 10% fetal bovine serum , and  <dig> u/ml leukemia inhibitory factor . neural differentiation was induced as previously described  <cit> . briefly, undifferentiated escs were trypsinized into a single-cell suspension and plated at low density  on gelatin-coated dishes in the following medium: knockout dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% knockout serum replacement ,  <dig>  mm β-mercaptoethanol ,  <dig> mm glutamine ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin/streptomycin . medium was changed on alternate days.

primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from 2-day-old swiss icr mice  and cultured as previously described  <cit> . transfections were performed  <dig> days after plating.

transfection of expression plasmids and shrna plasmids  both in escs and in primary keratinocytes were performed using lipofectamine  <dig>  following the manufacturer's instructions. to generate the stable cell lines, e14tg2a cells were transfected with shrna plasmids and recombinant clones were selected with puromycin .

for alkaline phosphatase staining, escs were cultured at clonal density . the cells were fixed in 10% cold neutral formalin buffer  for  <dig> min and then rinsed in distilled water for  <dig> min. the staining was obtained by incubation for  <dig> min at room temperature with the following staining solution:  <dig>  m tris·hcl,  <dig> % naphthol as mx-po <dig> ,  <dig> % n, n-dimethylformamide ,  <dig> % red violet lb salt .

rna isolation and qpcr
rna from escs and primary keratinocytes was isolated by using the tri reagent  and then reverse transcribed using mumlv-rt  according to the manufacturer's instructions. real-time rt-pcr was performed using prism 7900ht sequence detection system  and power sybr green pcr master mix . gene-specific primers used for amplification are listed in additional file  <dig> 

microarrays and bioinformatics analysis
total rna from escs was isolated with tri reagent  and further purified with the qiagen column kit . then samples from three independent experiments were sent to coriell genotyping and microarray center , where, after proper sample processing, crna were hybridized with the affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array .

for bioinformatics analysis, raw probe intensities for each of the hybridized microarrays were normalized to gene expression levels using the dchip algorithm  <cit> . to identify genes significantly responding in the experiment, we computed the p values and false discovery rate . a total of  <dig> probes, corresponding to  <dig> different transcripts, have been identified  that responded significantly.

preparation of cell lysates and western blot analysis
escs and primary keratinocytes were lysed in a buffer containing  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm tris·hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl, 1% triton protease inhibitor cocktail  and analyzed by western blot analysis. the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-klf <dig> , rabbit anti-nanog , mouse anti-oct3/ <dig> , mouse anti-gapdh  and mouse anti-flag . antibody-protein complexes were detected by hrp-conjugated antibodies and ecl .

chromatin immunoprecipitation
for chip-seq analysis, escs stably transfected with flag-klf <dig> were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for  <dig> min at room temperature, and formaldehyde was then inactivated by the addition of  <dig> mm glycine. then the chromatin was sonicated to an average dna fragment length of  <dig> to  <dig> bp. soluble chromatin extracts were immunoprecipitated using the mouse monoclonal anti-flag  or mouse igg  as control. then samples from two independent experiments were sent to the dna sequencing service of embl  and subjected to high-throughput sequencing with illumina genome analyzer platform .

for chip-qpcr, samples were prepared as described above. supernatant obtained without antibody was used as an input control. qpcr analyses were performed using the abi prism 7900ht sequence detection system and sybr green pcr master mix . primers used for chip-qpcr are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the amount of precipitated dna was calculated relative to the total input chromatin and expressed as the fold enrichment relative to total input according to the following formula  <cit> : fold enrichment = 2{delta}ct ×  <dig>  where {delta}ct = ct - ct, where ct refers to cycle threshold.

chip-seq bioinformatics analysis
more than  <dig> million sequences were produced and aligned to the mouse genome  masked for dna repeat by using bowtie tool version  <dig> . <dig>    <cit> . about 50% of sequences were univocally aligned, and the resulting coordinates were fed to macs software version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to detect genomic regions enriched for multiple overlapping dna fragments  that we considered as putative binding sites. false discovery rate  was estimated by macs, by comparing the peaks from anti-flag samples with those from control  at the same p value cutoff. motif analysis was performed by using cisfinder tool   <cit>  on 200-bp sequences centered at the expected binding site indicated by peak summit calculated using the macs tool. flanking sequences  <dig> bp away from the peak summit have been used as control sequences.
