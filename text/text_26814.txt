BACKGROUND
cancer occurs when cells grow out of control due to genetic mutations  <cit> . it is not a single disease, but exhibits a wide spectrum of phenotypic variations involving numerous critical genes and pathways, e.g. tgf-β, nk-κb, tnf-α that may play multiple and even opposite roles  <cit> . accordingly, a wide range of genetic mutations is involved, and the same mutations may exhibit a different impact. further elucidation of the functional link between the genetic mutations and phenotypic changes in cancer development is of central importance, but remains a challenge  <cit> . moreover, these genetic mutations disrupt the dna repair pathways, resulting in many associated non-functional mutations  <cit> .

thus, this poses a big challenge to the central goal in cancer research to identify functional and critical mutations. historically, identification has been approached starting with frequent single genes to pathways, followed by the identification of multiple gene modules. a previous study of  <dig> breast cancer samples and  <dig> colon cancer samples  <cit>  focused on individual frequent mutated genes, and identified  <dig> candidate cancer genes , but failed to identify critical infrequent mutated genes. cancer heterogeneity or insufficient tumor sample size contributed to this and complicated the efforts to distinguish the additional core mutations from the most infrequent background mutations. at the same time, both the functional “driver” mutations and the associated “passenger” mutations occur rarely; therefore, it is nearly impossible to distinguish them solely based on the frequency of individual genes  <cit> . recent reports have focused on mining the over-represented mutations in co-expressed gene sets or modules  <cit> . in one recent report, the authors hypothesized that mutations cause cancer by disrupting certain functional modules  <cit> , i.e., sets of genes involved in the same biological functions, via different combinations of infrequently mutated genes in the same module, as functionally linked genes tend to share similar mutational phenotypes  <cit> .

in this study, our principle hypothesis is that cellular networks are comprised of many functionally related modules, and that critical genomic alterations may not necessarily change expression themselves, but may affect downstream functional modules expression levels and perturb normal functionality, leading to significant phenotypic changes.

theoretically, from the network perspective, critical cancer gene disruption will cause a significant change in expression within its neighborhood and significant phenotypic changes. driver mutations are defined as having been positively selected and contributing to cancer development; but conversely passenger mutations do not confer cancer development advantage  <cit> . one crucial form of phenotypic change during cancer development that has been extensively studied is change in gene expression  <cit> . and it has been demonstrated that the pathways or modules enriched for can genes are accompanied by significant expression changes  <cit> . furthermore, some reports have identified candidate disease genes by searching through the significantly disrupted modules, which consist of their neighborhoods, using only gene expression information  <cit> . as a result, these top ranked significantly differentially expressed genes or modules represent the cancer phenotype changes, whereas upstream genomic alterations aid in locating the changing source.

thus, based on this hypothesis, in order to discover the drivers we proposed a novel network-based approach to identify the core modules exhibiting both mutation enrichment and significant expression changes. the feasibility of this hypothesis was further assessed and genotype-phenotype correlations were detected at the network modular level. we applied this approach on six cancer types  to identify the core modules and demonstrate the utility of the method to correctly identify the known drivers. furthermore, comprehensive network analyses were performed to further mine the identified driver network properties: mutations in the core modules tended to mutate the hub genes that exhibited central regulatory roles. many of them were cancer type specific and relatively functionally isolated from those found in other cancer types. only a few, reflecting the phylogenies of the six cancer types, played a general role in multiple cancer types.

RESULTS
identification of significant expression changed functional modules
the identification of the significant expression changed functional modules was conducted by integrating mrna expression, protein-protein interaction and gene ontology  function annotation . the identification process is described briefly as follows. further details are provided in the materials and methods section.

based on the go annotation, the whole genes on the expression profile were classified into several smaller go clusters, omitting the genes not present in go. the total number of go clusters in each cancer type was  <dig> –  <dig>  involving  <dig> –  <dig> genes in total, with an average size of  <dig> –  <dig> genes per cluster. for each go cluster, we built a go network that consisted of nodes representing the member genes, and the edges representing the protein interactions between the corresponding two linked genes and weighted with their co-expressed level which measured by pcc. the below analysis on the network weighted by spearman correlation is also presented and similar results can be seen in the supplementary files .

for each go network, the weighted girvan and newman  algorithm  <cit>  was applied and partitioned it into the discrete functional modules. there were totally  <dig> –  <dig> functional modules identified for all go networks for each individual dataset derived from a different cancer type, with an average size of  <dig>  -  <dig>  genes per module, which represents approximately  <dig> % -  <dig> % of the go clusters.

to search the modules that reflect an alteration between two different pathological conditions, we used the modified p-sage algorithm  <cit>  to evaluate the multi-gene differential expression levels for all modules. the modules were ranked in ascending order based on their significant differential expression levels ; thus, the top ranked modules  exhibited greater expression differences compared to the rest of the modules. for all  <dig> datasets, the top  <dig> trms  were typical with the original p-sage p values <  <dig> , and trms_ <dig> with p values <  <dig> .

reproducible specificity to cancer development of the trms
the intra-dataset reproducibility of the resultant trms was first tested using the lin <dig> dataset of colon cancer samples . we randomly split the dataset into two halves, and estimated the robustness as the average overlapping percentage of genes in the trms  that identified from both halves across  <dig> random splits. as shown in figure 2a, the overlapping percentages for these trms_100- <dig>  were approximately four times higher than those for equal amount of individual genes that identified using t-test . on one hand, we found that significant overlaps for  <dig> % split tests of trms_ <dig> and for 100% split tests of trms_ <dig> –  <dig>  whereas approximately 10–30% split tests of trgs_100- <dig> did not exhibit a significant overlap . on the other hand, after permutating the sample labels ten times, i.e., a total of  <dig>  split tests, we found that the overlapping percentages of trms with permutation  were significantly lower compared to trms , and approximately  <dig> - <dig> times higher compared to those of the trgs . both results confirmed that the identified trms captured non-random changes that are specific to cancer development and distinguishable from randomness. similar results were found in another colon cancer dataset  as well .

next, we tested inter-dataset reproducibility using two datasets of breast cancer samples with identical pathological settings but different microarray platforms . we found significant overlaps of trms_100-  <dig> from these two datasets . as shown in figure 2b, the overlapping percentages  of trms were significantly higher compared to those for trgs  and trm_ps . moreover, the overlapping percentages of trms were approximately two times the mean of overlapping percentages for trm_ps, and were significantly higher than the extreme values from the permutation tests , but were not found using trgs. these results suggested a greater stability across datasets at trms but not the single gene level and confirmed that the trms were highly reproducible and specific to cancer development across two independent datasets.

lastly, we compared the inter-dataset reproducibility with other methods. the calculations that we utilized for whole overlapping percentages from different methods were unified as the ratio between the intersection and union of the genes in the modules. as seen in figure 2c, the overlapping percentage of trms  was much higher compared to those from other methods  with the exact same datasets and a similar number of modules, and even higher than the method  for two splits of gse <dig> .

module-level enrichment of mutations in trms
in the following, we focused on the trms_ <dig> and investigated the potential link to mutations.

we first assessed if the trms_ <dig> tended to contain a greater number of mutated genes compared to lower-ranked functional modules by calculating the ratio of their percentages of mutated genes. for all ten datasets, the ratios of trms_ <dig> were slightly above one, significantly higher compared to those of trgs , but not significantly different from those of trm_ps  . we hypothesized that it was potentially caused by hub-genes that were preferred targets of mutations  <cit>  and appeared more often in the identified modules; however, they were not associated with cancer development.

alternatively, we repeated the same analyses listed above, but tested for the percentage of mutated modules  rather than mutated genes in the trms_ <dig>  interestingly, we found that the mean ratio of the percentage of mms in trms_ <dig> vs. non-trms_ <dig>  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and was significantly greater than one . in contrast, the mean ratio for trm_ps was over two times lower  and remained similar to those for mutated gene percentages in non-permutated or permutated cases . these findings were consistent for all of the cancer types that we examined in this study, suggesting that mutations were non-randomly linked to cancer development via trms, and were not necessarily dependent on the number of genes mutated in each trm.

we evaluated the sensitivity of mm enrichment score to the changes of the pathological setting within the same cancer type. we found the much smaller difference of mm enrichment scores in colon cancer  and breast cancer , both of which had same pathological settings, although different microarray platform were utilized in breast cancer. however, approximately two fold greater differences were found in non-small cell lung cancer  datasets  and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma  datasets . in each of these two cancer types, the datasets utilized different pathological settings  as well as different microarray platforms. taken together, these findings suggested that the mm enrichment scores in trms_ <dig> are reproducible and more sensitive to changes in the tumor developmental stages compared to microarray profiling methods.

informative marker of driver mutations: core modules
as we hypothesized, core modules, i.e. the modules with significant genomic and transcriptomic changes, may be more prone to containing driver mutations. to test this idea, we first analyzed the percentage and distribution of the known cancer drivers in these core modules. we used three cohorts of can-genes identified using a frequency-based approach and viewed as the most likely candidate cancer drivers in colon cancer  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> , and gliomas  <cit> . we mapped these can-genes onto these cores modules identified from five datasets of these three types of cancers.

overall, all of these three cancer types had over 50% core modules that contained at least one can-gene . in contrast, the percentages were significantly lower for non-“core modules” in the trms_ <dig> : barrier06:26%; lin07:16%; van02: 12%; and frejie04: 9%. moreover, due to few number of significant mutation enrichment in the trm_ps_ <dig>  there were even lower percentage of core modules that contained at least one can-gene in the permutation test : barrier06: <dig> %; lin07: <dig> %; van02: <dig> %; freije04: <dig> %.

most can-genes in core modules are well-known cancer drivers ; for example, apc, smad <dig> and tp <dig> for colorectal cancer  <cit>  and brca <dig> for breast cancer. moreover, it is well documented that almost all can-genes in core modules from gliomas exhibit critical alterations in the three important pathway, tp <dig> pathway , rb <dig> pathway , and pi3k/pten pathway   <cit> . these results suggest that these core modules are informative of the existence of cancer drivers. gene ontology analysis also indicates that many of these core modules are associated with cell survival and proliferation, cell cycle, metabolism, cell death or apoptosis, or response to dna damage , events that are critically relevant to the progression of cancer  <cit> .

mutated genes in core modules are hub-genes or functionally similar
given the above findings that the core modules were non-randomly associated with tumor development at both the expression and mutation levels, and were more critical cancer drivers and biological processes, we performed network analysis on the core modules to explore the properties of their mutated genes across six different cancer types.

there were a total of  <dig> mutated genes in the core modules identified from all ten datasets. as somatic mutations are not biased toward more genes in a trm, one alternative possibility is that they selectively alter certain genes with pivotal roles to the module. to investigate this further, we built a network of the mutated genes in core modules with the known protein interactions . we found that genes mutated for a greater number of cancer types tended to reside in more central part of the network, whereas those mutated for less cancer types were often found in the peripheral regions. alternatively, we also found a positive linear correlation between the closeness score  of a mutated gene and the number of cancer types . this result suggests that mutations tend to occur at hub genes with central regulatory roles.

for each cancer type, we analyzed the smaller networks formed by the mutated genes in the core modules. interestingly, for all cancer types, the networks exhibited comparable heterogeneity, clustering coefficients, and connectivity to the original network, but approximately 2– <dig> times greater centralization and higher density scores . these results indicated a greater influence from the specific hub genes for each cancer type. we listed the top hub genes mutated for ccrcc, gliomas and colon cancer in figure 4c-e, respectively. of ccrcc, one hub gene, mapk <dig>  serves as a critical component of the jnk signaling pathway, which is known to be important for ccrcc. one highly conserved modulator of this pathway, spop, is highly expressed in 99% of ccrcc samples  <cit> . no comparable strong correlation was found for colon cancer or gliomas. in contrast, two hub genes of colon cancer, smad <dig> and smad <dig>  are from the tgfβ/smad signaling pathway whose role is more established for the development of colon cancer compared to the other two cancer types. we suggested that these type-specific hub genes may reveal the specific roles of their pathways for each cancer type, as opposed to general roles in cancer development.

on the other hand, the higher density of cancer type-specific networks may imply a closer functional relationship among mutated genes in core modules from the same cancer type compared to those in different cancer types. to test this hypothesis, we generated the networks of mutated genes in core modules that identified from each of the ten cancer datasets. as expected, we found there were generally higher network relatedness scores  between the dataset networks from the same cancer type compared to different cancer types. these differences were significant for the shortest path cutoff =  <dig> , i.e., no direct interactions, compared to cutoff =  <dig> or  <dig>  presumably due to the known small world effect within biological networks. these results demonstrate that networks from the same cancer type would be functionally more closely related compared to those from different cancer types.

cancer type specific vs. general mutated genes in core modules
since different network properties were identified between the mutations in core modules with higher and lower number of cancer type , we classified these mutations into two categories: mutated genes with n >  <dig> and n < = <dig>  and further investigated them separately. note that for cancer type with two different datasets, if a mutated gene in core modules only belonged to one of them, its number of cancer type n was defined as 1/ <dig> 

we initially investigated whether the relatedness scores could be attributed to the mutated genes  in core modules specific to a certain cancer type. after the removal of genes with n >  <dig>  the remaining networks of melanoma or gliomas showed no relatedness to those of other cancer types. in contrast, lung cancer showed considerable relatedness scores  to other cancer types  comparable to their within-type relatedness . the only other cross-type non-zero relatedness was between one breast cancer dataset and one colon cancer dataset . interestingly, the two datasets from breast cancer , colon cancer , and ccrcc  exhibited relatively higher non-zero within-type relatedness, respectively. these findings indicated that type-specific mutated genes in core modules are less functionally linked to those of other cancer types except for lung cancer.

we next performed a systematic evaluation of the roles of the two kinds of mutated genes in core modules for different cancer types and the three neighbor-joining phylogenies of the six cancer types based on their network relatedness scores were derived from : the mutated genes in core modules with n >  <dig> , the mutated genes in core modules with n ≤  <dig> , and all  <dig> mutated genes in core modules  as control . interestingly, we found that the tottree and raretree were almost identical to a star-like topology in which each cancer type is about equally distant from one another. in contrast, the comtree clearly showed two more closely paired cancer types. one pair contained breast cancer and colon cancer, which is consistent in that both cancers are adenocarcinoma. the other pair contained lung cancer and melanoma. melanoma originates from neural crest cells and 10%–30% of the nsclc cells express prominent neuroendocrine features  <cit> . therefore, the comtree may reveal the shared neural features between the two cancer types. in support of this hypothesis, we also found the nearest cancer type to be gliomas, a cancer that develops in the nervous system. taken together, these results suggest that most mutated genes in the core modules specific for each cancer type are highly functionally independent, whereas those present in multiple cancer types potentially reflect a relatedness of these cancer types, e.g., similar cells of origin.

lastly, to obtain the two stable sets of mutated genes, type-specific and general mutated genes, we tested whether the number of cancer types for each mutated gene in the core modules was not random by permutated labels of tumors  <dig> times. note that in each of permutation tests, once any of these mutated genes did fall into the core modules, its number of cancer types was defined as zero. the results indicated that almost all  mutated genes in core modules passed the significance test except for five genes . of the genes that passed the permutation test, we narrowed the genes down to  <dig> outlier genes with n >  <dig>  termed general mutated genes, and  <dig> outlier genes with n ≤  <dig>  termed type-specific mutated genes  .

of the  <dig> general mutated genes, there were six tumor suppressor genes and four oncogenes, including the tp <dig> and cdkn2a found in core modules mutated in all cancer types. most of these genes are related to the well-known pathways involved in cancer development. the exceptions are three genes , which are known to play a role in neural systems, and only appear in some of the core modules from the two cancer types of neural origin, gliomas and melanoma, and nsclc that expresses prominent features of neuroendocrine cells. this finding again confirmed a closer relationship of these three cancer types in the comtree phylogeny.

of the  <dig> type-specific mutated genes, cdk <dig> has been established as a colorectal cancer oncogene that regulates beta-catenin activity  <cit>  and cdk5rap <dig> located on the melanoma-susceptibility region  <cit> . the gliomas and melanoma contained at least twice as many as the other types. particularly, the melanoma type specific mutated gene krt <dig> encodes the keratin  <dig> which belongs to a group of fibrous proteins forming the structural framework of certain cells, particularly for the skin. the gliomas type-specific mutated gene ar encodes the androgen receptor, whose role in the development of neural systems has been well established. we found that genes in this category were studied relatively less for their roles in cancer development; however, our findings here indicate a potential functional role for them in which additional studies are warranted.

discussion
in our study, we introduced a novel network-based approach to discover the driver mutations during cancer development. compared with current approaches, there are some notable features to this approach. firstly, it has successfully allowed for the detection of critical mutations despite the frequency and for identification of the responsive core modules from the perturbed pathways or gene sets, which improves the efficiency and avoids the use of irrelevant members. secondly, this method is based upon carefully constructed, high-quality molecular networks derived from hprd, literature curated, and manually screened networks. in this novel network, false positive interactions are theoretically further reduced by cutting the inter-go connections and weighting the interactions using co-expression values, as opposed to other networks which are inferred by using only the co-expression levels  <cit>  or solely literature curated networks obtained from different contexts  <cit> . additionally, our approach is based on an explicit hypothesis that phenotypic changes represented by significant transcriptomic changes respond to cancer driver mutations. unlike other methods that integrate gene expression information only to infer the modular network structures  <cit> , we also used the differentially expressed levels of the modules as a tool to screen the modules most likely influenced by drivers, to characterize those core modules, and to identify mutations enriched in the modules.

our findings demonstrated a correlation between genetic mutations and phenotypic alterations at the module level, not at the single gene level. these genotype-phenotype correlations have been conceived for a long time but were only partially probed previously in certain genes, e.g., egfr, tp <dig>  brca <dig>  brca <dig>  k-ras, and their pathways. this may indicate that while the impaired dna repair pathways seems to result in mutations widely distributed over all genes, it also causes more damage or the most responsiveness in the core modules. the presence of core modules in all six cancer types suggests the potential for a general mechanism, which supports the hypothesis that cells are modularly organized and module disruption potentially causes cancer.

furthermore, the robustness of these findings has also been demonstrated. on one hand, we compared different strategy’s impact on the results. in details, when weighting go network, we used two different co-expression level definitions, pcc and scc. we compared the results using these two different strategy and found these two strategy’s results are same or similar, including network/module properties , module robustness , and mutation enrichment level . all results together suggested the findings are stable even though using different network weight strategy. on the other hand, we also demonstrated our findings robust by analysis ten different datasets from six cancer types, which has shown consistence.

regarding the reason behind our findings about genotype-phenotype correlated changes, it may be attributed to co-evolution at network/module level. proteins perform its function by interacting with other partners in the modular mode, where modularity is deemed to affect the co-evolution on the proteins  <cit> . first, interaction proteins have been found to be co-evolved to meet the structural constraints on the binding site  <cit> . second, the member genes in the module would co-evolve to be co-opted for a new common function  <cit> . thus, protein-protein interaction information, especially the modularity, contributes to build the relationship between genotype and phenotype.

core modules provide biological insight into cancer development. firstly, core modules are useful to identify the cancer drivers, which have been demonstrated in all three cancer types in which driver mutation data are available. secondly, mutated genes in core modules tend to be hub-genes and functionally similar. closer links among mutated genes were found in core modules from the same cancer type. also, higher network relatedness was found between two different datasets from colon cancer  and ccrcc  compared to breast cancer  and nsclc . this may imply a more complex development of breast cancer and nsclc compared to colon cancer and ccrcc, or alternatively, it may be due to the heterogeneous histopathological features within their corresponding datasets. for breast cancer, samples in wang <dig>  <cit>  were lymph node-negative whereas the combination of lymph node-negative and positive were found in van <dig>  <cit> . for nsclc, sanchez <dig>  <cit>  contained primary adenocarcinomas and squamous-cell carcinomas whereas only primary adenocarcinomas were found in beer <dig>  <cit> . thirdly, for the mutated genes in the core modules from multiple cancer types, some may play a central role in cancer pathways such as tp <dig>  also, these genes’ network relativeness based cancer phylogenic relationship reflects the similar cellular origins across the different cancer types, which may be due to epigenetic factors, e.g.  common mutational mechanism pre-disposed at the early stage of differentiation for certain cell types, or  similar challenges from tumor microenvironment. this finding is also consistent with the prior findings that tissue lineages can influence mutational frequencies of certain oncogenes  <cit> .

however, there is not sufficient evidence to make conclusions regarding the causal relationship of mutations and expression changes, and many mutated genes within the core modules may only be associative. in addition, due to the public data limitation, the tumor sample sources exhibit differences between the expression profile and genomic mutation data. besides, the pathological conditions are different between different datasets even though the results have demonstrated that networks from same cancer types, whether or not with same or different pathological status, have higher network relatedness than those from different cancer types, suggesting the differences from cancer types dominated the comparison between different cancers. along with the rapidly increasing amount of data available, some aspects of our approach can be augmented by incorporating data from other dimensions, e.g., copy number variations or epigenetics, which could potentially help reduce the false positive rate and identify more explicit pathways. meanwhile, more full datasets for each patient under each pathological condition will become available in the future. the core modules revealed in this study are potentially valuable resources for the elucidation of how mutations arise, with general or specific roles in different cancer types, and provide insight into convergent cancer development in different organs, and may be informative for clinical usage as well.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the correlations between genetic and phenotypic changes were successfully detected on the core modules for all ten datasets from six cancer types. meanwhile, an effective network-based approach was proposed to identify driver mutations from core modules with convergent genotype-phenotype changes, and its utility was demonstrated. furthermore, through comprehensive network analysis on the mutated genes in core modules from these six cancer types, we found different properties between cancer type specific and general mutated genes: the majority were cancer type specific and relatively functionally isolated from those found in other cancer types; the rest were general mutated genes and tended to be the hub genes, and can reflect the phylogenetic relationship between the corresponding cancers, providing critical insights into convergent cancer development in different organs.
