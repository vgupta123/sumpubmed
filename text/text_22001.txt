BACKGROUND
systems-wide methods have become an important part of physiological research in industrial biotechnology, with the aim of improving industrially relevant production strains and processes, for example by identifying physiological reactions that limit metabolism or the production of proteins. transcriptional profiling can be particularly useful, since it can reveal previously unknown, but relevant pathways  <cit> .

chemostat and other continuous flow cultures are the technique of choice for producing biomass for global studies, such as transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiles, since parameters such as growth rate, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations can be kept constant, providing a reproducible environment and populations of cells in physiological steady state  <cit> . thus reproducible physiological studies can be carried out and single parameters can be varied while others are kept constant, increasing the reliability of systems-wide datasets. batch culture systems are also used to obtain systems-wide datasets, but because environmental conditions and growth rate are constantly changing, the interpretation of these datasets and comparison with other results is complicated  <cit> .

filamentous fungi form a notable group of cell factories that are widely exploited in the production of industrial enzymes because of their ability to produce large amounts of extracellular proteins. production of native enzymes by the fungus trichoderma reesei can exceed  <dig> g l- <dig>  <cit> . such levels of secretion, however, have not been reached for non-fungal recombinant proteins  <cit> . use of global level 'omics' technologies, coupled with continuous chemostat cultivations, as a strategy to improve productivity is thus also emerging in the fungal research community  <cit>  as the genomes of these organisms, including the one of t. reesei  <cit> , become available.

establishing chemostat cultures for filamentous fungi, however, faces particular challenges, because of their multi-nuclear, polar growth form, which introduces an inherent heterogeneity to the system. differentiation, particularly for conidia production, may further increase culture heterogeneity for some species. in addition, fungi have a greater ability than unicellular organisms to adhere to each other, forming pellets, or to grow on solid surfaces, such as the walls of the bioreactor  <cit> . the filamentous growth form increases the viscosity of the culture, causing mass transfer limitations  <cit> . as with other organisms culture evolution as a result of mutations and selection occurs  <cit> .

the quality of a chemostat steady state is generally assessed from the measurement of various process parameters such as biomass and product concentrations, co <dig> evolution and alkali consumption rates. however, short term changes in environmental conditions, for example as a result of sample removal, and poor mixing, resulting in nutrient gradients, will have an impact on cellular physiology  <cit> , but would not necessarily result in measurable changes in biomass related parameters. since cells can rapidly adapt to changing conditions by transcriptional regulation  <cit> , these perturbations may be affecting the transcriptome. however, the degree of stability of gene expression in continuous flow cultures has not been reported.

in these studies we have applied a novel transcriptional analysis method called trac   <cit>  to study expression levels of a set of  <dig> marker genes, relative to polya rna content, in chemostat cultures of a t. reesei strain producing the laccase of melanocarbus albomyces  <cit>  and its parental strain. the trac method was used to monitor transcriptional steadiness and to identify disturbances in the steady state. in addition, trac was used to assess transcriptional responses during transient periods of oxygen deprivation and subsequent recovery and during recombinant protein production.

RESULTS
gene expression stability during steady state
the stability of several physiological parameters were monitored before and after the onset of continuous medium feeding to evaluate the steady state of chemostat cultures. standard on-line  and off-line  measurements were used and are referred to as conventional process analyses. in addition to these conventional process analyses a novel method for rapid transcriptional profiling called trac  <cit>  was used to monitor the expression of appr.  <dig> marker genes.

stabilisation of gene expression occurred rapidly after the start of continuous medium feeding  in chemostats which subsequently showed good steady states . the genes analysed showed, on average, less than 20% variation from the most stable expression phase after approximately  <dig>  r , even though fss  showed that the average gene expression levels varied significantly between the batch and the continuous phase. in the batch phase, the genes analysed here showed on average a fold-change of  <dig>  –  <dig>  relative to the most stable expression phase during the chemostat culture and the average deviation in the fold change between the genes was large. the expression of secreted protein  and folding factor genes was strongly up-regulated when the culture was in transition from batch to chemostat phase, whereas, for example, glycolysis gene gpd <dig> and heat shock protein hsp <dig> gene were strongly down-regulated .

most chemostat cultures were lactose limited. in one batch culture, however, limitation of trace minerals  was applied  and the transient phase between batch and chemostat growth was further disturbed by increasing the concentrations of the trace minerals to those used in other cultures, to shift the limitation from trace minerals to lactose at  <dig>  r after the start of continuous medium feeding. the gene expression levels reached the same level of stability as was observed in lactose limited cultures in less than  <dig> r after lactose became limiting. in all cultures, the average expression levels remained constant for the next  <dig>  –  <dig> r, with a small average deviation in fss .

in stable chemostat cultures all measured parameters had become constant within  <dig> r, although different parameters required slightly different lengths of time to become constant. stabilisation of average gene expression occurred within a similar time frame as stabilisation of co <dig> and dry weight production, but one to two r earlier than required for secreted protein and enzyme concentrations .

some marker genes showed consistent variation during the steady state phase. expression of cellulases  and folding factor  was very constant in the fma predicted steady state phase, with sequential measurements generally varying less than  <dig> % from their mean. however, variation in the expression levels for the stress related genes gcn <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  the conidiation genes con <dig> and ccg <dig> and vacuolar protease vpa <dig> was 15–20%. this level of variation was detected by trac with high reliability  <cit>  and was not dependent on the fluorescence signal strength in the trac assay.

monitoring of disturbances in the steady state by trac
several fungal chemostats showed some instability during the steady state, in spite of the carefully controlled external parameters. potential disturbances in the steady state and the resulting physiological instability were most sensitively detected at the level of gene expression. figure  <dig> illustrates three representative chemostat cultures , in which instabilities occurred due to a technical disturbance , an unknown effector  or a biological factor . instabilities were detected either as a change in gene expression and in conventionally monitored parameters  or as a change in gene expression only .

in culture iv  a disturbance occurred between  <dig>  and  <dig>  r as a result of a failure in the antifoam control. the concentration of polypropylene glycol increased 9-fold above the normal concentration causing an apparent increase in biomass concentration and a decrease in extracellular protein and enzyme concentrations. at the transcriptional level the disturbance was observed as a small increase in the average fold-change of expression of the gene set used , compared to the fma predicted steady state. the deviation from the steady state was primarily caused by down-regulation of two main cellulases , protein chaperon , ribosomal protein mrna  and chitin synthase  .

in another culture , a number of genes showed a significant response to an unknown effector, while other physiological parameters were constant. genes coding for extracellular enzymes were down-regulated together with a protein folding factor , while up-regulation was observed for some stress related markers , conidation genes  and alkaline extracellular protease .

in high density chemostat cultures, with cell dry weight 4-fold higher than in the standard culture conditions, steady states were achieved in a similar time frame to the lower biomass cultures, based on all the measured parameters. however, in cultures with high biomass a large change in expression occurred for several of the gene markers after  <dig> to  <dig> r . the disturbance in the steady state was less evident in the conventional process measurements, although a small increase in biomass concentration and a 50% decrease in the cellobiohydrolase concentration did occur . the gene markers which showed down regulation after  <dig> r in the high biomass culture  were the same as in other cultures which showed disturbances  i.e. cellulases and folding factors. in high biomass cultures, up-regulation was consistently observed for stress related genes , central carbohydrate metabolism genes  and ribosomal protein genes.

monitoring transcriptional responses to anaerobic phases
we studied by marker gene expression analysis the physiological responses to fluctuation in oxygen availability and recovery of the cultures from such perturbations by exposing t. reesei cultures to anaerobic conditions. in several fungal chemostat cultures the steady state was disturbed after approximately  <dig> r by making the conditions anaerobic for  <dig> to  <dig> min. replacing the air supply with n <dig> caused an immediate drop of dissolved and off-gas o <dig> levels to 0% .

approximately  <dig> % of the marker genes showed greater than  <dig> -fold change in expression level in response to anaerobic conditions. the longer the anaerobic phase, the stronger the effect for the set of genes analysed . however, recovery of the initial expression levels was quick after aeration of the culture was restarted. in  <dig> to  <dig> h after restoring aerobic conditions the expression of these genes showed less than  <dig> -fold variation on average, from the initial steady state expression level and the expression levels remained constant for the next  <dig> to  <dig> h.

four different expression patterns were observed for gene markers that showed a response to sudden changes in availability of o <dig> . the most sensitive markers to lack of oxygen availability were hsp <dig> and hem <dig> . both of these genes were strongly induced during anaerobiosis, and immediately repressed after aerobic conditions were restored, returning the previous, aerobic expression levels within less than  <dig> h.

the amino acid permease gene gap <dig> showed little or no response to the anaerobic conditions, but showed 5–8-fold induction  <dig> min after restoring aeration . the genes gpd <dig> and acs <dig>  involved in central carbohydrate metabolism, also showed induced expression during the transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions . these genes only returned to the previous steady state after 5– <dig> h. when cultures were starved of carbon for  <dig> min, gap <dig> was induced. it was then down-regulated after medium feed was restarted .

ribosomal protein and chitin synthase gene  expression levels decreased during anaerobiosis and also during lactose starvation. the average mrna half life  for these genes was shorter during lactose starvation  than anaerobic conditions  with ribosomal protein mrnas having 15–40% shorter t1/ <dig> than chs <dig>  up-regulation to previous steady state expression level occurred after the restoration of aeration .

the genes for secreted cellulases, cbh <dig> and egl <dig>  and the protein folding factor gene, pdi <dig>  which had been observed to be down-regulated in various process disturbances , were also down-regulated  by anaerobiosis, along with the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase  gene . these genes slowly recovered their previous expression levels after restoration of aerobic conditions. the specific activity of cbh and eg  decreased  <dig> to 30% in anaerobic conditions, but increased to the previous activities once aerobic conditions were restored . in contrast, during  <dig> min lactose starvation expression of these genes did not change and they were up-regulated after medium feed was restarted. .

to determine whether the responses described above were specific for anaerobiosis and subsequent restoration of aeration or due to the accumulation of substrate or other metabolites during the anaerobiosis, chemostat cultures were also carried out in which the medium feed was stopped with or without simultaneous termination of air feed . the effect of anaerobic conditions was the same, regardless of whether the culture was starved of lactose or had excess of lactose . the transcriptional response to oxygen starvation was different than the response to lactose starvation for all genes except the ribosomal protein and chitin synthase genes , and thus for the other genes observed response was specific for lack of oxygen.

comparison of marker gene expression between a recombinant and the parental strain
one of the aims in our studies was to address the physiological effects of foreign protein production to the cell. for focused and genome-wide expression comparison, using transcriptional stability  as a decisive criterion, the most stable cultures among those cultures assessed as being in steady state based on conventional process analyses were selected. figure  <dig> gives a comparison of marker gene expression between t. reesei rutc- <dig> and the m. albomyces laccase producing strain during steady state in lactose limited chemostat cultures at d =  <dig>  h- <dig>  results of the genome-wide analysis will be published elsewhere.

expression of each marker gene was averaged over  <dig> samples during the fma-predicted steady state from triplicate cultures. out of approximately  <dig> marker genes, only  <dig> showed significant difference in expression  between the two strains . gene expression of native secreted cellulases cbh <dig> and egl <dig> were down-regulated in the recombinant strain by  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold respectively. another cellulase, intracellular β-glucosidase  <dig>  showed a smaller  <dig> -fold down regulation in the recombinant laccase producing strain, compared to the host strain. the reduced expression levels corresponded with the observed  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold lower specific extracellular activities for cbh and eg, respectively . the unfolded protein response   and trafficking related  genes were moderately down-regulated in the recombinant strain.

only one gene in the gene set analysed, coding for protein chaperon hsp <dig>  was up-regulated in the recombinant strain. the expression level of this gene showed considerable variation between the triplicate cultures of the same strain, and the observed variation may therefore be partly culture dependent.

discussion
in this study we addressed the quality of a large number of chemostat cultures performed with trichoderma reesei. this was done by conventional process analysis and by a novel transcriptional analysis method trac that allows measurement of multiple mrna levels in a large number of samples.

to achieve a physiological steady state in chemostat cultures with filamentous fungi can be considered as challenging due to various factors causing inhomogeneity to the culture . consistent with this, only in some of the t. reesei chemostat cultures performed in this work good physiological steady states were observed, based on the stability of all measured parameters . in these cultures, monitoring of marker genes showed that most transcripts had reached their steady state expression level  within less than  <dig> generation of the onset of continuous medium flow and that expression levels remained constant for the following  <dig> to  <dig> generations or until the culture was terminated or deliberately perturbed. cultures, chosen by trac for comparison of the two strains, showed a high degree of reproducibility during the steady state . the average variation between parallel trac measurements has been show to be approximately 9%  <cit> .

steady states were not obtained in all cultures, nor were the reasons for this always apparent. instabilities were always evident at the level of transcription, but were not always detectable in the conventional process analyses. the changes observed at the transcriptional level indicated that some undetected perturbation in the environmental conditions had occurred. microorganisms are able to rapidly adjust their internal physiology to variable conditions  <cit> , and adjustment of genetic expression is expected to be among the earliest detected changes in cellular physiology in response to environmental perturbations. monitoring of relevant marker genes will also give an indication as to the source of perturbation.

in chemostat cultures with t. reesei, the most sensitive markers for process disturbances were the genes coding for hydrolytic enzymes , which were consistently down-regulated in response to various factors like high concentrations of polypropylene glycol, lack of aeration or high cell density stress. this observation has special importance, since these enzymes are the major products of t. reesei in industrial production, and the cbh <dig> promoter is widely used to drive expression of foreign proteins. the down-regulation of secreted enzyme genes was accompanied by down-regulation of upr-related folding factors . the co-regulation of these two gene groups has been observed earlier  <cit> . down-regulation of cbh <dig> and egl <dig> was also reflected in subsequent reduction in the corresponding enzyme activity . the t. reesei cultures clearly respond to several stress conditions at the expense of protein production and secretion.

expression of genes coding for conidiation related  and ribosomal proteins  was also sensitive to process disturbances. reduced transcription of ribosomal protein mrnas has also been observed in yeast under various stress conditions, such as nutrient starvation, protein secretion stress and osmotic stress  <cit> . since ribosomal rna genes make up a considerable fraction of the entire genome, the reduced synthesis of rrna and ribosomal protein transcripts and of the ribosomes may help to save energy while the cells adapt to changing conditions  <cit> . in rapidly growing cells the expression of ribosomal protein mrna is, by contrast, strongly induced  <cit> .

con <dig> encodes a short protein that is homologous to neurospora crassa conidiation specific gene  <dig>  n. crassa con <dig> is expressed during the formation of asexual conidia , but is not expressed in mycelium  <cit> . chitin synthase  has a role in cell wall biogenesis and is required for formation of conidia in n. crassa  <cit> . these conidiation related genes showed relatively high instability during non-disturbed as well as disturbed chemostat cultures. high levels of conidiation were observed in several of the cultures that did not attain steady state  and variation in the expression of these genes during steady states could reflect a need to continually adjust the balance between filamentous growth and conidium formation, in order to maintain constant biomass in the chemostat.

in high cell density t. reesei chemostat cultures after  <dig> to  <dig> r several of the marker genes showed a significant fold-change, relative to their expression levels during the most stable expression phase . the up-regulation of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene tps <dig> and repression of the trehalase gene nth <dig> suggested that trehalose synthesis occurred in the high biomass t. reesei cultures, as has been observed in s. cerevisiae when grown in high substrate concentrations  <cit> . up-regulation of the carhohydrate metabolism genes  in t. reesei indicated elevated glycolytic flux and higher energy demand  <cit> . hem <dig> and/or hsp <dig> genes were induced after  <dig> r in the high cell density cultures , possibly indicating limitation in oxygen availability, since regulation of these genes was also observed to be oxygen dependent . the increase in transcription factor gcn <dig> mrna could suggest an amino acid starvation response  <cit> . unexpected increase in biomass concentration was observed, which could be connected to up-regulation of ribosomal protein mrnas .

when the steady states of the fungal cultures were deliberately disturbed by exposing them to anaerobic conditions for  <dig>  –  <dig> h, the return of transcript levels of affected genes to their previous level was surprisingly rapid once aeration of the culture was restarted. within  <dig> h of restarting aeration the expression of the genes were at the previous steady state levels. although t. reesei is not able to grow in anaerobic conditions, it sustained metabolic activity surprisingly well without oxygen. short term deprivation of oxygen level to the culture did trigger physiological responses, but t. reesei recovered in relatively short time from even  <dig> h of total anaerobiosis  and no signs of cell lysis were observed . bonaccorsi et al.  <cit>  observed a similar restoration of gene expression in t. reesei qm <dig> within  <dig> h following a  <dig> h period in anaerobic conditions at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> with glucose as the carbon source. bonaccorsi et al.  <cit>  monitored  <dig> genes,  <dig>  % of which were affected by oxygen concentration, but did not confirm steady state expression levels, as was possible here using trac with a smaller number of genes. along with medium composition, the exchange of gasses is a critical parameter in industrial fermentation processes  <cit> . in large scale fermentations with a thick filamentous slurry, inhomogeneity of the system leads to local limitations in oxygen supply  <cit> . as with other process disturbances, the cellulase genes were repressed during oxygen deficiency , as has previously been observed for cbh <dig> and egl <dig>  <cit> . this is a crucial factor considering the productivity of the t. reesei production process.

genes coding for coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase  and heat shock protein  <dig>  were the most sensitive markers among the genes assessed here for availability of o <dig>  coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase is involved in heme biosynthesis. heme functions in yeast as an oxygen sensor by regulating the activity of transcription factor hap <dig>  heme permits hap <dig> to be released from a high-molecular-weight complex  in the presence of oxygen, and hap <dig> subsequently activates transcription of aerobic genes and represses expression of anaerobic genes by repressing rox <dig> activity  <cit> . the absence of oxygen induces the expression of half of the heme biosynthesis genes in s. cerevisiae, with the hem <dig> homologue hem <dig> showing the strongest up-regulation, even though heme cannot be synthesised in anaerobic conditions  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae ssa type hsp <dig> proteins have been shown to be a part of the hmc  <cit>  and to be involved in activation of anaerobic genes via the binding of hap1p in the absence of heme. the o <dig> dependent regulation of the t. reesei ssa homologue hsp <dig> shown here, may thus reflect its role in the regulation of hap <dig> activity.

inhibition of growth by either lack of lactose or of oxygen resulted in down-regulation of ribosomal protein and chitin synthase genes as expected. rapid up-regulation to previous expression level was observed after restoring previous steady state conditions. yeast ribosomal protein mrnas decline in mild heat shock with t1/ <dig> of 5– <dig> min  <cit> , which was much faster than the turn-over times observed in this work for two t. reesei ribosomal protein mrnas under lactose starvation  or anaerobiosis . the rapid increase  in chs <dig> and ribosomal protein mrna levels when culture again became aerobic was consistent with the observation that cell density had not decreased during the short term anaerobiosis. the rapid and strong up-regulation of aminoacid permease may also be part of the quick adaptation of the culture to growth conditions .

trac analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of the marker genes were very similar for rutc- <dig> and the strain producing recombinant laccase, with only few exceptions . down-regulation of native endo- and exoglucanases  was observed in the recombinant strain, corresponding to the lower specific production of these enzymes . this could be due to repression of the genes by the ress mechanism , even though no unfolded protein response  was observed. another possible explanation could be that the cellulase genes were down-regulated due to titration of their activating transcription factors  <cit> . this idea, however, is questioned by the fact that the laccase expression construct is present in the analysed strain as a single copy .

transcriptional monitoring of chemostat cultures is beneficial prior to costly and laborious systems-wide analyses in order to increase their reliability by ensuring that samples from only reproducible cultures are analysed. in addition to offering a high degree of reproducibility, trac also has the advantage of allowing simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples, in a cost effective, time efficient manner. therefore, in addition to monitoring of transcriptional stability, trac is well suited for analysis of gene expression dynamics in experiments involving transients.

CONCLUSIONS
we have analysed the expression stability of approximately  <dig> marker genes in a large number of chemostat cultures of the filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei, using the novel transcriptional analysis method trac. we have demonstrated that gene expression levels were stable in those chemostat cultures showing good physiological steady states. instabilities in the chemostat cultures were always detected at the level of transcription, but were not always detectable by conventional process analyses. various disturbances, as well as expression of a recombinant laccase, were particularly manifest by the down-regulation of genes coding for the hydrolytic enzymes, which are the major industrial products of t. reesei. deliberate exposure of the t. reesei chemostat cultures to transient anaerobic phases, revealed that the fungus was able regain previous steady state expression levels rapidly once aeration was restarted. this study demonstrates the usefulness of trac in transcriptional analysis of transient conditions, as well as ensuring the quality of chemostat cultures prior to systems-wide analysis.
