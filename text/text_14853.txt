BACKGROUND
as of december  <dig>  there were approximately  <dig>  million cattle in the uk  <cit> . it is estimated that low fertility and suboptimal management of dairy herds cost £ <dig> million in lost productivity annually  <cit> . this problem is currently maintained by the chronic selection and use of high-yielding dairy cows. profitable milk production depends on regular calving, the target being that every cow produces one calf a year. an important limitation to meeting this target is that, although conception rates remain very low , tools for accurate early detection of pregnancy  are not available leading to prolonged inter-calving intervals and significant losses in milk production. in light of this, the veterinary and dairy sectors have a particular interest in the development of novel biomarkers of early pregnancy.

micrornas  have recently emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers with high clinical potential. mirnas are short, non-coding rna molecules which are centrally involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression  <cit> . different roles of mirnas in the reproductive system have been proposed including the development of ovarian follicles and the corpus luteum  <cit> , uterine cyclicity and establishment of pregnancy, and embryonic development . in the early developing bovine conceptus, the levels of some mirnas including mir- <dig> and mir-125a vary greatly suggesting a role in the maternal-to-zygotic transcriptional transition  <cit> . furthermore, several mirnas including mir-27a and mir-92b are differentially expressed during the development of the placenta, where they have been associated with trophoblast differentiation and vascularisation  <cit> . finally, let- <dig> and mir-125b among other mirnas have been shown to control mammary gland development and lactation  <cit> .

mirnas are naturally secreted from cells into body fluids where they remain in relatively stable protein or lipid complexes and can be easily quantified . this, combined with the fact that some mirnas are tissue or developmental stage specific presents the opportunity to use mirnas as non-invasive biomarkers of tissue function associated with a variety of physiological states  and diseases   <cit> . indeed, mirna-based platforms are currently being used for clinical diagnosis of various types of human cancer  <cit> . despite this, there are still limitations associated with measurement of circulating mirna levels using existing technologies, which are derived from the presence of enzymatic inhibitors in serum and plasma, the low rna content in bio-fluids, haemolysis and other cell contamination, and the need for unbiased procedures for normalisation of mirna expression data  <cit> .

there is promising evidence of the potential of mirnas as biomarkers of pregnancy. the circulating levels of mirnas belonging to the primate- and placenta-specific c19mc cluster increase with gestational age, while levels of c14mc cluster mirnas increase in the first trimester and decrease in later pregnancy  <cit> . furthermore, the c19mc cluster mirnas, mir-516-5p, mir-518b, mir-520a and mir- <dig>  are detectable in the human maternal circulation as early as 12 weeks of gestation  <cit> . in addition, the circulating levels of some c19mc mirnas are significantly correlated with placental weight  <cit> , consistent with their secretion from the developing placenta. recent studies in humans have also identified mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as pregnancy-associated circulating mirnas; circulating levels of mir- <dig> significantly increase during gestation whereas the levels of both mirnas decrease after delivery  <cit> . in sheep, mir-30c, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-199a-3p and mir- <dig> are differentially expressed in serum on days  <dig> or  <dig> of pregnancy  <cit> . there is limited information on pregnancy-related mirnas in livestock and, to our knowledge, the levels of circulating mirnas during early pregnancy have not been previously published for any domestic species.

the aim of this study was to profile mirna levels in the plasma of cattle during days  <dig> and  <dig> of pregnancy and to identify mirna signatures that could be potentially used for diagnosis of early pregnancy. we present mirna profiling results generated using two independent approaches, illumina small-rna sequencing and qiagen pcr array.

RESULTS
optimisation of bovine plasma mirna profiling
we deemed it important to introduce sample quality control measures and optimise our quantification methodology before proceeding with profiling mirnas in the bovine circulation, in order to address common problems in circulating mirna quantification which might bias our study, such as low rna yields, enzymatic inhibition and haemolysis.

we tested three different commercial kits for extraction of rna from bovine plasma, namely, mirneasy mini , mirneasy plasma , and trizol ls . using 200 μl of bovine plasma, the trizol ls protocol was more efficient than the column-based kits as determined by rt-qpcr quantification of spiked-in exogenous cel-mir-39-3p . an added advantage of the trizol ls protocol is that it allows scaling-up the extraction volume; for our experiments we decided to use  <dig>  ml of bovine plasma which yielded a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng of rna . this yield is similar to that reported for bovine plasma in another study , but lower than the mean yield reported for human plasma   <cit> .fig.  <dig> optimisation of methodology for profiling mirnas in bovine plasma. a rt-qpcr data plots  showing abundance of the exogenous mirna, cel-mir-39-3p, in plasma samples after rna extraction using  <dig> different kits as indicated. b rna yield from  <dig>  ml bovine plasma samples using trizol ls. c results of rt-qpcr quantification of mir- <dig> in plasma  using different rna volumes for reverse-transcription; highest reaction efficiency was obtained using 2 μl of rna in a 10 μl cdna synthesis reaction



the presence of high levels of enzyme inhibitors in plasma samples  can significantly reduce the efficiency of rt-qpcr  <cit> . to address this, we tested different input rna volumes and determined that using 2 μl of rna extract in a 10 μl cdna synthesis reaction yielded the highest reaction efficiency .

another significant problem in plasma mirna profiling is red blood cell contamination. as high levels of red blood cell-derived mirnas such as mir- <dig> are associated with haemolysis  <cit> , the Δcq between mir- <dig> and mir-23a has been proposed as a useful indicator of haemolysis  <cit> . we confirmed the validity of this approach for bovine samples by showing good correlation between the ratio of mir- <dig> and mir-23a and optical densities at 414 nm . based on this, we concluded that all samples used for mirna profiling were within the normal range for non-haemolysed bovine plasma .

illumina small-rna sequencing of bovine plasma
we sequenced a total of  <dig> small rna libraries generated from plasma samples collected from eight non-pregnant animals , and  <dig> animals on each of days  <dig> and  <dig> of pregnancy .

we obtained a median of  <dig>  million raw sequencing reads from each sample . a length distribution plot of reads post-trimming showed a distinct peak at 20– <dig> nucleotides indicating the majority of reads corresponded to mature mirnas . after removal of low-quality reads, a median of  <dig> million reads  from each sample were mapped to the bovine genome, 68 % of which  were identified as mirnas . the remaining mapped reads corresponded to non-coding regulatory and structural small rnas including y-rnas and spliceosomal rnas, and fragments of larger rna species such as mrnas . the vast majority of mirna reads  corresponded to registered bovine sequences in mirbase; the remaining corresponded to human mirna homologues  or to predicted novel mirnas . the percentage of mirna reads obtained over the total sequencing reads  was higher than that reported from sequencing of bovine plasma in another study  but lower than obtained from human plasma using the same sequencing platform   <cit> .table  <dig> summary of results from small-rna sequencing analyses

overall, a total of  <dig> unique mirnas across all individual samples  had more than  <dig> read counts. on average, the  <dig> most abundant mirnas accounted for 61 % of the total mirna reads in each sample . out of the most abundant mirnas in bovine plasma, mir- <dig> and mir-92a are reportedly expressed primarily in erythrocytes, and mir- <dig> is expressed primarily in platelets  <cit> . almost half  of the  <dig> most abundant mirnas were also identified as highly abundant in bovine plasma in another study whereas 20 % were very abundant in human plasma  <cit> . common mirnas identified across studies include mir- <dig>  mir-92a, mir- <dig> and mir-423-5p.

one sample from day  <dig> of pregnancy was removed prior to differential expression analysis because it distinctly had very low total reads per million mapped . different comparisons of mirna expression data between non-pregnant  and pregnant groups  were made involving 1) the average expression over days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the oestrous cycle  for the non-pregnant group vs each of day  <dig> and day  <dig> of pregnancy  and 2) a direct comparison between day  <dig> of the oestrus cycle  and day  <dig> of pregnancy. principal component analysis based on these comparisons revealed no clear separation according to pregnancy status . changes in the levels of  <dig> individual mirnas which passed our quality filters  were determined for each comparison . differences in the expression of a limited number of individual mirnas were detected although they were generally small  and not significant after fdr adjustment . for one of the mirnas, mir-133a, levels were up to  <dig> -fold lower in day  <dig> pregnant relative to non-pregnant heifers  although the mirna was not detectable by qpcr and thus those differences could not be validated further.fig.  <dig> results of differential expression analysis of mirna sequencing data. a pca plot using data from all pregnant  and non-pregnant  time-points obtained by illumina small-rna sequencing. scatterplots for p <dig> vs np <dig>  p <dig> vs np  and p <dig> vs np  comparisons using individual mirna data are shown. the grey dotted lines indicate the 2-fold change threshold, and mirnas which changed more than 2-fold between groups have been labelled. all data have been log <dig> transformed

bovine plasma mirna profiling using qiagen pcr arrays
to complement our sequencing analyses we used a commercial custom pcr array platform to profile the expression of  <dig> unique bovine mirnas in the same plasma samples. as it is not feasible to screen a large number of samples using pcr arrays, we analysed  <dig> sample pools  from each of days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from non-pregnant heifers and from day  <dig> pregnant heifers .

we detected a total of  <dig> mirnas in bovine plasma , the most abundant of which  corresponded to mirnas reportedly expressed at high levels in blood cells including erythrocytes , leukocytes  and thrombocytes , and which are putatively released into the plasma through apoptosis, lysis or active secretion . the absence of detectable haemolysis in our samples  indicates the detected blood cell mirnas are predominantly the result of secretion/activation and not cell lysis.fig.  <dig> mirna abundance in bovine plasma pools determined by qiagen pcr arrays. a distribution of mean cq values for  <dig> conserved mirnas. b expression level of the  <dig> most abundant mirnas in bovine plasma )



comparing the  <dig> most abundant mirnas in each of the pcr array and sequencing datasets, only  <dig> mirnas  were common. a very abundant mirna in the sequencing dataset  could not be compared as it was not included in the pcr array. the overall poor agreement in abundant mirnas identified by the two techniques can in part be explained by platform-specific biases such as those associated with sequencing adaptor ligation and differences in primer-specific pcr efficiency, which are known to affect the representation of mirnas in a library therefore changing the perceived order of abundance of the mirnas within a sample .

as before, differential expression analyses for each mirna was performed considering the average expression value over days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the oestrous cycle for the non-pregnant group . principal component analysis of pcr array results showed a clear separation between np and p <dig> groups . of the  <dig> unique mirnas included in the analysis , a total of  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed between the two groups ,  <dig> of which at ≥ 2-fold .fig.  <dig> differential expression analysis using pcr array data. a pca plot and b scatterplot of individual mirna data . the grey dotted lines in b) indicate the 2-fold change threshold, and the highlighted data-points  represent fdr <  <dig> . the data have been log <dig> transformed. c volcano plot for the same data shown in . the horizontal dotted orange line indicates the significance threshold  and the vertical grey lines indicate the 2-fold change threshold. data-points representing differences with fdr <  <dig>  have been highlighted in red. the data have been log <dig> transformed

generally, we observed poor overlap between differentially expressed gene lists from the two high-throughput datasets. thus, only four of all mirnas differentially expressed  between pregnant  and non-pregnant animals in the pcr array, i.e. mir-99b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  were also different  between pregnant and non-pregnant groups  in the sequencing dataset. in some cases, the poor overlap was due to the mirnas being under-represented in the sequencing libraries  resulting in low-confidence profiles. other mirnas such as mir- <dig> were not included in the pcr arrays, therefore cross-platform validation was not possible. platform-specific biases  and the fact that pooled rather than individual samples were used in the pcr arrays may have also contributed to the relative lack of agreement between sequencing and pcr arrays. taken together, our results highlight the limitations of current circulating mirna profiling technologies, especially when subtle differences in gene expression are investigated, such as here, and show the importance of cross-platform validation.

rt-qpcr validation of high-throughput data
from the results of pcr array and small-rna sequencing we selected  a total of  <dig> differences in mirna abundance  for validation by rt-qpcr . since we did not want our selection of mirna candidates to be constrained by the limited number of differences originally obtained after fdr adjustment , in the validation analyses we included  <dig> differences which were significant  only before fdr adjustment. because day  <dig> of pregnancy was not included in the pcr array analyses , for the sake of inclusiveness both p <dig> and p <dig> were included in all validation analyses.

we could robustly quantify  <dig> individual mirnas by rt-qpcr representing a total of  <dig> differences in mirna abundance between pregnant and non-pregnant groups. for  <dig> of these differences  the results of qpcr were consistent with those obtained by pcr array or sequencing although significance was only obtained for mir-26a; an increase in the levels of this mirna was significant on day  <dig>  but not on day  <dig> . a trend for an increase in mir- <dig> levels on day  <dig> of pregnancy was also identified but was not statistically significant . to more robustly validate the changes in mir-26a during early pregnancy, particularly as they were relatively small, we analysed plasma samples from a different, larger group of heifers during early pregnancy . in this group of animals, when compared to levels before insemination, plasma levels of mir-26a were higher on day  <dig> of pregnancy . on average, mir-26a levels were also higher on day  <dig>  although this difference did not reach significance . thus, from analyses in two independent groups of animals we concluded that the levels of mir-26a increase during early pregnancy in heifers.fig.  <dig> results of rt-qpcr validation of high-throughput analyses data. a comparative fold-changes  in mirna abundance between pregnant and non-pregnant groups obtained by high-throughput analyses  and rt-qpcr. results to the left and right of the dotted line correspond to np <dig> vs p <dig> and np vs p <dig> comparisons, respectively . b rt-qpcr data plots  for selected comparisons between pregnant and non-pregnant groups including the two differences in mirna abundance that were significant  or tended to be significant . c rt-qpcr data plots  obtained from an independent group of heifers and which confirms an increase in plasma mir-26a levels during early pregnancy. np corresponds to plasma samples collected before insemination  from the same animals



although expressed ubiquitously, distinctly high levels of mir-26a have been reported in the embryo, the ovary, and immune-related tissues and cells such as the thymus and b/t cells of different species . interestingly, mir-26a has been shown to directly down-regulate ifn-β, a major cytokine involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, suggesting a potential role for this mirna as an immuno-suppressor during early pregnancy  <cit> . additionally, recent studies in pig and goat have reported increasing levels of mir-26a in the conceptus and the ovary as early as day  <dig> of pregnancy  <cit> . also, high plasma mir-26a levels have been associated with pre-eclampsia in humans  <cit> . these findings support the notion that mir-26a is involved in pregnancy, possibly by exerting immunomodulatory effects. further studies should investigate the precise origin and function of this mirna during pregnancy.

mir- <dig>  identified by pcr array analyses as differentially expressed in pregnant animals, was severely under-represented in our sequencing library, with only  <dig>  counts per million on average, which prevented any conclusions about its expression in bovine plasma. this may be the result of sequence- and secondary structure-dependent ligation biases during library preparation, a common issue with next-generation sequencing technology which affects all samples equally and thus is not considered to bias differential expression analyses . the case of mir- <dig> is a good example of the need to use different quantification methods for cross-platform validation of results. the levels of mir- <dig> in granulosa cells have been shown to vary during follicle development in bovine  <cit> , and mir- <dig> expression has been confirmed in bovine mammary glands, however little is known about its expression and functions in other tissues  <cit> .

the fact that results of rt-qpcr and high-throughput analyses agreed  for only  <dig> of the  <dig> differences in mirna abundance analysed may have been due in part to the intrinsically very low levels of rna contained in plasma; this, together with the presence of several inhibitors of rt-qpcr enzymes in plasma make accurate quantification particularly challenging, especially when differences between the experimental groups being compared are small. added to these are platform-specific biases and intrinsic inter-animal variation. in the case of the pcr arrays, the use of pooled samples may also have contributed to disagreement in the results from different profiling platforms. a recent study reported a  <dig>  % agreement in human liver and brain tissue mirna profiles across rt-qpcr, microarrays and small-rna sequencing platforms  <cit> , which is comparable to the agreement reported in our study. this most likely reflects the limitations associated with quantification of plasma mirnas discussed above. finally, we only attempted to validate a fraction of the differences identified in the pcr array and sequencing experiments; further validation analyses may identify additional potential mirna biomarkers of early pregnancy.

CONCLUSIONS
through rna sequencing and qpcr profiling in cattle, we identified for the first time changes in the levels of mirnas in plasma during early pregnancy. specifically, we identified an increase  in the levels of mir-26a during days  <dig> to  <dig> of pregnancy. these changes putatively reflect changes in mirna expression in one or more body tissues and may play potentially important roles in the establishment of pregnancy. overall, the differences in plasma mirnas levels between pregnant and non-pregnant animals were small; larger differences in circulating mirnas may occur at later stages of pregnancy. in addition, a limited ability to accurately quantify low abundance rnas using available technologies may have prevented detecting larger differences in mirna levels during early pregnancy. in summary, our results identify mir-26a as a novel candidate biomarker of early pregnancy in cattle.
