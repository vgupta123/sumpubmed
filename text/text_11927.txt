BACKGROUND
failure of spermatogenesis is one of the major causes of male sterility. many cases of human infertility are associated with low sperm production , poor sperm motility  and abnormal sperm morphology   <cit> . also, it has been shown that abnormalities of sperm chromatin, which is important for properly transmitting genetic information to offspring, can often be observed in cases of infertility  <cit> . although spermatid cells undergo a complex metamorphosis in a species-specific manner, resulting in various types of sperm morphology and other traits depending on species, fundamental processes such as the reorganization of the nucleus, cell organelles, and cell shape are found in most organisms  <cit> . thus studying genes involved in such processes can provide important information for a better understanding of spermatogenesis, which may also be applied to many other organisms.

macrostomum lignano  is a simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm, namely with male and female gonads within one individual, and a suitable model organism for gametogenesis research. an est database is available as a source for gene information http://flatworm.uibk.ac.at/macest/ <cit> . in addition, basic experimental techniques for gene analysis such as in situ hybridization and gene specific rna interference  are already established  <cit> . monoclonal antibodies against various types of cells are also available for detailed analysis of tissues  <cit> . the biggest advantage of m. lignano for spermatogenesis research is its transparency, which allows non-invasive observation of cells and tissues in live animals using light microscopy and thus allows very efficient screening of rnai phenotypes. finally, their frequent copulation and short generation time make it easy to examine mating behavior and the degree of reproductive contribution to the next generation  <cit> . also a lot of research has been done in terms of evolutionary biology, such as sex allocation adjustment, sexual conflict, and sperm competition  <cit> . thus studying m. lignano allows the comprehensive understanding of spermatogenesis, not only at the developmental level but also its significance in evolutionary aspects.

in m. lignano, the testes mainly consist of male germ cells such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and sperm. a thin layer of tunica cells encloses the testes. after meiosis, spermatids remain in four-cell clusters with cytoplasmic connections until just before the completion of sperm maturation  <cit> . mature sperm have a complex morphology, with distinct parts easily observed in the microscope. from anterior to posterior, sperm have a feeler, a body which ends in a pair of bristles, and a shaft which ends in a brush  <cit> . within the shaft the nucleus is condensed into connected packages of compact chromatin. the overall appearance of the sperm nucleus can be compared to connected railway carriages  <cit> . this morphology will be referred to as "train-shape" in this manuscript. sperm differentiation starts with the development of the anterior part which is followed by the elongation of spermatids and then the nucleus becomes enclosed in the shaft of the mature sperm. here we reserve the term 'sperm' for cells that have completed spermatogenesis and call the aberrant cells of the rnai phenotype 'aberrant spermatids'.

in the process of spermiogenesis, post-transcriptional control of mrna is very important  <cit> . in an elongating spermatid, the nucleus has to be condensed into a compact shape, which causes cessation of transcription. therefore, transcription of genes that are necessary for later stages has to be completed before chromatin condensation, but their translation needs to be controlled until they are needed. for this post-transcriptional control, such as transport, translational repression and storage of mrnas, the involvement of various types of rna binding proteins has been reported  <cit> . for example, during spermiogenesis dna-binding histones are gradually replaced by transition proteins  and then protamines , and it is suggested that protamine- <dig> mrna binding protein  has a role for proper translational activation of prm- <dig> mrna  <cit> .

elav genes are rna binding proteins that are characterized by three rna recognition motifs  and a hinge region between the second and the third rrm  <cit> . rrms are the most common protein domains found in all kingdoms and each rrm consists of 80- <dig> amino acids containing two conserved sequences called rnp- <dig> and rnp- <dig>  <cit> . structurally, a rrm has two α helices and four anti-parallel β strands, forming two β-α-β structures. it is suggested that proteins containing one or several rrms are capable of interacting with rna molecules  <cit> . molecular functions of the elav gene family are quite diverse, including mrna stability, splicing, translatability and transport  <cit> .

in this paper, we study a macrostomum elav-like gene, melav <dig> , using differential interference contrast microscopy, in situ hybridization, monoclonal antibodies, histology, and electron microscopy. we found that melav <dig> is expressed exclusively in the testes. moreover, we show that melav <dig> rna interference causes aberrant spermatid morphology, abnormal chromatin condensation, and an empty seminal vesicle leading to male-sterility. we thus prove that melav <dig> plays a crucial role for proper sperm differentiation and male fertility in m. lignano.

RESULTS
melav <dig> is an elav-like gene encoding three rna recognition motifs
melav <dig> was identified and isolated during the process of screening for gonad-specific genes in m. lignano. we found this gene in our est database with the keyword 'sex-lethal '. sxl is a well-known gene involved in sex determination in drosophila melanogaster, although its function is not conserved among all insects  <cit> . however, we found that, as described in detail below, melav <dig> had a higher similarity with elav genes than with sxl. we therefore named it melav <dig>  to distinguish it from melav <dig>  another elav-like gene present in our est database. given the scope of our paper we focused on melav <dig>  the entire open reading frame of this gene was obtained from the est clone angu <dig>  this gene was predicted to encode  <dig> amino acids.

using blastx analysis, we found that melav <dig> has a high similarity with the elav/hu gene family, which is characterized by three rrms with a hinge region between the second and the third rrm. multiple alignments with other elav-like genes  revealed that the first and second rrm of melav <dig> are relatively conserved whereas the third rrm does not show such a high homology.

the structure of the rrm is important for the interaction with rna. we therefore examined the structural similarity of melav <dig> and other elav genes. an rrm contains two α helices and four anti-parallel β strands, forming two β-α-β structures  <cit> . structural analysis using the swiss-model program revealed that melav <dig> has two such β-α-β structures in each rrm region and that they correspond to the β-α-β region of other elav genes . in the third rrm of melav <dig>  however, the β-α-β pattern was less distinct. we further analyzed melav <dig> using the smart program for identification and annotation of protein domains . according to this program, melav <dig> was considered to have three rrms, corroborating the similar overall gene structure to other elav genes. the e-value of the first and second rrm was  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively, and the e-value of the third rrm was  <dig> e- <dig>  all these e-values were for the rrm in the smart database .

blastx analysis also showed a certain similarity between melav <dig> and another elav related gene, sxl . structurally, sxl has two rrms. the third rrm of melav <dig> was not well conserved compared to other elav-like genes, but despite the similarity with sxl, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that melav <dig> seemed to belong to the elav-like gene family .

melav <dig> is expressed exclusively in the testes
in order to investigate the expression pattern of the melav <dig> mrna, we performed whole mount in situ hybridizations . 1-day old hatchlings possess a gonad anlage of 4- <dig> primordial germ cells  <cit> . however, expression of melav <dig> was not yet detected at this stage . melav <dig> expression was also lacking in 4-days old worms , which already have spermatogonia and spermatocytes but not yet spermatids. in subadult worms, which start to have maturing sperm, several cells in the testis were melav <dig> positive . in fully mature worms, which have an increasing number of maturating sperm and also developing eggs, melav <dig> expression became strong in the testes . cells on the edge of testis had no or only weak melav <dig> expression, while the signal around the center of the testis was stronger , suggesting that the expression level increased as spermatogenesis progressed. semi-thin sectioning after whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that spermatogonia and probably spermatocytes i did not express melav <dig> . furthermore, it seems that a weak signal was present in spermatocytes ii and a strong signal was observed in spermatids . mature sperm did not seem to express melav <dig>  considering that no expression was detected in fully mature sperm within the seminal vesicle . these results suggest that melav <dig> starts to be expressed at the late stage of spermatogenesis, but not anymore after spermatogenesis was completed.

melav <dig> rnai causes an aberrant spermatid morphology
by performing rnai gene knock-down experiments, we found that melav <dig> is essential for spermatogenesis in m. lignano. apart from the differentiating spermatids, we did not find remarkable morphological defects in other tissues such as spermatogonia and spermatocytes , neuropile and nerve cords , epidermis, muscles and gland cells , and various stages of oocyte development  of melav <dig> rnai treated worms. these observations are consistent with the testis-specific melav <dig> gene expression pattern . the animals had ovaries and developing eggs , and the other reproductive organs such as the female genital opening, the antrum , and the male copulatory stylet  exhibited a normal phenotype. however, melav <dig> rnai treated worms did not have any received sperm in their female antrum  and had no sperm in the seminal vesicle . in controls, on the contrary, both organs were full of sperm . in a few exceptional cases , we observed one or two aberrant spermatids in the seminal vesicle in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms , suggesting that the formation of the vas deferens was not affected by rnai. we therefore conclude that the empty seminal vesicle resulted, not from a lack of a vas deferens, but from a failure of sperm maturation, as described later. elav genes are known to function in the nervous system in other organisms, but the neuropile structure and the nerve cords of melav <dig> rnai treated worms appeared unaffected . furthermore, behaviors, such as swimming or feeding, also appeared to be normal in melav <dig> rnai treated worms.

the testes of melav <dig> rnai treated worms showed severe defects . the testis of control worms contained many maturating sperm, which were elongated and well organized in the central region of the testis . in live control animals the sperm were moving vigorously inside the testis. in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms, however, the content of the testis looked strongly disorganized , and internal movements occurred rarely. furthermore, testis components of control animals contained normal differentiating sperm , while in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms an accumulation of aberrant cells was present . note that not many mature sperm can be seen in control worms because they are transferred to the seminal vesicle as they complete spermatogenesis.

we next analyzed the morphology of single cells in detail . in control worms, spermatid cells were often seen as clusters of four cells until they finished spermiogenesis . spermiogenesis begins with the development of the feeler, then the body  and the bristles, followed by the formation of the shaft . after the the split of the tetrad the brush is formed . in melav <dig> rnai treated worms, however, most of cells were not in four-cell clusters, even before elongation was completed . in addition, many spermatids showed an aberrant morphology . in some cases, for example, round immature cells had feelers with the wavy morphology characteristic of developed sperm , while the feeler of normal spermatids in controls remained straight at that stage of development . in other cases, spermatids of melav <dig> rnai treated animals had a feeler and a pair of bristles but failed to elongate the shaft . this aberrant morphology was never observed in controls. taking all these features together, the morphological defects induced by melav <dig> rnai occurred mainly in the posterior parts, which are formed in the later stages of spermiogenesis.

melav <dig> is necessary for spermiogenesis
in order to determine exactly which stage of spermatogenesis was disturbed by melav <dig> rnai, we compared semi-thin sections of control and melav <dig> rnai treated worms. we found that spermatogenesis started to fail at the spermatid stage in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms . in the testes of control worms , spermatogonia and spermatocytes were observed at the peripheral regions, whereas elongating spermatids and sperm were located at the center. in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms , spermatogonia and spermatocytes seemed likely to be normal . however, from the spermatid stage onwards, cells started to become aberrant. the center of the testis was full of these aberrant cells with large vacuoles .

transmission electron microscopy revealed a failure of nucleus reorganization between the middle and the late stages of spermatid development . first, spermatogonia and spermatocytes i and ii looked normal in both control and melav <dig> rnai treated worms . in control worms , chromatin started to condense gradually during spermatid elongation and became reorganized into the train-shaped morphology in later stages . in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms, the early stage of spermatid development appeared to be normal, except for a precocious condensation of the chromatin . around the middle stages of spermatid development, we often observed already tightly condensed patches of chromatin , which was never found in the control worms. in addition, these cells often had large vacuoles in the cytoplasm . in some cases, cell components such as mitochondria and other organelles were observed outside of cell , suggesting that cells were dying by necrosis. cells with train-shaped nuclei were never observed in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms.

melav <dig> rnai interrupts the transition from spermatid to sperm
immunocytochemical staining with the monoclonal msp- <dig> antibody, which recognizes only early spermatids in m. lignano  <cit> , revealed that many cells did not complete the transition from early spermatid stage properly in melav <dig> rnai treated worms . in control worms the signal was always detected in clusters of four cells and the number of msp-1-positive cells did not exceed a few dozens . in the melav <dig> rnai treated worms, however, a considerably larger amount of msp-1-positive cells was observed , suggesting an accumulation of these cells in the testis. in some cases, the signal looked normal and cells were present in a cluster of four cells, but most of the msp- <dig> signal looked disorganized . these results suggest that the spermatid differentiation until early spermatid stage was normal but the transition to a later spermatid stage was not completed properly. therefore many later spermatids remained to hold a certain level of msp- <dig> protein in an aberrant appearance, probably because they were partially arrested, differentiating and/or dying.

discussion
melav <dig> encodes for an elav-like gene
our results clearly show a new biological function of an elav-like gene, namely the involvement of melav <dig> in spermatid differentiation in m. lignano. elav family genes have been mainly described to be involved in neural processes, such as the transition between proliferation and differentiation, maturation, maintenance of neurons, and learning  <cit>  . as previously outlined, the focus of the current study was on the testis-specific expression of melav <dig>  and we therefore did not explore the function of melav <dig>  we speculate that it may have a role in nervous system similar to other organism's elav-like genes .

elav genes are characterized by three rrms with a hinge region between the second and the third rrm. rrm is a quite common protein domain in eukaryotes  <cit> . for example, a recent analysis of ests in the planarian schmidtea mediterranea revealed that rrm was the second most common domain  <cit> . it is considered that slight changes in rrm can lead to different interactions with other proteins, leading to various types of functions  <cit> . in fact, recent findings revealed diverse molecular functions for members of the elav gene family. for example, elav has been shown to regulate alternative splicing of neuroglian, erect wing and armadillo transcripts in drosophila  <cit> . the human elav gene hel-n <dig>  has been suggested to stabilize glut <dig> mrna and to increase its translational efficiency  <cit> . in melav <dig>  the similarity of the third rrm was not well conserved compared to the first and the second rrm. recently, it has been indicated that the elav protein can form multimeric complexes  <cit> , and in vitro experiments suggested that the third rrm has a role for the multimerization, although this is not its only function  <cit> . it might be possible that the difference in the third rrm of melav <dig> contributes to a new interaction with the target mrnas involved in spermatogenesis.

melav <dig> is necessary for spermatid differentiation
the melav <dig> rnai phenotype showed severe defects in spermatids and an abnormally condensed chromatin. we do not consider these features as signs of an apoptotic process, but instead we found several indications for necrosis. first, cell components such as mitochondria were observed outside of cells , suggesting that cells were dying in a necrotic way. second, we observed neither nuclear fragmentation nor an apoptotic body, which are typical characteristics of apoptosis also in m. lignano  <cit> . third, cells often showed cytoplasmic vacuolization , which is unusual for apoptosis. fourth, we observed an accumulation of cells that failed to proceed properly into the later spermatid stages , suggesting that the elimination of such failed cells by programmed cell death did not occur.

we propose two possible explanations for the abnormal chromatin condensation and the failure of spermatid elongation. one possibility is that melav <dig> regulates the genes that mediate chromatin condensation, and chromatin condensation occurred too early as a result of melav <dig> rnai, leading to cessation of further sperm maturation, possibly due to an early stop in the transcription of essential genes. a similar phenotype was shown in spermiogenesis of transgenic mice where pre-mature translation of prm- <dig> occurred  <cit> . prm- <dig> should be repressed until a later spermatid stage for a proper transition from nucleohistones to nucleo-protamines. premature translation of prm- <dig> caused early chromatin condensation in round spermatids, a subsequent arrest in spermiogenesis and an aberrant spermatid morphology. these features correspond well with the melav <dig> rnai phenotype shown here  and therefore it appears possible that melav <dig> has a function in regulating prm- <dig> or other comparable genes.

another possible explanation is that cells retained their round shape because of the disruption of spermatid elongation. it has been reported that a human neuronal elav protein, hel-n <dig>  gene, upregulates the translation of neurofilament m  mrna by using human embryonic teratocarcinoma cells  transfected with hel-n <dig>  <cit> . overexpressed hel-n <dig> did not affect the level of nf-m mrna expression but instead recruited it into heavy polysomes more efficiently, resulting in the formation of neurites. if a similar molecular function is performed by melav <dig>  it is possible that melav <dig> is involved in promoting translation of some cytoskeletal elements such as sperm-specific intermediate filaments. the shortage of these elements caused by melav <dig> rnai could result in cessation of elongation, as is often seen in the posterior part at later spermatid stage  and the failed chromatin reorganization, in which the chromatin was condensed but never built in a train shape .

although melav <dig> has three rrms, we have no direct evidence whether melav <dig> really functions as rna-binding protein and, if so, what kinds of mrna are targeted. thus, identifying the target genes of melav <dig> and their interaction might be important follow-up experiments. recently, a transcriptome and a genome sequencing project have been initiated in m. lignano. therefore it will soon be possible to identify melav <dig> downstream genes by microarrays or in silico comparison of transcriptomes of control animals with melav <dig> rnai treated worms.

melav <dig> rnai treated worms are male-sterile
the seminal vesicles of melav <dig> rnai treated worms were empty, and in consequence they cannot transfer sperm to a mating partner, suggesting they are male-sterile. however, m. lignano is hermaphroditic and the female reproductive function of melav <dig> rnai treated worms was normal . so a melav <dig> rnai treated animal  would still be able to contribute offspring to next generation as a female after copulation with normal worms. thus, future experiments aimed at following their reproductive success of such 'females' and determining if such functional females could spread within a hermaphroditic population, would provide a better understanding of the evolution of different reproductive modes. in addition, the formation of the stylet and the male accessory glands in melav <dig> rnai treated worms was normal , which offers interesting possibilities for studies on sexual conflicts. recent experiments have suggested that male accessory glands and their secretions have important roles for increasing male reproductive success by manipulating the female reproductive physiology and behavior, such as increasing egg production, decreasing female's motivation toward further copulations with other partners, and decreasing female's longevity  <cit> . although we still need to analyze if melav <dig> rnai treated worms can in fact transfer ejaculates without sperm, such worms have a great potential to study the effects of seminal fluids in hermaphroditic organisms, by removing the effect of the transferred sperm itself.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that melav <dig> has a similarity with the elav gene family at the protein sequence level. elav genes are mainly known to be involved in the nervous system in other organisms, but our study clearly shows that melav <dig> plays a crucial role during spermatid differentiation in m. lignano. melav <dig> rnai disturbed the proper regulation of chromatin condensation and/or the cell elongation, resulting in aberrant spermatid morphology and male sterility.
