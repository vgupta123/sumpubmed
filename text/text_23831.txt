BACKGROUND
parkinson's disease  is a common neurological disorder characterized by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . the neuronal loss leads to deficiency of da in the striatum, which is responsible for characteristic motor symptoms such as akinesia, rigidity and tremor  <cit> . the medication using l-dopa and surgical treatment such as deep brain stimulation are established as effective therapies, although those treatments might not repair the dopaminergic pathway or prevent its degeneration  <cit> .

cell therapy was developed as a hopeful therapeutic tool for pd. neural stem cells  <cit> , neural precursor cells  <cit> , fetal cells  <cit>  and embryonic stem cells  <cit>  have been studied for treatment on pd model of rats. however, there are ethical problems about the usage of embryonic and fetal tissues. these cells are limited in availability and relatively difficult to be prepared. adult mesenchymal stem cells  have many advantages for cell therapy because of the easy availability and pluripotency without ethical problems  <cit> .

several cytokines are known to secrete from mscs. sdf-1α is one of the chemotactic cytokines  and the unique ligand for a cxc chemokine receptor   <cit> . the chemokines induced by inflammation in the central nervous system  usually play a role in the local immune response. meanwhile, recent studies showed that the central functions of chemokines are not restricted to neuroinflammation, as originally thought, but extend to novel functions  <cit> . sdf-1α was found to exert neuroprotective effects  <cit> . it suppressed cell loss of primary cortical cultures induced by h2o <dig> neurotoxicity with the modulation of neurotrophic factor-expression. rats receiving intracerebral administration of sdf-1α reduced infarct volumes with functional amelioration through up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins  <cit> .

recent studies reported that intrastriatal transplantation of mscs restored the function of nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems, leading to the early improvement of behavioral deterioration in pd model of rats  <cit> . however, there is no study that demonstrated therapeutic effects of intravenous msc administration for pd model of rats. furthermore, the mechanisms of functional recovery achieved by mscs transplantation have not been revealed completely so far. in this study, we explored whether intravenous administration of mscs exerted therapeutic effects on pd model of rats in vivo. then, neuroprotective effects of sdf-1α secreted from transplanted mscs were explored using 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells in vitro.

RESULTS
in vivo study
behavioral tests
in cylinder test , msc group significantly ameliorated forelimb akinesia over time, compared to pbs and fibroblast group .

in amphetamine-induced rotation test , msc group significantly reduced the number of rotations over time, compared to pbs and fibroblast group . thus, in the behavioral tests, msc group ameliorated behaviorally, compared to fibroblast and pbs group with significant differences.

th immunohistochemical staining in the striatum and snc
th staining revealed the significant preservation of th-positive fibers in the striatum  and th-positive cells in the snc  of msc group, compared to those of fibroblast group  and pbs group .

detection of transplanted mscs
at  <dig> days,  <dig> week and  <dig> weeks after cell transplantation, lungs, kidneys and brains were removed. we found that the majority of cells were localized to the pulmonary tissue and a few cells actually reached the brain and remained there at  <dig> days after transplantation . some cells were also observed in the pulmonary tissue and the brain at  <dig> week after transplantation , there were significantly fewer than those seen at  <dig> days after transplantation. there were no detectable gfp-positive cells in the brain at  <dig> weeks after transplantation.

in vitro study
characterization of mscs
we characterized mscs by immunocytochemical investigations. mscs were positive for matrix receptors, cd <dig>  and negative for leukocyte common antigen, cd <dig> .

secretion of sdf-1α from mscs
we used elisa to determine whether sdf-1α was secreted from the mscs. over  <dig> and  <dig> hours period in culture, mscs secreted  <dig>  ±  <dig> pg/ <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ <dig> hours and  <dig>  ±  <dig> pg/ <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ <dig> hours of sdf-1α.

cxcr <dig> staining
cxcr <dig> staining revealed that normal pc <dig> cells expressed cxcr <dig> . the expression of cxcr <dig> was also observed in 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after 6-ohda exposure. at  <dig> hours after 6-ohda exposure, the expression of cxcr <dig> was remarkably up-regulated on 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells compared with pbs-exposed pc <dig> cells .

tunel staining
nuclear fragmentation was observed in 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells at  <dig> hours after 6-ohda exposure. the cell viability of pc <dig> cells was significantly increased by sdf-1α treatment . treatment with pbs showed many tunel-positive apoptotic cells . treatment with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml of sdf-1α significantly reduced apoptotic cell death  compared to treatment with pbs. there were no significant differences among the different concentrations of sdf-1α, that is,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml.

hplc analysis
the supernatant containing da from 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells were analyzed with hplc. da release from 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells significantly increased by treatment with  <dig>   <dig> ng/ml of sdf-1α  compared to treatment with pbs . there were no significant differences between the concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml of sdf-1α.

neutralization assay for anti-apoptotic effect of sdf-1α
6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells treated with sdf-1α or msc supernatant showed significant suppression of apoptosis  compared with pc <dig> cells treated with sdf-1α combined with anti-sdf-1α antibody, only anti-sdf-1α antibody, msc supernatant combined with anti-sdf-1α antibody and pbs . these results suggested that msc supernatant exerted anti-apoptotic effects on 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells and sdf-1α antibody blocked the anti-apoptotic effect of sdf-1α.

discussion
we carried out intravenous administration of mscs on pd model of rats and evaluated its therapeutic effects focusing on sdf-1α. rats with msc transplantation significantly ameliorated both in cylinder test and amphetamine-induced rotation test, compared with fibroblasts and pbs group. correspondingly, rats with mscs showed better preservation in the density of th-positive fibers in the striatum and the number of th-positive neurons in the snc. to explore the underlying mechanisms, focusing on sdf-1α, we then proceeded to in vitro studies. in the in vitro studies, sdf-1α treatment suppressed apoptotic cell death of 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells with consequent increase of da release from the cells, compared with the control. furthermore, anti-sdf-1α antibody reduced the anti-apoptotic effects of sdf-1α.

anti-apoptotic effects of sdf-1α
in our present study, we demonstrated sdf-1α had anti-apoptotic effects against 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells in vitro. pc <dig> cells expressed cxcr <dig>  an exclusive receptor of sdf-1α. cxcr <dig> is a member of g protein-coupled receptor  family. many studies have shown that sdf-1α/cxcr <dig> interaction causes activation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /akt signaling pathway which provides enhanced survival signal and extracellular signal-regulated kinase  signaling pathway which provides enhanced cell proliferation  <cit> . a recent report also demonstrated that sdf-1α treatment reduced apoptotic cell death of endothelial progenitor cells under serum deprivation through pi3k/akt pathway and decreased caspase-3-activity, an important apoptotic molecule  <cit> .

in the cns diseases, intracerebral administration of sdf-1α  exerted neuroprotection on stroke model of rats with reduced infarct volumes and improvement in neural plasticity. the report showed that sdf-1α disrupted the downstream of caspase- <dig> apoptotic signal in the ischemic penumbra of stroke model of rats with subsequent cortical neuronal protection  <cit> . in pd model of rats, caspase- <dig> activity is deeply involved in the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons induced by 6-ohda  <cit> . therefore sdf-1α might enhance the survival of dopaminergic neurons through cxcr <dig>  inducing down-regulation of caspase- <dig> and activation of pi3/akt pathway.

the activation of da release by sdf-1α treatment
we showed that sdf-1α promoted da release from 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells. a recent report demonstrated that cxcr <dig> was constitutively expressed on dopaminergic neurons in the snc of normal rats and that sdf-1α could increase secretion of da from dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . thus, the results suggest that sdf-1α might activate nigrostriatal da transmission. in our study, da release might be increased by the functional preservation of 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells, as well as the enhanced survival of pc <dig> cells by sdf-1α, although the increasing effects on da release might not depend on the dose of sdf-1α. meanwhile, high dose of sdf-1α might have proapoptotic effects on the cells. studies on neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that  <dig> nm of sdf-1α induced neuronal apoptosis after  <dig> hours-incubation by the activation of signaling pathways involving src phosphorylation  <cit> . the discrepancy might lie on the differences of the used dosage, cells and experiment design, although we should know the fact that sdf-1α has neuroprotective effects with possible neuronal toxicity at high dose.

neuroprotective/neurotrophic effects of mscs
recently the therapeutic potentials of msc transplantation have been studied in various pathological conditions of the cns  <cit> . it have been demonstrated that intravenous administration of mscs increased the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor , suppressed apoptotic cell death, promoted endogenous cell proliferation and subsequently achieved functional recovery after stroke  <cit> . additionally, mscs produce neurotrophic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor , glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  and brain-derived neurotrophic factor , which are also well known as strong neuroprotectants  <cit> . the mechanisms of therapeutic effects of mscs in the ischemic brain might include neuroprotective effects through the secreted neurotrophic factors, effective angiogenesis for amelioration in the microenvironment of ischemic penumbra and enhanced neurogenesis with possible neuronal differentiation of transplanted mscs for synapse formation, although the number might be very low, especially with intravenous administration  <cit> . msc transplantation might also exert neuroprotective effects on pd model of rats at least partly through the secreted trophic factors  <cit> .

in our study, fluorescence microscopy revealed no detectable gfp-positive cells in the brain at  <dig> weeks after transplantation. this fact might be supposed from previous studies demonstrating that there were scant cells in the brain after intravenous transplantation of mscs  <cit> , although in our study, transplanted mscs might die during the disease progression or lose green fluorescence before euthanasia. nevertheless, msc transplantation exerted strong therapeutic effects, which might be the proof that secreted trophic factors from msc grafts might play a key role in the neuroprotective effects in our study. additionally, mscs were transplanted intravenously at  <dig> hours after 6-ohda injection. the early transplantation of mscs might be the reason of the strong therapeutic effects with the possibility to counteract 6-ohda toxicity. as shown in the in vitro study, sdf-1α from mscs probably contributed to the functional recovery as well as other trophic factors.

CONCLUSIONS
the present data provided evidences that mscs might exert neuroprotection for 6-ohda-exposed dopaminergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo through possibly with anti-apoptotic mechanisms. the results suggest the potentials of intravenous msc administration for pd. sdf-1α might be at least partly involved in the neuroprotective effects. clinical application of msc transplantation for pd patients might be considered, although further explorations are required.
