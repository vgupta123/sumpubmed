BACKGROUND
the innate immune system provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. amongst various effectors, antimicrobial peptides  which are found in all eukaryotes  <cit> , are potent agents against a wide range of pathogens, including gram-positive bacteria  and gram-negative bacteria , fungi and protozoa  <cit> . amps range from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues in length and are usually positively charged. based on their structures, cationic amps are divided into four major classes: α-helical peptides, β-sheet peptides which are stabilized by up to three disulfide bridges, loop structures containing only one disulfide bridge, and extended structures with a predominance of one or more amino acids  <cit> . while β-sheet peptides are structured in solution even before interaction, peptides from the α-helical class exist as disordered structures in aqueous media. some of these peptides, for example cecropins  <cit> , magainins  <cit> , and melittins  <cit> , become amphipathic helices upon interaction with the hydrophobic membranes of bacteria.

a major component of the outer membrane of gnb is lipopolysaccharide . when released, lps stimulates a strong inflammatory response in the host, which can lead to septic shock  <cit> . the sushi  <dig>  peptide derived from factor c of the horseshoe crab is extensively characterized  <cit> . it is an α-helical cationic amp, which binds lps with high affinity. the 34-amino acid s <dig> contains a motif with alternating hydrophobic and basic residues that are thought to be important for the interaction with lps  <cit> .

the mechanisms underlying the potent and rapid bactericidal activities of amps have been widely investigated  <cit> . according to the hypothesis of self-promoted uptake, the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged lps and the cationic peptide is important for the interaction of the peptides with the bacterial surface  <cit> . cationic peptides have a higher affinity than do native divalent cations for membrane-embedded lps and thereby destabilize the targeted areas, facilitating the translocation of the peptide through the outer membrane  <cit> . once the peptide has crossed the outer membrane and the mesh-like peptidoglycan cell wall, it is envisaged to interact with the negatively charged surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. to explain the mechanism of antibacterial action of membrane-active amps, several models have been proposed  <cit> . according to these models, the mechanism of action is thought to be the breakdown of membrane integrity by inducing pores or by a detergent-like membrane disruption leading to leakage of the cytosolic content.

although the lipid-binding and antimicrobial effects of amps have been intensively studied, the mechanisms by which amps kill bacteria remain controversial. moreover, the dynamics of bactericidal processes are relatively unknown. to date, most of the experiments and simulations that have aimed to elucidate the bactericidal mechanisms have been carried out with artificial membranes but not with live bacteria. the drawback of this approach was demonstrated recently by observations that leakage experiments with artificial membranes are not a reliable indicator for the prediction of antimicrobial activity in vivo  <cit> . in addition, most experiments to date have been carried out on ensembles, which may mask heterogeneous behavioral characteristics of the individual amp molecules.

here we report for the first time the use of a combination of high-resolution imaging, in vivo single molecule observation, and biochemical and biological functional assays to investigate the mechanism of action of a fully functional nanoparticle-labeled antimicrobial peptide. after treatment of bacteria with nanogold-labeled s <dig> and fixation, we made endpoint observations of bacterial killing using transmission electron microscopy . real-time measurements of the dynamics of quantum dot-labeled s <dig> on live bacteria were performed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy  and single particle tracking . to exclude the potential unreliability of the antimicrobial lysis assays, we developed a live bacterial lysis assay using escherichia coli that expresses a fluorescent protein. the combination of a high resolution single molecule imaging technique and in vivo bacterial lysis assays have allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of action of s <dig> with direct physiological relevance.

RESULTS
nanoparticle-labeled s <dig> retained its specific activity
to study s <dig> at a single-molecule level, we designed nanoparticle conjugates making use of the strong biotin-streptavidin interaction. we performed a variety of tests to be certain that conjugation of qdot to s <dig> does not affect the peptide activity .

firstly, the qdot label did not interfere with s <dig> interaction with membrane phospholipids. the tryptophan residue in s <dig> exhibits a characteristic blue shift in emission when entering a non-polar environment. unlabeled s <dig> showed a  <dig> nm shift in anionic phospholipids, such as pops or popg  <cit> . similarly, the tryptophan residue in s1-qdot showed the same spectral shift upon interaction with lipids such as pops , suggesting that s1-qdot has retained its ability to insert into the non-polar environment of the lipid. the control negs <dig> showed no spectral shift in any of the lipids tested  in additional file 1) demonstrating the specificity of the interaction between s <dig> and the bacterial membrane lipids.

secondly, qdot-conjugated s <dig> neutralizes lps as efficiently as unlabeled s <dig>  thus showing identical biological activity. when activated by lps, recombinant factor c  cleaves a fluorogenic substrate. neutralization of lps by s <dig> prevents rfc from cleaving the substrate. at a concentration of less than  <dig> nm, s1-qdot inhibited rfc to the same extent as s <dig> , suggesting that qdot labeling of s <dig> did not affect its binding and neutralization of lps. the control, negs <dig>  did not neutralize lps ).

thirdly, surface plasmon resonance experiments confirmed binding of s1-qdot to lipid a, the bioactive part of lps. the affinity of s <dig> and s1-qdot towards lipid a was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m, respectively. the binding is specific because biotin-qdot conjugates did not bind to lipid a.

finally, s1-qdot specifically and strongly interacted with gnb. following incubation of bacteria with s1-qdot, the samples were extensively washed prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis . bacteria were all positively stained with s1-qdot. interestingly, the fluorescence emission of s1-qdot bound to the bacteria was blue-shifted by  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm , similar to an observation reported for aptamer-conjugated qdot  <cit> . in addition, when e. coli were incubated with s1-qdot, they became highly fluorescent . with negs1-qdot, almost no signal could be obtained under the same conditions, similar to cells incubated with biotin-qdot. taken together, these results demonstrate that despite its size and chemical properties, the nanoparticle does not significantly affect the biochemical properties and functional behavior of the conjugated s <dig> 

s1-nanogold penetrates outer and inner membrane and enters the bacterial cytosol
the spatial distribution of the amps in and on the bacteria was determined by tem using nanogold-conjugated s <dig> as a reporter of s <dig> localization. after removing unbound particles by washing, the reaction was stopped using reagents which cross-link peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids. the nanoparticles were found on the inner and outer leaflets of the inner and outer membranes, as well as in the periplasmic space and cytosol of the bacterium . controls with nanogold alone confirm that this result is due to peptide functionality. we included negs1-nanogold as well as biotin-nanogold as controls. in these controls, particles could not be observed, neither free nor bound to bacteria. a further control included the use of both components separately , not as a peptide-nanogold conjugate. again, in all controls, particles could not be observed . therefore it can be concluded that only particles conjugated with s <dig> penetrate the membranes and enter the cell, demonstrating the specificity of the s1-nanogold.

to quantify particle distributions, we counted particles on or in the cells in tem images . when  <dig> μm s <dig> was used, approximately 77% of the particles were found attached to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane; less than 9% with the inner leaflet of the inner membrane; less than 7% in the cytosol; and 8% in the periplasmic space . these results suggest that s <dig> binds and penetrates the outer and inner membranes to disrupt the lipid bilayers of both membranes, allowing particles up to  <dig> nm to diffuse through the membrane barrier.

s <dig> induces immediate leakage of bacterial cytosolic content without release of lipopolysaccharide molecules
to determine the kinetics of bacterial killing by s <dig> in real time, we used fcs to measure leakage of green fluorescent protein  from gfp-expressing e. coli. fcs is based on fluorescence intensity fluctuations within a confocal volume. from these autocorrelation functions  can be determined which can be fitted with theoretical pre-determined models to extract molecular parameters for different fluorescence species  <cit> . in particular, by using fcs it is possible to determine the average time a particular fluorescent species takes to traverse the confocal volume and the number of particles within this confocal volume. the diffusion time  is directly related to the diffusion coefficient  since in fcs the following equation holds for diffusive processes: d·td = constant

the number of particles in the confocal volume of each species is proportional to their concentration and thus changes in their relative amounts in mixtures can be determined   <cit> . for our purposes, we analyzed the fluctuation correlation of gfp in order to determine amp-induced leakage from the cytosol of e. coli. before addition of s <dig>  gfp was trapped in intact bacteria and followed the diffusion times of the bacteria at approximately  <dig>  to  <dig> second. upon lysis, cytosolic gfp was released, showing diffusion times of only approximately  <dig>  ms, that is,  <dig> to  <dig> faster than that of intact bacteria. using fcs, we analyzed samples after addition of  <dig> nm amps or controls, at 5-minute intervals over a 1-hour period .

at  <dig> nm s <dig>  bacterial lysis started immediately after peptide addition. acf curves fitted with a two-particle diffusion model showed that about 40% of gfp measured was free gfp. bacterial lysis continued to progress as the fraction of free gfp increased steadily until a maximum of 90% was reached at about  <dig> min ). addition of  <dig> nm polymixin b  caused bacterial lysis in a similar manner to s <dig> but with a slower temporal response. the control negs <dig> showed minor lysis activity of less than 10% on average. the hydrophobic part of negs <dig> is identical to s <dig>  which could explain the minor release of gfp. in the absence of any peptide, there was no release of gfp until sds, a membrane-disrupting detergent, was added . these results suggest that s <dig>  at a concentration of  <dig> nm, was highly active against e. coli and causes rapid lysis of the bacteria. they also suggest that s <dig> as well as pmb can cause membrane defects of at least  <dig> Å in diameter in order for gfp to leak from the bacteria  <cit> .

to determine if s <dig> can disrupt the outer membrane and release lps molecules from the lipid bilayer simultaneously, we labeled e. coli with a fluorescent dye on the sugar residues of lps. after incubation with s <dig>  the cells were pelleted and the supernatant was analyzed by fcs. significant increase in fluorescence intensity was detected only when pmb, but not s <dig>  was used . thus, bacterial lysis by s <dig> does not result in a release of lps, in contrast to the action of pmb, as previously reported  <cit> .

s <dig> shows concentration-dependent dynamics in movement and lateral, decelerated diffusion on bacterial membranes during lysis
we employed fcs to determine diffusion coefficients of s1-qdot on membranes of live bacteria throughout the entire lysis process. s1-qdot was incubated with immobilized bacteria on a glass slide. within  <dig> to  <dig> min following the addition of  <dig> nm s1-qdot and  <dig> nm unlabeled s <dig>  the particles diffused laterally on the membrane at d =  <dig>  μm2/s, and then gradually slowed down around 11-fold to  <dig>  μm2/s after  <dig> min. at the end of  <dig> h, the addition of sds lysed the bacteria, releasing the amp-qdot into the supernatant . these particles have d =  <dig>  μm2/s which is comparable to that of free qdot diffusion in solution, and approximately  <dig> times faster than that of bound particles .

to confirm this observation, we characterized the peptide movement using spt. to track single particles on bacteria we used fm  concentrations of the s1-qdot. on e. coli, the movement of s1-qdot conjugates was fast at low concentration of 10- <dig> m for a qdot:peptide ratio of 1: <dig>  figure 4a shows that the average d of a single s1-qdot particle on e. coli was  <dig>  μm2/s. to observe the behavior of the peptides at functionally active concentrations, we added  <dig> μm unlabeled s <dig>  the movement was slowed down drastically as indicated by an approximately  <dig> times decrease in diffusion coefficient  after  <dig> min, and to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> μm2/s after  <dig> min . these results show that the dynamics of the particle change to a decelerated diffusion. in contrast, when  <dig> nm unlabeled pmb was added to fm concentrations of qdot-pmb, the conjugated particles on e. coli had an average d value of  <dig>  μm2/s. at a concentration of  <dig> nm s <dig>  s1-qdot showed an average d of approximately  <dig>  μm2/s, an order of magnitude slower than the movement of pmb .

in order to characterize the peptide movement relative to the bacterial cell, we analyzed trajectories of the particles on e. coli. we observed that the amp-qdot conjugates moved without any restriction along the bacterium . at low peptide concentration the movement was characterized by fast lateral movements , whereas the lateral movement slowed down at high peptide concentrations , indicating aggregation of the peptide.

discussion
after bacterial invasion, innate immune response is triggered and effector molecules such as amps are released and bind to their targets. upon interaction with the membrane lipids of the pathogen, s <dig> changes from an unstructured conformation to an α-helix. the importance of charge-charge interaction is demonstrated by results obtained with the control peptide negs <dig> in which cationic charges have been replaced by anionic ones. the peptide shows greatly reduced binding due to electrostatic repulsion which prevents the insertion of the hydrophobic part into the lipophilic moiety of the membrane. a possible explanation is that the initial interaction via charges is much faster than the slower insertion into the membrane by hydrophobic interaction. for further experiments we used qdot-s <dig> conjugates, which might give rise to concerns due to the large size of the probe relative to the peptide. however, we performed thorough testing to confirm functionality and demonstrated negligible influence of the nanoparticle in our experimental setups. using spt we were able to show in real-time that s <dig> binds to the bacterial surface and at low  concentrations, travels rapidly over the membrane. as the concentration of the peptide increases, its movement decreases by a factor of  <dig>  this indicates a multimeric association of s <dig> and the formation of membrane-active peptide complexes as well as the onset of lysis as shown by spt and live bacterial lysis assays. interestingly, s <dig> shows slower diffusion compared with pmb, which is known to act in a detergent-like manner  <cit> . this, together with the observation that s <dig>  in contrast to pmb, does not release lps from the bacteria, indicates that the peptides act mechanistically differently.

binding on and destruction of the outer membrane is insufficient for killing of the bacterium since the cell wall would resist osmotic burst. therefore an amp has to act on both the outer and inner membranes. using tem on e. coli, we show that binding of nanogold-s <dig> conjugates occurs on both leaflets of both membranes, where most of the particles are localized. only minor fractions of peptide conjugates could be found in the cytosol of the cell. a recently discussed hypothesis that amps might mainly be active against internal targets to kill the bacterium and not the membrane seems therefore implausible for s <dig>  <cit> .

as seen in tem preparations using  <dig> nm nanogold-peptide conjugate, s <dig> generates structural defects not less than  <dig> nm while penetrating both membranes through which the cytoplasmic components of e. coli leak out, leading to fast bacterial killing. however, there is no indication that s <dig> disrupts the membrane by acting similarly to a detergent or by forming well-defined pores. we can therefore conclude that the formation of defined pores like alamethicin is not the case for s <dig>  <cit> . whether the formation of these structural defects is a general feature of amps or an s1-specific mechanism remains so far unsolved, but challenges the proposed models, pore sizes, and number of peptides per complex.

in vivo, we envisage that the invading bacteria are not disrupted but simply inactivated by lysis without release of lps. the dead pathogens with s <dig> immobilized on their membranes are then cleared by macrophages. these observations bear a crucial advantage for the host system during infection since lps release could trigger a severe inflammatory reaction leading to septic shock  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to date, the exact mechanisms on how amps function on live bacteria have not been studied on a single-molecule level. the results presented here show how s <dig> interacts with the membranes in the steps leading to pore formation followed by bacterial death. for the first time, the entire process of bacterial killing by an amp has been systematically monitored using a comprehensive set of end-point and real-time observations. our results establish a temporally and spatially resolved view of the mechanism of s <dig>  elucidating the events taking place in a biological context seen from a single-molecule perspective. our findings suggest four successive steps of the bactericidal process of amps: binding, aggregation, membrane disruption, but not release of lps, and lysis of the bacterium.

we demonstrated that the antimicrobial peptide, s <dig>  binds to both the outer and inner membranes of gnb, leading to leakage of the cytosolic content. on the membrane, s <dig> shows concentration-dependent diffusive properties with reduced lateral mobility at high concentrations. during this multimeric association event, membrane defects of at least  <dig> nm are formed which are larger than the proposed pore sizes in the literature.

in addition to our results, the newly developed nanoparticle-conjugated amps represent useful tools for research in the field of antimicrobial or cell-penetrating peptides.
