BACKGROUND
chronic inflammatory periodontal disease is initiated by a bacterial biofilm called dental plaque that causes inflammation affecting the supporting structures of teeth, leading eventually to bone and tooth loss. porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobe of dental plaque and a putative pathogen in chronic periodontitis  <cit> . the plaque bacteria possess numerous virulence factors including factors that aid intracellular invasion, intracellular persistence and host cell apoptosis  <cit> .

apoptosis or programmed cell death is triggered by two distinct signaling pathways; the intrinsic or stress-activated and the extrinsic or receptor-activated apoptotic pathway  <cit> . both pathways activate their respective initiator caspases and converge to trigger executioner caspases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the caspase cascade cleaves key cellular components responsible for the hallmarks of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, pyknosis dna fragmentation, cytoskeleton collapse, blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies. apoptosis is prevalent in the gingiva at sites of chronic bacteria-induced inflammation  <cit> , particularly in the superficial cells of the junctional epithelium  <cit>  and the fibroblasts and leucocytes of the connective tissue  <cit> . in vitro studies show that p. gingivalis can modulate apoptosis in the following cell types: fibroblasts  <cit> , endothelial cells  <cit>  and lymphocytes  <cit>  and apoptosis has been proposed as a mechanism to explain the extensive tissue destruction in chronic periodontitis lesions.

it is not clear how p. gingivalis influences apoptosis in epithelial cells. in agreement with studies in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cardiac myoblasts and lymphocytes, several authors  <cit>  have shown induction of apoptosis in epithelial cells. in contrast, other laboratories  <cit>  have shown inhibition of apoptosis by p.gingivalis. the reason for the discrepancies between these studies remains unknown, although variable challenge conditions were used. in this regard, the dose of bacteria and the duration of p. gingivalis challenge may be a critical parameter in determining whether induction or inhibition of apoptosis will occur. thus, the aim of the current study was to characterize p. gingivalis-induced apoptosis of epithelial cells under various conditions, utilizing a wide array of apoptosis assays and gene expression profiling.

RESULTS
hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis show early signs of apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner
hgecs were challenged with live or heat-killed p. gingivalis  <dig> at an moi: <dig>  moi: <dig> and moi: <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> hours and m <dig> epitope detection was performed with immunohistochemistry. m <dig> is an antibody that recognizes a specific caspase cleavage site within cytokeratin  <dig> that is not detectable in native cytokeratin  <dig> of vital cells. this occurs early in the apoptosis cascade, before annexin-v reactivity or positive dna nick labeling. untreated cells were used as a negative control and cells treated with camptothecin  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> hours, an apoptosis-inducing agent, were the positive control. cells challenged with live or heat-killed bacteria at an moi: <dig> showed no positive staining at any time point . cells challenged with live or heat-killed bacteria at an moi: <dig> and moi: <dig> did not show any positive staining at  <dig> hours . the epithelial cells appeared morphologically normal under all of the above conditions. however, challenge with live p. gingivalis at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> hours increased the detachment of cells, while the remaining attached cells showed signs of blebbing, had pyknotic nuclei, and stained positive for m <dig> epitope, an early sign of apoptosis . in contrast, cells challenged with heat-killed p. gingivalis at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> hours did not show any signs of apoptosis . cells challenged with live p. gingivalis at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> hours completely detached from the plate, thus moi: <dig> was not used for subsequent experiments.

live but not heat-killed p. gingivalis induce caspase- <dig> activation in hgecs in a time-dependent manner
hgecs were challenged with live or heat-killed p. gingivalis  <dig> at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> hours and caspase- <dig> activity was measured fluorometrically. caspase- <dig> is an executioner caspase involved in both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. caspase- <dig> activation plays a key role in the initiation of cellular events during the early apoptotic process. untreated cells were used as a negative control and cells treated with camptothecin were the positive control. there was no significant increase in caspase- <dig> activity after  <dig> hours challenge with live or heat-killed bacteria . however, after  <dig> hours challenge with live p. gingivalis, caspase- <dig> activity increased more than 2-fold compared to the negative control. in contrast,  <dig> hours challenge with heat-killed p. gingivalis resulted in a caspase- <dig> activity level similar to the negative untreated control. these results are in accordance with our previous results, confirming that challenge with live, but not heat-killed, p. gingivalis at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> hours can induce apoptosis in human gingival epithelial cells.

hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis undergo dna fragmentation in a time- and dose-dependent manner
hgecs were challenged with live or heat-killed p. gingivalis  <dig> at an moi: <dig> and moi: <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours and dna fragmentation was detected by elisa, as well as by tunel. untreated cells were used as a negative control and cells treated with camptothecin or dnase  <dig> u/ml were used as a positive control. once the caspase cascade has been activated, the inhibitor of caspase-activated dnase  is cleaved liberating this dnase and resulting in fragmentation of the chromosomal dna. the cell death detection elisa can detect internucleosomal degradation of genomic dna during apoptosis and provide relative quantification of histone-complexed dna fragments . there was no significant increase in dna fragmentation after  <dig> hours challenge with live or heat-killed bacteria . however,  <dig> hours challenge with live p. gingivalis, resulted in dna fragmentation 3-fold higher than the negative control. on the other hand,  <dig> hours challenge with heat-killed p. gingivalis resulted in negligible increase in dna fragmentation, suggesting that, although some apoptosis is evident after challenge with heat-killed bacteria, the effect is not statistically significant . at  <dig> hours, dna fragmentation was at similar levels as at  <dig> hours. these results were also confirmed by tunel. the tunel assay measures and quantifies apoptosis by labeling and detection of dna strand breaks in individual cells by fluorescence microscopy. the assay uses an optimized terminal transferase  to label free 3'oh ends in genomic dna. cells challenged with live or heat-killed bacteria at an moi: <dig> did not show any positive staining at any time point . cells challenged with live or heat-killed bacteria at an moi: <dig> did not show any positive staining at  <dig> hours . the epithelial cells appeared morphologically normal under all of the above conditions. however, the cells challenged with live p. gingivalis at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> hours showed signs of blebbing and pyknotic nuclei and stained positive for tunel , confirming our previous observations using m <dig> epitope detection . in contrast cells challenged with heat-killed p. gingivalis at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> hours did not show any signs of dna fragmentation .

p. gingivalis-induced apoptosis in hgecs is dependent on either arg- or lys- gingipains
p. gingivalis-induced apoptosis has been shown previously to depend on gingipain activity in fibroblasts and endothelial cells  <cit> . gingipains are cysteine proteases produced by p.gingivalis that cleave after an arginine  or a lysine  residue. to elucidate the role of gingipains in our p. gingivalis-induced apoptosis model, hgecs were challenged with whole live bacteria  as well as filtered bacterial supernatant  of the following strains: wild-type p. gingivalis 33277; wild-type w50; the arg-gingipain  double mutant e8; the lys-gingipain  mutant k1a; or the arg-lys-gingipain  triple mutant kdp <dig>  all strains were utilized live at an moi: <dig> and the filtered supernatants at a 10× dilution. dna fragmentation was assessed by tunel after  <dig> hours. hgecs were also challenged with live wild-type p. gingivalis  <dig> or its filtered supernatant previously incubated with leupeptin, a specific rgp inhibitor, zfkck, a specific kgp inhibitor, or a cocktail of both gingipain inhibitors. untreated cells were used as a negative control and cells treated with dnase  <dig> u/ml were used as a positive control. increased detachment of cells was observed upon challenge with  <dig> and w <dig> detached from the plate, while the remaining cells showed signs of blebbing and pyknotic nuclei and stained positive for tunel , confirming our previous observations on live wild-type p. gingivalis. when any of the gingipain deficient mutants was used for the live challenge, dna fragmentation was not evident , suggesting that the presence of either arg- and lys- gingipains is necessary for apoptosis and that depletion of any one of them completely abolishes p. gingivalis-induced apoptosis in hgecs . furthermore, cell detachment was still observed to a lesser extent with both e <dig> and k1a, suggesting that apoptosis is independent of cell detachment . the difference between the strains is unlikely to be due to differences in bacterial viability, since the viability over time in culture was similar for all strains examined . the role of gingipains in hgec apoptosis was also confirmed by using specific gingipain inhibitors . furthermore, apoptosis was still observed when hgecs were challenged with filtered supernatant of p. gingivalis  <dig> culture , but not when the challenge was performed with supernatant pre-incubated with gingipain inhibitors  or supernatant derived from the gingipain-deficient mutants . these results suggest that apoptosis is not dependent on bacterial invasion and although invasion might influence the apoptotic process our data reaffirm that gingipains are sufficient to invoke this process.

purified gingipains can induce detachment and apoptosis in hgecs
our previous experiments with live bacteria and bacterial culture supernatant suggest that either arg- or lys-gingipains are necessary for apoptosis in hgecs. in order to determine if specific purified gingipains are also sufficient to induce apoptosis, hgecs were challenged with purified hrgpa, rgpb and kgp for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours and dna fragmentation was assessed by tunel . all three gingipains were able to induce cell detachment and apoptosis, although at different time points. for hrgpa, signs of apoptosis were already evident at  <dig> hours post-challenge, while for rgpb and kgp, tunel positive cells appeared at  <dig> and  <dig> hours respectively. for all three gingipains, the percentage of apoptotic and detached hgecs increased progressively over time. by  <dig> hours, hgecs challenged with hrgpa and kgp had completely detached from the plates, while some clumped cells still remained on the plates challenged with rgpb .

different wt p. gingivalis strains induce apoptosis with similar kinetics
hgecs were challenged with live p. gingivalis  <dig> or w <dig> at an moi: <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours and phosphatidylserine  externalization was measured by annexin-v staining. untreated cells were used as a negative control. a slow gradual increase in both annexin-v single and annexin-v/7-aad double positive cells was noted for hgecs challenged with both strains compared to the unchallenged control over  <dig> hours . the percentage of apoptotic cells was 4– <dig> fold higher than the unchallenged control  <dig> hours after challenge with either wt strain. the results of this kinetic study confirm our previous observations that apoptosis occurs late upon p. gingivalis challenge. furthermore, the similarity in the kinetics of the response between the two strains suggests that the observed apoptosis is a characteristic of p. gingivalis and not an attribute of a single strain.

p. gingivalis challenge of hgecs results in upregulation of genes related to apoptosis
hgecs were challenged with live or heat-killed p. gingivalis  <dig> at an moi: <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> hours and qpcr was performed on a focused panel of  <dig> apoptosis-related genes . live bacteria strongly upregulated apoptosis related pathways, as indicated by caspase cascade activation and apoptotic signaling activation in response to dna damage. more specifically, the pro-apoptotic molecules caspase- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  bid and bax were upregulated at  <dig> and strongly upregulated at  <dig> hours, while the anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> was also upregulated at  <dig> hours. both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways appear to be involved, as indicated by the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling, as well as the fas signaling pathway, tnfr and il-1r signaling pathways . the effect of heat-killed bacteria was less pronounced, indicating that higher doses or longer challenge times would be necessary to induce apoptosis.

discussion
we demonstrate that primary hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis for  <dig> hours exhibit apoptosis, evidenced by m <dig> epitope detection, caspase- <dig> activity, dna fragmentation and annexin-v staining. apoptosis was dose and time dependent and live bacteria strongly upregulated apoptotic intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, including the pro-apoptotic molecules caspase- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  bid and bax. arginine and lysine gingipains are clearly essential factors in apoptosis and depletion of either inhibits apoptosis.

in the present study, live p. gingivalis induced considerable apoptosis in human gingival epithelial cells between  <dig> and  <dig> hours at moi: <dig>  as evidenced by m <dig> epitope detection , increased caspase- <dig> activity , dna fragmentation  and annexin-v staining . these results agree with previous reports on fibroblasts  <cit> , endothelial cells  <cit>  and lymphocytes  <cit> . in contrast, heat-killed porphyromonas gingivalis did not induce apoptosis.

apoptosis is a complex process regulated by multiple pathways such that no single molecule gives sufficient information on the dynamics of apoptosis. after an apoptotic stimulus, a subset of pro-apoptotic molecules is upregulated and others such as bcl- <dig>  an anti-apoptotic molecule, downregulated, with cellular fate depending on the fine tuning of all pathways involved. we used a focused array of  <dig> apoptosis-related genes to elucidate the apoptotic process . live p. gingivalis strongly upregulated apoptosis pathways: evidenced by caspase cascade activation and apoptotic signaling in response to dna damage. both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways appear to be involved in this process: evidenced by activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling, as well as fas signaling, tnfr signaling and il-1r signaling pathway . in terms of individual molecules, the pro-apoptotic caspase- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  bid, bax, tnf, tradd, fadd, il-1b, il-1r <dig>  irak- <dig> were upregulated after  <dig> hours. on the other hand, the anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> was also upregulated, but this did not appear to be sufficient to ensure cell survival, as indicated by the apoptosis assays . the upregulation of bcl- <dig> is in agreement with nakhjiri et al  <cit> , underlining the fact that single molecule and single time point assessments alone can be misleading.

hgecs were challenged with live or heat-killed p. gingivalis  <dig> at moi: <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> hours. negative control was unchallenged hgecs in media. the data shown represent log-fold differences in gene expression  between the respective sample and the negative control. a value of  <dig> indicates no change, less than one indicates down-regulation and greater than one, up-regulation 

it has been suggested that apoptosis due to p. gingivalis challenge of human cells involves the gingipains  <cit> . gingipains are cysteine proteases produced by p. gingivalis that are either secreted or membrane bound and arginine or lysine specific. in the present study, the mechanism used by p. gingivalis to induce apoptosis in gingival epithelial cells was shown to be dependent upon both arg- and lys- gingipains . gingipain deficient p. gingivalis mutants did not cause apoptosis as evidenced by a lack of dna fragmentation indicating that gingipains are necessary for apoptosis to occur and that their depletion abolishes p. gingivalis' ability to induce apoptosis in hgecs. this suggests a step-wise enzymatic action of these gingipains on substrates such that action of one alone is not sufficient. similarly, inhibition of apoptosis was also observed when the wild-type p. gingivalis was pre-treated with specific gingipain inhibitors, providing evidence that the observed lack of apoptosis is due to the lack of gingipains and not other potential differences between the wild-type strains and the mutants.

furthermore, filtered cell-free supernatant derived from wild-type p. gingivalis culture, as well as purified gingipains, retained the ability to induce apoptosis in hgecs , providing evidence that the gingipains are sufficient for the induction of apoptosis and that the presence of whole cells is not necessary for this process. this suggests that apoptosis is not dependent on bacterial invasion and although invasion might influence the apoptotic process our data reaffirm that gingipains are sufficient to invoke this process. the ability of the bacterial culture supernatant to induce apoptosis was lost when it was pre-incubated with specific gingipain inhibitors, while bacterial culture supernatant derived from gingipain-deficient mutants did not result in apoptosis . these results are in agreement with previous studies in endothelial cells  <cit> . the mechanism of action of gingipains has been shown to be both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent  <cit>  and in vitro evidence suggests that gingipains may activate caspase- <dig> by cleaving procaspase- <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to variable bacterial strain virulence and variable host resistance, local factors, such as moi or length of exposure, could vary across different areas of the lesion and inter-laboratory differences in apoptosis studies may reflect these variables. thus, results from different laboratories and studies may supplement rather than conflict each other in elucidating the actions of p. gingivalis on host epithelial cells. in areas where the bacteria to epithelial cells ratio is low or the exposure time is short, bacterial invasion  <cit>  may result in cell survival  <cit> , contributing to the chronicity of the periodontal lesion. on the other hand, in areas with high bacteria to epithelial cell ratio or longer exposure time, the bacterial insult may result in apoptosis  <cit> , contributing to extensive tissue destruction. further translational studies are needed to determine which scenarios predominate in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides evidence that live, but not heat-killed, p. gingivalis can induce apoptosis after  <dig> hours of challenge in primary human gingival epithelial cells. either arginine or lysine gingipains are necessary and sufficient factors in p. gingivalis elicited apoptosis.
