BACKGROUND
the specialization of the vasculature is driven by a number of molecular pathways that dictate the fate of blood vessels to that of an artery or vein  <cit> . following this initial programming, the development of the lymphatic system is dependent on the further differentiation of the venous endothelium. the newly differentiated lymphatic endothelial cells migrate in a polarized fashion to coalesce into an early lymph sac, which then progress to form the lymphatic vasculature proper  <cit> .

a number of genes have been found to be associated with the lymphatic endothelial cell profile, for example lyve- <dig>  podoplanin and vegfr- <dig>  <cit> . in addition to this profile, the transcription factor prox <dig> has been found to act as an important regulatory switch, altering the molecular identity of venous endothelium and imparting them with attributes that augment lymphatic development. indeed, genetic ablation of prox <dig> results in embryonic lethality; hemizygous null mice are found to die shortly after birth  <cit> . in both cases, a major developmental defect was found to involve the emerging lymphatic system. specifically, the early lymphatic endothelial cells  that normally bud off from the cardinal vein  in a polarized manner do not do so. instead, prox <dig> null lecs do not migrate, resulting in defective lymph sac formation and consequently no development of a functional lymphatic system. furthermore, these null cells molecularly default to a more vascular-like phenotype. to this end, prox <dig> null mice display lymphedema and chylous ascites buildup resulting in death  <cit> .

it is clear that vascular endothelial cells require the regulated expression of prox <dig> early in development, initiating a transcriptional program that results in lymphatic differentiation. this point underscores the plasticity of differentiated endothelial cells under the influence of prox <dig>  indeed, microarray analysis of vascular endothelial cells engineered to overexpress prox <dig> resulted in the upregulation of lymphatic specific genes while downregulating a number of blood specific genes  <cit> ; this study extending the known surface markers of lymphatic endothelial cells by providing a more in-depth characterization of lec gene signature. the in vivo knockout data demonstrates that prox <dig> plays an important role in early lymphatic development. furthermore, targeted deletion of prox <dig> within vascular endothelial cells recapitulates the lymphatic defect and the edematous phenotype  <cit> . moreover, in vitro studies suggest that this lymphatic defect is potentially due to an inability to molecularly reprogram early vascular endothelial cells to a lymphatic fate  <cit> . given this however, it is not clear whether the reprogramming to a specific gene signature does indeed occur in vivo. here we describe an in vivo model to address the molecular significance of prox <dig> in reprogramming vascular endothelial cells to that of a lymphatic gene profile.

RESULTS
prox <dig> expression in double transgenic mice
in order to investigate whether prox <dig> is necessary and sufficient in regulating cell fate, we have generated a mouse model that forces the expression of prox <dig> specifically in vascular endothelial cells. our transgenic model takes advantage of a bigenic expression system driven by the tie <dig> promoter . this model results in targeted expression within vascular compartments such as the cardinal vein as well as the dorsal aorta . while the expression of prox <dig> in dt embryos is also found on both arteries and veins, both these vascular structures appear to differentially overexpress prox- <dig> throughout development in our model suggesting that arterial and venous endothelial cells may regulate prox- <dig> rna/protein levels in a different fashion. while the directionality of the budding lymphatic endothelial cells appear to be more tightly regulated in control embryos, dt embryos appear to display more prox <dig> positive cells in the periphery. these results suggest that normally, prox <dig> expression and lymphatic endothelial cell budding are tightly controlled and can be disrupted by the overexpression of prox <dig> in the developing vasculature.

phenotype of dt prox <dig> mice
as development progresses, both the vascular and lymphatic system matures to form two separate yet critically interrelated circuits. in early development, there are no overt deficiencies in the blood vasculature of dt embryos. however, by e <dig>  we begin to observe small hemorrhages on the surface of developing dt embryos . at later stages in development we notice some subtle delays in growth, more profound blood loss, with blood pooling within the embryo . in the most severe embryonic cases we find anemic embryos that display massive edema at e <dig>  where the epidermis separates from the body as a result of trapped extravasated fluid . upon further analysis, dt embryos that harbor the most severe phenotypes also display enlarged lymph sacs relative to their control counterparts . these results suggest that the overexpression of prox <dig> can pose a developmental crisis during early gestation. indeed, 33% of postnatal dt's do not make the expected mendelian double transgenic ratio . however, the majority of the postnatal dt's do appear to survive to birth. these results suggest that the overexpression of prox <dig> can have deleterious consequences in the developing embryo correlating with hemorrhaging, anemia and edema.

marker analysis of yolk sacs from prox <dig> dt mice
given the influence of prox <dig> on gene regulation in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, we further investigated the possibility of a switch in the molecular identity of endothelial cells using markers that are influenced by prox <dig>  to this end, we started our analysis with the yolk sac, a relatively simple tissue that is rich in blood vasculature . analysis of control or dt embryos reveal that the overexpression of prox <dig> in vascular endothelial cells could alter gene expression to that of a more lymphatic endothelial cell signature. for example, transcripts for genes such as vegfr- <dig> and cycline <dig> increase while vegfr- <dig>  neuropilin <dig> and stat <dig> decrease . furthermore, protein levels from yolk sacs derived from dt embryos demonstrate that vegfr- <dig> and tie <dig> decrease while neuropilin- <dig> increases with a marginal increase in vegfr- <dig>  wholemount analysis of dt yolk sacs support the reprogramming event, indicated with an increase in podoplanin expression that correlates with prox <dig> overexpression . consistent with previous findings, the overexpression of prox <dig> in vascular endothelial cells appear to sufficiently alter the gene signature of becs to that of a more lec profile in vivo.

jugular veins from prox <dig> dt embryos display lymphatic markers
to visualize the potential of prox <dig> in reprogramming the vascular endothelium, markers such as vegfr- <dig> and podoplanin were used to analyze the developing jugular vein . within the dt samples, it was found that the levels of vegfr- <dig> increased relative to that observed in the control embryos . previous studies by schacht et al. show that podoplanin expression is tightly regulated during development, being expressed early on the jv and gradually being downregulated by e <dig> . this downregulation coincides with a shift in expression to the developing lymph sacs derived from the same jv  <cit> . interestingly, at the timepoint where podoplanin expression should be downregulated on the jugular vein, dt embryos show strong expression of podoplanin relative to controls . these results further suggest that the overexpression of prox <dig> can alter the expression pattern of vascular endothelial cells to that of a more lymphatic signature.

overexpression of prox <dig> correlates with changes in junctional proteins in vivo and in vitro
with the overexpression of prox <dig>  changes in gene signatures are observed in the developing embryo. these changes correlate with defects in embryonic development such as edema and hemorrhaging. while it suggests that the overexpression of prox <dig> in the early developing vasculature is causal to these defects, the functional explanation for the edema and hemorrhaging is unclear. one possibility that may explain the observed developmental defects may lie in changes in vessel permeability upon prox <dig> overexpression. to investigate this possibility, proteins that are associated with tight junctions were analyzed from yolk sacs of control and dt embryos. interestingly, the overexpression of prox <dig> results in the alteration of junctional proteins from the normal pattern of expression such as zo- <dig>  occludin and to a lesser extent jam- <dig> . further analysis using cultured venous endothelial cells  <cit>  show that overexpression of prox <dig> results in a similar trend of misregulated junctional targets such as zo- <dig> and pecam- <dig> , these changes correlating with an altered cellular morphology . to further define the consequences of prox <dig> overexpression in vecs, an in vitro permeability assay via boyden chamber was performed comparing control vecs with those that overexpress prox <dig>  significantly, vecs that overexpress prox <dig> display a higher degree of permeability, assessed by the passage of fitc-albumin, when compared to control vecs . this suggests that vecs become more permeable with prox <dig> overexpression, potentially due to alterations in the integrity of cell-cell junctions.

discussion
the importance of prox <dig> in initializing differentiation was shown to be a result of its ability to reprogram blood endothelial cells to a lymphatic endothelial cell profile. this molecular switch shown in vitro suggested that prox <dig> initiates the transcriptional machinery necessary for lymphangiogenesis  <cit> . while the prox <dig> knockout study as well as a tissue specific deletion of prox <dig> in the endothelium  <cit>  point to the necessity of prox <dig> in lymphatic development, it does not provide a complete extension on the molecular players that confer the ability to reprogram the blood vasculature as suggested from in vitro studies  <cit> . to this end, one way to address this involves the specific overexpression of prox <dig> in the endothelial cell compartment. in the present study, we examine the importance of vascular reprogramming and fate specificity in vivo with a tie1/prox <dig> bigenic mouse model that specifically expresses prox <dig> in early vascular endothelial cells.

early expression of prox <dig> in vascular endothelial cells result in no overt embryonic phenotype, however as development progresses prox <dig> double transgenic embryos appear growth delayed and display more overt bleeding. of the most serious cases, dt embryos are anemic and edematous. this correlated with the alteration of a number of molecular targets associated with vascular reprogramming such as an increase in vegfr- <dig>  neuropilin- <dig> and stat <dig> and a decrease in neuropilin- <dig>  vegfr- <dig>  tie- <dig> and cycline <dig>  <cit> . examination of the most severely affected dt embryos show a general degradation of the embryonic structure, separation of the epidermis and enlarged lymph sacs when compared to their wild type counterparts. furthermore, vascular structures such as the jugular vein, which normally express low levels of vegfr- <dig> and podoplanin are now highly positive for these lymphatic markers. in conjunction with previous data demonstrating the importance of prox <dig> in bec differentiation to lecs, we present data that provides further in vivo evidence of the molecular players involved in the reprogramming of becs to lecs early in lymphatic vascular development. consistent with our data, it was recently observed that sox <dig> is upstream of prox1; in vitro overexpression of sox <dig> in embryonic stem cells and vascular endothelial cells results in the upregulation of prox <dig> and an increase in lymphatic markers such as podoplanin, indirectly confirming our data presented here  <cit> . in addition, the conditional deletion of prox <dig> results in the dedifferentiation of lymphatic endothelial cells to that of a more vascular endothelial cell-like phenotype  <cit> . this further suggests that prox <dig> is critical for the maintenance of the lymphatic endothelial cell fate, and that endothelial cells are genetically malleable. our in vivo study further confirms the importance of prox <dig> in generating a lymphatic profile by altering the gene signature of vascular endothelial cells.

one consequence that results from the overexpression of prox <dig> in the vascular compartment of the developing embryo is edema. at the histological level, we observe the separation of the dermal layer from the epidermis as a result of fluid leakage, characteristic of an improper lymphatic drainage system. furthermore, a prominent feature of the most severely affected embryos is the enlargement of the lymph sacs. it is unclear as to the mechanism of the increased size, whether it is from an increase in the number of differentiating early lymphatic endothelial cells budding from the jugular vein, or from an increase in proliferation of committed lymphatic endothelial cells that are in the process of or have already formed the lymph sac. interestingly, early analysis of e <dig>  dt embryos show an increase in prox <dig> positive cells in the periphery; this increase in population may play a contributing factor to the increase in lymph sac size. the potential for an increase in proliferation due to prox <dig> overexpression is consistent with previously published work that identifies the upregulation of a number of cell cycle targets such as cycline <dig> and p57kip  <cit> .

the data suggests that the overexpression of prox <dig> during early embryogenesis results in the reprogramming of vascular endothelial cells to a more lymphatic cell fate resulting in edema, hemorrhaging and death. while it demonstrates the importance of tightly regulating prox <dig> in development, it is unclear as to why the hemorrhaging occurs. in our model, one can hypothesize that the overexpression of prox <dig> may influence junctional proteins involved in maintaining the integrity of cell-cell contacts; alterations in these same complexes may result in changes in vascular permeability leading to a more permeable, lymphatic-like state  <cit> . indeed, upon prox <dig> overepression changes in junctional proteins are observed away from the normal molecular profile associated with control embryos. previous studies have shown that increases as well as decreases in junction protein levels have been shown to be associated with an increase in permeability  <cit> , suggesting that a balance is required in order to maintain the integrity of the cell-cell interface. recent data has found that the overexpression of prox <dig> in colon epithelial cells result in dysplasia and transformation that correlates with changes in cellular adhesion  <cit> . furthermore, conditional deletion of prox <dig> results in aberrant junctional complex formation and abnormal pericyte association  <cit> . these lines of evidence point to the importance of cell-cell integrity in the regulation of vascular permeability. moreover, the controlled expression of prox <dig> is critical for normal lymphatic development in the embryo.

it is clear that the measured expression of prox <dig> as well as other lymphangiogenic factors during embryonic development is essential for the proper formation of the lymphatic vasculature. not surprisingly, compromising this regulated expression has been found to result in negative clinical consequences. for example, the growth of lymphatic endothelium in tumors is a result of the presence of vegf-c, which acts on lymph vessels to enhance metastasis  <cit> . other events include the transformation and cellular reprogramming of spindle-like lesional cells by karposi sarcoma herpesvirus /human herpesvirus- <dig> . interestingly, gene profiling of khsv infected lesional cells produce a signature similar to that derived from a lymphatic endothelial cell; targets that include prox <dig>  lyve- <dig> and vegfr- <dig>  this suggests that karposi sarcoma genetically mimics an expression pattern similar to a differentiated lymphatic endothelial cell  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we extend the previous in vitro studies that characterized the molecular profile of reprogrammed vascular endothelial cells that overexpress the prox <dig> transcription factor. furthermore, we also demonstrate that the tight regulation of prox <dig> is critical for normal embryonic lymphatic development. while the expression pattern of prox <dig> in our model does not fully recapitulate the gfp expression found in the tie1-gfp mouse model, it is clear that when prox <dig> is overexpressed in our tissue specific model it results in aberrant lymph sac development, hemorrhaging, edema, anemia and ultimately, embryonic lethality. in a corresponding study, johnson et al. demonstrated that prox <dig> was essential for the maintenance of the lymphatic phenotype, where a global temporal deletion of prox <dig> during mid-development effectively deprograms lymphatic structures to that of a vascular endothelial-like phenotype, assessed by surface markers such as podoplanin and slc  <cit> . our data presented here complement the work by johnston et al., whereby the tissue specific overexpression of prox <dig> reprograms similar markers to a more lymphatic-like profile. furthermore, we elucidate some of the molecular components that accompany vascular endothelial cell reprogramming involved in early lymphatic differentiation and development. the development of our unique model complements and extends the current viewpoint of prox <dig> being an important initiator of lymphatic development via its ability to reprogram endothelial cells to a specific molecular profile.
