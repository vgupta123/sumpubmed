BACKGROUND
the large diversity of genes present in the pangenome of prokaryotic species  has been one of the most remarkable revelations of genomics. in addition to a ‘core genome’ that contains genes present in all strains, genomes can harbour a number of ‘flexible’ genes that are absent from one or more strains or that are unique to each strain  <cit> . it is now well established that the flexible genome is a major contributor to the genetic diversity of prokaryotic communities. it is often organized into large clusters of genes known as flexible genomic islands   <cit> . one way to explore the species pangenome is to conduct a comparative genomic study of multiple isolates. however, this type of study is very difficult to achieve with microbes that are not readily cultivated, such as haloquadratum walsbyi. this halophilic archaeon represents up to 80 % of cells in nacl-saturated brine of most saltern crystallizers  <cit>  and saturated brines worldwide  but is notoriously difficult to maintain under laboratory conditions. consequently, only two strains are available in pure culture strain hbsq <dig>  isolated from crystallizer cr <dig> in a santa pola saltern in spain  <cit>  and strain c <dig>  from geelong saltern in victoria, australia  <cit> .

the issues raised by cultivation can be circumvented through metagenomics. for example, fgi can be delineated through tiling of metagenomic reads from the microbe’s habitat to its reference genome. in such an experiment, known as genomic recruitment, the well-represented “core” genes will recruit a large number of metagenomic fragments at high sequence similarity while, at the same time revealing areas of underrepresented flexible genes. previously, some of us applied this approach to describe variability in natural population of h. walsbyi in the cr <dig> metagenome  <cit> . recruitment of h. walsbyi hbsq <dig> genome in this metagenome showed that the h. walsbyi population was composed of multiple clonal lineages that differ in four genomic regions. this variability was attributed to i) genes involved in formation of cellular wall including surface layer , ii) genes involved in uptake of nutrients  and iii) provirus integration   <cit> . variable islands were later revealed by comparison with the genome of the australian isolate c <dig>  <cit>  and similar situations were found for many bacteria , what makes this scenario scalable to prokaryotes at large. in free-living prokaryotes, the flexible genes are considered to contribute to organismal fitness. for example, the variability at the level of s-layer is considered a strategy to dilute predating pressure  <cit> .

alternative views were reported, most recently in a recruitment study on environmental genomes of h. walsbyi assembled from metagenomic dna of lake tyrell. this study reported gi <dig> but not the other genomic islands and observed large genomic rearrangements, insertions and deletions  <cit> .

given the current state-of-the art, it is difficult to attribute the majority of bacterial and archaeal losses to predating protist grazers. in crystallizers of studied spanish salterns the grazers appeared only occasionally and were not actively feeding on bacteria and archaea  <cit> . however, they have been reported from other hypersaline systems  and were found to actively feed on bacteria and archaea in the crystallizers of a korean saltern  <cit> . on the other hand, viral communities reach unusually high numbers  in crystallizers  <cit> . intriguingly, in the system studied here, viruses do not exert strong control over growth and abundance of bacteria and archaea and cause less than 5 % of cell lyses per day  <cit>  and in 40 years of studies on crystallizer cr <dig>  a massive lysis event collapsing the h. walsbyi population has never been observed. in crystallizers of salterns located in some parts of the world where the variation in environmental factors through time is negligible and h. walsbyi is the dominant species  this seems to be the pattern. but it is possible that hypersaline systems that are subjected to variation of environmental factors may behave differently. for example, australian lake tyrell experiences summer desiccation, accompanied by a change in solution chemistry and significant variation in temperature. not surprisingly, the structures of the archaeal, bacterial and viral populations were found to change on timescales of months to years  <cit>  and these changes correlated with changes in environmental factors. however, even in such dynamic systems the viral diversity remained constant  <cit> .

to extend our knowledge on population genomics in h. walsbyi, we decided to use metagenomics to recover flexible genomic islands directly from environmental dna by fosmid cloning. we have focused our study to the area of gi <dig>  which is enriched in cell-wall related genes that include the s-layer. this island stretches over  <dig>  kb in strain hbsq <dig> and  <dig>  kb in c <dig>  <cit> . burns et al.,  <cit>  reported that the cell wall was three-layered in strain hbsq <dig> and two-layered in strain c <dig>  this difference was hypothesized to be a consequence of the different gi <dig> content and remains to be established experimentally  <cit> . we retrieved and studied gi <dig> of seven previously unknown h. walsbyi lineages that were present in the cr <dig> crystallizer at a single sampling time. in addition to provide a detailed description of these novel regions, we discuss their contribution to our current understanding of population genomics of this archaeal species.

RESULTS
general features of the metagenomic fosmid inserts
three versions of h. walsbyi gi <dig> are presently available, two in the genomes of h. walsbyi c <dig> and hbsq <dig> and one present in fosmid clone ehwalsbyi <dig>  <cit> . the last two came from the same pond, crystallizer cr <dig>  which has been extensively studied for many years  <cit> . in order to recover other environmental versions of gi <dig>  we made use of the fosmid library flas cr30- <dig> that was constructed in  <dig>  using cr <dig> environmental dna  <cit> . within the fosmid-end sequences of this library, we found seven clones whose inserts overlapped gi <dig> in the genomes of hbsq <dig> and c <dig> . the clones were recovered and their inserts completely sequenced and assembled. in accordance with existing nomenclature  <cit> , the inserts were denominated ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> to ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> 

the fosmid inserts ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in length and from  <dig> to 53 % in gc content and encoded a total of  <dig> putative orfs . most of the obtained sequences had no identical counterparts in databases and despite intensive annotation efforts , 40 % of the orfs were hypothetical proteins. in a general classification in clusters of orthologous groups  , only 37 % of the orfs could be assigned and a significant portion  belonged to the class transposase and inactivated derivatives, highlighting the dynamic nature of ehwalsbyigi <dig>  also abundant were categories -inorganic ion transport and metabolism  and  cell wall/membrane biogenesis . orfs affiliated with these two groups corresponded exclusively to abc-type cobalt/fe3+ transport system  and s-layer domain proteins, both of which are typically found in gi <dig> of h. walsbyi and similar genomic islands of other species  <cit> . detailed information on the putative functions of the  <dig> orfs, their putative post-translational modifications and cellular localisation are shown in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> general features of fosmid inserts presented in this study

to confirm that these dna fragments belonged to uncultured h. walsbyi and not to other archaea also present in the brines, we calculated their tetranucleotide frequencies and performed a principle component analysis  <cit> . when dna fragment size is appropriate, the oligonucleotide frequencies carry a good phylogenetic signal useful to identify species or genera of environmental dna fragments  <cit> . therefore, we first compared tetranucleotide usage in ehwalsbyigi1s, genomes of h. walsbyi and genomes of other cr <dig> microbes with low gc-content . this analysis showed that all the ehwalsbyigi1s sequenced cluster together with the genomes of h. walsbyi. in a second analysis, we compared the ehwalsbyigi1s and h. walsbyi genomes split into non-overlapping fragments of an approximate size of gi <dig> . this analysis clustered ehwalsbyigi1s, isolate hbsq <dig> and c <dig> gi1s and the giant protein halomucin separately from the ‘core’ genomic regions of h. walsbyi genomes . this reflects the particular composition of these proteins which are often enriched in acidic aminoacid residues and contain few cysteine residues  <cit> , as observed in ehwalsbyigi1s . another hallmark of surface-expressed proteins is the abundance of amino acid repeats. the repeats are presumed to allow surface proteins flexibility in structure and to bind water, ions and other substrates  <cit> . in ehwalsbyigi1s, repeats  were found in  <dig> out of  <dig> orfs studied . among  <dig> unique repeats detected,  <dig> were enriched in proline and threonine . this type of repetition was found in genes encoding cell surface glycoproteins, s-layer proteins, and subtilisin-like serine proteases. in eleven proteins, this repeat was a simple direct pt-repeat , while more complex pt-repeats were most often unique to individual genes  . repeat ttatpeptatp was common to s-layer protein genes of ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>  ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> and ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>  the s-layer protein genes had another common repeat, the pentapeptide avgdl. the exact localization of the repeats in the ehwalsbyigi <dig> and ehwalsbyi <dig>  <cit>  genes is shown in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> principle component analysis of tetranucleotide frequencies usage in a) ehwalsbyigi1s , h. walsbyi hbsq <dig> , c <dig> , candidatus haloredivivus sp. g <dig> , candidatus nanosalina sp. j07ab <dig>  and candidatus nanosalinarum sp. j07ab <dig>  and b) ehwalsbyigi1s, and h.walsbyi hsbq <dig> genomic segments of 35 kb in size



gene order and regions of synteny between fosmid clones
the tblastx comparisons of the novel ehwalsbyigi1s, ehwalsbyi <dig> and their equivalent regions in h.walsbyi hbsq <dig> and c <dig> delineated two major clades . clade i was formed by eight sequences. these were all significantly different  and presented mosaic structure in which clusters of conserved genes alternated with highly variable ones. no gene duplications or inversions could be observed. the largest regions of synteny were observed between ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> and  <dig> and genomic sequences of h. walsbyi hbsq <dig>  ehwalsbyi <dig> and ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>  the most different fosmid insert analysed was ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>  the lack of synteny was consistent with a 16 kb region within the island deriving from an inserted provirus . in contrast, clade ii was composed of completely syntenic and almost identical  sequences . it is remarkable that, in spite of their high similarity, these sequences originate from geographically distant salterns  that were sampled at different time-points   <cit> .fig.  <dig> gi1s of h. walsbyi isolates hbsq <dig> and c <dig>  ehwalsbyi <dig> and ehwalsbyigi1s obtained in this study. the shadings link homologous regions between the gi1s and ehwalsbyigi1s and percent identity is shown in the scale located in the upper right corner. locations of g1s on h. walsbyi genomes are indicated by nucleotide position numbers at the beginning and at the end. arrows indicate the origin and end of the gi <dig>  orf names are as annotated in genbank, are colour coded and designated on the left



overview of genes encoding cell surface glycoproteins
the most remarkable feature of ehwalsbyigi1s was the presence of unique clusters of genes encoding cell surface proteins. only two of these genes were common to all ehwalsbyigi1s, likely because most fosmid sequences did not contain full-length versions of gi <dig>  the first is located to the 5' end of gi <dig> . it encodes a putative cell surface protein with an n-terminal signal peptide and presumed to be anchored in the cell membrane through a c-terminal transmembrane helix. its amino acid sequence is well conserved at both terminuses ; c–terminal, 75–100 % similarity ). the two conserved regions are separated by a proline-threonine repeat-motif that among the different homologs ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and contributes significantly to their variability. a similar phenomenon has been observed previously in cell surface proteins of certain pathogenic bacteria  <cit> .

the second common gene is less conserved in terms of amino acid sequence  and corresponds to the major cell surface glycoprotein . we know from previous studies that this gene is expressed in h. walsbyi hbsq <dig> and c <dig>  and that it encodes the s-layer protein that is exposed on the surface of h. walsbyi cells as monomolecular crystalline array  <cit> . all these homologous genes are uniform in size  and similar in terms of domain organisation and post-translational modifications. interpro searches predicted an n-terminal signal peptide, followed by major cell surface protein family signature , and a recognition sequence for an archaeosortase, an enzyme that in related species mediates proteolysis-coupled, covalent cell surface attachment  <cit> . besides, they contain regions that are putatively n-glycosylated and a threonine rich o-glycosylated carboxy region, as illustrated in fig. 3a. the remarkable diversity of these proteins is reflected in their phylogeny as they form three distinct groups .fig.  <dig>

among the highly variable genes, the most striking are the four homologs of halomucin  <dig> gene, hmu <dig> . previous studies suggested that hmu <dig> contributes to the formation of a capsule in strain hbsq <dig>  <cit> . interpro server predicted these homologs to encode large  multidomain extracellular proteins with domains involved in recognition/depolymerisation of polysaccharides: n-terminal pectin lyase fold/virulence factor, parallel beta helix repeat domains, and acidic peptide-dependent hydrolase/peptidase domain. besides, the homologs also contained n-terminal papd-like domains, which can contribute to assembly of surface organelles involved in cellular attachment  <cit> . whether these proteins can contribute to the formation of capsule or aid in aggregation of individual h. walsbyi cells into the postage stamp-like sheet, remains to be established experimentally.

a spectrum of carbohydrate-recognizing protein domains is the common attribute of the only group of genes that is conserved in terms of synteny. the domain structure and the amount of variability in these proteins is reminiscent of the one in surface antigens of pathogenic bacteria where it reflects strategies to avoid host immune response . these genes, annotated as major variable surface proteins  encode putative integral membrane proteins that vary in length  and in domain architecture. they present either a pectin lyase fold/carboxypeptidase/parallel beta-helix repeat or an invasin-intimin/cell adhesion domains/bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains. furthermore, the c-terminal region of hq <dig> and homologs in ehwalsbyi <dig>  ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> and  <dig> has a ca2+ binding domain.

orfs involved in metabolic activities
clade i sequences contain genes predicted to encode extracellular proteases that are anchored in the membrane by their c-terminal region . the predicted proteins possess an ef hand motif, a helix-loop-helix motif found in a large family of ca2+ binding proteins. besides, clade i gene clusters  contain an abc cobalt/iron  transporter gene. meanwhile, ehwalsbyi <dig>  ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> and  <dig> contain a 5' nucleotidase gene. inserts of ehwalsbyi <dig>  ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contain homologs  with cupredoxin domains typically found in archaeal type i copper peripheral membrane proteins. such proteins, termed halocyanins, serve as mobile electron carriers and are commonly found in halophilic archaea; in fact, the core genomes of h. walsbyi strains contain three halocyanins. however, the similarity of these core genomic halocyanins to those in ehwalsbyigi1s is restricted to domain organisation and gene size and their similarity to database sequences is ≤30 %.

mobile genetic elements
in contrast to gi <dig> of h. walsbyi hbsq <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , the ehwalsbyigi1s contain mobile genetic elements: ish9-type , is- <dig> , and is- <dig> and is <dig> transposases . their presence is associated with a decrease in synteny, which is most evident in the transposase-rich ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> and ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>  this indicates that mobile genetic elements contribute to the dynamic character of this region.

in ehwalsbyigi <dig> there is some evidence that h. walsbyi expands its pangenome through provirus integration. the sequence of ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> harbours proviral remnants downstream to the gene homolog of hbsq <dig> hq1196a . it contains two hypothetical proteins that are similar to hypothetical proteins in environmental halophages ehp- <dig>  and ehp- <dig> . further downstream, a putative primase is similar to halorubrum virus c6phi <dig> . the gc content of the region affiliated with the virus was  <dig>  % and similar to that of virus hrpv- <dig> , a representative of the haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses  <cit> .

recombination events contribute to the diversity of cell-wall associated genomic island 1
previous studies indicated that homologous recombination contributes to diversity of cell-wall associated genomic islands in aquatic prokaryotes, including h. walsbyi . this prompted us to analyse recombination events among the ehwalsbyigi <dig> and equivalent regions in the sequenced h. walsbyi genomes using splitstree  <cit> . this tool detected conflicting phylogenetic signals within the sequences which resulted in a reticulate phylogenetic tree . phi test for recombination confirmed that the conflicting signals were due to recombination .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic network of full length gi <dig> of h. walsbyi hbsq <dig> and ehwalsbyigi1s sequences created with splits tree using the uncorrected p characters transformation



the alignments were further analysed using rdp <dig> to identify the positions of recombination breakpoints. rdp <dig> detected  <dig> recombination events that were distributed along eight out of the ten genomic islands studied . in the case of ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> and  <dig>  the recombined segments stretched throughout most of the island length  and included the gene encoding the s-layer protein. in a similar fashion, a relatively small  recombination event affected the s-layer protein in fosmid ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>  in fosmid ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig>  a recombinational event affected the homologue of hq <dig>  all these recombinations were identified by more than two methods, were highly supported  and indicate that genetic exchange of cell-wall associated gene clusters in h. walsbyi could have an effect similar to that of capsular switching in pathogens. as one would expect, the recombination events were not limited to the region affiliated with gi <dig>  but extended upstream or downstream of this region as evident in ehwalsbyigi1_ <dig> 

the genes in the cell-wall associated genomic islands are maintained in the population and are under purifying selection
recently transferred genes are known to be under faster and relaxed evolution and are expected to have high rates of nonsynonymous substitutions to nonsynonymous site  compared to synonymous substitutions to synonymous site   <cit> . over time, the genes that contribute to organismal fitness will accumulate less amino acid changing mutations and this will be reflected in dn/ds ratio that is significantly lower than one. accordingly, the non-beneficial genes will display a dn/ds ratio near one  <cit> . however, such values need to be taken cautiously when analyzing closely related genomes  as they can arise because the time has been too short for selection to act  <cit>  or because nucleotide substitutions within a species may represent segregating polymorphisms and not fixed differences  <cit> .

the selection analysis was performed using jcoda  <cit>  and kaks calculation tool  . the results were comparable and showed that most homologous genes present in the cell-wall associated genomic islands have dn/ds ≤ <dig> . this indicates that the genes were not recently acquired, and that they are functional and maintained in the population by selection. in fact, only a few genes, such as hq <dig> and hq <dig>  displayed dn/ds ≥ <dig> and could be considered under positive selection. these results are in agreement with values obtained when selection analysis was applied to similar regions in marine and pathogenic microbes  <cit> .

discussion
the metagenomic approach used in this study allowed us to study unique genome stretches belonging to seven previously unknown lineages of h. walsbyi that simultaneously inhabit crystallizer cr <dig>  the analysis of their gene content confirmed the contribution of this region to the formation of a functional cell wall. however, the different versions of ehwalsbyigi <dig> recovered presented some additional interesting features. particularly notable was the abundance of proteins predicted to have carbohydrate-binding domains. further analyses of individual ehwalsbyigi <dig> genes identified putative proteins that could contribute to the protection of cell from desiccation .

individual ehwalsbyigi <dig> genes were under purifying selection, indicating that they are beneficial to the h. walsbyi population. we attributed their high level of variability  to multiple processes; such as frequent homologous recombination and the presence of transponible elements. furthermore, the abundance of repetitive gene regions indicated that h. walsbyi achieves additional variability of the cell surface proteins through modification of existing genes. for example, homologs of hq1193a differ mostly in the length of proline-threonine repeat motif. it is known that repetitive gene regions are prone to errors during replication which generate changes in the number of repeat units that are up to  <dig> times more frequent than point mutations  <cit> .

the variability of clonal lineages at the level of cellular envelope is a well-documented phenomenon and is considered to reflect the interplay between archaeal and bacterial cells and their viral predators . hypersaline waters  typically have high concentrations of bacterial and archaeal cells  and even higher levels of virus particles , while supporting few grazing ciliates and flagellates  <cit>  . we know from previous studies  <cit> , that the h. walsbyi population is infected by viruses of the order caudovirales, which use surface proteins, polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides as receptors in order to initiate the infection  <cit> , and it is not uncommon for bacterial populations to respond to phage predation by varying their cell surface proteins  <cit> . actually, the analysis of ehwalsbyigi <dig> genes yielded an impressive arsenal of putative virus defence mechanisms. for example, the presence of capsule-related hmu <dig> gene in several ehwalsbyigi1s indicates that the corresponding lineages could produce an additional envelope layer. this layer would mask the viral receptor forcing viruses to cleave the capsular polysaccharide in order to access the receptor. in line with these observations, the presence of putative glucanase genes in environmental genomes of halophilic viruses has been reported from this and other environments  <cit> . prokaryotic cells can also avoid viral adsorption by modifying the receptor proteins. a well-known example comes from prochlorococcus, in which point mutations on genes involved in the synthesis of the phage receptor  originated resistant strains  <cit> . a similar variation  can be seen in the gi <dig> gene that encodes the pseudoperiplasmic component of abc cobalamin/iron  transporter, which displays high level of sequence conservation . as membrane-bound lipoproteins, these archaeal abc transporter proteins are possibly targets of phage attachment.

another edge in viral avoidance can be gained by the presence of multiple proteins on the cellular surface  <cit> . we know from previous studies that h. walsbyi c <dig> has  <dig> genes annotated as cell surface proteins. however, only four gene products were detected on the cell surface. these correspond to the s-layer protein, a product of gi1’s hqrw_ <dig> and products of hqrw_ <dig>  hqrw_ <dig> and hqrw_ <dig> that are located elsewhere in the genome and are common to both isolates  <cit> . in contrast, the cells of h. walsbyi hbsq <dig> lack crispr but have the potential to build a more complex cellular surface as deduced from the complexity of gi <dig>  this increased complexity as well as the presence of highly variable genes  might be advantageous for viral defence. if a virus initially binds to the protein other than the primary receptor, that would trap it in the initial phase of infection. this way, if several glycoproteins are exposed on the cellular surface, they would act as decoys, increasing the chance that the cell will survive the encounter with viruses.

in methanosarcina mazei, it has been shown that the genes that lead to organismal growth in multicellular structures  are expressed only under certain environmental conditions  <cit> . while the expression of h. walsbyi gi <dig> genes remains to be established, the presence of putative transcription regulators in the vicinity of these genes indicates that they might be expressed in response to a stimuli or environmental change. such transient expression would in turn decrease the probability for virus to infect its host.

recent research indicated that in haloarchaea n-glycosylation of proteins plays a role in predator–prey interplay: viral dependence on n-glycosylation machinery of the host results in strain-specific glycosylation of its proteins as recently demonstrated in halorubrum sp. strain pv <dig> and haloarchaeal pleomorphic virus  <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, changes in composition of the glycan that is added to the viral structural proteins diminished its ability to infect the cell  <cit> . from the genomic sequence of h. walsbyi hbsq <dig> and c <dig> it is evident that the n-glycosylation of surface proteins, including the s-layer protein is probably strain-specific. both genomic sequences have unique agl gene clusters and besides, the genes involved in synthesis of sialic acid are absent from the c <dig> genome  <cit> . this difference could vary individual lineage’s susceptibility to viruses. along these lines, some archaea process surface proteins by distinct n-glycosylation pathways in responses to environmental changes, as recently showed in haloferax volcanii  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that fosmid library construction is a useful approach in population studies of species that are difficult to maintain under laboratory conditions. screening of h. walsbyi enriched fosmid library yielded seven previously unknown versions of ehwalsbyigi <dig>  we showed that the diversity of ehwalsbyigi <dig> arises through several mechanisms that include mobile genetic elements and homologous recombination. detailed analysis of these regions showed that the h. walsbyi population in cr <dig> is composed of two major clades that differ in complexity of cell surface structures. while ehwalsbyigi <dig> clade i, represented by a single cr <dig> clone and the genome of isolate c <dig>  contained completely syntenic sequences composed of only four genes, ehwalsbyigi <dig> clade ii was complex, mosaic in structure, and contained conserved and variable genes. the latter included the gene that encodes the s-layer protein, a gene similar to halomucin that may contribute to capsule formation/multicellular growth and highly variable surface proteins that were preserved only in terms of synteny. the domain structure and the variability of these proteins led us to believe that their diversity arises as a consequence of trying to avoid predation by viruses. sequence analysis indicated that h. walsbyi has several mechanisms that might provide viral defence including receptor masking, modifying the receptor proteins, and transient receptor expression.
