BACKGROUND
many different aspects of neuronal function, including neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles, are regulated by alterations in the concentration of intracellular free ca2+  <cit> . the transduction of calcium signals into appropriate physiological responses is frequently mediated by a range of calcium sensor proteins, which act as effectors and modulators in signalling pathways  <cit> . the specific effects of these changes depend on their affinity for ca2+, their cellular localization in relation to the ca2+ entry signal and their interaction with other proteins. a number of calcium binding proteins related to the ubiquitous protein calmodulin are overrepresented in or expressed only in the nervous system. these include the family of intracellular neuronal calcium sensor  proteins  <cit> . members of this protein family, which have been identified in many organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, bind ca2+ at their ef-hand domains and regulate many important processes in neuronal signalling. this family can be divided into five subfamilies or classes  based on their amino acid sequence similarity  <cit> .

drosophila frequenin , the homolog of the mammalian neuronal calcium sensor- <dig> , was the founder member of the ncs family and the first to be characterized being, at this time, the only component of the class a  <cit> . frequenin is a high affinity calcium-binding protein composed by two pairs of ef-hand motifs with ubiquitous expression in the nervous system. its over-expression enhances facilitation and increases release per synapse  <cit> . also, the levels of frq in motoneuron control the number of boutons and branching, strongly suggesting a role in modulating axonal growth and bouton formation  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, this calcium sensor is encoded by two different genes, frq <dig> and frq <dig>  <cit> , which are located in tandem in the same genomic region . these two genes show a similar intron-exon structure and a high amino acid sequence similarity . all these features clearly support an origin by gene duplication and suggest that the encoded proteins would still perform similar functions in d. melanogaster. in addition, the prospective search  <cit>  across some fully sequenced genomes failed to detect duplicated copies belonging to this subfamily, with the exception of the zebrafish danio rerio  <cit> . in this species, like in drosophila, there are two independent frequenin encoding genes. in d. melanogaster, both genes have very similar temporal and qualitative expression profiles but their quantitative levels differ  <cit> : while frq <dig> mrna is 2- <dig> fold more abundant at the end of the embryo stage and in 1st instar larvae than in the adult, frq <dig> mrna always reaches its peak expression level in the adult. comparing the mrna expression in the adult, frq <dig> shows a 20-30% higher level than frq <dig>  significant expression in the ventral ganglia was found for both genes, and this expression appears to be specific. interestingly, the reduction or abolishment of frequenin activity in flies does produce neither lethality nor sterility, which originally suggested a small contribution to individual fitness of these proteins. the analyses of over-expression and loss-of-function phenotypes, nevertheless, showed that mutants had larval locomotion defects, deficient synaptic transmission, impaired ca2+ entry and enhanced nerve terminal growth, demonstrating a relevant role of frequenin in the development and function of the nervous system  <cit> .

in order to understand the causes of the atypical preservation of two frq genes in drosophila, we have analyzed nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation of frq <dig> and frq <dig> across the twelve species of the drosophila genus with the complete genome sequenced  <cit> . besides, we have also examined amino acid sequence evolution of the other members of ncs protein family to identify functionally important sites responsible for differentiation between subfamilies. we have found that positive selection had an important role in the fixation of some of the amino acid changes found between drosophila frequenins. the results also show that these changes probably shaped the functional differentiation between the two copies. finally, the evolutionary analysis of non-coding sequences suggests that gene expression differences observed between these two genes might be, at least in part, consequence of the different evolution of regulatory regions after gene duplication.

RESULTS
two old and highly constrained frequenins in drosophila
we have found that the  <dig> drosophila species have two genes encoding frequenin. in all species, the orthologues of frq <dig> and frq <dig> are located in the syntenic region of the x chromosome and maintain nearly the same gene structure . the frq <dig> genes of d. sechellia and d. pseudoobscura are situated in genomic contigs that contain several gaps filled with 'n' and they are not complete. in spite of that, partial coding regions available for these genes have no mutations truncating the open reading frames or generating stop codons, suggesting that both are functional copies. in order to be conservative in our further analysis, however, we used only complete coding regions for comparisons.

both genes show high levels of silent nucleotide divergence across the drosophila genus. the maximum likelihood  estimate of the total tree length  for synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, ds, is  <dig>  and  <dig> , for frq <dig> and frq <dig>  respectively. as expected from an independent evolution after gene duplication, the ml average estimate of synonymous divergence between paralogues  is higher than across orthologues , with little evidence for concerted evolution . surprisingly, despite the extensive divergence at synonymous sites, no nonsynonymous substitution has been detected across orthologous copies of neither frq <dig> nor frq <dig>  in fact, non-synonymous divergence is exclusively restricted to between duplicates , resulting in the  <dig> fixed amino acid differences between frq <dig> and frq <dig> proteins previously detected in  <cit> . furthermore, estimates of silent variation suggest that frq <dig> and frq <dig> have evolved at different evolutionary rate across the drosophila genus since results of the two-cluster test confirm that frq <dig> accumulates synonymous substitutions faster than its paralogue . using beast, we have estimated the age of duplication in  <dig> my , which implies that the two copies originated at some point before the split of the drosophila and sophophora subgenera .

accelerated evolution of frq <dig> in early stages after gene duplication
in contrast to drosophila, the other surveyed insect species hold only one frq gene . all these single insect homologues are co-orthologues of drosophila frq <dig> and frq <dig> , likely indicating that the duplication postdated the split between drosophila and ceratitis relatives. the putative sequence of the ancestral frequenin, reconstructed by a ml approach  using the jtt distance  <cit>  , was used to polarize the  <dig> replacements fixed between duplicates; interestingly, nine of them occurred in the frq <dig> lineage . in fact, amino-acid substitution rate is significantly different between paralogues after duplication , which is consistent with an acceleration of amino-acid substitution rate in frq <dig>  replacements are broadly distributed along the primary structure of frq <dig> with three of them included within ef-hand domains. figure  <dig> shows the location of the residues with nonsynonymous substitutions in the modelled 3d structure. there is no apparent spatial coupling among residues, except for the two pairs that are contiguous  or very close  in the primary structure. we have also investigated the relationship between amino acid substitutions and residue accessibility. we have found that five residues  should be exposed in the frequenin ancestral protein whereas the rest  were probably less accessible. thus, in contrast to the observations for other proteins  <cit> , solvent exposure does not seem to be a major structural determinant of drosophila frequenins residue evolution.

to determine whether functional constraints changed after gene duplication we have performed a ml analysis using the codon substitution models implemented in paml software . the evolutionary scenario allowing different nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates ratio, ω, in the internal branches leading to the frq <dig> and frq <dig> lineages  clearly shows the best-fit to the data . this result implies that selective constraints acting on the two copies changed both immediately after the duplication event and some time before the split of the drosophila genus species. ml estimates of the ω parameter in these lineages  advocate for a relaxation of functional constraints acting on frq <dig> gene just after gene duplication or, alternatively, for the action of positive selection driving some of the replacements found in the protein encoded by this gene.

divergence of non-coding frq <dig> and frq <dig> sequences
the evolutionary fate of duplicated copies can be also determined by changes in non-coding regions . we have analyzed nucleotide divergence at non-coding sequences of frq <dig> and frq <dig> in six species of the sophophora genus. the dot plot of the complete genomic region containing both genes  clearly shows coding exons as the only regions with significant sequence similarity between both genes, i.e. intron and flanking non-coding sequences do not retain signals of the duplication event. in contrast, the phylogenetic shadowing analysis using phastcons reveals a number of significantly conserved non-coding sequences  across species, which might indicate the presence of functional regulatory elements . interestingly, some of these cns are located in the two large introns of these genes , which might have been maintained across drosophila genus because of their functional role. among these cns, we have identified a number of topologically highly accessible transcription factor binding  motives that could be involved in the regulation of frq <dig> and frq <dig> in these species . interestingly, the motives for two factors, dl- <dig>  and brc  are only present in frq <dig> whereas binding sites for eip74ef  appear exclusively in frq <dig>  although a few species have putative binding sites for brc and eip74ef factors in one duplicate, in all cases only one of the sites maintains its position across the subgenus. apart from these differentially distributed tf binding sites, the regulatory regions of frq genes have also highly accessible conserved sites for ubx , hb , sna  and hsp- <dig> . in addition, we have found a number of accessible cns with no apparent tf binding site present in surveyed databases, which might represent regulatory regions for other factors not yet identified.

amino acid sequence evolution in the ncs family
in order to better understand the evolutionary history of frequenin in drosophila, we have also analyzed protein sequence evolution of this subfamily in a large set of bilaterian species. the phylogenetic analysis  with the  <dig> frequenins with complete sequence) shows that frq/ncs- <dig> is a strongly conserved protein - the mean expected number of amino acid substitutions per amino acid site is  <dig> . the most variable positions are outside the ef-hand domains, which are well conserved. the evolutionary rate of positions with changes between drosophila frequenins is variable, some of them being among the most conserved positions . results of the exhaustive search for homologous copies in databases  confirm that duplications are rare in the evolution of this subfamily; in fact, no fixed duplication has been found other than the already known in danio rerio  <cit> . the two zebrafish copies  are noticeably younger than frq <dig> and frq <dig>  i.e. the closest species in our data set with only one frequenin is pimephales pomelas, which diverged from danio rerio 20- <dig> mya  <cit> ; ncs1a and ncs1b differ in  <dig> amino acid positions, but unlike in drosophila, changes have been homogeneously distributed between paralogues after gene duplication .

to evaluate the possibility that amino acid substitutions between frq <dig> and frq <dig> were correlated, we have searched for the presence of coevolving positions across the frq/ncs- <dig> subfamily msa. the analysis based on correlation coefficients  <cit>  does not detect any significant intra-molecular co-evolution across bilaterian frequenins. in contrast, the ctmp model approach  <cit> , allows detecting  <dig> pairs of amino acid sites with significantly more double substitutions than expected under the best-fit amino acid substitution model. the predicted positions are scattered across the sequence and only the c-terminal is free of putative co-evolving positions. no coordinating residues of the ef-hands appear among the sites with high score, with the only exception of position  <dig>  located at the second ef hand. some of the predicted coevolving pairs enclose positions with amino acid differences between frq <dig> and frq <dig> proteins . nevertheless, one of these positions  corresponds to the substitution in the frq <dig> lineage and no significant pair is composed by two sites with replacements in frq <dig> 

we have investigated whether amino acid substitutions between frq <dig> and frq <dig> are actually involved in functional divergence . for that, we extended the analysis to the other ncs subfamilies. the rate of evolution is remarkably different both among subfamilies and between the members of the same ncs class . ncs- <dig> and vilip <dig> are clearly the most conserved subfamilies  whereas gcap subfamilies evolve faster than the rest . the results of the functional divergence analysis in diverge software reveal that positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  have been involved  in functional constraints changes and specific functional divergence between ncs subfamilies . these positions show site-specific shifts of evolutionary rate  and/or of amino acid property . interestingly, although the specific amino acids present in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of frq <dig> and frq <dig> are not the same than those responsible for type ii functional divergence between ncs proteins, they also denote radical changes in frq <dig> . this suggests that they might have been involved in cluster specific functional divergence between frq <dig> and frq <dig>  <cit> . the same occurs with position  <dig>  which imply a radical change in frq <dig>  the putative contribution of the positions  <dig> and  <dig> to functional divergence between subfamilies was unachievable because of the high levels of divergence in the c- and n-terminal parts of the ncs proteins. the rapid evolution of these regions prevented a confident identification of positional homologies for the two sites.

among the amino acid positions replaced between frq <dig> and frq <dig>  positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are the more firm candidates to participate in the functional diversification of the ncs family . these five positions are involved in many independent rate shift changes across the evolution of ncs members, although the particular amino acid residues and the type of divergence depend on the comparison. position  <dig> contributed to the functional divergence between members of the class e and representatives of the classes a and b. positions  <dig> and  <dig> were involved in several rate shift changes associated with functional divergence between all ncs subfamilies and between families belonging to the classes a, b and c, respectively. position  <dig> is a functional diverged site between kchips and other subfamilies, whereas the contiguous position,  <dig>  is among the sites with high posterior probability in different comparisons between all ncs classes. interestingly, these five positions, which involve chemically radical changes between frq <dig> and frq <dig>  also participated  in type ii functional divergence between ncs subfamilies. finally, positions  <dig> and  <dig>  are candidates only for type i functional divergence .

discussion
the ncs family includes members with very different evolutionary rates, which provide insights into their diversification in both structure and function. among these calcium sensors, frq/ncs- <dig> appears to be one of the most conserved subfamilies, not only at the amino acid sequence level but also because of their very low propensity to retain gene duplications - no other fixed duplication has been detected here except in d. rerio. for that reason, the discovery of a fixed and long-term stable  duplication in drosophila, as well as the rapid and heterogeneous accumulation of amino acid changes between duplicates, constitutes a very unusual feature for this family. understanding the basis of this finding may contribute to the better knowledge of molecular evolution of ncs proteins as well as of important fields as the origin and fate of duplicated genes and of functional innovation.

gene duplications arise initially in a single individual and can become fixed in the population by natural selection or by random genetic drift. initially, duplications generate functional redundancy, a situation that is generally non-advantageous; hence, even if duplicates have been fixed by chance, the accumulation of mutations will result in the disruption of structure and function of one of the duplicates, which becomes a pseudogene . results of nucleotide and amino acid variation analyses performed here clearly demonstrate that amino acid changes observed in drosophila frequenins are not the result of this pseudogenization process. the coding sequence of frq <dig> shows strong functional constraints across the drosophila genus as well as within a d. melanogaster population  and none of the nine amino acid substitutions affecting the encoded protein was disruptive, pointing to purifying selection as the main force acting on this gene. in addition, analysis of loss-of-function and over-expression phenotypes also point to the role of both frq <dig> and frq <dig> on synaptic transmission and nerve terminal growth  <cit> .

several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the maintenance of duplicated genes, which consider different mechanisms of preservation and subsequent optimization  <cit> . the main differences among models rely in which part of the gene is involved  and in the relative role of natural selection and genetic drift in determining the outcome of duplication. dealing with protein sequence evolution, two duplicates can be preserved without the action of positive selection just by the selectively neutral division of different subsets of the original functions between daughter copies . nevertheless, this situation is not compatible with present data because of: i) the distribution of mutations after gene duplication is significantly different from the one expected under neutrality, and ii) the strongly selective constrains acting on amino acid positions affected by these mutations across the drosophila genus. we would expect that positions with degenerative mutations removing ancestral functions evolved in a completely neutral way.

the amino acid substitution pattern observed in frq <dig> might result from the fixation of nearly neutral mutations  in an initial period of relaxation, just after gene duplication, followed by a subsequent increase of functional constraints in drosophila. environmental conditions responsible for these constraint changes would affect frq <dig> and frq <dig> in a different way as suggested by the highly biased distribution of amino acid substitutions detected between these paralogues.

accordingly, some functional or regulatory diversification from the native state between drosophila frequenins would be needed. in this context, some models of structural evolution such as compensatory mutations  <cit>  or conformational epistasis  <cit>  might generate the observed evolutionary pattern. in the first, some variants are fixed by positive selection to compensate deleterious mutations in other epistatically interacting positions. under this model, some of the amino acid substitutions in frq <dig> ought to have been selected to maintain protein structure or function rather than be adaptive  <cit> . under the conformational epistasis hypothesis, most of the frq <dig> mutations should have been slightly deleterious or permissive substitutions  that stabilized specific structural elements in this protein allowing further positively selected mutations-which in the absence of previous small-effect mutations should destabilize the protein. these mutations could have conferred a new function and then increased selective constraints in drosophila. although we have found evidences of molecular co-evolution across the frq/ncs- <dig> subfamily, none of the predicted coevolving amino acids involves two positions with replacements in frq <dig>  this finding should rule out structural evolution as the main explanation for the rapid accumulation of amino acid substitutions between duplicates. nevertheless, the probability of observing more double substitutions than expected by chance largely depends on the presence of relatively strong epistatic interactions between mutations. if both frequenins have very few potentially permissive substitutions, the probability of observing repeated pathways across the subfamily should be very low. under this situation, we will have very little power to detect signals of co-evolution between amino acid sites across the alignment. an in-depth experimental study would be needed to analyze the putative contribution of these structural evolution models in generating the pattern observed in drosophila frequenins.

the recurrent fixation of advantageous mutations might also account for the excess of amino acid substitutions in frq <dig>  ml estimate of the dn/ds ratio in the internal branch leading to drosophila frq <dig> sequences is actually higher than in the rest of the branches of the drosophila frq phylogeny. although the estimate is considerably lower than  <dig>  as well as lower than genomic averages reported for the drosophila genus  <cit> , this result does not exclude the possibility that positive selection acted in the fixation of certain frq <dig> changes. it has been largely demonstrated that positive selection commonly acts on few amino acid positions in a protein and, therefore, present estimates based on the complete coding sequence could be too conservatives. frequenin is a highly conserved protein, with very low ω estimates across bilateria  and, therefore, even a significant increase in the number of amino acid changes could not be greatly reflected in the average ω value calculated from the entire protein. in fact, when we applied to the data a much more powerful branch-site approach  <cit> , results were marginally significant . even so, we have to interpret this result with caution because it has been reported that this method often generates false positives under certain conditions  <cit> .

all simple models for the preservation of frq <dig> and frq <dig> in drosophila considered above that are compatible with the existing data require the action of positive selection. thus, the key question that remains unsolved is if natural selection promoted a functional change between frq <dig> and frq <dig> in drosophila. we investigated whether positions differing between paralogues are involved in functional diversification between other members of the ncs family. the fact that many of these positions are candidates to participate in significant amino acid substitution rate shifts between ncs subfamilies suggests that frq <dig> and frq <dig> might have diverged  in their functions. it is difficult to determine, however, the specific functional features that could have diverged between these two proteins. most of the positions with changes between drosophila frequenins are among the most probable functionally diverged residues in many subfamily comparisons. the putative specialized roles in neural function of drosophila frequenins might result from differences in the affinity to ca2+, sub-cellular location or targeted proteins  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that sites of the c-terminal part of the human ncs- <dig> interact with target proteins  <cit> . also, we had shown that the last  <dig> amino acids of the drosophila frq <dig> and frq <dig> act as dominant negative peptide, with effects in synaptic transmission and terminal morphology  <cit> . thus, the two candidate c-terminal positions,  <dig> and  <dig>  might have promoted some diversification in the interaction with target proteins. on the other hand, the replacements observed in these two sites might have also produced changes in ca2+ binding either directly, because they are located in the fourth ef-hand, or by producing structural changes affecting protein thermostability and ca2+ affinity of the other ef-hands  <cit> . the position  <dig> is one of the coordinated residues of the second ef-hand and, therefore, replacements in this site might also be related with ca2+ affinity differences between paralogues. the amino acid fixed in frq <dig> in this position is hydrophilic and highly exposed, in contrast to the hydrophobic and buried ancestor. this feature might indicate a possible structural change produced by the replacement in this position. binding sites for target proteins have been also mapped in the n-terminal part of the human frq/ncs-1protein  <cit> . consequently, substitution in positions  <dig>  might have altered the interaction properties of frq <dig> with some of their partners. the other good candidate to participate in functional divergence between ncs subfamilies, the position  <dig>  is located in the loop connecting the second and third ef-hands. the homologous region in guca <dig> determines the concentration of ca2+ that activates the target of this protein  <cit> . then, the replacement in this position might also affect the ca2+ binding properties of frq <dig>  contributing to the functional divergence of duplicates in drosophila.

finally, in addition to the retention and diversification of protein coding regions, regulatory divergence is also prevalent in the evolution of duplicated genes  <cit> . in fact, it has been proposed that subfunctionalization of regulatory regions can increase the mutational space accessible to duplicates, removing selective constraints and allocating neofunctionalization  <cit> . the mrnas of frq <dig> and frq <dig> are expressed in d. melanogaster with a similar spatio-temporal pattern, but with important quantitative differences  <cit> . these quantitative differences could be related with the significantly different silent evolutionary rate found between these two proteins since it has been shown that gene expression levels are negatively correlated with evolutionary rates  <cit> . here we found that brc and eip74ef factors might be involved in the regulatory divergence of these two duplicates. suitable bcr binding sites are only present in regulatory regions of frq <dig>  in fact, frq <dig> and br   <cit>  mrnas have a very similar expression pattern in late stages of embryo development , coincident with the peak of frq <dig> expression. eip74ef, in contrast, appear only in early metamorphosis, after the major pulse of ecdysone in the third larval instar, being consistent with the higher expression of frq <dig> mrna in adult flies. hence, differences in the response to these two ecdysone-induced early genes might be responsible, at least in part, for the differences in gene expression levels between duplicates. this regulatory diversification might render the action of positive selection suitable, resulting in further functional diversification at the protein level. the current in silico analysis sets the frame of future experimental studies on the regulation of frq <dig> and frq <dig> expression, as well as on the functional mechanisms of the corresponding proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the increasing availability of sequenced genomes from polymorphic to highly divergent taxa has allowed the application of phylogenetic and molecular variation analyses across different time scales. this approach has proven useful to disentangle evolutionary processes that were not completely resolved in previous comparative genomic or population genetics studies. using this approach we found that positive selection, acting on protein sequence evolution, jointly with the diversification of non-coding regulatory sequences, might be the main forces responsible for the origin and preservation of the unusual frequenin duplication in drosophila. the results of this study of variation at the molecular level of frequenin sequences will inspire future experiments on the mechanisms for protein function and gene regulation.
