BACKGROUND
locoweeds are perennial herbaceous plants of the astragalus spp and oxytropis spp. containing the toxic indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine  <cit> . locoism causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry on western grasslands in china and the united states  <cit> . swainsonine, a trihydroxy indolizidine alkaloid, is the primary toxin in locoweeds  <cit> . astragalus and oxytropis species that contain swainsonine are found on multiple continents, and have poisoned animals in south america and asia  <cit> . early studies demonstrated that natural or experimental long-term ingestion of swainsonine-containing plants causes serious disorders in reproductive functions of livestock , including failure to conceive and early embryo loss or abortion, resulting in great economic losses to the livestock industry  <cit> . therefore, various animal models have been used to study the toxic effects of swainsonine on reproduction and development, including goat, sheep and cattle. locoweed poisoning is usually chronic, and the toxic symptoms are observed after a few weeks of locoweed feeding. mice were fed a small quantity of locoweed for four months, demonstrated that pathological and clinical damage to internal organs and neuronal processes were reversible  <cit> . in this study, we then selected four groups of mice to treat with either vehicle control or swainsonine . after treatment with swainsonine for two weeks, female mice were mated to untreated male mice, and pups were kept with dams for one month. we sacrificed dams and offspring and observed swainsonine toxicity effects on internal organs via histopathological analysis as well as altered hematological and blood biochemical parameters in both parent and offspring mice.

discussion
swainsonine, a trihydroxy indolizidine alkaloid, is the main toxin in locoweed. the structure of the swainsonine cation is similar to the structure of mannose, and it has a higher affinity than mannose for mannosidase  <cit> . swainsonine is a well-known inhibitor of lysosomal ɑ-mannosidase and golgi ɑ-mannosidase ii. swainsonine induces toxicity through inhibition of ɑ-mannosidase and subsequent glycoprotein synthesis. this enzymatic dysfunction causes accumulation of complex oligosaccharides in lysosomes as well as the production of a mixture of mannose and asparagine polysaccharides, resulting in vacuolar degeneration in multiple cells  <cit> . clinical symptoms in livestock are characterized by neurological and behavioral disorders, gait abnormalities, difficulty standing, abnormal posture, emaciation, reproductive disorders and cellular vacuolar degeneration of multiple tissues by pathological observation  <cit> . however, we observed two generations of mice and show organ selective vacuolar degeneration by mice given swainsonine via pathological observation. we found hemosiderin deposition in spleen and enlargement of spleen in f <dig> and f <dig> mice, and a large amount of hemosiderin deposition in uterus in f <dig> mice. when animals are fed a dose of swainsonine arrive to a certain time, the vacuolar degeneration of pathological change will show in the internal organs  <cit> . therefore, we think that this experiment period did not arrive to a certain time that vacuolar degeneration found in organ. however, in our previous experiment, we also found hemosiderin deposition in spleen of rat and goat using a different dose of swainsonine  <cit> . we posited that some tissue bleeding occurred after swainsonine administration and found that hemosiderin deposition leads to damage in some tissues. whether the presence of hemosiderin deposition can be used as a pathological marker of swainsonine poisoning requires further research.

the experiment results showed that two ways were not significantly different between irrigation and intraperitoneal injection by liu tianya  <cit> . therefore, we selected the way of intraperitoneal injection for give mice to swainsonine. in this study, we demonstrate that swainsonine exerts hepatotoxicity in f <dig> mice. alterations in liver weight and histopathological changes in liver of swainsonine- treated mice were slight. liver from swainsonine-treated mice showed cellular infiltrates consisting mostly of inflammatory cells and neutrophil granulocytes. significant increase of liver weight and significant alterations in levels of ast, alt and alp in plasma may indicate hepatic injury in f <dig> mice given swainsonine. the elevations of alt, ast and alp observed in swainsonine-treated mice may, in part, be due to the hepatic hypertrophic effect of swainsonine and/or may also represent borderline chronic liver toxicity  <cit> . increased ldh activity levels have been observed in conditions of chemical stress when high levels of energy are required in a short period of time  <cit> . in the present study, ldh was significantly increased in f <dig> mice. however, no significant differences in biochemical markers were found between treatment and control mice f <dig> mice. this is consistent with the lack of histopathological changes in liver of f <dig> mice.

the present study identifies important histological alterations in the spleen in f <dig> and f <dig> mice, namely expansion of red pulp with vascular congestion. furthermore, the endometrium of the uterus displayed notable deposition of hemosiderin granules in a swainsonine-treated dose-dependent manner in f <dig> mice. the molecular weight of swainsonine is small enough to penetrate the placental barrier and expose offspring in-utero. a major function of the spleen is to remove aged and damaged erythrocytes from the blood  <cit> . excess hemosiderin deposition in spleen can result in the destruction of macrophages and the release of the contents such as iron, toxic compounds and/or its metabolites into spleen  <cit> . toxic effects in both f <dig> and f <dig> mice include reduction of rbcs, reduction in levels of hb, hct, plt and mch, as well as an increase in the number of reticulocytes, suggesting the development of anemia  <cit> . significant increases in ibil were observed in f <dig> and f <dig> mice given swainsonine. the increase of ibil further indicates that swainsonine could be damaging red blood cells. when organs bleed, red blood cells are phagocytized by macrophages and degraded by lysosomes; fe3+ of hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells can combine with protein to form hemosiderin. because we observed decreased rbcs, and decreased levels of hb, mch and mcv as well as an increase in reticulocytes, we suspect that our dose levels of swainsonine may lead to anemia.

swainsonine is water-soluble and rapidly distributed to many parts of the body. in previous studies, swainsonine concentrations varied widely in various tissues and organs of sheep that had ingested locoweed  <cit> . in this study, uterus of swainsonine-treated f <dig> mice was heavily damaged. this was characterized by the presence of hemosiderin deposits in the lamina propria of endometrium in uterus of f <dig> mice in this study. in ovary, f0-i and f0-ii mice displayed decreased numbers of primordial and primary follicles compared to f0-iv controls. in addition, f0-i and f0-ii mice displayed increased size and number of corpus lutea compared to f0-iii and f0-iv. the lesions in ovary and uterus were dose-dependently observed in f0-i, f0-ii and f0-iii treatment groups. however, f <dig> did not display notable histopathological changes in the uterus and ovary. swainsonine easily accumulates in uterus at high concentrations, which may impair uterus and ovary function and cause toxicity. in the present study, the uterus suffered noticeable damage, which led to a decline in the rate of conception, an increase in the rate of abortion and increases in stillborn births. it is suspected that significant early embryonic loss occurs in cattle and sheep grazing locoweed, and there are documented effects of swainsonine on oocyte maturation, fertilization and subsequent embryonic implantation and development  <cit> . increased numbers of corpus lutea in ovary can lead to delayed or halted estrus. the pathological lesions we observed, combined with altered hematological and serum biochemical parameters in swainsonine-treated mice, suggest that exposure to swainsonine may lead to inhibition of reproductive performance under certain doses.

CONCLUSIONS
based on sub-chronic toxicity results, our data establishes effects of swainsonine on reproductive toxicity in a mouse model. in addition, we found that swainsonine can cause hematological changes and lesions in spleen, uterus, ovary and liver. furthermore, we provide evidence of trans-generational swainsonine toxicity through placental barrier and milk. spleen, heart, liver, lung, kidney, uterus and ovary were among the organs affected in offspring of dams given swainsonine. large amounts of hemosiderin deposition in uterus and spleen were observed in the parent generation. we present evidence that hemosiderin deposition may preclude vacuolar degeneration in some tissues of mice given swainsonine. alterations in hematological and histopathological parameters suggest a link to anemia and decreases in reproduction ability. our data suggest that anemia and organ-specific hemosiderin deposition followed by destruction of red blood cells are clinical features of swainsonine-treated mice. however, further research is needed to elucidate specific mechanisms of swainsonine toxicity.
