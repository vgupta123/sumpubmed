BACKGROUND
xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  is the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight in rice. bacterial cells on leaf surfaces enters the rice leaf by either swimming passively through the fluid oozing from hydathodes in the morning and spreading systemically in the plant through the xylem, or it enters directly into the xylem through wounds  <cit> . in asia, this disease is the most economically important within the irrigated environment. it appeared in africa in the 1980s, and has since been growing in importance  <cit> . the use of varietal resistance is a highly efficient way of controlling the disease in asia, but, in africa, adequate control methods and deployment of resistant varieties are still lacking. among the prerequisites for finding adequate control strategies are an understanding of the biology of the host-pathogen interaction and the characterization of those genes involved in pathogenicity.

numerous studies  <cit>  have been carried out on the interaction between both host  and pathogen . in asia, xoo shows important variations, as revealed by virulence and dna fingerprinting analyses  <cit> . a race is a group of strains sharing common phenotype of virulence to a set of host cultivars. in the case of xoo near isogenic lines  are being used and more than  <dig> xoo races have been reported in asia so far. new ones are emerging that overcome deployed resistance  <cit> . identification of the genes used by the bacteria to colonize plants may give new insights into the plant defence pathways that are vulnerable to pathogen attack and provide better understanding of the processes in both bacterial pathogenesis and plant immunity.

microarray technology has been widely used to explore transcriptional profiles in plant pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas syringae, ralstonia solanacearum, xanthomonas axonopodis, x. campestris, and xylella fastidiosa  <cit> . these analyses were conducted to study responses to environmental factors such as heat shock, changes in iron bioavailability or carbon sources  <cit> , expression changes related to pathogenesis  <cit> , and biofilm formation  <cit> . another significant field of microarray analysis is that of genome diversity  <cit>  and horizontal gene transfer events  <cit> , using comparative genome hybridization. one example was the recent development of an xanthomonas oryzae 5k oligoarray, with oligos designed according to the sequences of the genomes of asian strains of xoo and x. oryzae pv. oryzicola   <cit> . xoc is the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak, a non-vascular counterpart of xoo  <cit> . xoo and xoc showed differentially expressed genes when grown in enriched versus minimal media  <cit> . for example, the minimal medium xom <dig> induces the in vitro expression of the hrp genes in xoo but not in xoc, presumably by mimicking the ph and nutrient content in the apoplast  <cit> . the great potential of microarray technology was also demonstrated by several other studies that used the technique based on whole or partial plant-bacterial genomes  <cit> . most analyses addressing bacterial gene expression were conducted under in vitro conditions.

strain variations were recently documented in whole-genome analyses of three xoo strains: the korean xoo strain kacc <dig>  <cit> , the japanese xoo strain maff <dig>  <cit> , and the philippine xoo strain pxo99a  <cit> . a whole-genome sequence is also available for one asian xoc strain bls <dig>  several characteristics differentiate the xoo genome from those of other xanthomonads: a higher abundance of is elements, and prevalence of tal effector genes of the avrbs3/ptha family  <cit> . tal genes are widespread among xanthomonas spp., but this family of effectors has expanded specifically in the genomes of asian x. oryzae pathovars. recent studies identified african xoo strains as a significantly different genetic group that appears more closely related to the asian xoc than to asian xoo  <cit> . in contrast to asian xoo strains, african xoo strains show a reduced number of both tal genes and is elements in their genomes  <cit> . african xoo strains induce a non-host hypersensitive response  in tobacco leaves suggesting that these strains display one or several specific non-host hr elicitors, such as type iii effectors or harpins. finally, three new races have been determined among the african strains  <cit> . however, except for the role of one tal effector, almost nothing is known about the specific genetic determinants of pathogenicity in xoo african strains . much remains to be learned about the genes involved in the pathogenicity and virulence of this african pathogen. identification of such genes can improve understanding of how xoo causes disease.

efficient methods for recovering bacterial cells directly from plant tissues permit analyses of in vivo expression in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . conducting gene expression analyses of bacterial pathogens in planta may improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant-pathogen interactions and may help in the early detection of genes involved in pathogenicity  <cit> . because whole genome is not yet available for african xoo strains, we used ssh libraries of xoo strain mai <dig>  <cit>  that were then spotted onto a microarray and used to analyse in planta gene expression at different time points during infection. combining the ssh method, in vivo analysis, and microarrays to study the xoo mai1-rice interaction offers considerable advantages, particularly as in vitro approaches are frequently limited in their ability to mimic all aspects of the in vivo state. aditionally, constructing an xoo mai <dig> microarray, based on ssh dna libraries, allows the enrichment of xoo mai <dig> sequences. hence, the likelihood is higher that the microarray will reveal novel genes involved in xoo-rice infection. although the xoo mai <dig> ssh-microarray does not allow analyses of genome-wide gene expression profiles, specific biological questions can be answered more efficiently, for example, identification of virulence determinants in african xoo strains. in contrast with other large-scale approaches to the study of gene expression in the xanthomonas genus  <cit> , this is the first report to compare bacterial gene expression in planta and at different time points during infection.

RESULTS
bacterial recovery from plant tissues, and rna isolation
we determined xoo mai <dig> multiplication in planta at seven time points after infection into five 2-cm leaf sections . the xoo strain mai <dig> multiplied to a population size of almost 10- <dig> colony-forming units  in section a within  <dig> h after inoculation . thereafter, the population continued increasing until it reached a size of more than 10- <dig> cfu within  <dig> days after inoculation . that is, colonization along the leaf was fast. initially, xoo bacterial cells were concentrated in the first  <dig> cm behind the inoculation point but, within  <dig> dai, they were found in section b. by day  <dig>  the bacterium had colonized more than  <dig> cm, reaching section d. levels of xoo mai <dig> populations increased gradually from sections a to d, reaching 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> cfu per section of leaf by  <dig> dai. by that time, visible lesions were about  <dig> cm long. we selected three time points  and the first 2-cm lesion to perform bacterial rna extractions from leaf tissues for subsequent microarray experiments. possible genomic dna contamination was tested by pcr, using primers corresponding to the genomic region flanking the hrpx  gene and purified rna as pcr template. no dna contamination was found .

differentially expressed genes were identified at late stages of infection
the dna microarray constructed consists of about  <dig> randomly selected clones. the quality of pcr amplification was verified for 20% of the amplified genes , with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the arrays were hybridized with cy labelled cdna probes prepared from total rna from plant-grown bacteria at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai, or from bacteria cultured in media and re suspended in water.

we used bootstrap analysis with sam to identify differentially expressed genes. significance analysis of microarrays  calculates the fold change and significance of differences in expression. the delta-delta ct values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for each time point. the false significant number  ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while the false discovery rate  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . of the  <dig> xoo strain mai <dig> clones analysed,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated. the proportions of differentially expressed genes  remained relatively constant over the first  <dig> days after inoculation but had changed markedly by day  <dig>  with the proportions reversing .

identification of differentially expressed genes
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were one-end sequenced. after eliminating for low quality and vector contamination,  <dig> sequences were obtained. insert size varied between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, with an average of  <dig> bp. the initial data set of  <dig> good sequences was reduced to  <dig> unique consensus sequences, comprising  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. to annotate the xoo mai <dig> non-redundant sequences, we used the gene ontology  functional classification scheme  <cit> . most functionally assigned non-redundant sequences  fell into two classes: proteins with unknown function and biological process unknown . mobile genetic elements, such as phage-related and is elements, were well represented . secretion, transport, and binding proteins, together with virulence-related sequences, represented 14% of the differentially regulated genes .

thirty genes are specifically regulated
the set of  <dig> unique consensus sequences differentially expressed during infection, was searched against the genomes of all available sequenced strains of x. oryzae , and against the draft genome of the african xoo strain bai <dig>  results are summarized in the additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  from these  <dig> genes, eight genes are present only in the african xoo strains mai <dig> and bai <dig>  nine others are also only present in xoo strains mai <dig>  bai <dig>  and pxo99a, and xoc strain bls <dig>  five are present only in xoo strains mai <dig> and bai <dig>  and xoc strain bls <dig> . interestingly, a total of  <dig> xoo mai <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in planta are not present in the asian x. oryzae genomes sequenced so far, indicating that these genes might be specific to the african xoo strain mai <dig>  these mai1-specific genes include  <dig> genes with no similarity to other proteins, two hypothetical proteins, one is element, and three genes related to metabolism .

we selected eight genes to validate their strain specificity, using southern blot hybridization. these included two genes encoding for hypothetical proteins , three genes encoding for proteins with unknown function , a probable secretion protein  and two transposases . in all cases, dna fragments were present in the xoo mai <dig> strain and absent from the corresponding dna driver  . additionally, we tested several other x. oryzae strains from different geographical origins, using fi <dig> as probe, a fragment that is not shared between xoo mai <dig> and other xanthomonas genomes . our findings showed that gene fi <dig> was present only in xoo strain mai <dig> and absent in the other, both african and asian, xoo and xoc strains . those genes corresponding to 'unknown function' may therefore represent interesting candidates for further functional analyses.

cluster analysis of microarray data
a k-means clustering analysis was performed to obtain an overview of the performance of each differentially expressed gene, compared with the others during infection. seven clusters were defined . genes that were up-regulated were represented by clusters  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and cluster  <dig> . down-regulated genes were represented by clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai, respectively. those differentially expressed genes in xoo strain mai <dig>  which are discussed below as related to pathogenicity fell into these clusters.

activation of genes related to adhesion to plant system and plant cell-wall degradation during infection
xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is a vascular pathogen. a critical step in infection is adherence to the host's vascular surfaces  <cit> . electron microscopy analysis during interaction between rice and xoo showed bacterial cells within xylem vessels in both compatible and incompatible interactions after  <dig> dai  <cit> . recently, the use of green fluorescent protein  technology showed that xoo strain pxo <dig> gfp proliferated in susceptible rice lines but not in resistant lines at  <dig> dai  <cit> .

four genes fimbrial assembly protein , pilin , type iv pilin , and the pily <dig> gene  that are associated with bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation were found as up-regulated in xoo mai <dig> in planta at  <dig> dai. these genes belong to cluster  <dig>  type iv pili are bacterial major virulence factors supporting adhesion, surface motility, and gene transfer  <cit> . the role of type iv pili genes in biofilm formation and virulence of phytopathogenic bacteria has been largely studied in the vascular pathogens ralstonia solanacearum and xylella fastidiosa  <cit>  and, most recently, in xoo, xac, and xcc  <cit> . type iv in xoc virulence increased with the presence of two pily <dig> insertion mutants  <cit> . in xylella fastidiosa, disruption of pily <dig> reduced the number of type iv pili and the bacterium's capacity for twitching motility  <cit> . in xoo and xoc, grown on enriched medium, microarray analysis revealed the differential expression of several fimbrial assembly proteins  <cit> . unlike the findings of previous studies which showed the presence of bacterial cells in xylem vessels after  <dig> hai  <cit> , adherence-related genes were found to be induced later  in xoo mai <dig> 

biofilm formation and adherence capacities have been associated with virulence of pathogenic bacteria in xoo, x. axonopodis pv. citri , x. campestris pv. campestris , and others  <cit> . inside plant tissues, biofilms are thought to contribute to virulence by blocking sap flow in the xylem vessels and promoting plant wilt  <cit> . the up-regulated genes involved in biofilm formation and pathogenicity were identified in xylella fastidiosa through microarray analysis, which compared cells growing in a biofilm with planktonic cells  <cit> . in xoo mai <dig>  we identified several of these genes as corresponding to type iv pili genes  and the fimbrial assembly protein  . given that xoo, like xylella fastidiosa, is a restricted vascular pathogen, the induction of genes related to adhesion and motility suggests a role in biofilm formation and vascular colonization. the xoo mai <dig> strain regulates the expression of a group of genes for adherence and biofilm formation in the nutrient-limited environment of xylem in rice. this group's role in pathogenicity should be investigated.

among the up-regulated genes in the xoo mai <dig> strain, we found one cellulase  and one xylanase  gene activated at  <dig> dai . using an ssh approach, qi et al.  <cit>  identified the unique fibrobacter intestinalis genes coding for plant cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes. more than  <dig> cellulases play a major role in f. intestinalis plant cell-wall degradation. an xylanase of xoo was differentially expressed in planta  <cit> . both enzymes  may play a similar role in xoo mai <dig> in degrading rice cell walls, thus facilitating pathogen multiplication.

major virulence genes are up-regulated in planta
five classes of virulence genes were found regulated during infection. they corresponded to three genes related to the avrbs3/pth family , a leucin-rich protein , a virulence regulator , and a xopx  and hrpf gene . most of these major virulence genes fell into cluster  <dig>  corresponding to genes that are activated after  <dig> dai. xoo pathogenicity is highly dependent on the type iii secretion system  injecting effector proteins into the eukaryotic host cell  <cit> . most knowledge on ttss in xoo is based on studies of the large avrbs3/ptha family of xanthomonas effector proteins  <cit> . this family includes proteins with avirulence activities, virulence functions, or both  <cit> . it includes the well-characterized avrxa <dig> protein, which plays a role in bacterial growth and lesion development in rice  <cit> . genes avrxa <dig>  and xopx  are up-regulated at both  <dig> and  <dig> dai. the xopx gene encodes a ttss effector protein and contributes to the virulence of x. campestris pv. vesicatoria on hosts pepper and tomato  <cit> . xopx targets the innate immune response, resulting in enhanced plant disease susceptibility  <cit> . the xopx protein from xcc is required for full virulence, as shown by the xccn mutant that produced weaker disease symptoms than the wild-type strain  <cit> .

the hrpf protein is probably inserted into the plant-cell membrane and may be required for the bacterium's type iii effector proteins to enter host cells  <cit> . as a bacterial translocon, hrpf would therefore be in direct contact with the plant-cell membrane and even possibly subjected to the plant's surveillance mechanisms while it mediates effector protein delivery across the host-cell membrane. to demonstrate that hrpf is required for pathogenicity, sugio et al.  <cit>  used xoo hrpf mutants, which had a reduced ability to either grow within rice plants or cause lesions. for the xoo mai <dig> strain, we found a hrpf gene that was differentially expressed at  <dig> dai during infection. the activation of different genes encoding proteins secreted by ttss  during xoo mai1-rice interaction was consistent with ttss being essential for xoo pathogenicity.

expression of is elements in xoo mai <dig> during infection
insertion sequence  elements have recently been shown to play a role in plant pathogenicity  <cit> . these elements may inactivate genes on insertion or activate and/or enhance the expression of nearby genes  <cit> . one characteristic of the xoo genomes sequenced to date is the accumulation of many is elements, representing as much as 10% of the xoo genome size  <cit> . in xanthomonas spp., virulence and pathogenicity islands are commonly associated with mobile genetic elements such as phages and transposons  <cit> . by comparing gene expression of both xoo and xoc grown in enriched versus minimal medium, seo et al.  <cit>  determined that is elements are differentially expressed in minimal medium.

in our study, we identified  <dig> is elements in xoo mai <dig> that are up- or down-regulated in planta. most of these is elements belong to cluster  <dig>  corresponding to genes that are activated after  <dig> dai. twelve elements were classified into the following is families: is <dig> , is <dig> , and is <dig> , with  <dig> is elements unclassified. members of the is <dig> family have been reported previously in bacterial pathogens and it has been speculated that expression of some pathogenicity genes might be controlled by the expression/insertion of is <dig> family elements  <cit> . expression of is <dig> members in the neighboring region of their hrp gene cluster was observed in pseudomonas syringae  <cit>  it has been also demonstrated that is elements  can act as a mobile switch for the downstream genes, creating new transcriptional promoters and increasing the expression levels of downstream genes  <cit> . members of the is <dig> and is <dig> families have also been reported in bacterial pathogens, some of them controlling the expression of other genetic elements  <cit> . the expression of is elements in xoo mai <dig> in planta suggests that these elements may play a significant role in bacterial pathogenicity or may be associated with genes related to pathogenicity.

to establish a correlation between the presence of is elements and adjacent genes differentially expressed in mai <dig>  we used the draft genome of xoo african strain bai <dig>  and the published genome of xoo strain maff <dig>  <cit> . we compared the location of the  <dig> xoo mai <dig> differentially expressed genes with the presence of adjacent is elements in the xoo bai <dig> and maff <dig> genomes. for this, homologous sequences of is elements, found as differentially expressed in the xoo strain mai <dig>  were first identified in the bai <dig> draft genome. we then extracted  <dig> kb from each of up- and downstream flanking regions of is elements. blast searches were performed against these flanking regions, using the xoo mai <dig> non-redundant set of sequences. for the sequences located within  <dig> kb of sequences flanking the is elements, we compared the relative distance of each sequence to the is element in bai <dig> with the relative distance of their respective homologues in the xoo maff <dig> genome .

homologues of is elements, found as differentially expressed in the african strain mai <dig> of xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  were identified in the xoo bai <dig> draft genome. extractions  were made from up- and downstream flanking regions of is elements. blast searches were performed locally, using the mai <dig> differentially expressed genes. for the sequences located within the 20-kb sequence flanking the is elements, the relative distance of each sequence to the is element in bai <dig> was compared with the relative distance of their respective homologues in the xoo maff <dig> genome. the designation + indicates upstream location of the sequence relative to the is element, and the designation - indicates downstream location. for is elements, gene locations within the 20-kb sequence flanking the is element in bai <dig> and within the genome of xoo maff <dig> are presented.

results showed that homologues of the  <dig> selected xoo mai <dig> differentially expressed genes are located in the vicinity of is elements in bai <dig> genome, within the same 20-kb region . in the xoo maff <dig> genome, xoo mai <dig> differentially expressed genes are not located in a vicinity of  <dig> kb of the is elements. given that the african xoo strain bai <dig> is more closely related to xoo mai <dig> than xoo maff <dig>  a similar organization of is elements and presence of neighbour genes are expected for mai <dig>  correlation between differential expression of is elements, genome location, and role played in the control of expression of nearby genes in african xoo strains need further study.

validation of differentially expressed genes, using qrt-pcr
to validate the xoo mai <dig> microarray results, qrt-pcr was performed on a set of  <dig> genes of different functions and which were up- or down-regulated during infection. table  <dig> lists the primers, putative function, and average fold-change expression of genes used for qrt-pcr validation. the genes selected for qrt-pcr correspond to four hypothetical proteins , one gene showing no similarity to known proteins , two putative transposases , two genes related to transport and motility , one hrpf gene , and one avirulence protein from the avrbs3/ptha family , the avr/pth <dig> gene , the xopx gene , and the avrxa <dig> gene . figure  <dig> shows five genes out of the  <dig> tested that were up-regulated by qrt-pcr and having a larger than 4-fold change. of the  <dig> genes selected according to the microarray data ,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig>  was down-regulated. the qrt-pcr results supported these data, and also showed that the gene expression pattern was identical for all genes tested, except two . gene expression values, however, differed between microarrays and qrt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression values for the five genes fi <dig>  fi <dig>  fi <dig>  af <dig>  and acd <dig> were higher in qrt-pcr than for microarray, indicating that qrt-pcr may be more sensitive than microarray analysis. the xopx gene  was highly up-regulated in xoo strain mai <dig> in planta, indicating that induction of this gene is important during interaction between xoo strain mai <dig> and rice. these five genes belonged to cluster  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
sustainable control measures for bacterial blight in africa will depend on understanding and characterizing those of the microbe's genes involved in the rice-xoo interaction. we therefore focused our study on analysing and characterizing xoo mai <dig> at the transcriptional level. for this we constructed a xoo mai <dig> ssh array, performed in planta gene expression analysis and selected and validated by qrt-pcr various gene expressions to generate robust and reliable data. although the ssh microarray may not be as sensitive as qrt-pcr for some genes, results included several candidate genes whose regulation and function will need to be elucidated to better understand the xoo-rice interactions.

our study shows that the regulation of gene expression in the xoo strain mai <dig> is controlled at different time points during pathogen infection. we identified conserved mechanisms for which some were reported in other xoo-plant interactions but not yet described for african strains. we also identified differentially regulated genes specific to the xoo strain mai <dig>  several homologues of xoo mai <dig> differentially expressed genes were located in the vicinity of is elements in the xoo bai <dig> genome. the role played by these is elements in controlling neighbouring-gene expression needs to be elucidated. more data on african xoo strains also need to be generated. recently, the sequencing of various african xoo and xoc strains has been initiated at our laboratory and others. with this information, the full-length cdna of desired genes can be easily obtained and their specific functions in pathogenicity studied, using available gene knockout technology. functional characterization of the proteins/genes related to virulence will be of particular importance in understanding the complex interaction between xoo mai <dig> and rice. our work constitutes a significant contribution towards the biology of an emerging and devastating pathogen under a specific, but insufficiently studied, environment in west africa.
