BACKGROUND
histone deacetylase  proteins play a critical role in regulating gene expression in vivo by altering the accessibility of genomic dna to transcription factors. specifically, hdac proteins remove the acetyl group of acetyl-lysine residues on histones, which can result in nucleosomal remodelling  <cit> . due to their governing role in gene expression, hdac proteins are associated with a variety of cellular events, including cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and cancer development  <cit> . in fact, hdac inhibitors reduce tumour growth in various human tissues, including lung, stomach, breast, and prostrate  <cit> . as a result, small molecule inhibitors of hdac enzymatic activity are currently being exploited as potential cancer drugs  <cit> .

the study of hdac proteins in cancer is complicated by the identification of eleven human hdac proteins that are sensitive to small molecule inhibitors  <cit> . although it is unclear which of the eleven hdac proteins is involved in cancer formation, the activity of hdac <dig> has been linked to cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer. particularly, mammalian cells with knock down of hdac <dig> expression using sirna were antiproliferative  <cit> . while the knock out mouse of hdac <dig> was embryonic lethal, the resulting stem cells displayed altered cell growth  <cit> . mouse cells overexpressing hdac <dig> demonstrated a lengthening of g <dig> and m phases and reduced growth rate  <cit> . therefore, the reported data implicate hdac <dig> in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation.

to further elucidate hdac <dig> function in vivo, hdac <dig> associated proteins have been characterized by biochemical purification. hdac <dig> exists in at least three distinct biochemical complexes. the nurd complex includes a core complex comprised of hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  retinoblastoma associated protein  <dig> , rbap <dig>  as well as mi <dig>  methyl cpg binding domain  <dig>  and metastasis associated protein  <dig>   <cit> . the fact that the nurd complex contains mta <dig>  which is associated with cancer metastasis, provides further evidence that hdac <dig> may play a role in cancer development. the sin <dig> complex comprises the core complex as well as msin <dig>  sin <dig> associated protein  <dig> , sap <dig>  and sds <dig>  <cit> . finally, the corest complex is less well characterized and contains hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  corest, and p <dig>   <cit> . the presence of associated proteins promotes the enzymatic activity of hdac <dig>  specifically, coexpression of mta <dig> of the nurd complex with the core hdac1-containing complex resulted in augmented deacetylase activity  <cit> . most recently, knockdown of sds <dig> of the sin <dig> complex resulted in reduced deacetylase activity of hdac <dig> immunoprecipitates in mammalian cells  <cit> .

hdac <dig> protein association and activity are also promoted by phosphorylation. hdac <dig> is phosphorylated at s <dig> and s <dig>  <cit> , although additional phosphorylated sites are also possible  <cit> . single or double mutation of s <dig> and s <dig> disrupted hdac <dig> interactions with members of the sin <dig>  nurd, and corest complexes, including rbap <dig>  msin3a, mta <dig>  and corest  <cit> . in addition, single or double mutation of s <dig> and s <dig> reduced deacetylase activity. while single or double mutants of hdac <dig> appear functionally similar, the evidence suggests that hdac <dig> is phosphorylated at both s <dig> and s <dig> in vivo  <cit> . additional experiments are necessary to reveal the functional significance of double phosphorylation of hdac <dig> 

to explore the role of phosphorylation in promoting hdac <dig> activity and protein association, we have performed a limited trypsin proteolysis of hdac <dig>  because the conformation and/or protein associations of hdac <dig> are likely related to proteolysis sensitivity, we hypothesized that concentration-dependent trypsin digestion will change as a function of phosphorylation state. we found that hdac <dig> mutants lacking phosphorylation at both s <dig> and s <dig> displayed different proteolysis sensitivities than wild type hdac <dig>  interestingly, hdac <dig> mutants lacking only one phosphorylated residue displayed proteolysis sensitivities similar to wild type hdac <dig>  the limited proteolysis study suggests that phosphorylation of s <dig> and s <dig> individually contribute to hdac <dig> function.

RESULTS
limited trypsin digestion of endogenous hdac1
as a first step towards characterizing the protease sensitivity of hdac <dig>  endogenous hdac <dig> from human jurkat cells was immunoprecipitated and incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin . the trypsin digestion products were separated using sds-page and hdac <dig> was visualized using an anti-hdac <dig> antibody recognizing the c-terminus . for clarity, the lowest concentration of trypsin  is indicated as 1x and, accordingly, the highest concentration  as 16x. a trypsin concentration of 80x  was also used to digest hdac <dig> completely, as a positive control. endogenous hdac <dig> showed concentration-dependent cleavage by trypsin . the concentration of trypsin required to degrade roughly half of the full-length protein was 4x . interestingly, western blot analysis did not show a protease fragmentation pattern with endogenous hdac1; only full length hdac <dig> was observed with all concentrations of trypsin. because the hdac <dig> antibody only recognizes the c-terminus of the protein, we also analyzed the reactions products by silver staining. again, no protein fragments associated with hdac <dig> degradation were observed . additional conditions including varying temperatures  and varying reaction times  were tested with only full length hdac <dig> observed . the results suggest that hdac <dig> is digested by trypsin to short peptide fragments, which are not identifiable by gel methods.

to support the observation that hdac <dig> degrades to short peptide fragments in the presence of trypsin, the predicted sites of hdac <dig> trypsin cleavage were determined using the program peptide cutter  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> trypsin cleavage sites were identified with the largest likely fragments to be  <dig> amino acids with a mass of roughly  <dig>  kda . the predicted tryptic map of hdac <dig> corroborates the proteolysis results suggesting that hdac <dig> degrades to small peptide fragments in the presence of trypsin.

limited trypsin digestion of transiently expressed hdac1
in preparation for testing hdac <dig> phosphorylation site mutants, we first validated the use of transiently expressed hdac1-flag fusion protein  in concentration-dependent proteolysis experiments. immunoprecipitated hdac1-f was treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin, as described for endogenous hdac <dig>  like endogenous hdac <dig>  roughly half of the protein was degraded with 4x concentration of trypsin . therefore, the data revealed that hdac1-f demonstrated similar concentration-dependent cleavage by trypsin as endogenous hdac <dig> 

to allow a more rigorous comparison of the concentration-dependent cleavage, the amount of full-length protein present after incubation with each concentration of trypsin was quantified and compared to the amount of protein present in the absence of trypsin . consistent with visual observations,  <dig> ± 14% of endogenous hdac <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> % of expressed hdac1-f remained in the presence of 4x trypsin . the quantitative analysis reinforces the conclusion that endogenous hdac <dig> and expressed hdac1-f display similar concentration-dependent degradation by trypsin.

like with endogenous hdac <dig>  no proteolytic fragments of hdac1-f were observed in these studies , consistent with the production of small peptides upon degradation. to corroborate the possibility that complete hdac <dig> degradation occurs with proteolysis, we assessed the enzymatic activity of hdac <dig> after incubation with increasing concentrations of trypsin . like the proteolysis experiments, hdac <dig> enzymatic activity was reduced in a trypsin concentration-dependent manner. the linear relationship between trypsin proteolysis and enzymatic activity  is consistent with the scenario that hdac <dig> degrades to small peptide fragments in the presence of trypsin.

limited trypsin digests of hdac <dig> phosphorylation site double mutants
to probe the influence of hdac <dig> phosphorylation on trypsin sensitivities, two hdac <dig> mutants with disrupted phosphorylation at s <dig> and s <dig> were tested- the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a double mutant lacks the serine hydroxyl groups that are phosphorylated and the hdac <dig> e424a/e426a double mutant lacks the ck <dig> recognition sequence required for phosphorylation in vivo. previous work showed that the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutants behave similarly; both mutants are unable to interact with rbap <dig>  sin3a, mta <dig>  and corest and are catalytically inactive, demonstrating  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of wild type activity, respectively  <cit> .

transiently expressed hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutants were incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin, as described for the hdac1-f . quantification of the western blot analysis  revealed that hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutants display  <dig> ±  <dig>  % and  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of full-length protein, respectively, in the presence of 4x trypsin . the experiments demonstrated that the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutant proteins display equivalent concentration-dependent trypsin digestion, consistent with previous results showing that they maintain similar deacetylase activity and complex forming ability  <cit> .

while the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutants maintain similar trypsin sensitivities, they demonstrated significant differences in concentration-dependent trypsin digestion compared to wild-type hdac <dig> . quantification revealed that  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of wild-type protein compared with  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutants was observed in the presence of 4x trypsin . even more dramatically, the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutant proteins were sensitive to degradation with 1x trypsin , whereas the wild-type hdac <dig> was almost completely insensitive to degradation at that concentration . the data show that the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a and hdac <dig> e424a/e426a mutants are more sensitive to trypsin digestion than wild-type hdac <dig> 

limited trypsin digests of hdac <dig> phosphorylation site single point mutants
similar to the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a double mutant, single point hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a mutants are catalytically inactive, demonstrating  <dig> ±  <dig>  % and  <dig> ±  <dig>  % activity compared to wild type hdac <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in addition, hdac <dig> s421a/s423a, s421a and s423a mutants similarly lack the ability to bind rbap <dig>  msin <dig>  mta <dig>  and corest. because the single and double point mutants display similar activities and protein associations, the expectation was that the s421a and s423a single point mutants would demonstrate similar trypsin sensitivities compared to the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a double mutant.

concentration-dependent trypsin digestion was performed with transiently expressed hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a, as described previously . quantitative analysis of the western blots  indicated that both mutants displayed similar amounts of full-length protein at every concentration of trypsin . whereas hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a displayed nearly identical concentration-dependent trypsin digestion sensitivities, they demonstrated significantly different trypsin sensitivities compared to the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a double mutant. while the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a double mutant was almost completely degraded at 4x trypsin concentration , the hdac <dig> s421a and s423a mutants were only partially degraded . instead, the s421a and s423a single point mutants displayed similar trypsin sensitivities to the wild type hdac1-f protein. for example, while hdac1-f was partially degraded  with 4x trypsin concentration, the hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a single point mutants were also partially degraded . in fact, only with 1x trypsin concentration did hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a single point mutants show differences compared with wild-type hdac1; the single point mutants displayed  <dig> ±  <dig> % or  <dig> ±  <dig> % full length protein, which is roughly of an intermediate degradation compared to wild-type hdac <dig>  or hdac <dig> s421a/s423a . therefore, the comparison revealed an unexpected similarity between the trypsin sensitivities of wild type hdac1-f and the hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a single point mutants.

limited trypsin digests of hdac <dig> kinase consensus site single point mutants
to reinforce the observations with hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a single point mutants, the ck <dig> consensus site single point mutant hdac <dig> e424a and hdac <dig> e426a were also studied. like hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a, mutation of e <dig> and e <dig> resulted in reduced enzymatic activity, demonstrating  <dig> ±  <dig>  % and  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of wild type activity, respectively  <cit> . unlike hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a, the hdac <dig> e424a and hdac <dig> e426a mutants bind to rbap <dig> and msin <dig>  although only e424a binds with comparable affinity to the wild-type hdac <dig> protein. because hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a mutants demonstrated similar trypsin sensitivities to wild type hdac <dig>  the expectation was that hdac <dig> e424a and hdac <dig> e426e would also.

concentration-dependent trypsin digestion was performed with the hdac <dig> e424a and hdac <dig> e426a single point mutant  and western blot analysis indicated that both mutants degraded similarly to hdac1-f  . while hdac1-f was partially degraded  with 4x trypsin concentration, the hdac <dig> e424a and hdac <dig> e426a single point mutants were also partially degraded . while e424a was degraded to the same extent as wild-type hdac <dig> at 1x trypsin , e426a displayed slightly reduced digestion compared to wild-type hdac <dig> . the data with hdac <dig> e424a and hdac <dig> e426a are consistent with studies of hdac <dig> s4231a and hdac <dig> s423a, demonstrating similar trypsin sensitivities compared with wild type hdac <dig> 

limited trypsin digestion of h141a hdac <dig> mutant
in addition to probing the phosphorylation-dependent changes in hdac <dig> conformations, we explored the use of limited proteolysis to assess the conformational changes of a hdac <dig> catalytic site mutant. crystallography of human hdac <dig> and two hdac homologs from bacteria  have implicated a metal ion along with two conserved histidines in hdac catalytic activity  <cit> . consistent with the proposal, mutation of h <dig> results in loss of hdac <dig> deacetylase activity  <cit> . although the h141a mutant is catalytically inactive, it maintains full binding to rbap <dig> and msin <dig>  to determine if trypsin sensitivities are altered by catalytic amino acid mutation, we tested the concentration-dependent trypsin digestion of the hdac <dig> h141a mutant . the trypsin degradation of hdac <dig> h141a was identical to that of hdac1-f at every concentration of trypsin tested  . the data indicate that trypsin sensitivities are not altered by catalytic amino acid mutation, which influence enzymatic activity but not protein associations.

discussion
structural insight into human hdac <dig> is lacking. nmr, cd, or crystallographic characterization have been challenging due to the low quantities and contamination with associated proteins typical of mammalian cell-derived hdac <dig>  <cit> . in addition, most hdac proteins, including hdac <dig>  cannot be isolated in active form from bacteria  <cit> . unlike other methods, limited proteolysis assays allow analysis of hdac <dig> from mammalian sources because low concentrations and the presence of associated proteins are tolerated  <cit> . in addition, hdac <dig> isolated from mammalian cells can be probed in its natural state in vivo, including its various states of post-translational modification and activity. limited proteolysis has been used previously to distinguish structurally accessible from inaccessible conformations of proteins, revealing function domains  <cit> , and to assess protein stability  <cit> . despite the utility of the method, no report to date has explored the limited proteolysis of hdac <dig> 

we sought to investigate limited proteolysis as a means of characterizing hdac <dig> structure. as a first step, we performed digestions with increasing concentrations of trypsin using hdac <dig> isolated from human jurkat cells. while hdac <dig> was degraded by trypsin, no evidence of distinct fragments was detected under any reaction conditions . presumably, hdac <dig> degraded to small peptides undetectable by gel electrophoresis . because hdac <dig> degraded without production of discrete fragments, the data suggest that the hdac <dig> structure lacks distinct domains of protease-resistance. rather, the data are consistent with a model where hdac <dig> comprises inter-related regions that cooperate to maintain overall structure and function. this model is corroborated by previous work documenting the temperature sensitivity of hdac <dig> activity  <cit> .

previous studies with human sirt <dig> and maize zm-hda <dig> demonstrated that post-translational proteolysis gave rise to enzymatically active forms of the proteins  <cit> . because hdac <dig> proteolysis by trypsin did not produce discrete fragments, the results suggest that hdac <dig> is not subjected to the same proteolytic processing as sirt <dig> and zm-hda <dig>  however, it is possible that alternative proteases are required for hdac <dig> proteolysis in vivo.

because no discrete protease fragments were detected with hdac <dig>  we focused the studies on analyzing the concentration-dependent degradation of hdac <dig> by trypsin  <cit> . since hdac <dig> phosphorylation promotes hdac <dig> enzymatic activity and protein associations  <cit> , we studied hdac <dig> mutants lacking phosphorylation sites. we hypothesized that unphosphorylated hdac <dig> mutants would give different concentration-dependent degradation than wild-type hdac <dig> if interaction with associated proteins or enzymatic inactivity govern proteolysis susceptibility. we found that hdac <dig> phosphorylation site mutants were significantly more sensitive to trypsin digestion compared to wild type hdac <dig> , suggesting that hdac <dig> trypsin sensitivity correlates with the interaction with associated proteins, enzymatic activity, or both.

to decipher whether sensitivity to trypsin correlates with hdac <dig> enzymatic activity and/or protein association, we performed trypsin digestion experiments with a variety of single point mutants- s421a, s423a, e424a, e426a, and h141a. because each of the single point mutants has a differing enzymatic activity and propensity to interact with associated protein, the combined data was expected to reveal the factors governing trypsin sensitivities. multiple experiments indicate that the trypsin sensitivity of hdac <dig> is not correlated with enzymatic activity. while all single point mutants are less active than wild-type hdac <dig>  they all demonstrated similar trypsin digestion to wild-type hdac <dig>  most significantly, the hdac <dig> h141a mutant is inactive due to mutation of a catalytic histidine, yet it displays identical trypsin digestion compared to wild-type hdac <dig> . therefore, the data suggest that the heightened susceptibility of the hdac <dig> s421a/s423a mutant to trypsin digestion does not correlate with enzymatic inactivity.

the experiments with the single point mutants are also helpful in illuminating the role of protein association in governing trypsin digestion susceptibilities. unlike wild type hdac <dig>  all of the phosphorylation site single point mutants have reduced ability to interact with rbap <dig>  msin <dig>  mta <dig>  and corest. consequently, if associations with rbap <dig>  msin <dig>  mta <dig>  and corest dictate trypsin susceptibility, the expectation was that the wild type and single point mutants would display significantly different sensitivities to trypsin. the data indicated that the single point mutants displayed trypsin sensitivities similar to wild type hdac1-f, with only a modest difference with 1x concentration of trypsin. while differences in trypsin sensitivities at 1x concentration may result from association with rbap <dig>  msin <dig>  mta <dig>  and corest, the data indicate that vulnerability to trypsin digestion is independent of rbap <dig>  msin <dig>  mta <dig>  and corest at high concentrations of trypsin.

previous work found that binding with sin <dig>  rbap <dig>  mta <dig>  and corest was lost whether hdac <dig> was singly or doubly mutated at s <dig> and s <dig>  conjuring the possibility that phosphorylation at either site is functionally redundant in vivo  <cit> . if singly and doubly phosphorylated hdac <dig> proteins are functionally indistinguishable, the expectation was that their trypsin sensitivities would be similar as well. the data indicated that the single and double phosphorylation site mutants demonstrated significant differences in proteolysis sensitivities at all trypsin concentration tested. the fact that the single and double point mutants differ in their protease susceptibilities suggests a model where each phosphorylation event individually contributes to hdac <dig> activity. because hdac <dig> associates in vivo with multiple proteins, it is attractive to hypothesize that unphosphorylated hdac  is distinguished from singly phosphorylated hdac <dig> via differing protein interactions. for example, in addition to interaction with proteins in the sin <dig>  nurd, and corest complexes  <cit> , hdac <dig> directly interacts with transcription factors, such as retinoblastoma protein  <cit> , estrogen receptor alpha  <cit> , and sp <dig>  <cit> . while additional studies are necessary to unambiguously identify the phosphorylation-dependent events that correlate with proteolysis susceptibility, the limited proteolysis studies provide evidence that singly phosphorylated hdac <dig> is distinguishable from unphosphorylated hdac <dig> 

the limited proteolysis provides a secondary assay to confirm that mutagenesis does not result in the global instability and unfolding of the protein  <cit> . for example, the limited proteolysis demonstrated that hdac <dig> s421a and hdac <dig> s423a maintain similar sensitivities to proteolysis compared to wild type hdac <dig> even though they are catalytically inactive and unable to interact with associated proteins. therefore, limited proteolysis analysis provides a general assay for assessing hdac <dig> protein stability.

previous work showed that phosphorylation at s <dig> and s <dig> promotes the full enzymatic activity and protein associations of hdac <dig>  explaining these results, two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were proposed  <cit> . the first hypothesis suggests that phosphorylation at s <dig> and s <dig> causes a conformational change, which promotes protein association and augments enzymatic activity. the second hypothesis posits that hdac1-dependent phosphorylation promotes protein associations, which results in augmented enzymatic activity. while it is formally possible that phosphorylation may result in subtle structural rearrangements undetectable by limited proteolysis, the data are consistent with the possibility that protein associations promote hdac <dig> enzymatic activity. a model of associated protein-promoted hdac <dig> activity is strengthened by experiments where coexpression of mta <dig> with the hdac1/hdac <dig> core complex resulted in augmented deacetylase activity  <cit> . therefore, the results with limited proteolysis reinforce the close relationship between protein association and enzymatic activity in regulating hdac <dig> function.

CONCLUSIONS
limited proteolysis experiments were performed with hdac <dig> for the first time. because discrete hdac <dig> fragments were not observed upon degradation with trypsin, the data suggest that hdac <dig> contains a contiguous structure cooperating to maintain activity. concentration-dependent proteolysis with hdac <dig> phosphorylation site mutants demonstrated that trypsin sensitivities vary with extent of phosphorylation. as a result, these studies provide the first evidence that phosphorylation of s <dig> or s <dig> individually contribute to hdac <dig> function. finally, the data are consistent with a model where hdac <dig> catalytic activity is promoted by protein associations.
