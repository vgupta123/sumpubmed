BACKGROUND
corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causative agent of diphtheria, a toxaemic localized infection of the respiratory tract. by vaccination diphtheria is well-controlled in e. g. western europe  <cit> ; however, this disease is still a cause of morbidity and mortality in less developed countries. while the production of diphtheria toxin has been well-established as a major virulence factor, little is known about c. diphtheriae factors crucial for colonization of the host and corresponding host receptors recognized by these factors, although colonization is an essential step of pathogenicity.

in the last decades it has become evident that c. diphtheriae is not only the aetiological agent of diphtheria, but can cause other infections. non-toxigenic strains have been increasingly documented  <cit>  and found to be the cause of invasive diseases such as endocarditis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, spleen abscesses, and septic arthritis . these systemic infections caused by c. diphtheriae suggest that this pathogen is not only able to attach to host epithelial cells, but must be able to gain access to deeper tissues by unknown portals of entry and to persist in these tissues.

a possible clue for the background of persistence of c. diphtheriae came from investigations of adherence and invasion of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. using a combination of gentamicin protection assays and thin-section electron microscopy, hirata and co-workers  <cit>  showed that toxigenic c. diphtheriae were not only able to adhere to laryngeal hep- <dig> cells, but also enter these cells and survive after internalization. similar observations were made for non-toxigenic strains  <cit>  showing that also pharyngeal detroit  <dig> cells can be invaded by c. diphtheriae. in this study, living intracellular bacteria were detected up to  <dig> h after infection.

while host cell receptors and invasion-associated proteins of the pathogen are still unknown, bacterial adhesion factors have been recently at least partially characterized on the molecular level. c. diphtheriae is able to assemble three distinct pili on its surface. mutant analyses showed that the spaa-type pilus is sufficient for adhesion to pharynx cells, shaft proteins are not crucial for pathogen-host interaction, while adherence to pharyngeal cells is greatly diminished when minor pili proteins spab and spac are lacking  <cit> . the results obtained in this study also indicated the existence of other proteins besides pili subunits involved in adhesion to larynx, pharynx, and lung epithelial cells, since a total loss of attachment to pharyngeal cells due to mutagenesis of pili- and sortase-encoding genes could not be observed and attachment to lung or larynx cells was less affected by the mutations. this is in line with a number of studies suggesting the multi-factorial mechanism of adhesion . furthermore, hirata and co-workers  <cit>  described two distinct patterns of adherence to hep- <dig> cells, a localized and a diffuse form, an observation that hint also to the existence of several adhesion factors. this idea is in accordance with the situation in other bacteria such as salmonella enterica where a high number of different factors are crucial for pathogenesis  <cit> . the involvement of different c. diphtheriae proteins to adherence to distinct cell types is further supported by work on adhesion to human erythrocytes, showing that non-fimbrial surface proteins 67p and 72p, which were up to now only characterized by their mass, are involved in this process  <cit> . interestingly, besides strain-specific differences in adherences , also growth-dependent effects were observed. in a study using two toxigenic c. diphtheriae strains and erythrocytes as well as hep- <dig> cells, de oliveira moreira and co-workers  <cit>  showed an effect of iron supply on hemagglutination and lectin binding properties of the microorganisms. also in this study, strain-specific differences in adherence were detected.

while pathogen factors responsible for adhesion are at least partially known, the molecular background of invasion is more or less unclear. since we were interested in this process, we started a functional genetics approach to identify proteins involved in invasion, based on a recently published work presenting a comprehensive analysis of proteins secreted by c. diphtheriae  <cit> . in this study, we focused on one of these identified proteins, the surface-associated protein dip <dig>  a member of the nlpc/p <dig> family  <cit> . nlpc/p <dig> proteins define a large superfamily of several diverse groups of proteins including putative proteases and probably invasion-associated proteins. they are found in bacteria, bacteriophages, rna viruses, and eukaryotes and various members are highly conserved among non-pathogenic and pathogenic corynebacteria  <cit> . c. diphtheriae protein dip <dig> was, as its homologs ce <dig>  cg <dig>  and jk <dig> in corynebacterium efficiens, corynebacterium glutamicum, and corynebacterium jeikeium, previously annotated as hypothetical invasion-associated protein and was therefore in the focus of this study.

RESULTS
adhesion and invasion of c. diphtheriae wild type and mutant strains
as a basis for further analyses of dip <dig> mutants, strains iss <dig> and iss <dig>  which were already shown to be adhesion- and invasion-competent  <cit> , were tested for adhesion to and internalization in detroit <dig>  cells. using a slightly modified protocol  with increased number of washing steps, we were able to generate highly reproducible infection conditions . in these experiments, strain iss <dig> showed a higher number of adherent bacteria compared to strain iss <dig> , while statistically relevant differences of the number of invaded epithelial cells were not observed .

after establishing infection conditions for the wild-type strains, dip <dig> gene disruption mutants lilo <dig>  and lilo <dig>  were analyzed. dip <dig> mutant strains lacked the ability to adhere to host cells almost completely  and in contrast to the wild-type no internalized bacteria were detectable for strain lilo <dig> and lilo <dig> .

basic characterization of dip <dig> mutant strains
microscopic inspection of the mutant strains revealed unexpectedly an increased size of the single bacteria in combination with an altered less club-like shape and formation of chains of bacteria rather than the typical v-like division forms or palisades of clustered c. diphtheriae. immuno-fluorescence microscopy carried out for control verified that observation . additionally, this approach showed an uneven, speckled staining of the mutants, indication an altered surface structure compared to the wild-type strains.

to analyse, if all bacteria within the observed chains of mutants were still viable or if changes were correlated with detrimental effects on survival of bacteria, we carried out live/dead staining. no significant differences were observed between wild-type and mutants in respect to viability, in all cases the majority of bacteria were fully viable and exclusively stained by syto <dig> green and not by propidium iodide . during manipulation of bacteria , we observed that chains of mutants were occasionally broken down to smaller units. using live/dead staining, we could show that disruption of chains by vigorous vortexing  was not detrimental to the bacteria , indicating that mutant strains have a fully functional and rigid peptidoglycan layer.

for all strains, iss <dig>  iss <dig>  lilo <dig> and lilo <dig>  identical doubling times of about  <dig> min were observed. interestingly, with a final optical density  of approx.  <dig>  the mutants reached a more than fourfold higher od <dig> compared to the corresponding wild-type strains, which reached final optical densities between  <dig>  and  <dig>  this observation corresponds nicely with the increased colony size of the mutants  and suggests that the altered bacterial size and form has no severe impact on light scattering and consequently od measurement.

analysis of surface proteins
since we assumed that the altered shape of the mutants might be correlated with an altered cell surface, especially in the light of the immuno-fluorescence microscopy approach , which showed a different antibody binding compared to the wild-type, we isolated the surface proteins of wild-type and mutant strains. when these were subjected to sds-page and silver staining, significant differences in protein patterns were observed . compared to the protein bands of the wild-type strains, dip <dig> mutants showed a decrease of bands in the upper molecular weight range accompanied by an increased number of bands in the lower molecular weight range. these changes were confirmed, when western blot experiments were carried out , which also showed a dramatic change and decrease of immuno-reactive bands. as a third experimental approach to analyse surface proteins, 2-d page was carried out . as in the sds-page experiments, the mutant showed a decrease of proteins in the upper molecular weight range and an increased number of spots in the lower molecular weight range. furthermore, in comparison to the wild-type, the mutant showed a dramatic increased number of multiple spots. the molecular background of these multiple protein forms is unclear.

surface structure of wild-type and mutant strains
the altered immuno-staining of the mutant strain surfaces and the clear differences of wild-type and mutant protein patterns revealed by sds-page and 2-d page prompted us to perform a more detailed investigation of the cell surface of c. diphtheriae by atomic force microscopy. compared to the surface structure of c. glutamicum, which was investigated for several strains in great detail by atomic force microscopy  <cit> , c. diphtheriae shows a more structured surface . furthermore, striking differences were observed when the cell surface of different c. diphtheriae strains was examined. in the wild-type strain iss <dig>  round elevations with a lateral diameter of 10- <dig> nm and a height of 1- <dig> nm can be seen . the complementary phase images, which reflect adhesive and elastic tip-sample interactions, show a similar, highly structured surface structure . in the mutant strain lilo <dig> , a loss of this fine structure was observed: elongated elevations can be seen with a width of 50- <dig> nm . their height is similar as in the case of the wild-type strain. differences in surface structure are especially obvious when comparing the complementary phase images . analyses of strains iss <dig> and lilo <dig> gave similar results .

discussion
in this study, the function of the surface-associated protein dip <dig>  a member of the nlpc/p <dig> family was investigated, which was annotated as hypothetical invasion-associated protein. by fluorescence staining and atomic force microscopy, we could show that dip <dig> mutations cause formation of chains of bacteria, rearrangements of cell surface structures, and dramatic changes in protein patterns. our data indicate that dip <dig> is not crucial for the separation of the peptidoglycan layer of dividing bacteria, since disruption of chains did not decrease the viability of bacteria. consequently, dip <dig> function seems to be limited to the outer protein layer of c. diphtheriae, which is not uniformly organized in a surface layer lattice, but comprises more than  <dig> different proteins  <cit> . if the other nlpc/p <dig> family members in c. diphtheriae besides dip <dig>  namely dip <dig>  dip <dig>  and dip <dig>  <cit>  have similar functions in cell surface layer organization is unknown and has to be investigated in future projects.

tsuge and co-workers reported cell separation defects in corynebacterium glutamicum r, when the dip <dig> homolog cgr_ <dig> and another member of the nlpc/p <dig> protein family cgr_ <dig> were mutated  <cit> . also in this study, cell separation was not impaired in respect to separation of peptidoglycan and mycolic acid layers of daughter cells, but mainly restricted to the surface protein layer of the bacteria. however, using transmission electron microscopy of thin sections of cells, in this study also formation of multiple septa within single bacteria was observed in response to cgr_ <dig> mutations. furthermore, growth of mutant strains was examined. in contrast to the situation in c. diphtheriae, where we found an unaltered growth rate and a strongly increased biomass formation caused by lack of dip <dig>  in c. glutamicum r mutation of cgr_ <dig> led to a slightly decreased growth rate and unaltered final optical density of the culture. the exact function of the nlpc/p <dig> protein family members in c. glutamicum was also not unravelled until now.

in respect to adhesion and internalization of c. diphtheriae to epithelial cells, the results obtained in this study suggest that dip <dig> is crucial for localization and function of adhesion and invasion factors and consequently, structural alterations caused by lack dip <dig> prevent adhesion of corresponding mutants to host cells and invasion into these cells.

CONCLUSIONS
c. diphtheriae protein dip <dig> was, as its homologs ce <dig>  cg <dig>  and jk <dig> in corynebacterium efficiens, corynebacterium glutamicum, and corynebacterium jeikeium, previously annotated as hypothetical invasion-associated protein. generation and analyses of mutant strains indicate that dip <dig> is predominantly involved in the organization of the outer surface protein layer of c. diphtheriae rather than in the separation of the peptidoglycan cell wall of dividing bacteria. the adhesion- and invasion-negative phenotype of corresponding mutant strains is an effect of rearrangements of the outer surface of bacteria. specific interaction partners for dip <dig> and its homologs in other corynebacteria are unknown and might be the focus of further studies to unravel the specific functions and targets of these proteins on a molecular level.
