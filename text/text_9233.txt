BACKGROUND
sulfur-containing organic compounds are present as a substantial portion of petroleum, and generally display significant economic and environmental impacts. among these, health issues , corrosion of equipment in refineries, acid rain  <cit> , damage of crops , reduction of the ph of lakes, and increased damage to marine life  <cit>  can be highlighted. because those compounds can be air transported, their impact tends to be also observed at a distance from the sites of production and/or use. however, all these damages can be sharply reduced if sulfur-rich compounds are removed from petroleum and its derivatives before they go through combustion  <cit> . in oil refineries, various hydrodesulfurization processes are usually adopted for sulfur removal  <cit> , although the temperature and pressure management costs are usually very high and the removal process is difficult and largely inefficient  <cit> . in this scenario, biological desulfurization is an important alternative to oil industries, as it takes place under mild conditions of temperature and energy  <cit> . efficient biodesulfurization of sulfur-containing compounds is the most economically and environmentally friendly manner to eliminate this class of important pollutants from the production/consumption chains of fossil fuels.

studies on biodesulfurization have considered dibenzothiophene  as a model compound  <cit> . desulfurization of this molecule is essentially achieved through either reductive or oxidative pathways that release sulfur in the form of sulfate or sulfite  <cit> . a biodesulfurization process known as the ‘4s’ pathway is of particular interest, as it allows the maintenance of a large calorific value of fuels, with less potential for environmental pollution; it was discovered after a series of studies involving the rhodococcus sp. isolate igts <dig>  <cit> . in this pathway, a specific oxidative attack against the thiophenic compound causes removal of the sulfur molecule. briefly, this pathway displays various enzymes with different specific activities  <cit> , which act in the following sequence of steps  <cit> : a monooxygenase  oxidizes dbt into dbt sulfoxide , another converts this compound into dbt sulfone , which is then converted into 2-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate ; as the last step, a desulfinase  withdraws sulfur from the carbon-sulfur bonds, transforming hbps into 2-hydroxybiphenyl  and sulphate. bacteria that use this metabolic pathway can, therefore, remove the highly toxic thiophenic compound in the form of a less aggressive inorganic substance, in a biochemical process that prevents losses of energy value  <cit> . although some authors have added extra energy sources in growth media in an attempt to increase the degradation capability, the use of specialized microorganisms for the biodesulfurization procedure usually does not require media enrichment, such that the test compound  can be used as the sole source of energy for the microbial metabolism  <cit> .

in a previous study, the use of dbt as an energy source was assessed in the growth of bacteria obtained from soil from an oily sludge landfarming in a tropical environment  <cit> ; nine isolates that showed dbt-consuming ability were selected for further research. in the current work, these isolates were compared in their growth behavior in media containing dbt and were identified through sequencing. the isolate labeled as ‘rr3’ showed the best dbt-degrading performance and was further assessed, aiming at verifying its temporal and quantitative ability to not only degrade this compound, but also to produce hbp, one of the final products of the 4s pathway resulting from the dszb enzyme activity. the results indicated this isolate as being closely related to bacillus pumilus and as being capable of a very high and rapid degradation of dbt, likely through more than one type of metabolism.

RESULTS
all the nine isolates under study  showed to be capable of biodesulfurization of oils, as they were able to grow in minimal mineral medium supplemented with dbt as the sole sulfur and carbon source. their molecular identification was carried out by sequencing of the 16 s rrna gene, obtained by pcr amplification and direct amplicon purification from each isolate. as shown in table  <dig>  all strains appeared to belong to the phylum firmicutes, bacilli class and bacillales order. at the genus level, only the -33o isolate was classified as paenibacillus sp , whereas all others appeared to belong to the bacillus genus . further support to the assignment of these isolates to the bacillus genus was given by positive results for the gram test, as well as by cells morphology under light microscopy. seven out of the nine isolates could not be resolved between bacillus safensis and b. pumilus based only on the sequence of this gene . these two closely related species have a phylogenetic relationship that has already been fully described  <cit> .table  <dig>

nevertheless, taking into account other studies on morphological, physiological and pcr amplification aspects of this rr- <dig> isolate  and the other six closely related ones , we strongly suggest these seven isolates belong to the same species, and that they are indeed more closely related to the b. pumilus species. interestingly, with exception of the paenibacillus sp. isolate identified, this appears to be the first report in which isolates/species from the bacillus genus have shown ability to grow on/metabolize dbt . this is somewhat not surprising, as bacillus spp is one of the most studied bacterial genus, showing a great metabolic versatility that provides the opportunity for an array of biotechnological applications  <cit> . adding strength to this possibility, a recent genome sequencing of the b. pumilus s- <dig> strain indicated the presence of various monooxygenases  <cit> , which could help explain at least part of the observed dbt-desulfurization phenotype of rr- <dig>  moreover, such genome characterization also found an array of other metabolical/biochemical capabilities, suggesting ability of this species in using a variety of carbon sources and adapting to various unfavorable conditions  <cit> . however, in our hands, the use of specific pcr amplification for the dszc and dszb genes  resulted in non-specific amplicons . moreover, sequence alignments of dsz genes  for the rhodococcus sp and gordonia alkalivorans bacterial species  against the full genome of b. pumilus  <cit>  have not provided any meaningful result . taken together, these results suggest the rr- <dig> isolate is likely bearing a specific metabolism and/or novel undescribed genes for dbt degradation that has not yet been described .table  <dig>

these results thereby suggest that landfarm soil  may be a rich source of other bacterial species not yet identified or recognized as efficient dbt degraders.

with the objective of verifying the best growth performances in medium containing dibenzothiophene as the sole carbon source , all nine isolates were cultivated in these same conditions. the results indicated that the b. pumilus-related rr- <dig> isolate showed the fastest growth behavior among all, which clearly suggests an intrinsic and special capability of using dbt as an energy source compound. based on this, we opted for pursuing further in-depth characterization only for this isolate, which was considered a representative of the group with the six other very similar b. pumilus-like isolates .

the rr- <dig> isolate was further characterized with regards to not only aspects of its physiology when growing in dbt-containing lb media, but also the formation of hbp, one of the end products in the 4s biodesulfurization pathway  <cit> . firstly, we evaluated the kinetics of growth and dbt consumption in lb culture based on optical densities, assessing these variables in relation to presence of mgso <dig>  and different amounts of inoculum cells . when these cells originated from a pre-inoculum with an od of  <dig>  at 600 nm, the rr- <dig> isolate entered the exponential phase at around 12 h of growth , and the stationary phase between  <dig> and 48 h. a different temporal pattern was noticed when the inoculum had ~3 × more cells: after 24 h of growth, a decline in od values was observed, which went up again only after 120 h, whereas for  <dig> -od treatments , such a second growth stage occurred between  <dig> and 96 h . parallel to this, a high dbt consumption was observed since early stages of growth. considering the initial concentration of 500 μm of dbt in the medium for both inoculum amounts, it was striking that this compound was almost completely consumed  after the first 24 h , for both  <dig> - and  <dig> -od inocula , despite of their distinct growth profiles . from the 48-h time point forward, the very little remaining dbt appeared to be used up, taking longer for that to occur when inoculum was less concentrated . the possibility of dbt being spontaneously degraded in such a fast rate in lb medium under the same conditions of culture can be discarded. experiments with arthrobacter sp. have shown strong evidence for its stability, as it remained unreacted after two weeks in a medium with boiled bacteria  <cit> . this was indeed confirmed experimentally in our case, based on a full recovery of applied dbt  in microbe-free lb medium, after incubation for the same time and culture conditions.figure  <dig>

after more than 72 h of culture , the observed od patterns suggest a diauxy behavior for the rr- <dig> strain, as it seemed to have entered a second growth phase. as observed by li et al.  <cit>  with phenol degradation such a behavior occurs when more than one energy source is, or become available in the medium. although the activation of many genes for certain metabolisms is directly related to cell density   <cit> , the remaining amounts of dbt after 24 h of growth for both inoculum concentrations  did not allow us to verify whether this possibility was occurring with regards to sensing/signaling in relation to dbt. nevertheless, due to the fast consumption of dbt early in culture, it is reasonable to assume that other carbon sources, either directly from the medium itself or as a consequence of culture metabolism, have likely been used for the diauxy behavior to occur. in this case, we cannot rule out the possibility of quorum sensing systems being operational at those later stages in culture, although an exact mechanism cannot be proposed at this time.

the cells of the b. pumilus-like rr- <dig> isolate seemed to adhere to dbt crystals, as observed at 24-h culture . a similar behavior was observed for yeasts  <cit> , which appears to be a strategy to reduce the cell-compound interface to facilitate enzymatic attack, despite some morphological changes that have occurred as a consequence. no cell abnormality was noted in the rr- <dig> isolate when attached to dbt crystals , although this requires further in-depth observations for more conclusive results. nevertheless, this physical attachment of rr- <dig> cells to dbt crystals suggest they can interact directly with this compound, and so, favored its metabolization, which may occur independently of being cultured/incubated in richer or simple media .

addition of very little amounts of an alternative sulfur source  in the medium containing dbt did not lead to any clear modification in the od values for cell mass, considering both inoculum amounts . however, with regards to the dbt remaining in culture, an interesting alteration was observed: whereas  <dig> × more dbt was observed for  <dig> -od inoculum in medium containing mgso <dig>  essentially no dbt was found in the same medium when culture started from the  <dig> -od inoculum . these results are suggesting that a disturbing effect of mgso <dig> in the metabolism of dbt by the rr- <dig> isolate may be observable, depending on the combination of inoculum amount and mgso <dig> concentration. a similar interference on degradation pathways of organic compounds by readily available inorganic sulfur sources have also been reported in other systems  <cit> . at a higher inoculum concentration , no dbt left for consumption was found ; such a condition may not be unexpected, as it depends on the dynamics of dbt degradation, the initial amount of mgso <dig> used, and the culturing time allowed prior to the evaluation. considering the potential use of this b. pumilus-like isolate for either dbt biodesulfurization from fuels, or its removal from the environment in bioremediation processes, our data indicated that inorganic sulfur sources, if present in sufficient amounts, can interfere with these biodesulfurization processes. at this point, we can not state whether such interference is only of an inhibitory nature; further investigation on combining different concentrations of mgso <dig> and inocula, observing these effects in earlier culture times is required to sort this out.

detection of end products of a given pathway is an indication that such metabolism might well be operational. hence, we assessed the presence of 2-hydroxybiphenyl  in the four media under test to verify whether the rr- <dig> bacillus pumilus isolate is able to desulfurize dbt through a pathway related to the ‘4s’. hbp levels ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm were detected for all cultures and throughout all times, although >  <dig>  μm hbp was observed only up to 48 h . however, a detailed analysis of the results did not allow us to recognize any pattern of hbp presence/accumulation that could be associated with the patterns of dbt degradation. for instance, the high levels of dbt remaining in the  <dig> -od + mgso <dig> medium  did not correspond neither to highest nor to lowest hbp levels ; similarly, the highest levels of hbp at  <dig> and 48 h of culture in  <dig> -od medium did not correspond to either high or low levels of remaining dbt . moreover, variation in cell density given by different inocula did not specifically correlate with higher or lower levels of hbp, at least under these experimental conditions.figure  <dig>

by comparing the overall low levels of remaining dbt after only 24 h in culture with the ~ <dig> times higher starting level of dbt in the media , it seems clear that a fast-consumption metabolism is occurring. in this circumstance, it would be reasonable to expect that stoichiometric high levels of hbp would be found in culture from the use of dbt at the beginning of the 4s pathway. however, the relatively low overall levels  of hbp detected and the lack of a pattern for its accumulation in the tested media  suggest that most of the hbp produced may have been somehow consumed or degraded after its synthesis. alternatively, dbt and/or its derivative metabolites might have been used as carbon source in an alternative pathway  <cit> , thereby preventing full operation of the 4s pathway, and so, the production/accumulation of hbp. at least as observed for the culture starting with  <dig> -od inoculum, the rapid dbt consumption and detection of hbp could corroborate previous findings about the action of 4s-pathway enzymes during exponential growth phase  <cit> . although the hbp detection data would also indicate that genes related to this metabolism  should be operational, homologous sequences for these genes were lacking , which suggest the existence of a specific mechanism and genes not yet described for dbt consumption/hbp formation in the b. pumilus-like rr- <dig> isolate. to account for the lack of stoichiometric relationship between dbt and hbp, the existence of another dbt-consumption metabolism that includes the destruction of the molecule ring cannot be discarded . further research involving biochemical/molecular tests and full-genome sequencing is currently underway to address this question in more details.

to our knowledge, the data presented thus far indicated this strain seems to be the fastest and most efficient degrader of dbt already described, at least at such an initial concentration of this compound in the culture media. from a series of recent studies dealing specifically with dbt-degrader microbes , the closest efficiency in this process in relation to rr- <dig> was found for stenotrophomonas sp., which showed 82% consumption of initial dbt, after 48 h in culture; rhodococcus erythropolis consumed all the dbt applied, but it took ~ <dig> × longer to achieve this. considering the same 24-h time in culture for the rr- <dig>  sphingomonas sp showed to degrade only 43% of initial dbt . it is worth mentioning that our working concentration for dbt in the media fell within the range of initial amounts tested in degradation studies by other microorganisms, which varied from  <dig>  –  <dig>  mm  <cit>  up to  <dig>  –  <dig>  mm dbt  <cit> . in a report where the dbt degradation ability of shewanella putrefaciens and rhodococcus erythropolis were studied, normal growth occurred at initial dbt levels of  <dig>  mm, but inhibitory effects were observed at concentrations ≥  <dig>  mm  <cit> .

considering the fast dbt consumption / hpb detection observed during rr- <dig> growth, a further assay involving resting cells of this isolate was performed, aiming at assessing the rate of dbt degradation and possible presence of hbp in the first 10 h of exposure to dbt . it is worth noting that the cells in this assay were collected from a culture in logarithmic phase, with their physiology presumably set at an active metabolic state. the results confirmed a very fast consumption of dbt by this strain, with an astonishing degradation rate of ≥ 95% of initial dbt after only the first hour of incubation, depending on whether mgso <dig> is present or not. again, the presence of this alternative sulfur source delayed the use of dbt by the bacterial cells, leaving ~ <dig> × more of residual dbt in the first hour and inducing its full consumption to take longer than 10 h . this finding adds further strength to the suggested interference of inorganic sulfur onto dbt metabolism by the rr- <dig> strain . it is critical to note that this compound was present as the sole carbon source available for the cells in simple phosphate buffer. as discussed above, dbt is a very stable component, so that one should not expect any decrease in its amount only by incubation in this buffer at such a mild temperature of 30°c and a slow speed of 150-rpm shaking. therefore, such a very rapid disappearance of dbt can only be attributed to a very fast metabolization by the resting cells. since the very low levels of hbp detected at the same time were not stoichiometric compatible to such a large dbt degradation, this, in fact, adds support to the possibility of a concomitant existence of an alternative metabolism for energy production  using dbt as carbon source. further experiments to specifically address this question of more than one dbt-consumption pathways in rr- <dig> isolate are certainly warranted to clarify this issue.figure  <dig>

taking into account that  the cells were harvested when they were growing exponentially, with oxidative enzymes and their genes being expectedly active, for the resting-cells assays,  dbt was readily consumed when present as the single carbon source, and  in nutrient-rich medium , dbt was yet consumed during the first stages of growth in cultures that reached stationary phase and diauxy behavior later than 24 h , it is strongly suggested that dbt consumption  by the b. pumilus-like rr- <dig> strain is metabolically preferential, when considering other carbon sources available. a high adaptation ability of this bacterium to the surrounding conditions provided by the landfarm system is a plausible explanation for this phenomenon. with regards to hbp, it was once again detected in the cell suspension at very low concentrations , with no observable accumulation pattern in relation to dbt consumption . hence, based on the above discussion, hbp is likely being produced as a consequence of dbt metabolism through a 4s-like  pathway, but used up by the resting cells and/or not being synthesized at all, assuming in this case a concomitant dbt consumption by a different energy-production metabolism, as mentioned above. although hbp was found within a small concentration range, a higher oscillating behavior shown in figure  <dig> for hbp presence was observed for the mgso4-containing treatment, likely because there was dbt still left to be metabolized in the medium.

CONCLUSIONS
from this study, we concluded that  landfarm soil from tropical regions provides a rich source of alternative microbes and metabolisms for biodesulfurization processes;  this seems to be the first report of a bacterium from the bacillus genus  as having such a great ability in metabolizing dbt;  this b. pumilus-like rr- <dig> strain showed the greatest degrading potential ever described for other bacterial strains, based on growth kinetics in liquid culture and resting cells assays;  evidence for the preferential use of dbt as carbon source, likely in more than one type of degrading metabolism, was shown by the lack of a pattern or stoichiometric relationship between dbt consumptioin and hbp detection. microorganisms displaying a biodesulfurization pathway in its metabolic framework similar to the ‘4-step’ one have great biotechnological potential for dbt removal in fossil fuels production; they also have environmental significance in bioremediation strategies for polluted areas, through direct dbt consumption/degradation via other types of metabolism. further assessment of other intermediate metabolites known to be produced by other dbt desulfurization pathways in culture are required to shed more light on the biotechnological potential of the bacillus pumilus-like rr- <dig> strain.
