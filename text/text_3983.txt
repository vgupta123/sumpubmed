BACKGROUND
d-xylonate is an attractive platform chemical which can be produced from non-food carbohydrates by microbial conversion. d-xylonate can be used as a complexing agent or chelator, in dispersal of concrete and as a precursor for compounds such as co-polyamides, hydrogels and  <dig> , <dig> -butanetriol . in addition, it has potential as substitute for d-gluconate, which is widely used in pharmaceuticals, food products, solvents, adhesives, dyes, paints and polishes .

d-xylonate is naturally produced by various bacteria, such as gluconobacter, enterococcus, enterobacter and pseudomonas species . these organisms generally use membrane bound d-xylose or d-glucose oxidases for conversion of d-xylose to d-xylonate and high production of this acid has been achieved from pure d-xylose. however, when industrial hydrolysates would be used as substrates, the yield and purity of the product is expected to be compromised. high production of d-xylonate has also been demonstrated in genetically modified prokaryotic and eukaryotic micro-organisms . the advantages of using eukaryotic micro-organisms, such as saccharomyces cerevisiae, are good tolerance to inhibitors present in the hydrolysates and ability to produce acids in low ph. we have previously engineered s. cerevisiae strains for production of d-xylonate by expressing d-xylose dehydrogenases from caulobacter crescentus, trichoderma reesei and pig liver in this yeast  <cit> . the highest production  of d-xylonate with s. cerevisiae was obtained with an industrial, hydrolysate-tolerant strain expressing an nad+-dependent d-xylose dehydrogenase, xylb, from c. crescentus. however, the high production of d-xylonate in s. cerevisiae leads to dramatically decreased cell viability, especially in later stages of the production process  <cit> .

even though s. cerevisiae has good tolerance of weak organic acids, they cause stress. at least four different cellular systems have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of weak acid-induced stress in s. cerevisiae: 1) the general stress response pathway, regulated by transcription factors msn2p/msn4p  <cit> , 2) the pathway specific for moderately lipophilic weak acids, mediated by transcription factor war <dig>  <cit> , 3) the pathway required for adaptation and resistance to the more hydrophilic acids , regulated by haa <dig> , and 4) the rim <dig> pathways, originally identified as being responsible for alkaline ph responses in yeast, but more recently shown to also be involved in responses to propionic acid  <cit> . in addition, the transcription factor pdr <dig> has been shown to play a role in resistance to medium chain fatty acids  <cit> , further emphasizing the complex nature of the weak acid stress response and its regulation in yeast.

no general "weak organic acid response” can be observed, based on the response of s. cerevisiae to diverse weak organic acids with different degrees of lipophilicity  <cit> . only one gene, tpo <dig>  encoding a multidrug resistance transporter was upregulated in response to all organic acids tested in several studies which focused on weak organic acid treatment of yeast . however, acids with similar properties, clearly induced overlapping responses, especially in transcription of genes related to cell wall metabolism , and genes encoding proteins associated with trans-membrane transport  <cit> .

here we present a transcriptional analysis of d-xylonate production by an industrial, hydrolysate tolerant s. cerevisiae
 <cit>  at different stages of the production process, in order to understand the physiological responses associated with d-xylonate production in s. cerevisiae and especially to uncover mechanisms leading to the loss of viability. these results are considered within the broader context of other published studies which have determined transcriptional responses of s. cerevisiae to weak acid stress, either from externally added, or, as with d-xylonate, from production of weak organic acids.

RESULTS
d-xylonate was produced by the industrial, hydrolysate tolerant s. cerevisiae strain b <dig>  expressing the xylb gene from c. crescentus
 <cit> . the d-glucose consumption rate and the corresponding ethanol production rate were similar for the d-xylonate producing and the control strains, but ethanol consumption was slower for the d-xylonate producing strain . production of xylitol was comparable in the two strains, resulting from intrinsic d-xylose reductase activity, such as the aldose reductase, gre <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
physiological data from bioreactor cultivations. a) extracellular concentrations of d-glucose, d-xylose, xylitol and ethanol. at 47 hours, 4 g/l d-glucose and 25 g/l d-xylose were added to the cultures. one insert shows the first 8 hours of cultivation, and another the hours after addition of d-glucose and d-xylose at 47 h. b) extracellular and intracellular concentrations of d-xylonate. c) biomass and cell viability. arrows indicate the times when samples for microarrays were taken. the experiments were performed in triplicate; average ± standard deviation is shown.



already at 7 hours, d-xylonate had accumulated considerably inside the xylb-expressing cells, to levels corresponding to about 10% of their dry biomass  <cit> . the concentration of d-xylonate continued to increase inside the cells until 47 hours . only small amounts  of d-xylonate were observed in the culture supernatant at 7 hours, but the concentration increased continually until the end of the experiment at 120 hours. a decrease in cell viability of the xylb-expressing strain was detected at 47 hours and viability progressively decreased throughout the production process . by 120 hours, 84 ± 16% of the d-xylonate producing cells were dead. in contrast, the control strain retained its viability throughout the experiment .

transcriptional profiling of the xylb-expressing, d-xylonate producing strain and the control strain focused on times of key physiological changes for the production strain . samples were taken immediately after inoculation ; after d-glucose had been consumed, but with ethanol present, with measurable intracellular d-xylonate and very low extracellular d-xylonate , capturing early responses to d-xylonate production; and after ethanol had been consumed  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  g/l extracellular d-xylonate being present, but viability remaining high , capturing intermediate responses. samples at  <dig> h, after the d-xylonate producing strain had consumed the initial d-xylose, but before addition of more d-glucose and d-xylose, provided data for conditions with the highest intracellular d-xylonate concentration and measureable but low loss of viability in the production strain. the effect of addition of d-glucose, to provide energy and potentially improve d-xylonate export, was assessed at  <dig> h,  <dig> h after the addition when the d-glucose had already been consumed. the late phase of the production process and the stress responses associated with it were assessed with the  <dig> h sample, after significant loss of viability in the d-xylonate producing strain, but with still  <dig> ± 5% of the cells alive.

transcriptome analysis of d-xylonate producing cells and observations from gene clustering
the microarray data quality was confirmed by standard quality control methods  and the data was normalized using the rma method. two clustering approaches were used to visualize gene groups that had distinct transcriptional profiles. both clustering methods used fuzzy c-means clustering  <cit> . the first approach highlighted the differences between the two strains and was based on fold changes  of gene expression between the d-xylonate producing and the control strain with time. the second clustering approach was used to analyse the expression profiles with time, for each strain separately. in this second approach normalized profiles  were used as input to the clustering algorithm to emphasize the “shape” of the expression profiles with time and to capture subtle differences in the up- or down-regulation of each gene, since these are not observed when absolute values or fold-change expression profiles are assessed.

clustering resulted in  <dig> distinct np clusters  and  <dig> distinct fc clusters . the most relevant set of clusters are shown in figure  <dig>  in order to identify genes showing expression changes dependent on d-xylonate production, our analysis focused on clusters with expression profiles consistent with the parameters observed during production of d-xylonate, such as the gradual accumulation of d-xylonate, dissimilar utilization of ethanol, and loss of viability. therefore, we selected clusters which contained genes with either steady up- or down-regulation during d-xylonate production and did not carry out a detailed investigation of clusters with small or insignificant differences or with transient expression changes between the production and the control strains. less emphasis was given to the sample at 49 hours, since the expression profiles of a vast number of genes were apparently influenced by the major physiological impact of d-glucose addition two hours earlier, which was not the focus of this study. gene expression of many genes for the two strains did differ dramatically at this time, so many clusters contain genes with changed expression at this time only, but did not appear to be directly linked to the d-xylonate production.figure  <dig> 
expression profiles of genes showing interesting differences between the strains. a, b) clusters containing genes that showed higher relative expression in the d-xylonate producing strain compared to the control strain: a) clusters np <dig>  np <dig> and np <dig> identified in the normalized profiles clustering analysis, and b) corresponding clusters fc <dig>  fc <dig> and fc <dig> from the fold-change clustering analysis. c) clusters np <dig> and np <dig> from the normalized profile clustering, containing genes with delayed response  in the d-xylonate producing strain. d, e) clusters containing genes showing relatively lower expression in the d-xylonate producing strain; d) clusters fc <dig> and fc <dig> from the fold change clustering, and e) corresponding clusters np <dig> and np <dig> from the normalized profile clustering showing the relativity of the apparent down-regulation seen in clusters fc <dig> and fc <dig>  the numbers of genes shared between np and fc clusters are listed in additional file  <dig> 



results from fc  and np  clustering methods were compared to determine how many genes each np cluster had in common with each fc cluster  and how genes were distributed in the individual clusters by each method. genes which were observed in one np cluster were usually present in one or two fc clusters. on the other hand, genes in one fc cluster were found in several np clusters, since the observed change in fc can be achieved in several ways. for example, cluster fc <dig>  contains genes that were increasingly upregulated during d-xylonate production. in np clustering these genes belong mainly to clusters np <dig>  and np <dig>  that have different profiles compared to each other. some genes in fc <dig> also fall into clusters np <dig> and np <dig> , in which the shapes of the expression profiles in the two cultivations are similar, but the expression level is higher during d-xylonate production compared to the control . detailed information about the clustering is given in additional file  <dig>  in which the cluster memberships of all genes are listed together with the expression profiles  used as the input to the clusterings.

groups of genes with increased expression during d-xylonate production
clusters np <dig>  np <dig>  and np <dig> contain genes whose expression were either increased or not downregulated with time in the d-xylonate producing strain, i.e. as d-xylonate accumulated in the culture . fc <dig>  fc <dig>  and fc <dig> clusters contain the genes with relatively higher expression in the d-xylonate producing strain than in the control . in these six clusters, there were a significant proportion of genes encoding proteins involved in processes related to metabolism of proteins such as translation, rna metabolism, ribosomal structure, and protein degradation. enrichment analysis of the clusters verified this conclusion: gene ontology  categories related to protein biosynthesis were significantly enriched in these clusters. for example, go: <dig>  was enriched with p-value =  <dig> e- <dig> in cluster fc <dig> and go: <dig>  was enriched with p-value  <dig> e- <dig> in cluster fc <dig>  visualisation of the log <dig> ratio profiles  of all genes encoding ribosomal proteins illustrates the higher expression of translation machinery during d-xylonate production compared to the absence of production .figure  <dig>

clusters np <dig>  np <dig>  np <dig>  fc <dig>  fc <dig> and fc <dig>  with genes that either had increased expression or were not down-regulated, contained haa <dig> , tpo <dig> , pma <dig> , pdr <dig> , pdr <dig> , ssa <dig>  and genes encoding components of vacuolar membrane proton pumps, such as vma <dig>  tfp <dig>  vph <dig>  and vps <dig>  haa <dig> and tpo <dig>  encoding a transcription factor and a drug:h+ antiporter, respectively, play an important role in acetic and propionic acid tolerance  <cit> . pma <dig> encodes a plasma membrane proton pump from the abc-family that plays an essential role in ph homeostasis  <cit> . pdr <dig> and pdr <dig> also encode multidrug transporters and are involved in responses to stresses induced by various organic acids . ssa <dig> is induced by sorbate stress  <cit> . hsp <dig> encodes a plasma membrane protein induced by multiple stresses, including weak organic acids  <cit> . the vacuolar membrane proton pumps are also crucial for intracellular ph regulation. these genes have previously been reported to be significantly up-regulated during weak acid stress .

a significant portion of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, the cell wall integrity  pathway, and protein glycosylation were also present in these clusters. almost all genes regulated by the pkc-slt <dig> map-kinase  pathway, as identified by jung and levin  <cit> , were members of these clusters. sixteen out of  <dig> genes positively regulated by the cwi pathway were significantly more expressed, and two out of five genes negatively regulated by the cwi pathway were significantly less expressed during d-xylonate production than in the control strain, especially in the later stages of cultivation .figure  <dig>

delayed response in d-xylonate producing strain at 23 h
clusters np <dig> and np <dig> figure 2c) showed differences in the responses of the two strains at 23 h and 49 h. many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes  were present in cluster np <dig> , and many tca cycle and related genes  were in cluster np <dig> . the transcription profile of cluster np <dig> indicated that the glycolytic genes were already down-regulated in the control strain at 23 hours , which corresponded to the absence of d-glucose at this time. these genes were still relatively highly expressed in the d-xylonate-producing strain at 23 h, even though d-glucose had been consumed at a similar rate as by the control strain . a similar trend was seen at 49 h, when the glycolytic genes were down-regulated in the control strain, in comparison to the d-xylonate-producing strain . the transcription profiles in cluster np <dig> showed a similar shift in the timing of expression responses of other metabolic genes. in np <dig>  the level of transcription of genes encoding enzymes of the tca cycle and processes related to post-diauxic shift  were significantly overrepresented. while in the control strain, the genes of tca cycle had already been down-regulated at 23 hours and up-regulated at 49 hours, in the d-xylonate-producing strain these genes were actively transcribed at 23 hours, but not yet up-regulated at 49 hours .

groups of genes with lower expression during d-xylonate production than in the control
genes with lower relative expression levels in the d-xylonate producing strain than in the control were pooled in clusters fc <dig> and fc <dig> . cluster fc <dig> only contained  <dig> genes and interestingly included the genes pdr <dig>  encoding a multidrug abc transporter regulated by pdr <dig>  <cit> , and pma <dig>  encoding an isoform of the plasma membrane h+-atpase pma1p. a large percent  of genes in cluster fc <dig> encoded proteins involved in the transport of various molecules, both through intracellular membranes and through the plasma membrane. in addition, cluster fc <dig> contained genes involved in autophagy and negative regulation of the pka pathway ; go: <dig>  autophagy, was enriched with p-value  <dig> . comparison of this cluster with the corresponding np clusters  revealed that many of the genes were in fact upregulated in both strains between  <dig> and  <dig> hours, but that their expression was either delayed or significantly lower in the d-xylonate-producing strain .

validation of micro-array data
expression analysis of selected genes during batch growth in flasks
the results of the transcriptomics analysis were validated by analysing the expression of some genes which had shown dominant differences in the microarray analysis in batch flask cultures that corresponded to the first phase of the bioreactor cultures , but lacked ph control. the accumulation of biomass was almost identical in the d-xylonate producing strain and the control strain, but consumption of d-glucose was slightly slower in the d-xylonate producing strain. ethanol utilisation was slower in flasks than in the bioreactor, reflecting poorer aeration in the flasks, but the production strain again consumed ethanol more slowly than the control. after an initial ph decrease in both cultures, the ph increased in the control cultures, but continued to decrease in cultures of the production strain, as d-xylonate accumulated .

the expression profiles of genes analysed by pcr from flask cultures were similar to those observed with array analysis from the bioreactors . higher expression of translation-related genes during d-xylonate production was shown with rpp1b and rps0b. the cell wall integrity pathway activation was represented by pst <dig> and ccw <dig>  and elevated acid stress associated responses were represented by tpo <dig> and pma <dig> figure  <dig> 
comparison of qpcr and microarray analyses of selected genes. expression profiles of translation-related genes , genes controlled by the cell wall integrity pathway , and acid stress-associated genes . the comparison of the two methods shows strong similarity of the profiles from corresponding conditions. the apparently different patterns for the rpp1b, rps0b, and pma <dig> genes are caused by a strong upregulation of these genes in presence of d-glucose, which is captured in the qpcr “0 h” time-point, but not in the microarray “0 h” time-point. recalculated profiles, considering only the conditions without d-glucose, show significant similarity for the profiles of these genes also . the shown values represent the average of two  and three  independent cultivations.



dynamics of the cwi pathway in response to d-xylonate production
the response of the cell wall integrity pathway to the later phase of d-xylonate production was assessed by analysing the phosphorylation of the map kinase slt <dig>  which was increasingly more strongly phosphorylated in the xylb expressing strain than in the control after 16 hours of d-xylonate production . this correlated with the transcription profiles of genes which are under control of the cwi pathway. slt <dig> is activated upon phosphorylation and in turn phosphorylates transcription factor rlm <dig> which is the key activator of the cwi pathway genes  <cit>  . in both the control and the d-xylonate producing strain, slt <dig> was transiently phosphorylated during the diauxic shift.

possible role of d-xylonate accumulation in deregulation of the pka pathway
intracellular concentrations of camp did not differ between the control and the production strain . however, the levels of trehalose and glycogen in the strains differed considerably . the lowest level of trehalose in both strains was observed during early logarithmic growth, at 2 hours. after this, the level increased and then decreased in both strains, but was markedly lower in the d-xylonate producing than in the control strain from  <dig> to 36 h. glycogen levels were comparable in the two strains during the first 6 hours of the cultivation, after which more glycogen was observed in the d-xylonate producing strain than in the control between  <dig> and 24 hours, but less after 36 h .

comparison to published acid production and acid stress transcriptomic data
transcriptomic data obtained in this study were compared to transcriptomic data from published acid production and acid stress experiments in s. cerevisiae . the combined data-set had  <dig> comparisons, including three from this study . a subset of  <dig> genes that were reported to be significant in at least two of the comparisons was selected. the resulting gene expression data matrix was clustered using hierarchical clustering and visualized as a heatmap . no general weak acid response was observed in all experiments, i.e. different weak acids induce different transcriptional responses. however, common responses at the level of individual genes were observed for some of the acids. in addition, the experimental setup was found to have a strong impact on the responses; experiments with the same acid in different publications did not group together. in cases with similar experimental setups, the responses were mostly similar . on the other hand, genes with common biological functions responded similarly to different acids: the go categories enriched  in the selected list of acid-responding genes were transmembrane transport , lipid metabolism , translation , amino acid metabolism , cell wall organization , iron ion homeostasis  and cell adhesion .table  <dig> 
list of publications and brief description of the conditions they included, used in the comparison of transcriptional responses shown in figure

comparison of transcriptional responses in different weak acid stress and acid production conditions. previously published microarray data on weak acid tolerance and acid production  were combined, normalized together, and clustered. this heat map includes genes that were reported to be significant in at least two of the comparisons. cell wall integrity pathway genes  are indicated in blue in the lists of genes. gene names are provided in a bigger font, group by group, in the same order as they appear in the rows of the heat map. the coloured bar above the columns of the heat map  indicates samples which involved the same acid. column descriptions can be found in table  <dig>  where they are listed in the order that they appear in this clustering .



the overall transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae during d-xylonate production was different from that in any other acid production or acid stress experiment . some similarity was, however, observed between responses to d-xylonate and artemisinic acid production, in which the pattern of translation-related genes expression was shared.

comparison to published general stress data
the transcriptome data obtained from bioreactor cultures in this study were also compared to data from yeast general stress response studies  <cit> . the combined data-set had  <dig> comparisons, including ten from this study . a subset of  <dig> genes was selected: the environmental stress response  genes identified in the gasch et al. study  <cit> , genes that responded at least three fold in at least  <dig> of the experiments in causton et al.  <cit>  and finally, genes that were significantly differentially expressed in the d-xylonate producing strain at 23 h compared to 0 h or at 47 h compared to 0 h. the resulting gene expression data matrix was clustered using hierarchical clustering and visualized as a heatmap .

a typical environmental stress response  was seen in most stress experiments , with the interesting exceptions of hypo-osmotic shock and mild cold stress, which had opposite responses to other stresses . d-xylonate production did not cause a typical esr, but three comparisons from this study, 7 h vs. 0 h in both strains and 49 h vs. 0 h in the d-xylonate producing strain, showed similarities in the overall gene expression pattern with hypo-osmotic shock  and mild cold stress. some of the other comparisons from this study showed some similarities with conditions tested by gasch  <cit>  and causton  <cit>  that had less distinct esr responses. most of the comparisons from this study from later times in the cultivations  vs. 0 h clustered together and were generally similar in terms of their global expression pattern. the only exception was the 23 h vs. 0 h comparison for the d-xylonate producing strain, in which the rap <dig> target genes  <cit>  were not down-regulated or were even up-regulated. in general, the later times vs. 0 h comparisons showed down-regulation of most of the genes that are typically downregulated in general  stress, except for the rap <dig> target genes, which were not down-regulated in any d-xylonate comparisons. in contrast, only a fraction of the typically upregulated esr genes were also upregulated during the cultivations performed in this study.

discussion
production of more than 20 g/l d-xylonate is a challenge to s. cerevisiae in terms of intracellular acid accumulation and viability  <cit> , which could limit the development of industrially relevant processes with high d-xylonate production. in order to understand how cells respond to producing d-xylonate, we analysed the transcriptome of this strain during d-xylonate production. transcriptional profiling revealed that only some of the genes previously identified as involved in a weak acid stress response were differentially expressed in the d-xylonate producing strain, in comparison to the control strain. in addition, genes involved in the cell wall integrity pathway, translational machinery and protein catabolism were significantly more expressed. however, some of the genes encoding proteins involved in transmembrane transport and autophagy were down-regulated. d-xylonate production did not cause a typical environmental stress response , either. although production of d-xylonate led to unexpected expression of many genes which are part of the esr, the expression profile differed from previously described responses to various stresses.

the integrated analyses of transcriptomic data which had originated from different publications and/or from different microarray platforms provided clear evidence that acid induced stress differs from the general esr and is much more diverse. comparison of such diverse data required normalisation, to ensure that all data was compared on the same basis, and selection of an appropriate subset of genes . although only a subset of genes was used for the integrated microarray data visualizations , the selection of genes did not change the main conclusion that producing d-xylonate is not very similar to other stress conditions, including stress from other weak acids or production of other acids.

the generally unique transcriptional response during d-xylonate production, relative to transcriptional responses to other weak acids or acid production, was in accordance with previous studies which have shown that the chemical structure of the weak acid strongly affects transcriptional responses  <cit> . our integrative data analysis also showed that responses towards even the same acids may be different when the culture conditions and strain backgrounds are different. even though different individual genes respond to different weak acids, they do share the same biological functions: protein folding, lipid metabolism, cell wall function, and multidrug resistance  <cit> . in addition to these, our analysis showed that there are also changes in transmembrane transport, amino acid metabolism, iron ion homeostasis, and cell adhesion. during d-xylonate production, we observed changes in the transcription of individual genes in all these categories, but only in the case of cell wall function and transmembrane transport was a large group of genes involved.

the cell wall integrity  pathway was activated during the later stages of d-xylonate production, as seen both in the transcription of nearly all cwi-regulated genes , and in the phosphorylation of slt <dig> kinase. normally, the cwi pathway is activated in conditions which cause stress or directly damage the cell wall  <cit> 
. the cwi pathway is also regulated during morphological changes, in a cell cycle dependent manner, and by mating pheromone  <cit> . slt <dig> phosphorylation has previously been shown to be activated by low ph caused by addition of hcl and by acetic acid stress  <cit> . the activation of this pathway during d-xylonate production thus indicates that cells producing d-xylonate experience stress on their cell walls, either directly from the d-xylonate or indirectly as a consequence of other cellular stress caused by its production. the nature of damage to the cell wall caused by low ph or weak acid stress is not known. since cell wall related genes have also been observed to be up-regulated under other weak acid stress conditions, it may be inferred that reinforcement of the cell wall is a general response to weak acids  <cit>  .

translation-related genes are usually repressed under environmental stresses such as nutrient depletion, heat shock and osmotic shock  <cit> . for example, translation-related genes are already repressed at the time of d-glucose depletion, before the diauxic shift  <cit> . however, the d-xylonate producing strain had higher expression levels of these genes than the control strain, even though the cells were apparently under such severe stress that cell viability was reduced. down-regulation of the major translation-related genes did occur in both production and control cultures as a result of d-glucose depletion, but to a lesser extent in the d-xylonate producing strain, so that subsequently it had higher relative expression of these genes . this, together with an increase in the abundance of genes encoding proteins involved in proteolysis, indicated that there was increased protein turn-over in the d-xylonate-producing strain compared to the control, especially in the later stages of the cultivation. a similar response in transcription of translation-related genes has been observed in cells producing artemisinic acid  <cit> . the viability of the cells during artemisinic acid production was not reported, but plasmid stability was shown to be very low, which may indicate that the artemisinic acid production also caused stress to the cells. however, apart from the translation-related genes, the transcriptional responses caused by the production of d-xylonic acid and artemisinic acid were not similar.

upon nutrient limitation, yeast cells normally enter stationary phase, during which they are more resistant to environmental stress. the process of entry to the stationary phase is not fully understood, but the transcriptional changes involved happen already before and during the diauxic shift  <cit> . then synthesis of trehalose and glycogen are activated via a mechanism involving the protein kinases rim <dig> and pka  <cit> . while glycogen is thought to be primarily a storage carbohydrate, the level of trehalose is associated with stress resistance. the level of both of these carbohydrates was considerably different in the d-xylonate-producing strain than in the control. we also observed significantly lower expression of genes involved in autophagy, the process cells use for recycling of proteins and cellular organelles and which is required for survival during nutrient limitation , in the d-xylonate producing strains than in the control. there was a pattern of increased budding in the later stage of d-xylonate production . these observations  in combination with the loss in viability during d-xylonate production indicated that cells producing d-xylonate were unable to adapt normally to stationary phase. in this respect d-xylonate producing cells resemble cells with constitutive pka pathway activation, which do not adapt to stationary phase upon nutrient deprivation, show low level of storage carbohydrates, are highly sensitive to heat shock and grow poorly on non-fermentable and weakly fermentable carbon sources  <cit> .

the pka pathway is one of the major regulators of the cell cycle and of general stress responses  <cit> , but d-xylonate producing cells appear to have an activated pka pathway during stationary phase, when they should not. acidification of the cytosol, which has been observed in d-xylonate producing cells  <cit> , may lead to accumulation of camp and activation of the pka pathway  <cit> , although measurable increase in camp levels was not observed in d-xylonate producing cells. none-the-less, some of the negative regulators of the pka pathway  were less expressed in the production than in the control strain, and the lack of down-regulation of rap <dig> targets  <cit>   may also reflect pka activation. thus, the transcriptional analysis, along with the physiological data, showed that activation of the pka pathway may play an important role during later stages of d-xylonate production by s. cerevisiae, while the inability to adapt to stationary phase may contribute to the observed loss of viability of the production strain.

CONCLUSIONS
weak organic acids have pleiotropic effects on the physiology of s. cerevisiae. in contrast to the common transcriptional response to most environmental stresses, this and previous studies of transcriptomic responses in s. cerevisiae to the presence or production of various organic acids have shown that there is no general transcriptional response to all organic acids, but rather both the structure of the acid and the experimental conditions determine the response. the transcriptional response to d-xylonate production was unique, differing from both general stress responses and from responses induced by other organic acids.

production of d-xylonic acid leads to intracellular accumulation of the acid and dramatically decreased viability  <cit> . d-xylonate production apparently imposed considerable stress on the cell wall. however, there was also evidence that increased protein turnover, imbalance in ph homeostasis, and activation of the pka pathway occurred during d-xylonate production, leaving cells unable to adapt normally to stationary phase. this, together with intracellular acidification, probably contributed to cell death.
