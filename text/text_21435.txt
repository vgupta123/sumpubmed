BACKGROUND
determining the location of the active site of an enzyme is a crucial step in fundamental research as well as in drug design. in genetical studies, identifying mutations at or near an active site can help explain biological malfunctions. knowledge of an active site, its geometry and physico-chemical properties, is essential for the efficient design of inhibitors of malignant proteins  <cit> . with extensive data now at hand on sequence and structure of genes and proteins, and broad functional knowledge, new methods aimed at determining the sequence and space location of unknown active sites from related or distant data have been elaborated over recent years. on specific protein families, such as dna-binding proteins, methods analysing sequence only  <cit>  or structural patterns  <cit>  have proved efficient at detecting functional sites of such proteins. for more general applications, the distributions of different structural properties only  <cit>  or in combination with physico-chemical properties of residues  <cit>  have been studied. these properties were e.g. integrated into a neural network algorithm, in order to predict active site residues over various proteins with known structures  <cit> . a similar approach was used by petrova, so as to predict active sites using support vector machine on different structural and conservation properties of protein residues  <cit> . another method, the 'evolutionary trace', relies on the hypothesis that important residues show slower mutation rates than non-functional residues in proteins and that, in three-dimensional structures, such residues are more likely to be clustered with each others than to be isolated in space  <cit> . graph-derived approaches that detect the structural patterns of side-chain atoms that are recurrent over evolutionarily-related proteins were also proven to efficiently detect protein functional sites  <cit> . an optimal division of protein families into subfamilies, which followed the principles of phylogeny, enabled the identification of residues that were important for protein function  <cit> . lastly, representation of protein structures as networks of interacting residues also enabled efficient detection of protein functional sites from three-dimensional structures  <cit> .

this last representation, which facilitates mathematical manipulations of protein structures, is used in the current work. in such networks, each protein residue is a node, and two residues are connected by an edge if they have atoms within a given distance from each other. in the original definition, only contacts between amino-acids cα atoms were considered  <cit> . this description proved relevant for the detection of secondary structure motifs  <cit>  and for comparing protein structures  <cit> .

closeness centrality of a node  within a network , as used in recent studies for the detection of protein catalytic sites  <cit> , takes into account pathways that connect residues over the whole protein. our belief was that interactions that take place at a local scale between residues would have a greater influence on the chemical and physical properties of residues than global properties. non-bonding interactions have indeed very little chemical effect in the long range, as being due to electrostatic effects  <cit> . in addition, the modification of the electron richness of the side-chain atoms of a residue is in most cases not modified by residues that are distant from it by more than two non-covalent contacts.

the main features we thus focused on to describe protein residues were the number of 'local' neighbours of a node, i.e. nodes that are distant from this node by a path-length of one or two edges within the residue network. it has been shown that 2-connectivity, the count of the number of nodes distant by at most two edges from a given node, produced a similar efficacy at detecting protein active sites as closeness centrality  <cit> . here we describe a combination of the counts of local neighbours, based both on all-atom contacts and side-chain atoms only contacts, with the distribution of residue types among protein catalytic sites. this score was tested for classifying residues as catalytic and non-catalytic using a set of over  <dig> proteins. detection of catalytic sites was evaluated with respect to precision, or predictive value of positives, which reached a value superior to 28%. this performance is more than triple that of closeness centrality  <cit> . our score also had highly improved performance using a measure that combined precision and coverage. lastly, it was tested in detail over a set of eight proteins with different biological functions. results suggested that our score was not only efficient at detecting only 'catalytic' residues, as defined in the catalytic site atlas  <cit>  but, more broadly, at detecting any residue involved in protein function.

RESULTS
detection of functional sites: general approach
residue interaction networks were generated after the three-dimensional structures of a large test set of  <dig> proteins. each of these proteins belonged to a distinct scop superfamily  and had identified catalytic site residues, as being reported in the catalytic site atlas  <cit> . this atlas considers as catalytic the residues of a protein that are involved in catalytic reactions, under the following rules: being one of the reactant of the catalytic reaction, exerting an effect on a residue, a water molecule, a ligand or a cofactor which assists catalysis, stabilisation of a proposed transition state  <cit> .

for each residue interaction network, different network parameters were analysed. individual scores were next transformed into mdev values . mdev values do not involve standard deviations, and quantify deviations from average towards maximum for a given parameter .

as a benchmark to our method, prediction of protein catalytic sites was performed after the criteria defined by amitai and pietrokovski  <cit> . these criteria combine z-score values on closeness centrality  <cit>  and ranges for residue surface accessibility  values  <cit> . using our set of  <dig> proteins, these criteria yielded a precision  of  <dig> % for the detection of catalytic sites .

calculations were run over the residue interaction networks derived from the  <dig> protein structures from our extended test set. scoring functions used here are described in methods. values for precision and coverage were obtained over the whole set. f <dig> and f <dig> respectively represent the f-measure defined in methods when using β =  <dig> and β =  <dig>  a as proposed by amitai  <cit> . rsa: residue surface accessibility. bresidues were considered as catalytic if their mdev value for the scoring function defined in equation  <dig> was superior to the indicated threshold value. corresponding 'specificity' /r-) values were  <dig> % at mdev <dig>   <dig> % at mdev <dig>  and  <dig> % when using closeness combined to rsa.

detection of catalytic sites: performance of our scoring function
our scoring function combined three characteristics of a given residue: the number of residues in contact with it through side-chain atoms , the number of residues located at a path-length of three  and the type of the residue . it was used to detect catalytic residues over a set of  <dig> proteins belonging to different structural families. the score obtained for each residue was then transformed into a normalised mdev value. moreover, the threshold value of mdev was optimized in order to produce a maximal value for a measure of performance that combined the precision and coverage values of the detection. indeed, in order to have an efficient tool for the prediction of residues interesting for site-directed mutagenesis, it is important both to predict few non-catalytic residues  and to have a high likelihood that a catalytic site is effectively predicted as such . still, precision tends to increase with increasing values of thresholds, while coverage displays an opposite trend. we thus optimised our detection of catalytic sites for a maximal value of a measure of performance which combined precision and coverage, the f-measure  <cit> :

 fβ=×β2×coverage +precision. 

this measure of effectiveness was maximised for the extended set of  <dig> proteins in two conditions: at β =  <dig>  i.e. when precision and coverage were given a similar importance, and at β =  <dig>  with increased importance on precision. the maximum values for f <dig> and f <dig> when using our scoring function were respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> %, with corresponding threshold values of mdev <dig> =  <dig>  and mdev <dig> =  <dig>  . the corresponding values for precision and coverage are displayed in table  <dig> 

when comparing these values with those obtained using closeness centrality and rsa, our scoring function produced a two-fold increase in precision when using mdev <dig> and more than three-fold increase in the mdev <dig>  with calculations performed on the same data set . moreover, the overall performance was improved with respect to that same method, both when using f <dig> at threshold mdev <dig> and f <dig> at threshold mdev <dig> .

distributions of per-protein performance values were homogeneous at threshold mdev <dig>  while precision values were split between low and high values at mdev <dig> . the average of the per-protein coverage was  <dig> % when considering as catalytic the residues with an mdev value superior to mdev <dig>  with  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins having a coverage value above 40%. when using threshold mdev <dig>  the average of the per-protein precision was  <dig> %, with a quarter of the  <dig> proteins having a precision greater than 80% .

validation set: detailed performance and re-consideration of 'catalytic' residues
in order to evaluate the quality of our detection method at a structural and functional level, eight proteins belonging to different functional families were analysed into more detail. these proteins along with their catalytic sites and the residues predicted as catalytic by our scoring function are presented in table  <dig> 

a all residues predicted using our scoring parameter at threshold mdev <dig>  in bold, those also predicted at threshold mdev <dig>  with * superscript, residues that are 'catalytic' according to csa definition. residues that are 'functional' according to our definition  but not 'catalytic' according to csa are underlined. bderived from the analysis of multiple crystallized states. see text for references.

for this smaller set we considered 'catalytic' residues as well as 'functional' ones based on extensive analysis of existing literature on each of these proteins. 'functional' residues, as opposed to the more restrictive definition of 'catalytic' residues of the csa, included all residues which had a proven role either in the binding of substrate or cofactor, as well as in the catalytic activity of the protein, even though not directly involved in the catalytic reaction.

detection of 'catalytic' residues was run on the two threshold values which yielded maximal values for f <dig> and f <dig>  mdev <dig> and mdev <dig> respectively, with results summarized in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  as the second criterion is more restrictive than the first one, all residues predicted as positives using the second threshold were also predicted as positives using the first one.

calculations were run on the  <dig> protein structures of the validation set. our scoring function  was used, with detection at two different thresholds. residues were considered as positives  if their mdev value was superior to the threshold value. performances are expressed with respect to the whole set. avalues correspond to measure f <dig> for mdev <dig> and f <dig> for mdev <dig> 

tem β-lactamase is responsible for bacterial resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins antibiotics. for this protein, catalytic ser <dig> was not detected, while the two residues which are likely to play the role of a base for the activation of this serine, lys <dig> and glu <dig>  <cit> , were detected . asp <dig> is strictly conserved over known class a β-lactamases  <cit> .

in pancreatic phospholipase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of phospholipids, catalytic asp <dig> was detected, but only at mdev <dig>  active-site his <dig>  calcium-binding asp <dig> and substrate-binding arg <dig>  <cit>  were also detected.

alkylguanine transferase is a key enzyme in dna repair which catalyses the dealkylation of o <dig> from guanine nucleotides. prediction on this enzyme yielded numerous positive residues, among which catalytic cys <dig> was not present. still, the two residues proposed as activating this residue by deprotonation, his <dig> and glu <dig>  <cit> , were predicted as catalytic. all but two of the remaining residues predicted as catalytic had either a structural role in the arrangement of the active site  or a functional role   <cit> .

for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  <dig>  an enzyme involved in the transfer of ubiquitin entities to protein substrates, none of the three residues predicted as catalytic possessed a described role in enzyme activity  <cit> . still, these residues defined a single pocket in the crystal structure, which is located at the surface of the protein, and facing the second monomer present in the structure . these residues could thus play a role in interactions of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with other proteins.

phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the aromatic-ring hydroxylation of amino-acid phenylalanine to produce tyrosine. three of the ligands of the active-site iron of this enzyme were detected , while the last detected residue  is hydrogen-bonded to an iron-binding water molecule  <cit>  . it is interesting to note that, in spite of the length of the protein sequence , all residues detected play a functional role. a distribution of the mdev values for our scoring function on each residue of this protein is shown in figure  <dig> 

prolyl-isomerase  <dig> catalyses the cis-trans isomerisation of proline residues, and recent studies have linked this protein to cancer and alzheimer's disease  <cit> . his <dig> and his <dig>  are catalytic residues that are located at the bottom of the pocket for substrate interaction , while glu <dig> is located in the region that links the isomerase domain to the ww domain of the protein  <cit> .

in the fe3+-binding protein, a protein involved in bacterial iron uptake, one residue detected at mdev <dig> is an iron ligand , and the second one  interacts with substrate phosphate and is located close to iron . among the four additional residues predicted at mdev <dig> , one is an iron ligand  and one  hydrogen binds both arg <dig> and a water molecule close to the active-site iron.

none of the residue predicted by our method in protease bovine β-trypsin is involved in catalytic function . still, as observed in more recent inhibitor-bound structure  <cit> , four of the six residues predicted as catalytic are directly hydrogen-bonded to inhibitor molecule , or to water molecules that are present at the active site. moreover, while asp <dig>  which was detected at mdev <dig>  is not involved in docking, its two sequence neighbours, gly <dig> and ser <dig>  directly interact with bound inhibitor and are labelled as catalytic residues in the pdb structure.

overall, for six out of the eight proteins, catalytic residues were detected using our scoring function, though with many positive residues that were not catalytic according to csa definition . still, for all but one of the proteins, all residues predicted at mdev <dig> corresponded to 'functional' residues. we labelled as such the residues directly involved in catalytic reactions or in substrate binding, as well as those located near an active site that had a proven influence on catalytic rate, as deduced from experimental results. when using either mdev <dig> or mdev <dig> threshold value, the precisions obtained were higher than those obtained on the extended set . coverage values of catalytic residues were respectively of  <dig> % and  <dig> % at mdev <dig> and mdev <dig>  to be compared to  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively on the extended set . as for 'functional' residues, precisions obtained were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively at mdev <dig> and mdev <dig> . even though precision values between this restricted set and the extended set cannot be compared due to the small size of the former, increase in precision when detecting 'functional' residues as opposed to 'catalytic' residues only  is highly interesting for the biological relevance of our detection method. distribution of mdev values showed that this measure was efficient at discriminating between residues, with very few non-functional residues at high mdev values, as observed e.g. on phenylalanine hydroxylase and the fe3+-binding protein .

discussion
the present study proposes a new method for the prediction of catalytic sites in proteins based on their residue-residue contact networks. this method only relies on the knowledge of protein three-dimensional structures, with no requirement of functional attribution or sequence alignment to other proteins, and can thus directly be applied to proteins with no known homologues.

definition of residue-residue contacts and local network parameters
residue interaction networks were built from protein three-dimensional structures using all non-hydrogen atoms to define contacts between residues. edges were distinguished on whether the atoms involved belonged to the side-chain or backbone of each residue. this distinction proved relevant, since dg1sc  both produced a higher average mdev value over catalytic residues from the extended set and was less correlated to dg <dig> than e.g. dg <dig> .

our results therefore prove that the use of these local  and semi-local  parameters within the residue-interaction network that describes a protein structure enabled a better detection of protein catalytic sites than closeness centrality, a parameter that considers path lengths between all residues of the network. they therefore suggest that local or semi-local organisation of residues is more critical than whole-protein structural information to define them as catalytic or not, as shown by the increased precision of detection obtained over  <dig> representative protein structures . they moreover validate our initial hypotheses of a stronger relevance of chemically significant residue-residue contacts to define catalytic sites.

it is likely that an even better detection shall be achieved in the future by using different types of local network parameters, possibly by combining them to other physico-chemical properties. still, it is to be noted that combination of our two network parameters to the crystallographic b-factor for each residue did not produce a higher precision of the detection than that obtained with the scoring function of equation  <dig> .

choice of binary descriptors
the final performance of the detection was measured using both precision  and coverage, instead of the more classical specificity and sensitivity  combination. this choice was motivated by two reasons: a practical one and a methodological one. the practical reason is the applicability of the method to the choice of protein amino-acids that would be interesting for site-directed mutagenesis experiments. both a high rate of correctly predicted sites, i.e. a low false detection rate, and a high coverage of functional sites, are the characteristics one would require for efficient prediction. indeed, these two criteria will provide both a low rate of negative experiments and a high likelihood of detecting the active site for a given protein. the methodological reason has grounds in the rates of occurences of catalytic residues in the extended set. the  <dig> proteins have  <dig> amino-acids in total, with  <dig> catalytic residues. therefore, the sample is highly unbalanced, with percentages of real positives  and real negatives  over this set of respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % of full sample. in such a case, small variations in the number of correct predictions  will have a low influence on measures of performance that use ratio to the number of residues predicted as non-catalytic , e.g. specificity or true negative rate. on the contrary, similar variations will have a high influence over coverage or predictive value of positives, whose evaluation only involves positive residues . for these two reasons, precision and coverage were chosen as performance measures.

in order to obtain a single measure of performance for our detection, precision and coverage were combined into an effectiveness measure, the f-measure . thresholds on mdev that produced maximal values for this effectiveness measure were chosen in two conditions: one where an equal relative importance was conferred to precision and coverage , and one where precision was given a more important weight . the use of two distinct threshold values provides the user with two sets of residues to analyse of different sizes: a broad set presenting a high coverage, with low chances to miss an active site and more experiments to perform , and a narrow set, with both fewer false positives and lower chances to hit an active site, and also fewer experiments to perform .

comparison to other methods
the final performance of our method was also compared to that proposed by petrova, which uses support vector machine over  <dig> residue attributes. in that study, predictive accuracy +r++r−) is used as a performance measure, for which an optimum value of 87% was obtained  <cit> , while a similar calculation on our method yielded a value of  <dig> % over our extended test set.

lavery and co-workers used calculations of propensity of protein residues to be locally displaced, or mechanical rigidity, as a tool for detecting catalytic sites over various proteins  <cit> . their method produced both a high specificity and coverage of predictions, with respective values of 74% and 78% over  <dig> proteins. these values correspond to a precision of  <dig> % for the detection of catalytic sites. it can also be noted that this method involved time-costing molecular mechanics calculations on each protein structure, in comparison to ours which could be run in a few seconds on each protein.

further comparison to our method can also be performed using the receiver-operator characteristic  curve  though, as discussed earlier, specificity is not a relevant performance measure for such unbalanced samples.

'catalytic' vs. 'functional' residues
when comparing the performance of the method over the extended set and the restricted set, it was observed that a higher precision was obtained on the second one than on the first. one trivial bias could be due to the much smaller size of the validation set, with  <dig> proteins vs.  <dig>  still, an important difference in the measure of precision over the validation set has to be noted. in the catalytic site atlas, residues are labelled as 'catalytic' if they are involved in the catalytic reaction in the strict sense  <cit> . however, when testing the performance of our scoring parameter on the validation set, we manually defined residues that were important for activity on grounds of functional and structural experiments. one difference between the two definitions is, for instance, that residues that bind an active-site metal ion or are involved in substrate docking are considered as functional, in our definition, but are not present in the atlas. we could thus observe that our scoring function, while optimised for detecting 'catalytic' residues from the catalytic site atlas, produced a higher precision at detecting 'functional' residues, both at mdev <dig>  and mdev <dig> , than at detecting purely catalytic sites . it should also be noted that definition of functional residues as used for the validation set, which originates from literature searches for each protein, is likely to be more accurate than that used to define 'catalytic' sites in the csa. indeed, a majority of the residues listed in the csa are defined as catalytic using only information from analogous proteins and sequence comparison methods  <cit> . these results thus further validate the current method as a solid one for detecting functional residues present at enzyme active sites, which can play crucial roles in enzyme activities  <cit> , and not only residues directly involved in catalytic reactions.

CONCLUSIONS
a scoring function based on residue local network descriptors, which did not involve any sequence alignment of the proteins under study or any attribution of function to proteins, was calculated for each residue of a set of proteins with known active sites. residues were labelled as catalytic when their resulting score was superior to a given threshold value, and the threshold was fitted in order to obtain a minimal false detection rate, or maximal precision. our detection method produced a precision of  <dig> % for the catalytic sites of  <dig> proteins with variable folds and function, a more than three-fold increase compared to existing methods . on a smaller set of  <dig> proteins, use of the same method produced a precision of  <dig> % for the detection of catalytic sites and, when extending the measure of performance to all residues that were crucial to protein activity, which we coined 'functional', precision of the detection increased to  <dig> %. the present scoring function, while optimised for 'catalytic' residues, thus proved even more efficient at detecting 'functional' residues. the high precision obtained with this method proved the influence of the local environment of residues in structurally organising protein active sites. the method should be of help in designing site-directed mutagenesis experiments with a low time-cost.

availability
the method can be applied to any protein structure  by submission of a pdb file to the corresponding author. two sets of residues will be produced: one that will only consider the residues predicted as catalytic or functional at high coverage and average precision , and another set, which will be a subset of the previous one, with the residues predicted at high precision and average coverage . an online version for direct submission will soon be available on our web-page .
