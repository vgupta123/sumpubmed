BACKGROUND
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  has recently emerged as promising tool for faecal microbiota monitoring in animal and human faeces  <cit>  since culture-based methods are not suitable for quantification of certain microbial groups, species or strains in faeces  <cit> . due to the role of bifidobacteria as probiotics much attention has been focused on the qpcr-based quantification of both the autochthonous bifidobacteria in faecal microbiota and on selected strains of bifidobacteria after consumption as probiotics  <cit> . compared to fluorescence in situ hybridization , the most widely used method for culture independent quantification in faeces, qpcr is less developed in terms of the availability of specific probes  <cit> . on the other hand qpcr was shown to be about a  <dig> to  <dig> fold more sensitive than culture- and fish-based enumeration techniques  <cit> , as well as to be rapid, easy and more accurate for quantification of low levels of bacteria  <cit> . several oligonucleotides were designed for the bifidobacterium species found in the human intestinal tract, most of them based on the 16s rdna sequence  <cit> . other target sequences like the transaldolase encoding gene  <cit> , heat-shock protein  gene  <cit> , intergenic spacer of the 16s-23s rrna gene  <cit>  are also being investigated for species-specific detection and quantification. oligonucleotides targeting such sequences could also be used for developing qpcr primers.

bifidobacterium thermophilum, being considered as an animal-associated commensal species, was never included in studies on the bifidobacterial composition of the human intestinal flora and to our knowledge, no oligonucleotide was designed for the development of b. thermophilum-specific pcr or qpcr assay until now. recently, design of a pair of oligonucleotides for pcr amplification of a portion of the 16s rdna of b. thermophilum was reported, but effective specificity of the assay was questioned  <cit> . previously, we have isolated and characterized bifidobacteria with anti-listeria activity from stool of newborns  <cit> . strain rbl <dig> was identified as b. thermophilum using 16s rdna sequence homology, comparative hsp <dig> sequence analysis, dna-dna genome hybridization and carbohydrate fermentation patterns  <cit> . this was the first demonstration of the presence of b. thermophilum in human faeces. in this study, we designed oligonucleotides specific for b. thermophilum that we used to develop pcr and qpcr assays to study the distribution of this species in human faecal samples. finally, the qpcr technology let us isolate a strain of b. thermophilum from human infant faeces closely related to b. thermophilum rbl <dig> 

RESULTS
design of a b. thermophilum specific pcr assay
specificity of the b. thermophilum specific primer was assessed by pcr on colonies with primers btherm and the bifidobacterium genus-specific primer lm <dig> . of the  <dig> bifidobacterium and two lactobacillus strains tested, positive signals  were only obtained with the three faecal isolates b. thermophilum rbl <dig>  bifidobacterium thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum rbl <dig> and rbl <dig> , b. thermophilum dsm20210t , and b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t .

detection of b. thermophilum in faecal dna samples by pcr
classical pcr analysis with the b. thermophilum specific primers btherm and lm <dig>  on total dna isolated from faecal samples spiked with known quantities of b. thermophilum rbl <dig> showed that the detection limit of the method was  <dig> b. thermophilum cells per gram faeces . this high detection limit did not allow dna amplification from any of the  <dig> faecal samples. efficacy of pcr amplification on faecal dna samples was confirmed by amplification of a  <dig>  kb-dna fragment from each faecal dna sample generated with the bifidobacterium-genus specific primer-pair lm26/lm <dig>  <cit>  .

development of a qpcr assay for detection of b. thermophilum in human faeces
the qpcr technology was chosen as an alterative to the classical pcr for its higher sensitivity. b. thermophilum specificity of qpcr performed with primers bthermrtf, bthermrtr and the taqman probe bthermtqm  was tested by amplification of dna isolated from six different bifidobacterium strains belonging to four closely related species. a positive signal was obtained for b. thermophilum rbl <dig> , b. thermophilum dsm20210t  and the closely related species b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t , but not for b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t, bifidobacterium breve dsm20213t, and bifidobacterium boum dsm20432t. amplification of dna from b. thermophilum rbl <dig> with this new assay was shown to be linear for dna concentrations ranging from  <dig>  ng/μl  to  <dig> ng/μl  with a regression coefficient r <dig> =  <dig>  .

screening of faecal samples by qpcr
as for the classical pcr approach, the detection limit of the qpcr assay was determined by analysis of dna isolated from spiked faecal samples and was equal to  <dig> ×  <dig> bacterial cells per gram of faeces. detection in faecal samples was shown to be linear between  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per gram of faeces and corresponded to ct values comprised between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, with a regression coefficient r <dig> =  <dig>  . one of the  <dig> faecal samples  gave a positive signal within this range  with a ct value of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , corresponding to a concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per gram faeces.

application of the newly developed qpcr assay for faecal samples
raffinose-bifidobacterium  medium and mrsc-nnlp were tested for isolation of new b. thermophilum strains from human faeces. mrsc-nnlp was chosen for isolation of bifidobacteria because it allowed a better growth of rbl <dig>  and was easier to prepare. approximately 1– <dig> ×  <dig> colonies per gram faeces could be cultivated from all of the  <dig> samples plated on mrsc-nnlp agar. microscopic observations of the isolates showed that the medium was not completely selective, allowing for the growth of non-rod-shaped microorganisms.  <dig> rod-shaped microorganisms were selected for pcr analysis on colony. twenty-five of them were positive with the bifidobacterium genus specific primers lm26/lm <dig>  but only one of them gave a positive signal with btherm/lm <dig>  this isolate, f9k <dig> from a 4-month old breast-fed baby, was streaked several times on mrsc agar and the absence of contaminants other than bifidobacterium was confirmed by three pcr reactions with lm26/lm <dig>  btherm/lm <dig> and bak4/bak11w  <cit>  . sequencing of the 16s rdna fragment amplified with lm <dig> and lm <dig> yielded a 1454-bp sequence which was  <dig> % identical to the 16s rdna of b. thermophilum rbl <dig>  sequence identities with other bifidobacterium strains are summarized in table  <dig> 

*the percentage of identity  was determined by comparison of the sequence of f9k <dig> against the sequences present in the database with the blast tool from ncbi.

discussion
real-time pcr  is known to be a more sensitive technique than classical pcr. this is reflected by our results for specific amplification of 16s rdna from spiked faecal samples, where changing from classical pcr to qpcr for the detection of b. thermophilum in faecal samples lowered the detection limit of the assay from  <dig> to  <dig> cells per gram faeces. the high sensitivity obtained for qpcr in this study is similar to detection limits reported by different groups for other bifidobacterium species or genus specific qpcr assays. matsuki et al.  <cit> , penders et al.  <cit>  and gueimonde et al.  <cit> , for example, reported detection limits of  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cells of bifidobacterium spp. per gram faeces, respectively. the application of a recent qpcr technology using rrna as target molecule combined with reverse transcriptase could further enhance the sensitivity down to  <dig> cells/g faeces  <cit> . this methodology could also be developed for the detection of other subdominant faecal bacteria such as b. thermophilum.

we have developed a qpcr assay which is specific for b. thermophilum although the assay is also positive for the type strain of b. thermacidophilum subsp.porcinum, and b. thermacidophilum subsp.porcinum rbl <dig> and rbl <dig> , but not with b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum   <cit> . based on our published data including dna-dna genome hybrizations  <cit>  we underline that b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum  <cit>  should belong to the b. thermophilum species and consequently, we conclude that our qpcr system is specific for b. thermophilum.

until now, b. thermophilum was considered as an animal-associated species, mainly present in faeces of ruminants and pigs. the amplification of a specific 16s rdna sequence with our qpcr on the children faecal sample c <dig> as well as the isolation of a b. thermophilum isolate from children faeces during this work support the assumption of von ah et al.  <cit>  that presence of b. thermophilum in food cannot be used to discriminate between animal and human bacterial contamination, as previously suggested  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of the development of a qpcr assay for specific detection of b. thermophilum, a species that was not included in analysis of the composition of the bifidobacterial human intestinal microbiota until now. using this assay, we detected b. thermophilum at a concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per gram in one faeces sample, confirming the presence of this species in human faecal material.
