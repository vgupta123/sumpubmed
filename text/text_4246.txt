BACKGROUND
the aim of genome-wide association studies  is to assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms  and common diseases. recent gwas have been successful in discovering snps significantly associated with complex diseases  <cit> . however, published snp associations account for only a fraction of the genetic component of most common diseases  <cit> . lately, several studies have been focused on the association between copy number variants  and disease. some reports have suggested a role of rare cnvs  in susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders  <cit> . other studies have shown statistically significant associations between common cnvs  and common diseases such as psoriasis  <cit> , crohn’s disease  <cit> , hiv-1/aids  <cit> , or alzeheimer’s disease  <cit>  to name a few. these studies indicate that the identification of dna copy number is important in understanding the genesis and progression of human diseases.

several techniques and platforms have been developed for gwas involving cnvs, such as array-based comparative genomic hybridization . for targeted studies, other techniques such as real time pcr, or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  assays have been used to compare the copy number status of particular loci in cases and controls. in both cases, a signal intensity is measured for each cnv as a continuous variable, from which the copy number status is inferred. in many cases, the distribution of the observed cnv probe measurements is continuous and multimodal, representing the unobserved copy number status as a latent variable  <cit> . thus, scoring copy number may lead to misclassification and, hence, unreliable results, making it necessary to incorporate uncertainty in the association analysis. so far, two methods have been developed to analyze cnv data that incorporate uncertainty. the first one performs the calling procedure and incorporates the posterior probabilities in a latent class model  <cit> , while the other is based on a likelihood test that combines calling and testing in a single procedure  <cit> .

despite the existence of these methods, cnv association studies often analyze cnvs with very low uncertainty that are not likely genotyping artefacts. for example, in the gwas performed in the myocardial infarction genetics consortium  <cit>  the authors pointed out that: “ as an initial quality control step,  removed any variant where more than 10% of the copy calls were uncertain”  <cit> . another example is given in  <cit>  were only cnvs without uncertainty are analyzed. such approach allows the use of standard tests such as χ <dig>  fisher or mann-whitney tests  <cit>  to assess differences between cases and controls.

in this article, we present a bayesian shared component model for cnv-based association studies. we illustrate the model with a case study to determine those cnvs that are specific to a given population when comparing individuals belonging to the hapmap project. in this example it is expected to find differences in a large proportion of cnvs due to ethnic background. an example including patients with ovarian cancer is analyzed in order to illustrate how our model identifies phenotype-associated cnvs when a tiny number of cnvs are expected to be differente accross groups. our approach adapts and extends the model suggested by  <cit>  for genetic association studies based on snps to cope with cnvs too. we introduce the bayesian shared component model formulation, the likelihood, priors and hyperpriors as well as the inferential process. we empirically examine its performance by using simulated data. we generated data under two scenarios in order to mimic the type of cnvs that are typically analyzed. the first simulation generates cnvs which can be tagged by snps , while the second one mimics situations in which complex cnvs are studied. the analyzed data sets and proposed methods are available in the r package bayesgenhttp://www.creal.cat/jrgonzalez/software.htm.

methods
data sets
the first motivating data were collected from a genetic study conducted at the center for genomic regulation  in barcelona, spain. the study aimed to determine those cnvs that are specific to major human ethnic groups included in the hapmap project   <cit>  . this type of data can help in the understanding of some mendelian diseases such as cystic fibrosis  <cit>  or deafness  <cit> , that present different prevalences in the different populations. in addition, the genomic variants that are population-specific can guide to drug discovery. for example, the existing population variability in the acetylating activity of the n-acetyltransferase  <dig>  gene makes possible to determine those ethnic groups that are more susceptible to develop some diseases  <cit> .

the second motivating data belongs to an study on ovarian cancer. the data are obtained from the cancer genome atlas  data portal http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ and it includes phenotype and cnv information for  <dig> females. we are interested in determining those cnvs that are specific to each type of response to treatment. in order to address this problem, we analyzed the variable named ‘primary_therapy_outcome_success’ that contains information about the response for the first therapy received. our final data set contains information for  <dig> females, since  <dig> of them did not have information for this variable. this variable had  <dig> categories: ’complete remission’, ’partial remission’, ’stable disease’ and ’progressive disease’. categories ’stable disease’ and ’progressive disease’ were collapsed into one categorie . the copy number data matrix contains the number of copies for each cnv annotated at the database of genomic variants using the genome build grch <dig> .

as previously mentioned, a very simple approach to determine the cnvs that are specific to each subgroup of individuals is to compare the observed cnv frequencies between individuals from different groups  <cit> . one of the main limitations of this approach is that the number of copies may vary between  <dig> and  <dig> and therefore χ <dig>  fisher or mann-whitney tests can be underpowered. in addition, most of the analyzed cnvs have similar frequencies accross ethnic groups, and only a few, if any, show differences between them. therefore, the use of a shared component model can be very useful in the context of cnvs.

the bayesian model
let {xijp ∈ d} be the number of copies of the jth cnv, for the ith individual of population p, where d denotes the set of indices for the observed data, i =  <dig> …,n , j =  <dig> …,c  and p =  <dig> …,p. we assume that all individuals in the same population group have the same chance of having a number of copies in a given cnv, then we observe xijp ∈ { <dig> , <dig> , <dig> …}. the motivation for this assumption relies on the fact that we are looking for associations between cnvs and populations. if a given cnv is linked to a specific population, it is expected that most of the individuals in that population have similar values for that cnv.

now, let yjp=∑i=1njpxijpnjp be the average number of copies found in the jth cnv of the pth population, where njd denotes the number of individuals in population p with non-missing information for the jth cnv. then, by the central limit theorem  <cit> , and assuming independence among individuals we have 

  yjp∼˙n, 

where μjp is the mean number of copies for cnv j in population p and νp <dig> is the variation of the average of cnv frequencies in population p.

we introduce the next shared component formulation with gaussian likelihood to decompose the variability of μjp

  μjp=αp+βp·θj+λjp, 

where αp is a population-specific intercept, θj is the component shared by all populations, βp denotes the loading of the common component into population p and λjp encodes the population-specific components. in order to make the model as flexible as possible we have considered that νp <dig> depends on the population group p. however, a simpler model can also be fitted by considering that yjp has the same variance for each population group, ν <dig>  the likelihood of our proposed model is 

 l∝∏p∏jνp−1expνp−22=∏pνp−jexpνp−2∑j <dig> 

in the bayesian framework, all parameters must be assigned prior distributions that, in turn, may depend on new parameters, which are referred to as hyperparameters. prior distributions  must also be assigned to these. to complete the bayesian formulation, the prior and hyperprior distributions for the model parameters are needed. our basic principle in specifying these distributions is to let the data likelihood dominate over the prior information. to achieve this, it is common to consider prior distributions with large variances that allow for a really wide range of potential values for the parameters thus being non-informative a priori. following this we chose flat prior distributions. we also refer to previous similar studies that specify prior distributions in this way. we assumed the following priors 

 αp∼normalθj∼normalλjp∼t4βp∼normal 

and non-informative hyperpriors for the standard deviations of the random effects 

 σθ,σp∼normal·1i 

for the sake of identifiability we fixed σθ2= <dig>  these priors and hyperpriors are commonly used for full bayesian statistical inference when information about the model parameters is not available. however, in order to account for large values, the specific components, λjp, were considered as zero-mean t-distributions with  <dig> degrees of freedom and unknown variances. the priors and hyperpriors for the asymmetric formulation  are mainly the same, except that we consider β <dig> =  <dig>  where β <dig> corresponds to the reference population.

inclusion of covariates
in almost all situations the disease is affected not only by genetic factors but also by environmental determinants. in these situations the association between the disease and cnvs has to be adjusted by some covariates that indicate whether an individual is exposed or not to those environmental variables. our model can accomodate this information in the case of having categorical covariates  by aggregating the data in more categories. for instance, suppose we have a categorical covariate z taking values in a set of k categories. then, we will have p × k groups and we aggregate the cnv counts over all of them: yjkp=∑ixijkp. the adjustment for z could be introduced in the model as follows: 

 yjkp∼normalμjkp,σkpμjkp=αp+γk+βpθj+λjp+ξjk. 

prior distributions should also be assigned to the additional parameters γk and ξjk. these could be analogous to the priors for αp and λjp.

notice that if we are interested in adjusting by continuous covariates we should create some categories before including them into the model. one possibility is to create some categories using tertiles or quartiles  or use a priori cut-points . a special case when an adjustment for continuous covariates is required appears in genetic studies when the population structure has to be considered. in these cases, principal component analysis  is used to determine subpopulation the structure  <cit> . then association analysis between genetic markers and the disease is performed using logistic regression adjusted for the two principal components instead of using a chi-square test. in this case, after performing pca and using any clustering method, individuals are classified into subpopulations. these subpopulations can be included in the model as previouly mentioned.

estimation of model parameters
the jags software  was used to carry out mcmc posterior sampling using the r package rjags <cit> . we ran the sampler for  <dig>  iterations and considered estimates based on the last  <dig>  runs, allowing a burn-in of  <dig>  iterations. two chains were run for each of the models. convergence was assessed from trace plots. we also used the “potential scale reduction factor” diagnostic proposed by gelman and rubin  <cit> .

mcmc is computationally intensive, even more in the case of analyzing genetic data where normally thousands of genes are analyzed. to overcome this difficulty we also used the integrated nested laplace approximation  approach to make statistical inference of our model. inla provides a fast  deterministic alternative to mcmc  <cit> . the only difference between both approaches is that the model based on inla replaces the t distributions with normals. this, in principle, could shrink cnv-disease risk associations more than the original model, but it runs much faster and it can be applied to gwas. in any case, the t distribution can easily be incorporated when available for inla . we have developed an r package called bayesgen that incorporates both estimating processess as well as some tools for displaying model parameters and evaluating model convergence. the package is available at http://www.creal.cat/jrgonzalez/software.htm.

RESULTS
genomic differences between human populations
armengol et al.  <cit>  showed some cnv loci that are present with different frequencies accross individuals belonging to three human populations , representatives of sub-saharan africa, europe and east asia, respectively. the authors, in a preliminary step, used acgh and bac-based platforms to identify cnv loci with different frequencies in the three populations using pools of individuals. this yielded a total of  <dig> loci whose copy number state frequencies differed among populations. in order to confirm the changes detected with the acgh platforms, they performed validation experiments using mlpa on individual dnas from the hapmap samples. in total they analyzed  <dig> cnv loci . overall, they found  <dig> cnv loci that were specific to any of the three populations after applying standard statistical tests .

the final data set we use for illustration purposes consists of  <dig> cnv loci  and  <dig> individuals  belonging to the mlpa experiment. therefore, our data consists of a  <dig> × 120-dimensional matrix with values corresponding to the observed copy number status xijp ∈ { <dig> , <dig> ,4}. after aggregating the counts of each number of copies over the individuals in each population for each cnv loci we fit the model  <dig> to the aggregated data yjp where j =  <dig> …, <dig> and p∈{ceu,yri,chb/jpt}. using the bayescnvassoc function in the bayesgenr package we ran two chains of  <dig>  iterations. we discarded the first  <dig>  and kept every  <dig> to reduce the autocorrelation in the chains. inference is therefore based on  samples of size  <dig> . we assessed convergence using graphical techniques and the gelman-rubin method and no symptoms of non-convergence were detected. to keep the false discovery rate under control when evaluating whether a specific component was statistically significant or not, we computed credible intervals at  <dig> % level  for λjp’s.

armengol et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> population-specific cnv loci after using χ <dig> or fisher tests. in order to compare the performance of both approaches we tested the existence of population stratification  using a principal component analysis  as suggested in  <cit> . armengol et al. estimated that 30% of the total variance is explained by the two first principal components  using  <dig> cnv loci. in our case, with only  <dig> cnv loci, the two first principal components explain a  <dig> % of the total variability  indicating that our subset of variants discriminates better the individuals.

specific cnv loci associated with response to treatment in ovarian cancer
this data set contains  <dig> cnv loci and  <dig> individuals. the number of observed copies ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  this example was analyzed using inla configuration of bayesgen package. as in the previous example, false discovery rate was controlled by computing credible intervals at a  <dig> % level . table  <dig> shows the estimates for the group-specific intercepts αp for the shared component model under a symmetric formulation . again, as expected, these intercepts are around  <dig>  regarding the specific components, we observe that only  <dig> cnv loci are statistically significant. as previouly mentioned, we were expecting a little number of cnv loci that are specific for each group, since analyzed individuals belong to the same ethnicity. hapmap data showed about 20% of cnv loci to be specific of each subgroup  while in this example only about 1% of cnv loci  are significantly associated with any of the three types of response to treatment. the complete list of specific cnv loci for each group can be found in additional file 1: table s <dig>  figure  <dig> shows λjp estimates. this figure illustrates those cnvs that are specific to get each response after treatment.

simulation studies
in real datasets we can only illustrate the methods, the truth about which cnv loci are really associated with each group is unknown. in order to evaluate our proposed method we carried out a small-scaled simulation study that mimics the real data analysis presented in previous section. we considered three different groups and  <dig> and  <dig>  cnv loci. only two of the cnvs were in a different proportion for one population . we simulated  <dig> different scenarios for the trully associated cnv loci. the first one considers that the two cnv loci are highly associated with one of the populations , the second one considers a moderate increase on risk , while the third one is designed to study the performance of our proposed method in a low risk scenario . the simulation emulates a likely association between thousands of genes and disease. in genetic studies only a few of the analyzed genes are trully associated with the phenotype of interest. for instance, the wtccc analyzed  <dig>  cnv loci among different diseases and only found  <dig> loci associated with disease  <cit> .

the copy number status for the loci were simulated considering two types of cnv data. the first one assumes that cnvs were common, meaning that they can be tagged by snps . in this scenario the copy number status can only be { <dig> ,2}. this kind of data has been obtained by several authors when analyzing cnvs  <cit> . this particular scenario could also be modelled assuming that a common cnv locus follows a binomial distribution and, hence, the model proposed in  <cit>  could also be used. the main advantage of using our formulation is that it can also be applied when cnv loci are not in hwe since the only assumption made is that the mean of the observed number of copies follows a gaussian distribution. this holds in general due to the central limit theorem as we are summing the number of copies for each group of individuals. the second scenario considers polymorphic cnv loci taking values { <dig> , <dig> , <dig> ,6}. this scenario tries to mimic situations in which complex cnvs are analyzed. in both cases we simulated cnv loci assuming hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the allelic frequencies were randomly selected from u trying to reflect the fact that most cnvs are rare cnvs. in addition, in order to assess the performance when analyzing cnps as in  <cit> , we also performed the same simulations assuming that allelic frequencies between  <dig>  and  <dig> . we compared the results obtained from our proposed bayesian shared component model with those obtained with a χ <dig> test, a non-parametric kruskall-wallis test and a multinomial logistic regression comparing the null model versus the model including the cnv using the likelihood ratio test. bonferroni correction was used in order to deal with multiple comparisons. we also computed corrected credible intervals for the specific components. given that the bonferroni-like correction requires estimation of extreme percentiles for the posterior distribution, which are difficult to be obtained from mcmc samples, we computed a credible interval based on the normal approximation. finally, we considered the posterior probability as an alternative criterion to detect significant cnv loci. we compared the different approaches by computing the true positive and negative rates  in  <dig> simulations.

results for the simulation described in simulation studies section for the case of having common cnvs with major allele frequency simulated from u. the different scenarios are described in that section. we compare four different approaches: χ <dig> test, kruskall-wallis , multinomial regression using likelihood ratio test, and our proposed bayesian model. the comparison was based on computing the true positive and negative rates, tpr and tnr respectively. results are expressed in %.

regarding to computation time, we compared the required time to fit a model with  <dig>  cnv loci and  <dig>  individuals  and chi-square approach took 7sec, kruskal-wallis 28sec, multinomial logistic regression 7min 40sec, bayesian model using inla 1min 39sec and bayesian model using mcmc 1h 10m. all computations were done in a workstation dual intel xeon x <dig>  <dig> ghz 2x <dig> mb, quad-core with 32gb ram.

CONCLUSIONS
here we considered the problem of determining copy number variants that are specific to different subgroups of individuals or different subphenotypes when thousand of markers are analyzed and only a few of them are truly associated with a given group. we have demonstrated the utility of our model by analyzing two real datasets. one focuses on describing how to find specific cnv loci for the three major ethnic groups, while the second example illustrates how to detect specific cnv loci related to the response to treatment in patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer. we have implemented a bayesian shared component model to decompose the observed variability in the number of copies of each cnv loci into two components: shared and specific. simulation results showed a better performance than other existing methods.

we established the cnv loci that are specific to each group by computing credible intervals of the posterior mean of the specific components and their posterior probabilities. in order to avoid false positive results, we adopted a bonferroni-like correction. therefore, credible intervals require estimation of extreme percentiles. this may lead to some difficulties when using mcmc samples. thus, we also calculated credible intervals based on normal approximation. simulation studies showed that this method slightly outperforms the method based on percentiles.

the model has been formulated using a hierarchical structure. therefore, it is straightforward to add further levels of hierarchy if needed. for instance, cnvs can be in the same pathway or may have the same function. thus, this information can be incorporated in the model in order to estimate better the effect of each cnv locus, as described in  <cit> . this new structure could be easily incorporated into our model by introducing a new hierarchy on top of the cnv loci. there are several ways this could be done. one could be as follows: imagine that a cnv j is involved in pathway g. then, we could simply replace the prior distribution 

 λjp∼t <dig> σp <dig> 

 by 

 λjp∼t4ωgp,σp <dig> 

 and then assign hyperpriors to the parameters ωgp that would pick up the variation at the pathway level. with this formulation, large values of ωgp would indicate an association between pathway g and population p.

our model considers that the number of copies for each cnv locus is measured without uncertainty, as considered by some authors  <cit> . in principle this could be a limitation, but this is a problem related to the technology used to obtain information about cnvs and calling algorithms. notice that some of the cnv studies obtain information about cnvs using snp array data  <cit>  that are not designed to detect such type of markers. nonetheless, several authors have pointed out that this will not be a problem with the use of next generation sequencing  methods  <cit> . this technology is already capable of detecting cnvs by taking advantage of read mapping and having a very low false positive rate  <cit> . in addition, as ngs continues to improve as well as computational methods of cnv calling, the uncertainty surronding cnv calls will fall rapidly, making our method to be valid.

we conclude that our proposed model is useful to discover specific genetic variants for different subgroups of individuals. this could help in determining differences in disease predisposition or response to pharmaceutical treatments. estimating model parameters can be very time consuming, however we have developed an r package  that not only includes mcmc methods but also a fast estimation of the posterior distribution based on inla that provides estimates for a whole chromosome in a few minutes.
