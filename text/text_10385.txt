BACKGROUND
many classes of genome sequence variation occur in the malaria parasite p. falciparum that may contribute to variation in pathogenicity, including single nucleotide polymorphism   <cit> , insertion and deletion of short sequences   <cit> , large scale deletions  <cit> , amplifications  <cit> , inversions  <cit> , and translocations  <cit> . analysis of diversity in the ~ <dig>  mb parasite genome has focused predominantly upon the detection of snps and indels  <cit>  by dna re-sequencing methods, although the power of oligonucleotide microarray hybridisation for detecting sequence polymorphism has also been applied  <cit> . this has shown that p. falciparum genes encoding surface proteins possess a higher than average level of sequence diversity, whereas genes encoding proteins with mitochondrial, metabolic and cell growth functions have low diversity  <cit> . recombination rate has also been shown to be variable along the length of each chromosome, being particularly high in the sub-telomeres  <cit> .

genome sequencing can be utilised for detecting gene deletions and amplifications  <cit>  although alternative methods such as dna microarray platforms also allow copy number variable regions of the genome to be robustly detected on a large scale. these cnv regions play a prominent role in the adaptive biology of the parasite. for example, sub-telomeric deletions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have been linked to a loss of infected erythrocyte cytoadherence through deletion of genes encoding adhesion molecules  <cit> . conversely, mefloquine resistance is conferred through amplification of a multi-genic locus on chromosome  <dig> including the multi-drug transporter pfmdr <dig> gene  <cit> . hybridisation of labelled genomic dna to microarrays can detect amplified or deleted sequences, and depending upon probe density the spectrum of dna sequence variation that can be detected ranges from snps up to copy number variants in the mb size range  <cit> . early studies using microarray platforms  <cit>  demonstrated polymorphism within the sub-telomeres of chromosomes in the hb <dig> strain and a panel of sub-clones from a single p. falciparum isolate  respectively, and more recent studies identified novel cnv genes by using arrays to assay small panels of different p. falciparum isolates  <cit> .

cnvs have been shown to be correlated with repetitive sequences in the genomes of humans and model organisms, highlighting the role of non-allelic homologous recombination in the genesis of variants  <cit> . consistent with this, amplicon breakpoints in the p. falciparum mefloquine resistance locus on chromosome  <dig> and surrounding the gtp cyclohydrolase amplicon are within microsatellite regions or repetitive monomeric a/t tracts  <cit> . in comparison with snp mutation rates in eukaryotic genomes in the order of ~10-8-10- <dig> per nucleotide site per generation, it has been estimated that large deletion or amplification mutations occur at a rate ~10- <dig> per nucleotide site per generation  <cit> . it has been postulated that gene duplications safeguard against deleterious mutations  <cit> , and allow more rapid rates of evolution within coding sequences  <cit> , as one gene copy retains gene function whilst the other has reduced constraint to accrue new mutations. conversely, deletions are suggested to be more often under purifying selection, and thus purged from populations  <cit> .

to identify commonly amplified and deleted genes, and test for associations with factors that could contribute to their generation and selection, a genome-wide survey of cnv genes was performed on diverse cultured lines of p. falciparum, using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray platform.

RESULTS
cnv genes are non-randomly distributed throughout the p. falciparum genome
genomic dna extracted from  <dig> in vitro cultured isolates was hybridised to the high density custom affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray pfsanger. cnv genes were identified as those possessing a log <dig> ratio in any isolate that was in excess of  <dig>  or below - <dig>  corresponding to a doubling or halving of signal intensity compared to the median signal intensity for that locus across all isolates . in total,  <dig> genes showed hybridisation signals consistent with deletion or amplification in one or more isolate. in each isolate between  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed evidence of deletion or amplification . these putative cnv genes were observed on all  <dig> chromosomes, though the pattern of variation was non-random . there was an excess of cnv genes towards chromosomal ends, with  <dig>  cnv genes within previously defined chromosome sub-telomere regions   <cit> , and  <dig>  at more internal chromosomal loci . hence,  <dig> % of genes in the subtelomeres are observed as cnv compared with  <dig> % in internal regions. this was exemplified by chromosome  <dig>  on which all cnv genes were detected in sub-telomeric regions . overall, there was a highly significant skew toward sub-telomeric location for cnv genes compared with non-cnv genes . the proportion of all genes on each chromosome detected as cnv genes decreased with chromosomal length, as expected since sub-telomeric regions take up a lower proportion of the larger chromosomes .

expected values were calculated under the assumption that each property is distributed evenly throughout the genome

the sub-telomeres are typified by repeat regions, large multi-gene families  and segmental duplications and share considerable homology among chromosomes. there was no association of cnv genes with internal var clusters on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  nor with identified segmental duplications, and only a weak association with centromeres was shown . a strong association  with proximity to segmental duplications was however observed.

detection of previously identified cnv genes
several phenotypically important cnv regions have been previously characterised in the parasite lines investigated in this study. these include a sub-telomeric deletion of a region of chromosome  <dig> including the annotated genes cytoadherence linked asexual gene  <dig> , ring exported protein  and gametocyte implicated protein . this truncation is frequently observed during adaptation to long-term culture in p. falciparum strains  <cit> . this was seen in d <dig>  ro <dig>  t9/ <dig>  t9/ <dig>  k <dig>  mad <dig>  and d <dig> in our experiments, extending beyond clag <dig> in all strains except d <dig> where hybridisation indicates a deletion may have occurred between clag <dig> and pfi1735c .

mefloquine resistance is caused by amplification of a multi-genic locus surrounding the pfmdr <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  and has been shown to be highly copy number dependant  <cit> . the dd <dig> and w2mef parasites are related clones, derived from a single progenitor selectively grown under mefloquine selection to produce drug resistant parasites  <cit> . here, hybridisation indicated an increased signal for pfmdr <dig> in dd <dig> and w2mef . the extent of the amplification in dd <dig> encompassed  <dig> genes from pfe1095w to pfe1160w, in complete agreement with previously published microarray data  <cit> . here the exact same boundaries of the amplification are found for w2mef.

cnv genes are mostly rare and non-consecutive
approximately half of the total of putative cnvs  were each detected in only a single parasite line . a slight bias in these rare cnv genes was noted, amplifications  being more frequent than deletions  compared with  <dig> amplifications and  <dig> deletions detected in  <dig> or more isolates . further analysis focused upon the 'common' cnv genes, detected in  <dig> or more isolates, as these were considered most important and least likely to have originated in culture or to be due to any artefact , this still represents a substantial level of genetic variation affecting  <dig> % of the coding sequence of the genome.

the distribution of size polymorphism in the p. falciparum genome and the number of consecutively identified cnv genes was determined, revealing relatively few runs of two or more cnv genes . there was also a trend towards small genes  being more frequently variable than larger genes .

confirmation and identity of deleted genes
validation of deletions in the dd <dig> and hb <dig> genomes was performed using bioinformatic searches of published sequence data aligned to the 3d <dig> genome. eleven of  <dig> putative deletions in dd <dig> from the microarray data were supported by the absence of the gene in the dd <dig> genome sequence , the exceptions being pf14_ <dig> and pf11_ <dig> , and pfe0070w . five of  <dig> putative deletions in the hb <dig> genome were confirmed by the absence of the genes in the hb <dig> sequence , the exceptions being pff0860c  and pfi0060c . as a control comparison, a random set of  <dig> genes  that were classed as 'present' in both the dd <dig> and hb <dig> hybridisations were examined.  <dig> % of these genes were identified in the hb <dig> sequence suggesting that deletions confirmed by bioinformatic methods are unlikely to be a product of lack of genome coverage, whereas a smaller majority  was identified in the dd <dig> sequence, consistent with the higher number of unclosed gaps in the current draft dd <dig> genome compared to hb <dig> 

this high level of confirmation of results from the array platform allowed the identification of novel deletions to be catalogued in the p. falciparum genome. for example, the pfsbp <dig>  gene was determined as 'deleted' along with an adjacent gene  in three strains . examination of the dd <dig> genome sequence revealed a truncation of the pfsbp <dig> gene  explaining the low hybridisation signal observed on the microarray. gene knock-out studies on pfsbp <dig>  encoding the skeleton binding protein, have previously shown it as important in the trafficking of pfemp <dig> to the erythrocyte cell surface  <cit> . deletion of two glycophorin binding protein genes with high  sequence identity on different chromosomes was also identified: gbph  in dd <dig>  fcc- <dig> and 7g <dig> and gbph <dig>  in d <dig>  fcc- <dig> and t9/ <dig>  as deletion of both genes was detected in a single strain  it is likely that function is either complemented by gene paralogues  or redundant for in vitro cultured parasites.

overall, the putative cnv genes included many hypothetical genes . the proportion of cnvs was elevated in the rifin  and stevor  gene families. other gene families also showed a high proportion of cnv genes, pfmc-2tm , large ribosomal subunit protein , histone  , fikk protein kinase  and etramp . however, a high proportion of cnv was not detected among var genes , though truncated and pseudogenic var genes exhibited high levels of cnv , confirming that the polymorphism observed in pfemp <dig> proteins is most probably due to recombination events between members of the var genes rather than amplification and/or deletion  <cit> .

cnv genes share common features
there was a deficit in cnv genes with orthologues to other plasmodium species  with  <dig> % of common cnvs and  <dig> % of rare cnv genes being p. falciparum specific. a large number of these species-specific genes in the p. falciparum genome are exported to the infected erythrocyte cell surface and possess transmembrane domains, though we found no excess of cnv among genes containing the major signal peptide associated with export to the cell surface , and only a weakly significant excess of genes containing transmembrane domains .

duplicated genes have been hypothesised to possess a higher than neutral level of polymorphism due to relaxation of selective constraint. we used a published dataset of  <dig>  values  <cit>  of per gene nucleotide diversity  to determine if the cnvs detected in this study showed increased sequence polymorphism, compared to non-cnv genes. a significant excess of polymorphism was detected for both the distribution of π values , and the proportion of cnv genes with values of π greater than the overall average . there was a slight excess of deleted genes, with 57% of cnv genes above the average pairwise π being deleted and 43% being amplified, although this was not significant .

no association was seen in the distribution of monomeric a/t tracts in cnv genes and  <dig> kb of surrounding intergenic sequence up- and down-stream of the gene coding sequences, compared to non-cnv genes . this was consistent when cnv in subtelomeric genes or non-subtelomeric genes were considered separately . however, sequence encompassing amplified genes  showed a significantly skewed distribution toward shorter a/t tract lengths when compared to deleted genes  and non-cnv genes .

snps located within probe sequences have been shown to reduce binding of target dna hybridised to the array, in the case of exceptionally highly polymorphic genes. to determine if the modest excess in polymorphism observed in deleted cnvs was due to an artefact of lower hybridisation, the relationship between sequence diversity and hybridisation signal was examined. snps relative to the 3d <dig> genome were downloaded from whole genome sequencing projects for the parasite clones dd <dig> and hb <dig> http://www.plasmodb.org. overall, no association between the gene level hybridisation signal and the density of snps in each gene  was observed .

discussion
the distribution of cnv genes in plasmodium falciparum shows consistency with what has been seen in the genomes of higher eukaryotes  <cit> . the excess of smaller sized cnv genes is in accordance with general predictions  <cit> . the small proportion of consecutive cnv genes indicates that cnv regions in p. falciparum are mostly very small, although there are notable exceptions previously known that were also detected here. sub-telomeric regions of p. falciparum have evolved as hotspots of genetic diversity, typified by a high proportion of species specific genes, segmental duplications, nucleotide diversity, high mutation and recombination rates. results here show that cnv genes are also common in sub-telomeric regions, and have highlighted features relevant to the mutational origin and selective pressures of cnv genes in p. falciparum. given the pivotal role of segmental duplications in cnv generation in the genomes of humans and mice  <cit> , it seems likely that a similar role could occur in malaria parasites. no complete segmental duplications were detected as either amplified or deleted in this study, though it has been previously shown that segmental duplications are copy number variable in the p. falciparum genome resulting in transcriptional up- and down-regulation of their gene complement  <cit> . the sub-telomeres possess large gene families containing regions of high sequence homology, and we have identified a number of these as being putative cnv genes. this suggests that mechanisms such as non-allelic homologous recombination  may be key to the generation of copy number variation, through recombination of regions of homology either intra- or inter chromosomally  <cit> .

the function of deleted genes may be frequently complemented by closely related genes, suggesting that most cnv has no adverse effect on phenotype, and is thus nearly neutral  <cit> . however, in vitro culture of parasites might allow the maintenance of a greater number of mildly deleterious alleles than in natural populations due either to the reduction in effective population size that would generally increase the effect of genetic drift, or to the relaxation of some specific selective constraints in vitro. this is highlighted by the deletion in vitro of pfsbp <dig>  an important transporter of pfemp <dig> to the erythrocyte cell surface, in three of the parasite lines, a loss that may be non-viable in natural infection due to a failure to cytoadhere to the microvasculature and evade immune responses. an unknown proportion of the variation presented here may not have originated in the natural environment, so parasites sampled directly from patients will need to be examined to exclude the effect of culture adaptation.

genomic organisation between rodent malaria parasites and p. falciparum is well conserved, and arranged in large blocks of syntenic genes, between which species specific genes have evolved  <cit> . the deficit of cnv genes with orthologues to rodent or macaque malaria parasites suggests two possible causes that are not mutually exclusive: 1) there is strong negative  selection on the "core" plasmodium genes and disruption of these has a deleterious effect. 2) p. falciparum specific genes tend to be under strong positive  selection and this favours the maintenance of population-wide cnv.

many of the p. falciparum specific genes encode known antigens and exported proteins from the intra-erythrocytic stage of the parasite lifecycle. the presence of multiple copies of these genes allows the generation of antigenic variants within a single genome, greatly facilitating immune escape of the parasite. a significant association with increased nucleotide diversity in the cnv genes identified in this study is consistent with this. the higher values of π detected in loss cnvs may be attributable to technical limitations of the comparison, there was poor sequence coverage of cnv genes in the dataset used   <cit> . high coverage sequencing that is underway on a large number of p. falciparum isolates will further refine our understanding of evolutionary constraints and modifications on the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate the existence of gene amplifications and deletions  throughout the plasmodium falciparum genome by comparing diverse culture-adapted isolates. these gene cnvs correlate to subtelomeric location, short gene length, nucleotide diversity and low orthology to closely related plasmodium species. we have discussed cnv as an important evolutionary mechanism, allowing the adaptive expansion of diverse gene families whilst copy number of core "housekeeping" genes are maintained by negative selection. in addition to this we have noted the occurrence of previously undetected gene cnvs and highlighted those with a potential phenotypic importance to clinical disease. however, host selective pressures are relaxed in vitro and may allow for some deleterious rearrangements than would not be seen in vivo, so studies directly on clinical isolates will also be important.
