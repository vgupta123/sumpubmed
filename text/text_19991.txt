BACKGROUND
it is of general interest to identify important sites of a protein, for example when elucidating the reaction mechanism of an enzyme. to support this task, classifiers have been developed, which utilize different kinds of information about the protein under study. some algorithms are based on sequences  <cit> , other ones make use of 3d-data  <cit> , and a third class combines both approaches  <cit> .

a strong argument in favor of sequence-based methods is their broad applicability and their potential to characterize proteins with a novel fold. additionally, some signals seem to be more pronounced in sequence- than in 3d-space  <cit> . commonly, these methods depend on a multiple sequence alignment  composed of a sufficiently large number of homologs. based on the assumption that critical residues are not altered during evolution, the canonical feature to identify important residue-positions in an msa is the conservation of individual columns. the degree of conservation can help to predict a role: in many cases, strictly conserved residues are essential for protein function  <cit> . in contrast, a prevalent but not exclusively found amino acid is often important for protein stability  <cit> , which similarly holds for ligand-binding sites. thus, for a precise discrimination, several properties have to be interpreted. features that improve prediction of functionally important sites are the conservation of proximate residues  <cit>  and the abundance of amino acid residues observed at catalytic sites  <cit> . in addition, implicit features deduced from protein sequences have been utilized, like the predicted secondary structure and the predicted solvent accessible surface of residues  <cit> .

most of the existing algorithms focus on the identification of sites relevant for protein function. in order to broaden the classification spectrum, we implemented the sequence-based algorithm clips-1d, which predicts functionally important sites in addition to residue-positions crucial for protein structure in a mutually exclusive manner. it is based on a multiclass support vector machine, which assesses not more than seven properties deduced from residue-positions and their local neighborhood in sequence space. our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art classifiers and predicts catalytic residue-positions with a mean mcc-value of  <dig> . the mean mcc-value is for structurally important sites  <dig>  and for ligand-binding sites it is  <dig> . our findings show that separating ligand-binding sites and structurally important sites is difficult due to their similar properties and that classification quality depends on the residue type.

RESULTS
analysis of local conservation and abundance signals allows for a state-of-the-art classification
high-quality datasets consisting of catalytic sites, ligand-binding sites, and sites important for protein structure are required to train and assess support vector machines , which predict the respective roles of residue-positions. based on the content of ebi-databases, we prepared the redundancy-free and non-overlapping sets cat_sites and lig_sites, which consist of  <dig> catalytic sites and  <dig> ligand-binding sites deduced from a set of  <dig> enzymes named enz . whereas the full set of functionally important sites is known for many enzymes, residues that crucially determine structure have not been identified for a representative set of proteins. thus, to compile such sites, we had to follow an indirect approach  <cit>  by assuming that residues in the core of proteins lacking enzymatic function are conserved due to their relevance for structure. this notion is supported by the fact that conserved hydrophobic core-residues can contribute substantially to protein stability  <cit> . by re-annotating a comprehensive set of non-enzymes from reference  <cit> , we culled the dataset non_enz, which consists of  <dig> proteins. non_enz contains  <dig> buried residue-positions, which are more conserved than the mean ; we designated these sites struc_sites. for all proteins under study, msas were taken from the hssp database  <cit>  and filtered prior to analysis.

next, we identified features, which allow for a state-of-the-art classification of cat_sites, lig_sites, and struc_sites. thus, we trained three two-class  svms to predict for each residue-position k, whether it is important for catalysis , ligand-binding , or protein structure  and compared performance values. in the end, the features used to characterize each k were in the case of svmcat a normalized jensen-shannon divergence consjsd  ) and an abundance-value abund scoring the occurrence of residues at cat_sites according to formula . the proximity of k was assessed by means of a weighted score consneib ) and a novel abundance-value abundneib, deduced from conditional frequencies in the Â±  <dig> neighborhood  <cit>  of cat_sites ). thus, abundneib compares the local environment of site k with the one observed for residues aask at positions annotated as catalytic sites. in order to quantify the contribution of individual features to classification quality, performance was determined for svms exploiting either all four features or a combination of three features, respectively. analogously, scores for lig_sites were computed, and svmlig was trained and assessed.

it is difficult to unambiguously determine a classifier's performance, if the numbers of positive and negative cases differ to a great extent, as is here the case. this is why we computed a battery of performance values, which are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  their comparison confirms for our problem that the performance measures support each other, thus we focus on mcc-values  <cit> , which are also listed in table  <dig>  the mcc-values for svmcat and svmlig were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. mcc-comparison makes clear that for cat_sites and lig_sites all four features add to classification quality. for cat_sites, consjsd  and abund contributed most, for lig_sites, the conservation score consjsd was most relevant; compare additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  which shows roc and proc curves.

the line "2c-svm" gives mcc-values resulting from a classification of catalytic sites  with svmcat, of ligand-binding sites  with svmlig, and of structurally important sites  with svmstruc. the line "clips-1d" shows the performance of the mc-svm. for frpred, performance resulting from the analysis of hssp-msas is given. for cat_sites and lig_sites, mcc-values are listed resulting from frcons-cat or frcons-lig scores of at least  <dig> or  <dig>  respectively. for struc_sites, the same percentage of false positives resulted from frcons-cat and frcons-lig predictions.

can svmcat and svmlig compete with state-of-the-art classifiers? for the assessment, we selected frpred, which has outperformed other approaches and which additionally exploits the predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility  <cit> . it has reached 40% precision at 20% sensitivity for the identification of catalytic residues and is accessible as a web service  <cit> . frpred lists two subtypes of predictions, frcons-cat for catalytic sites and frcons-lig for ligand-binding sites. all results are scored with values of 0-9; the higher the score, the more probable is a functional role of the residue. a classification of cat_sites and lig_sites with frpred resulted in mcc-values of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , when considering predictions scored  <dig> as positive cases. for predictions scored at least  <dig>  the mcc-values were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. interestingly, performance was better, when we uploaded our preprocessed hssp-msas than when frpred compiled msas on itself , which indicates the high quality of these specifically filtered msas. in summary, the comparison of performance values for frpred, svmcat, and svmlig confirmed that the four features selected by us account for a state-of-the-art classification.

using corresponding features and the set struc_sites, we analogously trained svmstruc for the prediction of residue-positions important for structure, which gave an mcc-value of  <dig> . classification quality was determined to the greatest extent by consjsd . when classifying without this feature, mcc was lowered to  <dig> . utilizing the feature abundneib deteriorated performance; a higher mcc-value  was gained by an svm trained on the remaining three features. even abund had only a marginal effect, although the respective scores differ considerably from those of abund and abund; compare table  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  thus, in proteins without enzymatic function, the assessment of conservation contributed most to separate the conserved buried residues from all other ones, which constitute the negative cases. frpred predicted with score  <dig> 22% and with score  <dig> 41% of the struc_sites as catalytic sites or ligand-binding sites; see table  <dig> 

the score-values were deduced from residues belonging to the respective classes. see formula  for a definition of the scores.

clips-1d: towards a more diversified prediction of residue function
in order to elaborate the subtle differences distinguishing functionally and structurally important residue-positions, all combinations of the above training sets have to be exploited. this is why we prepared a multi-class support vector machine  for clips-1d, which was trained on the four classes cat_sites, lig_sites, struc_sites, and noann_sites, i.e., all residue-positions from non_enz not selected as struc_sites. due to the above findings on 2c-svms, we chose the following seven features: consjsd , consneib, abund, abund, abund, abundneib, and abundneib. the mc-svm outputs a list of four class-specific probability values pclass. based on the largest pclass-values, residue-positions were assigned one of the four classes; the resulting distributions are shown in figure  <dig>  65% of the cat_sites and 76% of the struc_sites were correctly assigned. 64% of the lig_sites and 19% of noann_sites were misclassified, and each class contributed a noticeable fraction of false positives. 13% of the struc_sites were classified as cat_sites and 10% as lig_sites. although the algorithm frequently failed to assign the correct class, separating positions with and without a crucial role was more successful: 96% of the cat_sites, 65% of the lig_sites, and 98% of the struc_sites were classified as structurally or functionally important and 81% of the noann_sites were classified as having no crucial function. it turned out that the respective mcc-value was optimal, if cat_sites with pcat >  <dig>  were selected as positives. in summary, the corresponding mcc-values were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for cat_sites, lig_sites, and struc_sites; see table  <dig>  in comparison with 2c-svms, the performance on cat_sites improved moderately. however, the performance on lig_sites and struc_sites dropped, which indicates that the separation of lig_sites and struc_sites is difficult.

the comparison of abund()-values  makes clear that residues are unevenly distributed among the classes, which must influence the residue-specific classification quality. thus, we determined class-specific mcc-values for each residue, which are listed in table  <dig>  as expected, performance differs drastically for individual residues and between classes. among cat_sites, arg, asp, cys, his, lys, and ser were predicted with high quality. most of the other mcc-values were near zero and no mcc-value could be computed for pro and val due to empty sets. the performance-values for lig_sites were generally lower. among struc_sites, the mean mcc-value for the hydrophobic residues ala, ile, leu, met, phe, pro, trp, and val was  <dig> ; the mean of all hydrophilic ones was  <dig> . in summary, these findings proposed to determine classification quality in more detail by computing class- and residue-specific p-values . thus, the user can assess the statistical significance of each individual prediction. table  <dig> lists the resulting performance for p-value cut-offs of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . as can be seen, specificity is high in all cases; sensitivity and precision are lower and class-dependent.

the mcc-values were determined in a class- and residue-specific manner. due to missing cases, mcc-values could not be determined for pro and val residues at cat_sites.

the three performance measures were determined  by selecting as positive cases all residue-positions with a p-value not greater than the given cut-off. labels: "cat" cat_sites, "lig" lig_sites, "struc" struc_sites.

an alternative to clips-1d is the algorithm conseq, which predicts functionally or structurally important residue-positions but does not distinguish catalytic and ligand-binding sites. based on the analysis of five proteins, a success rate of  <dig>  has been reported  <cit> . in order to estimate the performance of the latest conseq version  <cit> , we have uploaded one sequence for each of the first five enz and no_enz entries  and used the web server with default parameters. as conseq does not differentiate between catalytic sites and ligand-binding sites, the union of cat_sites and lig_sites was considered as positives in this case. for the combination of these residue-positions, sensitivity was  <dig> , specificity  <dig> , and precision  <dig> ; for struc_sites the values were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. a comparison of the performance values indicates that clips-1d can compete with conseq.

utilizing clips-1d as a web service
a version of clips-1d trained on the full datasets is available as a web service at http://www-bioinf.uni-regensburg.de/. its usage requires to upload an msa in multiple fasta-format; the result will be sent to the user via email.

to illustrate the application of clips-1d, we present an analysis of the enzyme indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase , which is found in many mesophilic and thermophilic species. igps belongs to the large and versatile family of 8-barrel proteins, which is one of the oldest folds  <cit> . additionally, folding kinetics  <cit>  and 3d-structure of igps  <cit>  have been studied in detail.

we analyzed the hssp-msa related to pdb-id 1a <dig>  i.e. the igps from sulfolobus solfataricus. table  <dig> lists all clips-1d predictions with a p-value â¤  <dig> . according to the respective pdb-sum page  <cit> , e <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  e <dig>  n <dig>  and s <dig> are the catalytic residues. besides n <dig>  which was predicted as lig_site, the other  <dig> sites were correctly identified as cat_sites. the sites which have contact to the ligand were classified as follows: cat_sites e <dig>  lig_sites i <dig>  struc_sites f <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  noann_sites g <dig>  g <dig>  s <dig>  classified as lig_sites were also k <dig>  i <dig>  and s <dig>  which are all neighbors of catalytic sites.  <dig> residues were predicted as struc_sites; figure  <dig> shows that all belong to the core of the protein. their function will be discussed below.

the first two columns give the residue and its position in sigps. the following four columns list the probabilities for the residue's membership with cat_sites, lig_sites, struc_sites, or noann_sites. the column labeled "p-value" lists the p-value for the class with max. the columns "cs" and "lbs" indicate the classification of known catalytic and ligand-binding sites. the last column lists the annotation deduced for residues predicted as struc_sites. meaning of labels: "cat", "lig", "struc", residues predicted as cat_sites, lig_sites, or struc_sites, respectively. "sc" element of a stabilization center pair in sigps, "sce" ditto in eigps, "sr" stabilization residue in sigps; see  <cit> . "fc" element of the folding core; see  <cit> . "ia" interaction with substrate; see  <cit> . "n" no function assigned.

strengths and weaknesses of clips-1d
adding the class struc_sites allowed us to compare properties of functionally and structurally important residue-positions and to assess their impact on classification quality.

for cat_sites, the abundance scores indicate a strong bias of arg, asp, glu, his, and lys towards catalytic residue-positions, which is in agreement with previous findings  <cit> . cat_sites, which were classified as structurally important, were most frequently cys and tyr residues. both residues are not exceedingly overrepresented at catalytic sites and abund- and abund-values are similarly high; compare table  <dig>  for extracellular proteins, structurally important cys residues are frequently involved in disulphide bonds. thus, algorithms like disulfind  <cit>  can help to clarify clips-1d's cys classification.

least specific was the classification of lig_sites, which also suffered the most drastic loss of performance. the mcc-value dropped from  <dig>   to  <dig> , and most misclassifications gave struc_sites, which is due to the similarity of these sites with respect to the features used for classification: for both classes, consjsd is most relevant for classification success, and among all combinations of abundance-values the pairs abund and abund differ least; compare table  <dig>  the similarity of these residue-positions is further confirmed by the large number of struc_sites classified as functionally important by frpred, which additionally suggests that the assessment of the predicted secondary structure and the predicted solvent accessibility contributes little to discriminate functionally and structurally important sites. it follows that lig_sites and struc_sites span a fuzzy continuum, which cannot be divided by means of the considered sequence-based features. on the other hand, each mcc-value characterizes a binary classification and underestimates the performance of clips-1d. for example, when assessing the performance of lig_sites via an mcc-value, residue-positions classified as struc_sites were counted as false-negatives. a more detailed analysis of figure  <dig> and the findings on sigps illustrate that lig_sites were often classified as cat_sites or struc_sites and not as sites without any function , which is a drastic difference not considered by an mcc-value.

for struc_sites, the mcc-value decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the above reasons; however, the mcc-value is still considerably high. can one make plausible, why these buried residue-positions are preferentially occupied by a specific set of residues? at mean, hydrophobic interactions contribute 60% and hydrogen bonds 40% to protein stability; for the stability of larger proteins, hydrophobic interactions are even more important  <cit> . the fraction of misclassified hydrophobic struc_sites was low; compare mcc-values of table  <dig>  thus, clips-1d identifies with high reliability conserved residues of the protein's core, which are most likely important for protein stability. on the other hand, the analysis of abund-values  shows that not all struc_sites are conserved hydrophobic residues: the hydrophobic residues ala, ile, met, and val are underrepresented, whereas the hydrophilic residues cys, gly, and tyr are overrepresented. additionally, the comparison of abundance scores indicates a preference of leu, phe, and pro for structurally relevant sites. these preferences reflect the specific function of these residues for secondary structure  <cit> . additionally, the score-values demonstrate that clips-1d does not exclusively select ilv-residues, which are considered important for protein folding  <cit> . struc_sites, misclassified as catalytic ones, were often arg, asp, and glu, which shows that the abund-values have a strong effect on classification. noann_sites predicted as cat_sites were frequently arg, asp, and his; gly, ser, and thr were often predicted as lig_sites. most likely, at least some of these residue-positions belong to binding sites on the protein-surface e.g. protein-protein interfaces. identifying these residues is possible  <cit> , but beyond the scope of this study.

struc_sites are crucial elements of the sigps structure
a detailed comparison of the two thermostable variants sigps from s. solfataricus  <cit> , tigps from thermotoga maritima, and the thermolabile eigps from escherichia coli has made clear that these thermostable proteins have  <dig> strong salt bridges more than eigps, and that only  <dig> of  <dig> salt bridges in tigps and sigps are topologically conserved  <cit> . it follows that clips-1d can only identify the specific subset of structurally important residue-positions which are relevant for most of the homologous proteins constituting the msa under study. for sigps, tigps, and eigps stabilization centers  and stabilization residues  have been determined  <cit> . residues of scs form tight networks of cooperative interactions which are energetically stabilized; srs are embedded into a conserved hydrophobic 3d-neigborhood.  <dig> residue-positions of sigps were classified as struc_sites by clips-1d.  <dig> of these  <dig> residue-positions as well as the  <dig> false-positive lig_sites are a sc or sr residue in one of the three homologous enzymes; compare table  <dig>  for sigps, the structure of folding cores, i.e. local substructures, which form early during protein folding has been determined by means of hd exchange experiments  <cit> .  <dig> of the struc_sites belong to fragments, which are strongest protected against deuterium exchange , which indicates their significant role in the partially folded protein. a molecular dynamics study  <cit>  and a comparison of enzyme variants  <cit>  have made clear that two more struc_sites belong to loops interacting with the substrate. when combining the above findings, only  <dig> of the  <dig> struc_sites have no accentuated function, which confirms the relevance of these sites for the enzyme's structure.

main application of clips-1d: predicting important sites of uncharacterized proteins
for the test cases of the casp  <dig> contest, the firestar  <cit>  and the i-tasser  <cit>  server have reached mcc-values of  <dig>  when predicting functionally important residues; the performance of other servers has been substantially lower  <cit> . both servers utilize the transfer of information from evolutionary related and well-characterized proteins. if applicable, this approach allows for a superior prediction quality. however, it fails completely if the function of homologous proteins is unknown. for such cases, methods are required that identify functionally and structurally important sites by analyzing conservation signals and propensity values. in contrast to conseq  <cit>  and frpred  <cit> , clips-1d predicts a specific role in catalysis, ligand-binding, or structure for each residue-position. the only prerequisite for its application is the existence of a sufficiently large number of homologous sequences, which can easily be combined to an msa and which should be filtered according to our experience.

the number of genes which lack annotated homologs is huge: in mid  <dig>  the pfam database  <cit>  contained nearly  <dig> domains of unknown function. additionally, a comparison of databases for protein-coding genes and their products unravels a tremendous deficit of knowledge by indicating that function is unknown for more than 40% of all protein-coding genes  <cit> . these genes may code for unknown folds and novel enzymatic capabilities. however, if computational biology fails to identify function, an enormous battery of experiments have to be accomplished, due to the number of distinct enzymatic activities and other protein functions observed in nature; see e.g.  <cit> . therefore, all plausible hypotheses generated by clips-1d and similar methods are of value and help to reduce the number of experimental analyses.

one might expect that exploiting the 3d-structure of a protein contributes a lot to functional assignment. this is not necessarily the case: structure-based algorithms have failed to outperform msa-based approaches in predicting catalytic sites and have maximally reached the same mcc-value; see  <cit>  and references therein. however, if 3d-data and an msa are at hand, features deduced from structure and from homologous sequences can be utilized in a concerted manner. in addition to the above features, signals caused by correlated mutations  <cit>  can then be utilized to further characterize catalytic sites, which are surrounded by residues spanning a network of mutual information  <cit> . this is why we work on exploiting a combination of these features and the near future will show, whether this approach further improves classification quality. there is an urgent need for such methods: in mid  <dig>  no function has been attributed to more than 4% of the protein structures deposited in the protein data bank  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by analyzing an msa by means of clips-1d, residue-positions involved in catalysis can be identified with acceptable quality. in contrast, ligand-binding sites and residue-positions important for protein structure are hard to distinguish due to their similar patterns of conservation and residue propensities. our mc-svm can be applied to cases where the function of all homologs is unknown. the algorithm supports the user's decisions by computing a p-value for each prediction.
