BACKGROUND
multiple and diverse fungal secondary metabolites  are already in clinical usage, e.g. the antibiotic penicillin and the antitumor terrequinone a  <cit> . the inherent sm biosynthetic capacity of fungi remains largely unseen because the majority of these pathways are largely silent  under culture conditions used in the laboratory  <cit> . the presence of various sm backbone genes  in fungal genomes hints at the presence of an array of uncharacterised sms. for example, model fungal species aspergillus nidulans has sixty six predicted backbone genes  <cit> ; approximately one third of these clusters have been linked to the full range of produced sms, including monodictyphenone and prenyl xanthones  <cit> , asperfuranone  <cit> , emericellamides  <cit> , aspyridone a/b  <cit> , asperthecin  <cit> , terrequinone a  <cit> , aspernidine a  <cit> , sterigmatocystin  <cit> , penicillin  <cit> , nidulanin a  <cit> , microperfuranone  <cit> , cichorine  <cit> , orsellinic acid and f <dig> a/b  <cit> , austinol and dehydroaustinol  <cit>  and aspercryptin  <cit> .

closing the gap between genetic potential and the observed diversity of fungal sms produced constitutes a major challenge  <cit> , further complicated by low production titers and the need for specific stimuli to trigger synthesis  <cit> . several strategies have been described to stimulate production of particular sms; some require prior knowledge of genomic sequences, relying on manipulation of targeted genes encoding components of either secondary metabolism  <cit>   or regulatory pathways . other approaches may be applied also in less well characterised strains, such as co-cultivation methods  or modification of the growth media composition . we have surprisingly observed that supplementation of growth media with ionic liquids can significantly increase diversity of compounds in the metabolic footprint of penicillia  <cit> . ionic liquids comprise a diverse class of chemicals, composed solely by ions and are commonly classified as alternative green solvents   <cit> . they are also referred to as task-designed solvents, because their properties can be tuned through simple modification of the structure of either ion  <cit> . more than  <dig> different formulations are theoretically possible, with thousands already available commercially. recently we analysed the major cellular responses of a. nidulans to either cholinium chloride or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride exposure  <cit> . selected chemical stimuli are representative of the most studied families of ionic liquids and represent opposite ends of the spectrum regarding toxicity and recalcitrance. both compounds increase numerous mycelial stress-responsive proteins  and induce particular developmental changes and production of certain osmolytes  <cit> . extracellular compound diversity was apparently greater in a. nidulans grown in media supplemented with either ionic liquid than in control cultures. in summary the possibility of ionic liquids being able to activate cryptic sm biosynthetic pathways in fungi deserves further investigation. here we analyse how cholinium chloride and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride impact on both primary and secondary metabolism in a. nidulans. differential analyses of the fungal metabolome were combined with targeted gene expression analysis and transcriptional profiling . data highlight ionic liquid’s capacity to impact both on primary and secondary metabolism, stimulating sm biosynthesis . the diversity of differentially formed metabolites apparently comprised also unknown compounds with cell polarity modulation potential . this study sheds first light on the vast potential of ionic liquids to reveal the diversity of natural compound biosynthesis potential in fungi.

methods
chemicals
all standard chemicals , fusaric acid, 3--2-propenoic acid , propyl- <dig> ,5-trihydroxybenzoate, jasmonic acid, sterigmatocystin, penicillin g, physcion and riboflavin) and chromatographic solvents were of highest analytical grade and purchased from either sigma aldrich or fisher scientific, except ethyl acetate , orsellinic acid  and chrysophanol . water was obtained from a milli-q system . cholinium chloride , hereafter referred to solely as choline, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  were dried in vacuo  prior to use. monodictyphenone was kindly provided by prof. thomas j. simpson   <cit> .

fungal strain
aspergillus nidulans strain fgsc a <dig> was cultivated on dichloran-glycerol  agar , and suspensions of fungal conidia, prepared as previously described  <cit> , were stored at −80 °c in cryoprotective solution containing  <dig>  % w/v nacl and 10 % v/v glycerol.

culture condition
fungal cultures  were initiated from conidia  in a  <dig>  % glucose mineral growth media  <cit>  alone  or containing  <dig>  m cl or choline . liquid cultures  were incubated in the dark at 27 °c with orbital agitation , for defined periods of time . at the end of incubation, fungal mycelia  were recovered by filtration  and both mycelia and filtrate were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c, until further analysis.

microscopic analysis
mycelia were recovered from fungal cultures after fifteen days of incubation , mounted on glass slides and stained with lactophenol blue to enhance contrast. visualisation of cultures was performed using a dm <dig> b microscope  with 40× or 63× magnification objectives and images were captured with a dfc <dig> c camera .

rna isolation and cdna synthesis
total rna was isolated from mycelia  using the rneasy plant mini kit  and further purified following standard ethanol precipitation. quantity and quality of rna was determined using a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer  and rna integrity assessed by using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyser with a rna  <dig> nano assay . crna was fragmented and biotinylated according to genechip 3’ ivt express kit protocols. briefly, 100 ng total rna were used for cdna synthesis, which was in vitro transcribed to generate labelled crna. after purification and fragmentation, the size distribution of crna and fragmented crna was assessed using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer with an rna  <dig> nano assay.

dna microarray processing
the custom dna microarray fungianc  was used in this study  <cit> . the chip contains a total of  <dig>  transcripts derived from the genetic information of a. nidulans and neurospora crassa  and is based on a perfect match-only design with  <dig> μm feature size. each transcript is represented by  <dig> oligonucleotides of 25-mer . the array was processed following affymetrix genechip protocols, in biological triplicates. a total of 200 μl hybridization mixture containing 10 μg fragmented crna was hybridized to arrays for 16 h at 45 °c. standard post-hybridization washes and double-stain protocols  were used on an affymetrix genechip fluidics station  <dig>  in conjunction with the genechip hybridization wash and stain kit . arrays were scanned on an affymetrix genechip scanner  <dig> 7g. all array quality parameters were analysed by expression console software  for robust multiarray averaging  and confirmed to be in the recommended range. the data herein presented have been deposited in ncbi’s gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> .

microarray data analysis
microarray data analysis was performed using dna-chip analyzer  software , applying a probeset mask file considering only a. nidulans probes . arrays were normalised to a baseline array with median cel intensity by applying an invariant set normalization method  <cit> . normalised cel intensities of the  <dig> arrays were used to obtain model-based gene expression indices based on a perfect match-only model  <cit> . log <dig> expression data produced by dchip was imported into r v <dig> . <dig> and differential gene expression analysed with the bioconductor limma package   <cit> . principal component analysis and volcano plots were obtained to validate biological replicates and visualise distribution of statistically significant data from each biological condition . differentially expressed genes , identified using pair-wise comparison between each condition and control  , were analysed with venn diagrams  .

functional annotation
annotation of all genes represented on the dna microarray was obtained from the broad institute database and the aspergillus genome database . full details are given in additional file  <dig>  differentially expressed genes for each condition were classified using the fungifun web annotation tool   <cit> . significant hits  were defined using the identities present on the chip as background .

quantitative real-time pcr
all quantitative real-time pcr  oligonucleotide pairs – based on a. nidulans gene sequences  - were designed using the genefisher <dig> web tool  and produced by thermo fisher scientific . qrt-pcr analyses were performed in a cfx <dig> thermal cycler , using the ssofast evagreen supermix ,  <dig> nm of each oligonucleotide and cdna template equivalent to 1 ng total rna, in a final volume of 10 μl per well . pcr conditions were: enzyme activation at 95 °c for 30 s; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 10 s and annealing/extension at 59 °c for 30 s; and melting curve obtained from 65 °c to 95 °c, consisting of  <dig>  °c increments every 5 s. data analysis was performed using the cfx manager software v <dig>  . expression of each gene was calculated relative to control. expression of all target genes was normalised to the expression of the histone h <dig> gene, used as internal control.

metabolite extraction and analyses
lyophilised culture filtrates were homogenised in milli-q water and extracted three times with ethyl acetate , dried under soft nitrogen flow and resuspended in a minimal volume of methanol. preliminary mass spectrometry analyses of the extracts showed much higher abundance of differential m/z in negative mode compared to positive mode . for that reason, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-high resolution mass spectrometry  analyses of metabolite extracts were performed in negative mode using a q-exactive orbitrap ms system  equipped with a heated electrospray ionisation source   <cit> . chromatographic separation was carried out in an uhplc system  using an ascentix express c <dig>  column from supelco . the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 300 μl/min, consisted of a solution of  <dig>  % formic acid  and a solution of acetonitrile containing  <dig>  % formic acid , set as follows: 10 % b in 1 min, followed by a liner gradient of 10–95 % b in  <dig>  min,  <dig>  min to reach 100 % b, 3 min of 100 % b,  <dig>  min to return to the initial conditions, and  <dig>  min to re-equilibrate the column. hesi-ii was operated in negative ionisation mode. nitrogen was used as a sheath gas, sweep gas and auxiliary gas at flow rates of  <dig>   <dig> and 10 a.u. , respectively. heater temperature was set at 350 °c. capillary temperature was set at 320 °c and electrospray voltage at −  <dig>  kv. a s-lens rf level of 50 v was used. q-exactive orbitrap ms system was tuned and calibrated using thermofisher calibration solution once a week. the hrms instrument was operated in full ms scan with a m/z range from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the mass resolution tuned into  <dig>  full width half maximum  at m/z  <dig>  with an automatic gain control  target  of  <dig> e <dig> with a maximum injection time  of 200 ms. the full ms scan was followed by a data-dependent scan operated in all ion fragmentation  mode with a fragmentation energy applied of 30 ev into the high-energy collision dissociation  cell. at this stage, mass resolution was set at  <dig>  fwhm at m/z  <dig>  agc target at  <dig> e <dig>  maximum it at 200 ms, and the scan range also from m/z  <dig> to  <dig>  ms data were processed by exactfinder™ v <dig>  software  by applying a user target database list, comprising nearly one thousand four hundred sms previously described in ascomycota . parameters including retention time, accurate mass errors and isotopic pattern matches were used in preliminary manual compound identification. analytical standards of monodictyphenone, chrysophanol, orsellinic acid, toluhydroquinone, orcinol, epoxysuccinic acid, phenoxyacetic acid,  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoic acid , fusaric acid, 3--2-propenoic acid , propyl- <dig> ,5-trihydroxybenzoate, jasmonic acid, sterigmatocystin, physcion and riboflavin were used for compound identity validation, applying following criteria: Δrt ≤  <dig>  min and Δ ≤ 5 ppm. mycelial accumulation of betaine was quantified as previously reported  <cit> .

RESULTS
aspergillus nidulans differential metabolic footprints under ionic liquid stimuli
the diversity of compounds in the metabolic footprint of fungi depends on growth media composition   <cit> . simple, systematic compositional alterations allow discovery of multiple sms in a single producing organism  <cit> . this strategy, usually known as the “one strain-many compounds approach”, provides high flexibility for screening poorly characterised strains. adding sub-lethal concentrations of an ionic liquid to the growth media of penicillium spp.  <cit>  or a. nidulans  <cit>  augmented the diversity of compounds in the culture footprints. high resolution spectrometric analyses of a. nidulans metabolite extracts were performed to expand our initial findings. compared to control conditions ionic liquid stimuli altered the fungal metabolic footprint, increasing the diversity of metabolites . by applying a user target list of ascomycota sms, a list of differential ion masses  detected under an ionic liquid stimulus, when compared to the control, could be produced . there were ca.  <dig> differential ion masses detected in either ionic liquid medium when compared to the control, with  <dig> and  <dig> specific to choline or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride supplemented media, respectively .fig.  <dig> chromatographic analyses of the metabolic footprint of aspergillus nidulans under ionic liquid stimuli. the base peak intensity chromatograms of the culture extracts after fifteen days of incubation in either choline or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  supplemented media revealed higher diversity of metabolites when compared to the control



most ion masses matched compounds present in our user target list but only six compound identifications could be validated with standards . these included four known metabolites of aspergillus: orcinol  <cit> , phenoxyacetic acid  <cit> , orsellinic acid  <cit>  and monodictyphenone  <cit> , as well as gentisic acid and caffeic acid which, to the best of our knowledge, are reported here for the first time in a. nidulans. gentisic acid has previously been detected in penicillium griseofulvum  <cit> , whereas caffeic acid was reported only once in a fungal metabolite screening  <cit> . none of the remaining putative identifications could be validated with the corresponding standards, e.g. chrysophanol and sterigmatocystin. none of the ion masses identified here matched penicillin, confirming its absence.table  <dig> metabolites differentially produced under ionic liquid stimuli

uhplc-esi-hrms differential analyses of putative compounds  detected in the metabolite extracts of either choline or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  supplemented media, compared to the control. compound identifications were validated by the corresponding standards


aa compound reported equal m/z value but was not validated as orcinol;b vestigial amounts also found in the control; calso detected in early time-points: monodictyphenone was detected after  <dig> and 10 days of incubation in choline media; and orsellinic acid was detected after 5 days of incubation in choline media and after 10 days of incubation in cl media



among identified compounds we found two already characterised cryptic sms . monodictyphenone, exclusively found in choline supplemented media, and orsellinic acid, found with both ionic liquid supplements . monodictyphenone is a product of the monodictyphenone biosynthetic pathway in a. nidulans  <cit> , initially characterised in a Δccla strain   <cit> . orsellinic acid has been detected in a. nidulans during co-cultivation with streptomyces hygroscopicus  <cit>  and, more recently, also in sucrose supplemented media  <cit> . the production of the otherwise cryptic derivatives of the monodictyphenone cluster , and orsellinic acid, was stimulated in a. nidulans grown in continuous fermentation under nutrient limited conditions  <cit> .fig.  <dig> total ion chromatogram  of aspergillus nidulans metabolite extracts under ionic liquid stimuli. tic derived from fifteen day cultures in choline or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  supplemented media. extracted ion chromatograms  and respective hrms spectra for peaks corresponding to monodictyphenone and orsellinic acid are also presented



transcriptome profiling of a. nidulans during exposure to ionic liquids
to shed light on the impact of ionic liquids on the a. nidulans transcriptome, including genes encoding components involved in secondary metabolism – either biosynthesis or regulation – whole-genome profiling analysis   <cit>  was performed. raw signal intensities for all genes are given in additional file  <dig>  principal component analysis showed that the biological replicates of each condition were clustered together  and dissociated from the remaining clusters . volcano plots clearly show a great number of transcripts with highly significant differential expression . pair-wise comparison was used to identify genes expressed differentially between the control and cultures grown in ionic liquid media for fifteen days . in either ionic liquid media ca. 35 % of transcripts  showed altered expression levels, but only ca. 6 % were altered by both . choline supplementation led to up- and down-regulation of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, respectively. 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride supplement, up-regulated  <dig> transcripts and down-regulated  <dig> transcripts. according to the functional categories database of the munich information center for protein sequences , the differentially expressed genes were enriched in the categories metabolism , energy , transcription  and protein synthesis . in general, most of these functional categories were up-regulated in choline medium but down-regulated in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride medium . these findings match those of our previous proteomic profiling study  <cit> , which reflect the distinct biodegradability and toxicity of these ionic liquids.

ionic liquids impact on stress response and primary metabolism of a. nidulans
filamentous fungi respond to very diverse environmental stresses by activating different signalling transduction cascades . extracellular signals are usually sensed and transmitted to response regulators  <cit>  that also impact other processes, ranging from asexual development and cell wall integrity to fungicide sensitivity  <cit> . aspergillus nidulans can tolerate saline concentrations considerably higher than those used here  <cit> . both ionic liquids up-regulated the response regulator of the high osmolarity glycerol  pathway – sska  , but none of the downstream elements  nor any transcription factors regulated by this pathway   <cit> . in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride supplemented medium, sska up-regulation occurred together with genes coding for catalase a , glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase , neutral trehalase  and nadp-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase  , strongly suggesting the formation of stress-tolerant conidia  <cit> . in fact, conidia formation was observed in the floating mycelia at the surface of the liquid media in both cultivation conditions.table  <dig> genes of stress response differentially expressed after ionic liquid stimuli

microarray analyses  in choline or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  supplemented media in pair-wise comparisons with the control. values highlighted in bold are statistically significant 


*values highlighted in bold have |fc| ≥  <dig>  and p-value ≤  <dig>  in the microarray data



it has previously been suggested that 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride can induce autolysis in a. nidulans  <cit> , a process of self-digestion of aged hyphae  <cit> . proteome profiling showed the increase of two autolysis hallmark proteins, β- <dig> -endoglucanase  and chitinase b , during growth in ionic liquid supplemented media  <cit> . the corresponding transcripts were not found to be up-regulated here. up-regulation of an <dig>  and an <dig>  suggests autophagy was occurring . this process is related to nutrient recycling during starvation and has been shown to precede autolysis  <cit> . microscopic analysis showed that by incubation day fifteen, mycelia and hyphae of a. nidulans grown in choline supplemented medium were more robust than those grown in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride supplemented medium, which in turn were similar to the control culture . the formation of hülle cells was detected in the choline medium , as also seen in our previous study  <cit> . this is consistent with the observed up-regulation of the catalase d gene  , induced in these specialised cells during sexual development  <cit> .fig.  <dig> microscopic images of aspergillus nidulans mycelia under ionic liquid stimuli. images were collected at incubation day fifteen in the control medium or in either choline or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  supplemented media . in media supplemented with choline, formation of hülle cells could be observed  . scale bars:  <dig> μm ;  <dig> μm 



aspergillus nidulans is able to take up choline as a source of carbon and nitrogen  <cit> . in choline supplemented medium a great number of genes involved in the central carbon and amino acids metabolisms were up-regulated , suggesting activation of primary metabolism. choline can be phosphorylated and incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, a principal constituent of cellular membranes  <cit> . excess of phosphatidylcholine is counterbalanced by its degradation into for example  <dig> -diacylglycerol, as suggested by the up-regulation of the phospholipase c gene  . in our previous proteomic study  <cit> , we observed that choline was most likely taken up and metabolised via the glycine, serine and threonine metabolic pathway, and incorporated into the central carbon metabolism. the transcriptomic data reported here further confirm these observations. up-regulation of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase  and dimethylglycine oxidase  supports the hypothesis that choline enters the primary metabolism through formation of betaine aldehyde and betaine, which is further converted to glycine . the three-fold accumulation of betaine in the mycelia under choline supplementation when compared to the control  further supports this hypothesis. downstream steps indicate the formation of serine from glycine  and its conversion into pyruvate, as evidenced by the major up-regulation of the serine dehydratase gene , which reached almost 119-fold . as a consequence of this influx of carbohydrates, most genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid  cycle and glyoxylate shunt were up-regulated . some genes involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were also up-regulated , suggesting the incorporation of these carbon sources into other metabolic pathways. for example, the activation of the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway  is supported by the up-regulation of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase  and deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase . most metabolic pathways of amino acids were affected by choline supplementation, up-regulating genes involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine; aspartate, alanine and asparagine; branched and aromatic amino acids; glutamate, glutamine and proline, among others . excessive supplementation with choline induced accumulation of cyanase  <cit> ; consistent with the up-regulation of the encoding gene  observed here . since cyanide mineralisation is mediated by this enzyme  <cit> , the accumulation of this toxic compound may partially explain how excess choline may result in growth inhibition and activation of stress response in a. nidulans.fig.  <dig> main alterations in aspergillus nidulans primary metabolism and stress response under ionic liquid stimuli. schematic view of the main alterations in the primary metabolism  and stress response of aspergillus nidulans after fifteen days of incubation in the control medium or in either choline or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  supplemented media. many steps and compounds are omitted for simplification



major down-regulation on the primary metabolism of a. nidulans was provoked by 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, as previously suggested by our proteomic study  <cit> . genes involved in glycolysis and tca cycle were mostly down-regulated, probably a consequence of nutrient limitation . this is also strongly sustained by the down-regulation of the majority of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids. a few exceptions were observed, such as the up-regulation of genes involved in alanine, aspartate and asparagine metabolism, namely asparaginases , asparagine synthetase  and aspartate aminotransferase . this is suggestive of degradation of asparagine into aspartate, followed by incorporation into the central carbon metabolism via oxaloacetate. up-regulation of genes coding for glycogen debranching enzyme  and β-glucosidase , involved in the degradation of glycogen and glucans, respectively, points to the use of cellular reserves. the data suggest that carbohydrates originating from these reserves enter glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and are channelled to the pentose phosphate pathway . 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride induced also the up-regulation of genes involved in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, 6-phosphogluconolactonase , 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases  and ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase  . a similar effect was noticed before, although more evident in n. crassa than in a. nidulans  <cit> . activation of this pathway leads probably to higher nadph levels, which plays important roles in antioxidant defence  <cit> .

both ionic liquids apparently stimulated glutathione biosynthesis, known to play a key role in the stress response in filamentous fungi. this assumption is supported by the up-regulation of its biosynthetic genes, namely gamma-glutamyltranspeptidases genes  and gamma-cysteine synthetase regulatory subunit gene  . aspergillus nidulans up-accumulated a glutathione s-transferase in media supplemented with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride  <cit> . glutathione s-conjugates are probably formed in the presence of either ionic liquid, shown here by the up-regulation of genes encoding glutathione s-transferases  . accordingly, we also observed that genes coding for efflux pumps  belonging to the atp-binding cassette  superfamily and the major facilitator superfamily  were up-regulated . mfs multidrug transporters have been reported to participate in detoxification of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride in enterobacter lignolyticus  <cit> . activation of both conjugation reactions and efflux pumps is most likely involved in the ionic liquids’ detoxification processes in a. nidulans.

both ionic liquids have possibly triggered the production of acetyl-coa through pyruvate metabolism  or the degradation of amino acids, such as branched amino acids . apart from being channelled to central metabolic pathways, acetyl-coa is also a key precursor in the synthesis of numerous sms, e.g. elongation of polyketide chains  <cit> . also supporting production of sms, we observed here the up-regulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase gene  in either ionic liquid media. the encoded enzyme was not found in the mycelial proteome of a. nidulans cultures exposed to an ionic liquid, notwithstanding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase accumulated in n. crassa grown in similar conditions  <cit> . importantly, this enzyme mediates formation of the rare amino acid 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate found in bioactive sms classes such as neoefrapeptins and acretocins  <cit> .

ionic liquids impact on secondary metabolism of a. nidulans – backbone genes
genes involved in biosynthesis of a particular sm are usually clustered and comprise the backbone gene responsible for biosynthesis of the metabolite core structure and genes coding for additional tailoring enzymes  <cit> . the backbone gene alone can be responsible for the production of a specific sm , sometimes even when the expression of other clustered genes remains unaltered . overexpression of backbone genes can also result in high production titres of certain sms .

consistent with the greater diversity of putative compounds found in cultures exposed to either ionic liquid , in total twenty one of the sixty six predicted backbone genes  <cit>  were found up-regulated compared to the control . fifteen and nine backbone genes were found up-regulated in choline and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride supplemented media, respectively. this includes mdpg in the choline medium and orsa in both media. only three genes coincided between the two conditions, suggesting each ionic liquid induces a specific stimulus. in addition to mdpg, the monodictyphenone cluster includes mdpa  and mdpe , none of which underwent differential expression in choline media . these genes encode transcription factors required for full activation of the monodictyphenone cluster; their deletion usually decreases production titres of monodictyphenone, emodin and derivatives  <cit> . in addition, mdpc and mdpl were up-regulated, consistent with monodictyphenone formation. the microarray data support the ability of choline supplement to stimulate formation of monodictyphenone, probably due to up-regulation of mdpg, especially since ccla expression levels remained unaltered . de-repression of mdpg increased significantly over time in choline supplemented media compared to control , probably explaining monodictyphenone identification also on the fifth and tenth days of incubation .table  <dig> secondary metabolite synthase genes up-regulated upon ionic liquid stimuli

only orsa out of the three genes of the orsellinic acid cluster is necessary for the production of this metabolite  <cit> . orsellinic acid detection is consistent with up-regulation of orsa in both ionic liquid supplemented media , regardless of orsb and orsc expression values . orsa underwent major up-regulation during exposure to either ionic liquid, although its expression was transient . in the choline supplemented medium, the accumulation profile over time of orsellinic acid parallels orsa expression . in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride medium, despite orsa being more prominently up-regulated on the fifth day of incubation, this sm was detected only at longer incubation times . the activities of the histone acetyltransferases esaa   <cit>  and gcne   <cit>  were reported to activate expression of penicillin, terrequinone a and sterigmatocystin gene clusters, whereas gcne influences also orsa expression. none of the ionic liquids led to differential expression of esaa and gcne, or the backbone genes of penicillin, terrequinone a and sterigmatocystin . in agreement, penicillin and sterigmatocystin were confirmed to be absent in the culture media . putative identification of terrequinone a only occurred in control cultures , which may be explained by the major down-regulation of its backbone gene in both ionic liquid media . none of the identified ion masses matched compounds assigned to the remaining up-regulated backbone genes , probably because their abundance is below the detection limit or accumulated intracellularly, or other yet uncharacterised metabolites from the cluster were produced instead.

ionic liquids impact on secondary metabolism of a. nidulans – regulatory genes
a complex regulatory network governs the co-regulation of the clustered sm biosynthetic genes  <cit> , involving hierarchical levels of transcriptional regulatory elements. these can be either pathway-specific  or broad domain transcription factors , and proteins responsive to general environmental factors that are also implicated in cluster activation   <cit> . global regulators of secondary metabolism in aspergillus spp. include the well-studied velb/vea/laea transcriptional complex  that links secondary metabolism with fungal development  <cit> . in the dark – similar to culture conditions used here – the velvet complex controls the activity of laea , which in turn controls the expression of several sm gene clusters  <cit> . the impact of laea on the regulation of secondary metabolism has been well studied in a. fumigatus   <cit> , but is also known to impact other fungi . it controls, in general, gene clusters positioned at the telomere proximal region of the chromosomes  <cit> . among the backbone genes found up-regulated here only few are located proximal to the telomere, consistent with studies implicating other secondary metabolism regulatory elements apart from laea  <cit> .

laea  is required for biosynthesis of sterigmatocystin and penicillin  <cit> . however, sterigmatocystin biosynthesis can be restored in laea or vea deletion strains by the up-regulation of rsma   <cit>  or the deletion of mtfa   <cit> , respectively. our microarray data showed that both ionic liquids led to down-regulation of laea, whereas vea  was down-regulated only in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride supplemented medium and velb  was not differentially expressed in either condition . qrt-pcr analyses of expression levels of laea and vea over the incubation period  confirmed their down-regulation . in choline supplemented medium, despite the up-regulation of rsma over time  sterigmatocystin accumulation was not validated . in addition, up-regulation of mtfa in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride medium likely led to the down-regulation of sterigmatocystin and terrequinone a backbone genes , hence the absence of these sms in the cultures. penicillin accumulation in the culture was not observed, consistent with the down-regulation of laea, which is required for its biosynthesis  <cit> .table  <dig>

additional genes involved in histone modifications can also impact sm production. deletion of the histone deacetylase gene hdaa  for example induces the production of sterigmatocystin and penicillin  <cit>  and high levels of the heterochromatin protein hepa  provoke opposite effects  <cit> . hdaa was not differentially expressed but hepa was up-regulated in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride supplemented medium , probably contributing to the repression of sterigmatocystin and penicillin biosynthesis in this medium.

a set of thirteen genes involved in secondary metabolism, either coding for sm synthases , chromatin remodelling enzymes  or regulatory proteins, including those discussed above , as well as flug, were selected to validate the microarray data by qrt-pcr . with few exceptions the majority of the analysed genes displayed an expression profile similar to that detected by microarray analyses.

analysis of the biological activity of a. nidulans metabolite extracts after ionic liquid stimuli
to screen the presence of compounds displaying anti-carcinoma potential in the metabolite extracts of a. nidulans an ex vivo polarity modulation assay  was used. the positive control  affected 100 % of the drosophila eggs, whereas the blank  is devoid of any significant activity . the capacity of a pure compound to impair the fluorescent ring of the polarity marker protein par <dig> in more than ca. 50 % of the eggs is defined as the empirical cut off for a positive result. when dealing with complex mixtures, much weaker activities should be regarded as significant, especially if a de-replicated fraction shows substantially higher activity. under standard cultivation conditions , metabolite extracts  were virtually devoid of activity ; both ionic liquids induced the biosynthesis of compounds carrying anti-carcinoma potential. similar activities were, in general, measured for the metabolite extracts derived in either ionic liquid media at the seventh or the fifteenth day of incubation, which were much stronger that those measured at the second day . for example, crude metabolite extracts  from 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and choline supplemented media, at the seventh day of incubation, showed high to moderate activity ; their polar fractions  showed similar or much greater activity  . the detected activities cannot be related to any vestigial amounts of either ionic liquid, because these compounds per se lack activity . we verified also that 24 μg/ml of monodictyphenone  or orsellinic acid  affected  <dig> or 62 % of the eggs, respectively . both sms, primarily monodictyphenone, may contribute to the polarity modulating activity of the metabolite extracts ; additional active components probably remain obscured. the future challenge is to identify, among the compounds specific to each ionic liquid, those that carry intrinsic anti-carcinoma activity.fig.  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptional profiling was used for the first time to evaluate ionic liquids broad impacts on both primary and secondary metabolism of a. nidulans. primary metabolism was up-regulated by choline, but down-regulated by 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. choline could be used as a source of carbon and nitrogen probably via the glycine, serine and threonine metabolic pathway, and incorporated into the central carbon metabolism. on the contrary, the recalcitrant 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride induced the use of cellular reserves and autophagy. both ionic liquids induced detoxification mechanisms  probably to eliminate the toxic cations or toxic intermediates . despite strongly contrasting effects on primary metabolism either ionic liquid apparently stimulated production of acetyl-coa, a key precursor to numerous sms, as well as the production of non proteinogenic amino acids known as building blocks of bioactive classes of sms. differential analyses of the fungal metabolome allowed discovery of numerous putative sms, including gentisic acid and caffeic acid here reported for the first time in a. nidulans. concurrently with numerous differentially formed compounds, multiple genes encoding sm biosynthetic enzymes were up-regulated. each ionic liquid stimulus activated a specific set of backbone genes, including uncharacterised ones. in addition, growth media supplementation with choline led, for the first time, to monodictyphenone accumulation in a wild type strain of a. nidulans. importantly, we observed here that the complex mixtures of the formed metabolites camouflage compounds with anti-carcinoma potential. this study should inspire the search of novel bioactive fungal sms biosynthesised under an ionic liquid stimulus.

ionic liquids impact on eukaryotic organisms constitutes a fundamental cue for conscious development of this field. this study constitutes a step forward to prior proteomic analyses of ionic liquids’ impacts in primary metabolism, providing a more detailed analysis and expanding initial findings to secondary metabolism. we believe it illustrates the potential of ionic liquids to induce metabolic alterations and stress responses in eukaryotic organisms. in particular, we showed that they can be used to further resolve the diversity of natural compounds, guiding discovery of fungal metabolites with clinical potential. further studies are necessary to elucidate the capacity of the ionic components to specifically modulate defined response regulators of metabolism and development in fungi. ionic liquids formation during the confrontation between two ant species has been recently demonstrated, probably as a defence mechanism  <cit> . the likelihood of natural ionic liquids creates a new paradigm – they are not exclusively man-made chemicals – and supplies a new boost of interest in their research. unforeseen possibilities have been revealed and future exploration promises to be exciting.

authors’ information

this research constitutes an important milestone for c. silva pereira’s team  that is addressing a major scientific question: how fungi perceive and interact with the environment? what makes our research approach distinctive is the merger of fundamental biology research with chemical expertise. such a multidisciplinary environment has inspired the application of ionic liquids in biological sciences research. while initial studies focussed on their toxicity towards filamentous fungi, we are now exploring their function as unique stimuli to address knowledge gaps in secondary metabolism and signalling pathways, impacting on fungal pathogenicity and development. task-designed ionic liquids provided us with an entry point for use of suberin macromolecules - which self-assemble ex situ as biocidal films - to investigate how this plant polyester impacts on fungal development . we are particularly interested in using our acquired knowledge to develop novel and efficient antifungal strategies. the need for novel antifungals is massive and growing, emerging fungal pathogens are globally a major cause of mortality in the immunocompromised patient populations, and the current pace of antifungal drug development is simply too pedestrian to keep up.
