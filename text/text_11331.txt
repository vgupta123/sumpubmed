BACKGROUND
deinococcus radiodurans is an extreme bacterium known for its resistance to ionizing radiation , ultraviolet  radiation, oxidative stress, and desiccation  <cit> . it has been reported that d. radiodurans can recover from exposure to γ-radiation at  <dig> kgy, a dose lethal to most life forms. ir can directly damage biomacromolecules and can also produce reactive oxygen species  that can indirectly attack both proteins and dna  <cit> . therefore, cellular defense against ros-induced protein and dna damage is proposed to be important to the radiation resistance of d. radiodurans  <cit> .

manganese plays an important role in the antioxidant systems of bacteria and can relieve the phenotypic deficit of sod-null escherichia coli  <cit> . interestingly, daly and coworkers found that the mn/fe ratio of most ir-resistant bacteria is higher than that of ir-sensitive bacteria. the group also found that d. radiodurans grown in manganese-deficient medium was relatively more sensitive to ir than the bacteria grown in manganese-containing medium, suggesting that the accumulation of intracellular manganese ions can protect proteins from ros-induced damage and can help in the survival of d. radiodurans in extreme environments  <cit> .

although manganese can improve cellular ros resistance, excess manganese is toxic to cells. thus, maintenance of the intracellular mn concentration homoeostasis is a challenge. in bacteria, two main classes of manganese transporters have been identified--nramp h+-mn2+ transporters and the atp-binding cassette  mn2+ permeases  <cit> . recently, a manganese efflux system was identified in streptococcus pneumoniae, and this was found to play important roles in host pathogenesis and h2o <dig> resistance  <cit> . many genes involved in the maintenance of manganese ion homeostasis have been reported in d. radiodurans, such as dr <dig>  dr <dig>  <cit> , dr <dig>  <cit> , and dr <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it would be very interesting to determine whether d. radiodurans possesses a similar manganese efflux system.

in this study, we identified a manganese efflux gene  in d. radiodurans and demonstrated that it plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of intracellular mn. the null mutant mnte- was highly sensitive to manganese ions. when the intracellular level of manganese ions was increased by mutating dr <dig>  the mutant showed clearly enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. our results also demonstrated that increased intracellular mn levels could substantially suppress protein oxidation  in d. radiodurans exposed to h2o <dig>  indicating that manganese transport and regulation may be involved in the cellular resistance of d. radiodurans to oxidative stress.

RESULTS
d. radiodurans encodes a putative manganese efflux protein
by searching the d. radiodurans genome http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, we identified a manganese efflux protein homologue that was annotated as the conserved hypothetical protein dr <dig> based on its extensive sequence similarity  to the manganese efflux protein  of streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . similar to most cation diffusion facilitator  proteins, dr <dig> has six putative transmembrane domains  http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/tmpred_form.html. the most conserved region of the cdf protein is the tmd region, which is probably involved in metal transfer  <cit> . sequence alignment was performed with the clustal w program available on the embl web page http://www.ebi.ac.uk. the alignment sp <dig> and dr <dig> revealed the presence of highly conserved sequences in metal transfer regions iii and vi . moreover, the dxxxd motif, which is conserved in the manganese efflux protein, was also present in dr <dig> .

mnte is essential for the manganese resistance of d. radiodurans
to confirm the specific substrate and roles of dr <dig> in d. radiodurans, the null mutant of dr <dig>  and wild-type revertant mnte strains were constructed . metals including manganese are essential yet potentially toxic to bacteria  <cit> . supplementation with certain metal ions can inhibit the growth of an exporter system mutant  <cit> ; therefore, this phenotype is used to verify certain mutants. in this study, wild-type r <dig> and dr <dig>  were grown on tgy plates overlaid with discs saturated with  <dig> μl of different metal ion solutions  containing manganese, magnesium, cobalt, calcium, copper, zinc, nickel, or iron ions. as shown in figure 3a/b, the growth of the mnte- mutant was strongly inhibited by the manganese ions, but the mutant grew normally in the presence of other cations. moreover, the wild-type revertant showed a growth phenotype similar to that of r <dig>  indicating that growth inhibition of the mnte- mutant was due to the interruption of dr <dig> 

to further investigate the influence of manganese ions on the mnte- mutant, different concentrations of manganese ions were added to tgy medium, and the growth of the mnte- mutant was measured . the results showed that in comparison with r <dig>  the growth of the mnte- mutant was clearly delayed in the presence of low concentrations of manganese ions. when the manganese concentration increased, the growth defect phenotype became more pronounced. this phenotype is similar to that observed in rosch's study in which the growth of s. pneumoniae having a disrupted calcium efflux system was more severely inhibited at higher calcium concentrations  <cit> .

the mnte- mutant shows high intracellular manganese concentrations
to confirm that the mnte- mutant had lost its ability to export manganese ions, the intracellular manganese ion levels of wild-type r <dig> and the mnte- mutant were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry . as expected, when grown on tgy medium supplemented with manganese ions, the manganese ion level in the mnte- mutant was almost four-fold higher than that in wild-type r <dig>  however, there was no significant difference in the intracellular fe ion concentrations of r <dig> and the mutant . similar results were obtained when the mnte- mutant and wild-type r <dig> were grown on tgy medium . this result indicates that dr <dig> is a manganese ion exporter.

the mnte- mutant shows higher resistance to γ-radiation, uv, and oxidative
recently, there has been a debate on whether the high intracellular mn/fe ratio of d. radiodurans contributes to the extreme oxidative resistance of this microorganism. daly et al proposed that the high mn/fe ratio can effectively suppress protein carbonylation and increase radiation resistance  <cit> . in contrast, sukhi et al and shashidhar et al argued that d. radiodurans exhibits the same radiation resistance even when the intracellular mn/fe ratio changed substantially  <cit> . since the intracellular manganese ion level was significantly increased, a cell survival experiment was carried out to confirm whether the high intracellular manganese ion level could contribute to cellular resistance. the d <dig> value represents the irradiating dose required to reduce the population by 90%. here, the d <dig> value was proposed to assess the resistant ability of r <dig> and mnte- mutant to different stresses. as shown in figure  <dig> the resistance of the mnte- mutant under different stresses was higher than that of r <dig>  and the d <dig> values of the mnte- mutant were  <dig> gy γ-radiation,  <dig> j/m <dig> uv, and  <dig> mm h2o <dig>  whereas that for r <dig> was  <dig> gy γ-radiation,  <dig> j/m <dig> uv, and  <dig> mm h2o <dig>  moreover, when r <dig> and mnte- mutant were cultured in tgy supplemented with  <dig> μm manganese, their resistance to different stresses also increased remarkably, and it is consistent with their intracellular manganese level . the results suggest that there is a correlation between the intracellular manganese level and cellular oxidative resistance, which is consistent with the data from daly's studies  <cit> . although the role of manganese in the oxidative resistance of d. radiodurans remains unclear, our study implies that an increase in the intracellular manganese level may be one of the responses to oxidative stress. moreover, it is notable that the uv resistance of the mnte- mutant also increased. generally, uv light results in dna damage, and only high doses of uv cause oxidative damage. therefore, it is interesting to speculate that the uv resistance of the mnte- mutant may be indirectly enhanced by manganese ions. in fact, many important dna repair enzymes use mn2+ as the cofactor  <cit> , and manganese accumulation may have a positive effect on gene function. furthermore, a high intracellular manganese level is also known to have an important effect on the expression of many genes including stress response genes  <cit> .

the mnte- mutant shows a lower protein oxidation level under oxidative stress
the protein carbonylation level is an important index of intracellular oxidative damage to proteins  <cit> . previous reports have shown that the proteins of ir-sensitive bacteria are more vulnerable than those of d. radiodurans to ros-induced protein oxidative damage  <cit> . therefore, we measured and compared the levels of protein carbonylation in the mnte- mutant and wild-type r <dig>  notably, the level of protein carbonylation in the mnte- mutant decreased to nearly 50% of that in r <dig> after h2o <dig> treatment , indicating that the mutation of mnte resulted in a lower level of protein oxidation than that observed in the wild type. this suggests that the high level of intracellular manganese ions could enhance cellular resistance by protecting proteins against ros damage.

CONCLUSIONS
although it is known that the mn/fe ratio of d. radiodurans is higher than that of other bacteria, little is known regarding the maintenance of the intracellular manganese ion level in this bacterium. so far, only one manganese efflux system has been identified in bacteria  <cit> , and it is still unknown whether this system exists in d. radiodurans  <cit> . in this study, we identified a mnte homolog in d. radiodurans. as expected, our results showed that the intracellular manganese ion level was almost four-fold higher in the mutant than in r <dig>  furthermore, we also found that the oxidative level of mnte- proteins decreased to almost one half that of r <dig>  on the other hand, the data also revealed that manganese accumulation is dangerous to the mnte- mutant. based on these data, we conclude that dr <dig> is indeed a mnte homologue and is indispensable for maintaining manganese homeostasis in d. radiodurans. the results provide additional evidence that intracellular manganese ions are involved in the radiation resistance of d. radiodurans. however, because the intracellular mn/fe ratio and the mn concentration of mnte- both increased in this study, we could not clarify whether the mn/fe ratio or the mn concentration is more important for stress tolerance. therefore, global analysis of the regulation of the intracellular manganese ion level is necessary in further studies.
