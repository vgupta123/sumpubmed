BACKGROUND
the sex chromosomes in modern placental mammals  are highly dimorphic but initially evolved from a homologous pair of autosomes  <cit> . over millions of years of mammalian evolution, the sex chromosomes have lost most of their homology due to chromosome y attrition  <cit> . the remaining homology between the sex chromosomes exists in the pseudoautosomal regions , located at the ends of the x and y chromosomes  <cit>  and was generated when genetic material from the tips of autosomes translocated to the ancient sex chromosomes  <cit> . gene dosage between xx females and xy males is usually achieved by the silencing of one x chromosome in every female cell, a process known as x chromosome inactivation   <cit> . because both males and females have two copies of all par genes there is no requirement for dosage compensation and these genes therefore escape this inactivation process  <cit> .

comparison of human pars with those of other primates, carnivores  and artiodactyls  has revealed that gene content is mostly conserved in eutherians, including the existence of pars at both ends of the x and y chromosomes  <cit> . however, rodents are strikingly different in that they have a single, dissimilar and considerably shorter par region  <cit> . fewer than half of the  <dig> par <dig> genes identified so far in humans have also been found in the mouse genome, and all have diverged considerably  <cit> . this divergence is largely due to the increased recombination rates in the pars during male meiosis  <cit> . in addition, the pars comprise a unique chromosomal environment that is rich in repetitive sequences  <cit> . for these reasons, the identification of human par genes and orthologs has been difficult. interestingly, in the mouse, all human par <dig> orthologs identified to date are located on autosomes. for example, colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor, alpha  is located on mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig> antigen  and dehydrogenase/reductase short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, x chromosome  are located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . human orthologs of acetylserotonin o-methyltransferase-like  and several members of the arylsulfatase  family of genes  located just outside the par <dig>  have not yet been reported in the mouse . due to their location in the par region of evolutionary ancestors, and their current autosomal location, we will refer to these genes in the mouse as "ancestral par genes".

the α thalassemia mental retardation, x linked  protein, transcribed from xq <dig>  belongs to the sucrose non-fermenting  <dig>  family of enzymes that use the energy of adenosine tri-phosphate  hydrolysis to disrupt nucleosome stability  <cit> . mutations in atrx result in moderate to profound cognitive deficits, facial dysmorphisms, as well as skeletal and urogenital abnormalities, among other symptoms  <cit> . the chromatin remodeling properties of atrx have been demonstrated in vitro  <cit> . in addition to a conserved atpase/helicase domain, atrx has an n-terminal zinc finger atrx-dnmt3a/b-dnmt3l  domain that is shared with de novo methyltransferases. several lines of evidence have also linked atrx to highly repetitive genomic regions including pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse and human cells  <cit> . moreover, atrx mutations in humans result in aberrant dna methylation patterns at several repetitive elements, including ribosomal dna  repeats, subtelomeric repeats and y-specific satellite repeats  <cit> . these repetitive sequences usually form heterochromatic structures and seem to be specifically targeted by the atrx protein.

to assess the role of atrx in brain development, we previously used cre-loxp recombination to remove atrx specifically in the forebrain beginning at e <dig> . loss of atrx in the embryonic forebrain caused hypocellularity and a reduction in forebrain size and loss of the dentate gyrus  <cit> .

genes that are directly regulated by the atrx protein have not yet been identified in either humans or mice. to identify potential genes that are controlled by atrx, we performed a screen of gene expression and found that a subset of ancestral par <dig> genes is consistently downregulated in the absence of atrx in the developing mouse brain. among them are two potentially novel mouse orthologs of arse and asmtl. the only common link between ancestral par genes is their adjacent location and shared chromatin environment in the ancestral par region. we propose that conserved sequences and/or chromatin features targeted by atrx were maintained upon translocation of these genes from the par <dig> on the ancestral x chromosome to their current location on mouse autosomes, and allow atrx to modulate their expression.

RESULTS
effects of atrx deletion on forebrain gene expression
the ability of atrx to remodel chromatin  <cit>  suggests that atrx can regulate gene expression. to identify possible gene targets of the atrx protein in the developing mouse brain, we used the previously described atrxfoxg1cre mice that lack atrx in the forebrain  <cit> . in this model system, atrx deletion is achieved by crossing atrxloxp "floxed" mice to mice that express cyclization recombinase  under the control of the forebrain-specific forkhead box g <dig>  promoter  <cit> . we performed microarray analysis to compare the expression profiles of the atrxfoxg1cre and control telencephalon at embryonic day  <dig>    using an affymetrix mouse genome expression array representing approximately  <dig>  transcripts  <cit> . only probe sets showing a significant difference  were included in all subsequent studies. by setting a threshold of  <dig>  fold change we identified  <dig> disregulated probesets, and at a threshold of  <dig> fold change we identified only  <dig> altered probe sets. approximately two-thirds of the probe sets demonstrating altered expression were upregulated .

we next compared gene expression patterns in control and atrx-null forebrain tissue at postnatal day  <dig>   . at a threshold of  <dig>  fold change, we identified  <dig> probe sets and at a threshold of  <dig> fold change, we identified  <dig> probe sets showing altered transcript levels. when we compared the microarray results at e <dig>  and p <dig>  we identified  <dig> common probe sets that were upregulated and  <dig> that were downregulated more than  <dig>  fold, and one increased and three decreased more than  <dig> fold .

we used genespring to identify significantly overrepresented gene ontology  categories in the atrx-null mouse forebrain. several statistically and biologically significant categories of upregulated genes were related to the immune response. this could be an indirect response to the increased apoptosis that characterizes the atrx-null forebrain at e <dig>  in the developing cortex and to a lesser extent at p <dig>  in the hippocampus  <cit> . in particular, categories and genes involved in phagocytotic clearing of apoptotic cells, such as complement activation  <cit> , were enriched at both e <dig>  and p <dig> . several genes involved in cell adhesion processes were upregulated at p <dig>  and, consistent with the abnormal forebrain development described in the atrx-null forebrain <cit> , genes involved in neurogenesis and nervous system development were downregulated at both timepoints .

ancestral pseudoautosomal genes are downregulated in the atrx-null mouse forebrain
five of the most downregulated transcripts identified in the microarray analysis were unidentified cdna clones . to further investigate these probe sets, their ncbi nucleotide sequences were used for a basic local alignment search tool nucleotide  search of the nr database. the expressed sequence tag   has similarity to mus musculus dhrsxy . the est  displayed similarity to several unidentified mouse cdna clones. interestingly, a blast-like alignment tool  search of this clone showed similarity to intron  <dig> of mouse dhrsxy and it could represent an unknown splice variant of dhrsxy. the est  is annotated as similar to human arse and a blastn search revealed high similarity to rattus norvegicus arse . blastn of  showed high similarity to asmtl in cow  as well as dog, human, the putative rat asmtl, and numerous other species. the est  displayed no significant hits to any sequences by either blastn or blat. interestingly, while dhrsxy, arse and asmtl do not display an obvious connection, they do share a common link in that they are all pseudoautosomal genes in eutherians. in addition, the microarray data showed decreased expression of cd <dig>  shox <dig> and csf2ra, that also lie within the pseudoautosomal region in most eutherians. therefore, while go analysis identified a subset of downregulated genes involved in brain development at both timepoints, a more in depth analysis of downregulated targets revealed that many are orthologs of par <dig> genes residing on the tip of the x and y chromosomes in most placental mammals. overall, our transcriptional screen identified six of these genes, constituting approximately half of all par <dig> orthologs discovered in the mouse genome so far. the more intriguing aspect of this finding is that in the mouse, these genes no longer reside within the par <dig> region but have translocated to autosomes . it also identified two potential novel par <dig> orthologs–arse and asmtl–not previously identified in the mouse genome. at e <dig> , these genes represent  <dig> of the  <dig> most downregulated transcripts identified by microarray analysis. strikingly, they constitute  <dig> of the top  <dig> most downregulated genes in the microarray performed on p <dig>  forebrain tissue  . these results suggest that atrx normally participates in the transcriptional activation of these genes during both the proliferative  and more differentiative  stages of forebrain development.

crna was generated from total forebrain rna from three pairs of littermate-matched atrx-null and wild type forebrain tissue and hybridized to an affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array. data was analyzed using genespring. probesets were filtered by fold change  and confidence, p <  <dig> , and duplicate genes were removed. ancestral par genes are highlighted in grey.

verification of gene expression changes
to validate the microarray results, we performed real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  analysis of dhrsxy, cd <dig>  csf2ra, shox <dig> and also the putative new orthologs of asmtl and arse in atrx-null and control e <dig>  and p <dig>  forebrain . since arse and asmtl have not yet been identified in the mouse, we sequenced the pcr products to ensure they corresponded to the transcripts identified on the microarray, and not to other contaminating sequences. the qrt-pcr results confirmed that five of the six genes exhibit decreased expression in the atrx-null forebrain at e <dig> , and that these genes remain downregulated at p <dig>  . in addition, analysis at p <dig> demonstrated decreased expression of ancestral par genes at this later time point as well . one exception was shox <dig> which exhibited highly variable expression differences between the atrx-null and control tissue at e <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig>  ranging from a  <dig> fold decrease to a  <dig> fold increase . therefore, while the expression of shox <dig> is clearly affected by the loss of atrx protein, the outcome on expression levels appears to be highly variable and does not validate the consistent downregulation observed by microarray analysis.

our discovery that the expression of several ancestral par <dig> genes is controlled by atrx throughout the early developmental period of the mouse brain reveals an unexpected association between the levels of atrx protein and the expression of these ancestral par <dig> genes.

identification of a novel ars family mouse homolog
in humans, a cluster of ars genes are located approximately  <dig> kilobases centromeric to the par <dig> region on the x chromosome, but still possess the ability to escape xci in females  <cit> . located outside the par <dig>  these genes do not have an identical homolog on the y chromosome but have pseudogenes, and in the evolutionary past it is believed that they were true pseudoautosomal genes with identical copies on both the x and y chromosome  <cit> .

a multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of  suggested that it is a fragment of the full length arse protein, aligning in the middle of the approximately  <dig> amino acid arse protein of multiple other species . the putative mouse arse is 65% identical to rat and 47% identical to human.

phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the mouse arse sequence clusters with near certainty with the rat arse, however, this putative arse clustered within the arsd proteins, not arse as expected . therefore, we propose that we have identified a member of the par <dig> ars family but at this time cannot determine the exact identity and will refer to this sequence as arsd/e. we note that the long branch-length between the rodent ars sequences and the remaining arsd clade may be an artifact due to the short mouse sequence and its high similarity to the rat sequence, which has undergone seemingly accelerated evolutionary change.

comparisons to available mouse ars gene family members shows that  is more similar to arse genes in rat than to other mouse arylsulfatase family members , suggesting that we have identified arse. this data, combined with our ability to specifically amplify this transcript from mouse brain cdna and also from a commercially available e <dig> cdna library , indicates that we have likely identified the mouse homologue of a previously unidentified mouse ars gene rather then a gene fragment from a known mouse family member.

to further confirm the identity of , we assessed the outcome of atrx depletion on arsd/e expression by rna interference in the neuro-2a cultured neuroblastoma cell line. small interfering rnas  were used to transiently deplete atrx, as was done previously  <cit> . cells transfected with a non-specific sirna or no sirna  were used as controls. at  <dig> hours following sirna transfection, we monitored the effectiveness of atrx depletion by indirect immunofluorescence using an atrx-specific antibody  and qrt-pcr analysis of atrx expression levels using primers that simultaneously amplify both the full length isoform and the reported truncated isoform  <cit> . in the siatrx-treated samples, approximately 95% of cells were negative for atrx  and atrx transcript levels were depleted by approximately  <dig> fold . we then used qrt-pcr to determine the outcome of atrx silencing on the expression level of the arsd/e. similar to the results obtained in the atrx-null forebrain, the expression of arsd/e was decreased two fold . these findings support that we have identified the mouse arsd/e and confirm the regulation of this ancestral par gene by atrx, and that this outcome on gene expression can be recapitulated in two different systems: in vivo in the atrx-null developing forebrain and in vitro in atrx-depleted cultured neuronal cells.

identification of an asmtl-like gene
 is the riken cdna 1810009n <dig> gene and contains a musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma  domain. a multiple sequence alignment of amino acid sequences was used to further determine the identity of  .  aligns to the n terminus of asmtl from multiple other species. the n terminal portion of asmtl also contains a maf domain. human asmtl was generated by a fusion of a duplicated acetylserotonin o-methyltransferase  with the bacterial maf gene  <cit> . while  contains a maf domain, it lacks the asmt domain. however, this is similar to the putative rat asmtl  which also lacks the asmt domain. the putative mouse asmtl is 54% identical to rat, and 51% identical to the human protein.

in contrast to arse, asmtl has fewer discernable high-similarity full-length orthologs, and its evolution appears tied to the pseudoautosomal region  <cit> . therefore fewer sequences were available for analysis. figure  <dig> shows the inferred phylogeny of the asmtl family, with the primate branches collapsed for clarity. with fairly high bootstrap support, the tree mirrors the known branching of the placental mammals, marsupials, monotremes, birds, amphibians, and fish. the mouse sequence displays the only anomalous placement in the tree, clustering well outside the mammalian clade. both the placement and the branch-length of the mouse sequence indicate that it is of considerably evolutionarily derived character compared to the putative ancestor, and it appears to have followed an evolutionary path quite different from its paralogs. the lack of the asmt domain in the mouse sequence may also be responsible for the placement of the mouse sequence in the tree. as with arse, some of this divergence may be due to the availability of a partial mouse sequence, but the sequence remains quite unique, nonetheless.

discussion
mutations in the atrx gene result in profound cognitive deficits, facial dysmorphisms, as well as skeletal and urogenital abnormalities  <cit> . global deletion of atrx in mouse embryonic stem cells results in a growth disadvantage  <cit> , and conditional loss of atrx beginning at the 8– <dig> cell stage leads to embryonic lethality by e <dig>   <cit> . to bypass early embryonic lethality, we have previously used a conditional approach to delete atrx in the mouse forebrain beginning at e <dig> . these mice have significantly increased cortical progenitor cell apoptosis, causing a reduction in forebrain size and hypocellularity in the neocortex and hippocampus  <cit> . atrx is a chromatin remodeling protein  <cit>  and has been proposed to regulate gene expression by modulating chromatin structure, but gene targets of atrx have not yet been reported. we used a microarray approach to perform large-scale analysis of gene expression changes in the atrx-null versus wild type mouse forebrain at e <dig>  and p <dig> . the fact that relatively few genes display altered expression indicates that atrx is not a global regulator of gene expression but likely controls specific gene loci. it is not clear at this point if atrx acts by binding directly to dna or through other unidentified factors to upregulate the ancestral par genes identified in our study. the only target of atrx identified to date is α globin which is downregulated in patients with germline or somatic atrx mutations  <cit> , including α-thalassemia myelodysplastic syndrome  <cit> , although evidence that atrx directly binds to the α globin locus is still lacking.

through global transcriptional profiling we have now identified a distinct group of genes, the ancestral par genes, that are controlled by atrx in the mouse brain. the human par <dig> contains  <dig> genes, but only  <dig> of these have been reported in the mouse genome. arsd/e, asmtl, cd <dig>  csf2ra, dhrsxy and shox <dig> were among the most downregulated genes identified in the atrx-null embryonic forebrain. although these genes are unrelated in function, they share a common ancestral location in the par <dig> of the x chromosome millions of years ago. our findings demonstrate that they have maintained a mechanism of co-regulation that was conserved in evolution and that requires atrx, even after their dispersal to autosomes in the mouse genome.

the par <dig> region exhibits recombination rates approximately  <dig> times higher than the rest of the human genome  <cit> . consequently, genes in this region undergo rapid evolution leading to high interspecies divergence  <cit>  making positive identification of homologs difficult. using multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis we have identified arsd/e and asmtl as putative novel mouse ancestral par transcripts. identity between mouse and human sequences are 47%, 40% and 51% for arse , arsd  and asmtl , respectively, which is similar to what was reported for other par <dig> genes. for example, dhrsxy exhibits 59% protein identity between humans and mice  <cit> , cd <dig> 46% identity  <cit> , and 35% for csf2ra  <cit> .

arsd and arse are members of the arylsulfatase gene family and are located just outside the human par <dig> in a cluster of four arylsulfatase genes  <cit> . arse gene mutations cause x-linked chondrodysplasia punctata, a disorder characterized by abnormalities in cartilage and bone development  <cit> . arse may therefore play a role in the skeletal defects seen in patients with the atr-x syndrome if it is also regulated by atrx in humans. the role of arsd is unknown and it has no demonstrated sulfatase activity despite its high conservation of the n-terminal domain important for catalytic sulfatase activity  <cit> . arse exhibits a restricted pattern of expression  <cit>  while arsd is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> .

the function of human asmtl is unknown. the gene was generated by the duplication of the par <dig> gene asmt which then fused with the bacterial orfe/maf gene  <cit> . while other asmt genes involved in the serotonin/n-acetylserotonin/melatonin pathway are expressed specifically in the human brain, pineal gland and retina  <cit> , asmtl has a wider expression pattern and may not be involved in this pathway but could still have methyltransferase activity since it retains the necessary domain  <cit> .

we have also identified the mouse shox <dig> gene as a potential target of atrx, and we observed that shox <dig> expression levels are highly sensitive to atrx deficiency in the developing mouse brain. two shox genes, shox and shox <dig> have been identified in the human genome, on chromosomes x and  <dig>  respectively. only one mouse homolog has been identified and is mapped to chromosome  <dig>  like arse, shox genes are involved in skeletal development: mutations and deletions in shox lead to leri-weill dyschondrosteosis  <cit>  and non-syndromic idiopathic short stature  <cit> , and deletions cause the short stature phenotype seen in turner syndrome  <cit> . shox <dig> is involved in craniofacial and limb development  <cit>  and shox <dig> mutations lead to cleft palate  <cit> . along with arse, the shox genes provide an intriguing correlation with the skeletal phenotype of atr-x patients, and future work should address whether these genes are regulated by atrx in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our findings suggest that even though they are now located on different chromosomes, a large subset of ancestral par genes might share a common sequence or factor that was conserved upon translocation from the pseudoautosomal region on the x chromosome to their current autosomal locations in the mouse genome . uniform regulation of gene expression may be due to similar regulatory features such as common sequences or epigenetic modifications . despite the sequencing of the human x chromosome, gaps remain, most notably in the par <dig> region  <cit> . the repetitive nature of the pars likely explains the paucity of sequence data for these regions, and the lack of genomic sequence data for the par <dig> genes that have translocated to autosomes in the mouse. however, we speculate that atrx could be targeted to repetitive sequences surrounding these genes. one indication that atrx would preferentially target repetitive sequences comes from studies done in human atr-x syndrome patients. the analysis of blood samples revealed altered dna methylation of several highly repeated sequences including ribosomal dna arrays, the y-specific repeat dyz <dig> and subtelomeric repeats  <cit> . conservation of repetitive elements in the par <dig> region of eutherians may have been maintained with the par <dig> genes as they moved to autosomes, and perhaps allow atrx to target these genes in their modern chromosomal locations.

future work should focus on identifying the molecular mechanisms by which atrx can co-regulate this diverse set of genes linked by their ancestral localization in the par <dig> region. this will lead to a better understanding of atrx function in the regulation of chromatin structure and its effects on gene expression in general.
