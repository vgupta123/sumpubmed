BACKGROUND
non-human primates  are becoming increasingly valuable model species for biomedical research. nhps share a greater degree of conservation with humans, compared to other animal models, across every level of biology from genome sequence and structure through physiology to behavior  <cit> . at the same time, investigations of nhps can incorporate procedures and interventions that are infeasible in human research participants, as well as control of environmental exposures, such as diet. until very recently, however, the lack of nhp genetic and genomic resources has limited the utility of these models; in particular, progress in the field requires high-resolution genome-wide information on genetic variation comparable to that available in humans as well as large phenotyped study samples for linkage or association analyses.

as we describe here, genomic resources are now available in the vervet monkey that will enable genetic investigation of medically relevant traits, in phenotyped samples from highly abundant caribbean-origin vervet populations. one such population is the vervet research colony , an nih-supported research resource founded in the 1970s and 1980s from  <dig> wild caught monkeys from the caribbean islands of st. kitts and nevis  <cit> , which has included more than  <dig>  members  in a nine-generation deep extended pedigree. we had previously reported on the construction of a genetic linkage map of the vervet using a sparse set of short tandem repeat  markers  <cit>  genotyped in a portion of the vrc pedigree. this initial genetic map enabled the provisional genetic mapping of several quantitative traits in this richly phenotyped pedigree . snps identified in candidate linkage regions bolstered the evidence provided by the strs; however, large gaps in the str map rendered substantial portions of the vervet genome inaccessible to genetic analyses, and we lacked the high-resolution sets of polymorphisms needed to conduct genome-wide association studies  or to systematically fine-map linkage regions to discern potentially causal variations. this insufficiency motivated the generation of the vervet reference genome assembly, constructed using a vrc monkey, which now displays a degree of sequence contiguity that, among sequenced primates, is second only to that of humans . the availability of the vervet reference assembly enabled the efforts described here to generate genome-wide vervet snp sets for genetic investigations of the vrc caribbean-origin vervet samples.

commercially available arrays have provided an extremely inexpensive platform for genotyping genome-wide snps in humans and in a few model systems . the insufficient market for such arrays in nhps has necessitated the development of an alternative approach for inexpensively genotyping the vervet and other nhp models. pasaniuc and colleagues have demonstrated that low-pass whole genome sequencing  provides a cost-effective alternative to snp genotyping arrays for gwass  <cit> . we reasoned that a similar strategy could be employed in the vervet. while pasaniuc et al. used the extensive reference data available from human populations to determine genotypes, we planned to leverage the information available from the vrc pedigree structure to enable accurate assignment of genotypes. we describe here the use of a hierarchical sequence coverage strategy: deep sequence in  <dig> vrc monkeys to infer wgs-based genotype calling in more than  <dig> additional descendant vrc monkeys sequenced at a lower depth. we then indicate how, from these genotypes, we developed genome-wide panels of common vervet snps that will be useful for both linkage and association analyses of medically relevant traits.

RESULTS
the generation of common snps for linkage and association studies in the vrc started from a preliminary study, in which we systematically assessed the impact of coverage depth on genotyping accuracy depending on position in the pedigree, using sequence data from  <dig> monkeys. we used these data in a down-sampling experiment to inform our selection of coverage depth for sequence analysis of  <dig> additional monkeys. we then followed four main stages of analysis in the entire set of  <dig> monkeys: 1) identifying unequivocal segregating sites for common variants in  <dig> monkeys sequenced at high depth; 2) calling genotypes pedigree-wide at the snps identified in stage  <dig> in all  <dig> monkeys; 3) performing sample-level quality control  using snps called in stage 2; 4) establishing snp sets for genetic analyses by thinning the common snps from stage  <dig>  in monkeys that passed qc in stage  <dig>  we describe the results for each of these stages, indicating the number of snps that we removed, in each stage, by applying a series of qc filters.

down-sampling analysis showed that sequencing both parents at 4×  resulted in a much lower rate of mendelian inconsistencies and a higher degree of genotype concordance with non down-sampled genotypes  than a strategy in which both parents are sequenced at 1x and their offspring at 4× . importantly, the intermediate strategy  has a similar mendelian inconsistency rate and genotype concordance  to the strategy in which both parents in the trio are sequenced at 4×, suggesting the possibility of achieving further gains in cost effective recovery of genotypes. we also observed, in genotype analysis of the initial  <dig> monkeys that lowering the sequencing coverage of any single monkey has very little impact on the accuracy of genotyping of pedigree members beyond the trios of which s/he is a member .fig.  <dig> using the variant data from the wgs of the trio shown on the left, we evaluated three different down-sampling schemes, drawn on the right, to determine a pedigree-wide strategy for selecting monkeys for medium  or low  sequencing coverage. a the frequency of mendelian errors in a trio increases in all three down-sampling experiments compared to the original data; however, the increase in error rate is greatest when both parents are low coverage and the child is medium coverage. b the percentage of concordant genotype calls between original data and down-sampled data is lowest when both parents are low coverage and the child is medium coverage. the percentages shown for both the rate of mendelian inconsistency and for genotype concordance represent averages over three down-sampling experiments



considering the results of the down-sampling analysis, we used a greedy algorithm  to rank the pedigree members based on the number of their direct descendants included in the set of  <dig> monkeys that comprised the wgs sample, and employed this ranking as the primary rationale for including them in either high coverage , medium coverage , or low coverage  sequencing bins. based on this algorithm  we assigned  <dig> monkeys to high coverage,  <dig> to medium coverage, and  <dig> to low coverage wgs.

given improvements in technology over the course of the project, our sequencing protocol resulted, for a substantial proportion of samples, in considerably deeper coverage than had been our target . as a result, the variation in sequencing depth, across the pedigree, is more accurately represented as a continuum than as three discrete bins . for example, among the  <dig> monkeys targeted for 4–6× sequencing we achieved >20× average depth for  <dig> monkeys; 10–20× depth for  <dig> monkeys; and 6–10× depth for  <dig> monkeys. we considered “high coverage” monkeys to be a set of  <dig> monkeys, each with >25× average coverage, including the  <dig> monkeys initially chosen for high-depth sequencing and an additional monkey sequenced at a higher depth than originally planned.fig.  <dig> boxplot of actual sequencing depth versus planned sequencing depth for the  <dig> monkeys in the wgs study



in stage  <dig> we discovered  <dig> , <dig> snps in the  <dig> high coverage monkeys, and removed  <dig> , <dig> snps from further investigation based on different qc-associated metrics, with low polymorphism content  in these  <dig> monkeys being the largest factor, leading to the removal of about 6m snps . for the  <dig> , <dig> snps that passed through the stage  <dig> filters, we called genotypes in all  <dig> sequenced monkeys . in stage  <dig> we retained all snps that had a maf ≥  <dig> %  and performed a series of qc steps  that left us with  <dig> , <dig> high-quality common autosomal snps for construction of genome-wide association and linkage panels.table  <dig> filtering and qc procedures in stage 1: identifying unequivocal segregating sites. stage  <dig> started with  <dig> , <dig> sites and after qc ended with  <dig> , <dig> sites



in stage  <dig> we used snps that passed through stage  <dig> to perform sample-level qc and to refine the pedigree structure. based on discrepancies between known pedigree relationships and identity by descent  estimated from linkage disequilibrium -pruned snps, and on concordance between wgs data and a set of snp genotypes generated for another study with independent methods  <cit> , we excluded data for three monkeys that we strongly suspected represented contamination or mislabeling of dna samples. the information from pairwise ibd relationships  also enabled us to identify the parents for all but one of the  <dig> sequenced monkeys whose parentage had previously been unknown. we excluded from further analyses the single monkey for which we could not identify parents, leaving  <dig> monkeys for analysis in stage  <dig> 

in stage  <dig> we then obtained final snp sets for association and linkage analysis by thinning the final pedigree-wide common snp set generated in stage  <dig>  removing variants  with redundant genetic information . we conducted the steps in stage  <dig> to provide the community conducting vervet research in the vrc with well-vetted sets of polymorphisms that will facilitate their performance of genetic analyses; it is not our intent to utilize these sets to construct vervet-specific genotyping arrays. by ld pruning at r <dig> <  <dig>  we obtained a set of almost  <dig>  snps suitable for genome-wide association analysis, and by ld pruning at r <dig> <  <dig>  obtained a less dense set of almost  <dig>  snps suitable for linkage analysis. we then finalized these snp sets by removing snps for which pedigree-wide checks revealed mendelian inconsistencies . both snp sets  include predominantly highly polymorphic snps  that are densely placed across the genome .table  <dig> characteristics of the two mapping sets of markers derived in stage 4

to further facilitate linkage analyses of the vrc pedigree we used  <dig>  snps, ld-pruned from the 150k snp set, to construct multipoint identity by descent  files. we estimated a genetic map for these snps by interpolating from the  <dig> autosomal strs  that constituted the vervet str genetic map  <cit> , deriving the physical position of these strs from the vervet reference assembly. we then estimated the probability of ibd between all pairs of vervets, including monkeys without sequence data , at 1-cm intervals through the genome, for a total of  <dig>  estimates for each pair of monkeys. the mibd estimates are available upon request.

discussion
the completion of the wgs of  <dig> vrc monkeys and the generation of the snp sets reported here will enable genome-wide genetic analyses of numerous quantitative traits already assessed in this pedigreed colony.

the development of this sequencing-based resource will almost certainly be followed in the very near future by similar mapping tools in large pedigrees in other nhp species, including rhesus macaques  <cit>  and baboons  <cit> . as many of the traits assayed in the vrc are also available in these pedigrees, high-resolution comparative analyses to elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships may soon be feasible.

unlike the pedigrees sequenced in other nhp species, the vrc derives from a clearly demarcated and homogeneous ancestral population, that of the more than  <dig>  feral vervets resident on st. kitts and nevis  <cit> . because the monkeys used to found the vrc were trapped from numerous sites across these small islands, it is hypothesized that the vrc variant catalogue incorporates most of the genetic variation represented in the island populations. this expectation is particularly applicable to the snp sets, given the initial prerequisite that snps included in these sets displayed a maf of >  <dig> % in the  <dig> high coverage monkeys. as dna samples, biomaterials, and phenotype data are already available for nearly  <dig> island monkeys, and collections there are ongoing, it may soon be possible to conduct gwass or fine-mapping association studies in these population samples by analyzing the snps identified in the vrc  <cit> . because the samples available from the island vervet populations are more independent from one another than the vrc samples sequenced to date, it will be possible to more accurately delineate blocks of ld, genome wide. this delineation will enable the modification of the current 500k association panel, to ensure that future gwass adequately tag these blocks.

further analyses of the already obtained vrc wgs data will add in other important ways to the genetic analysis resources described here. first, we anticipate that the vervet genome assembly will undergo further refinement; as a result, we will obtain a more complete delineation of vervet structural genomic variation and also close current gaps in snp coverage. second, we will soon be able to use the vervet gene annotation to predict the functional impact of coding variants, for example, to identify missense variants predicted to have a deleterious effect. given the extensive inbreeding loops within the  <dig> -monkey vrc pedigree and its rapid expansion from  <dig> founders, we hypothesize that many such variants that may have been carried by only a single founder could now be relatively frequent among the  <dig> sequenced vrc monkeys. such variants could be the starting point for “phenome screening” of the vrc to identify traits on which they may have a substantial impact  <cit> . to conduct such studies we will need a high degree of confidence in the calling of such variants and the assignment of genotypes, particularly in those monkeys sequenced at intermediate and low depths; to obtain such confidence, we will re-sequence several hundred vrc monkeys using an independent method  and then evaluate concordance with the current genotypes. finally, we predict that this resource will enable the extension to vervet of evolutionary analyses that, among primates, have to date mainly been limited to humans  <cit> . by quantifying, in the vervet genome, segregating mutation rates for different classes of variants , we may obtain a clearer picture of similarities and differences between the evolutionary histories of humans and nhps.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the effectiveness of a strategy that combines high, medium, and low coverage wgs for generating the first high-resolution genome-wide snp resource for an nhp species. this resource will enable linkage and association studies that take advantage of the rich phenotype data available for large samples of caribbean-origin vervet monkeys.
