BACKGROUND
lignocellulosic substrates are the most abundant, low cost renewable resources worldwide  <cit> . cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin are the three main components which make up lignocellulosic biomass. via enzymatic hydrolysis, polysaccharides in the lignocellulosic substrates can be hydrolyzed to monosaccharides  <cit> . saccharification is therefore a crucial step for sugar production  <cit> . acid hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis are the two commonly used methods for hydrolysis of cellulosic materials. enzymatic hydrolysis is advantageous over acid hydrolysis. it has low environmental impact and the reaction is carried out under mild conditions  <cit> . recently, due to the constant increase in the oil price, the significance of biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass as an alternative energy source has been intensified and efficient conversion of lignocelluloses to biofuel is gaining interest  <cit> .

rice is a major crop produced in large quantities in the world  <cit>  and rice straw is the most abundant agricultural residue worldwide. approximately 700- <dig> million tons of rice straw is produced annually, most of which is found in asia. hence, rice straw is a suitable feedstock for biofuel production especially in asia  <cit> . various agricultural wastes have been used as the substrate for biobutanol production. however, not much research has focused on biobutanol production from rice straw as the feedstock for fermentation and limited research has been reported  <cit> .

as fermentable sugar production from agricultural waste is a prerequisite for bioenergy production, enormous research attempt has focused on bioconversion of cellulose into fermentable sugar  <cit> . yet, more research is required to improve the process. hence, this work focused on fermentable sugar production from alkali pretreated rice straw by using cellulase produced from a local t. harzianum snrs <dig> under solid state cultivation. rice straw hydrolysate was subsequently utilized as substrate for biobutanol production.

RESULTS
effect of alkali pretreatment of rice straw on rice straw chemical composition
alkali pretreatment of rice straw using 2%  naoh showed a rise in cellulose content of rice straw, whereas the content of lignin and hemicelluloses was decreased. table  <dig> demonstrates cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash content of rice straw both in untreated and alkali-pretreated rice straw. as shown in the table, as a result of pretreatment, rice straw was delignified and a decrease in lignin content from  <dig> % to  <dig> % was observed. there was a decrease in hemicelluloses content from  <dig> % to  <dig> % after rice straw was pretreated as well. however, cellulose content of rice straw was promoted from  <dig> % in untreated rice straw to  <dig> % after rice straw was subjected to alkali pretreatment.table  <dig>

in a study,  was used to pretreat rice straw and a decrease in lignin and hemicelluloses content of rice straw was reported from  <dig> % and  <dig> % to  <dig> % and 18%, respectively, and an increase in cellulose content of alkali-pretreated rice straw from  <dig> % to  <dig> % was noted as well  <cit> . as reported in another research, chemical composition of rice straw was different before and after pretreatment by , and a decrease in lignin and hemicelluloses content of rice straw after alkali pretreatment was observed. whereas, an increase in cellulose content occurred when rice straw was pretreated. as a result of alkali pretreatment of rice straw with , cellulose content was increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in alkali-pretreated rice straw and lignin and hemicelluloses content was decreased from  <dig> % and 28% in untreated rice straw to  <dig> % and  <dig> % in pretreated rice straw, respectively  <cit> .

effect of different concentrations of naoh for pretreatment of rice straw on reducing sugar production
rice straw pretreated with various concentrations of naoh  was used as saccharification substrate and enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw was performed. figure  <dig> illustrates the reducing sugar production profile from rice straw pretreated by using different concentrations of naoh. the reducing sugar production was increased significantly  when naoh-pretreated rice straw was used as substrate in enzymatic hydrolysis. as for the effect of incubation time, there was significant difference  for the production of reducing sugar from 0-72 h from naoh-pretreated rice straw used in enzymatic hydrolysis, except for 1%  naoh, where the production of reducing sugar was only increased significantly from 0-48 h. the detail of the statistical analysis is presented in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

according to the results obtained in this study, the enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw pretreated by using 2%  naoh resulted in the highest production of reducing sugars at  <dig>  g/l at 72 h of incubation, as compared to  <dig>  g/l reducing sugars produced from untreated rice straw.

in a study, the effect of different concentrations of naoh on enzymatic hydrolysis of bagasse using cellulases of bacillus subtilis was investigated. as reported, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate pretreated with 2%  naoh resulted in higher production of reducing sugars, as compared to enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate pretreated with  naoh. low yield of reducing sugar obtained at  naoh concentration could be due to the loss of carbohydrates that might have been solubilized while the substrate was being pretreated. in addition, the low saccharification could be attributed to the inaccessible insoluble cellulose. this might contribute to low sugar yield when saccharification substrates were pretreated at higher concentrations of naoh  <cit> .

as reported in our previous research  <cit> , after rice straw was pretreated by using alkali, not only chemical composition of rice straw was changed, but also changes in the cellulose morphological structure occurred. the results of x-ray diffraction analysis revealed an increase in relative crystallinity of cellulose in alkali-pretreated rice straw, as compared to untreated rice straw. hydrolyzation and peeling of amorphous regions during pretreatment could result in the rise in relative crystallinity of cellulose in alkali-pretreated rice straw. however, alkali pretreatment decreased the absolute crystallinity of cellulose. as the sem images showed, the pretreatment process disrupted the hemicellulose and lignin, which might have resulted in the changes in the structure of cellulose. according to the results of ftir analysis, alkali pretreatment caused lignin removal and the changes in cellulose structure.

effect of enzyme loadings on reducing sugar production
enzyme loading is an important parameter in enzymatic hydrolysis, affecting reducing sugar yield. therefore, the effect of enzyme concentration on enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw pretreated with 2%  naoh was investigated. various enzyme loadings were used for hydrolysis of 5%  rice straw pretreated with 2%  naoh as saccharification substrate. the reducing sugar production profile was studied over a period of 96 h. figure  <dig> shows that the reducing sugar production was increased significantly  according to the cellulases concentration used in enzymatic hydrolysis, except for the cellulase concentration of fpase:  <dig> u/g; cmcase:  <dig>  u/g; β-glucosidase:  <dig>  u/g and fpase:  <dig>  u/g cmcase:  <dig>  u/g; β-glucosidase:  <dig>  u/g. as for the effect of incubation time there was significant difference  for the production of reducing sugar from 0-72 h for all cellulase concentrations used in enzymatic hydrolysis. the concentration of crude cellulase at the activity of fpase:  <dig>  u/g cmcase:  <dig>  u/g; β-glucosidase:  <dig>  u/g that resulted in the production of  <dig>  g/l reducing sugar was selected for the subsequent study since the reducing sugar production was not significantly  different from the cellulase at the activity of fpase:  <dig> u/g; cmcase:  <dig>  u/g; β-glucosidase:  <dig>  u/g. the detail of the statistical analysis is presented in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

the cost of cellulase enzymes contributes to the total cost of saccharification process. hence, it is suggested to minimize enzyme dosage as much as possible  <cit> . an increase in enzyme concentration resulted in significant rise of hydrolysis rate of rice straw, wheat straw, and bagasse. however, further increase in enzyme concentration did not result in significant rise of hydrolysis rate. this might be due to improper mixing and suspension of the slurry. in fact, the rise in enzyme concentration should increase hydrolysis rate. however, it makes the process uneconomical  <cit> .

in this study, a similar trend was noted for fermentable sugar production and conversion yield percentage. a comparison between fermentable sugar production and hydrolysis yield  is illustrated in table  <dig> table  <dig>

the increase in enzyme loading favoured enzymatic hydrolysis of corncob residue  <cit> , wheat straw, rice straw, and bagasse  <cit> . a similar trend was also noted for fermentable sugar production and conversion yield percentage with the increase in concentration of the enzyme used  <cit> . as reported in other studies, a rise in reducing sugar yield occurred as the enzyme concentration increased  <cit> . therefore, the results of this research are in good agreement with other studies. the optimal ratio between enzyme and substrate is an important factor affecting efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. in fact, more active sites of the enzyme would be involved in conversion of the substrate into reducing sugars via enzymatic hydrolysis when enzyme concentration increases  <cit> .

effect of substrate concentration on reducing sugar production
efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis is determined by the optimal ratio between enzyme and substrate. hence, the effect of concentration of the substrate on reducing sugar production was investigated by using different concentrations of substrate  and the optimal unit of enzyme activity  based on the results obtained in the previous experiment. the reducing sugar profile was studied over a period of 96 h. figure  <dig> shows the reducing sugar production was increased significantly  according to the substrate concentration used in enzymatic hydrolysis, except for the substrate concentration at 5% and 7% . as for the effect of incubation time there was significant difference  for the production of reducing sugar from 0-72 h for all substrate concentrations used in enzymatic hydrolysis. 5%  substrate that resulted in the production of  <dig>  g/l reducing sugars was selected as substrate concentration for reducing sugar production in subsequent study since the reducing sugar production was not significantly different  from 7%  substrate concentration. the detail of the statistical analysis is presented in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

enzymatic hydrolysis of 10%  rice straw resulted in the production of higher reducing sugar, as compared to  substrates. as a result,  <dig>  g/l reducing sugar was obtained  <cit> . effect of substrate concentration on reducing sugar production was investigated by using various lignocellulosic substrates such as corncob, sunflower stalks, wheat straw, rice straw, and bagasse and it was shown that the increase in substrate concentration favoured reducing sugar production  <cit> . in this study, an opposite trend was noted between reducing sugar concentration and hydrolysis yield . with the rise in substrate concentration, sugar production increased. however, hydrolysis yield percentage decreased due to end product inhibition and mixing problems. similar results have been reported by other researchers  <cit> . enzymatic hydrolysis of various lignocellulosic materials using a variety of enzyme sources has been reported by other researchers. in a study, a comparison was made between the use of celluclast and a combination of celluclast and periconia sp. bcc  <dig> as the source of enzyme for hydrolysis of rice straw and a reducing sugar production of  <dig> and 132 mg/g substrate was reported, respectively  <cit> . cellulase from t. reesei zm4f <dig> was used for enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw and as a result, 733 mg/g substrate reducing sugar was produced  <cit> . use of cellulase by trametes hirsuta for enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw resulted in the production of 685 mg/g substrate reducing sugars and a hydrolysis yield of 88% was achieved  <cit> . rice straw was enzymatically hydrolyzed by cellulases from t. reesei a <dig> and penicillium sp. b <dig>  as a result, a reducing sugar concentration of  <dig> and 316 mg/g substrate and a hydrolysis yield of  <dig> % and  <dig> % were obtained, respectively  <cit> . as reported in a research, enzymatic hydrolysis of rice hull by a combination of celluclast  <dig>  l and novozyme  <dig> resulted in the production of 154 mg/g substrate reducing sugar and 32% hydrolysis yield was achieved  <cit> . bagasse was hydrolyzed by cellulases from penicillium janthinellum ncim  <dig> and 846 mg/g substrate reducing sugar equivalent to  <dig> % hydrolysis yield was obtained  <cit> . enzymatic hydrolysis of maize straw by cellulase from t. reesei zu- <dig> produced 814 mg/g substrate reducing sugar and  <dig> % conversion yield was obtained  <cit> . in this study, as a result of enzymatic hydrolysis of alkali-pretreated rice straw using cellulase from t. harzianum snrs <dig>  a reducing sugar yield of 600 mg/g substrate and a hydrolysis yield of  <dig> % were achieved, as compared to reducing sugar production of 800 mg/g substrate and  <dig> % conversion yield obtained when celluclast was used.

as a result of enzymatic hydrolysis of alkali-pretreated rice straw using cellulase from t. harzianum snrs <dig>  a reducing sugar yield of 600 mg/g substrate and a hydrolysis yield of  <dig> % were achieved.

fpase as the rate-limiting enzyme
cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis needs all the three componets of cellulase enzyme complex system to act synergistically. however, to study the significant role of fpase in cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis, four combinations of cellulase enzyme were used in this study. the reducing sugar profile was studied over a period of 96 h. table  <dig> shows that the production of reducing sugar was increased significantly  according to the concentration of fpase. as for the effect of incubation time, the reducing sugar production was significantly increased  from 0-72 h for all the enzyme concentrations used in enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw. the detail of the statistical analysis is presented in table  <dig> table  <dig>

as shown in table  <dig>  at 72 h of enzymatic hydrolysis and at concentration of fpase,  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml for celluclast and the crude cellulase, respectively, regardless of the significant difference in the concentration of β-glucosidase present in celluclast  and that in the crude cellulase ,  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l reducing sugars were obtained by using celluclast and the crude cellulase of t. harzianum snrs <dig>  respectively. moreover, glucose concentration was detected at  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l for celluclast and the crude cellulase, respectively. however, when β-glucosidase activity was fixed at  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml for celluclast and crude cellulase while fpase concentration for celluclast and the crude cellulase was different at the activity of  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml for celluclast and the crude cellulase, respectively, the reducing sugar analysis revealed a much higher production of reducing sugars by celluclast, as compared to the crude cellulase. as a result,  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l reducing sugars were obtained by using celluclast and the crude cellulase, respectively. the results of hplc analysis revealed that glucose at the concentration of  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l was obtained when celluclast and the crude cellulase were used, respectively.

cellulases consist of three main enzymes, endoglucanase or cmcase, exoglucanase or cellobiohydrolase and β-glucosidase, which act synergistically in the cellulose hydrolysis process  <cit> . endoglucanase attacks intramolecular β- <dig> -glucosidic bonds in cellulose polymeric chain, leaving new chain ends for exoglucanase to cleave. exoglucanase or cellobiohydrolase is the second hydrolytic enzyme attacking cellulose chain in the ends producing cellobiose or glucose, while β-glucosidase converts cellobiose to glucose. therefore, endoglucanase and exoglucanase are mainly responsible for depolymerization of cellulose polymer chains and this enzymatic depolymerization step is the rate-limiting step in cellulose hydrolysis process  <cit> . the effect of different ratios of cellulase and β-glucosidase on glucose production was studied and it was shown that the ratio of cellulase to β-glucosidase 5: <dig> gave higher glucose concentration, as compared to the ratio of 1:  <dig>  where the lowest glucose concentration was produced. in fact, the latter ratio only resulted in the excess of β- glucosidase in the reaction mixture  <cit> . therefore, the results of this study are in accordance with those reported in other research  <cit>  that laid emphasis on the need for the presence of fpase at a substantial concentration in the cellulase enzyme complex for an efficient hydrolysis. from the results of this study, it is inferred that for an efficient cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis, the presence of the whole set of cellulose hydrolytic enzymes is required. fpase is a major component of cellulase enzymes complex, lack of which causes inefficient cellulose hydrolysis. this leads to a low production of reducing sugars and the presence of β-glucosidase at a high concentration would not help in such a condition since this latter enzyme is only accumulated as the relative activity of β-glucosidase to fpase is much higher.

production of abe by c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> using rice straw hydrolysate
rice straw hydrolysate was used as the substrate for abe production. based on the results of hplc, rice straw hydrolysate contained glucose, xylose, and arabinose as individual sugars. concentration of the individual sugars is shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

in order to investigate the application of fermentable sugars produced from pretreated rice straw using the crude cellulase, rice straw hydrolysate obtained, was employed as fermentation substrate in abe fermentation by c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  in order to compare the results of abe fermentation obtained in this study, glucose  was used as a model substrate. as can be seen from figure  <dig>  fermentation of  glucose as a model substrate resulted in the production of a total abe concentration of  <dig>  g/l . while, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the results of rice straw hydrolysate fermentation by c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> indicates a maximum total abe production of  <dig>  g/l .figure  <dig>

in a research, fermentation of 10 g/l, and 20 g/l glucose by c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  resulted in the production of  <dig>  g/l total abe , and  <dig>  g/l total abe , when 10 g/l, and 20 g/l glucose were used, respectively  <cit> . in another study, domestic organic waste containing  as carbon source was used in fermentation by c. acetobutylicum dsm  <dig> and  <dig>  g/l total abe was produced  <cit> .

in fermentation of rice straw hydrolysate, at 48 h of fermentation, glucose as the primary and preferred carbon source was totally consumed. it is worth noticing that clostridia are able to consume pentoses as well as hexoses  <cit> . however, arabinose was not consumed by the strain, whereas xylose was consumed. hence, fermentable sugars produced via enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw showed to be potential sugars as substrate for abe production and can be applied for production of biofuels such as biobutanol.

the results of kinetic studies are indicated in table  <dig>  as can be seen from the table, kinetic studies indicated a cell yield and biomass productivity of  <dig>  g cell/g glucose, and  <dig>  g/l/h, respectively. fermentation of rice straw hydrolysate resulted in an abe yield and productivity of  <dig>  g/g glucose, and  <dig>  g/l/h, respectively. a butanol yield of  <dig>  g/g glucose was achieved.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
the present study confirmed that the use of naoh as an alkali reagent for pretreatment of rice straw could be effective. the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of alkali-pretreated rice straw and the use of rice straw hydrolysate as the substrate for biobutanol production was shown to be successful. the use of 2%  naoh was shown to be the most effective concentration of naoh for pretreatment of rice straw. enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw pretreated with 2%  naoh resulted in a reducing sugar yield of  <dig>  g/g substrate and  <dig> % saccharification was obtained. reducing sugar production increased with the increase in the concentration of the enzyme and a similar trend was observed between fermentable sugar production and hydrolysis yield .with the rise in substrate concentration, fermentable sugar production increased as well. however, an opposite trend was observed between substrate concentration and hydrolysis yield  due to stirring difficulties, poor mixing, and end product inhibition. the use of 5%  substrate resulted in the highest concentration of reducing sugars. rice straw hydrolysate was successfully utilized as substrate for biobutanol production resulting in an abe yield and productivity of  <dig>  g/g glucose and  <dig>  g/l/h, respectively. a butanol yield of  <dig>  g/g glucose was achieved. the study also confirmed that, as an enzyme complex, in order for cellulase to be efficient, the presence of all the components at substantial concentration is highly required and that the presence of β-glucosidase at a high concentration would not help in case fpase is not present at high enough concentration to initiate the cellulolytic reaction. in fact, in such a condition the addition of β-glucosidase is not effective since this enzyme is only accumulated due to the lack of cellobiose, the substrate for this enzyme.
