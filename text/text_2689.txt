BACKGROUND
how organisms acquire resources and allocate them to the demands of maintenance, defence, repair, storage, growth and reproduction are central questions in physiological ecology  <cit> . after energy and nutrients have been partitioned between these major demands, further allocations can be made. for example, investing in reproduction will vary according to age and energetic status with important fitness consequences. numerous studies have reported morphological and behavioural attributes influencing male mating success that include display rates  <cit> , body size  <cit> , body condition  <cit> , lek centrality  <cit>  and lek attendance  <cit> . many of these attributes reflect how males can acquire energy and how they allocate it during the reproductive season.

male anurans are especially interesting subjects to study how energy is partitioned for reproduction, because calling is energetically very expensive  <cit>  and acoustic energy can easily be partitioned between call duration, calling rate, call amplitude, number of hours calling within a night, number of nights calling within a breeding season, and the number of breeding seasons in attendance.

in anurans, inter- and intrasexual selection are important determinants of mating success  <cit> . in most species of anurans with a lek mating system studied to date, male mating success is determined by the number of nights that a male is present in a breeding aggregation, i.e. chorus tenure  <cit> . thus, there should be strong selection on males to increase their chorus tenure. paradoxically, males of most anuran species spend less than 20% of the breeding season in the chorus  <cit> .

a variety of hypotheses have been suggested that might explain short chorus tenure in anurans  <cit> . first, high rates of mortality within and away from the chorus are one hypothesis. second, chorus tenure could be underestimated if males move between ponds and monitoring is restricted to a single chorus. the energetic limitation hypothesis offers a third explanation for short chorus tenure in anurans. males may need to allocate the available energy into the maintenance of vital processes and growth with limited energy reserves left for reproduction and attracting females. since calling is energetically very costly  <cit> , males will not be able to maintain high rates of calling, or be present in the chorus on many nights, conditions that are necessary to attract females.

so far, studies of energy allocation in anurans have concentrated on the effects of energetic constraints on body condition and chorus tenure. short term allocation strategies such as modulating the number of calls produced during nightly chorus attendance or varying calling rates have received less attention  <cit> . if calling rate and chorus tenure of a male are positively correlated with his reproductive success, there should be a trade-off between both parameters since males will be unlikely to be able to allocate unlimited energy to both behaviours. males should allocate energy preferentially to the strategy that most strongly affects male mating success.

in this paper we investigate the effects of energetic constraints on breeding behaviour of male european treefrogs, hyla arborea , a species of considerable conservation interest  <cit> . we hypothesized that if breeding behaviour is energetically limited, then males should lose body condition between their first and last night in the breeding chorus. if additional energy is provided experimentally, then fed and unfed males should have different final conditions and different rates of change in condition. if the prime target of selection is to increase chorus tenure, then males provided with food should be in the chorus more nights than unfed males. in addition, fed males should return to the chorus sooner than unfed males. if the prime target of selection is to call at high rates and thus out-compete other males, then fed males should allocate the available energy to calling on few nights and should have a higher rate of calling than unfed males.

RESULTS
body condition
the mean snout-vent length and tibiafibula length of captured males was  <dig> ±  <dig> mm  and  <dig> ±  <dig> mm , respectively. the average initial weight was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g. the median initial body condition was  <dig>  g for fed <dig>   <dig>  g for fed <dig> and - <dig>  g for the control males. males in the three groups did not differ in their initial body condition .

no significant relationship was detectable between the first noted presence at the pond and the condition that same day . however, the control males  as well as fed <dig> males  and fed <dig> males  lost weight significantly during the season . the average final condition was not influenced by feeding . fed as well as unfed males were in the same condition at the end of the season . in addition, the supply of supplementary energy showed no influence on the rate of change in body condition .

chorus tenure
in  <dig>  chorus tenure varied between the individual males. the median chorus tenure for fed <dig> was  <dig>  nights; for the control males and fed <dig> the median chorus tenure was  <dig> nights . thus, both the control males and fed <dig> males were present in the chorus for only  <dig> % of the possible time. fed <dig> spent only  <dig> % of the nights in the chorus. five males were only present  <dig> night . on average, control males stayed  <dig>  nights in the calling aggregation . this time interval amounted to  <dig>  nights for fed <dig> and to  <dig>  nights for fed <dig> 

there were no significant differences in chorus tenure between the treatment groups . males, which were fed, did not return to the chorus for more nights compared to males that were not provided with extra food.

among the fed males  the mass of consumed crickets  did not explain chorus tenure . males that had consumed more energy did not stay in the chorus longer than males that had taken up less energy.

for fed males, the median number of nights between the treatment night and the first night that they returned was  <dig>  control males were absent longer . fed males returned back into the chorus after a significantly shorter time .

calling rate
additional available energy was invested into the rate of calling. control males had a significantly lower calling rate than fed males . this difference in calling rate was shown despite the often long delay  between call recordings and feeding treatment. in  <dig>  the recordings were taken between a time period of  <dig> to  <dig> nights  after the treatment; in  <dig> they were taken  <dig> to  <dig> nights  after the treatment.

control males that entered the analysis called at a rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  calls/min, whereas fed males called at  <dig> ±  <dig>  calls/min. fed <dig> males received a median of  <dig>  g crickets. with an assimilation efficiency of  <dig>   <cit>  this corresponds to a median energy input of  <dig>  j. with an average weight of  <dig>  g and an average oxygen consumption during calling of  <dig>  ml/g·h  <cit>  a call corresponds to  <dig>  j .

discussion
for male tree frogs hyla arborea, the number of nights they stayed within the chorus was a crucial factor for their mating success. however, males showed an short chorus tenure  <cit> , which is typical of most anurans  <cit> . at first the results seem paradoxical. if males can increase their mating success by an increased chorus tenure, why then are they absent during the largest part of the reproductive season? as a possible explanation we tested the hypothesis of energetic limitation. under this hypothesis males would exhibit reduced chorus tenure, because they are not able to compensate the energetic costs of calling .

as in many other anurans  <cit>  chorus attendance was energetically expensive for male european tree frogs  <cit> . males lost significant mass during the investigation period. on average, they lost  <dig>  –  <dig>  g between their first and last night in the chorus. with a mean weight of  <dig>  g males lost between  <dig>  –  <dig> % of their body mass each night. but fed and unfed males did not differ in final condition or in the rate of change in condition. these results show that males do not invest the energy gained by supplementary feeding into maintaining or establishing energy reserves.

h. arborea males can reach momentary rates of oxygen consumption 41-times resting rate during calling  <cit> . these are the highest aerobic scopes measured so far in any ectothermic vertebrate. the high energetic cost of calling forces males to trade-off call duration, calling rate, call amplitude, number of hours calling within a night, number of nights calling within a breeding season, and the number of breeding seasons in attendance. our study shows, that male h. arborea invest additional energy obtained from food in two ways: they return to the chorus sooner and increase their calling rate.

as in this study, similar feeding experiments of rana catesbeiana  <cit> , rana clamitans  <cit>  and physalaemus pustulosus  <cit>  showed no increase in male chorus tenure. in contrast, murphy  <cit>  found an increased chorus tenure due to supplementary feeding in hyla gratiosa. in hyla arborea, the energy input seems to have had a short term effect on a male's presence at the pond. fed males returned back to the chorus after significantly fewer nights than control males suggesting that fed males were able to recover from calling activity sooner.

calling rate is an important determinant of female choice in most anurans  <cit> . in behavioral tests, females of most anuran species that have been tested prefer males that call at high rates. this preference is generally robust even under acoustically complex field conditions .

if males can increase their reproductive success by calling at higher rates, they should do so if they have sufficient energy reserves. hyla arborea is the first anuran known to allocate supplementary food to calling rate. males which were supplied with additional energy by supplementary feeding, showed significantly higher calling rates than the control males . fed males showed an average calling rate of  <dig> calls/min, whereas control males produced an average of  <dig>  calls/min. it is remarkable, that this difference concerning the calling rate was still detected several days after feeding. in the first year of the study, calling rate was recorded between the 1st and 31st night after males had been fed. in all cases, males seemed to allocate the additional energy in increased calling rate over a period of many nights instead of investing all the energy immediately during the first few nights following feeding.

this strategy of measured energy allocation provides males with the ability to call at higher rates than their competitors and thus remain attractive over many nights. females of other hylids have been shown to prefer males calling at high rates  <cit> . a large difference in calling rate in comparison to competitors, however, does not translate proportionally to mating success. in pseudacris crucifer  <cit>  and hyperolius marmoratus  <cit>  females are able to discriminate differences in calling rate of just  <dig> calls/min  and  <dig> calls/min , respectively. additional increases in calling rate did not further increase female preferences. selection should therefore favour the strategy of a slightly increased calling rate , which could be kept up not only for one night but several  <cit> .

in our study, the difference in calling rates of fed males and control males with the same total chorus tenure suggests a trade-off between calling effort and chorus tenure. in this context it would be interesting to determine if and to what degree higher calling rates are preferred by female european tree frogs.

friedl  <cit>  was not able to show a correlation between the mating success of hyla arborea males and their calling rate. but his method of determining reproductive success was based on the assumption that females can choose between all males present in the chorus. this is highly unlikely and unprecedented. most likely, females show selective attention for a subset of the males present to minimize the costs of mate sampling thus reducing predation pressure, time, energy, and opportunity costs  <cit> . such a comparative mate sampling behaviour by females is described by friedl & klump  <cit>  in the course of their field observations of h. arborea, whereby the females seemed to assess only a few males before they made their mating decision. additionally, the results of friedl  <cit>  could be due to male density as well as spatial and temporal pattern in their study population. above all, if the effect is small, it may be impossible to demonstrate without big sample sizes and multiple year studies. the fact that fed males showed higher calling rates suggest that males would on average benefit from higher mating success at least over evolutionary time.

CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that male calling rate is an important criterion of female mate choice. males invested the additional energy gained by feeding into increasing calling rates. furthermore, males showed higher calling rates in larger choruses  probably due to competition with other males to attract females. in this context, it would be important for future investigations to determine which mate sampling tactic female european treefrogs are using as well as which and to what degree parameters such as calling rate are preferred.
