BACKGROUND
poly polymerase- <dig>  is a highly evolutionary preserved, multifunctional nuclear enzyme that catalyzes the addition of adp-ribose  units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  on a large variety of nuclear proteins and consequently impinges on many of the major nuclear functions . gene inactivation studies have revealed and/or confirmed up to nine biological functions for parp- <dig>  <cit> . these include both dna repair and maintenance of genomic integrity as well as regulation of telomerase activity  <cit>  . parp- <dig> also regulates the expression of various proteins at the transcriptional level  and is also involved in dna replication as well as cell differentiation  <cit> . in addition, polymer of adp ribose  has been recently identified as an emergency source of energy used by the base-excision machinery to synthesize atp  <cit> . par may also serve as a signal to induce cell death  <cit> . finally, parp- <dig> may contribute to the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and in the post-transcriptional modification of nuclear proteins like histones and transcription factors .

parp- <dig> plays vital functions in gene transcription as it can influence the state of chromatin remodeling through the catalytic addition of par to the core histones  <cit> . besides, parp- <dig>  through its double zn-finger dna binding domain, can interact with target regulatory elements present in the promoter of many genes, including the mcat  <dig>  <cit> , pax- <dig>  <cit> , mhc ii  <cit> , and the cxcl <dig>  <cit>  genes. by exploiting both chromatin cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assays, soldatenkov and coworkers elegantly demonstrated that parp- <dig> could also bind to secondary hairpin-like structures present in the 5'-flanking region of the human parp- <dig> promoter  <cit> . although no prototypical sequence that could be recognized as a target by the parp- <dig> dbd has been identified yet, pion and collaborators have however demonstrated the ability of the protein to bind to both 5'- and 3'-recessed ends on double-stranded dna, as well as to palindromic-like structures often present in dna  <cit> . lastly, parp- <dig> can also alter gene transcription through its ability to polyate several transcription factors, such as yy <dig>  <cit> , nfkb  <cit> , tfiif  <cit> , oct- <dig>  <cit> , b-myb  <cit>  and ap- <dig>  <cit> , thereby preventing their binding with their specific promoter target sites  <cit> .

the studies conducted over the last few decades have been mostly dedicated to the study of the many biological and cellular functions of parp- <dig>  unfortunately, not so many studies have explored the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transcription of parp- <dig> gene expression. unlike its enzymatic activity, parp- <dig> gene transcription is not activated by dna strand breaks  <cit> . on the other hand, parp- <dig> gene expression appears related to cell proliferation rather than dna synthesis as parp- <dig> mrna has been shown to be more abundant in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . to date, the parp- <dig> promoter has been cloned from three different mammalian species: human  <cit> , rat  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . all three mammalian basal promoters share structural similarities typical of housekeeping genes in that they lack a functional consensus tata box, possess a high content of gc-residues, and bear a consensus initiator sequence  that overlaps the transcription initiation site. the human promoter has been shown to contain binding sites for the transcription factors sp <dig>  ap- <dig>  <cit> , yy <dig>  <cit> , and ets  <cit> , whereas the mouse promoter was recently shown to be down-regulated by a complex of adenovirus e1a protein and prb  <cit> . studies that we conducted on the rat parp- <dig>  proximal promoter have shown that its activity is primarily, but not entirely dependent on the recognition of five gc-rich binding sites  by the positive transcription factors sp <dig> and sp <dig>  <cit> . other transcription factors, such as those that belong to the nuclear factor i  family of transcription factors  <cit> , were also found to bind to nearby target sites to alter the activity directed by the parp- <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . sp <dig> and sp <dig>  two members from a zn-finger family of transcription factors that presently comprises nine proteins   <cit> , often compete with each other for the recognition of their common gc-rich target sites  <cit> . however, sp <dig> is a transcriptional activator, while sp <dig> can, according to the context, function either as a repressor or an activator of gene transcription  <cit> . the nfi family is composed of four members encoded by distinct genes, nfi-a, -b, -c, and -x  <cit> , producing distinct protein products, which can form homo- or heterodimers  <cit> . in addition, all four nfi mrnas can be differentially spliced to yield a large number of nfi isoforms with subtle differences in their transactivation properties  <cit> . nfi has been reported to repress the activity directed by the rparp- <dig> promoter  <cit> . however, as nfi was found to be transcriptionally inert by itself as it possesses no intrinsic activity in the regulation of the rparp- <dig> promoter, its negative influence was suggested to result from the fact that it competes with sp <dig> for the availability of a promoter composite element that bears overlapping target sites for both these transcription factors  <cit> . consequently, by exploiting either the synergistic or antagonistic effects of the transcription factors they bind to respectively over-activate or down-regulate transcription, the combination of regulatory elements that constitute the parp- <dig> promoter provides an efficient way of fine-tuning its expression in different cellular contexts.

as with many other nuclear proteins, both sp <dig> and nfi can be subjected to post-translational modifications through mechanisms such as phosphorylation and/or glycosylation  <cit> . however, neither of these transcription factors, which are both required to ensure proper transcription of the parp- <dig> gene, has been shown to be also subjected to polyation by parp- <dig>  in the present study, we examined both the expression and dna binding properties of sp <dig> and nfi in embryonic fibroblasts cultured from normal mice that express the intact, wild-type parp- <dig> protein , or from parp- <dig> knockout mice  that are devoided of any parp- <dig> enzymatic activity  <cit> . we demonstrated that parp- <dig> physically associates, through protein-protein interaction, with sp <dig> but not sp <dig> or nfi in immunoprecipitation assays. sp <dig> was also found to be a target of parp- <dig> as addition of par to this transcription factor could be demonstrated. preventing polyation of sp <dig> in the parp- <dig> deficient knockout cells also resulted in a substantial increase in the activity directed by rat parp- <dig> promoter, a clear indication that addition of par to sp <dig> reduces its transactivation properties in vivo.

RESULTS
expression and dna binding of sp <dig>  sp <dig> and nfi in parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells
to investigate whether suppression of parp- <dig> activity would result in alterations in the level of expression and/or the dna binding activity of the transcription factors that are critical for the transcription of the parp- <dig> gene, crude nuclear extracts were prepared from embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from both normal  and parp- <dig> knockout mice   <cit> . these extracts were then used to monitor the expression and dna binding activity of transcription factors  that have been reported to play critical functions in parp- <dig> gene transcription  <cit> . as expected, parp-1+/+ fibroblasts appropriately expressed the parp- <dig> protein whereas no parp- <dig> expression could be detected in the parp-1-/- cell line . whereas no alteration was observed in the level of sp <dig> expression between both types of cells, a dramatic reduction was however observed for sp <dig> in parp-1-/- cells. nfi, which yields multiple bands in the emsa due to the fact that different isoforms have been recognized for this transcription factor, primarily appeared as a fast migrating protein species when nuclear extracts from parp-1+/+ cells are used in western blotting . however, the electrophoretic mobility of this nfi protein species was considerably reduced in parp-1-/- cells , suggesting that nfi is either subjected to post-translational modifications or to the differential expression of a specific isoform that is distinct from that seen in parp-1+/+ cells.

in order to verify whether both the decrease in sp <dig> expression and change in the mobility of the nfi protein also resulted in a corresponding alterations in the dna binding of both transcription factors, emsa experiments were conducted. crude nuclear proteins from both the parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells were therefore incubated with 5'-end labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the high affinity-binding site for either sp <dig> or nfi. dna-protein complexes were resolved on native polyacrylamide gels and their position revealed by autoradiography. as shown on figure 2a, both the nfi and sp <dig> labeled probe yielded the appropriate dna-protein complexes corresponding to the binding of both factors to their respective target sequence when incubated with the extract from parp-1+/+ cells. however, and consistent with the results of the western blot analyses shown on figure  <dig>  formation of both complexes was considerably reduced when the sp <dig> and nfi labeled probe were incubated with the extract from parp-1-/- cells. formation of the sp <dig> complex observed with the extracts from both the parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells was found to be specific as it was entirely competed off by as little as a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled sp <dig> oligomer, but not at all by the unrelated nfi site . the reduced binding of sp <dig> in parp-1-/- cells did not result from changes in the affinity of sp <dig> toward its gc-rich target site but rather from a decrease in its expression at the protein level as a corresponding reduction was also observed for this transcription factor in western blot analysis . identical results were observed also for the nfi complex whose formation was competed by the nfi but not the sp <dig> oligomers .

the identity of the proteins that yielded the shifted complexes using the sp <dig> labeled probe was further investigated by supershift analyses in emsas using antibodies directed against either sp <dig> and sp <dig>  two closely related transcription factors from the same family  <cit> . as shown on figure 2d, the sp <dig> ab strongly reduced the migration of the complex with the lowest electrophoretic mobility but had no influence on the weaker, faster migrating complex. on the other hand, the antibody against sp <dig> only slightly decreased the electrophoretic mobility of the slow complex but entirely competed the fast migrating one. incubation of both the sp <dig> and sp <dig> abs together entirely supershifted both complexes, using the nuclear extracts from both the parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cell lines. both antibodies yielded super-shifted complexes  corresponding to the signal yielded by the ab-sp1-dna complex. these results indicate that the slow migrating complex is made up of both sp <dig> and sp <dig> bound to the labeled probe  whereas the faster migrating complex is entirely made up of sp <dig>  a similar experiment was also conducted on the dna-protein complex yielded by the incubation of both the parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- nuclear extracts with the nfi probe. as presented on figure 2d, addition of the nfi ab reduced the electrophoretic mobility of the nfi complex from both the parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- protein extracts and yielded a new super-shifted complex resulting from the recognition of the nfi-dna complex by the nfi ab. we therefore conclude that expression and dna binding of both sp <dig> and nfi is severely reduced in the parp- <dig> knockout  cells.

to eliminate the possibility that a widespread suppression of all transcription factors might have accounted for the drop in both sp <dig> and nfi expression in parp-1-/- knockout cells, we investigated the expression and dna binding properties of transcription factors unrelated to the transcription of the parp- <dig> gene. double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the target sites for the transcription factors ap- <dig>  e2f <dig> and stat- <dig> were therefore 5'-end labeled and used in emsa in combination with nuclear extracts obtained from both parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells. as shown on figure  <dig>  whereas binding of ap- <dig> to its prototypical target site was entirely abolished in parp-1-/- cells, that of both e2f <dig> and stat- <dig> remained unaffected by the lack of parp- <dig> expression in the knockout cells. western blot analyses indicated that the lack of ap- <dig> binding resulted from the absence of c-jun in the parp-1-/- cells, whereas no change was observed in the expression of both the e2f <dig> and stat- <dig> proteins. therefore, the reduction in the expression and dna binding of both sp <dig> and nfi is closely linked to the lack of functional parp- <dig> in the parp-1-/- knockout cells and is not merely the consequence of a general shutdown of gene expression that might have occurred in these cells.

parp- <dig> physically interacts with sp1
as parp- <dig> has been shown to physically interact with many nuclear proteins of which some are transcription factors, we then wished to determine whether any of sp <dig>  sp <dig> or nfi could represent a target for parp- <dig> in vitro. sp <dig> was therefore immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts prepared from parp+/+ and parp-/- cells using the sp <dig> ab  and the immunoprecipitated proteins analyzed on western blot with abs directed against either sp <dig> or parp- <dig> . as shown on figure 4a, sp <dig> was very efficiently immunoprecipitated with the sp <dig> ab as it could be detected in the extracts from both the parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells. as expected, a much weaker sp <dig> signal was obtained with the parp-1-/- nuclear extract. western blotting the sp1-immunoprecipitated proteins with the parp- <dig> ab revealed clearly the presence of parp- <dig> in the extract from parp-1+/+ cells but not in that from parp-1-/- cells, suggesting that indeed, sp <dig> and parp- <dig> can physically interact with each other. as expected, no signal was observed when either protein a-sepharose  or a rabbit igg ab were added as negative controls to the extract in the absence of sp <dig> ab. blotting of the membrane with the lp- <dig> ab against par revealed the presence of two polylated proteins in the extract from parp-1+/+ but not parp-1-/- cells: a more intense band with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that corresponding to parp- <dig>  and a weaker, faster-migrating band with a mobility on gel identical to that expected for sp <dig>  again, both negative controls  and rabbit igg ab) yielded no signal at a position similar to those seen with the sp <dig> ab. as a positive control, total proteins were prepared from e. coli cells transformed with a recombinant plasmid that encodes high levels of a fully functional, truncated parp- <dig>  <cit> , and used in western blotting. as shown on figure 4a, blotting of the bacterially produced recombinant parp- <dig> protein with the par ab lp- <dig> revealed a smear that is typical of par-modified proteins  <cit> .

to further validate the results from the sp <dig> immunoprecipitation, the reverse experiment was conducted by first immunoprecipitating the parp- <dig> associated proteins from total protein extracts prepared from parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells using the f1– <dig> ab against parp- <dig>  we selected this ab primarily because it is much more efficient in immunoprecipitating parp- <dig> than the c-2- <dig> ab. the transcription factors sp <dig>  sp <dig> and nfi could be detected easily by western blot in the total extracts from both parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells prior to immunoprecipitation of parp- <dig> . immunoprecipitation of parp- <dig> with the f1– <dig> ab and further western blotting of the precipitated proteins revealed clearly that the f1– <dig> ab was efficient in immunoprecipitating parp- <dig> in the extract from parp-1+/+ but not from parp-1-/- cells. in addition, sp <dig> could also be revealed in the immunoprecipitate using the sc- <dig> ab. on the other hand, the abs against sp <dig> and nfi could not detect any of these transcription factors in the parp- <dig> immunoprecipitate. we therefore conclude that sp <dig> but not sp <dig> nor nfi associate physically with parp- <dig> in vitro through protein-protein interactions.

parp- <dig> enzymatic activity is not required for its interaction with sp1
we next examined whether the interaction between parp- <dig> and sp <dig> would be affected by the activation state of the parp- <dig> enzyme in wild-type parp-1+/+ cells. sp <dig> was therefore immunoprecipitated in nuclear extracts from parp-1+/+ cells that have been grown either alone , or in the presence of hydrogen peroxide  to induce parp- <dig> activity. exposure of cells to h2o <dig> in vivo did not prevent nor improve the interaction between sp <dig> and parp- <dig> . similarly, preventing parp- <dig> activity by culturing parp-1+/+ cells in the presence of the parp- <dig> inhibitor pj <dig> did not alter the sp1/parp- <dig> interaction in vivo. the ip experiments shown above were all conducted on extracts obtained from parp-1+/+ cells in the absence of any added dna. although we could not detect any contaminating genomic dna when increasing amounts  of the extract from the parp-1+/+ cells are ran on an agarose gel and then stained with ethidium bromide , yet the possibility remained that undetectable traces of genomic dna might have been present in our extracts and then contributed to the interaction between both sp <dig> and parp- <dig> by providing potential target sites to which sp <dig> would first interact with. therefore, in order to avoid any possible interference by any traces of contaminating genomic dna, we repeated the ip experiment with the sp <dig> antibody, but this time added ethidium bromide to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the primary abs in order to avoid any possible interaction of sp <dig> with any putative target sites in dna. as shown on figure  <dig>  the presence of ethidium bromide did not alter in any way the co-immunoprecipitation of parp- <dig> along with sp <dig> in parp-1+/+ cells. most interestingly, over-activation of parp- <dig> activity in in vitro parp assays not only resulted in a massive addition of par to parp- <dig>  as revealed by the dramatic change in its electrophoretic mobility, but also entirely abolished interaction with sp <dig>  therefore indicating that addition of par to parp- <dig> beyond a certain level also interferes with its ability to bind sp <dig> 

sp <dig> is a target of parp- <dig> enzymatic activity
as the par ab revealed the presence of a polyated protein in the sp <dig> immunoprecipitate that has the same electrophoretic mobility as that of sp <dig>  we therefore used in vitro parp assays to determine whether parp- <dig> could add par to this transcription factor. western blot analyses were conducted to monitor both the parp- <dig> and sp <dig> proteins, as well as their polyation by the addition of par. parp- <dig> alone possesses no intrinsic activity in the absence of its substrate nad+ . however, the addition of  <dig> μm nad+ was sufficient to turn on parp- <dig> activity, which then added par to itself  through its automodification domain. automodification of parp- <dig>  which dramatically changed its electrophoretic mobility in sds-page , was entirely prevented when the parp- <dig> inhibitor pj <dig> was added to the reaction mix . as shown on lane  <dig>  recombinant sp <dig> is initially free of par. however, upon incubation with both parp- <dig> and nad+, a faint band with a molecular mass corresponding to sp <dig>  could be detected with the par ab just beneath the signal  corresponding to the automodified parp- <dig> . again, the addition of the pj <dig> parp- <dig> inhibitor entirely prevented the addition of par to both proteins . in order to demonstrate the specific addition of par to both sp <dig> and parp- <dig>  both recombinant proteins were incubated together along with nad+ as in lane  <dig>  protein samples were electrophoresed on sds-page and transferred on membranes as above. the par covalently linked onto the automodified parp- <dig> and sp <dig> proteins transferred on the membranes was then erased by incubation with parg. as shown on figure 6a , no polymer could be detected by the par ab on both the parp- <dig> and sp <dig> proteins upon exposure to parg. the fact that the proteins were first fractionated on the sds gel and membrane-transferred prior to the treatment with parg explains the lack of any change in the electrophoretic mobility of parp- <dig> on gel , which again appears as a smear due to the initial addition of par.

we then monitored whether addition of par to sp <dig> in vitro would alter its dna binding properties in emsa. as shown on figure 6b , the recombinant sp <dig> protein yielded the typical sp <dig> dna-protein complex upon addition of the sp <dig> labeled probe when incubated with the reaction mix containing both nad+ and nicked dna in the absence of parp- <dig>  however, addition of parp- <dig> to the reaction mix severely reduced binding of sp <dig> to its corresponding labeled probe . the further addition of the inhibitor pj <dig> prevented the addition of par by parp- <dig> and entirely restored the binding properties of sp <dig> . we next tested whether the addition of par to endogenous sp <dig> would also reduce its dna binding properties in vivo in crude nuclear extracts prepared from parp-1+/+ cells grown in the presence of h2o <dig> to activate parp- <dig> in these cells. a dramatic reduction in the binding of sp <dig> to its dna target probe was observed in emsa when parp- <dig> activity was increased in h2o2-treated cells . this h2o2-dependent reduction in sp <dig> binding was entirely abolished when h2o2-treated cells were also added the parp- <dig> inhibitor pj <dig> . western blot analyses provided evidence that neither of these treatments  had any influence on the parp- <dig> or sp <dig> protein level , a further indication that the reduced binding of sp <dig> in h2o2-treated cells can be accounted for by post-translational addition of par to sp <dig> by parp- <dig>  monitoring the addition of par to the parp- <dig> protein with the 10-h antibody against the polymer confirmed that exposing parp-1+/+ cells to the parp- <dig> inducer h2o <dig> indeed resulted in the automodification of endogenous parp- <dig>  that again appears as a smear in western blotting .

there are many potential hypotheses that may explain why expression of both endogenous sp <dig> and parp- <dig> does not change upon incubation with pj <dig>  however, and as the cells treated with pj <dig> were harvested only  <dig> hours later, we initially thought they might not have had sufficient time to alter their pattern of protein expression. we therefore conducted a new set of experiments but selected primary cultures of human skin keratinocytes  as a cellular model for parp- <dig> expression rather than parp-1+/+ cells. hsks were first exposed to h2o <dig> in order to trigger activation of endogenous parp- <dig> in these cells, and then harvested at various periods of times  for further analysis of sp <dig> dna binding and both sp <dig> and parp- <dig> expression at the protein level. as an additional control, cells triggered with h2o <dig> were also added pj <dig> at each selected time-point prior to harvesting. neither h2o <dig> nor h2o2+pj <dig> had any significant influence on the dna binding properties of sp <dig> at  <dig> h of treatment , which is also supported by the weak influence of these reagents on both sp <dig> and parp- <dig> protein expression in western blot . however, challenging parp- <dig> activity through exposure of hsks to h2o <dig> not only reduced the binding capacity of sp <dig>  in these cells at  <dig> and  <dig> h  but also translated into a reduction in the expression of both parp- <dig> and sp <dig> proteins . most interestingly, the h2o2-dependent reduction in the dna binding of both sp <dig> and sp <dig> was not solely reverted by the further addition of the parp- <dig> inhibitor pj <dig> but was even considerably improved at  <dig> h . this dramatic increase in sp <dig> dna binding also translated in an increased expression of sp <dig> at the protein level, which nearly doubled upon addition of the pj <dig> inhibitor . we therefore conclude that parp-1-dependent addition of par to sp <dig> reduces its dna binding properties and thereby alter the efficiency with which it can transcribe its target genes, which comprise the parp- <dig> gene besides from the sp <dig> gene itself.

influence of polyation on the activity directed by the rparp- <dig> promoter
most of the activity directed by the parp- <dig> gene promoter was shown to rely essentially on the recognition of multiple parp- <dig> promoter target sites by members of the sp <dig> family  <cit> . of them, sp <dig> accounted for most of the positive influence exerted on this promoter  <cit> . we demonstrated above that both expression and dna binding of sp <dig> is considerably decreased in parp-1-/- cells. we therefore examined whether this decrease would also translate into a reduced parp- <dig> promoter activity upon transfection of parp-1-/- cells with a recombinant construct bearing the cat reporter gene fused to the basal promoter from the rat parp- <dig> gene that has its three sp <dig> target sites  either kept intact  or mutated   <cit> . unexpectedly, transfection of the pcr <dig> construct into parp-1-/- cells yielded cat activities approximately 4-fold higher than in parp-1+/+ cells . consistent with these results, exposing pcr3-transfected parp-1+/+cells that express the wild type parp- <dig> protein to the parp- <dig> inhibitor pj <dig> resulted in a near 8-fold increase in basal parp promoter activity while it had no influence in parp-1-/- cells. mutating all three sp <dig> sites from the parp- <dig> promoter  dramatically reduced basal promoter activity and entirely suppressed induction of parp- <dig> promoter function in parp-1-/- cells. suppression of parp- <dig> activity with pj <dig> in parp-1+/+ cells had no influence on the activity directed by pcr3f2/f3/f4m suggesting that the regulatory influences of parp- <dig> on its own promoter are mediated through alteration of sp <dig> 

as the trans-activating properties of the par-free sp <dig> is increased in parp-1-/- cells, we then wished to determined whether the transcriptional activity directed by other gene's promoter reported to be under the regulatory influence of this transcription factor would also be similarly affected by the lack of parp- <dig> activity. we recently reported that transcription of the human α <dig> integrin subunit gene was under the positive regulatory influence of both a proximal and a distal sp <dig> site in primary cultures of rabbit corneal epithelial cells  <cit> . we therefore used a recombinant construct that bear the cat reporter gene fused to a truncated version of the α <dig> promoter that contain only the proximal sp <dig> site  for conducting this experiment. in addition, and as the gc-rich promoter from the human α <dig> integrin subunit gene was also reported to be positively regulated by sp <dig>  <cit> , a recombinant construct that has the cat gene fused to the basal promoter from the α <dig> gene  was also used in these assays. the -92α5cat and α6– <dig> constructs were therefore transfected into both the parp-1-/- and parp-1+/+ cell lines and cat activity determined and normalized. as shown on figure 8b, transfection of the parp- <dig> promoter-bearing construct pcr <dig> yielded a cat activity that was more than 4-times more elevated in parp-1-/- than in parp-1+/+ cells . interestingly, transfection of both the α <dig> and α <dig> promoter constructs also yielded increased cat activities in parp-1-/- cells , indicating that the altered regulatory influence resulting from the lack of par addition to sp <dig> in parp-1-/- cells is not merely restricted to the parp- <dig> promoter but also affect transcription of other sp1-responsive genes as well.

discussion
the ability of the parp- <dig> protein to interact with a variety of nuclear-located transcription factors and thereby alter their regulatory function toward the target genes that they regulate is certainly among the most important of the many functions parp- <dig> may play as it will ultimately alter the pattern of genes expressed by any given cell. although an increasing number of such transcription factors are being reported every year, yet only a few of them have been shown to be post-translationally modified by parp- <dig>  here we show that parp- <dig> physically associates with the positive transcription factor sp <dig> and reduces its trans-activating properties by the catalytic addition of par to this protein. we demonstrate that such a post-translational alteration of sp <dig> not only reduces the transcription of the parp- <dig> gene itself , but also that of other sp1-responsive genes, for instance those encoding the human integrin subunits α <dig> and α <dig>  based on the fact that the average branching frequency of the par is approximately one branch per linear section of 20– <dig> units of adpr  <cit> , and that adpr units have a molecular mass of  <dig> daltons, we can assume that par branching will translate in an increase of at least  <dig>  kda in the molecular mass of the acceptor protein. the unchanged apparent electrophoretic mobility of sp <dig> in western blot suggests that branching of adpr units is however unlikely to occur. this is consistent with polyation of other transcription factors, namely rap30/rap <dig> subunits of tfiif  <cit> . an analysis of the  <dig> potential polyation sites in sp <dig>  reveals that  <dig> of them are localized within the first  <dig> amino acids  whereas  <dig> are localized at the c-terminal end of the protein. most of the sites are in hydrophilic portions of the protein  and therefore available to accept par. the two last sites at position e <dig> and e <dig> are in an hydrophobic portion and might not be readily modified by par. modification by par anywhere on the protein may induce its desorption from dna. however, two potential sites  are localized within the second and third zn finger of sp <dig>  respectively. the specific targeting of these sites may be critical in negatively regulating the function of sp <dig> on specific dna sequence.

sp <dig> modification by par alters the expression of the parp- <dig> gene because of the presence of at least five distinct target sites for this transcription factor in the parp- <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . besides its action on sp <dig>  parp- <dig> has also been reported to regulate the transcription of its own gene through other regulatory mechanisms that are most likely related to the presence of secondary structures in dna. indeed, it has been shown that the dbd of parp- <dig> can repress parp- <dig> gene transcription by interacting directly with hairpin-like structures present in the promoter of the human parp- <dig> gene  <cit> . although these results may appear contradictory at first sight to those we report in this study, yet the possibility remains that the parp- <dig> truncated version they used might have caused repression of the parp- <dig> promoter through the recruitment of other transcription factors rather than through a direct action of parp- <dig> on sp <dig>  for instance, parp- <dig> has been reported to physically interact with the transcription factors tef- <dig>  b-myb and ap- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, all three transcription factors have been shown to function not only as activators but also as repressors of gene transcription  <cit> . besides, the two most likely hairpin-like structures in the human parp- <dig> promoter have been shown to be present at quite a distance from the sp <dig> target sites-bearing basal promoter . it is also worth mentioning that mutation of all three sp <dig> sites contained in the rparp- <dig> basal promoter entirely suppressed the induction of parp- <dig> promoter activity in parp-1-/- cells, a clear evidence that the parp- <dig> negative influence on its own promoter-driven transcription is entirely dependent on altering sp <dig> binding at the rparp- <dig> promoter.

addition of par to transcription factors can either promote or reduce their affinity toward their corresponding sites in dna. it has been shown that the dna binding properties of a few transcription factors, notably yy- <dig>  nfkb, creb, the tfiid subunit tbp, and presumably sp <dig>  was severely reduced in the presence of nad+  <cit> . the pattern of migration that they obtained for sp <dig> on the emsa was, however, not typical of that normally observed for this transcription factor and might have resulted either from protein degradation of the crude nuclear extracts used by these authors or from the fact that a transcription factor other than sp <dig> has bound to the gc-rich labeled probe they used for conducting their emsa. sp <dig> belongs to a large family of transcription factors, the sp/klf family, which comprises  <dig> proteins that all possess the ability to bind gc- or gt-rich target sites in dna as all of them share three similar zn-fingers as their dna binding domain  <cit> . as no supershift experiments using an anti-sp <dig> antibody were conducted in the study by oei and coworkers, care must be taken as to whether sp <dig> indeed was the transcription factor from the hela extract that actually bound their labeled probe in emsa as the shifted band might have resulted from the binding of another member from the sp/klf family to the gc-rich labeled probe they used.

the experiments that we conducted either in vitro, using purified sp <dig>  or in vivo, by inducing the parp- <dig> activity with the oxidative reagent h2o <dig>  provided evidence that addition of par to sp <dig> not only lowered its positive regulatory influence on gene transcription but also its capacity to physically interact with its high affinity target sites in dna. this exposition of cultured cells  to h2o <dig> also translated in a reduced expression of both parp- <dig> and sp <dig>  at the protein level, a process that could be reverted in a time-dependent manner by the parp inhibitor pj <dig> . it is important to note that pj <dig> has a broad range, and therefore inhibits the activity of not only parp- <dig> but other parps as well. this would include parp- <dig>  a known dna-dependent parp involved in dna damage response and repair  <cit> . however, because parp- <dig> accounts for more than 90% of cellular polyation  <cit> , it makes the contribution of parp- <dig>  or other parps, marginal on modification of sp <dig>  moreover, the use of parp-1-/- cells strongly support the in vivo role of parp- <dig> in the modulation of sp <dig> activity. that no reduction, but rather an increase in the expression of sp <dig> is seen in parp-1+/+ cells  is rather paradoxical with the results from the transfection experiments. yet, the lack of any parp- <dig> influence when all three sp <dig> sites from the parp- <dig> promoter-bearing construct pcr <dig> are mutated is a clear evidence that the primary action of parp- <dig> in wild-type parp-1+/+ cells is directed toward this transcription factor. as an interesting hypothesis, we suggest that in parp- <dig> expressing cells, most, if not all sp <dig> proteins has been added par to a certain level, which would represent a remarkable mean for the cell to restrict the otherwise very powerful trans-activating properties of sp <dig> on gene transcription. although the basal level of sp <dig> expression is decreased in parp-1-/- knockout cells whereas that of other transcription factors, such as sp <dig>  e2f <dig> and stat- <dig>  remains unaffected, it would however be free of added par and would thus become a much more potent activator of gene expression. besides reducing its trans-activating properties, addition of par to sp <dig> may also serve other cellular functions. sp <dig> has been recently reported as particularly sensitive to protein degradation in quiescent, post-confluent, but not in actively growing primary cultures of rabbit corneal epithelial cells   <cit> . monitoring the steady state level of sp <dig> in cells grown in the presence of parp- <dig> inhibitors such as 3-ab or pj <dig> in cells grown at a high cell density might prove particularly informative considering the recent demonstration that parp- <dig> contributes to the activity of the proteasome in drug-induced, oxydatively damaged nuclear proteins  <cit> . abnormally elevated expression and dna binding of sp <dig>  as for many of the sp/klf family members to which belong sp <dig>  <cit> , has been recognized as a valuable prognostic marker in both gastric  <cit>  and colorectal cancers  <cit> . parp- <dig> mediated addition of par to sp <dig> can now be viewed as one out of a few other post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, that the cell may use to modulate the positive regulatory influence of sp <dig> and thereby contribute to prevent any given cell to progress toward anchorage-independent, unregulated cell proliferation, the hallmark of all cancer cells.

although the reduced binding of sp <dig> in wild-type parp-1+/+ cells grown in the presence of the parp activator h2o <dig>  is easily explained by the capacity of parp- <dig> to add par to this transcription factor, the similar reduction observed in sp <dig> expression  and dna binding  between both wild-type parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- knockout cells remains speculative. however, the recent cloning of the human sp <dig> gene promoter raises interesting possibilities to highlight the influence the lack of parp- <dig> protein might have on the reduced expression of sp <dig> . indeed, the basal promoter of the human sp <dig> gene was found to bear target sites for multiple transcription factors, including nf-y, ap- <dig>  e2f, c/ebp as well as sp <dig> itself  <cit> . interestingly, the transcriptional activity directed by both ap- <dig> and e2f <dig> was found to be regulated by parp- <dig> activity in cultured cells. parp- <dig> apparently exerts a dual regulatory influence on ap-2α transcription with opposing effects: the middle region of the parp- <dig> protein interacts physically with ap-2α and enhance its transcription, a situation postulated to occur under normal circumstances, whereas the catalytic domain strongly polyates ap-2α and thereby reduces binding to its dna target sites, a temporary shut-off mechanism that might be used during unfavourable conditions  <cit> . on the other hand, e2f- <dig> was not found to be added par by parp- <dig> but was found to physically interact with it, which results in an improved binding of e2f- <dig> to its dna target sites and further enhances its trans-activating properties, and indicating that parp- <dig> acts as a positive co-factor of e2f-1-mediated transcription  <cit> . although binding of ap- <dig> to the sp <dig> gene promoter could not be demonstrated, e2f was found to bind and positively influence transcription of that gene  <cit> . therefore, the reduced expression of sp <dig> that we observed in parp-1-/- knockout cells may simply result from the reduced transcriptional activity of e2f- <dig>  as the sp <dig> gene has been reported to be positively regulated in a dose-dependent manner by this transcription factor  <cit>  .

besides sp <dig>  our results also demonstrated a reduced expression of the transcription factors ap- <dig> and nfi in parp-1-/- knockout cells relative to wild type in parp-1+/+ cells, whereas that of others, such as sp <dig>  e2f <dig> and stat- <dig> remained unaffected by the lack of parp- <dig> activity. that ap- <dig> expression and dna binding is strongly abrogated in parp- <dig> deficient cells is a well documented fact  <cit> . indeed, the pharmacological inhibition of parp- <dig> activity in  <dig> -dihydro-5--1-isoquinoline -treated mice entirely abolished the tpa-dependent activation and dna binding properties of ap- <dig>  <cit> . inhibition of parp- <dig> activity in rats treated with nicotinamide was found to prevent n-methyl-n-nitrosourea-induced photoreceptor apoptosis through a reduction in the expression of the ap- <dig> subunit c-jun, a process that was postulated to depend on the inhibition of the jnk/ap- <dig> signalization pathway  <cit> . parp- <dig> activity was recently shown to be required for c-jun phosphorylation, a process that modulate the stability of ap- <dig> and determines its dna binding efficiency  <cit> . dna binding of nfi was found to be strongly abrogated in the parp-1-/- knockout cells. these alterations in the dna binding properties of nfi also correlated with important changes in the pattern of nfi protein electrophoretic mobility on sds gels that might result either from the expression of distinct nfi isoforms, or from post-translational modifications of nfi that may differ between the wild-type parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- knockout cells. to our knowledge, no study has ever reported such a suppression of the nfi dna binding properties in parp-1-/- knockout cells. we previously demonstrated that nfi has a negative influence on the activity directed by the rparp- <dig> promoter but not because it possesses any intrinsic repressor function but rather because it competes with sp <dig> for the availability of a promoter composite element that bears overlapping target sites for both these transcription factors  <cit> . interestingly, members from the nfi family have been reported to be as efficient as repressors  <cit>  than activators  <cit>  of gene transcription. besides, nfi sites have often been shown to be located close to, or overlapping with nearby sp <dig> sites. indeed, nfi was reported to interact with and antagonize sp <dig>  which result in the down-regulation of the platelet-derived growth factor -a gene expression  <cit> . we recently reported that a similar interference of sp <dig> action by nfi might also account for the transcriptional repression of the p <dig> genes  <cit> . the physiological significance of nfi suppression in the parp-1-/- knockout cells has yet to be precisely determined, although one would predict that its suppression would tend to favor the positive influence of the potentiated action of sp <dig> that results from its lack of par addition.

CONCLUSIONS
parp- <dig> clearly contributes in a positive fashion to initiation of gene transcription by inducing local relaxation of the otherwise condensed chromatin by the attachment of par to the histones h <dig>  h2a and h2b . the recent demonstration that parp- <dig> is closely associated to the enzyme topoisomerase iiβ  further stressed the contribution of parp- <dig> in the initiation of gene transcription as topoiiβ, through its ability to create double-strand breaks in dna, also provides a mean to activate parp- <dig> enzymatic activity as well. our results demonstrate that besides its positive action on gene transcription, parp- <dig> may as well contribute to suppression of gene expression by its ability to add par to the strong transcriptional activator sp <dig>  thereby establishing a dual regulatory function  for this protein in gene expression.
