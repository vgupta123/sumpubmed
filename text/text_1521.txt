BACKGROUND
soy food has been taken as a functional food because it contains many health beneficial molecules such as isoflavones
 <cit> . studies on human nutrition have shown that soybean isoflavones play an important role in preventing a number of chronic diseases
 <cit> . equally, isoflavones are critical factors in defending soybean crops against pests
 <cit> , in promoting nodulation by rhizobia
 <cit> , and in changing or adjusting the microorganisms around plant roots
 <cit> . the major bioactive components of soybean isoflavones in human nutrition are daidzein , genistein  and glycitein . isoflavone contents in soybean seed are inherited as complex quantitative traits
. since soy seed isoflavones are regulated by multiple genetic factors, their concentrations in seed are highly variable
. over fifty qtls underlying individual and/or total soybean isoflavone content have been reported
. however, only  <dig> of these qtls were in genomic regions encoding isoflavone synthesis enzymes.

a group of enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway lead to the biosynthesis of dz, gt and gc
 <cit> . phenylalanine ammonia lyase , chalcone synthase  and flavanone 3-hydroxylase 
 <cit>  are the first three enzymes that convert the amino acid phenylalanine into p-coumaroyl-coa in this pathway
 <cit> . in the isoflavonoid biosynthetic pathway
 <cit> , the co-catalytic action of chs
 <cit>  with chalcone reductase 
 <cit>  produces isoliquiritigenin and naringenin chalcone, which are isomers of the central isoflavanone intermediates naringenin and liquiritigenin, respectively. isoliquiritigenin and naringenin chalcone are respectively converted into liquiritigenin and naringenin by chalcone isomerase 
 <cit> . these two products are the precursors of dz and gt, which are formed after the catalysis of the precursors by the key enzyme 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase 
 <cit> . the enzyme f3h, that competes with ifs in utilizing naringenin, catalyzes the conversion of flavanones to dihydroflavonols, which are intermediates in the biosynthesis of flavonols, anthocyanidins, catechins and proanthocyanidins
 <cit> . for the synthesis of gc, isoliquiritigenin is likely a precursor to form gc after several biochemical steps, which are not entirely known yet
 <cit> . however, seed isoflavone concentrations in soybean can be regulated by metabolic engineering of the complex phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways
 <cit> .

regulating transcript abundance is an effective approach to improve phenotypes
 <cit> . the integrated analysis of genotype and transcript abundance data for association with complex traits can be used to identify novel genetic pathways involved in complex traits. ‘expression qtl’ , first defined by jansen and nap
 <cit> , could identify the genetic determinants of transcript abundances and is widely used for investigating gene regulation pathways. this approach treats transcript abundance of individual genes as quantitative traits in a segregating population. the eqtl map information enables genetic regulatory networks to be modeled that can provide a better understanding of the underlying phenotypic variation. it has been successfully applied in humans
, plants
, yeasts
 <cit> , worms
 <cit> , flies
 <cit> , mice
 <cit> , pigs
 <cit>  and rats
 <cit>  populations. these studies showed that transcript abundance was highly heritable and could be linked to either a local locus  or a distant locus . cis-eqtl is mapped to the same genomic location like an expressed gene , and trans-eqtl is mapped to a different genomic location from an expressed gene 
 <cit> . in general, cis-eqtl tends to produce stronger statistical associations than does by trans-eqtl
 <cit> . this phenomenon is regarded as evidence of greater biological plausibility for the existence of true functional cis-eqtl
 <cit> . trans-eqtl could occur individually at a single genomic locus or could occur collectively as part of eqtl trans-bands
 <cit> . this genomics approach has been employed to identify eqtl related genes in soybean
. to date, no information concerning eqtls underlying soybean isoflavone synthetic enzyme genes is available.

it has been proved that many enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway underlie qtls that determine the accumulation of isoflavone contents in soybean seeds
 <cit> . meanwhile, the modification of enzyme encoded genes that are involved in phenylpropanoid pathway could promote the biosynthesis of isoflavone
 <cit> . in this study, pal, chs, ifs and f3h in the phenylpropanoid pathway were selected as the target genes  to analyze isoflavone-relative eqtl. potential candidate genes underlying the accumulation of isoflavone contents in soybean seed were also evaluated. in addition, overlapped loci both for eqtl and phenotypic qtl  were identified.

RESULTS
total and individual isoflavone contents, target gene transcript abundance and correlation analysis
transcript abundances of target genes  between parents from r <dig> to r <dig> developmental stages were compared. total and individual isoflavone contents and transcript abundances of tgs at r <dig> stage of soybean development were measured in the f5: <dig> population. the results showed that significant differences among the transcript abundances of tgs between the two parents existed at the r <dig> stage. the phenotypic variation of individual and total isoflavones showed a continuous distribution .table  <dig>

discussion
soybean isoflavones have been broadly used in food, medicine, cosmetics and animal husbandry
 <cit> . increasing and decreasing seed isoflavone content will be an important target of soybean breeding. mas based on genotype selection rather than solely on phenotype selection provides additional power for the selections during soybean breeding
 <cit> . cultivar ‘zhongdou 27’ proved to have high-isoflavone content  as reported previously
 <cit> . meng et al.
 <cit>  identified two qtl underlying resistance to soybean aphid through leaf isoflavone-mediated antibiosis in soybean cultivar ‘zhongdou 27’. a number of pqtls associated with seed isoflavone were identified in multiple environments from cultivar ‘zhongdou 27’ using  <dig> ssr markers . therefore, ‘zhongdou 27’ should be given more attention as an elite germplasm to improve soybean seed isoflavone concentration, disease and pest resistances.

in our previous studies, some identified qtls associated with individual/total isoflavone contents showed higher contribution to phenotypic variation. some specific copies of genes  in the phenylpropanoid pathway were near or falling into these quantitative trait loci by browsing the reference genome sequence of williams  <dig> .

to investigate the regulation mechanism of isoflavone synthetic enzyme genes, the transcript abundances of pal, chs, ifs and f3h in the mapping population were examined, and the genomic regions affecting the expression of the tgs were identified using the eqtl methodology
 <cit> . a global microarray eqtl analysis of a limited number of samples can be used for exploring functional and regulatory gene networks and for scanning cis-eqtl, whereas the subsequent analysis of a subset of likely cis-regulated genes by real-time rt-pcr in a larger number of samples may identify qtl region by targeting these positional candidate genes
 <cit> . in this study, real-time pcr reactions were used to analyze the transcript abundance variations of the four tgs in the f5: <dig> ri lines.

when combined with classical qtl phenotypes, correlation analysis can directly provide an overview of potential genes underlying isoflavone traits
 <cit> . through the comparison of the transcript abundances of the four tgs , the parents  showed different patterns at the r <dig> stage. this observation was consistent with the previous report by sarah et al.
 <cit> . significant correlations between the transcript abundances of tgs and isoflavone contents were found in developing seeds at the r <dig> stage, indicating that these genes could affect total and individual isoflavone accumulations .

previously, two major qtls that affect isoflavone content across multiple environments were mapped on gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  by gutierrez et al.
 <cit>  and yang et al.
 <cit> , respectively. in the present work, one eqtl qifsa2_ <dig>  was mapped close to qgca2_ <dig> on gm <dig>  . this result suggested that qifsa2_ <dig> might be a cis-enzyme related locus. some of these identified eqtls associated with seed isoflavone content did not coincide with the tgs, suggesting that the differences in tgs transcript abundances might be caused by several trans-acting factors

in this study, since the  <dig> markers were not uniformly distributed, large gaps appeared with low marker density on chromosomes gm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  implying that more markers should be developed among these gaps and the authenticity of pqtl or eqtl should be further clarified. among these gaps, special attention should be paid to eqtl qf3hdlb_ <dig> on chromosome gm <dig> and qifsc1_ <dig> on chromosome gm <dig> because of their higher lod score and contribution to phenotypic variation . overlapped loci of qf3hf_ <dig> and qdzf_ <dig>  and genes that fall into this region should also be further clarified with more markers. consequently, fine mapping on these intervals with more ssr or snp markers and to determine the authenticity of these loci as well as the underlying genes were extremely essential in the future work.

the analysis of eqtl overlapped with pqtl suggested that the candidate genes or elements among the marker intervals could affect phenotypic traits
 <cit> . therefore, overlapped loci of eqtls and pqtls were analyzed to find the potential candidate genes affecting the accumulation of isoflavone contents in soybean seed. five eqtl intervals were overlapped with pqtls according to the comparison of genomic regions between pqtls and eqtls . these results indicated that some candidate genes or elements in these intervals could regulate the biosynthesis of isoflavone components, and affect their accumulation. additionally, some eqtls overlapped with other eqtls or shared the same markers with pqtls, suggesting that some candidate genes or elements were located near these loci.

several genes involved in isoflavone accumulation in soybean seed had been identified
 <cit> .  <dig> candidate genes falling into the overlapped intervals of pqtl and eqtl were found . bolon et al.
 <cit>  identified eqtl for genes with seed-specific expression and discovered striking eqtl hotspots at distinct genomic intervals on chromosome gm <dig>  a chalcone isomerase  and ifs <dig> gene were located in the same region identified by qgen <dig> on gm13
 <cit> . another qtl for gc that encoded pal and 4cl paralog was also reported on gm13
 <cit> . in the present work, seven candidate genes on gm <dig>  were identified, implying that there could be a hotspot of gene cluster that regulated seed isoflavone content on gm <dig>  among them, chs  and fls  were identified on three overlapped loci, implying that they could interact or trans-regulate other genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. furthermore, pal <dig>  and ifs  paralogs were identified within two overlapped loci. in the marker interval  associated with qchsf_ <dig>  qifsf_ <dig> and qgtf_ <dig>  both glyma13g <dig>  and glyma13g <dig>  were found to encode chs and ifs, indicating that they could be the potential candidate genes. it was supposed that glyma13g <dig>  could interact or trans-regulate the expression of ifs. however, the function of these potential candidate genes should be tested in future works.

although open questions about the biology and applications of eqtl mapping still exist
 <cit> , there are considerable advances in the eqtl studies. detailed analysis of eqtl combined with cluster analysis of transcript abundance and eventually gene expression patterns could assist map-based cloning of genes underlying these traits. markers based on underlying genes are also desirable for mas in soybean breeding programs. the mechanism underlying seed isoflavone synthesis and its accumulation may contribute to the development of marker-assisted selection for soybean cultivars with high or low isoflavone contents.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of thirty three eqtls  were identified on fifteen chromosomes. five eqtl intervals were overlapped with pqtls and a total of eleven candidate genes within the overlapped eqtl and pqtl were identified. these results might be beneficial for the development of marker-assisted selection to breed soybean cultivars with high isoflavone contents.
