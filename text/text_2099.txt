BACKGROUND
bistability is key for understanding basic phenomena of cellular functioning, such as decision-making processes in cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and apoptosis  <cit> . it is also involved in loss of cellular homeostasis associated with early events in cancer onset  <cit>  and in prion diseases  <cit> . a recent review discussed different bistability phenomena in bacteria, such as different phenotypes in clonal populations being important for the origin of new species  <cit> .

bistable switches are typically enabled by positive feedback loops in signal transduction networks. here a sufficiently strong  signal switches on a self-amplifying process leading to expression of the corresponding target genes. due to the corresponding hysteresis effect this process can retain its activity without a persistent signal. such switches are therefore called 'decision-making'. one often discussed example is the restriction point control for the regulation of g1-s transition of the mammalian cell cycle, where recently a detailed small ordinary differential equation  model was presented  <cit> . the g2-m transition was also described as a toggle-switch  <cit> . oocyte maturation is an example for the involvement of a bistable system in cell differentiation  <cit> . biochemical switches have also been found in nutrient utilization in bacteria  <cit> , mating response in yeast  <cit> , and synaptic memory processing  <cit> . interestingly, just quite small parts of the large signal transduction systems  can already induce bistability. this was demonstrated for the epidermal growth factor receptor system  <cit>  and other kinase phosphatase systems  <cit> .

given its outstanding biological importance, it is clear that bistable switches also attracted the attention of theoretical biologists. a frequently discussed problem is the necessary  condition for bistability. the central result goes back to the work of clarke  <cit>  and thomas  <cit> : autonomous differential systems can possess multiple steady states only under the presence of positive feedback loops  <cit> . it was also argued that the feedback needs 'some type of non-linearity' or 'ultrasensitivity' for inducing bistability  <cit> . different types of ultrasensitivity have been discussed  <cit> , but formulated in the most general manner that means the system needs some mechanism for filtering out small stimuli to enable a stable 'off' state  <cit> . feinberg's chemical reaction network theory  even gives necessary and sufficient conditions for bistability, by restricting to special mass-action kinetic  systems  <cit> . in a recent application example a single layer of a mapk cascade was studied and the region in parameter space being relevant for bistability was analytically described  <cit> . however, for larger systems crnt leads to cumbersome calculations, but the applicability could recently be improved by just studying important subnetworks  <cit>  which are based on the concept of elementary flux modes  <cit> .

another approach for identifying necessary structural conditions for any dynamic behaviour is the identification of the corresponding minimal systems. such systems have the advantage of being "simple enough to understand at an intuitive level"  <cit>  and are well suited for different basic studies. for instance, the lotka-volterra system  <cit> , the higgins-selkov-oscillator  <cit> , and the "brusselator"  <cit>  have been studied extensively. some years ago we identified the smallest chemical system with hopf bifurcation  <cit> . minimal mak systems are summarized in table  <dig>  recently, different 'smallest' or 'minimal' bistable systems for cell polarity  <cit>  and g protein signalling  <cit>  have been presented, as well as 'the smallest multistationary mass-preserving chemical reaction network'  <cit> . however, these systems are still too large to represent a minimal bistable system according to definition . many different reaction topologies with  <dig> and  <dig> molecules have also been analysed computationally for the possibility of bistability  <cit> . although this type of bistability detection may miss some bistable systems, the authors found nevertheless many topologies with switching behaviour . the identified 'minimal' system contained  <dig> variables  and  <dig> reactions. the bistable one-dimensional schloegl system  <cit>  contains trimolecular reactions and can therefore not represent a realistic elementary chemical system. elementary chemical reactions are at most bimolecular.

s and p denote constant substrates and products.

here we present and discuss the smallest bistable chemical reaction system. application of our previously presented instability causing structure analysis  leads to additional insight into system functioning.

RESULTS
the smallest bistable chemical reaction system
we define the smallest chemical system  by the following criteria in decreasing order of importance:

   

according to this definition, the following bistable system is unique .

   

assuming spatially homogeneous conditions, the system can be described by the two-component mass-action kinetic ode system :

   

due to its simplicity, the mathematical analysis of the system is simple as well. the system has two elementary flux modes  <cit> , following directly from the two nullspace vectors of the corresponding stoichiometric matrix

   

one mode uses reactions 1- <dig>  and the other reactions  <dig> , and  <dig>  bistability can, of course, only arise if all reactions are active. introducing dimensionless quantities  → k <dig>  k3/k <dig> → k <dig>  k4/ → k <dig>  tk2c → t), we set k <dig> =  <dig>  without restriction of generality . the system has three steady states: , , with the discriminant d = k <dig> - 4k3k <dig>  a saddle-node bifurcation occurs at d =  <dig>  the three steady states are real if d >  <dig>  the second and third steady state is always positive.

generally, in two-component systems a steady state is locally stable if the trace tr and determinant det of the jacobian at this point are negative and positive, respectively . if the corresponding determinant is negative, the steady state is a saddle point. it can be seen from the jacobian  that its trace is always negative  is confined to the positive part of the phase space). this excludes hopf bifurcations  and it means the system is dissipative, i.e. phase-space contracting all over the phase space . the determinants of the jacobian at the three steady states read k1k <dig>  , and , respectively. therefore, the first and third steady state are always locally stable, the second is always locally unstable, a saddle-point . simple calculation shows further that 4det <tr <dig> at the first and third steady state, so these are always stable nodes.

for k <dig> =  <dig>  k <dig> =  <dig>  k <dig> =  <dig>  the second and third steady state are  and , respectively. figure  <dig> shows a corresponding signal-response curve, also called bifurcation diagram  <cit> . the signal is the concentration of the constant outer substance s , the response is the steady state concentration of an internal reactant, here x. the saddle-node bifurcation occurs at s = 3/ <dig>  beyond that point the system has two stable steady states. it follows from  that  , so the real dynamic behaviour of the system is that of a toggle-switch : for sufficiently large k <dig> small fluctuations in the concentrations would drive the system to the positive steady state .

the instability causing structure analysis  of system 
recently we presented a new method for topological network analysis of dynamical systems, the instability causing structure analysis . standard stoichiometric network analyses  are based on the assumption of steady states and lead to linear constraints in flux space. icsa is a nonlinear network analysis. it is based on the assumption of locally stable steady states. the additional demand for local stability yields additional nonlinear constraints for the steady state flux space  <cit> .

icsa needs no knowledge about kinetic details. it can be applied to chemical systems where just the stoichiometric matrix is known  or to signal transduction/gene regulatory networks represented by interaction graphs  <cit>  . icsa leads to additional insight into system functioning by identifying all contained feedback loops and all the corresponding instability causing structures . an ics is either a single feedback loop or a special combination of feedback loops  <cit> . icsa yields a necessary condition for local instability of any steady state of the system: if there is no ics all potential steady states are locally stable. for two-dimensional systems this also implies that the system has just one steady state .

we apply icsa for additional analysis of system . the stoichiometric matrix s is given in . multiplication of s with the reaction velocity substrates ector   v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> )t leads to . differentiation yields the general jacobian jg  of system :

   

where the indices x and y denote the corresponding partial differentiation. the off-diagonal elements represent the fundamental activating and inhibiting interactions in the system: the positive v2x in jg <dig> shows that x activates y by the second reaction, and equivalently for the two terms in jg <dig> : v1y → y activates x by the first reaction, - v3y → y inhibits x by the third reaction. figure  <dig> shows the corresponding interaction  graph summarizing these interactions. interaction graphs can often be found in the biological literature and corresponding databases chemical systems  and such interaction graphs.

the system contains one positive and one negative feedback loop. the positive loop is the necessary structural condition for bistability  <cit> . the second often discussed ingredient for bistability is any mechanism for filtering out small stimuli to make the off-state stable. ferrell and xiong  <cit>  discussed different such mechanisms, as ultrasensitivity and back reaction saturation. our system has the simplest mechanism to stabilize the off-state: the monomolecular efflux reaction  <dig>  analysis shows that without this reaction the second  steady state merges with the zero off-state making it  unstable. in fact, figure  <dig>  shows that it is the linear degradation term that makes the overall degradation rate higher then production for low x concentrations.

system  is the minimal chemical reaction system with bistability. therefore, any ingredient is essential. that also means, without the negative loop  this system cannot be bistable. in fact, the negative feedback prevents explosion of the system: without reaction  <dig> the system has just one locally stable off-state and one unstable positive steady state. figure  <dig> shows that without the cubic term there are just two crossings of the rate curves.

summarizing, system  contains the three different necessary conditions for bistability:  a positive feedback loop,  a mechanism for filtering out small stimuli, and  a mechanism for preventing explosion. interestingly, the third condition lacks discussion in the literature  <cit> . moreover, these three conditions can be related to the three degradation terms in the balance equation of x and so to the last three of the four reactions in . the first reaction represents the production of the system, it is the only input. the second reaction closes the positive feedback cycle. reactions three and four are degradation reactions. the third is the main degradation for higher concentrations, it prevents explosion. the fourth reaction filters out the small stimuli.

the first step in the general icsa procedure is the analysis of feedback cycles resulting from the off-diagonal terms of the general jacobian. the second step is the identification of the topological structures that actually cause instability. as mentioned above, standard local stability analysis of two-component systems needs consideration of the jacobian's trace and determinant det. in icsa we study the general jacobian. it follows from  that the trace is always negative and det = v2x v3y + v1y . the only negative term in det comprises reactions  <dig> and  <dig>  so this positive feedback cycle is the only ics of the system. the negative feedback cycle cannot cause any instability here.

discussion
the minimal bistable chemical reaction system  is based on definition . this definition is based on a chemical/physical point of view, but other definitions might also be possible. the definition for the smallest chemical reaction system with hopf bifurcation  <cit> , for instance, was more mathematically motivated: here minimal number of quadratic terms in the odes had a higher priority than minimal number of reactions. so far it has not been clear whether any at most bimolecular 3-variable system with only four  reactions and hopf bifurcation exists. meanwhile we found a corresponding system  which has a supercritical hopf bifurcation . this might be the minimal chemical reaction system with sustained oscillations according to definition .

interestingly, system  is similar to a previously presented "minimal reaction network"  <cit>  modelling activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor . our  equation resembles the balance equation of the phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase  and  is similar to the differential equation for active protein tyrosine phosphatase.

bistable systems play important roles also beyond biology. they are usually depicted by the mechanical example of a ball rolling into two different valley basins. bistable chemical systems, in particular, have been studied extensively to analyse relaxation kinetics  <cit> , non-equilibrium thermodynamics  <cit> , stochastic resonance  <cit> , as well as climate change  <cit> .

positive feedback is clearly associated with bi/multistability. negative feedback, in contrast, is often discussed in the context of oscillations  <cit> , and we recently conjectured that this is indeed a necessary condition for  oscillations  <cit> . however, this contradicts statements as "sustained oscillations can occur in models based on positive or negative feedback"  <cit> . obviously, different understandings of feedback exist. we suggest to use the general jacobian jg  it is given in ) for a simple definition of feedback: if the jg terms close any cycles, then feedback exists ), otherwise not. analysis of jg guarantees a unique identification of all in a system contained feedback cycles. goldbeter  <cit>  mentioned different examples where the oscillations should be based on a positive feedback, such as glycolytic, ca2+, and camp oscillations. however, a more detailed analysis of these systems shows that a negative feedback  is always contained . an example is the simplest model for glycolytic oscillations, the higgins-selkov oscillator : the corresponding general jacobian is . its trace and determinant are v2y - v2x - v3y and v2xv3y, respectively. obviously, v2y in jg <dig> is the only instability causing term , so the second reaction is the only ics in the system. however, inspection of the off-diagonal elements of jg reveals a negative feedback as well: the larger x, the larger becomes y, but the larger y, the smaller becomes x. the same is realised in the bistable system , where the positive feedback is the only ics and another negative feedback is contained. these examples show how the analysis of the general jacobian helps clarifying the discussion of feedback loops.

we have shown that a mechanism for preventing explosions is a third necessary condition for bistability . in system  this is achieved by a negative feedback. other bistable systems contain negative feedbacks as well , so we hypothesize that this is indeed a typical feature of bistable systems. interestingly, also oscillating systems typically contain  a positive feedback . thus, oscillating and bistable systems are practically based on the same set of feedback cycles.

CONCLUSIONS
bi/multistability and oscillations are the two most important dynamic phenomena in biology. limit cycle oscillations are associated with biological clocks and cell signalling  <cit> , and spatial oscillations with proper cell division  <cit> . the fundamental importance of bistability is discussed in the introduction. some years ago we presented the smallest chemical system with limit cycles  <cit> . here we have derived the smallest chemical system with bistability .

minimal systems are well suited for basic studies and for teaching purposes. this explains the great success of, for instance, the lotka-volterra  <cit>  and the higgins-selkov system  <cit> . we have demonstrated for the minimal chemical reaction system with hopf bifurcation  <cit>  that it is accessible for detailed mathematic-analytical examination  <cit>  and a good example system for thermodynamic considerations  <cit> . we hope that also the minimal chemical system with bistability will serve for such purposes in the future.
