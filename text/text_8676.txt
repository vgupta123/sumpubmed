BACKGROUND
food allergy is serious health concern, affecting approximately 1-2% adults and 6-8% children  <cit> . allergies to egg white and cow's milk are most common among children, whereas the most severe form of the food allergy is induced by peanuts  <cit> . food allergy is typically considered an ige-mediated type i hypersensitivity reaction  <cit> . although increased production of ige and th <dig> cytokines  are considered common markers of food allergy  <cit> , absence of ige or increased levels of th <dig> cytokines  have also been observed in several instances of food allergy  <cit> , mainly in response to cow's milk  <cit> . several animal studies have demonstrated that the involvement of the th <dig> signaling pathway is too simplistic to explain the mechanism of food allergies, since combined involvement of th <dig> and th <dig> signaling pathways have also been demonstrated  <cit> . such uncertainty over the th1/th <dig> paradigm emphasizes the need for further research to unravel the molecular mechanism of food allergy.

although a genetic basis for ige-mediated conditions such as asthma has been well documented,  <cit> , little is known about the specific genes involved in the pathogenesis of food allergy. a study by de jonge et al. investigated the mesenteric lymph node  gene expression profiles of brown-norway  rats that were challenged with peanut extract, and they identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  <cit> ; the mlns were ideal tissue for studying the mechanisms of food allergy because they provide a unique cellular and cytokine environment that is conducive to efficient antigen trapping and presentation to t-cells, the activation and proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes, and memory cell development  <cit> . in another study cardoso et al. reported significant up-regulation of the gata- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α, and il- <dig> genes in the intestine of c57bl/ <dig> mice sensitized with peanut extract and challenged with peanut seeds  <cit> . although these differentially expressed genes may be potential risk factor candidates for peanut allergy, the induction of these genes may not necessarily be involved in the immune response to other food allergens. recent studies indicate that foxp3+ t regulatory cells may play a protective role in food allergy, and foxp <dig> is considered an immunophenotype marker of t regulatory cells. in a recent report krogulska et al.  <cit>  suggested a possible protective role of foxp <dig> and il- <dig> in food allergy, where the expression of these genes was up-regulated in children who were developing tolerance to allergenic foods. another recent report however, contradict to such tolerogenic effects of foxp <dig> in food allergy, where foxp <dig> along with nfat-c <dig>  il- <dig> and gata- <dig> genes were reported to up-regulated in children with persisting cow's milk allergy  <cit> . such conflicting reports make it difficult to identify reliable biomarkers of food allergy. therefore, it is necessary to continue further research to identify other biomarkers of food allergy.

a number of different animal models have been used to study food allergy  <cit> . mice, however, are the most widely used model, and this is in part because immunological and molecular tools and reagents for this species are readily available. also, their short breeding cycle and smaller size make them a cost effective model for conducting allergy research  <cit> . of the different murine strains that are available, the balb/c strain has been typically preferred over other strains because of its high ige response that is characteristic of an atopic phenotype  <cit> .

a suitable route of exposure is critical for studying the allergenicity of food proteins. sensitization by intra-gastric  gavage has been used by several groups  <cit> , although there is a potential risk of developing oral tolerance via this route  <cit> . adjuvants, such as cholera toxin, have also been used during oral sensitization, however, eliciting an immune response via this approach may not necessarily mimic the allergic response in humans  <cit> , and may lead to misinterpretation of the data due to hyperstimulation of the immune system  <cit> . in order to avoid the development of tolerance and use of adjuvants, systemic exposure by intraperitoneal  injection has been used by many groups, and this has been reported to be reliable and effective method for inducing sensitization  <cit> .

in the following study, the transcriptome profile of mln from balb/c mice was assessed using cdna microarrays to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to i.p. sensitization with three common food allergens of varying potency; cow's milk β-lactoglobulin  < hen's egg ovalbumin  < peanut agglutinin   <cit> . the sensitization concentrations of the antigens used in this study were shown to be sufficient to elicit type i allergic reactions during a subsequent challenge. the results presented here in this study may help to establish a method in future to identify the potential allergenicity of other food proteins. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the mln transcriptome profile of balb/c mice in response to blg, ova and pna sensitization.

RESULTS
differential gene expression profiling by cdna microarray analysis
analysis of the differentially expressed genes was carried out on the mln of balb/c mice sensitized with common food antigens of varying allergenic potencies. these mlns were collected  <dig> h after the second sensitization. analysis of blg sensitized mice revealed  <dig> differentially expressed genes with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the ova sensitized group ;  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated. finally, in pna sensitized animals,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed ;  <dig> genes being up-regulated and  <dig> genes being down-regulated. the number of common and uniquely expressed genes for each antigen sensitization is indicated in figure  <dig>  a complete list of genes that were differentially expressed in response to blg, ova and pna sensitization is provided in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes were commonly expressed in all of the blg, ova, and pna sensitized groups . top  <dig> of these common differentially expressed genes are summarized in table  <dig>  as expected, sensitization with pbs did not have any significant effect on mln gene expression.

gene ontology  analysis
genes that were significantly differentially expressed in response to antigen sensitization were further analyzed to understand their biological relevance and molecular functions. a total of  <dig> go biological processes were identified as significantly enriched with the genes from blg sensitized group  . from these  <dig> biological processes, approximately  <dig> processes were directly related with immune or inflammatory response. some of these immune response related biological processes with high percent  enrichment includes b cell receptor signaling pathway , regulation of immunoglobulin mediated immune response , antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via mhc class ii  and regulation of phagocytosis  . genes differentially expressed in response to ova sensitization enriched  <dig> go biological processes  , of which at least  <dig> processes were related with immune or hypersensitivity response. some of these immune or hypersensitivity related processes high percent  enrichment includes mast cell homeostasis , fc receptor mediated stimulatory signaling pathway , eosinophil activation , complement activation, alternative pathway , regulation of b cell mediated immunity  and hypersensitivity  . finally, go analysis with the genes differentially expressed in response to pna sensitization enriched  <dig> biological processes  . among these  <dig> biological processes, approximately  <dig> processes were immune or hypersensitivity related including regulation of interleukin- <dig> production , mast cell homeostasis , regulation of vasoconstriction , regulation of b cell mediated immunity , regulation of acute inflammatory response  and hypersensitivity  . comparison of the go biological processes among allergen sensitized groups revealed a total of  <dig> overlapping biological processes commonly enriched  in response to blg, ova and pna sensitizations . further analysis revealed that almost 48% of these common processes  were related to immune or hypersensitivity responses . two common differentially expressed genes, fc receptor, ige, high affinity i, gamma polypeptide  and complement component  <dig>  played a central role for the enrichment of the majority of these hypersensitivity or immune responsive biological processes . other genes that were involved in the enrichment of these common go biological processes include immunoglobulin joining chain , keratin  <dig> , scinderin , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , supervillin  and villin  <dig>  .

go analysis also revealed the molecular functions of the differentially expressed genes. a total of seven go molecular functions were commonly enriched with the genes from blg, ova and pna sensitized groups . among these molecular functions calcium ion binding  enriched with the highest number of genes from either blg, ova or pna sensitized groups. actin binding  is another significant commonly enriched molecular function; similar actin filament related processes were also observed to be enriched in go biological process category .

validation of the differentially expressed genes by real-time rt-pcr
differential expression of  <dig> representative genes from the microarray experiment was validated by real-time rt-pcr. these seven genes were selected based on their previous known relation with allergy, fold change, and p-values. these genes included stard <dig> , igj , timp <dig> , cd79a , itgb <dig> , pex <dig>  and syt <dig>  . the corresponding real-time rt-pcr and microarray fold changes in gene expression were highly correlated for all of the seven validated genes , as indicated by spearman's rank correlation rho value of  <dig>  .

topical ear challenges
the ear swelling response was measured in balb/c mice to assess the type i hypersensitivity response induced by the food allergens. all mice that were sensitized and challenged with 2% blg, 2% ova or  <dig> % pna responded significantly with an ear swelling response when compared to mice that received only pbs, or were challenged only with antigen . linear and quadratic contrasts revealed that the ear swelling among mice that were sensitized and challenged with blg, ova and pna antigens increased significantly at all time points . the peak ear swelling was recorded at  <dig> h post challenge and the response was gradually deceased over time . figure  <dig> indicates ear swelling response only at  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> h post-challenge. the ear swelling responses were not significantly different among antigen treatments .

total serum igg <dig> and ige response to sensitization and topical challenge
immunogenicity and allergenicity of each antigen was evaluated by measuring changes in total serum igg <dig> and ige concentrations respectively  <dig> h post challenge. total igg <dig> concentrations in mice that were sensitized and challenged with blg, ova or pna increased when compared to mice that received pbs alone, or were challenged only with antigens . total ige concentrations in the serum were also significantly increased in animals that had been sensitized and challenged with blg and pna when compared to mice that received only pbs or were challenged with antigen, alone . concentrations of ige in the ova treated mice were also increased, but statistical significance was not achieved after bonferroni's correction . igg <dig> and ige concentrations were not significantly different among antigen treatments.

plasma histamine concentrations in antigen sensitized and i.p. challenged mice
plasma histamine concentrations were measured as an indicator of mast cell degranulation in balb/c mice that had been sensitized and challenged with blg, ova or pna. elevated plasma histamine concentrations were observed in ova and pna sensitized and challenged mice, when compared to mice that received only pbs . histamine concentrations were also increased in mice from the blg treatment, however, this did not reach statistical significance . histamine concentrations among antigen treatment groups were significantly different .

passive cutaneous anaphylaxis  reaction
a pca assay was carried out to evaluate the antigen-specific ige response in balb/c mice that had been sensitized and challenged with blg, ova or pna. results from pca assay indicated that antigen-specific serum from previously exposed mice was sufficient to elicit a type i hypersensitivity response in naïve mice . seventy five percent of mice that received blg or ova-specific anti-serum had a positive pca response, whereas 100% mice that received pna specific anti-serum had a positive pca response . as expected, none of the mice in any of the control groups had any positive pca reaction.

discussion
in this study, balb/c mice were used as a model of food allergy in order to analyze the mln transcriptome profiles to explore the molecular mechanism associated with sensitization to three of the most common food allergens; blg, ova and pna. analysis of ear swelling, plasma histamine, total igg <dig> and ige concentrations, and antigen-specific ige level  indicated that balb/c mice developed a type i allergic response to these food allergens. these immunological profiles also indicate that the initial exposure doses without any adjuvants were sufficient to induce allergen sensitization in balb/c mice.

although the ear swelling response is typically used to assess contact allergy   <cit> , tape-stripping prior to topical antigenic challenge enabled us to use this endpoint to measure a type i hypersensitivity response. massive ear swelling was observed as early as  <dig> min post challenge and peaked  <dig> h post challenge. such rapid swelling is characteristic of ige-mediated mast cell degranulation, a hallmark of a type i allergic response  <cit> . the ear swelling test also proved to be sensitive and was able to differentiate the potencies of the antigens that used in this study. for example, the ear swelling data demonstrated that pna was more potent than blg and ova for eliciting a type i allergic response. the concentration of pna solution  that used in this study was  <dig> times less than the concentrations used for blg and ova solution , yet the magnitude of ear swelling observed in pna sensitized and challenged mice was not significantly different to that observed in blg or ova sensitized and challenged mice . these results demonstrate that this method is capable of differentiating the antigen potency and also able to generate reliable quantitative data for assessing the magnitude a type i allergic response.

ige antibodies are known to play a central role in mediating type i hypersensitivity reactions. in our study, increased production of ige in balb/c mice sensitized and challenged with blg, ova or pna illustrates that these mice experienced a ige mediated type i allergic reaction. in order to confirm that balb/c mice used in this study had an ige mediated type i allergic response and anaphylaxis, plasma histamine concentrations were measured. in this study, rapid release of histamine within  <dig> min of the i.p. challenge confirmed the induction of type i allergic response and subsequent degranulation of mast cells. traditionally, it was believed that food allergy-related systemic anaphylaxis was only due to the interaction between ige and fcεri on the mast cell surface, and this lead to mast cell degranulation and the subsequent release of histamines and other enzymes  <cit> . reports, however, suggest that an alternate pathway exists that is dependent on the interaction of igg <dig> and fcγriii  <cit> . mouse fcγriii is a low affinity receptor, present on the surface of the macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells that binds to igg <dig>  binding of soluble igg <dig> with blood-borne antigens must occur before they bind to macrophage fcγriii. in contrast to the ige-mediated pathway, this pathway takes relatively longer to induce anaphylaxis, requires high concentrations of igg <dig> for elicitation, and involves platelet activating factors , rather than histamine, as the primary mediator in this type of anaphylactic shock  <cit> . in our study, the release of histamine within  <dig> min of i.p. challenge of balb/c mice strongly suggests that allergic and anaphylactic responses related to blg, ova or pna sensitization and challenge were ige mediated.

finally, the pca data in this study demonstrated that balb/c mice responded positively and developed blg-, ova- or pna-specific immunoglobulin ige. this positive pca response was exclusively due to the binding of antigen-specific iges with fcεris on mast cell rather than the binding of igg <dig> with fcγriii, since mice were sensitized with antigen specific anti-sera and challenged with the respective antigens and evans blue dye after  <dig> h of anti-sera sensitization; only ige is capable of remain bound to high affinity fcεri for this period of time  <cit> .

analysis of mln transcriptome profile of balb/c mice sensitized with blg, ova or pna revealed the differential expression of numerous genes that are associated with activation of the th <dig> response. this method of transcriptome profiling appeared to be very sensitive that identified differential expression of hundreds of genes in balb/c mice within  <dig> h of the second sensitization with the given food allergens. comparison of the differentially expressed genes in blg, ova and pna sensitized groups implicates that a common set of genes involved in the sensitization phase of the immune response to these three food allergens in balb/c mice. a total of  <dig> overlapping genes being differentially expressed in the same direction among the three food allergen sensitized groups. among these genes, the expression of timp <dig> was up-regulated, whereas the expression of stard <dig> and igj were down-regulated in all three antigen sensitized groups. the involvement of timp <dig> with the allergic response is very well documented; being an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, it plays a central role in degradation of extracellular matrix and remodeling of tissue during inflammatory process  <cit> , and appears to be involved in asthma  <cit> . induction of timp <dig> has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of other allergic conditions including atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> .

stard <dig> is known to be involved in the binding and directional transport of the cholesterol into the liver for the synthesis of bile acid  <cit> , and its expression is reported to be down-regulated in the presence of cholesterol  <cit> . it is not clear from available reports whether stard <dig> plays any direct role in the allergic response, however, the microarray and real-time rt-pcr data from all antigen sensitized groups in our study demonstrates its involvement in the sensitization of food allergens.

igj gene products are produced by antibody secreting plasma cells after antigen or cytokine stimulation. they are incorporated into pentameric igm and dimeric iga immunoglobulins and play a crucial role in the cellular and mucosal secretion of these molecules  <cit> . plager et al.  <cit>  reported that the expression of igj is down-regulated in patients with atopic dermatitis and this may be due to isotype switching of plasma cells from igm and iga production to igg <dig> and ige production. down-regulation of igj in both microarray and real-time rt-pcr experiments in our study among all antigen sensitized treatments indicates a possible induction of type i allergic reaction, and this was supported by the endpoints that we measured during the challenge phase.

several uniquely expressed genes were also activated in response to blg, ova or pna sensitization. for example, itgb <dig> was up-regulated by blg sensitization; this plasma membrane receptor is expressed on lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils, and may be involved in inducing allergic inflammatory response  <cit> . available reports also suggest that itgb <dig> may be involved in the airway smooth muscle responsiveness through the association with fibronectin and type i collagen during asthma or allergic inflammation  <cit> . the observed up-regulation of itgb <dig>  as indicated by both microarray analysis and real-time rt-pcr, is in agreement with these available reports, and demonstrates its possible role in food allergic process. in contrast, cd79a was down-regulated in blg sensitized group, and genes syt <dig> and pex <dig> were up- and down-regulated, respectively in ova sensitized group. it is not known whether the genes cd79a, syt <dig> and pex <dig> play any direct role in any allergic conditions. however, microarray analysis and real-time rt-pcr results from this study implicates their involvement in blg or ova sensitization.

gene ontology analysis was also used to reveal the biological roles and molecular functions of the differentially expressed genes that were commonly and uniquely expressed among the allergen sensitized mice. these enriched go data further validated the involvement of the differentially expressed genes in allergen sensitizations in balb/c mice. a total of  <dig> go biological processes were commonly enriched among all three antigen sensitized groups  and at least  <dig> of these processes were related to immune or hypersensitivity related processes . the most significant overlapping enriched go biological process was the response to stimulus ; this process was enriched with  <dig> genes from the ova and pna sensitized groups, and with  <dig> genes from blg sensitized group . within the response to stimulus biological process, was a subcategory biological process referred to as immune response . a total of  <dig> genes from blg,  <dig> genes from ova and  <dig> genes from pna sensitized groups enriched this biological process. in addition to the immune response biological process other biological processes that were subcategories within the response to stimulus biological process were enriched with genes from blg, ova and pna sensitized groups. these subcategories included the acute inflammatory response , humoral immune response , regulation of immunoglobulin mediated immune response  and regulation of b cell-mediated immunity . enrichment of these biological processes indicates that the genes differentially expressed in response to blg, ova or pna sensitization are involved in the process of immune regulation or hypersensitivity responses.

two common differentially expressed genes that were involved in the enrichment of several of these immune or hypersensitivity related biological processes were fcer1γ and c <dig> , whose expression was up-regulated in all of the allergen treated groups of balb/c mice. among other genes, immunoglobulin heavy chain complex , and signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , and immunoglobulin joining chain  also played important role in the enrichment of other immune or hypersensitivity related biological processes . the involvement of fcεr1γ, stat <dig> and c <dig> with the allergic responses are very well documented. fcεr1γ for example, is expressed on the surface of mast cell and cross-linking of these ige bound receptors leads to mast cell degranulation, cytokine production, prostaglandin synthesis, survival and passive systemic anaphylaxis  <cit> . it has also been reported that elevated level of transcription factor stat <dig> is associated with the induction of house dust mite-mediated allergic inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness in mice  <cit> . likewise, stat <dig> is required for the active production of il-21-mediated ige production by human b cells  <cit> . complement c <dig> plays a central role as a mediator of airway hyper-responsiveness and asthma, and induces the expression of the th <dig> phenotype  <cit> . anaphylatoxin c3a, an enzymatic derivative of c <dig> also acts as a chemotactic factor that triggers the release of histamines and cationic proteins from mast cells and eosinophils respectively  <cit> . c3a also plays a role in smooth muscle contraction that is mediated by leukotrienes, prostanoids, and platelet-activating factor released from mast cells and eosinophils  <cit> . other commonly enriched go biological processes include actin filament-based process  and muscle development process . enrichment of these two biological processes suggests possible involvement of some of the differentially expressed genes with smooth muscle contraction, bronchoconstriction and vasodilation that are the common phenomena associated with type i allergic responses or anaphylaxis. some of the differentially expressed genes enriched these processes include scinderin , supervillin  and villin  <dig> . scin is an actin-filament severing and capping protein activated by calcium is known to be differentially expressed in balb/c mice exposed to ova, and suggested to be a potential biomarker of asthma, a type i allergy  <cit> . similarly, vil <dig> is another actin-binding protein that is known for ige-binding and ige-cross-reactivity with other plant proteins of the same family  <cit> . therefore, differential expression of these genes and enrichment of these go biological processes illustrate the possible involvement of these genes in food allergic sensitizations.

go analysis further revealed the molecular functions of some of the differentially expressed genes . one significant overlapping enriched go molecular function was the calcium ion binding . enrichment of this molecular function is well correlated with other enriched biological processes and emphasized its involvement in the food allergy response. a recent report suggests that the binding of the antigens with the receptors on the t, b or mast cells induces a series of biochemical reactions leading to a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration that leads to other downstream reactions in the process of allergic response  <cit> . another report also suggests that antigen-induced fcεri-mediated cell migration/chemotaxis is dependent on cytosolic free calcium concentration  <cit> . therefore, the enrichment of these go biological processes and molecular functions support the involvement of these differentially expressed genes in the food allergic responses during early sensitization phase. thus, these gene expression data enabled us to monitor the allergenicity of some of the common food allergens and proved to be sensitive enough to identify the allergic/immune responses within  <dig> h of the sensitizations in the used animal model.

the experimental mice used in this study were systemically exposed to the food antigens by i.p. injection without any adjuvants, and they responded positively to all of the antigens, as indicated by the increased ear swelling response, elevated serum igg <dig>  ige, plasma histamine and a positive pca test. oral sensitization was specifically avoided in this study because there is a potential risk of developing oral tolerance when antigens are administered via this route  <cit> . in order to avoid the development of oral tolerance, adjuvants, such as cholera toxin is being used during oral sensitization processes. however, immune/allergic response developed such a way does not mimic the actual immune/allergic response in humans and this may lead to misinterpretation of the data due to hyperstimulation of the immune system  <cit> . in our study, we sensitized the balb/c mice via the i.p. route with only two consecutive injections of allergens on day  <dig> and  <dig> without any adjuvants. use of this route for sensitization not only allowed us to avoid the use of any kind of adjuvants but also allowed us to observe the true effects of the allergens used without having any unwanted external stimulations or influences. thus, the gene expression data presented here in our study corresponds only to the effects of the food allergens used for sensitizations that may mimic the actual allergic responses in humans. in this study, the pca data indicated that one mouse in blg and another mouse in the ova treated group did not appear to be sensitized. although they were a different group of animals than those used for the gene expression study, there is the possibility that non-responders may contribute to the variation in gene expression during the sensitization phase.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, microarray data from this study implicate the involvement of many previously known genes as well as numerous novel genes in the pathogenesis of food allergy. this method of gene expression analysis proved to be a sensitive method in identifying the allergenicity of known food proteins. results from this study will help to better understand the molecular mechanism involved in the sensitization to food allergens and may help in developing new drug target for the therapy of food allergy in future. the results presented here in this study are only the first step and further studies are needed to establish this method for using as a screening tool to assess the allergenicity of other food proteins. with further studies in future, the genes differentially expressed here in this study may establish a pool of biomarker genes that can be used to determine the potential allergenicity of other food proteins of novel origin. future studies may want to consider characterizing the effects of time and dose-response relationships among these allergens and their influence on gene expression, and investigate if this model is effective for identifying allergens with low potency. further studies are also needed to observe the effects of a non-allergenic protein on the gene expression profiling of this animal model.
