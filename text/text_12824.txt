BACKGROUND
the correct establishment and propagation of epigenetic states are essential for normal development, and disruption of these processes leads to disease. genomic imprinting is a striking example of the effect of epigenetics on gene regulation. in genomic imprinting, a mark, the imprint, is imposed on the two parental genomes during gametogenesis. in the zygote, the imprint is maintained through each mitotic division and results in the parental alleles of a gene, or entire homologous chromosomes, adopting different epigenetic states. as a result of these different epigenetic states, one parental allele can be silenced while the allele from the other parent, although identical in dna sequence, is active.

the ccctc-binding factor, ctcf, is a key player in maintaining epigenetically distinct chromatin domains. ctcf is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger-containing dna-binding protein that can function both directly in gene regulation as a transcription factor and also indirectly by mediating long-range chromatin interactions. in this latter role, ctcf acts as a chromatin insulator by isolating enhancer and promoter regulatory units and as a barrier to the spread of heterochromatin  <cit> . ctcf binds at multiple sites throughout the genome  <cit> , indicating a widespread role in generating chromatin domains. epigenetic isolation is necessary for correct maintenance of genomic imprints as imprinted domains are often interspersed among nonimprinted domains  <cit> , necessitating their isolation from flanking regulatory regions. additionally, the two homologous alleles must be isolated as differential gene expression patterns, chromatin conformations, and replication timing have all been associated with imprinted alleles  <cit> .

ctcf binding has been reported at multiple mammalian imprinted domains  <cit> , illustrating the importance of insulator function in maintaining parent-specific expression. the role of ctcf in imprinting has been best characterized for the mammalian igf2/h <dig> genes, in which only the maternal h <dig> allele and paternal igf <dig> alleles are expressed  <cit> . on the maternal chromosome, ctcf binds to a differentially methylated domain  located between the igf <dig> and h <dig> genes, preventing interaction of downstream enhancer sequences with the promoter of igf <dig>  effectively silencing the gene. methylation of the paternal dmd effectively blocks ctcf binding, allowing activation of igf <dig> expression while also initiating the silencing of the h <dig> gene. binding of ctcf is necessary to maintain the epigenetic state of the imprinted alleles. consequently, if the ctcf binding site in the igf2/h <dig> dmd is mutated, the monoallelic expression arising from the imprint is lost  <cit> . an additional facet of ctcf binding appears to be the facilitation of higher-order chromatin structures through dna looping, a property which fortifies the silencing of igf <dig> and the activation of h <dig> on the maternal chromosome  <cit> . the details of ctcf binding and its consequences are less well studied at other imprinted loci; however, its insulator function and role in establishing higher-order chromatin function appear to be shared features of other mammalian imprinted loci which bind ctcf  <cit> . the kvdmr <dig> imprinted domain, which contains two ctcf binding sites, regulates the tissue-specific expression of the gene cdkn1c. it has been suggested that the tissue-specific imprinting of cdkn1c is due to tissue-specific binding of ctcf to the kvdmr <dig> imprint domain  <cit> . the imprinted domain wsb1/nf <dig> also requires ctcf-mediated interchromosomal association with the igf2/h <dig> imprinted domain for proper parent-specific expression  <cit> .

although ctcf appears to be the major insulator protein in vertebrates, the more compact drosophila genome uses a variety of insulator proteins, among which is the drosophila ctcf homolog dctcf  <cit> . the insulator activity of dctcf has been well characterized in the bithorax complex, where it demarcates the chromatin domains that define separate regulatory regions  <cit> , and, as in mammals, dctcf is widely used as an insulator throughout the drosophila genome and also acts directly as a transcription factor  <cit> . though the role of ctcf in the formation of distinct chromatin domains is conserved from drosophila to mammals, the roles of ctcf in epigenetic processes such as genomic imprinting have been assumed to differ  <cit> . to assess the effect of dctcf on drosophila imprinting, we used a well-characterized imprinting assay system, the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome, in which a readily visible eye color gene, garnet , is juxtaposed to an imprint control region and so becomes a marker for imprinting  <cit> . regulation of the dplj <dig> imprint previously has been shown to share properties of mammalian imprinting, including transcriptional silencing of gene clusters and differential chromatin states between homologues  <cit> . here we present the first demonstration that dctcf has a role in the regulation of genomic imprinting in drosophila. as is the case in mammalian imprinting, dctcf in drosophila is involved in the regulation of the maternal imprint by maintaining parent-specific expression from the maternally inherited x chromosome.

RESULTS
characterization of ctcf alleles
the ctcfey <dig> allele  was produced by insertion of the p{epgy2} element into the + <dig> position relative to the transcription start site of the dctcf gene by the berkeley drosophila genome project  gene disruption project  <cit> . homozygous ctcfey <dig> adults appear healthy and are reasonably fertile. ctcf <dig>  created by a partial deletion of the p{epgy2} element, is homozygous lethal. ctcf <dig> lacks the entire 5' end of the p{epgy2} element but retains  <dig> bp of the 3' end. flanking dctcf sequences and the quemao  gene remain intact in ctcf <dig>  the reduced severity of ctcfey <dig>  with an intact p{epgy2} element, suggests that a promoter in the 5' end of p{epgy2} may partially rescue dctcf expression. to test this idea, we measured the dctcf transcript levels by quantitative real-time pcr  of third instar larvae. expression in homozygous ctcfey <dig> larvae is 20% ± 4% of that in wild-type  controls. this is consistent with previous studies showing that ctcfey <dig> homozygotes produce ~50% of wild-type dctcf protein levels  <cit> . homozygous ctcf <dig> larvae cannot be recovered in sufficient numbers for qrt-pcr, but heterozygous ctcf30/+ larvae display  <dig> ± 9% of wild-type transcript levels, consistent with a severe reduction in expression by this mutation. taken together, the phenotypic and expression analysis of dctcf alleles indicates that both ctcfey <dig> and ctcf <dig> alleles have reduced dctcf expression and that the 5' end of p{epgy2} may drive sufficient expression to allow recovery of ctcfey <dig> adults.

drosophila ctcf maintains the maternal imprint of the garnet gene on the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome
to test the effect of the dctcf alleles on drosophila imprinting, we used the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome. maternal inheritance of the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosomes lj9mat) generate full expression of the marker gene garnet, whereas paternal inheritance lj9pat) generates variegated garnet expression . the variegated garnet gene phenotype arising from paternal transmission is mitotically stable and so results in distinct clonal regions exhibiting garnet expression in an eye devoid of garnet expression. expression of garnet affects both red  and brown  eye pigments, which makes this mini-x chromosome an easily assayed system in which to assess the effect of dctcf alleles on imprinting in drosophila.

transmission of the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome through the female results in y1zag53d/dplj9; +/+ mini-x chromosome-bearing male progeny with essentially wild-type expression of the garnet imprint marker gene. eyes are phenotypically wild type, with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % wild-type red pigment levels and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % wild-type brown pigment levels . to determine the effects of dctcf on the maternal maintenance of imprinted garnet expression, the ctcfx alleles  were crossed to females with the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome: y1zag53d/y; ctcfx/tm <dig>  sb ser males x x^x/dplj <dig> females. this cross-generated progeny with a mutant dctcf allele and a maternally imprinted mini-x chromosome lj9mat; ctcfx/+), which were compared with progeny similarly carrying a maternally imprinted chromosome, but wild type for dctcf.

for each dctcf allele tested, the mutant allele substantially reduced expression of the maternally transmitted imprint marker gene . progeny with a maternally inherited mini-x chromosome lj9mat) with ctcfey <dig> reduced pigment levels to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  for red and brown pigments, respectively. dplj9mat progeny coupled with ctcf <dig> resulted in an even greater reduction of pigment levels:  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  for red and brown pigments, respectively. no variegated garnet expression was observed in flies with dplj9mat and wild type for dctcf . however, when dplj9mat was inherited along with mutant dctcf alleles, variegated garnet expression was observed . these results demonstrate that the maintenance of the maternal imprint is highly sensitive to dctcf dosage.

this cross also produced sibling progeny that have a maternally inherited dplj9mat, but with the balancer chromosome, and so wild type for dctcf lj9mat; tm <dig>  sb ser /+). these internal control flies are genotypically identical to the external controls but have the male parent mutant for ctcfx and so would allow detection of any paternal effect. none was detected .

drosophila ctcf does not regulate the paternal imprint of the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome
variegated silencing of garnet from the paternally inherited dplj9pat is a consequence of the spreading of heterochromatin from the imprinted region  <cit> . in contrast to the effects observed when the dplj <dig> is maternally imprinted, dctcf mutants had no effect on the paternal expression of the garnet imprint marker gene. paternal inheritance of the mini-x chromosome lj <dig> males crossed to y1zag53d/y1zag53d; tm <dig>  sb ser/+ females) results in y1zag53d/dplj9pat; +/+ progeny with variegated garnet expression and a marked reduction in eye pigment levels . the introduction of dctcf mutant alleles lj <dig> males) to generate progeny with either mutant ctcfey <dig> or ctcf <dig> alleles and a paternally imprinted dplj9pat mini-x chromosome lj9; ctcfx/+), yielded no significant change in either red or brown eye pigment levels or phenotype .

sibling progeny with a paternally inherited dplj9pat along with the balancer chromosome are wild type for dctcf lj9; tm <dig>  sb ser/+) and can be used to determine whether there is a maternal effect from mothers mutant for ctcfx. no maternal effect was detected; progeny wild type for dctcf from mothers with either ctcfey <dig> or ctcf <dig> showed no significant change in garnet expression levels .

drosophila ctcf does not regulate the establishment of the maternal or paternal imprint of the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome
to determine whether the effect of dctcf was on the somatic maintenance of the imprint or its establishment in the germline of the parents, we examined the phenotype of progeny from male or female parents with both the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome and a mutant ctcf <dig> allele. if dctcf affects the establishment of the imprint, the imprint should be disrupted in the progeny of mutant ctcf <dig> parents, but not wild-type  parents. when we compared the phenotype of progeny wild type for dctcf but differing in their parental genotype, no significant alternation in garnet expression levels resulted between dplj9mat progeny from mothers carrying ctcf <dig>  and either of the external or internal controls wild type for dctcf . this was reflected in the unchanged phenotype of progeny from mothers mutant or wild type for dctcf . likewise, mutant dctcf did not effect the establishment of the paternal imprint. dplj9pat progeny from fathers carrying dplj <dig> and ctcf <dig>  had no significant change in garnet expression compared with either the external or internal controls . again, these dplj9pat progeny also had no observable change in phenotype between fathers mutant or wild type for dctcf . these findings distinguish the function of dctcf in the maintenance versus the establishment of the imprint on the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome; dctcf is involved in the maintenance of the imprint in the soma of progeny as its reduction disrupts the maternal imprint. however, dctcf is not involved in the establishment of the imprint as the presence of mutant ctcf <dig> in either the maternal or paternal germline during establishment of the imprint does not affect regulation of the imprint.

drosophila ctcf is not a general modifier of position-effect variegation
to determine the effect of dctcf mutant alleles on the dplj9mat imprint, we tested the effect of ctcf <dig> on inwm <dig>  a classical variegating rearrangement  <cit> , and two fourth chromosome transgenic constructs  <cit>  in which the white  gene is variegated. like the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome, the variegated silencing in inwm <dig> is induced by the centric heterochromatin of the x chromosome  <cit>  and the fourth chromosome has been proposed to be evolutionarily related to the x chromosome  <cit> . we found that the ctcf <dig> allele decreased silencing of white in inwm4;ctcf30/+ females while having no significant effect on white expression levels in inwm4;ctcf30/+ males compared with sibling inwm4;tb/+ controls . similarly, the 6-m <dig> strain responded to ctcf <dig> with a modest decrease in white reporter silencing in females only , whereas the 39c- <dig> strain showed no significant change in white reporter silencing from ctcf <dig> . these results demonstrate that ctcf <dig> is not a ubiquitous modifier of variegated heterochromatic silencing in drosophila, consistent with the absence of an effect on silencing of the paternally inherited dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome. furthermore, the decreased silencing of the nonimprinted variegators is opposite to the effect of ctcf <dig> on dplj9mat silencing. thus, the role of dctcf in the maintenance of the maternal dplj <dig> imprint represents a distinct parent-specific function for dctcf on the imprinted dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome.

discussion
ctcf is essential for insulator function in vertebrates, where it plays an active role in regulating imprinted gene expression. in drosophila, dctcf has likewise been shown to be involved in the insulator function of boundary elements  <cit> . our results show that parent-specific expression from an imprinted domain in drosophila is dependent on dctcf function. maintenance of expression from maternally inherited dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome is highly sensitive to dctcf; even a modest decrease in dctcf mrna alters the maternal imprint so that it resembles the paternal imprint.

the effect of dctcf on maternal-specific expression is limited to the maintenance of imprint. the presence of mutant dctcf in either the maternal or paternal parents, when the imprint is being established, does not affect the imprint in the progeny. these results are strikingly similar to the role of ctcf in mammalian imprinting, where ctcf assists in the postfertilization formation of an imprinted region, but is dispensable for the establishment of an imprint  <cit> .

furthermore, the requirement for dctcf for maintenance of the maternal dplj <dig> imprint is specific and does not represent a ubiquitous role for dctcf in regulating heterochromatic silencing. not only is the paternal dplj <dig> imprint unaffected by mutant dctcf, but other variegating drosophila reporter genes respond differently to mutant dctcf. thus, the association of dctcf expression with the maintenance of the maternal dplj <dig> imprint boundary demonstrates a distinct function for dctcf in imprinted gene expression.

in mammals, maternally imprinted regions that bind ctcf rely critically on this binding to insulate the imprinted loci and establish distinct chromatin domains. our results show that a reduction in dctcf levels disrupts the maternal imprint boundary on the drosophila dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome, and consequently the marker gene, garnet, is silenced. variegated silencing of garnet from dplj9pat inheritance is a consequence of heterochromatin formation, nucleated from the paternal imprint control region, spreading in cis  <cit> . the absence of an effect upon the introduction of dctcf mutant alleles to dplj9pat suggests that dctcf binding and boundary function occurs only on the maternal chromosome. thus, it is conceivable that a reduction in dctcf levels enables the spreading of heterochromatin on the maternal dplj9mat in a manner similar to that of the paternal dplj9pat. this would suggest that dctcf defines the boundary of a distinct maternal-specific imprinted chromatin domain required to maintain maternal-specific gene expression on the x chromosome.

the model organism encyclopedia of dna elements  project provides detailed mapping of regulatory elements throughout the drosophila genome  <cit> . large-scale profiling of dctcf insulator sites from early embryo modencode data reveals several candidate dctcf insulator sites present proximal to the predicted heterochromatic breakpoint of the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome. these dctcf insulator sites, located between the centric heterochromatic imprinting center and the imprint marker gene garnet, could account for the sensitivity of the maternal imprint to dctcf expression. if dctcf were bound only when the x chromosome was transmitted maternally, mutations to dctcf would disrupt insulator function and lead to maternal silencing of the imprint marker gene. although such binding remains to be tested, it is similar to the function of ctcf at mammalian imprinted regions.

that the structure of ctcf and its role as an insulator, barrier, and transcriptional regulator is conserved between mammals and insects have been well established  <cit> . however, the finding that ctcf maintains its function in regulating the imprinting of diverse genes in such phylogenetically distinct organisms is remarkable. ctcf is a versatile dna binding factor; subsets of its zinc fingers are adept at binding diverse dna sequences, and the rest of the protein is able to maintain common regulator interactions and insulator function  <cit> . this feature may explain how ctcf can regulate imprinting in organisms as diverse as insects and mammals, in which the imprinted target sequences are different.

previously, the evolutionary origin of imprinting has been extrapolated from the conservation of imprinting among specific genes. such studies have led to the proposal that mammalian imprinting is of relatively recent origin and restricted to eutherian mammals  <cit> . however, studies showing that the molecular mechanism of imprinting is highly conserved have suggested a much more ancient origin  <cit> . mammalian imprint control elements inserted into transgenic drosophila act as discrete silencing elements  <cit>  and can retain posttranscriptional silencing mechanisms involving noncoding rna  <cit> . whereas these transgenic imprinting elements lose their parent-specific functions, the retention of epigenetic silencing mechanisms suggests an ancient and conserved origin of imprinting mechanisms. our finding that ctcf has a role in the maintenance of maternal imprints in insects, as it does in mammals, supports the possibility of evolutionary conservation for both ctcf function and the mechanisms of genomic imprinting.

CONCLUSIONS
ctcf is a multifunctional protein with a conserved role as a chromosomal insulator in both mammals and drosophila. to determine whether dctcf is involved in imprinted regulation in drosophila as it is in mammals, we generated a dctcf mutant allele with severe reduction in dctcf expression and tested its effects on the expression of the imprint marker gene, garnet, on the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome. full garnet gene expression, which occurs when the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome is maternally inherited, was disrupted when dctcf expression levels were reduced. no effect of reduced dctcf expression was observed on the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome when it was inherited paternally. the effect of dctcf mutations is on the maintenance rather than on the establishment of the imprint, and is specific to the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome. these results demonstrate that dctcf is involved in maintaining parent-specific expression from the maternally inherited x chromosome in drosophila, a role paralleling its involvement in mammalian imprinting.
