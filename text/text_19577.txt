BACKGROUND
multiple sclerosis  is an autoimmune disorder marked by the infiltration of pathogenic t cells into the central nervous system  that cause inflammation and oligodendrocyte cell death. in an animal model of ms, called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , vaccination with cns-myelin-derived peptides triggers the expansion of oligodendrocyte-specific t cells and a pathological profile that includes cns inflammation, demyelination, and paralysis. transmigration of pathogenic t cells across the blood-brain barrier  is facilitated by the expression of cell adhesion molecules and proteinases that degrade the ecm  <cit> . the discovery that eae can be prevented by broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors implicated this large family of enzymes in disease progression  <cit>  and has led to recent clinical trials  <cit> . matrix metalloproteinases  are extracellular enzymes that can cleave ecm and non-matrix proteins, including laminin, collagen, cytokines, other proteinases, and the ectodomains of several membrane proteins. mmps are usually secreted as pro-enzymes that can be cleavage-activated by plasminogen activators, trypsin, other mmps, and oxidation. elevated levels of mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> have been reported in human ms patients, and in brain and spinal cord extracts from eae-induced rodents  <cit> . in a delayed-type hypersensitivity model for ms, mmp- <dig> was found to be the most up-regulated mmp, compared with mmp- <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> .

within tissues, mmps usually reside in extracellular spaces as inactive proforms, and factors that activate even a small proportion of those mmps have significant biological effects. therefore, determining which factors contribute to mmp activity in ms will be critical to understanding the role these enzymes play in this disorder. cerebrospinal fluid levels of mmp- <dig> activity are elevated in ms patients and in rodent models of eae  <cit> , and young mmp- <dig> knockout mice  are resistant to eae  <cit> . mmp- <dig> plays a critical role in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling  <cit> . although mmp- <dig> expression does not increase in ms or eae, mmp- <dig> activation may contribute to localized permeabilization of the cerebrovasculature. mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are structurally similar gelatinases that can each be activated by mmp- <dig>  <cit> . mmp- <dig> can also cleave many eae-relevant substrates, including laminin, type iv collagen  <cit> , β4-integrin  <cit> , ve-cadherin  <cit> , e-cadherin  <cit>  and the immune suppressor fas ligand   <cit> . further, mmp- <dig> has been reported as necessary for the trans-epithelial efflux of immune cells in bleomycin-treated lungs  <cit> , which is similar to the extravasation that immune cells must make in eae and ms.

myelin-specific t cells can be detected in the blood of ms patients and eae-induced mice even during periods of remission, when they no longer persist in the cns. tight junctions between microvascular endothelial cells within the brain prevent the direct entry of macromolecules and blood-borne cells, forming the bbb. compromise of bbb integrity facilitates immune cell access to the cns and is essential for ms and eae. for example, mri detection of gadolinium accumulation in the brain lesions of ms patients is an indicator of compromised bbb integrity and a reliable predictor of pending disease activity. factors that affect the cell-to-cell contacts of cerebrovascular endothelial cells, or their viability, can reduce bbb integrity and increase immune cell access to the cns. ve-cadherin is an important component of tight junctions between endothelial cells and is also a substrate for cleavage by both mmp- <dig>  <cit>  and mmp- <dig>  <cit> . the two layers or ecm that surround the cerebrovasculature contain laminin and type iv collagen, which are cleaved by mmp- <dig>  <cit> , as well as collagens and elastins are cleaved by mmp- <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to the bbb, immune cells actions are restricted within the cns action by the expression of cell death ligands cd95l/fas ligand/fasl and trail that can trigger apoptosis in activated t cells and myeloid cells. fasl is a potent inducer of apoptosis in activated t cells  <cit>  and its expression is elevated in response to injuries that compromise bbb integrity  <cit> . facial nerve damage locally increases fasl expression and t cell apoptosis around the facial nucleus in eae-induced mice  <cit> . the availability of fasl is closely regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels, which includes proteolytic cleavage of its receptor binding region by mmp- <dig>  <cit>  and mmp- <dig>  <cit> . while membrane-bound fasl has potent pro-apoptotic activity for activated t cells, cleaved or soluble fasl  shows differential effects, depending on the disease model and specific cell types  <cit> . moreover, sfasl has a chemotaxic effect on mononuclear cells, which can be blocked by anti-fasl antibodies  <cit> .

here, we used mmp-7-deficient  mice to investigate the role of this proteinase in eae. wild-type  and mmp7-/- mice were compared for clinical and immunological responses to an encephalitogenic fragment of myelin oligodendrocyte protein peptide . localization of mmp- <dig> expression in the cns was examined during eae in mog-primed mice at the peak of eae. mog-specific proliferation of splenocytes, lymphocytes, cd4+, and cd8+ t cells were compared in both strains of mice. we also used adoptive transfer to assess the encephalitogenic potential of t cells from wt and mmp7-/- mice to induce eae in recipients of both strains. finally, we tested the effects of active mmp- <dig> on endothelial cell connectivity using an established in vitro model of the bbb.

RESULTS
mmp7-/- mice are resistant to eae
to determine if mmp- <dig> plays a critical role in eae we compared the responses of wt and mmp7-/- mice, congenic with the c57bl/ <dig> background, to mog35– <dig>  clinical evidence of eae was observed in 9/ <dig> wt mice , with scores up to  <dig>  and an average peak near  <dig>  . clinical scores showed paralysis beginning 12– <dig> days after mog injection, which was consistent with previous reports of mice with this genetic background  <cit> . none of the mmp7-/- mice showed any paralysis . age-matched wt and mmp7-/-mice were injected simultaneously in  <dig> separate experiments, with similar results.

haematoxylin and eosin staining of brain sections from wt mice isolated  <dig> days after mog injection, near the peak of eae, showed extensive mononuclear cell infiltration . perivascular cuffing, a classic feature of encephalitis, was not seen in the brains of mog-primed mmp7-/- mice . wt mice also showed patches of demyelination adjacent to perivascular cuffs that were infiltrated by mononuclear cells and contained pycnotic nuclei , all of which were absent in mmp7-/- mice . these findings indicate that mmp7-/- mice are resistant to a stimulus that induces eae in wt mice.

myeloid cells are the primary expressers of mmp- <dig> during eae
mmp- <dig> expression in wt mice was localized by immunostaining sections from brains that were isolated during eae,  <dig> days after vaccination. previous reports have described elevated mmp- <dig> levels in brain and spinal cord during delayed type hypersensitivity and eae, up to 500-fold over controls  <cit> . we observed strong mmp- <dig> immunostaining in perivascular cuffs , in cells that co-stained for the monocyte marker iba- <dig> . most mmp-7/iba- <dig> immunopositive cells were in close proximity to vascular structures, but several cells were within the parenchyma and notably enlarged, possibly due to active phagocytosis. further immunostaining revealed that mmp- <dig> also co-localized with tomato lectin and gr- <dig> , common though less specific markers for myeloid cells. although mmp- <dig> is an extracellular proteinase, it binds strongly to heparan sulphate on the surface of mmp-7-producing cells  <cit> . interestingly, heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been reported to mediate monocyte migration across the bbb  <cit> .

endothelial cells in the cerebrovasculature are surrounded by astrocyte end-feet processes, which regulate bbb integrity. reactive astrocytes produce a variety of factors in response to injury and infection, so we examined whether astrocytes expressed mmp- <dig> during eae by co-immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein . mice with high eae clinical scores showed robust mmp- <dig> immunoreactivity around inflamed vascular structures, but within the parenchyma mmp- <dig> immunoreactivity did not co-localize with gfap-positive cells . although astrocyte end-feet were adjacent to cells with strong mmp- <dig> staining, gfap-positive cells did not appear to express the enzyme. these findings indicate that macrophages and not astrocytes are the primary producers of mmp- <dig> during eae, which is consistent with other reports  <cit> .

the choroid plexus consists of highly vascularized structures that produce cerebrospinal fluid  within brain ventricles. although choroid plexus has highly fenestrated capillaries, blood components are kept separate from cerebrospinal fluid by tight junctions between specialized ependymal cells in the outer layer, constituting the blood-csf barrier . between fenestrated capillaries and ependymal cell layers is a basal lamina composed largely of collagen in which we observed strong immunoreactivity for mmp- <dig>  notably, cd4+ t cells were observed between these layers but did not show mmp- <dig> immunoreactivity . accumulation of mmp- <dig> within the choroid plexus may degrade components of the basal lamina and connective tissue, or disrupt cadherin-mediated contacts. indeed, confocal microscopy revealed patches of mmp- <dig> that appeared to breach the ependymal layer of the choroid plexus and become continuous with the csf-containing lateral ventricle . significantly, such breaches in the bcb would permit the passage of immunoglobulins and serum proteins into the csf, an important diagnostic indicator of ms.

mmp-7-deficiency diminishes mog-specific t cell responses
to determine whether a lack of mmp- <dig> prevents mog-specific immune responses, we assayed representative cell populations from wt and mmp7-/- mice, in vitro. splenocytes and lymphocytes were isolated from mice  <dig> days after mog-injection and then cultured with mog and 3h-thymidine. after  <dig> days, splenocytes from both wt and mmp7-/- mice showed higher 3h-thymidine incorporation in response to mog  when compared with controls . however, mog-induced proliferation of mmp7-/- splenocytes was less than wt cells. primary lymphocytes from mog-primed mmp7-/- mice also showed less proliferation in response to mog in vitro, compared with wt. higher density lymphocyte cultures showed similar results . these findings demonstrated that splenocytes and lymphocytes from mmp7-/- mice have lower antigen-specific proliferation in response to mog, in vitro.

the proliferation of t cells can only be inferred from 3h-thymidine incorporation studies, so we investigated mog-specific responses of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells using cfse pre-labelling and facs analysis. after  <dig> days in vitro, control cd4+ t cells from wt mice proliferated up to  <dig> generations, with further divisions making a negligible component . further proliferation was induced by il- <dig> with a small, but measurable proportion of cells dividing up to  <dig> generations . mog induced a higher proportion of cells beyond  <dig> generations than did il- <dig>  constituting nearly  <dig> % of the original cells that became cd4+ . cd4+ t cells isolated from mog-primed mmp7-/- mice showed similar responses to il- <dig>  but less proliferation in response to mog . although mog-specific proliferation of cd4+ t cells from mog-primed mmp7-/- mice was less with mog-primed wt, mog-specific proliferation was present.

in addition to cd4+ t cells, the transfer of myelin-specific cd8+ t cells can also cause severe eae  <cit> . cfse analysis showed that cd8-expressing t cells did not proliferate past  <dig> generations in control cultures . however, significant proliferation of up to the 10th generation was observed in response to il- <dig>  and mog . cd8+ t cells isolated from mmp7-/- mice also showed minimal proliferation in control media  and substantial proliferation in response to il- <dig> , but again mog-induced proliferation was reduced compared with wt .

transfer of t cells from mog-primed mice induced eae in wt but not mmp7-/- recipients
we found that mog-specific cd4+ and cd8+ t cell proliferation was reduced in mmp7-/- mice, but still present, so we tested if mog-specific t cells from mmp7-/- mice were encephalitogenic using adoptive transfer. to examine this possibility we isolated splenocytes and lymphocytes from mog-primed mmp7-/- donors, re-stimulated with mog in vitro, and then adoptively transferred those cells into naïve mmp7-/- and wt recipients. within  <dig> days all wt recipients  showed signs of paralysis that persisted for the entire  <dig> day post-injection period . although eae scores were low, difficulties with balance and gripping a tilted cage top were apparent in all wt recipients. in contrast, none of the mmp7-/- recipients  showed any signs of eae during the  <dig> day post-transfer period. these findings indicate that mmp7-/- mice produce encephalitogenic t cells that can cause disease in wt mice, even though they have reduced t cell responses to mog. in a reciprocal study, we found that splenocytes/lymphocytes from mog-primed wt mice could also cause disease in wt mice , with clinical scores of 1– <dig>  but mmp7-/- recipients were resistant to the encephalitogenic effects of those cells . therefore, mmp7-/- mice are resistant to encephalitogenic t cells from mmp7-/- or wt mice.

mmp- <dig> affects the permeability of brain endothelial cell barriers
to test whether mmp- <dig> affects tight junctions between cerebrovascular endothelial cells of the bbb, we used an established in vitro model consisting of porous hollow fibres and perfusion to replicate the pressure dynamics of brain capillaries  <cit> . primary rat brain micro-vascular endothelial cells were grown inside the tubes and primary rat-brain astrocytes outside. constant media flow through the lumen replicates the shear dynamics for vascular endothelial cells that line the tubes. after several days tight junctions connect endothelial cells lining the lumen to the extent that a trans-endothelial electrical resistance  can be measured. these junctions between endothelial cells depend on ve-cadherin, a substrate for mmp- <dig>  <cit> . we tested whether recombinant mmp- <dig> could alter permeability across these layers of brain endothelial cells by measuring the teer. mmp- <dig> added to the brain-side  compartment did not decrease teer and even slightly increased teer by an as yet undetermined mechanism that may work through astroglia . however, mmp- <dig> affected the vascular endothelial cells when placed on lumenal side  and caused a near-term 15–20% drop in teer, with a subsequent drop of 40–45% after  <dig> days . this loss of electrical resistance is consistent with increased permeability of the endothelial cell layer lining the lumen of the micro-capillaries. therefore, high local concentrations of mmp- <dig>  as found on the surface of macrophages, can reduce the integrity of endothelial cell-to-cell contacts and may facilitate the transmigration of immune cells across the bbb.

discussion
high mmp- <dig> activity has been reported in demyelinating ms lesions and in the cerebrospinal fluid of ms patients  <cit> , yet the role of this extracellular proteinase in ms is still unclear. here, we have shown that mmp7-/- mice are resistant to mog-induced eae. diminished t cell responses to mog make it less likely that eae will develop, but mmp7-/- mice still produce encephalitogenic t cells that can cause disease in wt mice. immuno-localization of mmp- <dig> in areas adjacent to vascular structures suggests that it may facilitate immune access at the bbb. a common diagnostic feature of ms is mri-detectable breaches of the bbb and spokes of demyelination that project outwardly from a cerebrovascular core . localization of mmp- <dig> to breaches of the bbb suggests that it may act directly on bbb integrity. we tested this possibility using an in vitro bbb model and found that the direct exposure of brain endothelial cells to recombinant mmp- <dig> increased the permeability between those cells. in contrast, mmp- <dig> did not increase permeability on the brain side of the bbb, but it may have other effects.

inside the bbb, mmp- <dig> may contribute to eae by activating mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> , or by reducing immune privilege by cleaving fasl  <cit> . as a potent inducer of apoptosis in activated t cells, fasl is crucial to the recovery phase of eae. mice with defective fasl undergo more severe and prolonged eae, compared with wt mice  <cit> . indeed, cns injury models have shown that a localized increase of fasl expression within the cns is a consistent response to breaches of the bbb  <cit> . the potent activity of fasl can be attenuated by shedding the fas-binding domain by mmp- <dig>  <cit> . macrophages that infiltrate the cns and produce high local concentrations of mmp- <dig> may cause localized shedding of fasl and create discrete pockets of lowered immune privilege within the cns. this process could prolong the survival of activated t cells that would otherwise die by activation induced cell death or fasl-induced apoptosis. interestingly, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor  knockout mice are also resistant to mog-induced eae  <cit> ; however, their resistance is attributed to attenuated mog-specific t cell responses, perhaps due to fewer antigen-presenting cells. variables that affect macrophage availability might be expected to have a direct impact on mmp- <dig> production near cerebrovascular structures and also affect eae susceptibility.

within the brain mmp- <dig> may also contribute to memory, motor and cognitive problems that often accompany ms episodes. recent studies have shown that mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> can disrupt mature dendritic spines, causing them to assume immature morphologies, which greatly reduces the synaptic strength of excitatory synapses and can impact memory and behaviour  <cit> . furthermore, ephb receptors are critically important for the formation and maintenance of mature dendritic spines, and mmp- <dig> has recently been shown to cleave ephb  <cit> . infiltrating macrophages in perivascular cuffs or near demyelinating lesions might produce enough mmp- <dig> to activate extracellular pools of mmp- <dig>  and disrupt synapse stability in nearby areas – even without demyelination or overt pathology  <cit> .

several cytokines, including tnf-α, have been shown to increase mmp- <dig> expression and have been repeatedly linked with eae and ms inflammation  <cit> . ifn-β is a promising treatment for ms and has been shown to repress mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> expression for patients with relapsing-remitting ms  <cit> . our findings suggest that mmp- <dig> plays a role in the extravasation of immune cells during eae. mmp- <dig> expression adjacent to the cerebrovasculature and ependymal cells of the choroid plexus suggests that metalloproteinase inhibitors could prevent eae by blocking mmp- <dig> activity at these sites. interestingly, hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitors can prevent eae, but may not be able to cross an intact bbb, so their ability to prevent eae would depend on actions after the bbb has been compromised unless they work by inhibiting mmps outside of the bbb, such as mmp- <dig> on circulating monocytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that mmp- <dig> plays a critical role in mog-induced eae in c57bl/ <dig> mice, although it is possible that stronger encephalitogenic stimuli  in other mouse strains may respond differently to mmp- <dig> deficiency. the reduced response of cd4+ or cd8+ t cells to eae, did not preclude the production of encephalitogenic t cells, and may reflect an important role for mmp- <dig> in the antigen-presentation or the specialized microenvironment of lymphoid organs. immuno-localization of mmp- <dig> to myeloid cells and cerebrovascular structures, along with its ability to increase the permeability between endothelial cells, implicates this enzyme in compromising bbb and/or bcb integrity, and suggests that mmp- <dig> may have additional effects in the brain parenchyma that extend beyond lymphocyte infiltration.
