BACKGROUND
cancer can arise in many ways, one of the most potent being deregulation of the myc proto-oncogene. myc is a transcription factor, and its c-terminal domain is required for dimerization with its partner max and its subsequent binding to dna. it also possesses an n-terminal trans-activation domain that is required for both myc's biological activities of transcriptional activation and repression. activation by myc involves binding to the nuclear protein trrap, which recruits histone acetyltransferase complexes to myc activation targets. subsets of target genes include those that mediate cell cycle progression, cell growth, genomic instability, angiogenesis, and inhibit differentiation  <cit> . myc also acts as a repressor of a different set of targets, in addition to interfering with the function of activators such as miz <dig>  <cit> . myc binding to dna is dependent on chromatin context, such that myc sites having certain chromatin modifications are almost always bound, and myc sites lacking those certain modifications are rarely bound by myc  <cit> .

experiments in mammalian systems have answered many questions regarding myc biology, though their limitations in broad based discovery led us to investigate myc biology in drosophila. the dmyc protein is highly similar to c-myc in the residues required for dna binding, and the gene has a similar exon and intron structure  <cit> . dmyc can functionally replace c-myc in transformation assays with activated ras and in rescue experiments with mouse cells null for c-myc  <cit> . in drosophila, dmyc regulates rna pol i production of ribosomal rnas, is required for oogenesis and larval growth, and overexpression of dmyc in clones of the drosophila imaginal disc confers a growth advantage to cells having greater amounts of dmyc expression than their neighbors  <cit> .

in a transgenic mouse model using induction of myc in hepatocytes, the ability of myc to induce proliferation and tumorigenesis was shown to vary greatly depending on the age of the mouse at the time myc was induced, suggesting that the differentiation states of cells can mediate the response to myc  <cit> . in drosophila, differentiated or undifferentiated cell states are maintained by the polycomb group  and trithorax group  of proteins, which are thought to bind to repressed or activated loci, and thus to stabilize patterns of gene expression  <cit> . we reported previously that repression by myc in drosophila requires polycomb, a chromatin-binding transcriptional repressor  <cit> . previously characterized phenotypes manifested in pcg mutants reflect a loss of repression of homeotic genes, and the members of the pcg group were additionally defined by their ability to enhance each other's dominant phenotypes  <cit>  . conversely, mutant phenotypes of members of the trxg reflect a loss of activation of homeotic genes, and these mutations behave as suppressors of mutations in pc. many of the members of the pcg of proteins have been found in two separate protein complexes, prc <dig> and prc <dig>  neither of which bind to dna alone. prc <dig> includes pc, ph, psc and dring1; prc <dig> includes esc; a histone methyltransferase, e; and su <dig>  pcg proteins bind to hundreds of sites in the genomes of mammals and drosophila  <cit> , and repression of homeotic genes mediated by pcg proteins is experimentally linked to cis regulatory elements known as pres . the pcg proteins pho and dsfmbt bind to sites within pres, recruiting prc <dig>  followed by recruitment of prc <dig>  <cit> . trxg proteins bind to over  <dig> sites on polytene chromosomes and can be found in nucleosome remodeling complexes such as the bap complex . trx and ash <dig>  are set domain histone methyltransferases .

repression by myc requires pc for many targets, which includes the dmyc locus itself  <cit> . in the present study, we describe a novel genetic assay that we use to find additional drosophila gene products involved in repression of the dmyc gene. using this assay, we screened the drosophila genome for modifiers of dmyc expression. we then used rnai to deplete levels of our genetic modifiers, ash <dig> and pho, in the embryo and used affymetrix microarrays to analyze gene expression changes in these embryos with or without ectopic myc. our genetic and genomic data allow us to describe the role of pho and ash <dig> in myc-mediated repression and in control of myc trans-activation targets in the embryo. these data provide the first evidence for a functional link between canonical pc and trx group proteins.

RESULTS
pho and psc are involved in repression of dmyc
pc binds to methylated histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig> , mediating repression of many genetic loci by myc  <cit> . in an investigation of other pcg gene products potentially involved in this repression by myc and pc, we chose three candidates to test: posterior sex combs , which is in a core repressive complex with pc  <cit> ; e, which is a histone methyltransferase that methylates histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> and recruits pc repression  <cit> ; and pho, which is one of two dna-binding proteins of the group and recruits e  <cit> . our strategy for testing psc, e and pho involved a genetic test for modification of expression at the dmyc locus. each of two different p element insertions in the dmyc locus, dmycbg <dig> and dmycbg <dig>  provides two reporters for dmyc expression: a promoterless yeast gal <dig> gene that is expressed by the upstream dmyc promoter, and a drosophila eye color mini-white gene whose expression is influenced by the regulation of the locus   <cit> .

we first determined whether these reporters were sensitive to the regulation of the dmyc gene, using the phenomenon of dmyc autorepression. in this assay, ectopic dmyc leads to a reduction in the expression from the endogenous locus  <cit> . we obtained high levels of ectopic myc in embryos with the dmycbg <dig> allele . we collected rna from dmycbg <dig> embryos with or without ectopic dmyc and used rt-pcr to amplify transcripts from the gal <dig> and mini-white reporters, the first exon of dmyc , and a loading control, dras. expression of endogenous dmyc in embryos with the p-element insertion is normal, and northern blotting indicates that the mature transcript size is the same as in wild type . endogenous dmyc expression detected by rt-pcr in embryos with ectopic myc was close to zero , indicating that autorepression is intact in dmycbg <dig> embryos. phosphorimaging data revealed a reproducible reduction in both mini-white and gal <dig> expression in embryos with ectopic dmyc . the effect was small but striking, given that the embryos contain sources of mini-white and gal <dig> in addition to those from the insertion in dmyc . these results provided the molecular validation for our genetic strategy, linking dmyc regulation to the expression of the reporters within the locus.

we reasoned that reducing the dosage of a gene involved in dmyc repression might elevate the mini-white expression above that normally observed in dmycbg <dig> and dmycbg <dig> flies. therefore, we generated flies with mutations in candidate dmyc repressors combined with the dmyc reporters and examined levels of mini-white expression . heterozygosity  for a pc mutation did not increase mini-white levels of dmycbg <dig> males, but did affect mini-white levels of dmycbg <dig> . heterozygosity for a psc mutation affected both insertions in dmyc, increasing the mini-white levels compared to those of the non-mutant siblings in both cases . males heterozygous for either of two different loss-of-function alleles of e, e <dig> and e <dig>  did not increase mini-white levels of either insertion in dmyc; e males and non-mutant male siblings had indistinguishable mini-white intensities. males heterozygous for a hypomorphic mutation in pho, pho <dig>  had greater numbers of males with dark eyes than their non-mutant siblings, with 57% of pho <dig> heterozygotes having dark eyes compared to 5% of the non-mutant flies having dark eyes . therefore, we considered dmycbg <dig> to be the more sensitive reporter for dmyc expression because it revealed regulation by pc. psc and pho mutations affected both insertions, suggesting their involvement in pc/myc repression. however, neither insertion was affected by e mutations, suggesting that e may not be involved in repression by myc or that mutations in e are not haploinsufficient with respect to myc activity.

p values were computed using a chi-square test statistic. the asterisk refers to the combination of pc <dig> and dmycbg <dig>  rather than dmycbg <dig> 

pho participates with pc in repression of myc targets
the pho protein is thought to recruit pc to pres  <cit>  and in that way facilitates pc's repressive activity. requirements for pho activity might therefore be expected to parallel those for pc with respect to repression by myc, as suggested by our mini-white assay described above. to examine this possibility, we injected embryos with dsrna directed at pho, reducing transcript levels 6-fold . we also induced rnai for pho in embryos with ectopic myc to examine the role that pho has in myc function. in addition to pho rnai, we repeated the pc rnai experiment  for comparison using the drosophila genome  <dig>  affymetrix arrays . as described previously  <cit> , we also injected embryos with buffer for our controls, injected  <dig> embryos for each array hybridization, and duplicated the entire experiment, for a total of  <dig> injected embryos analyzed per genetic condition. we injected pre-cellularization embryos, and allowed them to age for  <dig> hours at 18°c before isolating rna. this technique of using rnai rather than known mutations in pho and pc for our microarray analysis has several advantages. first, variability between genetic backgrounds is eliminated, since genetically identical mothers provided the embryos for our experiments from array to array, no matter what gene we depleted by rnai or whether the fathers provided ectopic myc or not . second, transgene expression is constant from chip to chip because we used the identical gal <dig> source and uas-dmyc for all experiments, without concern for the logistics of combining three different genetic situations in one set of embryos. third, because we reduced both maternal and zygotic transcripts by rnai, our experiments did not require that we generate germ line clones to eliminate the maternal contribution of transcripts.

our experiments reveal  <dig> target genes that appear to be repressed by pho in normal embryos, since their levels increase following pho rnai . a larger number of pc repression targets were identified following pc rnai , and consistent with the view that pc and pho work together, the two groups of targets show substantial overlap;  <dig> of the  <dig> pho targets are also pc targets . that the remaining  <dig> pho targets do not appear to overlap pc targets may reflect the limitations of the threshold techniques used to identify targets in our experiments. it may also reflect differences of specific targets in their sensitivity to reductions in pc and pho . the shared regulatory roles of pc and pho extend beyond normal development to those  <dig> genes that are repressed in embryos following ectopic myc accumulation .  <dig> of these are no longer repressed to the same degree in the absence of pho, and  <dig> are no longer repressed to the same degree in the absence of pc . these genes that fail to be repressed in the absence of pc or pho do not overlap completely.  <dig> are affected by pc and pho similarly,  <dig> are affected by pc and not pho, and  <dig> are affected by pho and not pc. we conclude that normal levels pho and pc are required for myc's repressive activity, though not necessarily at the same time.

genes in each list are shown for their membership in every other list.

we examined the possibility that pc mediates its repressive effects upon dmyc targets by utilizing previously characterized polycomb responsive elements . the location of both pc and myc repressed genes, however, provides no evidence of close proximity to each other . because we were able to map target genes to chromosomes using genespring with affymetrix drosophila genome  <dig> data and not genome  <dig> , we used our previous set of pc repressed genes to compare to the locations of likely pres  <cit> . we compared the genomic locations of  <dig> pc repressed genes to the genomic locations of experimentally determined pc binding sites  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> pc responsive genes in our data overlap pc binding sites, and  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> are within two cytological number divisions of pc binding sites for one set of published data   <cit> . compared to a different set of published pc binding sites,  <dig> of  <dig> pc responsive genes of our set are within pc binding sites  <cit> . the overlap is small, though interestingly, the overlap of the two previously published pc binding sites with each other is also small: just  <dig> of  <dig> genes with pc binding sites in our set is common to the data sets of both schwartz et. al. and tolhuis et. al. a third set of mapped pc binding sites describes many fewer pc binding sites, and two of those overlap our pc responsive genes  <cit> ; these two are also described as being pc binding sites by swartz et. al. . we conclude that pc binding is dynamic, with no absolute set of pc binding sites. each set of data is a snapshot of the current and changing position of pc, and our gene expression data is consistent with the dynamic and possibly stochastic nature of pc binding to the genome.

our previous experiments indicated that many of the genes activated by myc are normally repressed by pc  <cit> . we were curious whether pho repression overlapped myc activation to the same extent. the levels of  <dig> transcripts increase with ectopic myc. of the  <dig> genes whose levels increase with pho rnai,  <dig> are among the  <dig> myc activation targets . therefore, a substantial role for pho in normal embryos is to repress genes that can be activated by ectopic myc.

we examined our embryonic myc activation targets for the presence of transcription factor binding sites. using p-match to search our sequences for known transcription factor binding sites within the transfac database  <cit> , we found  <dig> of  <dig> myc induced targets that have canonical vertebrate myc-binding e-boxes from the  <dig> position through the first exon. e-boxes in drosophila are most likely to be found from - <dig> to + <dig>  with the majority between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the lack of e-boxes may simply reflect the nature of our embryonic myc targets, which exclude those that are maternally deposited because those transcripts are present in both our experimental and control embryos. it is possible that our zygotic myc targets are part of a different set that are induced by non-canonical binding sites. among drosophila genes bound by dam-myc, 95% of the sites identified at those loci were not the canonical cacgtg  <cit> . we did find, however, many myc activated transcripts with vertebrate yy <dig> sites, which is the homolog of drosophila pho. the mammalian transcription factor yy <dig> is able to bind to pres and recruit pc repression in drosophila  <cit> , and  <dig> of  <dig> myc activated genes have yy <dig> sites. to determine the significance of this number, we used p-match to search the sequences of  <dig> random drosophila genes, and  <dig> of those have yy <dig> sites as well. therefore, we considered the appearance of  <dig> yy <dig> sites in our set of  <dig> myc activated genes to be similar to what is found randomly.

mutations in ash <dig> cause increased expression of the dmyc gene
to search for other components that might mediate a pho/myc/pc interaction, we conducted an unbiased genetic screen of large deletions on the second and third chromosomes . because dmycbg <dig> flies have a darker eye color that is easier to score than dmycbg <dig>  we used dmycbg <dig> in our screen. out of a total of  <dig> deficiency mutants ,  <dig> scored as decreasing mini-white levels of dmycbg <dig> and  <dig> scored as increasing mini-white expression . among the latter dfs, we were particularly interested in the overlapping region of dfkt <dig> and dfxs <dig> because it includes ash <dig>  a histone methyltransferase  <cit> . we tested specific ash <dig> mutants for their ability to recapitulate the phenotype seen in the two overlapping deficiencies and found that 69% of ash1re <dig> mutant males had darker mini-white compared to 8% of their non-mutant siblings . to be sure that the mutations that scored as affecting the insertion in dmyc were indeed affecting dmyc expression and not mini-white in general, we conducted independent control crosses of a mini-white p element insertion  on the x chromosome, bg <dig>  to every mutation and deficiency that scored positive in our assay. we found that  <dig> deficiencies affected this non-dmyc mini-white insertion and ruled them out. the rest, including pc, psc,pho and ash <dig>  did not affect mini-white levels of the non-dmyc associated insertion . therefore, our genetic assay provided a dna binding protein  and a histone methyltransferase  as potential mediators of myc-pc activity.

depletion of ash <dig> and pc in the embryo results in similar gene expression changes
although ash <dig> appears to be involved in repression of dmyc with pho and pc in our mini-white assay, it is known as a trithorax group gene. ash <dig> mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions suggest that, at least with respect to homeotic loci, it works in opposition to the activity of the pc group  <cit> . to examine the full range of functions for ash <dig>  beyond regulation of the homeotic selector genes, we conducted microarray experiments comparing gene expression changes between embryos with wild type and reduced levels of ash <dig>  we injected embryos with dsrna directed at ash <dig>  reducing transcript levels 2-fold . we also induced rnai for ash <dig> in embryos with ectopic myc to examine the role that ash <dig> has in myc function. the experiments were conducted the same way as described above for pho rnai.

we first characterized ash1's potential repressive activity in the embryo, determining whether ash <dig> rnai causes increased expression of certain transcripts and whether those targets overlap myc or pc activities. we found that levels of  <dig> genes increase with ash <dig> rnai, suggesting that ash <dig> behaves directly or indirectly as a repressor in the embryo .  <dig> of these  <dig> genes are activated by myc . the overlap parallels our previous findings with pc and pho, and suggests that, in the embryo, a significant role of ash <dig>  pho and pc is to control the expression of targets that are activated by ectopic myc. in addition, we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> ash <dig> repression targets are also pc repression targets . this overlap is at least as large as that observed for pho and pc and provides the first molecular link between pc and a trxg protein in repression. this link may be the result of either direct or indirect activities of pc and ash <dig>  the overlap of pc/pho and ash <dig> repression targets is not limited to genes activated by myc.  <dig> of the  <dig> non-myc targets repressed by ash <dig> are also repressed by pc or pho.

the genetic assay that revealed that ash <dig> is involved in myc biology was one assessing repression of the dmyc locus. therefore, we examined the  <dig> myc repressed genes for any requirement of ash <dig> in that repression. in an embryo with ectopic myc and ash <dig> rnai,  <dig> of those genes remain repressed  suggesting that ash <dig> is required for myc repression at only a small fraction of its targets . in contrast,  <dig> of the same  <dig> myc repressed targets were no longer repressed to the same degree when pc levels were reduced. this effect is more pronounced than that of ash <dig> and may indicate a more direct role for pc in myc repression. these numbers do not represent absolute repression by ash <dig> and pc, however, given that the rnai depletion of these transcripts was not complete. in fact, pc levels were reduced  <dig> fold more than ash <dig> transcripts, as measured by microarray.

ectopic myc replaces ash <dig> in activation
consistent with ash1's known role in gene activation, levels of  <dig> genes decrease in response to ash <dig> rnai , an effect that is superficially similar to the positive role of ash <dig> in regulating homeotic gene activity.  <dig> of these  <dig> genes are also myc activation targets. in contrast, only  <dig> of  <dig> genes whose levels decrease with pc rnai are also myc activated . similarly, just  <dig> of  <dig> genes whose levels decrease with pho rnai are also myc activated , suggesting that pc and pho are unlikely to be functioning similarly to ash <dig> with respect to gene activation. given this overlap between activation targets of myc and ash <dig>  we hypothesized that ectopic myc might rescue the loss of activation that occurs with ash <dig> rnai. if this were the case, we would expect that genes whose levels decrease with ash <dig> rnai alone would in fact increase with ash <dig> rnai and ectopic myc. consistent with this notion, we found that levels of  <dig> of these  <dig> genes are significantly elevated above basal levels in embryos with both ectopic myc and ash <dig> rnai, and expression of  <dig> genes is at basal levels . only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes whose levels are reduced with ash <dig> rnai remain reduced in the presence of ectopic myc. therefore, a large majority of genes that are activated by ash <dig> are not only myc activated, but myc can replace ash <dig> in their activation. these results also suggest that, while ash <dig> is important in the activation of these genes, they do not require wild type levels of ash <dig> to be activated by myc.

ash <dig> is required for myc activation
we were curious about the inverse, whether ash <dig> is required for activation by myc. levels of  <dig> genes increase upon activation of ectopic myc. in embryos with both ectopic myc and ash <dig> rnai, levels of  <dig> of these genes fail to increase at the same level . none of these  <dig> genes is also regulated by ash <dig> alone, suggesting that ash1's regulation of these genes is limited to activation by myc. upon closer examination of the  <dig> genes, we found a cluster of  <dig> that are regulated by pc and pho . the regulation of these genes by pc and pho is negative, in that the targets have elevated expression with pc or pho rnai . therefore, many of these targets are normally repressed by pc/pho. among the named genes in this group, several encode structural constituents, such as ccp84ac , dhc62b  and actin 88f, and some are involved in metabolism, such as glycogenin and lipase <dig>  one possible explanation for the regulation of these myc targets is that the role of ash <dig> is to oppose pc/pho repression, allowing myc activation. in fact, ash <dig> opposes pc repression at homeotic loci  <cit> . therefore, our data suggest that ash <dig> also opposes pc repression at loci activated by myc .

myc targets exhibit disparate histone modifications
in many of our experiments, pc, pho and ash <dig> proteins facilitate myc's activity as a repressor, but also appear to oppose its activity as an activator. in an attempt to understand how the same proteins cooperate with myc to repress one set of targets and conversely work to repress a different set of myc activation targets, we have to consider a major difference between myc's targets of activation and repression: before myc acts upon them, repression targets are necessarily being expressed while activation targets are largely unexpressed .

myc's embryonic targets of activation, prior to induction of ectopic myc, are expressed at low levels and our data show that pc, pho and ash <dig> are required to maintain that pattern of expression. to examine myc targets for hallmarks of both ash <dig> and pc activity, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to examine the methylation of histone tails in wild type embryos. because ash <dig> methylates h3k <dig>  a chromatin modification that correlates with mammalian targets of myc activation  <cit> , and pho and pc are involved in setting up and binding to h3k <dig> methylation, respectively, we used sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine whether myc activation targets in the embryo exhibit both methylation marks. using chromatin from wild type embryos, obtained over a  <dig> hour room temperature collection, we immunoprecipitated with anti-dimethyl h3k <dig>  purified the chromatin, and immunoprecipitated again with anti-trimethyl h3k <dig>  we also performed the reciprocal experiment, beginning with anti-trimethyl h3k <dig> and following with anti-dimethyl h3k <dig> . we used pcr to detect three different genes that are myc activated, pc, ash <dig> and pho repressed n, and alpha tubulin 67c, figure 8b–c). all three of these genes were amplified from our sequential chip dna, arguing that they are modified on both h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  as a control, we examined a gene that is not regulated by myc, pc, ash <dig> or pho  and found it absent in our sequential chip dna, though it is expressed at high levels in the embryo and methylated at h3k <dig> . in addition, we tested two genes that are pc and myc repressed , and they show both h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation individually in chromatin from wild type embryos. this result is not unexpected, since we obtained the chromatin from all the cells of wild type embryos, so that different cells may be expressing or repressing each gene. we found that these loci are not methylated at both residues simultaneously, because we failed to amplify either gene from our sequential chip dna . these results, along with our genetic and genomic data, support a model for the control of myc targets in the embryo, in which ash <dig>  pc and pho are required for the low levels of expression of these genes, reflected by the disparate chromatin methylation of targets of myc activation . developmentally regulated genes in mammalian embryonic stem cells also exhibit low levels of expression prior to differentiation, corresponding to methylation of both h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  <cit> .

myc repression targets, different from activation targets, are expressed in the embryo prior to ectopic myc induction . bracken and colleagues have shown that pcg proteins bind at expressed loci prior to differentiation and repression, and those sites also have h3k <dig> methylation  <cit> . we have observed h3k <dig> methylation of myc targets in wild type embryos , suggesting that they are primed for repression, and upon ectopic myc induction pho and pc work to repress these targets. the role of ash <dig> in repression of these targets may be limited to the embryo, possibly to allow for trans-activation in the event of an activation signal, rather than a less reversible pc-mediated silenced state .

discussion
the requirement for ash <dig> in activation and maintenance of non-activation
our genetic assay for modification of expression of the dmyc locus enabled us to identify an unexpected interaction, namely that gene regulation by ash <dig> in the embryo overlaps gene regulation by myc, pc and pho. we found that a deletion of ash <dig> leads to greater expression of a mini-white reporter within the dmyc locus, which potentially reflects repression of dmyc in the eye imaginal disc. in addition, ash <dig> rnai in the embryo causes the induction of  <dig> genes. interestingly, homeotic transformations in flies mutant for ash <dig> are enhanced by mutations in psc  <cit> , a pcg gene that is part of the core repressive complex including pc  <cit> . thus, the current understanding of ash <dig> as a nuclear protein involved in the complex regulation of cellular memory does not exclude the possibility that ash <dig> may be involved in repression of certain genes, directly or indirectly. ash <dig> was identified as a late larval lethal mutation with imaginal disc defects  <cit> . expression of homeotic selector genes in ash <dig> mutants is affected differently in different cells, with stochastic loss of expression  <cit>  apparently caused by ectopic silencing by pc-g proteins  <cit> . flies heterozygous for a mutation in ash <dig> show homeotic transformations when the fly is also heterozygous for another trxg mutation  <cit> . this intergenic non-complementation indicates that levels of trxg proteins are important, which is supported by the large genomic effects we describe with just a 2-fold reduction in ash <dig> transcripts. the ash <dig> protein is a set domain histone methyltransferase that methylates lysines  <dig> and  <dig> of histone h <dig> and lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  and these combined activities are correlated with active transcription  <cit> . interestingly, methylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> is reduced in the chromocenter of polytene chromosomes in ash <dig> mutants lacking the set domain  <cit> , and h3k <dig> methylation is associated with hp- <dig> binding and heterochromatin formation  <cit> . in addition, ash <dig> binds to  <dig> bands on polytene chromosomes, several of which overlap or are adjacent to binding sites of psc  <cit> . we found that among the  <dig> genes that are up-regulated with ash <dig> rnai,  <dig> are also up-regulated with pc rnai,  <dig> are up-regulated with pho rnai, with  <dig> of these genes common to all three. these results suggest that ash <dig> methylation is not exclusive to transcriptional activation.

ash <dig> also appears to be involved in activation of a different set of embryonic targets, and many of the genes in this set overlap myc activation targets. in fact, we found that ectopic myc can replace ash <dig> in embryos with both ash <dig> rnai and ectopic myc by activating 76% of the genes whose expression decreases with ash <dig> rnai alone. in addition, we argue that ash <dig> is required in myc activation of a subset of its targets, presumably by antagonizing pc/pho repression. h3k <dig> methylation is correlated with myc binding to high affinity target sites, and this methylation occurs in the absence of myc protein, suggesting that it is established and then myc is able to bind  <cit> . ash <dig> may function to maintain a favorable methylation state of myc targets, allowing subsequent activation by myc.

we found minimal direct overlap of ash <dig> activation with pc and pho repression. our threshold values for determining genes affected by each genetic condition likely caused false negative results; in addition, ash <dig> transcript levels were not depleted as effectively as pc or pho levels. our experiments were conducted with rna from entire embryos, therefore we cannot determine the segment-specific regulation by the genes that we tested, and the overlap of pc and pho repression with ash <dig> activation would be expected to occur in a segment-specific manner. following that argument, the large overlap of ash <dig>  pc and pho repression targets may be related to universal genetic programs, including myc transcriptional activation, in contrast to the cell-type specific programs, such as those under the control of homeotic genes.

pho's activity overlaps myc targets better than pc targets
we found many of the transcripts that are de-repressed by pho rnai overlap those that are de-repressed by pc rnai, but more of the pho targets overlap those that are myc activated than pc repressed. our stringent statistical requirement for the membership of any transcript in a list of genes that increase or decrease in response to a particular genetic condition may reduce our view of the overlap of genes regulated by both pc and pho. but a difference in the effects of loss of pc and loss of pho is not unprecedented. pho mutants have segmental transformations similar to those of pc mutants, however these mutations have either little or no effect on expression of abd-a, abd-b or ubx in embryos  <cit> . and yet, pho is required for silencing of the iab- <dig> pre  <cit>  and is necessary, though not sufficient, for the silencing activity of the mcp element of the abd-b gene  <cit> . our data and the earlier experiments we described may reveal the redundancy of pho and pho-like, which is a homolog of pho and binds to the same sequence  <cit> . wang and colleagues found that pho-like recruits pcg complexes just as pho does in the wing imaginal disc  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data have revealed that there is tremendous overlap and plasticity of regulation by proteins whose functions have been thought to be disparate. we are left with a view of the embryonic genome in which the transcription factor myc is capable of activation and repression of many loci, and its canonical binding site is less important than the influence of proteins whose role in biology is to maintain cell fates. the methylation status of chromatin surrounding myc targets supports the notion that the nucleus of a wild type embryo is primed to control its response to a transcription factor such as myc.
