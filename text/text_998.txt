BACKGROUND
almond  d. a. webb) is an ancient plant species domesticated by humans initially in the middle east. p. fenzliana or p. communis have been considered its most likely wild ancestors  <cit> . valued for its health benefits and high nutritional value, the importance of the crop is increasing in the human diet, and consequently its production and commercial value are growing worldwide. despite a high genetic similarity to peach, almonds have a fleshless fruit and edible kernel, rather than an edible fruit. many agronomic traits important to almond such as shell hardness, kernel taste, kernel weight, resistance to biotic/abiotic stress, blooming time and self-incompatibility have been investigated, and efforts towards mapping and molecular characterisation of these genes have been made  <cit> . with the aid of the peach genome sequence released recently  <cit> , characterisation of the almond genes responsible for agronomically important traits will become easier. however, well-assessed almond mapping populations and subsequent genetic maps are still fundamental for investigations of the genetic and molecular control of important traits.

a saturated linkage map can be a useful tool in the study of plant genetics and breeding. close associations between important traits and molecular markers can assist fast selection of plants with desired features at early stages of growth. this is particularly valuable for breeding programs of woody plants because conventional, phenotype-based selection in these is delayed due to a long juvenile stage. arùs et al.  first reported a linkage map in a 'ferragnes' × 'tuono'  almond population with rflp and isozyme markers, where the map distance was omitted  <cit> . later the density and coverage of the map was improved by the addition of more markers  <cit> . ballester  constructed a molecular genetic map of a cross 'felisia' × 'bertina'   <cit> , and later a late bloom gene was mapped in the population  <cit> . sánchez-pérez et al.  mapped  <dig> traits  in a cross of 'r1000' × 'desmayo largueta'  with  <dig> ssrs in the map  <cit> . however, more mapping populations and saturated maps are required to assist broader assessment of the almond traits and gene discovery especially under different environments and management systems. in australia, a genetic linkage mapping program was initiated by gregory  <cit>  in a 'nonpareil' × 'lauranne' cross , but the integrated map with mainly rapds and issrs was sparse and further saturation was desirable  <cit> . recently, wu et al.  reported that  <dig> snp-anchored genes were mapped on six linkage groups in the same population with a higher map density  <cit> . genetic maps have also been constructed in crosses between almond and peach including 'texas'x'earlygold'   <cit> , 'garfi'x'nemared'   <cit> , 'padre' × '54p455'   <cit>  and a derivative population from gxn  <cit> . the most important map is the t × e map that has been generally accepted as a marker-saturated prunus reference map. this map has been used to position genes corresponding to  <dig> ests  <cit> , locate  <dig> putative resistance regions  <cit> , and align  <dig> rosaceaous unigenes that correspond to single copy arabidopsis genes  <cit> : the rosaceae conserved orthologous set  map. a number of qtl have also been mapped using the t × e map  <cit> .

in this study, we developed a moderately saturated linkage map by adding ssrs and snps to the n × l f <dig> map constructed by gregory et al.   <cit> . the map was compared with the prunus t × e reference map to demonstrate high synteny and colinearity between the n × l and the reference map. the sequences of the gene-anchored snps  <cit>  were also compared to the peach genome v <dig>  and the mapped positions generally agreed with the peach genome positions. the n × l genetic map reported here can be used to investigate traits of interest under the southern australian winter rainfall inland environment, and provides more almond genome information for the international community.

RESULTS
marker polymorphism
altogether,  <dig> markers were polymorphic in the population under analysis. of these,  <dig>  were heterozygous in both parents,  <dig> with  <dig> alleles,  <dig> with  <dig> alleles, and  <dig> with  <dig> alleles;  <dig>  were heterozygous only in nonpareil; and  <dig>  were heterozygous only in lauranne. ssr markers bppct <dig>  cpdct <dig>  cpsct <dig> and udap- <dig> demonstrated multi-locus amplifications, each with two loci, across the population. the mapping results  indicated, however, that the loci of bppct <dig> were located closely in the same linkage group at a distance of  <dig>  cm.

segregation of the markers
of  <dig> markers analysed,  <dig>  segregated in the expected mendelian segregation ratios, and  <dig>  showed skewed segregations , with 19/ <dig>  ssr, 6/ <dig>  issr, 5/ <dig>  rapd, and 2/ <dig>  snp markers showing skewed ratios. following grouping of the markers in the mapping process, 10/ <dig>  of the markers appearing in linkage group  <dig>  had skewed segregation ratios, which was extremely high compared to the average across other groups 22/ <dig> . interestingly, the only two skewed snp markers were grouped in g <dig>  to avoid using too few markers for a framework construction, all the skewed markers in g <dig> were included in the first step of mapping, and second step mapping for this group was omitted.

a plot of negative log <dig> of p-values  in χ <dig> tests comparing frequencies of alleles of the loci in the g <dig> versus their map positions is shown in figure  <dig>  a main peak was identified in the area between markers cppct <dig> and n- <dig>  while a few markers with low -log <dig> values were present in the adjacent areas of the peak, a trend that the -log <dig> values declined gradually towards two ends of the linkage group was clearly illustrated.

linkage maps constructed using one-step and two-step methods
a final linkage map of  <dig>  cm containing  <dig> markers  was constructed using the one-step method of joinmap® . the average marker distance of the map was  <dig>  cm, and  <dig> skewed markers were mapped in the genome of the population. individually, g <dig> was the longest group covering  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers. g <dig> was the shortest group covering  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers. the average marker distance varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   cm. as indicated previously, g <dig> mapped the highest number of segregation ratio skewed markers , whereas g <dig> had no skewed markers in the group.

using the two-step method, the final map was  <dig>  cm contained  <dig> markers  . the average marker distance of this map was  <dig>  cm and  <dig> skewed markers were included in the map. similar to the one-step map, g <dig> was the longest group at  <dig> cm containing  <dig> markers. g <dig> was the shortest group at  <dig>  cm containing  <dig> markers. the average marker distance varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . as with the one-step method, g <dig> had the highest number of skewed markers  whereas g <dig> had no skewed markers mapped.

for most of the markers, the two methods produced consistent mapping results as shown in figure  <dig>  the linkage groups g <dig> and g <dig> produced by the one-step and two-step methods were completely collinear with no rearranged linkage order. other linkage groups had one or more markers in different map order in the two maps. although the divergence in positions were not substantial for most markers, seven markers showed shifts larger than  <dig> cm, i.e., ct8g- <dig> in g <dig>  uda- <dig> and ag8yc- <dig> in g <dig>  cpdct <dig> in g <dig>  ag8yc- <dig> in g <dig> and ag8ya- <dig> and opa08- <dig> in g <dig> with shifts of:  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm, and  <dig>  cm respectively. among these, ct8g- <dig>  cpdct <dig>  ag8yc- <dig> and ag8ya- <dig> showed significantly skewed segregation ratios, and most  were dominant markers . the segment from marker udap-479a to marker cppct <dig> of g <dig>  and from marker ca8t- <dig> to marker udp96- <dig> of g <dig>  was inverted between the two maps.

among the markers mapped in the n × l population, the issrs were developed in our initial analysis, and therefore were newly mapped markers in the p. dulcis map. the ssrs were identified from published studies, and the majority of the markers mapped in the same linkage groups as previously reported. however, a few ssr markers were mapped for the first time: cpdct <dig> on g <dig>  cpdct <dig> on g <dig>  and cpdct <dig> on g <dig>  moreover, some markers amplified more loci in the n × l population than in the previous report or mapped to different linkage groups. cpdct <dig> mapped to g <dig> in the t × e reference map  <cit>  and the "contender" × "fla.92-2c" peach map  <cit>  as a single locus marker. the primers for this marker amplified two loci in the n × l population, which mapped to g <dig> and g <dig>  primers for udap- <dig> also amplified two loci, which mapped to g <dig> and g <dig> in our study. a recent report identified four loci for uda- <dig> in the apricot population "z506-07"  × "currot"  and all four loci were assigned to g <dig>  <cit> . two loci of bppct <dig> were mapped to g <dig> of the peach "ferjalou jalousia" × "fantasia"  <cit>  and t × e reference maps  <cit>  for locus a, and g <dig> of the "ferjalou jalousia" × "fantasia" map  <cit>  and g <dig> of the t × e reference map  <cit>  for locus b. in contrast, two loci for bppct <dig> were mapped to g <dig> of our mapping population in an interval of  <dig>  cm.

in the maps constructed by both methods, gaps bigger than  <dig> cm were observed . these included one gap on g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  and three gaps on g <dig> in the one-step map, and one gap on g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig>  two gaps on g <dig>  and three gaps on g <dig> and g <dig> in the two-step map. the two-step map had more gaps  of >  <dig> cm than the one-step map . the biggest gap  was between the markers udap- <dig> and cpsct <dig> on g <dig> of the one-step map.

synteny of the n × l and t × e maps and between the almond and peach genomes
the almond n × l and prunus t × e reference genetic maps were compared using common ssr markers to visualise the syntenic regions. as shown in figure  <dig>  a high degree of macro-synteny between n × l and t × e was evident across the whole genome with  <dig> common ssr markers. for example, the linkage groups g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> did not show any order conflict between the n × l and t × e maps. despite the high degree of macro-synteny, rearrangements of markers in small sections occurred in the other linkage groups. furthermore, a few markers showed inconsistency of position over larger distances between the n × l and t × e maps. for instance, the marker cpsct <dig> mapped to the top of g <dig> in the n × l maps , while it was located in the middle segment of t × e  <dig>  cm from the top. the marker cpdct <dig> was mapped to the upper part  or the lower part  of g <dig> but to the lower middle part in t × e. with reference to the t × e map, the n × l map coverage of the genome varied with linkage groups. g <dig> and g <dig> covered the whole length of the corresponding groups of t × e; g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig> covered most of their corresponding groups with one end or both ends having no common markers with t × e but covering equivalent lengths; g <dig> and g <dig> had fewer markers in common with the t × e map but comparison with maps in the gdr database http://www.rosaceae.org <cit>  indicated full coverage of g4; and g <dig> alignment indicated that at least the bottom part of approximately  <dig> cm was not mapped in n × l. hence, this n × l map can be regarded as moderately saturated.

the sequences of fourteen snp-anchored genes were compared using blastn with the peach genome v <dig>  database, and homologous sequences were located in the scaffolds of the peach genome. as the scaffolds correspond to each of the linkage groups of prunus maps, the relative positions of the genes can be identified in the genome. the results showed that the locations of the majority of the genes mapped in the n × l population agreed with the positions of their homologous sequences in the corresponding peach genome scaffolds . awpm-19-like, however, was located near the top of g <dig> rather than in the lower middle part of the group, where the homologous sequence was identified in the peach genome scaffold_ <dig>  in g <dig>  the segment involving mt <dig>  dhn <dig> and ap <dig> showed inversion compared to the peach genome despite spanning only a small fragment with genetic distance of  <dig>  cm or dna length of  <dig>  mbp.

discussion
in this study, we constructed almond linkage maps of an australia population derived from the cross between the american cultivar 'nonpareil' as maternal parent and the french cultivar 'lauranne' as pollen donor . two maps were constructed using one-step and two-step methods, with total lengths of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively.  <dig> molecular markers were positioned on the one-step and  <dig> markers were positioned on the two-step map. the resulting maps showed high colinearity with the prunus t × e reference map  <cit> .

to obtain an integrated map of a cross pollinated population, individual parental maps were generally constructed and then integrated to produce a consensus map of the population by estimation of the average recombination frequency of the loci in the two parents, as has been used for other pseudo-test cross mapping populations in many tree species  <cit> . in this study, we denoted this as the two-step method. since the release of joinmap® version  <dig>  <cit> , the construction of an integrated map of the population can be undertaken by loading all the genotyping data of the population, bypassing individual parental map construction in a one-step strategy. genetic maps constructed in this way have been published in recent years  <cit> . during initial mapping analysis, we tried both the one-step and two-step methods, and variations of marker distances and positions were identified. as the comparison studies had not been reported, we applied both methods in our n × l almond population to investigate whether different methods yield significantly different maps. based on our study, these two integration methods did not result in substantial differences for all the linkage groups, and only a small proportion of markers showed positional instability between the two maps. the majority of the markers  that had a position shift of greater than  <dig> cm between two maps showed skewed segregation ratios or were adjacent to markers with skewed segregation. the fewer large gaps generated in the one-step map suggest that the one-step mapping is an appropriate method to construct an integrated map of a pseudo-test cross population such as in the almond and other tree plants. therefore, in this study, the one-step map was used to represent the n × l genome for other analyses .

linkage maps based on intraspecific crosses of almond have been reported for the crosses of 'ferragnes' × 'tuono'   <cit> , 'felisia' × 'bertina'   <cit> , 'r1000' × 'desmayo largueta'   <cit> , and 'nonpareil × lauranne'   <cit> . while f × t and f × b maps consisted mostly of rflp and rapd markers, the rxd map contains  <dig> ssr markers with less density across the genome. ssrs are the favoured marker type used for many applications in plant genetics including genetic mapping because of easy transferability between intraspecific populations and across closely related species, and a high number of alleles per locus that provides greater information content  <cit> . therefore, a saturated map containing additional ssr markers is warranted in almond intraspecific crosses. the n × l map was initiated with rapds, issrs and the small numbers of ssr, and a sparse integrated map was subsequently produced  <cit> . using high resolution melting curve analysis  <cit> , wu et al. mapped  <dig> gene-anchored snps on six linkage groups plus the addition of more ssr to the map  <cit> . in the present study, we have constructed a combined molecular linkage map including ssr, snp, rapd, and issr markers. in comparison with the prunus t × e reference map and other maps reported in prunus , the linkage groups of the n × l map covered close to the whole length of the almond linkage groups with the exception of g <dig> which requires further extension beyond epdcu <dig>  with reasonable dense coverage of the genome by ssrs and snps, the map can readily be used in the australian almond breeding program  <cit>  and contribute to international almond genome research.

the clustering of loci with skewed segregation ratios on g <dig> suggests a possible association of deleterious genes with this section of the linkage group and a more in depth study to investigate this possibility is warranted. in a peach f <dig> mapping population, no linkage of markers could be established for g <dig>  <cit>  possibly due to the complexity of marker segregation. in our study, more than half  of the mapped markers had significantly skewed segregation ratios, and most of the skewed markers clustered on the central section of the linkage group with a peak of segregation distortion around marker ma <dig>  this finding indicates that the area may harbour one or more deleterious genes. although some genes or traits related to biotic or abiotic stress have been mapped to this group such as the nematode resistance trait ma  <cit>  and the dhn gene involved in freezing and drought tolerance  <cit> , those genes were probably not the cause of the distorted segregations as these occur in a different region of g <dig>  it would be interesting to search for deleterious gene alleles in the region around ma <dig>  the recent release of peach genome v <dig>  provides a good opportunity for conducting such investigations.

with the release of a > <dig> fold coverage peach genome in april  <dig> , with  <dig>  genes predicted  <cit> , genomic exploration in prunus and more widely in the family rosaceae and perhaps other tree plants will accelerate. in the present study, we compared  <dig> snp-anchored genes mapped in the n × l population with the peach genome v <dig> . a high synteny between our map and the peach genome was observed as expected. however, an inversion was noted in a g <dig> segment including genes mt <dig>  dhn <dig>  and ap <dig>  the evidence for the inversion will become clearer when the almond genome is sequenced and a final sequence build is achieved in the future. nevertheless, as the closest relative of peach, genetic and genomic studies in almond will benefit significantly from the publication of the peach genome sequences prior to the complete sequencing of the almond genome. for almond researchers and breeders to fully utilise the sequence information becoming available for peach, well-assessed almond populations and genetic maps are required to associate important agronomic traits of the species with predicted genes in peach. development of saturated genetic marker maps such as that presented in this paper will be valuable for almond genetic research and breeding programs.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we presented a moderately saturated australian almond map, which is highly syntenic and collinear with the prunus t × e reference map and peach genome v <dig> . it was identified that a section of g <dig> with skewed markers may harbour one or more deleterious gene, and further investigation to search for such a gene is suggested. the comparison of one-step and two-step methods indicated that these two methods produced highly consistent maps, but one-step method was a preferred mapping approach. the well-assessed almond population reported here can be used to investigate the traits of interest under australian growing conditions, and provides more information on the almond genome for the international community.
