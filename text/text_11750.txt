BACKGROUND
aphids have a sophisticated feeding strategy in which they use their stylets to penetrate plant tissue and puncture cells along the intercellular pathway towards the phloem  <cit> . to facilitate the probing and feeding processes, aphids secrete saliva into the plant tissue to degrade cell walls and to overcome occlusion of the feeding site  <cit> . once an aphid establishes a feeding site it can feed from the phloem of a susceptible plant for hours or even days  <cit> . aphid infestation limits plant productivity due to the depletion of photo-assimilates and the deposition of excess sugars as honeydew that encourages growth of mold. in addition, aphids are important vectors of numerous plant viruses that can be transmitted during probing and feeding, resulting in additional damage to plants  <cit> .

plants have evolved a series of defense traits to directly affect the aphid’s feeding behavior. these defenses include physical and chemical traits that can be constitutively present or induced upon aphid attack  <cit> . physical traits, such as hairs and glandular trichomes, hinder aphid settling on a plant  <cit> . chemical traits include the production of secondary metabolites and proteins that are repellent or toxic to aphids thereby affecting their performance  <cit> . for example, the brassicaceous-specific secondary metabolites glucosinolates have been shown to negatively affect the performance of the generalist aphid myzus persicae  <cit> . contrary to constitutive traits, inducible defenses require recognition of the attacking aphid and subsequent transcriptional reprogramming. this also includes the activation of general wound responses. an increasing body of evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species , which were always thought to be induced as a general wound response, can play a role in plant defense towards aphids as well  <cit> . for example, an early accumulation of ros upon russian wheat aphid infestation was suggested to be a defense response in aphid resistant wheat  <cit> . in contrast, an increasing concentration of ascorbic acid, a compound that is capable of reducing ros, leads to an enhanced aphid fecundity  <cit> , further underpinning the role of ros in plant defense towards aphids. moreover, ros can act as signaling molecules, along with ja, to confer aphid resistance  <cit> . the activation of plant hormone pathways, especially jasmonic acid , salicylic acid  and ethylene , plays an important role in plant defense against aphids  <cit> . these pathways interact in a network, regulating the expression of specific groups of defense-related genes  <cit> . although all pathways can be involved in defense, the ja pathway is thought to be the most effective against aphids  <cit> . constitutive activation of the ja pathway in an arabidopsis thaliana mutant leads to enhanced aphid resistance, whereas blocking the ja pathway results in aphid susceptibility  <cit> .

it has been shown that certain genes, for instance iqd <dig>  and mpl <dig>  can confer plant resistance to insects when their level of expression is increased or the location of expression is changed . such genes may be identified by screening activation tag mutant collections for insect resistance  <cit> . in these mutants, tagged genes are overexpressed by a tetramer cauliflower mosaic virus  35s enhancer adjacent to the natural promoter, resulting in a dominant gain-of-function phenotype  <cit> . by screening such a mutant collection of a. thaliana, we have identified several mutants with enhanced resistance against m. persicae  <cit> . in the present paper we characterize one of these mutants, leading to the identification of sku <dig> similar  <dig>  as a gene responsible for enhanced resistance to m. persicae. we analyzed the feeding behavior of m. persicae on the mutant using the electrical penetration graph  technique  <cit>  to get information about the location of resistance factors. based on the putative involvement of sks <dig> in oxidation/reduction reactions we visualized the accumulation of ros in leaves. finally, we monitored the expression of several ja-, sa, and ethylene-pathway marker genes to study the possible interaction of sks <dig> with these hormone pathways that may explain the aphid resistance conferred by sks <dig> overexpression.

RESULTS

mutant  <dig> was previously identified as an arabidopsis thaliana activation tag mutant on which myzus persicae shows a longer pre-reproductive period and produces smaller numbers of offspring than on its corresponding wild type wassilewskija   <cit> . compared to ws, mutant  <dig> has smaller and darker green colored leaves , shows a delayed flowering, a reduced height of the main stem and an increased number of lateral branches.figure  <dig>

identification of sks <dig> as a gene conferring enhanced resistance to m. persicae
using inverse pcr we could determine that mutant  <dig> contains a t-dna including a 35s enhancer that is located on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> , <dig>  in the 3’-utr region of the brassinosteroid receptor like gene . additionally, two other genes, sku <dig> similar  <dig>  and sku <dig> similar  <dig>  are located within a distance of approximately  <dig> kb of the enhancer , a distance over which the enhancer can effectively activate the expression of genes  <cit> . to determine whether the transcript levels of these three genes were affected by the enhancer, we first performed quantitative rt-pcr . the transcript level of brl <dig> was two-fold higher in mutant  <dig> than in ws . no transcripts of sks <dig> and sks <dig> were detectable in ws but they could clearly be detected in mutant  <dig> .figure  <dig>

as a. thaliana knockout mutants for many genes are publically available, we determined whether impaired expression of brl <dig> affects the performance of m. persicae. to this purpose, we performed no-choice aphid assays and compared m. persicae population development on brl <dig> knockout mutants brl3- <dig> and brl3- <dig>  <cit>  with that on wild type columbia- <dig> . the numbers of m. persicae on these mutants  did not differ from that on col- <dig> . because sks <dig> and sks <dig> are not expressed in control leaves of ws plants , we performed a qpcr experiment to reveal whether these genes are induced upon infestation by m. persicae. induced expression of lipoxygenase  <dig>  indicated an efficient infestation of m. persicae  <cit> , but the expression of sks <dig> and sks <dig> remained undetectable in ws leaves six and  <dig> hours after infestation of m. persicae. therefore, we did not evaluate m. persicae performance on sks <dig> or sks <dig> knockout mutants.

due to the orientation regarding the position of the transposon  and strongest overexpression impact , we decided to focus on sks <dig> for the continuation of this study. to confirm that overexpression of sks <dig> enhances resistance to m. persicae, we generated transgenic col- <dig> lines  in which sks <dig> is overexpressed by the camv 35s promoter. compared to col- <dig>  these lines showed significantly higher expression levels of sks <dig>  and lower numbers of m. persicae . similar to mutant  <dig>  plants of these transgenic lines had smaller, rounder rosette leaves than their corresponding wild type , and delayed flowering. the height of the main stem and the numbers of lateral branches of plants from these transgenic lines did not differ from col- <dig> figure  <dig>

to reveal whether aphid feeding behavior was affected by overexpression of sks <dig> we compared electrical penetration graph   <cit>  recordings of m. persicae on mutant  <dig> and ws plants. the epg parameters relevant for our study are summarized in table  <dig>  no differences were observed for epg parameters related to epidermal or xylem tissue. also the total time of the pathway phase was similar on ws and mutant  <dig> . myzus persicae showed a significantly longer duration of the non-probing phase on mutant  <dig> than on ws . significant differences were also observed for pre-phloem and phloem phase-related activities. compared to ws, m. persicae on mutant  <dig> needed double the amount of time to the first phloem phase, but spend only about one third of the total time in this phase . additionally, fewer m. persicae showed sustained phloem sap ingestion on mutant  <dig> than on ws and the ones that did show this activity on mutant  <dig> did this a smaller number of times . furthermore, aphids on ws spent significantly more time salivating into the phloem and ingesting phloem sap than aphids on mutant  <dig> .table  <dig>

accumulation of reactive oxygen species in mutant line 3790
sks <dig> has a putative function in oxidation/reduction reactions  <cit>  and its co-expressed genes function in the generation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that overexpression of sks <dig> may lead to an accumulation of ros in leaves. to visualize ros we used 3-3’-diaminobenzidine  staining on the leaves of ws, mutant  <dig>  col- <dig> and transgenic line g <dig> . each leaf was injured by forceps to serve as a positive control for the dab staining  <cit> . in comparison to ws and col- <dig> leaves, darker browning was observed in leaves of mutant  <dig> and transgenic line g <dig>  respectively .figure  <dig>

it has been suggested that ros accumulation plays a general role in plant defense against aphids  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that sks <dig> overexpressing plants would not only affect the generalist m. persicae but also other aphid species. this hypothesis was tested by infesting mutant  <dig> and ws with the specialist b. brassicae. at  <dig> days after infestation, an average of four b. brassicae was found on mutant  <dig> and  <dig> b. brassicae on ws plants .

effect of sks <dig> overexpression on transcription of known ja-, sa- and et-defense genes
to determine whether overexpression of sks <dig> affects the plant hormone pathways known to be involved in plant defense against herbivorous insects, we monitored the expression levels of ja-, sa- and et-marker genes in mutant  <dig>  ws, sks <dig> overexpressing transgenic lines and col- <dig> without aphid infestation. in leaves of mutant  <dig> the expression levels of the ja-marker genes lox <dig> , vsp <dig>  and pdf <dig>   as well as sa-marker genes pad <dig>  and pr <dig>  were similar as in leaves of ws . however, the expression level of the et-marker gene erf <dig>  was significantly higher in mutant  <dig> than in ws . conversely to mutant  <dig> , the sks <dig> overexpressing transgenic lines showed significant higher expression levels of the ja-marker genes compared to their corresponding wild type col- <dig> . the sa- and et-marker genes were not affected in these lines .figure  <dig>

discussion
overexpression of sks <dig> in leaves enhances resistance to m. persicae in a. thaliana
mutant  <dig> was previously identified as an a. thaliana mutant on which the population development of m. persicae was reduced  <cit>  and in the present paper we show that this is, at least partly, due to the constitutive overexpression of sks <dig>  the negative effect of sks <dig> on aphid population development was confirmed in transgenic plants that embraced the sks <dig> under the control of camv 35s promoter. an analysis of expression profiles in publicly available microarray data sets revealed that sks <dig> is exclusively expressed in pollen   <cit> . this is in agreement with our observation that sks <dig> was not expressed in leaves of ws or col- <dig>  we also demonstrated that the expression of sks <dig> was not induced upon infestation of m. persicae. this is consistent with previous microarray studies in which no induction of sks <dig> expression in a. thaliana after m. persicae infestation was found .

overexpression of sks <dig> affects feeding behavior of m. persicae probably due to ros accumulation
analysis of m. persicae feeding behavior by the epg technique can provide insight into the plant resistance mechanisms  <cit> . the epg results suggest that plant resistance conferred by overexpression of sks <dig> was phloem based. this was supported by the fact that the phloem phase of m. persicae on sks <dig> overexpressing plants was delayed in time and reduced in length, while the length of the pathway phase was not significantly different from the control. the phloem based resistance was further indicated by the reduced number of sustained phloem sap ingestions. as sustained phloem sap ingestion is required for the transmission of persistently transmitted viruses  <cit> , the phloem based resistance explains the decreased transmission of such a virus, i.e. turnip yellows virus, as previously observed in mutant  <dig>  <cit> .

to uncover the role of sks <dig> in the phloem based plant resistance to m. persicae, we explored the possible biological function of this gene. as structurally related to multiple-copper oxidases, ascorbate oxidases and laccases, sks <dig> has been suggested to function in oxidation/reduction reactions  <cit> . furthermore, sks <dig> is co-expressed with genes involved in ros generation   <cit> . therefore we hypothesized that constitutive overexpression of sks <dig> results in an accumulation of ros in leaves and confirmed this by dab staining the leaves of sks <dig> overexpressing plants. the effect of ros accumulation on aphid feeding behavior has also been shown for a triticale cultivar with a high concentration of ros on which cereal aphids displayed a reduced time in the phloem phase and a prolonged time in the non-probe phase  <cit> . this is similar to our observations of m. persicae feeding behavior on sks <dig> overexpressing plants. the accumulation of ros was suggested to play a role in plant resistance to several aphid species  <cit> . this is also in line with our results, as aphid resistance on sks <dig> overexpressing plants not only affected m. persicae but also b. brassicae performance. besides enhancing aphid resistance, excessive ros can damage proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and can eventual be harmful to plant growth  <cit> , thereby explaining the reduced size of sks <dig> overexpressing plants.

overexpression of sks <dig> affects plant hormone pathways in a. thaliana
several studies suggest that ros accumulation is linked with the ja, sa and et plant hormone pathways to play a role in plant defense against aphids  <cit> . for instance, the a. thaliana rbohd mutant, in which ja-induced ros accumulation does not occur, promotes a four times larger aphid population development than its wild type col- <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that aphid resistance conferred by activation of the ja pathway is probably mediated by ros accumulation. in our study, we observed a similar activation of the ja pathway in sks <dig> overexpressing col- <dig> plants, as indicated by the significantly higher expression levels of three ja marker genes.

in mutant  <dig>  sks <dig> is overexpressed in a. thaliana accession ws and the et pathway is activated instead of the ja pathway, which may be due to the genetic differences between col- <dig> and ws in response to ros accumulation  <cit> . furthermore, ros may indirectly affect plant growth through altered signaling pathways. kerchev et al.  <cit>  concluded that a reduced arabidopsis plant growth results from a low ascorbate, a compound that buffers the production of ros, that triggers aba- and ja dependent signaling. as ascorbate buffers the production of ros, low levels of this compound would result in enhanced ros accumulation. this is consistent with the observed higher ros accumulation and reduced plant growth for both mutant  <dig> and sks <dig> overexpressing transgenic lines in our study. our observation that signaling pathways were differently affected suggests that other factors may influence plant growth as well. in addition to sks <dig>  the higher expression of brl <dig> and/or sks <dig> may contribute to this difference. alternatively the additional differences may be attributed to unknown interactions among br, et and ros. studying the interaction between sks <dig> and ja-/et-mediated defense responses may lead to a better understanding of activation of ja and et responses and their contribution to aphid resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
overexpression of sks <dig> in a. thaliana leads to a reduced phloem feeding of m. persicae, which probably is due to accumulation of ros in leaves. the reduced phloem feeding results in the suppression of the population development of m. persicae and also decreases the transmission of persistent viruses. overexpression of sks <dig> in a. thaliana also affects b. brassicae and possibly other phloem feeding insects as well. the enhanced resistance towards m. persicae and b. brassicae in sks <dig> overexpressing a. thaliana plants reduces plant development.
