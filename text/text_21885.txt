BACKGROUND
the manipulation of recombinant dna molecules is an indispensable step in modern high-throughput protein crystallization studies  <cit> . restriction enzyme/ligase cloning, which relies on restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, is a simple and easy way to move a fragment of double-stranded dna from one plasmid to another  <cit> . however, this technique has two limitations  <cit> : it is ineffective when lack of unique restriction sites and sometimes results in introduction of unwanted extra sequences. to circumvent these limitations, various restriction endonuclease cleavage site–independent cloning methods have recently been developed . these methods have made cloning more accessible in cases in which conventional restriction site cloning was difficult or impossible. while as alternative cloning strategies are still required for more choices.

the restriction-free  cloning strategy, as described extensively in the literature, was developed as a powerful tool for reconstituting genes in circular vectors  <cit> . because rf cloning requires no alterations in the plasmid or the gene of interest, it is exceptionally well-suited for high-throughput cloning. the gene of interest is amplified in a regular polymerase chain reaction , which produces a primer pair that, once annealed to the vector of interest, is extended in a linear amplification reaction. thus, this method relies on amplified genes functioning as primers. however, this approach also has limitations. first, the motion of large dna fragments and the formation of secondary structures will affect the efficiency of pcr. second, this method relies on digestion with dpni, which cleaves methylated dna, to remove parental plasmids. the efficiency of dpni treatment is influenced by many factors, and requires vector propagation in dam+ strains  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe a simple and fast method for performing gene reconstitution by modified restriction-free  cloning. in this method, two rounds of pcr generate two dna fragments with compatible 5' or 3’ cohesive ends, which are therefore able to ligate to each other. this new method is independent of the existence of restrictions sites and dpni treatment. using this method, we made  <dig> constructs with inserts of variable size, with average cloning efficiency higher than 85%. the efficiency was not significantly affected by the insert length up to 20 kb.

RESULTS
method overview and primer design
figure  <dig> shows the scheme for mrf cloning. we define the 5–8 bp dna fragments before the insert site a as “5’ overhang” and those after insert site b as “3’ overhang” . to replace a gene  in a vector between sites a and b, we designed eight primers : primer  <dig>  forward primer, which contains a ~25 bp sequence homologous to the positive strand of the gene; primer  <dig>  reverse primer, which contains a ~25 bp sequence homologous to the negative strand of the gene; primer  <dig>  forward primer, which is the same as primer  <dig> but has an additional 5’ overhang at the 5’ end; primer  <dig>  reverse primer, which is the same as primer  <dig> but has an additional 3’ overhang at the 5’ end; primer  <dig>  forward primer, which contains a ~25 bp sequence homologous to the negative strand of the vector; primer  <dig>  reverse primer, which contains a ~25 bp sequence homologous to the positive strand of the vector; primer  <dig>  reverse primer, which is the same as primer  <dig> but has an additional 5' overhang at the 5’ end; primer  <dig>  reverse primer, which is the same as primer  <dig> but has an additional 3’ overhang at the 5’ end. all primers were designed with g or c as the 5’ and 3’ terminal nucleotide.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of mrf cloning. the insert gene or vector was amplified by regular double-primer pcr using genomic dna, cdna, or the original vector as template. compatible cohesive ends of insert gene or vector were created by two single-primer linear pcrs performed in parallel, followed by annealing of the two pcr products. inserts and acceptors with compatible cohesive ends were then assembled by ligation




we used two pairs of primers, primer 1/primer  <dig> and primer 5/primer  <dig>  to generate two dna fragments, using the target gene and vector as templates, respectively. the resultant pcr products were gel purified. we then amplified these two dna fragments in two separate pcr reactions containing either forward or reverse primer, which will add 5’ overhang or 3’ overhang to the pcr products . finally, dna fragments with complementary overhang at the 5’ or 3’ end were able to anneal to each other, and were joined by dna ligase . the ligated products were then transformed into dh5α competent cells. the inserted genes were verified by colony pcr and further confirmed by dna sequencing.

mrf cloning can assemble insert dna fragment into target vector
we first tested this protocol to reconstitute the e. coli rada gene into pet22b. based on the initial success of the protocol, we continued to employ it to generate the constructs needed for our studies. for example, we planned to replace the rada gene in vector pet22b between the start codon atg  and the sequence caccaccaccaccaccac   to yield a new construct with the gene under the control of a t <dig> promoter and a c-terminal his6-tag to facilitate protein purification. as shown in fig.  <dig>  to replace the rada gene in the vector, two parallel pcrs were performed to amplify each dna fragment using the primer pairs pet22b1/pet22b <dig> and rada1/rada <dig>  as shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  using pet22b or e. coli genomic dna as templates to generate dna fragments “1” and “2”. amplified products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by gel extraction. we then performed two separate single-primer linear pcrs:  using pet22b <dig> or pet22b <dig> alone, with dna fragment “1” as the template, to obtain single-strand dna fragment “3-1” or “3-2”; and  using rada <dig> or rada <dig> alone, with dna fragment “2” as template, to obtain single-strand dna fragment “4-1” or “4-2”. fragments “3-1” and “3-2” and “4-1” and “4-2” were then annealed to obtain double-strand dna fragments “3” and “4”, which have sticky ends that can ligate with other compatible ends. for single-primer pcr, we used ~500 ng of template, about  <dig> times more than the standard amount recommended for double-primer pcr , as dna amplification in single-primer pcr is linear . as the efficiency of cohesive ligation is higher than that of blunt-end ligation, the parental dna of the products of second-round pcr did not need to be removed. after pcr purification, these second-round pcr products were ready for ligation. in each transformation, we routinely checked eight colonies at random from each transformation by colony pcr with a forward primer annealing to vector and a reverse primer annealing to the inserted gene.table  <dig> pcr reaction components

application of mrf cloning in genes reconstitution
in routine application of our cloning method, we created  <dig> constructs from e. coli genomic dna and human cdna  with inserts of variable size . e. coli genes and gene clusters  were cloned from the e. coli genome. the e. coli genes and gene clusters were subcloned into pet22b, with the gene under the control of a t <dig> promoter, and with a c-terminal his6-tag to facilitate protein purification . human genes were subcloned into the expression vector pcdna™  <dig>    . under our test conditions, we achieved an average cloning efficiency of  <dig> %. dna sequencing revealed that all genes were correctly placed in the plasmid.

discussion
in this study, we describe a new cloning method. the technique uses two rounds of pcr to obtain inserts and acceptors with compatible cohesive ends, which are then ligated. using this method, we made  <dig> constructs with inserts of variable size. the average cloning efficiency was  <dig> %, as determined by colony pcr and sequencing of the cloned genes. because the method relies on pcr to generate cohesive 5’ or 3’ ends for dna ligation, restriction sites are not needed, which facilitates cloning of the gene of interest. for convenience, we only used the vector pet22b for e. coli genes and pcdna™  <dig>   for human genes, but used inserts of variable size. our results showed that cloning efficiency was not significantly affected by the different inserts, thus providing a glimpse of the wide choice in inserts that can be used as a template, which then can be used as an alternative method for multiple fragment assembly and library construction.

we noticed that cloning efficiency was not altered dramatically by fragment length. as shown in table  <dig> and additional file 7: figure s <dig>  this method was suitable for the cloning of large dna sequences up to 20 kb in size. in contrast to traditional restriction enzyme cloning, the method described here provides a much more flexible approach to gene cloning. therefore, it represents a cost-effective and simple solution for high-throughput cloning applications. because this method relies on pcr amplification of the dna sequences, the most crucial requirement is high-fidelity dna polymerase. fortunately, the high-fidelity polymerases recently developed for cloning, e.g., phusion® high-fidelity dna polymerase and kod hot start dna polymerase, have extremely low error rates. therefore, it is no longer challenging to amplify large dna fragments for use in our method.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a novel cloning method that provides an alternative approach to dna assembly. this method is independent of restriction sites and dpni treatment, and does not introduce undesired operational sequences at the junctions of functional modules. this new method simplifies complex cloning procedures in which long stretches of dna can be inserted into circular plasmids in an unrestricted way, and the efficiency does not decrease for long inserts up to 20 kb. the simplicity of both primer design and the procedure itself makes the method suitable for high-throughput studies. the protein of interest is expressed without the addition of extra residues originating from the cloning procedure, making it an attractive alternative method for structural genomics.
