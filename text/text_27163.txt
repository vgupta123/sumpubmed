BACKGROUND
algae-based biofuels have been gaining attention as a potential production platform for renewable fuel and biochemicals. algal systems offer advantages over terrestrial plant sources, such as higher productivity, increased oils, avoidance of food-for-fuel, and the potential for using both wastewater and saltwater  <cit> . however, an improved understanding of nutrient utilization in algal cultures is needed to develop the high density culturing methods that are required to achieve economic feasibility of these systems. increasing reactor productivity through application of high-density cell concentration reduces downstream harvesting costs. the work in this article aims to achieve this goal by maintaining culture ph through the use of stoichiometrically- balanced growth media.

high density algal culture requires the development of media which provides high inorganic salt concentrations while avoiding the accumulation of inhibitory levels of counter-ions  <cit> . metabolic flux analysis has been used in an effort to characterize relative rates of consumption in cellular processes, but is only as effective as our limited understanding of algal metabolism  <cit> . another approach to formulate growth media is through an examination of the biomass composition  <cit> . this method is effective for optimization of key inorganic components, but does not address the coupling of nitrogen utilization with the energy balance as reflected in the oxygen and hydrogen components of the biomass. a better understanding of the overall stoichiometry and energetics of growth including water splitting to provide reducing power is required to achieve the goal of ultra-high density algal cultivation.

photosynthetic growth presents a major challenge to stoichiometry that is rarely appreciated – even by those who have studied it for space life support systems! the presumed photosynthesis growth equation allows for the direct calculation of the stoichiometric coefficients in terms of biomass composition  once a nitrogen source ni is specified . table  <dig> is a compilation of the stoichiometric coefficients on potential nitrogen sources for photoautotrophic growth under the base condition of no extracellular metabolite excretion .

the stoichiometric coefficients were determined algebraically from equation  <dig> and are given in terms of biomass composition  for various nitrogen sources when extracellular metabolites are not considered.

this array of stoichiometric solutions for photoautotrophic growth emphasizes the need for an additional consideration in the overall energy balance. unlike heterotrophic or autotrophic growth where the energy production reaction  can be decoupled from biomass formation, the same cannot be done for photoautotrophic growth. decoupling of energy and biomass production to balance stoichiometry is achieved by specifying a heterotrophic biomass yield on a particular substrate for a given organism. while additional energy is available for photosynthetic growth through the splitting of water and reduction of electron carriers i such as ferredoxin or nadp+ as shown in equation  <dig>  there is no outlet for these “waste” hydrogen atoms in the basic photosynthetic growth equations.

  2h2o→hvo2+4h+i 

according to growth as constrained by equation  <dig>  these “waste” hydrogen atoms would have to be absorbed into the biomass, requiring changes in biomass composition. however, the composition of biomass is rather constant across organisms, which illustrates the need for modification of the basic growth equation to account for this proton imbalance or to decouple the energy balance from growth as shown in equation  <dig> 

  αico2+ψini+δih2o→hυchxnyoz+λio2+ϕih+ 

the nature of ϕi for different nitrogen sources and its relation to energetics will be the focus of subsequent study. in this paper our objective is to design media to facilitate ph control  using a combination of nitrogen sources with different degrees of reduction. the issue of ph control is implicitly appreciated in typical culture methods for algae. ammonium is rarely used for growth because of its associated ‘toxicity’

 ϕnh4+> <dig>  <cit> . growth on nitrate is linked to a rise in ph ϕno3−< <dig> anetuptakeofprotons and is routinely used in combination with elevated co <dig> to suppress ph changes through buffering associated with bicarbonate equilibrium. high gas-phase co <dig> supplementation is comparable to the direct use of bicarbonate salts as buffers. in addition to ph buffering, the bicarbonate equilibrium system affects co <dig> transport and the kinetics of growth. elevated ph provides a greater driving force for co <dig> transport due to the shift in carbon dissolution in water as shown in equation  <dig>  however, a neutral or acidic ph is more favorable for carbon fixing microalgae at the cellular level because bicarbonate and dissolved co <dig> are preferred over carbonate  <cit> .

  co2g↔co2aq+h2o↔h2co3↔h++hco3−↔h++co32− 

while elevated co <dig> provides for buffering of ph, this excess co <dig> presents severe limitations to achieving high yield of co <dig> use in a photosynthetic system. the unused co <dig> that is not taken up by cells is ultimately released into the atmosphere. providing elevated co <dig> is expensive, unsafe, not sustainable, and difficult to implement in large-scale algal culture systems. to improve both the economic feasibility of commercial scale systems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is desirable to maximize co <dig> yield, which will require reducing the gaseous co <dig> supplementation level. therefore, typical ph control achieved through nitrate metabolism and elevated co <dig> is not feasible. buffers and acid/base addition are alternative ph control methods for bench-scale reactors, but result in accumulation of counter ions which can contribute to ‘culture crash’ when operating continuously at ultra-high density . as a result, we have developed a new ph control strategy based on the stoichiometry of growth to allow for maintaining ph at the commercial-scale.

defining a balanced nh4+/no3- media
a medium containing both ammonium and nitrate provides the opportunity to balance external ph  for prolonged growth. this approach has been empirically developed in plant tissue culture, where growth to high densities is achievable as plant cells selectively consume ammonium and nitrate to balance their external ph  <cit> . in keeping with the long-term goal of media that supports ultra-high density algal cultivation, the ability to provide a significant amount of nitrogen as nh4no <dig> has the added advantage of avoiding inhibitory accumulation of counter-ions. the stoichiometric growth equation for co-provision of ammonium and nitrate is written as shown in equation  <dig>  where Δ is the fraction of nitrogen present in the form of ammonium given as Δ = /. since the ammonium degree of reduction is large, Δ is expected to be less than  <dig> .

while an exhaustive review of literature revealed extensive discussion of inconsistences and problems attempting to resolve photosynthetic efficiency  <cit> , there are no reports where the mass balance provided by equation  <dig> has accurately accounted for the proton imbalance. instead, the most detailed studies of algal growth mass balance have utilized urea  <cit> , which has empirically been observed to achieve a balanced ph during continuous growth . the balance in the degree of reduction achieved for photosynthetic growth on urea represents an energetic constraint we wish to reproduce in a new algal growth medium through the selection of an appropriate ammonium fraction. this rationale was the basis for equating the amount of carbon dioxide that is fixed relative to the amount of water that is split  for these two media alternatives. by setting αδurea equal to αδnh4+:no3−, Δ can be expressed in terms of the biomass composition as given in equation  <dig>  details of the algebraic stoichiometric analysis are provided in additional file  <dig> 

  Δ=4−x42−y 

excluding storage compounds such as lipids and carbohydrates, the composition of biomass is nearly constant across organisms. the stoichiometry of biomass growth has often relied on the detailed compositional analysis of e. coli, ch <dig>  n <dig> o <dig>  <cit> , which corresponds to  <dig> % nitrogen by mass . this biomass composition gives a 30% ammonium composition  in our mixed nitrogen source media design . the biomass composition of chlorella has been reported as ch <dig>  n <dig> o <dig>   and for chlamydomonas as ch <dig>  n <dig> o <dig>    <cit> , which both give Δ = 29%. this value of ammonium-nitrogen is consistent with the composition of ms media  <cit>  for plant tissue culture , which have been arrived at empirically for heterotrophic growth without ph control ϕms ≈  <dig> 

keeping in mind that the goal to produce biofuels involves the accumulation of a product  that has a very high carbon to oxygen ratio. this product can be included in the stoichiometric growth equation as shown in equation  <dig>  where β is an experimentally determined yield for the product such as%lipid β1+β×100% after conversion from a mass to molar basis.

  αco2+Δpψnh4++1−Δpψno3−+δh2o→hυchxnyoz+βchpnqor+λo2+ϕph+ 

for a fuel molecule, the carbon to oxygen ratio will be high such that r « z and nitrogen will not be present . since the degree of reduction of a fuel product is greater than that of the biomass, there will be an increased demand for a reduced nitrogen source  with the added energetic advantage of feeding more ammonium relative to nitrate  <cit> . therefore, the nitrogen ratio that will achieve a proton balance will be dependent upon the level and composition of products formed. an ammonium level of 36% of the total nitrogen  was chosen as the base media composition for ph-balanced algal growth. in the results below, the observation of differential nitrogen uptake will be shown to dramatically affect the dynamics of ph. therefore, further refinement of the proton balance involves controlling the dynamics of nitrogen availability in addition to the stoichiometric composition. the work that follows demonstrates how fed-batch addition of our stoichiometric media can be used to overcome the ph instability that results from the inability of microalgal cultures to selectively consume either ammonium or nitrate.

RESULTS
proton imbalance in microalgal cultures is caused by preferential ammonium uptake
chlorella vulgaris cultures were grown in  <dig> -l loop air-lift photobioreactors  under 5% co <dig>  in air with  <dig>  gn/l provided as 0-36% from ammonium  and the balance as nitrate. the highest ammonium concentration corresponded to our growth medium designed to be stoichiometrically-balanced for un-buffered ph control . cultures provided with  <dig> and  <dig> % nitrogen from ammonium displayed significant growth as shown in figure 1a, whereas higher levels of ammonium caused growth to stop in early log phase. as anticipated, the culture grown on nitrate-only demonstrated a steady rise in ph over the growth period as a net influx of protons was required to support metabolism . in contrast, cultures grown on the ammonium levels of 9% or more fell below a ph of  <dig> and stopped growing. even the lowest level of ammonium addition at  <dig> %n-nh4+ resulted in a dramatic decrease to ph =  <dig> during the growth phase followed by subsequent ph rise indicating sequential ammonium and nitrate metabolism. these observations strongly suggest the inability of chlorella vulgaris to utilize nitrate to balance ph and sustain growth when ammonium was present.

to further substantiate that the observed ph swing in the surviving culture was due to ammonium metabolism followed by nitrate, a second batch experiment was executed to compare the ph drop in chlorella vulgaris cultures given ammonium with either nitrate or chloride as the counter-ion . continuous ph monitoring was implemented within the  <dig> -l loop air-lift photobioreactors supplemented with 5% co <dig>  in air. both reactors contained the same initial level of ammonium,  <dig>  gn-nh4+/l  and experienced nearly identical ph drop during the initial growth phase. the culture grown on nh4cl ceased growth whereas the ammonium nitrate culture displayed a subsequent recovery of ph and continued growth. this observation is consistent with nearly exclusive utilization of ammonium over nitrate and corroborates previous reports that nitrate utilization is inhibited in the presence of ammonium  <cit> . it is notable that chlorella was capable of surviving a ph swing to below  <dig> where the bicarbonate equilibrium is shifted almost entirely to aqueous dissolved co <dig>  assuming exclusive consumption of ammonium during the initial drop in ph and not considering buffering, the change in proton concentration during ammonium consumption for both cultures was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mol h+/mol n-nh4+. it is interesting to note that the apparent yields on nitrogen are much lower for ammonium as compared to nitrate:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gdw/gn-nh4+ and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gdw/gn-no3-, respectively. the value of nitrogen yield for generic biomass  is  <dig>  gdw/gn; the observed lower biomass yield on ammonium would be consistent with accumulation within the cell in excess of the minimum requirement for biomass formation.

similar batch experiments were executed with chlamydomonas reinhardtii to determine how this ‘model’ microalga responded to mixed nitrogen sources. photoautotrophic cultures were grown in  <dig> -l loop airlift photobioreactors under 5% co <dig>  in air on media with  <dig>  gn/l with ammonium provided as 0-9% of the nitrogen  and the balance as nitrate. all cultures continued to grow during the  <dig> photo-hour growth period as shown in figure 3a. the minimum ph observed in the chlamydomonas cultures was proportional to the initial ammonium level provided. chlamydomonas reinhardtii grew despite reaching a ph as low as  <dig> , whereas chlorella vulgaris did not sustain growth below a ph of  <dig> . as further evidence for the preferential uptake of nitrate in the presence of ammonium, the nitrate concentration measured by an ion-selective probe was initially constant until the minimum ph was reached . this provides more conclusive evidence that alga cells did not take up nitrate in the presence of ammonium. the observed biomass yields on nitrogen for chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures during the respective nitrogen assimilation phases were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gdw/gn-nh4+ and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gdw/gn-no3- respectively. the lower biomass yields on nitrogen for chlamydomonas are consistent with a reduced accumulation of fatty acid lipids as compared to chlorella. the low biomass yield of chlamydomonas indicates an accumulation of nitrogen within the cells to over  <dig> % by mass, compared to  <dig> % for generic biomass.

towards achieving ph control using nitrogen feeding, proton secretion in conjunction with ammonium metabolism can be calculated from the observed ph drop and growth data. the change in proton concentration during ammonium uptake increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mol h+/mol n-nh4+ as the nitrogen provided from ammonium increased from 6% to 9% when buffering is neglected . this large change in apparent ϕ/ψ  is influenced by the buffering capacity of the media including the bicarbonate equilibrium . the buffering of the algal cultures is shown to change dramatically throughout a batch culture as illustrated in additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

this substantial change in the buffering capacity of the media during growth precludes accurate assessments of proton secretion  from ph measurements and will be deferred to future studies with instrumentation designed for monitoring the proton balance more accurately. nonetheless, it is clear that the proton imbalance must be considered in the overall mass balance. the role of carbonate buffering at higher ph is also evident as the same final ph was achieved in all cultures. more co <dig> can absorb into the culture at higher ph as a result of the co2↔hco3-↔co32- ‘carbonate’ equilibrium. this represents an additional bioreactor design constraint because the bicarbonate buffering not only masks changes in the proton concentration due to nitrogen metabolism, but also alters ph as a function of bioreactor co <dig> transport rates and biological uptake rates. it is important to note that proton efflux in stoichiometric terms is very different from the simplistic local charge balance of 1: <dig> molar exchange for a transporter. proton exchange per mole of nitrogen assimilated  reflects the incorporation of hydrogen into biomass and allows for net charge balance by alternative cations. understanding the combined role of nitrogen stoichiometry and co <dig> dynamics is an important step towards implementing media-based control of ph that is needed for a large-scale algal process that does not rely on buffering and is a prerequisite to accurately closing the mass balance on algal biomass growth.

differential cellular regulation of nitrogen metabolism facilitates novel approach to ph control in microalgae
the ph instability observed in microalgal culture from preferential utilization of ammonium can be explained by cellular regulation of nitrogen assimilation. ammonium has the ability to inhibit both nitrate transport and reduction as demonstrated in the bio-molecular model in figure  <dig> generated from a literature review on nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . upon depletion of ammonium, repression of the nitrate assimilatory pathway is alleviated and nitrate transport into the cell can occur, followed by a 2-step reduction to ammonium. the carbon concentration mechanism  allows accumulation of co <dig> for rubisco and includes regulatory genes that are involved in functionality of both nitrogen assimilation pathways. elevated co <dig> gas-phase supplementation results in sufficient internal carbon for biomass formation and the ccm does not interfere with nitrogen metabolism.

the ph response to ammonium and nitrate utilization suggests that ph might be maintained if the addition of nitrogen salts exploited the intracellular regulatory mechanisms on nitrogen metabolism. this approach would require that cells be able to rapidly change from nitrate to ammonium assimilation and is surprisingly simple considering the complexity of nitrogen assimilation. the dramatically simplified control elements that give rise to the observed ph changes and facilitate ph control through alternating utilization of ammonium and nitrate are presented in figure  <dig>  when ammonium is present, nitrate assimilation is inhibited  and excess hydrogen is excreted from the cells as not all hydrogen from ammonium is required for biomass formation. upon depletion of ammonium, nitrate assimilation can occur , which requires a net influx of hydrogen into the cell for reduction. the success of the control strategy relies on manipulating the direction of proton flux by alternating nitrogen sources to minimize the net effect on culture ph. in simple terms, algae are behaving as if they have uncontrolled consumption of ammonium which can be manipulated through fed-batch addition.

to test this behavior, a photoautotrophic culture of chlamydomonas reinhardtii actively growing on nitrate was subjected to a pulse ammonium feed and displayed rapid ph drop . this suggested that there is sufficient expression of ammonium transporters during nitrate utilization so that the incremental addition of ammonium can be used for periodic reduction of ph  <cit> . this approach will thereby provide a means to implement the proposed stoichiometrically-balanced nitrogen feed .

incremental addition of stoichiometrically-balanced media provides favorable ph for sustained growth of chlorella vulgaris
fed-batch ammonium and nitrate addition was successfully implemented for growth of chlorella vulgaris in an ultra-low path length trickle film photobioreactor . this reactor configuration was used to avoid the effect of light attenuation due to self-shading by minimizing film thickness and maximizing light penetration into the culture  <cit> . it is also important to note that the design of the enclosed trickle-film bioreactor with humidified gas and heat removal by a heat exchanger were implemented to eliminate evaporation so that observed increases in cell concentration would reflect growth and not evaporative concentration of the biomass. potassium nitrate was provided at the beginning of the culture followed by ammonium nitrate additions after 6 hours of initial growth to ensure non-limiting nitrogen levels in the media. the first addition provided  <dig>  mgn-nh4+/l and corresponded to  <dig> % of the total  <dig>  gn/l supplied over the reactor run. subsequent nh4no <dig> additions were increased to  <dig>  mgn-nh4+/l without dropping the ph to inhibitory levels.

during the lighted hours, the ph was maintained between  <dig>  and  <dig>  as shown in figure 6a. within this ph range, bicarbonate is the dominant dissolved inorganic carbon species, which is believed to be the preferred carbon source for photosynthesis in chlorella vulgaris <cit> . after the first four ammonium nitrate additions, a ph drop was followed by a ph rise as ammonium was preferentially consumed followed by nitrate assimilation. it is interesting to note that the ph response following the last feeding  did not display the characteristic recovery of ph as nitrate levels reached  <dig>  gno3-/l , which would still be within the range of the low affinity transport system that operates above  <dig>  mm n  <cit> . this unexpected response to ammonium addition suggests that other cellular regulation might be encountered that affect the ph control strategy.

the rapid rise in ph that occurs during the dark culture hours resulted because the supplemental co <dig> was turned off ‘at night’ and the inorganic carbon species shift back to equilibrium with ambient co <dig> . note that the mean gas residence time within the enclosed trickle film reactor bag enclosure was estimated at 6-min so that it takes about half an hour to change the gas composition. this dark period increase in ph illustrates the significant effect of co <dig> transport and the resulting bicarbonate buffering system on the culture ph that result from 5% co <dig> gas-phase supplementation. a long-term goal of our research program is to achieve high-density growth without co <dig> buffering, which will require an understanding of the relationship between nitrogen regulation, carbon availability, and ph dynamics.

the accumulation of algal biomass during the 32-hr photobioreactor run with fed-batch nitrogen addition is shown in figure 6b. this trickle film bioreactor run reached  <dig> gdw/l, which was a substantially higher density than observed in prior batch experiments with comparable feeding . a possible explanation for the improved biomass yield is that maintenance of a more uniform ph during growth allowed the cells to more effectively utilize the energy available in the reduced nitrogen source. during the 24 hours of lighting, the culture grew at a specific growth rate of  <dig> /hr . the observed exponential growth suggests that the culture had not become limited by light, co <dig> transport or inorganic nutrients during this period. the change in proton secretion during ammonium uptake  after an ammonium nitrate pulse was smaller at higher cell densities , which is consistent with the previously observed increase in buffering capacity at higher culture density .

ph control based on nitrogen feed can be implemented during nitrogen-limited growth of chlamydomonas reinhardtii
since nitrogen limitation is viewed as an important strategy to induce lipid accumulation in algae  <cit> , an experiment was carried out with chlamydomonas under a n-limited feed rate. the culture was grown in a trickle film photobioreactor to avoid light-limited growth and 5% co <dig>  in air to provide excess carbon. the culture was initially grown on potassium nitrate with ammonium nitrate additions started after 10 hours of growth. the total base nitrogen level was doubled to  <dig>  gn/l while retaining the balanced 36% nitrogen from ammonium and the balance as nitrate. a nutrient feeding strategy was used to initially maintain excess nitrogen, followed by growth where nitrogen became depleted between additions. the ph response to nh4no <dig> addition was the same before and after depletion of excess nitrate, displaying the characteristic decline during nh4+ assimilation and recovery during subsequent no3- uptake. during the 16-hour lighted photoperiod of days 1– <dig>  the photobioreactor ph was maintained between  <dig>  and  <dig>  as shown in figure 7a. nightly ph swings were observed due to the removal of supplemental co <dig> at night. during nitrogen limitation, linear growth was observed at a rate of  <dig>  gdw/l/hr as shown in figure 7b. the biomass yield during nitrogen-limited growth was determined to be  <dig>  gdw/gn corresponding to the nominal biomass composition of 10% nitrogen by weight.

under nitrogen-depleted conditions, the ph dropped, recovered and became constant as shown in more detail in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  this suggests a nearly balanced proton secretion and uptake  during the respective phases of ammonium and nitrate assimilation as illustrated by the figure 7b inset. the observed change in ph with nearly identical magnitude but with opposite signs as ammonium and nitrate are consumed following nh4no <dig> addition is consistent with charge balance of proton flux during nitrogen ion uptake. this simplistic view of ph change could greatly simplify ph control and might in part result from small rapid nutrient additions as well as buffering. however, it must be remembered that the co <dig> and cell density-dependent buffering are significantly contributing to this ph response and will require more detailed study where buffering is minimized. nonetheless, these short-term ph responses must be superimposed on the longer time-scale mass balance where the final redox state of nitrogen within the cell as well as the overall cation/anion uptake must be satisfied. our near-term goals are to incorporate these models into an adaptive control strategy that will incorporate more comprehensive modeling of growth and ph dynamics, as it is dependent on the variable growth conditions that algae will experience in outdoor environmental conditions. towards achieving this goal, a final experiment is presented for growth conditions under ambient  co <dig> growth conditions.

carbon limitations reveal additional regulatory mechanisms on nitrogen metabolism in chlamydomonas that lead to unpredictable ph dynamics
to reveal cellular level metabolic controls on nitrogen assimilation in the absence of excess co <dig>  chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures were grown on air. this allowed testing of ph control using ammonium feed under conditions with minimal carbonate buffering. in addition, algal growth performance under reduced co <dig> availability is particularly important for the goal of achieving a high co <dig> utilization yield in commercial-scale photobioreactors. this study was conducted in gyratory shake flasks where the mass transfer rate  could be accurately measured to verify the onset of carbon limitation as the cause for linear growth. the transition to carbon limitation was imposed by providing a co <dig> transport rate from air, which eventually became lower than the biological uptake rate of co <dig> during growth on  <dig>  gn/l . prior to carbon limitation, the culture grew at an exponential growth rate of μ =  <dig> /hr . following carbon limitation, growth continued at a linear rate of  <dig>  od550/hr , which compares well with the predicted growth rate of  <dig>  od550/hr  calculated based on  <dig> % c by mass in the biomass and a co <dig> transfer rate of  <dig>  mg co2/hr for klaco2=48/hr <cit> . these growth patterns support the intended experimental conditions of carbon-excess early in culture followed by carbon-limited growth after  <dig> photo-hours.

the ph was maintained between  <dig> and  <dig>  during exponential growth  with the expected ph decline and recovery following each nh4no <dig> media addition that exhibited a more rapid response as the culture density increased . the same regulatory mechanisms for nitrogen metabolism previously presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> are apparent in air-grown cultures as long as the carbon concentrating mechanism can maintain excess intracellular carbon. the inset of figure 8b shows the decline in apparent ph change for growth on ammonium  as anticipated, justifying the increase in nh4no <dig> dosage at higher densities prior to carbon limitation. following carbon limitation the ph dynamics became unpredictable and the ph ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  when aqueous carbon is limiting, the carbon concentration mechanism  can no longer provide sufficient co <dig> to rubisco to support its maximum turnover rate. feedback regulation from ccm to the nitrogen assimilation pathways acts to avoid intercellular accumulation of exogenously supplied or nitrate-derived ammonium and coordinate with 2-oxogluatarate availability for glutamate formation  <cit> . this altered nitrogen assimilation under carbon limitation adds complexity to the ph control strategy because the presence of ammonium is no longer sufficient to completely inhibit nitrate uptake  <cit> . a more detailed assessment of metabolic fluxes will clearly be required beyond simple on/off control that is possible when carbon is in excess. there is a tremendous value in further understanding carbon limited nitrogen assimilation due to its implications in both natural and engineered algal growth systems.

regulation of nitrogen assimilation in algae has important implications to achieving stoichiometrically-balanced media and associated control of culture ph
although the concept of achieving ph control through stoichiometrically-balanced ammonium and nitrate is shown to have validity, this cannot be implemented with a simple batch media formulation. the preferential uptake of ammonium ions over nitrate results in a ph drop proportional to the ammonium provided. our observation of preferential uptake of ammonium for a wide range of algae and cyanobacteria is consistent with the literature  <cit> . the implication of ph-independent preferential ammonium uptake is that algae will literally kill themselves by consuming ammonium ions even if nitrate is available to prevent media acidification. this result is in contrast to higher plants, which have the ability to utilize nitrate and ammonia in a balanced matter so that ph does not reach toxic levels. this is very notably observed in plant cell suspension culture where cultures can be grown to extremely high densities  on a mixture of ammonium and nitrate  <cit> .

physiologically it makes sense that cells within tissue must be capable of controlled metabolism of nitrogen so that the ph is maintained. in contrast, unicellular algae would not typically be grown at sufficiently high concentrations where metabolism would dramatically impact the surrounding water. in addition, ammonium ions are typically far less abundant in an environmental context . as a result, a high-density algal photobioreactor system creates an unnatural environment that microalgae have not evolved to accommodate and the metabolic control that does exist is problematic. the incremental addition of a fed-batch strategy for ph control is only a viable solution if the response to media addition is predictable. current efforts are combining models of co <dig> transport, co <dig> equilibrium, and nitrogen assimilation as the basis of an adaptive control strategy for algal photobioreactors. part of this experimentation seeks to explicitly evaluate the proton balance through measurement of ϕi  and allow for more explicit validation of the stoichiometrically-balanced media formulation approach presented in this research. a particularly important extension of this work is to confirm that ph control can be achieved for cyanobacteria since they are a platform for genetic engineering of biochemicals. cyanobacteria have far more simplistic and less redundant nh4/no <dig> assimilation pathway which may complicate the dynamic response to mixed nitrogen media additions; nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria present an additional challenge that may preclude this ph strategy all-together.

CONCLUSIONS
the scope of this work relates to understanding algal nitrogen metabolism in the context of achieving ph control in high-density algal photobioreactors  <cit> . although a balance of protons during culture growth has received little attention, it has profoundly affected the development of algal media and growth conditions by selection of elevated co <dig> and nitrate or urea, which avoid this problem. in terms of utilizing algal culture at a commercial outdoor scale of thousands of acres, ph control must be achieved for a widely dispersed culture that experiences highly variable day-to-day growth conditions. a balanced media to achieve ph control is a scalable alternative to expensive buffering, feedback acid/base control, or co <dig> enrichment . these observations are particularly important for proposed life cycle analyses that presume the ability to utilize wastewater in which ammonium is a dominant form of nitrogen. the work is also relevant to natural systems that experience agricultural runoff.

several conclusions from the work presented here are a step toward the goal of controlling the ph in culture:

1) an analysis of basic photosynthetic reactions strongly suggests that current algal growth media are not stoichiometrically-balanced.

2) the benefit of elevated co <dig> for algal growth is likely as much for ph control as it is for enhanced co <dig> availability.

3) media which contains ~36% of the total nitrogen in the form of ammonium ions is close to achieving a stoichiometric balance, which would avoid excess proton secretion or uptake.

4) if a stoichiometrically-balanced media is provided in batch culture, the preferential uptake of ammonium ions will result in a drop of ph to inhibitory/lethal levels.

5) incremental addition of ammonium and nitrate ions can be used to control ph as long as the carbon availability is not severely limited and a substantial improvement in biomass yield on nitrogen can be observed.

6) the switch to preferential use of ammonium ions will take place in excess nitrate, or nitrogen-limited culture conditions.

7) achieving ph control through metabolic use of oxidized and reduced nitrogen sources in large scale photobioreactors will require models of co <dig> transport, co <dig> equilibrium and nitrogen assimilation.

these observations of nitrogen assimilation in microalgae appear to be very general and make sense in terms of the physiology and environmental conditions under which these organisms typically grow; therefore, the approach to achieving ph control is anticipated to be true of both monocultures and natural algal consortia. the potential influence of microbial consortia within a non-aseptic algal culture system is an additional consideration that requires further study.
