BACKGROUND
the circadian clock, entrained by our planet’s 24 h rotation on its tilted axis, plays crucial roles in the synchronization of the performance of organisms with daily cycles of light and temperature, enabling organisms to regulate activities at the correct time of a day  <cit> . for instance, the endogenous clock in plants influences various biological processes including leaf movements, hypocotyl growth, floral transition, and abiotic and biotic stress resistance  <cit> .

the circadian rhythmicity and molecular mechanisms underlying the circadian clock have been investigated in many organisms including drosophila melanogaster, neurospora crassa, synechoccocus elongatus, and mice  <cit> . in general, several interconnected transcription/translation feedback loops participate to establish central clock oscillations  <cit> . in plants, circadian rhythmicity is extensively investigated in a dicotyledonous model plant, arabidopsis thaliana, and a ‘three-loop model’ has been proposed  <cit> .

timing of cab expression 1/pseudo-response regulator  <dig>  and two partially redundant myb transcription factors, circadian clock-associated  <dig>  and late elongated hypocotyl  comprise a central oscillation loop  <cit> . cca <dig> and lhy repress transcript expression of toc <dig> by binding directly to its promoter, and as shown recently toc <dig> negatively regulates the transcription of cca <dig> and lhy  <cit> , establishing negative feedback loop  <cit> . the second loop is formed by toc <dig> and the evening complex  consisting of early flowering  <dig> , elf <dig>  and lux arrhythmo   <cit> . in addition, the third loop is established by negative feedback between prr7/prr <dig> and lhy/cca <dig>  <cit> .

protein turnover regulation provides another layer of sophistication in the regulation of the circadian clock. notably, the toc <dig> protein is regulated by proteasome-mediated protein degradation. the f-box protein zeitlupe  in the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase scf  complex ubiquitinates the toc <dig> protein through direct physical interaction in a dark-dependent manner  <cit> . homologs of ztl are also involved in circadian regulation of photoperiodic flowering  <cit> . the flavin-binding, kelch repeat, f-box 1/adagio <dig>  interacts with gi in a blue light-dependent manner and regulates constans expression by degrading a dof transcription factor, cycling dof factor  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that ztl, fkf <dig>  and lov kelch protein  <dig> together regulate toc <dig> and prr <dig> degradation, contributing to the circadian oscillation  <cit> .

recent works has shown that many of these circadian clock components can also be found in diverse plant species including rice, soybean, maize, and poplar  <cit> . cca1/lhy genes are widely conserved in eudicotyledonous  and monocotyledonous  plants  <cit> , and cca1/lhy and toc <dig> feedback loops are thought to play a central role in the clock’s function in these plant species. functional homologs of ztl have also been found in several plant species  <cit> , further supporting that circadian clock components are fairly well-conserved in plants.

despite the important role of the endogenous clock in entraining physiological processes to environmental signals, how the circadian clock regulates ecological performance of a plant in its natural habitat is largely unknown. only a few studies have shown that the endogenous clock allows plants to maximize photosynthetic capacity and reproductive success  <cit> . in order to expand our understanding of the clock function in biotic and abiotic interactions, we identified three core clock components  in a wild tobacco, nicotiana attenuata, which has been developed as a model system for understanding ecological performance in native habitats, in particular the great basin desert in utah. n. attenuata is a seasonal solanaceous plant, completing its life cycle during spring and summer to lie dormant in the seed bank for the many years between fires in its native habitat. these results provide additional evidence of the conservation of the circadian clock genes and set the stage for future studies to unravel the ecological relevance of the clock.

RESULTS
isolation of putative core circadian clock genes in n. attenuata
the full-length or partial sequences of three putative core circadian clock genes  in n. attenuata were isolated by blast search against in-house cdna library using the sequences of arabidopsis clock genes. we checked the diurnal expression of these transcripts in our time series microarray database  <cit> , which examined patterns of transcript accumulation in n. attenuata leaf and root tissues every 4 h for one day . to confirm the microarray data and examine circadian rhythms of the selected clock genes in n. attenuata, we analyzed the transcript accumulation of the candidate genes in seedlings grown under different light conditions. n. attenuata plants were grown under 16 h light/ 8 h dark cycle  for two weeks and subsequently transferred into continuous light condition . twenty seedlings in ld and ll were harvested every 2 h for three days. quantification of mrna expression was performed by quantitative real-time pcr  using the gene specific primers . we also constructed full-length of coding sequences of nalhy, natoc <dig>  and naztl , based on the ortholog sequences available in public est databases and arabidopsis database. to examine evolutionary relationship of circadian clock genes in plant species, phylogenetic trees were constructed using the upgma algorithm .

arabidopsis and poplar genomes contain two myb transcription factors , which play a key role in the regulation of the endogenous clock  <cit> . however, we found only one oscillating atlhy-like transcript in our cdna library . the transcript levels of nalhy in ld peaked at zeitgeber time 0 h  and remained low until the next zt 0 h , consistent with the patterns observed in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . nalhy transcript accumulation under ll maintained a circadian rhythm peaking near subjective dawn and showed a shorter period of time with an average  <dig>  h than under ld . protein sequence of nalhy shared a relatively high similarity with atlhy  and atcca <dig> . phylogenetic analysis indicated that nalhy was more closely related to atlhy than to atcca <dig> . the nalhy protein  is larger than atlhy , atcca <dig> , and oscca <dig>  but has the conserved sant domain at the n-terminal and the two alanine rich regions which characterize the atlhy and oscca <dig> proteins .

toc1/prr <dig> is a member of the prr family, which is composed of five oscillating genes; toc1/prr <dig>  prr <dig>  prr <dig>  prr <dig> and prr <dig>  each of prr genes has its own diurnal expression pattern  <cit> . the microarray data revealed that natoc <dig> transcripts peaked at zt 12 h  in accordance with the known circadian rhythm of the arabidopsis toc <dig> <cit> . the qpcr analysis showed that natoc <dig> transcripts peaked at zt 12 h under ld and the expression of natoc <dig> under ll peaked earlier by an average of  <dig>  h compared to the expression under ld . the full-length natoc <dig> protein sequence exhibited high similarity to attoc1/prr <dig> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that natoc <dig> is most closely related to atprr <dig> than to other atprrs . the rec domain at the n-terminal and the cct motif in the c-terminal of toc <dig> were conserved in n. attenuata, arabidopsis and o. sativa but the coiled-coil region was only found in the eudicots arabidopsis and n. attenuata .

the arabidopsis genome encodes three f-box proteins involved in protein degradation of the clock components  <cit> . we found two ztl orthologous genes  in our cdna library and named them according to the phylogenetic analysis . naztl transcripts under ll and ld were largely unchanged , consistent with the results from arabidopsis <cit> . in contrast, nafkf <dig> transcripts showed a clear circadian rhythm with peaks at zt 12 h under ld . the period of nafkf <dig> expression in ll was shortened by an average of 2 h . naztl had protein sequence similarity to atztl  and nafkf <dig> with that of atfkf <dig> . naztl and nafkf <dig> proteins contained lov/pas and f-box domains at their n-terminals and kelch repeats region in their c-terminals as shown in orthologs in arabidopsis .

ectopic expression of n. attenuata clock genes in arabidopsis
to examine the functional conservation of the clock components in n. attenuata, we produced arabidopsis  transgenic plants ectopically expressing nalhy and naztl genes under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter . the circadian clock entrains hypocotyl cell elongation to light–dark cycles, and thus plants overexpressing either arabidopsis lhy or ztl have elongated hypocotyls compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . we measured the hypocotyl lengths of 35s:nalhy  and 35s:naztl transgenic plants . two independent 35s:nalhy lines showed a pronounced increase in hypocotyl length compared to wild-type, col- <dig>  as did the two independent 35s:naztl lines .

the ability to perceive seasonal changes by the circadian clock is required for the successful transition from vegetative to reproductive stages. knocking-out a mor-ning element, arabidopsis lhy or cca <dig> results in an early-flowering phenotype and, in contrast, their overexpressing lines result in a late-flowering phenotype in arabidopsis  <cit> . the overexpression of arabidopsis ztl also results in a late-flowering phenotype under ld  <cit> . to examine the effect of nalhy and naztl on flowering time regulation in arabidopsis, we scored the rosette leaf number at a time when initial flowering was observed in plants grown under ld. both 35s:nalhy and 35s:naztl plants exhibited delayed flowering phenotypes and increased rosette leaf numbers .

interaction between natoc <dig> and naztl protein
f-box protein ztl plays a key role in protein turnover of the clock components, including toc <dig> by direct protein-protein interactions  <cit> . we determined whether natoc <dig> interacts with naztl by yeast two-hybrid analysis. in addition, we tested inter-species interactions of attoc1-naztl and atztl-natoc <dig>  full-length natoc <dig> proteins  fused with the gal <dig> activation domain , and naztl  fused with the gal <dig> binding domain  were co-expressed in yeast cells . the yeast cells expressing both natoc <dig> and naztl constructs grew well in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine, showing the positive interaction, consistent with arabidopsis toc <dig> and ztl interaction . the transformants expressing both natoc <dig> and naztl also exhibited strong β-galactosidase activity compared to control yeast cells carrying empty vectors or only one of the constructs . inter-species protein interactions of attoc1-naztl and atztl-natoc <dig> were as strong as the intra-species interactions of toc <dig> and ztl .

silencing of natoc <dig> in n. attenuata
to examine the conserved and unique functions of circadian clock genes in n. attenuata, we first silenced natoc <dig> expression by constitutive overexpression of natoc1-specific inverted repeat  sequences   <cit> . toc <dig> in arabidopsis plays a key role in flowering time regulation. the semi-dominant toc1- <dig> mutant displays a late-flowering phenotype under ld and an early-flowering phenotype under short day conditions   <cit>  and the toc1- <dig> loss-of-function mutant shows no significant difference of flowering time under ld but an early-flowering phenotype under sd  <cit> . during the screening of the silenced lines, we clearly observed the late-flowering phenotypes of several independent irtoc <dig> lines under ld . two independent lines were used to measure flowering time and rosette leaf number when the first flower opened . the silencing efficiency of independent lines harboring the rnai construct correlated strongly with the flowe-ring phenotype . in one homozygous irtoc1- <dig> line, screened on the basis of antibiotic resistance, but in which the toc <dig> gene expression was not silenced, presumably due to methylation of the ir part of the t-dna or an unknown insertion effect, displayed a wt flowering pattern .

discussion
since the clock genes of arabidopsis have been identified, the clock mechanism of arabidopsis has been extended to other dicotyledonous plants; soybean  <cit> , chestnut  <cit> , brassica rapa <cit> , poplar  <cit>  and also to monocotyledonous plants; rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , duckweed  <cit> . here, we identified three core circadian clock genes in a wild tobacco, n. attenuata. analyses of the circadian rhythms of transcript accumulation and protein similarity allowed us to identify orthologs of lhy, toc <dig>  and ztl of arabidopsis in n. attenuata. protein interactions of toc <dig> and ztl in arabidopsis were also conserved in n. attenuata. in addition, ectopic expression of nalhy and naztl in arabidopsis confirmed the functional conservation of lhy and ztl in n. attenuata. we also demonstrated that natoc <dig> in n. attenuata plays an important role in the regulation of flowering time.

the number of lhy  orthologous genes and the timing of gene duplication events differ among plant species  <cit> . one common ancestor of lhy/cca <dig> independently duplicated in monocots and eudicots. populus nigra and p. trichocarpa contain two lhy orthologs and the monocots, rice and sorghum bicolor contain one cca1-like gene in their genome  <cit> . gene duplication events of lhy/cca <dig> in popular and arabidopsis would be expected in n. attenuata but we were able to find only one lhy/cca <dig> like gene in n. attenuata. however, the second ortholog could be missing in our current cdna library and we plan to perform deep sequencing of the transcriptome and microarray analysis of plants grown under a variety of conditions in the future to clarify the evolutionary relationship of n. attenuata’s lhy orthologs.

while components of the endogenous clock and their associated circadian clock mechanisms have clearly been maintained across diverse plant species, clock-mediated signaling has evolved in response to differing selection pressures. a perennial plant, chestnut  has orthologs of atlhy and attoc <dig> in its genome and the pattern of transcript accumulation of cslhy and cstoc <dig> is similar to that of arabidopsis in ld at 22°c  <cit> . however, in winter condition, both cslhy and cstoc <dig> transcripts lose their diurnal rhythms and maintain high levels of transcripts, which may be associated with the induction of winter dormancy  <cit> . even within a single species, a. thaliana, genetic variation in the clock components plays a critical role in adapting ecotypes to their local environment  <cit> . genetic variation in the prr genes is associated with local adaptation seen in the differential expression of quantitative trait loci in  <dig> arabidopsis ecotypes  <cit> . in addition, the degree to which toc <dig> regulates flowering time differs among arabidopsis ecotypes. a semi-dominant toc1- <dig> mutant of the arabidopsis c <dig> ecotype displays late a flowering phenotype in ld, whereas the same toc <dig> mutation in the landsberg ecotype results in no change in flowering time compared with wt plants under ld  <cit> . the toc1- <dig> mutant shows also no change in flowering time under ld  <cit> . however, silencing toc <dig> in n. attenuata confers a late-flowering phenotype under ld, which may be due to the longer life span of n. attenuata  or different circadian clock functions have evolved under various environmental pressures. in future research, we plan to measure the flowering time of irtoc <dig> lines under sd to examine the light sensitivity of this transgenic line.

we have investigated the ecology of n. attenuata in its native habitat for more than twenty years. during this period, we have observed interesting diurnal rhythmic traits of n. attenuata and time-of-day dependent ecological interactions. for example, n. attenuata interacts with different groups of herbivores which are either day-active  or night-active  and produces different chemicals that function as direct defenses against these herbivores or function as indirect defenses and attract of predators of the herbivores  <cit> . recently, we showed that tissue specific diurnal rhythm of metabolites and its related transcripts in n. attenuata changes in response to herbivore attack of a specialist, m. sexta larvae  <cit> . more than 15% of total metabolites that we measured in leaf and root shows diurnal patterns and some of them have been demonstrated to function as plant defenses against herbivore attack. goodspeed et al.  <cit>  have recently reported that feeding behavior of tricoplusia ni is predicted by the circadian clock in its host plant arabidopsis and it increases anti-herbivore defense of arabidopsis. all of these interactions provide a rich arena in which to explore the molecular mechanism of how the circadian clock regulates plant-insect interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified three core circadian clock components in n. attenuata based on the gene expression and phenotypic alterations in lines silenced or overexpressed in the components. this work provides the foundation for the manipulation the ecological roles of the circadian clock in nature. as jet travel has revealed the depth of circadian-regulated processes in humans, circadian mutants of n. attenuata will be used to unravel the ecological functions of the clock in plant-environment, plant-plant, and plant-insect interactions in nature.
