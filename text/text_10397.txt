BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies , which generally assay common variation and rely on relatively large effects, are now being widely applied to perform genome-wide scans for variants associated with pharmacological phenotypes  <cit> . in the case of complex diseases, gwas have yielded associated variants with modest overall effects. however, in the case of pharmacological phenotypes, initial results from pharmacogenomic gwas appear to indicate a greater ability to discover variants with substantial effect size  <cit> . nevertheless, pharmacogenomic gwas suffer many of the limitations of disease gwas in that follow up studies are often required to elucidate the causative genes and variants latent in the gwas results  <cit> . additionally, pharmacogenomic gwas are also limited in power by small cohort sizes  <cit> . amongst the drugs whose pharmacological variance has been evaluated using the gwas approach, warfarin  has emerged as a prominent pharmacogenomics case study with great translational potential.

given the its broad use, narrow therapeutic range, and severity of side effects, a comprehensive pharmacogenomic characterization of warfarin dose-response offers the potential for substantial clinical impact  <cit> . retrospective studies revealed the role of vkorc <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  and cyp4f <dig> in mediating abnormal variations in warfarin dose response  <cit> , explaining approximately 30%, 10% and 5% of the variance in drug response respectively  <cit> . the relationship between variants in these genes and atypical warfarin dose response has been subsequently confirmed by gwas analysis  <cit> . recently, a method to estimate stable warfarin dose was developed by integrating information on patient vkorc <dig> and cyp2c <dig> genotypes with clinical factors  <cit> . although this method incorporated genotype information for only two warfarin pharmacogenes, the genotype-based method was able to explain ~49% of the variance in stable dose, substantially outperforming the pure-clinical and fixed-dose approaches. the elucidation of additional large-effect pharmacogenes for warfarin and other genomic features might serve to dramatically increase the ability to predict warfarin dose response from genotype.

therefore, in this study, we propose a novel method for increasing the power of pharmacogenomic gwas and detecting pharmacogenes predictive of drug response. our method characterizes the degree to which uncommon alleles of a gene correlate with drug response. if uncommon alleles are associated with atypical drug response phenotypes, then the gene is considered a predictive pharmacogene and a putative marker for drug response.

RESULTS
using knowledge to limit the hypothesis testing space
we identified  <dig> genes which were likely to be pharmacogenes for warfarin and which also contained snps measured in the cooper warfarin response gwas data set . there were  <dig>  snps contained within these  <dig> genes. we tested each of the  <dig>  snps with a univariate linear regression model for its ability to predict warfarin dosage, the exact analysis performed by cooper, et al., however, with the advantage of testing fewer hypotheses. as expected, the results of this analysis closely resemble the results of the cooper analysis except that a much less strict significance threshold is necessary to correct for multiple hypothesis testing . however, even with this lower threshold only one snp, rs <dig> , was significant after correction .

derivation and evaluation of a candidate gene-score based on allele frequencies
w assigned each snp to a gene if the snp was within  <dig> kbp of the boundary of the gene. some snps mapped to more than one gene. we then aggregated the snps into genes using this mapping and calculate each gene’s phap gene-scores . each gene-score was then tested with a univariate linear regression model for its ability to predict warfarin dosage, again, the same analysis performed by cooper, except that we now are testing only  <dig> hypotheses and each gene-score is a summary of a set of snps frequencies. in this analysis both vkorc <dig> and cyp2c <dig> are significant for predicting stable warfarin dosage . vkorc <dig> and cyp2c <dig> pass the corrected significance threshold of 1e- <dig> with p-values of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> respectively.

extreme dose response warfarin response models
the gene-score was calculated for each of the  <dig> genes in the wsp for each patient in two classes: low dose patients and the compliment. the distributions of gene-scores of the two classes were tested for the null hypothesis, namely that the means of the distributions were equal. two genes significantly distinguish the two classes after corrected for multiple hypothesis testing, vkorc <dig> and ube3a with p-values of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> respectively.  <dig> other genes had p-values that were less than  <dig> , but not significant after multiple hypothesis testing .

a logistic regression classification model was trained on vkorc <dig> and ube3a gene-scores and evaluated with 10-fold cross validation . the auroc was  <dig>  . a second logistic regression classification model was trained on the  <dig> genes that had a p-value ≤  <dig>  . the auroc of this classifier was  <dig>  .

analogously for the high-dose model, three genes were found to have significant p-values after multiple hypothesis testing, vkorc <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  and qtrtd1: p-values of  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig>  and  <dig> e- <dig> respectively.  <dig> other genes had p-values ≤  <dig>  before multiple hypothesis correction .

discussion
in this study we present a novel method for integrating pre-existing pharmacological knowledge and scoring candidate genes from association studies. we have demonstrated that this filtering and scoring method is capable of identifying candidate genes explaining a large proportion of warfarin dose response phenotypes.

our phap value is a simple measure of how “extreme” an individual’s variants are in a particular gene: if all the snps show minor alleles, then the individual has a very high phap value for that gene. if all the snps show major alleles, then the individual has a low value for that gene. we have shown that this aggregate measure of genotype has the advantage of aggregating genetic variation in order to reduce the number of hypotheses tested. this measure cannot only increase the power to identify candidate genes that explain dosage variation but also can identify candidate genes for extreme phenotypes.

we validate our methods on the warfarin gwas study by cooper et al, which attempted to identify candidate genes by examining a snps ability to predict dosage in a univariate linear regression model. the power of the cooper analysis, however, was limited by the low number of patients in the cohort, a common problem in drug gwas <cit> . when our methods were applied to the same data set we were able to identify the two best characterized genes responsible for variation in warfarin dose response, vkorc <dig> and cyp2c <dig>  it is interesting to note that the knowledge filtration method alone will not identify both of these two genes . the phap, which summarizes the aggregate contribution of a set of snps, is also needed in order to identify cyp2c <dig> significantly .

we also show that our method can significantly identify features for a machine learning classification algorithm. we achieve high performance when classifying between low/not low-dose patients and between high/not-high dose patients . using an empirical bootstrapping approach we demonstrated that the genes our method identifies are significant. in both cases the auroc of the model was the highest observed, corresponding to a p-value <  <dig> .

we acknowledge that the described method is dependant being able to identify potentially important pharmacogenes. it is important to note that the algorithm we employed to rank genes for their potential to be pharmacogenomic does not require the drug to be previously known and will predict pharmacogenes for novel chemical structures.

the results of this study offer support for the applicability of allele-based pharmacogenetic models for the prediction of drug response phenotype. in addition, it opens up new avenues for candidate pharmacogene discovery. in future work we plan to improve our method through the investigation of more sophisticated classification methods and identification of additional genetic and genomic features predictive of drug response. we will also seek to expand the application of our method to additional drugs, with the overarching aim of developing a method that is predictive and robust across a broad range of drugs. we also plan to investigate the warfarin-associated pharmacogenes identified by our approach and work to biologically validate their putative role in warfarin response.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a novel approach that incorporates pharmacogenomic knowledge integration and a gene scoring system based on snp aggregation to enhance pharmacogene discovery from pharmacogenomics gwas. we applied this approach to a published warfarin gwas data set comprising  <dig> individuals and found that our method can increase the power of the gwas to identify established warfarin pharmacogenes vkorc <dig> and cyp2c <dig>  and implicate several novel warfarin pharmacogenes. additionally, we find that our method can be used to discriminate between low-dose  and high-dose  responders, establishing a basis of direct clinical utility for the approach. based on the performance observed with the warfarin gwas, we recommend future work to extend the approach and apply it to additional pharmacogenomic gwas as well as gwas characterising other traits of clinical interest.
