BACKGROUND
the enzyme porphobilinogen synthase  catalyzes the first common step in the biosynthesis of the tetrapyrrole pigments such as heme, chlorophyll, and cobalamin  <cit> . pbgs is very highly conserved in sequence and structure but contains a remarkable phylogenetic variation in metal ion usage for catalytic and allosteric functions  <cit> . as of  <dig>  approximately one-half of the ~ <dig> pbgs sequences available contained the binding determinants for a catalytic zinc ion, and about one-half did not  <cit> . on the other hand, approximately 90% of the known pbgs sequences contain the binding determinants for an allosteric magnesium. the only known pbgs sequences that lack the binding determinants for both the catalytic zinc and the allosteric magnesium are in the bacterial genus rhodobacter  <cit> . these atypical pbgs expressed by rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus were two of the earliest pbgs enzymes to be characterized in the pioneering work of shemin and coworkers and were erroneously chosen as representative of pbgs from all photosynthetic organisms  <cit> . however, one distinct difference between the ∝-proteobacteria, of which r. capsulatus is an example, and other photosynthetic organisms is the biosynthetic pathway used to produce the pbgs substrate, 5-aminolevulinic acid . the ∝-proteobacteria synthesize ala from succinyl-coa and glycine while other photosynthetic organisms use glutamic acid to make ala  <cit> .

in light of the vast information now available on phylogenetic variations in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and on the pbgs that require a catalytic zinc and/or that utilize an allosteric magnesium, the current study revisits the pbgs of rhodobacter capsulatus with emphasis on understanding the enzyme's unique characteristics. since other pbgs have been shown to absolutely require divalent cations for catalytic activity, and in light of the enhanced purity of modern reagents, it is important to revisit the metal ion requirements of r. capsulatus pbgs to test the predictions of the sequence analysis that suggests the absence of any metal binding determinants. herein we present evidence that there is absolutely no effect of zn2+ or mg2+ on the activity of the enzyme and no other metal ions appear to be required for enzyme function. prior studies have also shown that some pbgs enzymes exhibit a ph rate profile whose pka value is altered by the presence of monovalent cations  <cit> . hence, we include an analysis of enzyme activity in relation to ph and monovalent cations.

the native holoenzyme quaternary structure for pbgs from most species is a homo-octamer as supported by  <dig> deposited pbgs crystal structures from yeast, human, e. coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and noncrystallographic cross-linking data on pbgs from the green plant pea  <cit> . however, an alternative hexameric structural variant was revealed by the crystal structure of a rare allele of human pbgs  <cit> . the hexameric structure suggests a functional relationship between binding of the allosteric magnesium of most pbgs and a putative hexamer-octamer distribution that serves as the structural basis for allosteric regulation of enzyme function  <cit> . in the absence of the binding sites for either catalytic or allosteric metal ions we investigated the oligomeric structure of r. capsulatus pbgs, and results suggest that the protein is a homo-hexamer. we present a homology model of the hexameric r. capsulatus pbgs structure.

RESULTS
cloning and sequencing
the cloning of the hemb gene  from r. capsulatus was accomplished by pcr using primers based upon the sequence of indest and biel . the sequence of the cloned gene differed from that published previously. figure  <dig> presents an alignment of the predicted polypeptides based on the published r. capsulatus and r. sphaeroides sequences  as well as the sequence determined from our pcr product . the changes in the predicted polypeptides are due to three differences that we observe when comparing the nucleotide sequence determined herein with the published sequence: a deletion of g at position  <dig>  an insertion of an a at position  <dig>  and reversal of the ac at positions 643– <dig> to ca. the first two sequence differences result in alteration of the predicted amino acid sequence from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  the third sequence difference alters the amino acid at position  <dig> from leucine to isoleucine. based on the aligned polypeptide sequence, the newly determined sequence appears more homologous to r. sphaeroides pbgs, and hence is deduced to be the correct sequence.

expression and purification
as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  we were able to express and achieve substantial purification of r. capsulatus pbgs. the specific activities of the ultracentrifuge supernatant, redissolved ammonium sulfate pellet, phenyl-sepharose pool, deae pool, and concentrated s- <dig> pool were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol h- <dig> mg - <dig> respectively. we suspect that some of this variation is due to a protein concentration dependence to the specific activity . the enzyme has an apparent molecular weight that is in agreement with the predicted mass of  <dig>  kda . based on sds-page and silver staining, the protein appears to have been purified to homogeneity.

protein concentration dependence of the specific activity
other pbgs that lack the catalytic zinc ion binding site have been shown to exhibit a protein concentration dependence to the specific activity  <cit>  this unusual phenomenon indicates that a maximally active oligomer can dissociate into less active smaller units. a protein concentration dependent specific activity is illustrated for r. capsulatus pbgs in figure  <dig>  the maximal r. capsulatus pbgs activity, ~ <dig> μmol h- <dig> mg - <dig>  is the highest ever seen for a purified pbgs, and the lowest r. capsulatus pbgs activity, ~ <dig> μmol h- <dig> mg- <dig>  shows that the smallest oligomeric structure retains significant activity. as shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of the smaller unit is significantly different from what is documented for pbgs that lack the catalytic zinc but contain the allosteric magnesium binding site; in those instances, the smallest oligomers are inactive  <cit> . kinetic characteristics described below use protein concentrations varying from  <dig> – <dig> μg ml- <dig> and this variation does not appear to effect the pka values apparent from the ph rate profiles, the km values, or the effects of metal ions or metal ion chelators, which suggest that these properties are more or less the same for the largest and smallest oligomer.

kinetic characteristics
metal ion requirements of purified r. capsulatus pbgs were determined and the results confirm that the rhodobacter enzyme is different in its response to a variety of cations compared to most known pbgs enzymes. at a protein concentration of ~ <dig> μg ml- <dig> there is no significant stimulation or inhibition of r. capsulatus pbgs by the addition of zn2+ or mg2+ ions. the presence of zn2+, up to  <dig> μm, caused no change in activity and inclusion of  <dig> mm mg2+ resulted in 86% activity. there is also no apparent inhibition by the addition of  <dig> mm edta or by pretreatment with chelex resin. inclusion of  <dig> -phenanthroline from concentrations of  <dig> μm –  <dig> mm had no effect on r. capsulatus pbgs activity. the purified enzyme was tested for the presence of zinc and magnesium by atomic absorption spectroscopy; under conditions where it would have been possible to detect as little as  <dig>  metal ion per subunit, none were detected.

previous experiments with a wide variety of pbgs enzymes suggest that monovalent cations can affect the activity of the enzyme. such cations were clearly shown to shift the ph rate profile for some pbgs  <cit> . results presented in table i  suggest that there is little if any effect of the monovalent cations k+, na+ or nh4+ over a wide range of concentrations . figure  <dig> shows that inclusion of  <dig>  m kcl has no significant effect on the ph rate profile at  <dig> μg ml- <dig> protein concentration.

to determine the optimal ph for the enzyme we determined the vmax and km values at ~ <dig> μg ml- <dig> protein at a variety of ph values as presented in figure  <dig>  the results demonstrate that maximal activity was observed around ph  <dig> , but the enzyme is still very active over a wide range of ph values. it is also clear that the km value drastically increases at lower ph values, which is similar to what has been observed for other pbgs enzymes e.g., human pbgs  <cit> , e. coli pbgs  <cit> , or b. japonicum pbgs  <cit> . based on the references cited, the rise in km at low ph appears to be independent of the metal ion requirements for pbgs.

quaternary structure
a recent paper described an alternative quaternary structure for a rare allele of human pbgs. the unprecedented structural change was shown to have significant effects on the enzyme activity  <cit> . in contrast to the active octameric human pbgs, a hexameric form observed with the rare human allele was relatively inactive. the interconversion of these two oligomeric structures was related to the allosteric regulation of some non-human pbgs by magnesium. to assess the different oligomerization states possible for r. capsulatus pbgs, a native gel analysis was performed and the gel was stained for enzyme activity followed by coomassie staining for protein . previous studies have shown that native gel electrophoresis can give good separation of the quaternary structure forms of pbgs . four different sized complexes are observed whose mobility fit well to an mixture of dimer, tetramer, hexamer, and octamer . as had been seen before for e. coli pbgs  <cit> , the distribution of these oligomeric forms is altered by substrate. by comparing samples preincubated without substrate  with samples preincubated in the presence of substrate  it can be observed that the complex that runs as the smallest form  becomes less prominent and the largest molecular weight complex  becomes visible. it is also interesting to note that no activity is observed for the two smallest complexes .

based upon a combination of size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, the size of the major complex was determined. the major component in size exclusion chromatography ran at an approximate molecular weight of  <dig>  daltons. the predicted molecular weight for a monomer is  <dig>  daltons so it would appear that r. capsulatus pbgs is predominantly a hexamer.

ultracentrifugation data for samples collected at several speeds were fit well using a single species model and show that the r. capsulatus pbgs is largely a hexamer . the molecular weight obtained from a global fit to data collected at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  rpm is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and was largely independent of speed, indicating strong evidence for ideal single species behaviour. since we do observe a slight trend in decreasing molecular weight with increasing speed, we further analyzed the data by considering more complex two state models . the lowest apparent molecular weight from table ii was no smaller than that expected for a hexamer so we mainly considered models with the hexamer and some larger second state. a lack of lower molecular weight species is not surprising since the protein concentration dependence of the activity plateaus at about  <dig> μm and the loading concentration in the au is greater than ten-fold higher. as judged by the square roots of variance for the fits of the various models to the data, collected either in dithiothreitol  or 2-mercaptoethanol , we saw no appreciable improvement in the fits relative to the pure hexamer model. in the one instance where a slight improvement was noted , less than 5% of the total absorbance could be ascribed to the octamer, suggesting very little higher order self-association. prolonged dialysis results in some non-specific aggregation, presumably due to a build-up of oxidized dtt or βme, and may provide an explanation for problems with unwanted aggregation. finally, we also tested the possibility that the apparent molecular weight from single species analysis might instead reflect a proportionation between an octamer and some smaller species. we were able to rule this out as such models resulted in poorer fits to the data .

r. capsulatus pbgs hexamer homology model
discussion
prior to the current work, it appeared that there was a considerable sequence diversion in a  <dig> amino acid segment between r. capsulatus and r. sphaeroides pbgs. the revised sequence for r. capsulatus pbgs presented shows close homology between the pbgs of the two rhodobacter species. this is interesting in light of the apparent differences between these enzymes regarding monovalent cation usage. the r. sphaeroides enzyme is reported to be stimulated by monovalent cations  <cit> , while the r. capsulatus is not affected by monovalent cations. while it was previously tempting to ascribe the difference in response between the enzymes to this region, clearly this is not the case.

to further analyze the enzymatic characteristics of the r. capsulatus pbgs, the enzyme was purified after being heterologously expressed in e. coli. the purification has allowed us to carry out definitive experiments on the requirements for r. capsulatus pbgs function.

based on sequence comparisons and known crystal structures for some pbgs, the rhodobacter pbgs appear to constitute a unique form of the enzyme that does not require metal ions for structure, activity, or allosteric regulation  <cit> . although the original description of the rhodobacter pbgs enzymes  <cit>  did not demonstrate a requirement for metal ions, the reagents of that time period are now known to be contaminated with metal ions, particularly zinc. the current reagents are of better quality, thus allowing us to confirm the metal requirements for r. capsulatus pbgs. r. capsulatus pbgs activity is independent of all metal ions tested.

it has been proposed that chloroplast containing photosynthetic organisms use the allosteric regulation of pbgs by magnesium as part of a complex control of the biosynthesis of chlorophyll  <cit> . although rhodobacter capsulatus makes a similar pigment, bacteriochlorophyll, the pbgs enzyme from this organism does not exhibit any regulation by divalent cations. in the absence of the allosteric magnesium, rhodobacter must use alternative mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive intermediates in the biosynthesis of its physiologically relevant tetrapyrroles.

the preferred ph for enzyme function was determined by measuring vmax and km in a systematic fashion. based upon these analyses, the apparent ph optimum is approximately ph  <dig> , but the enzyme demonstrates significant activity from ph 7– <dig>  the km value at optimal ph is still high  relative to other pbgs at their optimal ph in the presence of their required metal ions . this suggests that an unknown factor may be required in vivo. because there have been reports for stimulation of pbgs enzymes from other organisms by the addition of monovalent cations, several monovalent cations were tested for their ability to stimulate enzyme function at the ph optimum. at the ph optimum no stimulation by monovalent cations was observed .

the rare human allele for pbgs encoding f12l revealed the possibility for alternative quaternary structures of pbgs that have been proposed to form the basis for allosteric regulation of pbgs that contain an allosteric magnesium binding site  <cit> . these types of pbgs are found in all plants, all archaea, and all bacteria except those of the genus rhodobacter  <cit> . evidence for alternate quaternary forms of pbgs is particularly apparent for those pbgs that contain the allosteric magnesium but do not contain the catalytic zinc, because these forms exhibit a protein concentration dependence to their specific activity as illustrated in figure  <dig> <cit> . the protein concentration dependence has been proposed to be due to an equilibrium between a fully active octamer and an inactive hexamer  <cit> , which is consistent with the data for pea and b japonicum pbgs presented in figure  <dig>  the data for r. capsulatus pbgs suggests however that the active form of this protein is a hexamer of specific activity ~ <dig> μmol h- <dig> mg- <dig>  and that this active hexamer can dissociate into a smaller form that is less active, but not inactive, with a specific activity of ~ <dig> μmol h- <dig> mg- <dig>  these observations lead to three interrelated questions. why does r. capsulatus pbgs associate into a hexamer rather than an octamer; why is the r. capsulatus pbgs hexamer of high activity rather than of low activity; and what is the less active quaternary structure that is in equilibrium with the r. capsulatus pbgs hexamer?

to answer these questions, we need to address the factors that govern the interconversion of pbgs quaternary forms and the structural basis for the different activities associated with these different quaternary forms. crystal structures reveal that those pbgs that readily interconvert between quaternary forms contain subunit-subunit interfaces that are hydrophilic in character. for instance, in the p. aeruginosa pbgs structure, the interaction of the barrel of subunit a and the n-terminal arm of subunit b, which form a hugging interaction, is dominated by hydrogen bonds and buried water molecules. one could argue that this type of subunit-subunit interface can readily dissociate because the protein-protein interactions are similar in energy to aqueous solvation of the protein surfaces  <cit> . a sequence comparison between p. aeruginosa pbgs and r. capsulatus pbgs shows that the amino acids that lie at the hugging dimer interface of the former are of lower hydrogen bonding and ion pairing capacity in the latter, which might explain why r. capsulatus pbgs is not an octamer. as for the functional difference between human octameric and hexameric pbgs, this has been ascribed to the mobility/stability of an active site lid that serves to gate access to solvent  <cit> . in that case, destabilization of the lid causes the ph rate optimum for the reaction to shift dramatically toward basic ph and causes a dramatic decrease in affinity for the km determining substrate molecule since the lid residues form part of the binding site for this substrate  <cit> . consistent with the fact that r. capsulatus pbgs appears to be a hexamer, the ph optimum is basic and the km is  <dig> –  <dig> fold higher than most other pbgs species under their optimal assay conditions. crystallization trials for r. capsulatus pbgs are currently underway to provide insight into these fascinating questions. finally, based on the native gel analysis, we propose that the active r. capsulatus pbgs hexamer can dissociate into a less active dimer. preliminary unpublished results suggest that one can produce an active dimeric species of human pbgs by destabilizing the dimer-dimer interactions that are essential for oligomerization of pbgs into either the hexamer or the octamer.

CONCLUSIONS
the evidence presented in this paper supports the unusual position of the r. capsulatus pbgs as not requiring any metal ions for catalytic function, which may be characteristic of the rhodobacter genus. unlike other wild-type pbgs, the r. capsulatus protein is a hexamer. what remains to be determined is how the reaction mechanism for this enzyme might differ from those pbgs that show both an absolute requirement for metal ions and an octameric quaternary structure.
