BACKGROUND
fetal bovine serum  obtained from the clotted blood of the bovine fetus, is a common supplement to in vitro culture media. it contains a wide range of growth factors, hormones, vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids and trace elements required for cell growth and, for this reason, was introduced early in cell biology research  <cit> . it is well-known that animal sera exhibit very high levels of batch to batch variations which can affect cellular proliferation, differentiation, and function. for instance, considerable lots of fbs contain significant levels of lipopolysaccharides which can affect the production of tumor necrosis factor by macrophages  <cit> . in the case of the c2c <dig> cell line, which is typically used as a ‘model systems’ for understanding muscle growth and development, it has been demonstrated that differences in hormonal content depending on serum origin  caused a shift in calcium handling, resulting in a dramatic change in muscle cell spontaneous contractility  <cit> . recently, it was shown that animal sera contain extracellular vesicles   which also have important biological properties ranging from intercellular communication and angiogenesis to cell survival. these vesicles can be distinguished by their size and lipid composition: microvesicles  originate from blebbing of the plasma membrane, exosomes  originate from fusion of late endosomes  with the plasma membrane, and apoptotic bodies  originate from apoptotic cells. evs, containing certain combinations of lipids, adhesion and intercellular signaling molecules as well as rnas, participate in intercellular communication processes  <cit> . depending on their origin, evs can modulate immune-regulatory processes, set up tumor escape mechanisms and mediate regenerative or degenerative processes, amongst others. numerous studies have reported changes in ev composition induced by modifications of the culture conditions, which can mimic different extracellular environments or different physiological or differentiation states of the secreting cells. thus evs in biological fluids such as serum or plasma are now considered as biomarkers for diagnosis purposes  <cit> . recently,  <dig> studies have suggested that evs from bovine serum could substantially influence cultured cell behavior and phenotype  as vesicle-depleted fbs have reduced capacity to support cell growth. it was also described that fbs vesicles mediated anchorage-independent growth of breast carcinoma cells  <cit>  and thus were necessary for cellular adhesion. as muscle cells are very dependent on fbs origin for proliferation and differentiation  <cit> , we wondered whether evs present in fbs also affected myoblasts proliferation and differentiation and thus if fbs-evs could influence cultured muscle cell phenotype.

therefore, in this study we have determined the specific effect of fbs-evs on myoblast proliferation and differentiation using mouse and rat muscle cell lines or human primary myoblasts. our results show that removal of evs from fbs affected proliferation of myoblasts and committed cells to differentiate precociously. in addition, the expression of myomirs important for the myogenic process and induced during myoblast proliferation  are significantly decreased in c2c <dig>  myoblasts constantly grown in ev-depleted media during proliferation and differentiation formed less myotubes than myoblasts grown in normal serum. however, this study shows a divergence in muscle cell differentiation, depending on the origins of the myoblasts, towards ev-depleted treatments. thus, researchers studying the role of muscle evs in culture conditions should consider that depleting evs from fbs significantly alters the phenotype of muscle cells by affecting gene and mirna expressions during proliferation.

RESULTS
fetal serums may contain more than a thousand components, many related to factors that have been shown to have a large effect on the muscle cell development. the identities and concentrations of these substances in serum are not well characterized. therefore the use of serum introduces a large number of confounding variables to any experiment. in this study we tested the role of evs on myoblast proliferation and differentiation using the mouse cell line c2c <dig>  the rat cell line l <dig> and human primary myoblasts isolated from muscle biopsies.

evs were removed from sera by ultracentrifugation for at least 18 h based on previous observations suggesting that shorter centrifugation time periods are not sufficient to get ev-free sera  <cit> . proteins of the ev pellets were quantified using the bradford protein assay . we estimated that 10 % fbs dmem contained 10 μg of ev-derived proteins per ml of medium. the size of the particles and their concentrations were also analysed with nanoparticle tracking analysis . nta calculation of ev-derived proteins produced a concentration which was  <dig> times less than obtained when quantified with bpa indicating that evs might be contaminated with other proteins, likely serum albumin and immunoglobulin  <cit> . the vesicle size distribution determined by nta displayed a bell-shaped curve with a peak at 81 nm  in agreement with the reported size of evs . as sera are usually filtered at  <dig>  um by the supplier, it is likely that the ev pellet is strongly enriched in exosomal vesicles, which are smaller than microparticles and apoptotic bodies  <cit> . in agreement, classical exosomal markers were detected by wb and tem on fbs-evs .fig.  <dig> fetal bovine serum  contain exosome-like vesicles. fbs-derived vesicles were pellet at  <dig>  g for 18 h, resuspended in pbs and re-pelleted at  <dig>  g for 70 min. a fbs-ev size distributions measured with nanosight. b immuno-blotting for enriched exosomal proteins in fbs ; c2c <dig> released exosomes were used as positive controls . tsg101 = tumor susceptibility gene  <dig>  cd81 = cluster of differentiation  <dig> . c tem images of purified fbs-evs. nanovesicles are labeled with anti-cd <dig> gold particles to confirm their exosomal origin



removal evs from culture medium affects myoblast proliferation
myoblasts, plated at the same density, were grown either in control media  or in serum evs-depleted media  . after 3 days, light microscopy analysis showed that sedm affected myoblast proliferation . in agreement, the number of nuclei was higher for the cells grown in cm than in sedm .fig.  <dig> fbs-derived vesicles are involved in myoblast proliferation. a light-microscopy  of representative wells from c2c <dig>  l <dig> or human primary myoblasts grown in 6-well plates either in normal proliferative medium or ev-depleted proliferative medium. b mean number of nuclei per well



c2c <dig> and l <dig> grown in sedm had reduced cyclin d <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna levels, two important genes involved in cell proliferation  <cit> , compared to cm-treated cells . cyclin d <dig> reduction level was also observed for human myoblasts grown in sedm . it has to be noticed that human myoblasts are grown with only 2 % fbs conversely to l <dig> and c2c <dig> which are cultured with 10 % fbs, suggesting that even at low concentrations, fbs-evs have an impact on cell proliferation. we also measured the expression of genes involved in multivesicular bodie formation . indeed, besides their newly identified roles in cell-cell communications, it should not be forgotten that evs release is the major route for protein and lipid recycling during plasma membrane remodeling. thus, evs secretion is highly stimulated during cell proliferation. we found that vps37b and vps4a were decreased at the transcriptional level in c2c <dig> myoblasts grown in sedm and vps4a was reduced in l <dig> myoblasts, suggesting that reducing proliferation also reduced ev formation and vesicular trafficking. although not significant, the same tendency was observed for human myoblasts grown without serum evs fig.  <dig> removing fbs-derived vesicles from bovine serum affects gene expression. quantitative rt-pcr of relevant genes for proliferation , differentiation , metabolism  and vesicle trafficking and ev release . data are expressed as fold compared to cm, normalized by house keeping gene . in white, cells grown in control media containing fbs-evs , in black, cells grown in cm depleted of fbs-evs . a c2c <dig> myoblasts; b l <dig> rat myoblasts; c human primary myoblasts



in the case of muscle cells, cell cycle exit and differentiation are coupled during myogenesis  <cit> . thus, to determine whether reduced myoblast proliferation in sedm was correlated with the entrance in the differentiation step, we measured the expression of myogenin, considered as one of the earliest molecular markers for myotube formation in vitro, and myod, which cooperate with cyclind <dig> during proliferation  <cit> . as shown on fig. 3a-b-c, myoblasts grown in sedm exhibited higher level of myogenin mrna than control cells, strongly suggesting that these growth conditions induced myoblast growth arrest and committed cells to differentiate precociously. in agreement, myod mrna level was reduced in c2c <dig>  concomitantly to cyclin d <dig> . in addition, the expression of myomirs important in the myogenic process, which are induced during myoblast proliferation , were significantly decreased in c2c <dig> grown in sedm, confirming exit from the proliferation step and entrance in the differentiation process .fig.  <dig> removing fbs-derived vesicles from bovine serum affects myomir expression in c2c <dig>  quantification of mir- <dig>  mir-133a and mir- <dig> in c2c <dig>  grown either in cm  or in evs-depleted proliferation media . data are expressed as ct values



removing evs from sera delays myoblasts differentiation
although myoblasts grown in serum evs-depleted media had reduced rate of proliferation, they were able to proliferate until confluence. after confluence , myoblast differentiation was induced by replacing proliferation media with either control media containing serum evs  or with differentiation media without serum evs  . after 8 days post-differentiation, cells were harvested for rna extraction and gene expression analysis. as shown on fig. 5b-c-d-e, cells constantly grown in ev-depleted media during proliferation and differentiation , formed less myotubes than cells grown in control media . in agreement c2c <dig> and human cells had a reduced level of myogenin mrna  and a strong increase in myostatin expression  . c2c <dig> and human cells constantly grown in ev-depleted media also had altered mrna levels of pgc1-α  and of ckmt <dig> mrna level  suggesting that these myotubes had altered substrate utilization compared to those cultivated in normal conditions. of note, rat l <dig> myotubes do not express myostatin and conversely to the other cell types, had increased level of ckmt <dig> when grown in sedm during proliferation and differentiation. for the  <dig> cell types, removal of serum evs did not affect atrogin- <dig> expression level, a muscle specific protein regulating muscle atrophy.fig.  <dig> removing evs from culture medium sera affect myoblast differentiation. a workflow showing myoblast growth conditions. cm = control media containing fbs-evs, sedm = media depleted of fbs-evs. b-c-d light-microscopy  of representative wells showing myotubes after 8 days of differentiation; b = c2c <dig>  c = l <dig> and d = human myotubes. e mean quantities of total rna/well  from the  <dig> types of myotubes after 8 days of differentiation

myoblasts grown in sedm during proliferation were switched to classical cm for differentiation . after 8 days in differentiation media, c2c <dig> and l <dig> myotubes grown in sedm_cm had higher level of myog, and c2c <dig> and human myotubes had decreased level of myostatin when compared to cells constantly grown without evs, suggesting that they had reached a higher level of differentiation. however, at the same time, c2c <dig> and human myotubes had reduced levels of atrogin- <dig> suggesting that for these  <dig> cell types, sedm_cm treatment increased myotube size without affecting the number myotubes . human myotubes expressed higher level of il- <dig> when grown in sedm_cm than in cm_cm suggesting a modification of their secretome.

l <dig> myotubes, which do not express myostatin, displayed a specific behavior. when grown in sedm_sedm or sedm_cm compared to cm_cm or cm_sedm conditions, they formed less myotubes , but these myotubes were larger  with an increase level of ckmt <dig> mrna . this result suggests that growing myoblast l <dig> in sedm during proliferation is favorable for myotube size for this cell type, conversely to c2c <dig> and human myotubes.

we also tested the reverse experiment i.e.; myoblasts grown in a cm for proliferation were switched in ev-free medium for differentiation . after 8 days in differentiation medium, c2c <dig> and l <dig> myotubes grown in cm_sedm had reduced levels of myog, pgc1-α and atrogin- <dig> suggesting that these cells were less differentiated than when grown in normal medium. compared to cells grown in normal conditions, cm_sedm treated c2c <dig> and human myotubes formed roughly the same number of myotubes as indicated by the quantity of total rna recovered in both treatments . however, this growth condition affected the number of l <dig> myotubes .

taken altogether, we concluded that growth of myoblasts in ev-free media during proliferation produces the most unfavorable situation for proper myotube formation when considering c <dig> and human myoblasts. in ev-free media, myostatin is strongly increased and dramatically affects myotubes formation and likely the expression of myomir involved in myogenesis  <cit> , at least for c2c <dig>  this situation is not reversed when the cells are switched from sedm to cm for the step of differentiation. as a consequence, proliferation in sedm affects the number of c2c <dig> and human myotubes. surprisingly, growth in ev-free media during proliferation and then switching to cm for differentiation is favorable for rat l <dig> myotube size.

bovine evs expressed mirnas involved in muscle myogenesis
myoblasts were grown either in sedm or sedm supplemented with fbs ev-derived proteins . the addition of fbs-evs induced an increase in sirt <dig> mrna level in c2c <dig> myoblasts and a decrease in the expression of myogenin both in l <dig> and c2c <dig> myoblasts . conversely, fbs-evs did not affect cyclin d <dig> and myod <dig> expressions in these  <dig> cell types, suggesting fbs-evs repress the induction of differentiation markers during proliferation. on the contrary, the addition of fbs-evs induced an increase of cyclind <dig> and myod <dig> in human primary myoblasts without affecting myogenin, suggesting that in this model, fbs-evs participate in cell cycle regulation .fig.  <dig> effect of fbs-evs on myoblasts gene expression quantified by qrt-pcr. data are expressed as fold compared to ev-depleted condition, normalized by house keeping gene . in black, cells grown in serum depleted of its evs , in grey, cells grown in sedm supplemented with fbs evs. a c2c <dig> myoblasts; b l <dig> rat myoblasts; c human primary myoblasts



taken together, these data strongly suggested that fbs-evs participated in the process of muscle cell myogenesis, and that their roles are additive to other important components of bovine serum.

as it is known that evs contain mirnas, we wondered whether fbs would contain myomir involved in muscle cell differentiation. as shown on fig.  <dig>  mir-133a and mir- <dig>  which are important for myoblast proliferation  <cit>  were detected by pcr in fbs-evs. the presence of myomir in evs of bovine serum suggested that they might be transferred in recipient myoblasts during cell culture. however, as myomirs display high evolutionary conservation in animal kingdom it was not possible to verify this hypothesis as murine, rat, human and bovine myomir sequences are identical  <cit> .fig.  <dig> fbs-evs contain mirna involved in myogenesis . data are expressed as ct values



discussion
until now, evs have been widely studied for their important roles in cancer development and immune response. this is supported by a large number of articles within the literature describing their actions on cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues and cell types. evs carry numerous protein, lipid and nucleic acid components that can collectively affect multiple signaling pathways inside recipient cells. because evs are released by all tissues, mammals have significant quantities of evs in circulating blood  <cit> . locally, we have found that skm-released evs participate in muscle homeostasis  <cit>  and we have demonstrated that myotube-released evs are involved in the process of myogenesis  <cit> , regulating myoblast proliferation. in order to isolate evs from cell culture conditioned media, it is important to remove evs from fetal bovine serum  to ensure that they are neither erroneously characterized nor competing with the experimental evs  <cit> . doing this, we have observed that c2c <dig> muscle cells constantly grown in ev-depleted fbs were unable to differentiate and stopped proliferating after 2- <dig> passages . thus, we suspected that ev-depleted fbs were important for myogenesis. in order to validate this hypothesis we have grown two myoblastic cell lines, mouse c2c <dig> and rat l <dig> and one human primary culture of myoblasts, either in normal growth conditions or in serum depleted of its evs. then we have quantified the expression of specific genes known for their important role in muscle cell proliferation , differentiation , energy metabolism  and evs secretion . the results of the present study confirm our hypothesis and demonstrate that fbs-evs participate in the process of myoblast proliferation. myoblasts grown in ev-depleted medium had affected proliferation and expressed early markers of differentiation. as a consequence, less myotubes were formed, an effect that could be partly reversed by treating cells with fbs-evs alone. surpringly, rat cell line l <dig> was positively affected and formed larger myotubes when grown in ev-depleted medium and then switch in differentiation medium containing evs, compared to normal growth condition. in fact, ev-depleted proliferation medium induced the expression of myostatin in c2c <dig> and human myotubes, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle cell size. as l <dig> cells do not expressed myostatin, induction of precoce differentiation markers during proliferation by ev-depleted medium results in large hypertrophic myotubes. thus study shows a divergence in muscle cells responses to fbs-evs depending on their origins.

while preparing this manuscript,  <dig> other similar studies were published using other cell types, which confirmed that evs in fbs support cell growth . this result was reproduced whatever the commercial source of fbs used and with different serum batches  <cit> .

the evidence that evs can enter into cells and deliver their cargo is overwhelming. most experimental evidence suggests that evs are taken up into endosomal compartments via endocytosis  <cit>  and it has clearly been demonstrated that internalized fbs-evs interact with lysosomes in the recipient cells  <cit> . as lysosomes are at the crossroads of several cellular processes such as secretion, plasma membrane repair, signaling and energy metabolism  <cit> , it is likely that internalized evs participate in various cellular pathways. however, the fbs-ev components that promote cell growth remain to be identified as evs contain a variety of cargoes that include cell surface receptors, cytosolic and nuclear proteins, metabolic enzymes, rna transcripts, mirnas and even dna, that collectively may participate in ev functions. evs also contain cellular growth factors like tgfbeta , proteins of the wnt  <cit>  and sonic hedgehog  <cit>  pathways and cytokine  <cit>  required for proliferation. all these components could participate in fbs-evs biological actions.

numerous studies have also demonstrated the transfer of mirnas from evs to recipient cells. interestingly,  <dig> mirnas involved in myogenesis are detected in fbs-evs . recently, it was demonstrated that mirnas exported in evs can be transferred between unrelated species . it is thus tempting to speculate that bovine ev-mirnas might participate in the regulation of genes involved in myogenesis in c2c <dig> recipient cells. indeed, we have found  <dig> bovine mirnas which are predicted to bind the murine myogenin 3’utr region , including mir- <dig> and mir-133a. it is tempting to speculate that bovine ev-mirnas might collectively participate in reducing the level of expression of this gene during myoblast proliferation.

it can be also envisaged that ev internalization might not always be necessary to elicit a phenotypic response by skeletal muscle cells. indeed, because of their ability to bind to plates coated with fibronectin  <cit> , evs would aid in myoblast attachment as they express integrin receptors known to mediate cell adhesion  <cit> . it would therefore be interesting to further study whether fbs-evs can be used on biomaterial surfaces as a possible strategy to improve performance of cell culture and tissue engineering.

the other important message is that removing fbs-evs from culture medium affects gene and mirna expressions and likely the proteome of the cells. numerous studies, including ours, have found that the contents of evs often contain distinguishing signatures that allow them to be traced back to their cell of origin. based on this observation, circulating evs are now considered as potential disease biomarkers. therefore a lot of proteomic and genomic analyses have been performed on evs collected from conditioned medium depleted of fbs-evs in order to have specific cell-type and tissue ev signatures . given the results of the present study, it is conceivable and likely that part of the ev signatures already published might be affected by removal of fbs-evs during ev collection.

interestingly, our data showed that we can recapitulate the cross-talk between myoblast and myotubes previously demonstrated  <cit>  by using evs from serum as well. indeed fbs-evs, as myotube-evs, can affect proliferation of myoblasts and can induce their entrance in the differentiation process. this result implies that bovine evs can transfer specific signals to cells from unrelated species  and thus that part of ev composition is evolutionarily conserved between these mammalian species. generally speaking, these results suggest that evs in body fluids could have an unsuspected function during embryogenesis and in the regulation of cellular adaptations that lead to hypertrophy, hyperplasia and metaplasia.

recently, a number of laboratories have started to develop new strategies to use evs as vehicles for dna or sirna delivery to treat various pathologies  <cit> . given the strong impact of evs on cell proliferation described previously and confirmed in this study, as well as the lack of knowledge on the ev cargoes involved in this biological action, we consider that it is important to keep in mind that evs are capable of inducing changes in recipient cells.

CONCLUSIONS
researchers studying the role of muscle evs in culture conditions should consider that depleting evs from fbs significantly alters the phenotype of muscle cells by affecting gene and mirna expressions during proliferation. further studies are now necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which evs in serum enhance cell proliferation in order to develop serum-free media that support rapid cell growth.
