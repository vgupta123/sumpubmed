BACKGROUND
tuberculosis disease  is a major global public health problem, with control becoming difficult due to increasing drug resistance and in some populations hiv co-infection  <cit> . the available vaccine, bacillus calmette–guérin , has limited efficacy and recent attempts to develop more effective protective vaccines have not been successful  <cit> . tb is caused by bacteria of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which have low overall genetic diversity and a striking clonal population structure. m. tuberculosis sensu stricto consists of seven lineages, including four that are predominant;  <dig> indo-oceanic,  <dig> east-asian including beijing,  <dig> east-african-indian,  <dig> euro-american  <cit> . these lineages are postulated to have differential impacts on pathogenesis, disease outcome and vaccine efficacy . for example, modern lineages, such as beijing and euro-american haarlem strains exhibit more virulent phenotypes compared to ancient lineages, such as east african indian <dig>  whilst some genetic differences between lineages have been identified <dig>  the molecular mechanisms responsible for differences in pathogenesis and virulence remain largely unknown  <cit> .

two groups of proteins, the pe and ppe families have been implicated in immune evasion and virulence  <cit> . members of the pe/ppe gene families are characterized by the presence of proline-glutamate  and proline-proline-glutamate  signature motifs near the n-terminus of their gene products  <cit> . the pe  and ppe  gene families constitute ~7–10 % of the coding potential of m. tuberculosis and are scattered throughout the genome  <cit> . the families can be subdivided based on similarities in their n-terminal regions  <cit> . many of the pe and ppe gene products are predicted to be localised to the cell membrane or secreted including those in the pe_pgrs domain containing subgroup and the ppe_mptr domain containing subgroup  <cit> . it has been speculated that these proteins may play a role in virulence  <cit> . pe/ppe genes are differentially expressed during infection  <cit>  and some pe/ppe proteins have been shown to elicit immune responses by the host  <cit>  and there is evidence that the pgrs domain can inhibit antigen processing  <cit> .

whilst pe_pgrs and ppe_mptr genes represent some of the most variable m. tuberculosis regions, some members of the pe/ppe family are conserved across strains and species, therefore implying different functional roles. only the protein structures of pe <dig> and ppe <dig> have been characterised  <cit> , and in lieu of experimental and functional work, insights into their function and interaction partners must come from in silico analysis of large-scale ‘omics data. however, due to the repetitive nature and high gc content genetic variation in the pe/ppe genes, it has been difficult to characterize them using traditional mapping approaches, leading to their systematic exclusion from analysis  <cit> . there have been conflicting studies reporting either high or little or no sequence divergence , but studies have been limited by the number of genes and diversity of strains analysed.

there is a need to fully characterize pe/ppe family sequence diversity across strain-types to provide better understanding of these genes and their possible role in virulence and immune evasion. the availability of high throughput short sequencing technologies has revolutionized the study of m. tuberculosis genetic diversity. in an attempt to characterize these elusive genes we have performed whole genome assembly on next generation sequence data with a high depth of coverage across the pe/ppe gene regions from  <dig> clinical and experimental isolates. these isolates represent the four major lineages, each with known informative barcoding snps  <cit> . the approach was validated by examination of  <dig> reference genomes from established databases , including  <dig> new strains with complete genomes sequenced using long read pacific bioscience  technology  <cit> .

RESULTS
assembly of m. tuberculosis genomes
conventional alignment-based analysis approaches have been of limited use in analysis of highly repetitive loci, including the pe/ppe genes. here, we de novo assembled the genomes of  <dig> samples from  <dig> different countries covering the four main lineages ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> ), with high sequence coverage in pe/ppe genes  . for each sample, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> pe/ppe genes were fully assembled and at least 90 % assembled for the remaining  <dig> genes . this level of assembly quality ensured low levels of assembly fragmentation and minimised poor gene characterization. subsequent analysis involving manual inspection or re-mapping of reads to the assemblies using reapr software, revealed all genes  to be of high quality . a further  <dig> independent complete reference genomes representing all four lineages , were aligned against h37rv to call variants, and used to further validate the results found in the assembled dataset.

variant detection and population genetic analysis
a total of  <dig>  genome-wide snps were identified by comparing the  <dig> assembled genomes to the h37rv  reference strain. of these,  <dig>   snps were located within pe/ppe regions, with greater density than the rest of the genome . in the  <dig> malawi samples, our assembly procedure revealed  <dig>  additional snp variants genome-wide  snps in  <dig> pe/ppe genes) compared to the standard approach of aligning short reads to the h3rv reference. of the  <dig>  snps inferred from the assemblies, the majority  were located in coding regions from all genes and consisted of  <dig>   non-synonymous snps and  <dig>   synonymous snps. this observation is in agreement with the higher abundance of non-synonymous mutations reported in the literature  <cit> . a large number of rare variants  were observed in all lineages, indicative of purifying selection and population expansion described by others  <cit> . the peaks in the spectrum represent a number of snps that are fixed in all isolates from sub-lineages .

the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations was similar in pe/ppe and other genes . the density of non-synonymous mutations was  <dig>  times greater in pe/ppe genes compared to others , consistent with another report  <cit> . when analysed by sub-family we observed the greatest ratio of densities in the pe_pgrs genes  compared to the other types   <dig> ), similar to that reported previously  <cit> . the nucleotide diversity  was ~2-fold greater in the pe/ppe genes . although estimates of genetic diversity may be influenced by sampling bias, nucleotide diversity varied by lineage, being greater in lineage  <dig>  and lower in lineage  <dig>  , all consistent with previous work  <cit> . loci identified as being highly diverse , included  <dig> pe/ppe genes , and  <dig> others . the diversity per gene was compared to those from  <dig> complete reference genomes, and peaks were observed at rv0095c, pe_pgrs <dig>  pe_pgrs <dig>  ppe <dig> and ppe <dig>  independently supporting five out of the eight loci identified in the  <dig> global samples .table  <dig> loci that are highly diverse, with recombination, or under selective pressure

phylogenetics
to examine the link between genetic variation and lineage, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the  <dig>  snps. it revealed clustering by lineage, thereby further validating the quality of the assembled genomes . however, a similar analysis using  <dig>  pe/ppe specific snp positions led to a tree with lineage  <dig> being split into two distinct clades, surrounded by lineage  <dig> strains . subsequent analysis using snp-based population differentiation fst and site-specific log likelihood scores approaches  revealed that the pe_pgrs <dig> gene  was predominantly responsible for the ambiguity. removal of the  <dig> snps in the pe_pgrs <dig> gene led to a pe/ppe-based tree that clustered by lineage , very similar in topology to that based on the genome-wide snps . this demonstrated that a core set of pe/ppe snps appears to be lineage specific, and further analysis revealed a set of  <dig>  snps  that were lineage specific, potentially forming the basis of a lineage-specific molecular barcode . none of these  <dig> mutations were present in m. bovis  or m. africanum  sequences, and therefore robust as m. tuberculosis lineage-specific markers. using only the pe_pgrs <dig> snps led to a tree with two large clades , one containing h37rv and strains with similar sequence, and the other consistent with isolates similar to m <dig> and 18b strains , both undergoing recent sequencing using pacbio long read technology. the m <dig>  18b and similarly clustered assembled samples have a pe_pgrs <dig> gene with conserved regions at both 3′ and 5′ ends, surrounding a highly similar hypervariable core. a different hypervariable core is present in h37rv and similarly clustered assemblies, which interestingly is also present in the pe_pgrs <dig> gene of 18b, and recombination is a potential explanation.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree constructed with snps. a

recombination detection
although it has been thought that m. tuberculosis undergoes little or no homologous recombination, pe_pgrs and ppe_mptr families contain long domains comprised of series of tandem repeats, giving them a higher propensity to undergo recombination. there is published evidence of intra-chromosomal cross-over ahead of a few loci  <cit> , including pe_pgrs <dig>  pe_pgrs <dig>  and ppe <dig>  <cit> . we hypothesized that recombination may be the reason for the observed high genetic diversity and distortion in the pe/ppe tree. we applied the pairwise homoplasy index  method  <cit>  genome-wide to establish if there was any evidence of recombination in pe_pgrs <dig> and other loci . the method calculates a p-value  of observing the sequence data under the null hypothesis of no recombination. the analysis revealed  <dig> genes with potential recombination events  present across all lineages:  <dig> in pe/ppe genes , and  <dig> others .fig.  <dig> evidence of recombination at a gene level. a manhattan plot showing genes that are likely to be recombination hotspots. the  p-value for recombination is plotted against genome position. all genes with p-values < <dig>  are labelled. genes labelled in colour grey  become statistically non-significant after removing sites under selection



it could be expected that the vast majority of any genomic recombination events are intra-lineage and that these events will pass unnoticed by other analyses, especially in studies of small sample size. lineage-specific hotspots were also present , including possible pathogenicity factors lppa/lppb in lineage  <dig>  and pe_pgrs <dig> in lineage  <dig>  an analysis of the  <dig> complete reference genomes revealed an overall high degree of concordance of the homoplasy phi statistic with the assembled data, with six recombination peaks in common  . together, these results provide evidence for recombination.

detecting selection pressure
it is possible that recombination and population expansion  <cit>  could have introduced not only the observed increased diversity in the pe/ppe genes, but contributed to an excess of non-synonymous mutation diversity in general; especially in genes expected to be under positive or diversifying selection such as the cell wall component genes  <cit> . proteins in contact with the host proteome could be under pressure to change their amino acid sequence in order to avoid detection or unfavourable interaction with the host immune system. we decided to investigate the role of selection in the pe/ppe genes compared to other categories of genes. the distribution of dn/ds values , calculated for each gene across all sites and branches of the phylogenetic tree, was similar between pe/ppe and other genes . these values are broadly similar to those previously reported on much lower numbers of samples and pe/ppe genes  <cit> . the genes were further divided into functional clusters of orthologous groups  categories  <cit> . higher median ω values were observed in genes associated with signal transduction mechanisms , perhaps due to their contact with the host, and the lowest values found in genes associated with rna processing and modification  .

in most genes it would be expected that only a small subset of sites would undergo positive selection and so calculation of a single ω value over all sites in the gene may dilute an effect. for example, this is possible in pe/ppe genes where there is less variation in the n- compared to the c- terminus  <cit> . we therefore used a likelihood ratio based approach that accounts for the variability of ω between sites. after implementation, we detected a greater proportion of pe/ppe loci under positive selection compared to other genes  vs. other genes  <dig> ). this observation remained consistent when the non-pe/ppe genes were subdivided into functional categories  . using the cog categories, the genes associated with cell motility and the pe/ppe genes again showed greater evidence of significant positive selection . all genes annotated as possible recombination hotspots were identified as being under positive selection, except rv0182c. to localize the specific polymorphisms under selection we applied the bayes empirical bayes  method  <cit> , and identified a small number of sites in each gene : pe/ppe genes  <dig> , other genes  <dig> , p =  <dig>  × 10−10). in total  <dig> pe/ppe genes had sites under positive selection, including ten genes with selection at more than ten sites . for  <dig>  non-pe/ppe genes, only  <dig> had ten or more sites under positive selection. the proportion of segregating sites under positive selection  per gene was higher in the pe/ppe loci compared to others . there was a correlation between the number of positively selected and segregating sites .fig.  <dig> evidence of positive selection between the pe/ppe and other genes by functional annotation. distributions of  p-values for positive selection  across the pe/ppe and other genes by functional annotation



we considered the  <dig>  sites in the  <dig>  non-pe/ppe genes with some evidence of positive selection . these sites were compared to a list of drug resistance-conferring mutations , which because of a survival advantage may be expected to be under positive selection. eighteen drug resistance markers were found, including in inha , katg , gyra , rpob , rpol , and pona <dig> . other regions of interest included roda  involved in cell wall processes and required for survival in primary murine macrophages, and pks <dig>  involved in lipid metabolism and in vitro growth. repeating the recombination detection analysis after removing the sites under positive selection identified by the beb method, revealed six genes that lost their statistical significance , leaving  <dig> as crossover hotspots . given that variation in these genes is not caused by positive selection it is highly likely that recombination hotspots are indeed present at these ten loci. the proportion of sites under selection was high for lppa  and lppb  loci. the beb method identified  <dig> codons in lppa/b at which ω >  <dig>  with almost all the related mutations present in lineage  <dig>  samples. none of these codons were in previously described conserved positions  <cit> , implying that the core function of the protein was not disturbed, and the mutations may contribute to antigenic variation.

selection on epitopes
epitopes potentially binding to major histocompatibility complex molecules were predicted in all pe/ppe proteins using the netmhcpan software . the number of epitopes varied by pe/ppe gene . some pe/ppe sites identified as being under selection using the beb approach did overlap with regions predicted to be epitopes. in particular, for  <dig> genes , more than 20 % of predicted epitopes had sites under positive selection .

discussion
members of the pe/ppe family of proteins have been found to trigger innate immune responses, are targets of the adaptive immune system, and potentially a rich source of diagnostic and vaccine antigens. as large ‘omic studies in m. tuberculosis have often excluded pe/ppe genes from analysis , the understanding of their function and diversity is poor compared to other loci. assessing diversity across m. tuberculosis strain types is critical, as lineages may vary in propensity to transmit and cause disease. by applying a de novo assembly approach, we were able to characterize accurately nearly all  <dig> pe/ppe genes in  <dig> isolates with high genomic coverage, representing lineages  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . after identifying ~50 k genome-wide snps from whole genome alignments, we confirmed that pe/ppe genes, especially the pe_pgrs family, have a high density of non-synonymous mutations compared to other m. tuberculosis loci. this observation is consistent with their involvement in antigenic variation and immune evasion, where proteins that are directly exposed to host immune surveillance tend to show higher levels of polymorphism. a lower degree of polymorphism in the ppe genes  is likely to reflect a strong functional constraint of the ppe proteins.

using all snps in a phylogenetic analysis, we observed clustering by m. tuberculosis lineage and therefore consistency with other published topologies  <cit> . there was evidence of lineage specific pe/ppe repertories, with a very similar phylogeny being attained by restricting analysis to all polymorphisms in  <dig> pe/ppe genes , as well as a derived subset of  <dig> informative snps. the pe_pgrs <dig> gene had high nucleotide diversity across all lineages, was not lineage informative, and is likely to be have been subject to recombination in lineages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  both m. bovis and m. canetti contain two genes annotated as orthologues of pe_pgrs <dig>  providing further evidence towards the propensity of this region to undergo genomic rearrangements. interestingly the positioning of the m. tuberculosis reference strains in the pe/ppe gene phylogenetic tree was altered; some strains clustering near the m. canetti and ancestral strains while some of the known virulent reference strains were positioned at a further distance. further study is needed to elucidate this effect. other recombination and diversity hotspots included lppb  and ppe <dig>  genes, both known to have undergone homologous recombination. lppb  are non-essential exported lipoproteins that are unique to pathogenic mycobacteria and may encode antigens  <cit> . the lppa/b snps driving this effect were found mostly in lineage  <dig>  strains, and seemed to be conferring a selective advantage. the role of lppa/b proteins on virulence should be investigated further. although, pe_pgrs <dig>  whose protein is in contact with the host immune system  <cit> , was identified as a recombination hotspot, this observation may be confounded by positive selection. however, recombination has been described in pe_pgrs <dig>  with large numbers of snps and indels in the pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig> pair observed across the different lineages, potentially arising from gene conversion events  <cit> . we can rule out the results being confounded due to a sampling frame that included different geographical regions, as there was strongest clustering by lineage and not geographical source.

across all m. tuberculosis genomes there was evidence that most genes were undergoing purifying selection pressures . however, the pe/ppe genes were most likely to be under positive selection , consistent with some pe/ppe proteins providing antigenic variation. it is possible the dn/ds ratios may be underestimated, as the methodology is more appropriate to divergent species and not for comparisons within a population  <cit> . further, the signatures from very localised regions of selection within a gene may be diluted by surrounding genetic variation. a site-specific analysis confirmed the results from the gene-based dn/ds. whilst the majority of the sixty-five genes identified as being under positive selection had only a single positively selected site, a disproportionate number of pe_pgrs genes had multiple positively selected sites. a potential limitation of this analysis is the time dependence of dn/ds for closely related bacterial genomes. this leads to possible over-estimation of the dn/ds and difficulties in interpretation when comparing the strength of selection between genes, genomes or populations over very short time-scales  <cit> . the power of the dn/ds statistic to detect positive selection is reduced when samples come from a single population  <cit> . in addition to the site under selection, multiple neighbouring and linked sites may show evidence of selection due to hitchhiking effects.

our findings provide potential insights into the use of pe/ppe proteins as vaccine components. the high levels of polymorphism observed and the lineage-specific nature in certain members of these protein families could limit their effectiveness. a pe/ppe protein that displays higher sequence conservation across many strains may be a more effective vaccine candidate. for example, the highly immunogenic pe_pgrs <dig> protein has been considered as a vaccine target  <cit> , and as only one of the  <dig> non-synonymous mutations observed was lineage specific, it may have broad strain coverage. however, one roadblock is the limited immunogenicity data available at the pe/ppe epitope level. it has been found that human t-cell epitopes are highly conserved in the m. tuberculosis complex  <cit> , and like others  <cit>  we found many epitopes predicted in pe/ppe proteins. our analysis revealed a number of pe/ppe genes with a high proportion of epitopes potentially subjected to diversifying or positive selection. as these epitopes may be used by m. tuberculosis to evade the host immune system they would be relevant for tb vaccination strategies.

a cohesive understanding of the function of the  <dig> pe/ppe family of proteins remains elusive. by analysing snp variation in  <dig> samples across the four main m. tuberculosis lineages we identified pe/ppe genes that are highly diverse, recombination hotspots and under positive selection. such analyses can assist with prioritising candidates for functional studies, potentially leading to tb control measures, such as vaccines, diagnostics and drugs.

CONCLUSIONS
human tuberculosis poses a major burden on health services worldwide. there is a need to understand the complex interactions between the human host and bacterial pathogen so that new control measures, such as vaccines and drugs, can be developed. recent technological advances have allowed large-scale studies to determine the genetic signatures of strain-types or ancestral lineages and drug resistance outcomes. despite this advance, some highly variable regions of the genome are often excluded  <cit> . this includes the pe/ppe gene family, whose members are thought to interact with the human immune system, but little is still known of their diversity and function. here we present the first comprehensive study of the genetic diversity of the  <dig> pe/ppe genes. we find most genes vary in a lineage specific manner, consistent with strain-specific repertories. however, there were exceptions to this pattern, with evidence of some genes undergoing genetic cross-over events. further, by looking for the genes under selective pressure genome-wide, we found enrichment in the number of pe/ppe genes undergoing positive selection. overall, our work highlights the importance of pe/ppe genes, describes their suitability as vaccine candidates, and provides the basis for further exploration of the proteins involved in the host immune system and pathogen interactions.
