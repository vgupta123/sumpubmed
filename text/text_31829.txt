BACKGROUND
gene transfer directly into neurons, using specific virus vectors, has potential for developing gene therapy treatments for specific neurological diseases and for studying neuronal physiology. however, due to the heterogeneous cellular composition of the brain, neuronal subtype-specific expression is required for many potential uses of neural gene transfer. the two predominate approaches are to target gene transfer to a specific cell type using a modified vector particle or to use a cell type-specific promoter to control expression  <cit> . a higher level of cell type-specific expression may be achieved by using these two complementary approaches together.

helper virus-free hsv- <dig> vectors are attractive; they efficiently transduce neurons, have a large capacity, and cause minimal cytotoxicity  <cit> . the hsv- <dig> particle is composed of four components: i) the ~ <dig> kb double stranded dna genome is contained within ii) an icosahedral protein capsid, that is surrounded by iii) the tegument, a layer of proteins, and enclosed within iv) the envelope, a lipid bilayer containing  <dig> virally-encoded glycoproteins  <cit> . hsv- <dig> infection occurrs in two stages  <cit> . the initial binding to the cell surface is mediated by specific domains on glycoprotein c  and gb that represent binding sites for glycosaminoglycans, principally heparin sulfate, present on cell surface proteoglycans  <cit> . entry requires the subsequent binding of gd to a specific receptor. gd receptors include nectin- <dig> or nectin- <dig> of the immunoglobulin superfamily; the herpesvirus entry mediator , which is a member of the tumor necrosis receptor family; and sites in heparin sulfate produced by specific isoforms of 3-o-sulfotransferases  <cit> . entry occurs by fusion of the cell membrane and the viral envelope, and requires gb, gd, gh, and gl.

targeted gene transfer with hsv- <dig> vectors was achieved by modifying gc to remove the heparin binding domain, and addition a binding site for a specific cell surface protein to either gc or gd. the initial study  <cit>  reported a recombinant virus containing a chimeric gc – erythropoietin  that supported enhanced binding to cells that contained epo receptors. analogous designs used gd – il <dig>  or gd – urokinase plaminogen activator, or gd – single-chain anti-egf receptor antibody chimeric proteins to target infection to tumor cells containing the cognate receptor  <cit> . another study  <cit>  used a hsv- <dig> plasmid  vector expressing gc – his tag, and packaging with a helper virus deleted in gc; this strategy targeted infection to a cell line containing a pseudo-his-tag receptor. all of these reports  <cit>  used specific hsv- <dig> viruses that grow productively and kill infected cells, confounding potential gene transfer studies.

we reported targeted gene transfer to a specific type of neuron in the brain  <cit> . helper virus-free packaging was performed using phsvlac  <cit>  and either gc – glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  or gc – brain-derived neurotrophic factor  chimeric protein. delivery of either vector stock into the midbrain supported  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold targeted gene transfer to nigrostriatal neurons  <cit> , which contain both the gdnf receptor α- <dig>  and the high-affinity bdnf receptor, trkb <cit> . specifically,  <dig> to 80% of the transduced cells were nigrostriatal neurons, compared to 15–30% using untargeted gene transfer; and for the untargeted expression,  <dig> to 10% was in each of gabaergic neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein-containing cells  <cit> . at times shortly after gene transfer, the hsv- <dig> immediate early  4/ <dig> promoter in phsvlac  <cit>  supports expression in most cell types, which enabled an accurate assessment of the types of transduced cells. however, phsvlac does not support significant levels of long-term expression in most neural cell types, and these rats were sacrificed at  <dig> days after gene transfer.

specific promoters support long-term expression in neurons, or specific types of neurons, from hsv- <dig> vectors. to obtain long-term, neuronal-specific expression, we constructed a chimeric promoter containing a neurofilament heavy gene  promoter, an upstream enhancer from the tyrosine hydroxylase  promoter, and a β-globin insulator . vectors containing the ins-th-nfh promoter supported expression for  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> months  <cit> , and at  <dig> months, ~ <dig>  striatal neurons contained recombinant gene products . alternatively, vectors containing the th promoter supported expression for at least  <dig> months in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, including nigrostriatal neurons . of note,  <dig> to 60% of the transduced cells were nigrostriatal neurons  <cit> , compared to 5% using phsvlac  <cit> . targeted gene transfer or use of the th promoter each supported only partial nigrostriatal-specific expression, raising the possibility that further improvements in nigrostriatal-specific expression might be obtained by combining these complementary approaches.

both to improve nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression, and to establish that targeted gene transfer can be followed by long-term expression, we performed targeted gene transfer using vectors that contain either the th or ins-th-nfh promoter. the combination of targeted gene transfer and a neuronal-specific promoter improved nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression to  <dig> to 93%. of note, the levels of expression at  <dig> month were similar to those previously observed using untargeted gene transfer with each promoter.

RESULTS
vectors containing neuronal-specific promoters can be packaged using either gc – gdnf or gc – bdnf
the combination of targeted gene transfer with vectors that contain neuronal-specific promoters may support a higher level of nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression than either approach alone. because gc – gdnf or gc – bdnf supported a similar level of targeted gene transfer to nigrostriatal neurons  at  <dig> days after gene transfer  <cit> , we decided to examine each construct. to explore the potential for targeted gene transfer to be followed by long-term expression, we decided to test two promoters that can support long-term expression in nigrostriatal neurons, the th or ins-th-nfh promoters  <cit> . we arbitrarily chose the combinations of gc – bdnf targeting with a vector containing the th promoter , or gc – gdnf targeting with a vector containing the ins-th-nfh promoter .

we quantified the additional nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression supported by the combination of targeted gene transfer using a neuronal-specific promoter by comparison to a phsvlac-type vector. at times shortly after gene transfer, phsvlac-type vectors, which contain the hsv- <dig> ie 4/ <dig> promoter, support expression in most types of neural cells. to enable comparisons within the same rats to vectors that express β-galactosidase , we used phsvpkcΔgg. phsvpkcΔgg expresses a flag-tagged catalytic domain of protein kinase c , and contains a point mutation that abolishes protein kinase activity  <cit> .

these vectors were packaged into hsv- <dig> particles for targeted gene transfer . the titers obtained for pthlac/gc – bdnf or pins-th-nfhlac/gc – gdnf were similar to the titers obtained for phsvpkcΔgg/gc – bdnf or phsvpkcΔgg/gc – gdnf , or the titers previously reported for either phsvlac/gc – bdnf or phsvlac/gc – gdnf  <cit> . we previously showed that gc – gdnf or gc – bdnf are each incorporated into hsv- <dig> virus particles  <cit> , and we did not perform analogous western blot assays in this study. for clarity of presentation, we first present results on the cell type specificity of expression supported by pthlac/gc – bdnf, followed by the cell type specificity observed using pins-th-nfhlac/gc – gdnf, and then the data on long-term expression.

in the rat brain, pthlac/gc – bdnf supported higher levels of nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression than phsvpkcΔgg/gc – bdnf
due to the small extent of the substantia nigra pars compacta  in the dorsal-ventral dimension, and the heterogeneous cellular composition of the midbrain, injections of hsv- <dig> vectors into the midbrain near the substantia nigra typically support gene transfer to different populations of cells in different rats, complicating comparisons between rats. to control for the variability in injection sites between rats, and to quantify the additional nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression supported by the th promoter after targeted gene transfer, we co-injected mixtures of equal titers of pthlac/gc – bdnf and phsvpkcΔgg/gc – bdnf . the rats were sacrificed at either  <dig> days or  <dig> month after gene transfer, the brains were sectioned, and alternating sections were costained for either β-gal-immunoreactivity  and th-ir, or flag-ir  and th-ir. nigrostriatal neurons contain th  <cit> , enabling identification using an anti-th antibody.

at  <dig> days after gene transfer, low power photomicrographs showed that most of the β-gal-ir cells were located in a narrow band that contained th-ir neurons in the snc , and a few β-gal-ir cells were located ventral to the th-ir cells. high power views showed that the clear majority of the β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir . in contrast, while many of the flag-ir cells were located within the band of th-ir cells, more of the flag-ir cells were located either dorsal or ventral to the th-ir cells . high power views showed some that flag-ir cells contained th-ir, and some flag-ir cells lacked th-ir . cell counts from  <dig> rats  showed that an average of  <dig> ± 1%  of the β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir, but only  <dig> ± 2% of the flag-ir cells also contained th-ir.

a mixture of equal ivp/ml of pthlac/gc – bdnf and phsvpkcΔgg/gc – bdnf  was injected into the midbrain proximal to the substantia nigra. the rats were perfused at  <dig> days after gene transfer, the brains were sectioned, and alternating sections were costained for either β-gal-ir or flag-ir and th-ir. sufficient sections were examined to count at least  <dig> cells that contained either β-gal-ir or flag-ir in each rat. in the sections that were examined, all of the β-gal-ir or flag-ir cells were scored for containing or lacking th-ir. for the average % costaining, the means ± sems are shown.

at  <dig> month after gene transfer, low power photomicrographs showed that almost all of the β-gal-ir cells were located within the area of th-ir neurons in the snc , and high power views showed that these β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir . in contrast, although numerous flag-ir cells were located within the band of th-ir cells, many flag-ir cells were located either dorsal or ventral to the th-ir cells , similar to the results from rats sacrificed at  <dig> days. high power views showed that some flag-ir cells contained th-ir, and some flag-ir cells lacked th-ir . cell counts from  <dig> rats  showed that an average of  <dig> ± 1% of the β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir, but only  <dig> ± 3% of the flag-ir cells also contained th-ir. statistical analysis showed that significantly more β-gal-ir than flag-ir cells contained th-ir .

this experiment was performed as in table  <dig>  except the rats were perfused at  <dig> month after gene transfer.

we previously showed that pretreatment of a phsvlac/gc – bdnf stock with an anti-bdnf antibody reduced targeted gene transfer to nigrostriatal neurons to ~16%, a level similar to that obtained using untargeted gene transfer  <cit> . analogous studies were not repeated using the current vector stocks.

pins-th-nfhlac/gc – gdnf supported higher levels of nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression than phsvpkcΔgg/gc – gdnf
we co-injected mixtures of equal titers of pins-th-nfhlac/gc – gdnf and phsvpkcΔgg/gc – gdnf into the midbrain proximal to the snc, and the rats were sacrificed at either  <dig> days or  <dig> month after gene transfer. at  <dig> days after gene transfer, low power photomicrographs showed that most of the β-gal-ir cells were located within the area of th-ir neurons , and low numbers of β-gal-ir cells were located ventral to the th-ir cells. high power views showed that most of these β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir . in contrast, many of the flag-ir cells were located within the band of th-ir cells, and many of the flag-ir cells were located ventral to the th-ir cells . consistent with the low power views, high power views showed that some flag-ir cells contained th-ir, and other flag-ir cells lacked th-ir . cell counts from  <dig> rats  showed that an average of  <dig> ± 2% of the β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir, but only  <dig> ± 2% of the flag-ir cells also contained th-ir.

this experiment was performed as in table  <dig>  except a mixture of equal titers of pins-th-nfhlac/gc – gdnf and phsvpkcΔgg/gc – gdnf was injected into the midbrain.

at  <dig> month after gene transfer, low power photomicrographs showed that the area of β-gal-ir cells closely followed the area of th-ir neurons in the snc , and high power views showed that these β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir . in contrast, many flag-ir cells were located within the band of th-ir cells, and some flag-ir cells were located either dorsal or ventral to the th-ir cells . high power views showed flag-ir cells that either contained or lacked th-ir . cell counts from  <dig> rats  showed that an average of  <dig> ± 0% of the β-gal-ir cells also contained th-ir, but only  <dig> ± 5% of the flag-ir cells also contained th-ir. statistical analysis showed that significantly more β-gal-ir than flag-ir cells contained th-ir .

this experiment was performed as in table  <dig>  except a mixture of equal titers of pins-th-nfhlac/gc – gdnf and phsvpkcΔgg/gc – gdnf was injected into the midbrain, and the rats were perfused at  <dig> month after gene transfer.

following targeted gene transfer, pthlac or pins-th-nfhlac supported long-term expression
the cell counts in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were used to calculate the total numbers of β-gal-ir cells supported by each vector, at either  <dig> days or  <dig> month after gene transfer. the results  showed that the ins-th-nfh or th promoter each supported 37% of the number of cells at  <dig> month compared to  <dig> days. this 37% stability of long-term expression is similar the stabilities of expression observed following standard, untargeted gene transfer using either pthlac  <cit>  or pins-th-nfhlac  <cit> . surprisingly, the ie 4/ <dig> promoter supported  <dig> to 28% stability of expression in nigrostriatal neurons. in contrast, using untargeted gene transfer, phsvlac supports ≤ 1% stability of expression at  <dig> month in the striatum, hippocampus, or specific neocortical areas  <cit> . congruently, transgenic mice that contain specific hsv- <dig> ie promoters controlling a reporter gene showed that specific ie promoters support expression in only a few specific types of neurons  <cit> . thus, the ie 4/ <dig> promoter in phsvlac-type vectors appears to selectively support higher levels of long-term expression in nigrostriatal neurons than in most other types of neurons, including those in the midbrain, striatum, or hippocampus  <cit> .

using pthlac & phsvpkcΔgg,  <dig> rats were analyzed at  <dig> days, and  <dig> rats were analyzed at  <dig> month. using pins-th-nfhlac & phsvpkcΔgg,  <dig> rats were analyzed each time point. the means ± sems are shown.

discussion
the combination of targeted gene transfer with a vector that contains a neuronal-specific promoter improved nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression, compared to either approach alone. untargeted gene transfer with phsvlac-type vectors supported  <dig> to 30% nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression  <cit> ; phsvlac-type vectors contain the hsv- <dig> ie 4/ <dig> promoter that is active in multiple types of neural cells at times shortly after gene transfer. pthlac, with standard untargeted gene transfer, supported  <dig> to 60% nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression  <cit> . targeted gene transfer with phsvlac-type vectors supported  <dig> to 80% nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression . targeted gene transfer with vectors containing the th or ins-th-nfh promoter supported  <dig> or 84% nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression at  <dig> days after gene transfer, and  <dig> or 93% nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression at  <dig> month after gene transfer. the ~10% increase in nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression between  <dig> days and  <dig> month after gene transfer may be due to a higher level of inappropriate expression from the neuronal-specific promoter at  <dig> days, before chromatin structure on the vectors has reached steady levels.

targeted gene transfer with each of the neuronal-specific promoters supported similar levels of nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression, although the th promoter is specific for nigrostriatal neurons while the ins-th-nfh promoter is active in most types of neurons. using targeted gene transfer with phsvlac-type vectors, we showed that ~5% of the gene transfer was to glutamic acid decarboxylase -ir neurons and  <cit> , and gabaergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata are adjacent to the snc. also, using targeted gene transfer with phsvlac-type vectors, we showed that  <dig> to 12% of the gene transfer was to glial fibrillary acidic protein -ir cells  <cit> , and we did not examine gene transfer to other types of glia. thus, inappropriate gene transfer to glla appears to account for more of the inappropriate gene transfer than gene transfer to other types of neurons, and both the th and ins-th-nfh promoters are neuronal-specific promoters that will reduce the inappropriate expression in glia.

targeted gene transfer with either gc – gndf or gc – bdnf was not complete, and some gene transfer to inappropriate cell types was observed . the fragment of gc in either gc – gdnf or gc – bdnf lacks the heparin sulfate binding domain  <cit> ; but the vector particles still contain gb, which contains a heparin sulfate binding domain  <cit> . in the context of hsv- <dig> viruses, deletion of either the gc or gb heparin sulfate binding domain reduced binding to fibroblast cells ~65% or ~20%, respectively, and deletion of both domains was approximately additive, reducing binding ~80%  <cit> . thus, use of both a gb lacking a heparin sulfate binding domain  and a chimeric gc might improve targeted gene transfer to nigrostriatal neurons.

using phsvlac-type vectors, gc – gndf or gc – bdnf appear to support similar levels of targeted gene transfer ; although over  <dig> rats have been analyzed, these are comparisons between different rats that do not control for variability in injection sites between rats. the untargeted gene transfer supported by the wt gb in these vector particles may be a larger variable than any differences in targeting efficiency between gc – gndf or gc – bdnf. of note, gdnf is more effective than bdnf in protecting nigrostriatal neurons in the 6-ohda rat model of parkinson's disease  <cit> . however, neuroprotection requires intracellular signaling, whereas targeted gene transfer requires only binding of the vector particle to the appropriate receptor on the cell surface. as nigrostriatal neurons contain high levels of both the gdnf receptor α- <dig>  and the high-affinity bdnf receptor, trkb  <cit> , gc – gndf or gc – bdnf may support similar efficiencies of targeted gene transfer to nigrostriatal neurons.

following targeted gene transfer, the th or ins-th-nfh promoters supported levels of long-term expression that were similar to those observed following untargeted, standard gene transfer. gc – gndf or gc – bdnf likely alter only the initial binding to cells, after the initial binding to cells, entry occurs by fusion of the cell membrane and the viral envelope, and requires gb, gd, gh, and gl. thus, using either targeted gene transfer or standard gene transfer, entry, vector particle uncoating, and gene expression are likely to occur by similar pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
our results establish that following targeted gene transfer, specific promoters can support long-term expression from hsv- <dig> vectors. targeted gene transfer to nigrostriatal neurons, followed by long-term expression, may be useful for specific gene therapy treatments or physiological studies. in relation to parkinson's disease, clinical trials with recombinant gdnf protein were halted due to side effects  <cit> , suggesting that more restricted expression of gdnf is desirable. in relation to studies on neuronal physiology, transgenic mice that use the th promoter to control recombinant gene expression will alter expression in most catecholaminergic neurons, whereas the approach described here can support a selective analysis of nigrostriatal neuron physiology. more generally, targeted gene transfer followed by long-term expression may have specific clinical or basic neuroscience applications in brain areas that contain a complex mixture of different types of neurons, including the midbrain, and possibly also specific forebrain areas.
