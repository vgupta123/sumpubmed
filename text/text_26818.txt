BACKGROUND
nowadays, the central dogma of molecular biology —developed from classic research works aimed at determining the biology of prokaryotic organisms— is known to reflect only a part of the agenda containing the genetic information that gives rise to the complexity of eukaryotic organisms. the characterization of post-transcriptional events leading to the generation of multiple rnas, proteins and functions from only one rna precursor shows up the existence of multiple overlapping regulatory networks and mechanisms for the control of biological functions beyond transcriptional regulation. there is increasing evidence to support the idea that transcriptome and proteome regulation and heterogeneity are key stages to understand differences in the protein diversity observed in organisms of similar genetic complexity. it’s therefore necessary to fully characterize the modulators linking and synchronizing multiple layers of gene expression regulation.

t-cell intracellular antigen  <dig>  and tia <dig> related/like  proteins are two dna/rna binding proteins that regulate many aspects of rna metabolism at different levels. these multifunctional regulators can modulate: i) dna-dependent transcription through its interaction with dna and rna polymerase ii  <cit> ; ii) alternative splicing of pre-mrna through the selection of atypical 5′ spliced sites  <cit> , and iii) stability and/or translation of eukaryotic mrnas through the interaction with 5′ and/or 3′ untranslatable regions  <cit> . some of these regulatory layers operate in the control of main biological programmes so as to maintain cellular homeostasis; this programmes include apoptosis, inflammation, cell responses to stress or viral infections . furthermore, mice lacking either tia <dig>  <cit>  or tiar  <cit> , as well as ectopically over-expressing tiar  <cit> , show higher rates of embryonic lethality.

micrornas  are a class of 19- <dig> nt long non-coding rnas that regulate post-transcriptionally gene expression by binding with partially complementary sequences on target mrnas and inhibiting translation or affecting stability of these mrnas  <cit> . multiple lines of evidence indicate that they are key regulators of numerous critical functions in developmental, cell differentiation and disease processes, including tumorigenesis and cancer progression  <cit> . however, defining the place and function of mirnas in complex regulatory networks is not straightforward. systems’ approaches such as the inference of a module network from expression data can help to achieve this goal  <cit> .

we have previously described specific changes of transcriptomic dynamics associated to inflammation, angiogenesis, metabolism, and cell proliferation-related genes upon tia1/tiar-rna interference-based silencing in hela cells  <cit> . in the present study, we test the hypothesis whether there are specific changes associated to the pattern of mirna expression which may interfere/modulate with target genes and, therefore, contribute to the phenotypes described in tia-depleted hela cells. herein, we identified a mirna signature that is concomitant and coherent with biological processes and pathways associated to the phenotypes observed in hela cells lacking tia proteins.

methods
cell culture and rna interference analysis
hela cells were grown and transfected with  <dig> nm of either a control sirna  or two sirnas against tia <dig>  and tiar  directed to the positions 59-81/647- <dig> and 65-87/971- <dig> to the coding regions of tia <dig> and tiar mrnas, respectively, as described previously  <cit> .

cell extract preparation, western blot analysis and rna purification
whole-cell extracts were prepared by resuspensing the cells in lysis buffer , freeze-thawing three times, and centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min. in a microfuge at 4°c. resulting supernatants were recovered and stored at -70°c  <cit> . immunoblots were carried out loading equal amounts of protein  on 10% sds-page and using the following antibodies: anti-tia <dig> and anti-tiar from santa cruz biotechnology  and anti-α-tubulin from sigma . rna was extracted by using a mirvana kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

microrna expression profiling analysis
the quality of the total rna was verified by an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer profile.  <dig> ng total rna from each sample was labeled with hy3™ or hy5™ fluorescent label, using the mircury lna™ microrna labeling kit hy3™/hy5™ , following the procedure described by the manufacturer. a hy3™- and a hy5™-labeled rna sample were mixed pair-wise and hybridized to the mircury lna™ microrna array , which contains capture probes targeting all micrornas for human registered in the mirbase version  <dig> . the hybridization was performed according to the mircury lna™ microrna array instruction manual using a tecan hs4800™ hybridization station . after hybridization the microarray slides were scanned and stored in an ozone free environment  in order to prevent potential bleaching of the fluorescent dyes. the mircury lna™ microrna array slides were scanned using the agilent g2565ba microarray scanner system  and the image analysis was carried out using the imagene®  <dig>  . the quantified signals were background corrected  and normalized using the global lowess  regression algorithm.

local background was corrected by normexp method with an offset of  <dig>  background corrected intensities were transformed to log scale  and normalized by lowess for each array  <cit> . finally, to have similar intensity distribution across all arrays, lowess-normalized-intensity values were scaled by adjusting their quantiles  <cit> . after data processing each probe was tested for changes in expression over replicates using an empirical bayes moderated t statistic  <cit> . to control the false discovery rate , p values were corrected using the method of benjamini and hochberg   <cit> . fiesta viewer  was used to visualize all microarray results and to evaluate the numerical thresholds  applied for selecting differentially expressed genes  <cit> .

the mirplus sequences are licensed human sequences . some of them are already annotated in the mirbase database version  <dig>  microarray data discussed in this publication have been deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus database  and are accessible through the geo series accession number gse <dig> 

qpcr
the method was optimized for microrna, and reagents, primers, and probes were obtained from applied biosystems. reverse transcriptase  reactions and real-time pcr  were performed according to manufacturer protocols at the genomic pcr core facility at universidad autónoma de madrid in madrid scientific park. analyses were performed in two independent samples by triplicate, including no-template and rt-minus controls. u <dig> rna and mir- <dig> expression were used as endogenous reference controls. relative mirna expression was calculated using the comparative cycle threshold method.

generation of mirna targets dataset
in silico targets predicted for each of the differentially expressed mirnas by three different algorithms: targetscan  <dig>  , pictar-vert  and mirdb  <cit>  were downloaded using web-app mirbase  <cit>  . given that each algorithm focus on different aspects of mirna-mrna pairing, and the lack of experimental validation of most mirnas targets do not allow a false-positive elimination, we kept the datasets by considering the following score values: targetscan  <dig>  , pictar-vert  and mirbd .

gene ontology, pathway and network analyses
the gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database analysis were conducted using software programmes provided by gencodis <dig>   <cit> . networks and regulatory topologies of functional relationships between gene clusters were created using the cytoscape  <cit>  .

RESULTS
to analyze the putative role of tia proteins in the control of gene expression on micrornas, we transfected hela cells with double-stranded small interfering rnas  targeting tia <dig> and tiar mrnas or with control sirna , as previously reported  <cit> . the effect of sirnas on tia1/tiar expression was analyzed by western blotting . upon tia1/tiar-rna interference-based silencing, 80-90% and 70-80% depletions of tia <dig> and tiar proteins, respectively  were achieved  <dig> h after transfection, thus in agreement with previous observations  <cit> . by contrast, α-tubulin protein  was used as control of sirna specificity, and its expression level was not significantly affected by gene interference approach.

to test the microrna  expression profiles resulting from the reduction of tia <dig> and tiar protein levels, the differences in global mirna expression patterns in control and tia1/tiar-depleted hela cells were determined by means of a mircury™ lna array with specific probes for simultaneous analysis of at least  <dig> different mirnas. after having passed sample qc on the bioanalyzer <dig> and rna measurement on the nanodrop instrument, the samples were labelled using the mircury™ hy3™/hy5™ labelling kit and hybridized on the mircury™ lna array  . analysis of the scanned slides showed that the labelling was successful as all capture probes for the control spike-in oligo nucleotides produced signals in the expected range. the quantified signals were normalized using the global lowess  regression algorithm, which we have found produces the best within-slide normalization to minimize the intensity-dependent differences between the dyes . the positive effect of this normalization is illustrated in  <dig> different plots for each experimental conditions analyzed . it is interesting to note the high reproducibility of individual mirna expression levels and their correlation across the different mirna pools . on the other hand, an appropriate statistical test analysis was made using a linear model  to compare mirna expression patterns for three two-color arrays performed from three independent biological replicates .

as shown in table  <dig>  depletion of tia-proteins resulted in significantly altered mirna expression profiling. the expression level of  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas was found to more than double when comparing channels hy <dig> and hy <dig>  the genome-wide profiling analysis identified  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> putative in-silico mirnas . these were the well-established mirnas: mir-197-3p, mir- <dig>  mir-373-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-503-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-615-3p, mir- <dig>  mir-625-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-663a, mir-671-5p and mir-769-3p, which were differentially up-regulated at least 2-fold . the identified mirplus sequences were in licensed human sequences; now a great number of these sequences have been annotated in the corresponding mirna database. this information is available in table  <dig>  regarding the differentially expressed mirplus in our experimental conditions, an update of these mirplus sequences in the mirbase  <dig> indicates that mirplus- <dig> is mir-30b-3p, mirplus- <dig> is mir-744-5p, mirplus- <dig> is mir-203a, mirplus- <dig> and mirplus- <dig> are mir-483-5p, mirplus- <dig> is mir-193a-5p, mirplus- <dig> is mir-125a-3p, mirplus- <dig> is mir-371-5p and mirplus- <dig> is mir-629-5p . the remaining mirplus sequences have not been yet assigned to the putative specific mirnas .

mirna cluster defining a signature of up-regulated mirnas in tia-depleted hela cells. the microarray data were analyzed by the limma r method. fold is an average measure of the fold change in differential expression and the false discovery rate  indicates the expected percentage of false positives . mirna id update are mirnas and mirplus renamed in agreement with mirbase  <dig> database. n.d. means non-determined.

to validate previous results on identified mirnas and their relative expression levels, four up-regulated and two unchanged mirnas were confirmed by taqman reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction  analyses. as shown in figure  <dig>  the results obtained by quantitative amplification were fully comparable and the relative fold changes in mirna expression were consistent with the data detected by hybridization in the corresponding microarrays .

as a first attempt to understand the relevance of  <dig> differentially up-regulated mirnas, in silico methods for predicting human mirna target genes were used . the potential target genes were identified by searching the targetscan, pictar and mirbd databases  <cit> . by comparing and selecting alone non-repeated target genes,  <dig> mirna target genes were identified . all these potential target genes were tested using computer tool genecodis <dig>  <cit>  to elucidate the biological processes and cellular pathways assigned using gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database analyses . a total of  <dig> biological processes from go database and  <dig> cellular pathways from kegg categories were estimated with a significance hypergeometric test . target genes corresponding to the biological processes from go categories were mainly involved in regulation of dna-dependent transcription, signal transduction, multicellular organismal development, positive/negative regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter, cell adhesion, transmembrane transport, apoptotic process and nervous system development . in addition, target genes associated to the main biological pathways were also identified using kegg database involving pathways in cancer, mapk signalling pathway, focal adhesion, endocytosis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, wnt signalling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, glutamatergic synapse, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and tuberculosis . collectively, these results suggest that tia-protein depletion promotes the induction of a mirna signature which may directly and indirectly contribute to the establishment of the observed cellular phenotypes in tia-deficient hela cells  <cit> .


gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  databases analysis were carried out using genecodis <dig> software. the categories were ranked on their numbers of associated genes and the ten with the highest number of genes are shown.

on the other hand, the collection of differentially expressed genes previously identified by expression microarray human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>   in tia-depleted hela cells  <cit>  were intersected with potential target genes identified using in silico target prediction tools. the results show that only  <dig> out of  <dig>  up- and  <dig> out of  <dig>  down-regulated genes were shared . go and kegg database analyses were independently performed for up- and down-regulated genes with genecodis <dig> software. the results suggest that the enrichment functional categories  are related with signal transduction, innate immune response and response to interleukin- <dig> for up-regulated genes and glomerular basement membrane development for down-regulated genes. further, cellular pathways of neuroactive lingand-receptor interaction and apoptosis were associated to up-regulated genes, whereas endocytosis and lysosomes were linked to down-regulated genes . taken together, these results suggest that at least a fraction  of the up-regulated mirnas  could be contributing to the establishment of differential expression profiles associated to the hela cells lacking tia proteins.

based on above observations an interesting question emerges: why should many specific genes be up- or down-regulated by induced mirnas in tia-depleted hela cells? a simple answer to this question might be that these mrnas or their precursors  are targeted by tia proteins through one or multiple layers to exert the control of their gene expression; thus, these regulators can act as multifunctional rna binding proteins . to approach this issue, the experimental profiles of the binding patterns of tia proteins  at the up- or down-regulated pre-mrnas  were examined using the iclip database of tia proteins kindly provided by jernej ule’s laboratory  <cit> . for example, as shown in figure  <dig> and in table  <dig>  the pre-mrnas analyzed show multiple sequence sites located across the full-length pre-mrnas, both exons and introns, and which we have classified as genes with either low , medium  or high  density of tia binding sites. the greatest relevance of this observation is the fact that the density of binding sites on these pre-mrnas is found in both up- and down-regulated genes and located with frequency on the last exons of these pre-mrnas and particularly on the sequences located at the 3′ untranslated regions of the mature mrnas. in this regard, it is reasonable to think that the existence of a feedback loop that represses the expression of many genes, which could be activated in the absence of tia proteins, for example at the post-transcriptional levels , to dampen its expression in order to promote or counteract the cellular phenotypes associated to the absence of the tia proteins.

during the last decade, much progress has been made in the understanding of network topology and the relevance and properties of its basic modules. in this study, we analyze and assess module networks inferred from both mirnas and gene expression data using a bioinformatic tool as cytoscape  <cit> . by matching expressed mirnas and experimentally defined up- and down-regulated genes in tia-depleted hela cells, a putative regulatory network of tia-associated genes and mirnas was constructed. based on the number of potential gene interactions with single mirnas, both up- and down-expressed genes regulating tia-mediated differential expression were connected . this network draws a cellular scenario where the reduction of tia proteins could lead to molecular responses mediated by individual mirnas. such a computational approach, starting from expression data alone, can be helpful in the future process of identification of the function of these mirnas by suggesting modules of co-expressed genes in which they could play a regulatory role.

discussion
current data suggest that a significant portion of the information containing the human genome is regulated by mirnas. these small rnas recognize and regulate target genes. in this regard, more than 60% of protein-coding genes are predicted in silico as targets, based on conserved base-pairing between the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions  of the mrna and the seed sequence of the mirnas  <cit>  without considering putative target on coding sequences. at present, near to  <dig>  mirnas have been identified in the human genome and about 20-30% of human genes are controlled by one or more mirnas  <cit> . multiple lines of evidence indicate that they are key regulators of numerous critical functions in development and disease, including cancer. many of them have been reported to have molecular features and act either as tumour suppressors or oncogenes  <cit> . the changes in mirna signature identified in this study might directly and indirectly function as encouraging/counteracting mechanism of biological processes and cellular pathways to promote/attenuate the inflammatory, angiogenic and proliferative responses linked to tia-depleted hela cells  <cit> .

given that many target genes associated with the identified up-regulated mirnas are down-regulated  in tia-depleted hela cells  <cit> , from a mechanistic viewpoint our results indicate that mrna abundance in most targeted genes was somewhat affected by mirnas, thus suggesting that, for a substantial number of genes regulated by tia-protein absence, destabilization of mrna may be the main mechanism of protein repression by these mirna-mediated regulators. this observation agrees with a recent study, suggesting that mammalian mirnas predominantly reduce target mrna levels  <cit> . however, some mirnas such as mir- <dig> enhances cyclin b <dig> mrna expression through a novel mechanism. mirna positively-regulates gene expression by targeting promoter elements; this phenomenon is known as rna activation  <cit> . in this regard, it is reasonable to think that this mechanism could be operating in the up-regulation observed for seven target genes associated with the up-regulated mirnas . furthermore, mirnas do not only regulate the expression of protein-encoding genes but also other mirnas: for instance, let-7a controls the expression of important epigenetic regulators, including epigenetic mirna regulatory circuits, and organizes the whole gene expression profile  <cit> . on the other hand, there are mirna-target interactions that involve multiple sites for a given target and confer much stronger repression. more often, different mirnas work together to co-target a given mrna, therefore their combined repressive effect greatly exceeds the individual contributions  <cit> . both regulatory situations are observed in the down-regulated genes associated to up-regulated mirnas in tia-depleted hela cells . this suggests that clusters of mirnas can play a more prominent role than only reinforcing the expression patterns dictated by transcriptome dynamics. the existence of interactions among these regulators and the interactions between their regulatees suggests that these mirnas generate networks that modulate antagonistic cellular responses, such as apoptosis or cell proliferation induction and/or repression. our set of data indicates that the action of mirnas could potentially be another important mechanism in the regulation of gene expression and some gene regulatory networks mediated by tia proteins. these observations thus suggest the existence of feedback mechanisms that promote mirna expression, which might therefore contribute to dampen the phenotypes observed in tia-lacking hela cells. a type  <dig> incoherent feedforward loop  <cit>  may contribute to the repression model between tia proteins, target genes and associated mirnas. this feedforward loop could reinforce the functional role of tia proteins as repressors of inflammatory, angiogenic, and proliferative responses .

regarding some mirnas identified in this study, these could be related to mirna-mediated gene expression fluctuations and, more faithfully, to signal outcomes in the context of specific regulatory networks. this suggest that mirnas can strenghten transcriptome patterns by buffering the deleterious effects of some network states linked to random fluctuations in gene expression program, in agreement with previous findings  <cit> . since little experimental information is available on potential target genes and mirna cluster identified in our study and we have not experimentally carried out analysis of gain- and loss-of function, we used experimental data on mirna function to understand the potential implication and relevance of these mirnas in the development and progression of -physiological conditions. for example, mirna-30b has been implicated in angiogenesis  <cit> , trail-induced apoptosis in glioma cells  <cit>  and oral squamous cell cancers  <cit> . mir-193a-5p targets yy1-apc regulatory axis in human endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma  <cit> . mir- <dig> participates in a regulatory network that modulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition  <cit>  as well as to promote suppression immune  <cit> . mir- <dig> is induced under hypoxia and works as a iron sensor to stimulate cell proliferation and promote cell survival in the hypoxic region within tumor  <cit> . further, this mirna modulates the mitochondrial functioning and metabolism  <cit> , represses fgfrl <dig> and e2f <dig> expression, which inhibits cell apoptosis in hypoxia response  <cit> , predicts poor survival in patients with breast cancer  <cit>  and activates notch signalling pathway in angiogenesis  <cit> . in addition, mir-371-5p is increased in gastric cancer  <cit>  and mir- <dig> functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma given that is a new regulator of protein phosphatase  <dig>  <cit> , an repressor of the large tumor suppressor homolog  <dig>  <cit>  and promotes tumor invasion and metastasis in testis cancer  <cit> . further, both mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> participate in the gene expression control of dna repair in hypoxic stress  <cit> . mirna- <dig> and mirna- <dig> are highly expressed and regulate metastatic functions in hepatoblastoma, rectal cancer, adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma  <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> is induced in angiogenesis, down-regulates cugbp <dig> and modulates metastatic function in hepatocellular cancer cell  <cit> . mirna- <dig> has been involved in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia via targeting anti-apoptotic genes  <cit> . mirna- <dig> is up-regulated in colorectal cancer  <cit> . mirna-615-3p dysregulates cdkn2a, nf <dig> and jun in malignant mesothelioma  <cit>  and enhances the phagocytic capacity of splenic macrophages  <cit> . mirna- <dig> promotes invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by targeting ilk  <cit> . mir- <dig> is associated to lung cancer by targeting nbs <dig>  <cit> . mirna- <dig> and mir- <dig> are up-regulated in cell transformation and human gastric cancer  <cit> . in addition, other mirnas show a great potential as activators of cell proliferation/transformation phenotypes; for example mirna- <dig> functions as an oncogene promoting tumorigenesis by targeting p <dig>  vegf, junb, jund and tgfb <dig> genes  <cit>  and plays also a role in inflammatory response of endothelial cells  <cit> . mirna  <dig> regulates cd <dig> inducing metastasis by regulating extracellular matrix functions  <cit>  as well as mirna-dependent gene silencing involving ago2-mediated cleavage of a circular antisense rna  <cit> . mirna- <dig> up-regulates cyclin b <dig> expression  <cit>  and down-regulates transforming growth factor beta- <dig> expression  <cit> . on the other hand, other mirnas identified in our study have bipolar features and putatively antagonistic behaviours as opposite regulators acting either positively or negatively under specific biological programmes. in this regards, there are at least  <dig> mirnas showing functions to repress proliferation, angiogenesis and transformation phenotypes. this is the case of mirna-483-5p, which suppresses the proliferation of glioma cells via directly targeting erk <dig>  <cit>  and angiogenesis in vitro by targeting serum response factor  <cit> . however, microrna-483-5p and mirna- <dig> have been identified as predictors of poor prognosis in adrenocortical cancer  <cit> . mir-125a-3p is down-regulated in non-small cell lung cancer, having inverse effects on invasion and migration of lung cancer cells  <cit> . this mirna is a potent prognostic marker in gastric cancer  <cit> . collectively, the mirna expression profiling identified in this study has important aftermath in tumorigenesis and could contribute/repress to the development of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, transformation phenotypes, because individual mirnas are associated with diagnosis, prognosis and treatment efficacy linked to the biology of human tumors. therefore, these mirnas can target to oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes  and take part in the promotion or inhibition of tumorigenesis and cancer progression, thus being able to confer robustness to these pathological phenotypes.

in summary, our findings suggest that expression changes in individual mirnas in tia-depleted hela cells could directly or indirectly impact on biological processes and signaling pathways to favour cell phenotypes associated to the down-regulation of tia proteins . further, our observations suggest that some of the identified mirnas are consistent with an adaptive response aimed at attenuating the inflammatory, angiogenic, and proliferative responses developed in tia-protein absence. therefore, cross talk between regulatory mechanisms that promote increased/reduced expression of mirna-mediated genes may contribute to modify the relative expression levels of the mrnas associated with tia-lacking hela cells. based on this integrative analysis, our results provide a prominent stand for future approaches aimed at characterizing the role of specific mirnas in tia-mediated gene expression regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression profiling approaches have improved our understanding on how the human transcriptome dynamics orchestrates global responses at molecular level to answer to changing environmental challenges. our study identifies a human mirna collection that displays significant changes in the transient absence of tia proteins in hela cells. the most prominent changes are linked to the up-regulation of mir-30b-3p, mir125a-3p, mir-193a-5p, mir-197-3p, mir-203a, mir- <dig>  mir-371-5p, mir-373-5p, mir-483-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-503-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-615-3p, mir- <dig>  mir-625-5p, mir-629-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-663a, mir-671-5p, mir-769-3p and mir-744-5p. the integration of the identified mirnas with the potential target genes and previous gene expression data under the same experimental conditions revealed enrichment of biological processes and signaling pathways controlling relevant members of the pathways associated to the oncogenesis. down-regulation of these cellular components may contribute to establish the inflammatory, angiogenic, and proliferative responses previously described in tia protein-lacking hela cells. therefore, our results are consistent with the existence of regulatory networks that generate correlated expressions, commonly involving mirnas  <cit> . this regulatory architecture may increase the fidelity of inhibition of the downstream components by acting on them redundantly. in other words, a transient loss of tia proteins can be partially compensated for by the adaptive presence of specific mirnas. collectively, these findings suggest that tia proteins can act as multifunctional regulators to provide a novel meeting point between the mechanisms for cross-talking among concerted post-transcriptional regulatory layers that coordinate complex cellular responses.
