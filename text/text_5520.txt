BACKGROUND
the genus valeriana, containing over  <dig> species grown in europe, britain, and asia  <cit> . the roots of valeriana plants are used mainly for medicinal purposes. the roots have been known to contain several photochemical constituents with pharmacological properties including hypnotic, sedative, antispasmodic, mild anodyne, hypotensive and carminative effects  <cit> . among them, valeriana fauriei, which is found widely in the northeast of china, south korea, and japan, has been used in folks for hundreds of years   <cit> . researchers have isolated more than  <dig> compounds from valeriana plants, such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, iridoids, alkaloids, and so on  <cit> . it has been reported that flavonoids and alkaloids are primarily observed in the aerial parts and sesquiterpenes and iridoids noticed in rhizomes and roots  <cit> . among these constituents, valerenic acid is responsible for the sedative effects and its derivatives are produced in roots and rhizomes as principal compounds of valeriana species  <cit> .fig.  <dig> photograph of 2-month-old seedling of v. fauriei




terpenes, one of the major secondary metabolites in medicinal plants, have many volatile representatives such as isoprenes , monoterpenes , sesquiterpenes , even some diterpenes , and triterepenes   <cit> . members of this family serve many important functions like protecting the plants from many insects, pest, herbivores and microbial pathogens such as bacteria and fungi  <cit> . all terpenes are assembled from the basic unit of isoprenes, isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate . these universal five carbon precursors are derived from two alternate biosynthetic pathways: mevalonate  pathway from acetyl-coa and the 2-c-methylerythritol 4-phosphate  pathway from glycerol and pyruvate   <cit> . recent report claimed that even though the operation of this pathway is independent, some metabolic connection were observed between the two pathways  <cit> .

the mva pathway initiates with the formation of acetoacetyl-coa by acetocetyl-coa thiolase . the hmg-coa synthase  catalyzes the synthesis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa with one acetyl-coa and one acetoacetyl-coa. next, hmg-coa reductase  synthesizes the mva. further, enzymes such as mevalonate kinase , phosphomevalonate kinase , and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase  catalyze the formation of ipp. the first step in mep pathway, pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate combined and produce 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate by doxp synthase  which is mainly observed in plastids. then, the conversion of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate to 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate is carried out by doxp reductoisomerase . mep is transformed into 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2--butenyl 4-phosphate by the action of various catalytic enzymes. enzyme -4-hydroxy-3-methylbut 2-enyl diphosphate reductase  catalyzes the synthesis of ipp and dmapp  <cit> . ipp and dmapp are formed by the action of enzymes geranyl diphosphate synthase  and farnesyl diphosphate synthase , respectively  <cit> . ipp and dmapp are the backbone for the synthesis of all terpenes.

carotenoids, the natural c <dig> isoprenoid products, are essential hydrophobic plant compounds which contribute to yellow, orange or red color  <cit> . carotenoids play an important role in photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis, and photoprotection. it is also mainly involved in the production of abscisic acid. the main carotenoid biosynthetic pathway was identified in many plants and studied extensively. the pathway begins with condensation of  <dig> molecules of geranyl-geranylpyrophosphate, a precursors from the upstream mep pathway for production of 15-cis-phytoene catalyzed by phytoene synthase    <cit> . then, 15-cis-phytoene is converted to lycopene, the first yellow carotenoid, through desaturation reactions which are synthesized by both phytoene desaturase  and ζ-carotene desaturase   <cit> . poly-cis lycopene to trans-lycopene is produced by the action of carotenoid isomerase   <cit> . next, carotenoid biosynthesis is branched to produce α- and β-carotene by enzymatic catalytic activity of two lycopene cyclases, lycopene β-cyclase  and lycopene ε-cyclase   <cit> . α-carotene is hydroxylated into lutein by both β-ring hydroxylase  and ε-ring hydroxylase . in the other bransch, β-carotene is transformed into zeaxanthin; process is catalyzed by chxb. next, zeaxanthin epoxidase  allows synthesis of violaxanthin from zeaxanthin. at last, the enzymatic activity of nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases  is responsible for the synthesis of abscisic acid as the final product  <cit> . along the pathway, the oxidative activity of the specific enzymes generate apocarotenoids which is further degraded by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases   <cit> .

phenolic compounds, widely distributed in higher plants, belong to one of the major classes of secondary metabolites including lignins, flavonols, isoflavonoids and anthocyanins  <cit> . these compounds contribute many important functional aspects of plant life such as uv sunscreens, pigments signaling. additionally, accumulation of phenolic compounds is stimulated by biotic and abiotic responses. currently, many researchers have been focused on the improvement of phenolic compounds in plants, because of its health promoting properties and curing properties to cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis and diabetes respectively  <cit> . phenolic compounds are synthesized through the phenylpropanoid pathway and its biosynthesis starts with the condensation of the phenylalanine which is end product of shikimate pathway . in the first step, deamination reaction involved by the action of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  for the generation of trans-cinnamic acid  <cit> . next, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  and 4-coumaroyl coa ligase  involved in the production of other intermediate metabolites  <cit> . in several side branches, p-coumarate acid 3-hydroxylase  converts p-coumaric acid to caffeic acid which is transformed to ferulic acid, carried out by the enzyme caffeate o-mehtyltransferase   <cit> . also, the enzyme hydroxycinnamoyl-coa quinate hydroxyl cinnamoyl transferase  is involved in synthesis of p-coumaroylquinate from p-coumaroyl coa which is then converted to chlorogenic acid by c3h  <cit> . finally, chalcone synthase , catalyzes naringenin-chalcone, which is the derivative of the flavanoids. in downstream steps, various enzymes such as isomerases, reductases, and hydroxylases involved in the alternation of the basic flavonoid skeleton, leading to the different flavonoid subclasses  <cit> .

recently, whole transcriptome sequencing using next-generation sequencing  technologies, or rna sequencing  has been widely used for the characterization of genes and their functions in secondary metabolite synthesis  <cit> . ngs technologies have efficiency due to its much higher levels of sensitivity, accuracy, dymamic-range of gene expression levels and fast run times  compared to traditional low-throughput expressed sequence tag  sequencing by sanger technology  <cit> . also, many information such as quantitative gene expression, development of functional markets, quick insights into the specific gene space, comparative genomic studies and to isolate genes of interest  <cit> . among the common ngs platforms, including illumina, roche/ <dig>  solid, and helicosheliscope, the illumina hiseq system has been commonly used because of its high throughput sequencing capacity which results in providing a higher coverage and low costs  <cit> . despite these advantages, the sequence reads provide sufficient for de novo assemblies of full-length transcripts, except in the case of small classes of rna  <cit> . for valeriana family, only one transcriptome analysis from the valeriana officinalis have been described in medicinal plant genomics resource , whereas the transcriptome analysis of v. fauriei has not been investigated yet.

in this current study, we used the illuminalhiseq™  <dig> system to obtain the transcriptome in shoot and root of v. fauriei. we present data confirming that new sequencing technology can provide numerous insights into the molecular arrangement of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. in addition, we describe the identification of several full-length and partial-length cdnas encoding genes related to terpenoid, carotenoid, and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways. the transcripts levels of all genes were determined by real-time pcr and quantify the secondary metabolites with high-performance liquid chromatography  to investigate the correlation between the transcriptional regulation of each biosynthetic gene and accumulation of each identified components. till today no information has been provided the transcriptome characterization of v. fauriei.

RESULTS

cdnas prepared from root and shoot of v. fauriei were sequenced using illumina hiseq platform. as a result of sequencing,  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from both samples . initially, total sequences were subjected to preprocessing, resulting in  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads with  <dig> , <dig>   total base. preprocessed sequences were taken for de novo transcriptome assembly using clc assembly cell software. in total,  <dig> different assemblies were generated and the each assembled contig set was qualified with the reference mapping as described in method section. among those, assembly with word size  <dig> was selected as the best with respect to mapping result. in total,  <dig> , <dig>   bases were mapped with coverage of  <dig>  to the best assembled set with  <dig>  contigs . after redundancy removal by cap <dig> assembly,  <dig>   unique sequences were obtained ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average length of  <dig>  bases which were considered as a reference transcriptome for v. fauriei .table  <dig> summary of the transcriptome assembly of v. fauriei

functional annotation
final draft transcriptome was subjected to functional annotations by blastx mapping against to plant uniprot databases to obtain the biological terms with e-value cutoff 1e- <dig> . totally,  <dig>   sequences were matched with at least one biological term among uniprot sequence description, gene ontology  kegg pathway, or cog information. among annotated,  <dig>  sequences were completely obtained the biological term from all databases and the sequences annotated from individual database were  <dig>   sequences with go terms,  <dig>   with cog,  <dig>  with kegg pathway respectively.table  <dig> summary of the annotations of the v. fauriei transcriptome; go, gene onthology; cog, cluster orthologous groups; kegg pathway, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes



among them,  <dig>   sequences were obtained with the e-value in the range of  <dig> to 1e- <dig>  and  <dig>   sequences were with ≥70 % similarity . also, more than a half of mapped v. fauriei transcripts shared annotation information from the three major plant species, i.e. vitis vinifera, solanum tuberosum, and populustricho carpa . go annotations were classified into three subcategories i.e. biological process , molecular functions , and cellular component  . in the cellular component cluster, cells, cell parts, and organelles were shown to be the top  <dig> clusters. among the cluster of molecular functions, binding and catalytic activities were dominant. in the biological process groups, cellular process, metabolic process, and response to stimulus were the largest subcategories. to further characterize the v. fauriei transcriptome, sequences were grouped based on mips functional categories . the data comparison enabled the classification of  <dig> molecular families; the top category was “general function prediction only”. also, the result shows that only 3 % of sequences belong to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism.fig.  <dig> transcripts grouped to go subcategories; biological process , molecular functions  and cellular components  with wego software.  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated and the significant go were plotted in level  <dig> and 2

transcriptome is the full set of transcripts including mrnas, non-coding rnas, and small rnas and their quantity for a specific developmental stage or physiological conditions. transcriptome profiling is widely performed for clarifying all species of transcripts, confirming the transcriptional structure of genes, and quantifying the changing expression levels of each transcript during development and under different conditions  <cit> . the development of next-generation sequencing  technology for whole transcriptome sequencing has offered high-throughput, advances in accuracy and sensitivity and decreased costs compared to traditional est sequencing by sanger technology  <cit> . the improvements in genome sequencing technology have provided a valuable opportunity to sequence increasingly large and complex genome  <cit> . large scale sequencing of several non-model plants which are potential to investigate the basis of medicinal properties has been already assessed to several species i.e., acacia auriculiformis, acacia mangium  <cit> , cajanus cajan l.  <cit> , euphorbia fischeriana  <cit> , myricarubra  <cit> , and so on. although this technology has been extensively practiced to various research areas, genomic information of v. fauriei is still unknown. therefore, transcriptome profiling using ngs from non-model plants is useful to generate a reference genome and to provide the basis of finding genes associated with particular important functions  <cit> .

digital gene expression and secondary metabolite related gene
to analyze the expression profiling of v. fauriei transcriptome from root and shoot, all the transcripts were subjected to digital gene expression  study. first, rpkm values were calculated for each transcript from individual sample. the transcripts with rpkm ≥  <dig>  were considered as being expressed based on previous published information  <cit> . root and shoot specific expressions for all combinations within group were plotted in venn diagram . totally,  <dig>   unique transcripts were expressed at least single condition. for individual samples,  <dig>   transcripts and  <dig>   transcripts were expressed in root and shoot, respectively. among them,  <dig>   transcripts were commonly shown in both root and shoot of v. fauriei. further, expressed transcripts were grouped into more than 2-fold up- or down-regulations .fig.  <dig> digital gene expression transcripts with rpkm ≥  <dig>  from each sample, combinations and specific



between the shoot and root libraries, a total of  <dig>  dges were detected with  <dig>  up-regulated genes  and  <dig> down-regulated genes. to better understand the biological functions of the both organ specific transcripts, dges were grouped according to kegg secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway . results shows that the terpenoids backbone pathway genes and phenylpropanoid related genes were highly upregulated.table  <dig> summary for secondary metabolite genes involved in each biosynthetic pathway



currently, several tools have developed to analyze the gene expression. especially, digital gene expression  is getting popular due to its enrichment for a pathway or ontology term by using overlap statistics from variations in the counts of their cognate sequence tags  <cit> . however, dge requires a reference sequence to align the relative small read lengths  <cit> . indeed, performing dge and rna-seq, which provides reference transcriptome, offers an efficient method to identify the candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in non-model plants  <cit> .

analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes from v. fauriei unigenes
the sequences of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathway genes were identified in the ngs of the v. fauriei database. several full-length cdnas encoding mct, hds, gds, aact, hmgs, mk, pmk, idi, and fds, and partial-length cdnas encoding dxs, dxr, cmk, mds, hdr, and mvd were isolated from v. fauriei in terpenoid biosynthesis . to confirm this for homology, they were designed as vfdxs , vfdxr , vfmct , vfcmk , vfmds , vfhds , vfhdr , vfgds , vfaact , vfhmgs , vfhmgr , vfmk , vfcmk , vfmvd , vfidi , and vffds  and showed sequence similarities according to blast search. additional file  <dig> shows the sequences of carotenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes identified from ngs data of v. fauriei. among carotenoid biosynthetic genes, full-length cdnas of vfpds , vfzds , vfchxb , and vfnced , and partial-length cdnas of vfpsy , vfcrtiso , vflcyb , vflcye , vfchxe , vfzep , and vfccd  were also exhibited. additionally, full-length cdnas of vfcomt , vfchs , vff3h , vff3’h , and vffls  and partial-length cdnas of vfpal , vfc4h , vf4cl , vfc3h , vfhqt , vfchi , vff3’5’h , vffns , vffns <dig> , vfgt , and vfrt  for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were purified from v. fauriei. a blast search at the amino acid level showed that secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes from v. fauriei exhibited high identity to other orthologous genes.

analysis of terpenoid transcript levels and terpenoid content
quantitative real-time pcr analysis was performed to determine the expression levels of terpenoid biosynthetic genes in shoot and root of v. fauiriei . most of genes which are related to mep pathway were expressed at the higher level in root than in shoot of v. fauriei. however, expression levels of vfdxr and vfmds were about  <dig> -,  <dig> -fold higher in shoot than in root of v. fauriei respectively. in contrast, all mva biosynthetic genes showed a minimum of  <dig> - to a maximum of  <dig> -fold higher levels in root than in shoot of v. fauriei. about  <dig> volatile compounds were detected in v. fauriei by gc and gc/ms analysis. all the reported volatile compounds including terpenes are presented in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  among the total volatile compounds, there have been  <dig> terpenes;  <dig> monoterpenes,  <dig> sesquiterpenes, and  <dig> other terpenes isolated from v. fauriei. the results showed that bornyl acetate , cedrol , and α-acrorenol  are the major constituents in root whereas p-cymene  and pentanoic acid  are principal constituents in shoot of v. fauriei. isovaleric acid , causing an unpleasant odor, was detected only in the root. hplc analysis was also done to detect three types of valerenic acid i.e., valerenic acid, acetoxy-valerenic acid, and hydroxyvalerenic acid in both shoot and root of v. fauriei . the accumulation of valerenic acid and acetoxy-valerenic acid were detected only in root of v. fauriei, exhibiting the concentrations of  <dig>  μg/g dry weight,  <dig>  μg/g dry weights, respectively. however, hydroxyvalerenic acid was not present in the analysis of both shoot and root of this plant.fig.  <dig> transcript levels of genes related to terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in shoot and root of v. fauriei. expression levels from three individual replicates were analyzed relative to that of 18s. error bars showed sd values. a mep biosynthetic genes, b mva biosynthetic genes 



until now, most of the studies have focused on root part of valeriana species, whereas aerial part has been studied very rarely. leaf contained valeric acid-related compounds as the major compounds  <cit> . in addition, patchouli alcohol, α-pinene, and β-pinene were shown mainly in the oil of aerial parts of v. dioschoridis. patchouli alcohol and isovaleric acid contributed major level of oil in the aerial parts of v. celtica  <cit> . according to our study, p-cymene and pentanoic acid were detected as major compounds, whereas bornyl isovalerate is present as a little amount in shoot of v. fauriei. the major active compounds present in valeriana species such as valerenic acid and its derivatives, and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids were accumulated in roots and rhizomes principally  <cit> . as expected, valerenic acid-related compounds were shown only in root of v. fauriei. besides, the main compounds of root of this plant were bornyl acetate, cedrol, α-acrorenol. these findings are quite similar to the result of chen h et al. <cit> . they showed that bornyl acetate were the major constituent of the essential oil from the root and rhizomes of v. alternifolia.

analysis of carotenoid transcript levels and carotenoid content
we conducted real-time pcr to investigate carotenogenic transcript levels between shoot and root of v. fauriei and analyzed the carotenoid content by hplc. results revealed that the transcripts levels of carotenoid biosynthetic genes were highly expressed as maximum as  <dig> -fold at lcye to a minimum of  <dig> -fold at pds showing more in the shoot than in the root of v. fauriei . however, expression levels of nced and ccd, those are involved in synthesis of aprocarotenoids such as abscisic acid showed a higher level of about  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold in root than in shoot respectively. five different carotenoids i.e., violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, α-carotene, β-carotene, and 9-cis-β-carotene were detectedin v. fauriei . higher levels of all carotenoid content were detected in the shoot, whereas only a few quantities of β-carotene and 9-cis-β-carotene were detected in the root of v. fauriei.fig.  <dig> transcrip levels of genes related to carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in shoot and root of v. fauriei. expression levels from three individual replicates were analyzed relative to that of 18s. error bars showed sd values



carotenoids were produced in the photosynthetic organ  of v. fauriei in abundance. in contrast, the production of carotenoid in the underground organ  is rarely occurred. the results of the present study correspond well with those found in the earlier experimental studies in chinese cabbage  <cit>  and bitter melon  <cit> .

analysis of phenylpropanoid transcript levels and phenolic compound content
the genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway were examined both in shoot and root of v. fauriei . six types of phenolic compound such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, rutin, trans-cinnamic acid, and quercetin were found in v. fauriei through hplc analysis . expression levels of pal, c3h, hqt, f3h, f3’h, fns, and fns <dig> were much higher in shoot than in root of v. fauriei, whereas a few other genes were expressed higher in root. every phenolic compound except for chlorogenic acid and quercetin was accumulated highly in the root compared to that of in the shoot. rutin is synthesized from quercetin by attaching one glucose and one rhamnose, catalyzed by gt and rt. in root of v. fauriei, where the level of expression of gt and rt genes were higher, also the amount of rutin was higher in the root than that in the shoot. in contrast, quercetin content was more in the shoot. it may be caused due to differential gene activities of gt and rt as well. key enzymes for chlorogenic acid synthesis; c3h and hqt were expressed at the higher level in shoot than in root and lead to a large quantity of chlorogenic acid production.fig.  <dig> transcript levels of genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway in shoot of root of v. fauriei. expression levels from three individual replicates were analyzed relative to that of 18s. error bars showed sd values



in some studies, phenolic compounds including luteolin, apigenin, quercetin, kaempferol, and ferulic acid have been identified from both above ground biomass and root of valeriana family  <cit> . also, andres navarrete et al. have demonstrated that chlorogenic acid quantified in a range of  <dig>  to 2 % from v. jatamansi, v. procera, v. edulis, v. sitchensis, and v. officinalis  <cit> . the well-known phenolic compounds i.e., trans-caffeic acid and rutin were confirmed in v. jatamansi  <cit> . according to the result of indra d. bhatt et al., caffeic acid was highly detected in the aerial part of planted source, whereas chlorogenic acid was found in a higher amount in the root part that in aerial part of v. jatamansi  <cit> . these findings are in contrast to our results. here in this study, it was demonstrated that caffeic acid shows quite similarly in both root and shoot of v. fauriei. besides, chlorogenic acid was more in shoot of v. fauriei where c3h and hqt genes expressed highly. the big differences with regard to chemical constituents indicated that these species are based on morphological  <cit> .

metabolic profiles between shoot and root of v. fauriei using gc-tofms analysis
the primary core metabolites such as organic acids, amino acids, and sugars determined using gc-tofms revealed clear metabolite differentiation between various biological samples. chromatof software was used to support peak findings prior to quantitative analysis and for automated deconvolution of reference mass spectra. the nist and the in-house libraries for standard chemicals were utilized for the identification of the compounds, which  <dig> metabolites were detected in the samples.

principle component analysis  widely used to differentiate and correlate the components. forty two quantified metabolites were normalized to the is signal intensity were subjected to pca to outline the differences between the metabolite profiles of the shoot and root samples. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the first and second principal components of the pca score plot represented  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total variance of the samples, respectively. the pca results clearly showed the absence of marked variances between samples of same tissue. the corresponding loading was negative for serine, glyceric acid, threonic acid, fructose, galactose, mannitol, trehalose, and raffinose, indicating that the  <dig> metabolites were higher in shoot than in root. interestingly, glucose, phenylalanine, and shikimic acid associated with terpenoid, carotenoid, and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways showed higher levels in root than in shoot. combined transcriptome and targeted metabolic profiling data possibly provides correlations between genes and metabolites in given biological systems on a whole-genome or metabolome scale  <cit> . also, ngs with metabolomics tools can provide insight into the nature of transcript-metabolite networks because of the increased ease and efficiency  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pca score plots  and loading plots  derived from polar metabolites of shoot and root of v. fauriei. pc <dig> and pc <dig> accounted for > <dig>  % of the total variance. the ellipse represents the hotelling t <dig> with 95 % confidence in the score plot. the loading plots represent the original variables in the space of the pcs. they reveal the magnitude and direction of correlation of the original variables with the first two pcs.  <dig>  lactic acid;  <dig>  valine;  <dig>  alanine;  <dig>  glycolic acid;  <dig>  serine;  <dig>  ethanolamine;  <dig>  glycerol;  <dig>  isoleucine;  <dig>  proline;  <dig>  nicotinic acid;  <dig>  glycine;  <dig>  succinic acid;  <dig>  glyceric acid;  <dig>  fumaric acid;  <dig>  threonine;  <dig>  β-alanine;  <dig>  malic acid;  <dig>  aspartic acid;  <dig>  methionine;  <dig>  pyroglutamic acid;  <dig>  4-aminobutyric acid;  <dig>  threonic acid;  <dig>  arginine;  <dig>  glutamic acid;  <dig>  phenylalanine;  <dig>  xylose;  <dig>  asparagine;  <dig>  glutamine;  <dig>  shikimic acid;  <dig>  citric acid;  <dig>  quinic acid;  <dig>  fructose;  <dig>  galactose;  <dig>  glucose;  <dig>  mannose;  <dig>  mannitol;  <dig>  inositol;  <dig>  tryptophan;  <dig>  sucrose;  <dig>  maltose;  <dig>  trehalose;  <dig>  raffinose



in further study, we expect that tissue-specific transcript profiling can provide insights into biological, functional differences between independent transcripts of both shoot and root of v. fauriei. in addition, there is an opportunity to produce medicinal substances for industrial purposes in both quality and quantity through genetic engineering.

CONCLUSIONS
in present study, we obtained a total of  <dig>  unigenes using illumina hiseq system from v. fauriei. among them, there were  <dig>  annotated genes with uniprot blast hits and mapped to go, cog, and kegg pathway. individually,  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in root and shoot, respectively of v. fauriei. transcripts were highly involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis compared to other biosynthesis by grouping into kegg secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathway. therefore, we found that de novo transciptome sequencing with dge analysis is a modern novel technique for the identification of specific genes for the candidate enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in v. fauriei. we also investigated the expression of genes suggested an association with secondary metabolism in root and shoot of v. fauriei. most of genes related to terpenoid biosynthesis are highly expressed in root than in shoot of v. fauriei. also, we confirmed the presence of about  <dig> volatile compounds those are isolated from v. fauriei using gc/ms and also it is mentionable that valerenic acid-related compounds are shown only in the root of this plant. however, all carotenoid biosynthetic genes except nced and ccd were expressed in a higher rate in the shoot than that of in the root of this plant. in addition, carotenoids were commonly accumulated in shoot. a couple of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes are expressed higher in the shoot and others are expressed in a higher rate in the root of v. fauriei showing in different amounts.

according to transcriptome databases, the comparison of gene expression and metabolite accumulation were achieved in this study. the transcriptome analysis for v. fauriei gives an opportunity to characterize genes leading to the synthesis of secondary metabolites, compounds of interest.
