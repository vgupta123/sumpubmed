BACKGROUND
the identification of causal links between human genotypes and disease phenotypes is
a key challenge in human genomics, genetics and medicine. the high-throughput data
generated by next-generation sequencing , microarray studies, genome-wide
association studies  and copy number variation  provide thousands of
variants per individual  <cit> . most bioinformatic methods for identifying genes potentially associated
with specific phenotypes  <cit>  are not optimized for mendelian traits with complete or incomplete
clinical penetrance, because they lack the metrics for estimating the relatedness of
genes not belonging to the same biological function pathway, or because they
generate complex networks that are difficult to interpret, resulting in low
discovery rates for disease-causing alleles in high-throughput studies  <cit> .

the causal genes of a specific phenotype are generally expected to be functionally
close to each other  <cit> . candidate genes are therefore picked from high-throughput data on the
basis of their biological proximity to core genes — genes already known to be
responsible for the phenotype. we recently developed a novel approach, the
“human gene connectome” . the hgc consists of a method and database
describing the set of in silico-predicted biologically plausible routes and
distances between all pairs of human genes. we used this method to generate a
“gene-specific connectome” for each human gene, making it possible to
rank all human genes in terms of their biological proximity to a core gene of
interest. we have demonstrated that the hgc is an effective approach for identifying
mendelian disease-causing genes in high-throughput genetic data, by the ranking of
genes according to their biological proximity to core genes known to be associated
with the phenotype of interest, as demonstrated by a case study of herpes simplex
encephalitis  and tlr <dig> pathway genes  <cit> .

we present here the human gene connectome server : a novel, effective and
easy-to-use interactive online interface through which users can submit any gene
list generated by high-throughput techniques  for automatic ranking in terms of biological distance and connectivity
p-value to the known core genes of the phenotype of interest, and the
predicted route between the genes of interest. the hgcs is based on the hgc-derived
concept of biological distance between gene pairs , and provides, for the first time, an opportunity for
investigators of all backgrounds to prioritize independently lists of genes of any
size, according to their biological distance to core genes. we also provide a new
database of  <dig>  human gene-specific connectomes. we demonstrate the power of the
hgcs for prioritizing candidate genes, with whole-exome sequencing  data from
 <dig> patients with hse  <cit> , mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease   <cit> , or invasive pneumococcal disease   <cit> . we compare hgcs with state-of-the-art methods.

implementation
generation of the hgc and of all human gene-specific connectomes
we extracted data for all direct human protein-protein physical interactions from
the updated string version  <dig>    <cit>  and inverted the interaction confidence scores to obtain direct
biological distances, which we used to create a weighted graph of all available
human genes. we applied a shortest distance algorithm to find the biological
distance and route between all pairs of human genes, to generate the full hgc,
with the python networkx package for complex network analysis  <cit> . we then generated a gene-specific connectome, by ranking all human
genes according to their hgc-predicted biological distance to a core gene. we
repeated the process for all human genes . the human gene-specific
connectomes are available for use and can be downloaded from:
http://lab.rockefeller.edu/casanova/hgc.

database and online server implementation
the full hgc and gene annotation data are stored on a server, as indexed tables
in a mysql database. all human gene-specific connectomes were converted into a
mysql table. the gene aliases and annotations were compiled from ensembl biomart  <cit> . the main code for ranking and annotations was written in php, so
that it could be run directly from the server. the program uses mysqli_query()
commands to access the database and generate queries. the program is designed to
maximize gene discovery, by automatically detecting gene aliases if the input is
not the conventional gene name, and adding the full gene name  and alternative aliases.

computing resources and programming languages
we generated the new hgc and all derived human gene-specific connectomes with a
mac pro computer with a 12-core intel cpu and  <dig> gb ram. the initial data
filtering and text mining of the string database were performed with the perl
programming language. the hgc, gene-specific connectomes and simulations were
generated with the python programming language. the hgcs is hosted on the
rockefeller university lamp shared server, with a vmware instance of  <dig> gb.

RESULTS
the human gene connectome server 
the hgcs is a gene prioritization and connectivity online interface based on
biological distance, which allows users to generate queries about any set of
core and target genes. this system can be used for the rapid prediction of the
biological distance and connection route between any two given genes of
interest, and for the effective prioritization of any number of genes generated
by high-throughput methods, on the basis of their biological distance to core
genes associated with the human trait of interest or, alternatively, on the
basis of p-value or best reciprocal p-value . a schematic representation of the hgcs generation
workflow is shown in figure  <dig>  the output can be
sorted by proximity to any of the core genes provided, or internally separated
by core gene. figure  <dig> shows screenshots of the hgcs
online platform, demonstrating the ranking of  <dig> genes from wes data for an hse

this patient, ticam <dig> , was ranked # <dig> among the 284
genes. the human gene connectome server is available from:

the full gene name.

assessment of the performance of the hgcs
we assessed the power of the hgcs to detect mendelian disease-causing mutations
from the wes data of  <dig> patients with severe mendelian diseases:  <dig> patients with
hse,  <dig> patients with msmd and  <dig> patients with ipd. the genes with
disease-causing mutations in the hse patients were shown experimentally to be
ticam <dig> , traf <dig> 
tbk <dig> , and unc93b <dig>   <cit> . the genes with disease-causing mutations in the msmd patients were
shown experimentally to be ifngr <dig> , isg <dig> 
stat <dig>  il12rb <dig> , and il12b <cit> . rbck <dig> was identified as the gene with disease-causing
mutations in the ipd patients  <cit> . we performed standard filtering for the variants:  excluding
synonymous variations,  keeping rare variations, with a frequency <1% in
the  <dig> genomes  <cit>  and nhlbi exome variant server
 databases, and 
accounting for sequencing batch effects and highly mutated genes  by in-house filtering of variants appearing in more than
 <dig> % of the patients in all disease cohorts other than for the specific disease
tested .

filtering decreased the median number of variant genes per patient to  <dig>  we
chose tlr <dig> as the core gene for hse, ifng as the core gene for
msmd, and ikbkg as the core gene for ipd, because these genes have been
experimentally validated as central genes in the gene pathways associated with
the pathogenesis of these diseases  <cit> . we used the hgcs to rank all gene variants for each patient
according to biological proximity to the core gene associated with the
patient’s disease. we then compared the performance, interface and
functions of the hgcs with those of two other state-of-the-art methods: 
funcoup, using the maxlink interface, which ranks top interactors, and 
humannet, which ranks by top subnetworks  <cit> . in both funcoup and humannet, we added the relevant core genes to
the analyses, and chose the first cluster/subnetwork containing the true disease
gene.

the human gene-specific connectome database
we generated and made available  <dig>  human gene-specific connectomes, each
containing the set of all human genes ranked by their biological proximity to
the specific core gene of interest. each gene-specific connectome contains the
following data categories regarding the nature of the connection between the
core gene and the target genes: hgc-predicted biological distance, rank among
all human genes according to distance to the core gene, p-value for
connectivity, brp, the ratio between the core gene—target gene distance
and the median distance between the core gene and all human genes, the ratio
between the core gene—target gene distance and mean distance between the
core gene and all human genes, the sphere around the core gene , the predicted route , degrees of separation , and the full name of the target gene. all human
gene-specific connectomes are available from:
http://lab.rockefeller.edu/casanova/hgc.

comparison of the hgcs with state-of-the-art methods
we assessed the ability of the hgcs to prioritize candidate genes in
high-throughput data, using wes data for  <dig> patients who suffered from herpes
simplex encephalitis   <cit> , mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease   <cit> , or invasive pneumococcal disease   <cit>  due to single-gene inborn errors of immunity. there was a median of
 <dig> wes-filtered genes per patient. additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 7: tables s1-s <dig> show the
prioritized wes genes for each hse patient, together with the connectivity
between these genes and tlr <dig> predicted by the hgcs. additional files
 <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 
 <dig> and 14: tables
s8-s <dig> show the prioritized wes genes for each msmd patient, and additional
files  <dig> and 16: tables
s <dig> and s <dig> show the prioritized wes genes for each ipd patient. the true
hse-causing genes  were ranked # <dig> in all seven patients, in terms of biological proximity
to tlr <dig> among the wes-filtered genes,
p =  <dig> e- <dig>  the true msmd-causing genes
 were ranked # <dig> in five
patients and # <dig> in two patients, in terms of biological proximity to
ifng among the wes-filtered genes,
p =  <dig> e- <dig>  the true ipd-causing gene
 was ranked # <dig> in one patient and # <dig> in
the second patient, in terms of biological proximity to ikbkg among the
wes-filtered genes, p =  <dig> .

we compared the results obtained with those for two other state-of-the-art
methods :  funcoup: the true disease gene was ranked  <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> of
 <dig>  in  <dig> of the  <dig> patients ; 
humannet : the true disease-causing gene was ranked between #5
and # <dig> of  <dig> to  <dig> clusters in  <dig> patients, and was not ranked in the
remaining four patients. funcoup and humannet cannot rank genes relative to a
core gene, and the prediction therefore relates to a significant subnetwork
containing the true disease-causing gene. predictions also involve manual
browsing of the output, making these methods less feasible for situations in
which ranking on the basis of several core genes is desired.

the hgcs differs from the funcoup and humannet interfaces in several major ways.
funcoup is based on direct interactors or highly connected networks, and is
therefore particularly powerful for predicting closely related genes. by
contrast, humannet was designed for the discovery of new genes in a pathway, and
is therefore more suitable for more distantly related genes. humannet provided
results for  <dig> of the  <dig> patients . neither funcoup nor humannet is gene-centric. these
methods are therefore unable to rank a list of genes according to their
biological proximity to a set of genes of interest, and they provide no
information about the route connecting human genes of interest. additional files
17: table s <dig> shows comparisons of the
performances of the hgcs, funcoup and humannet interfaces for the detection of
disease-causing genes from wes data. in summary, for the  <dig> mendelian
disease-causing genes for the patients whose wes data were studied here, the
hgcs outperformed funcoup in  <dig> of the  <dig> tests, and outperformed humannet in 14
of the  <dig> tests.

one of the major aims in studies of mendelian diseases is to identify, at the
single-patient level, a single gene associated with the disease. in this
respect, the hgcs is more effective than funcoup and humannet, because it is the
only interface that ranks all candidate genes on the basis of their relationship
to the given core gene. the other interfaces involve a binary yes/no indication
of relatedness to core genes, making it difficult to differentiate between the
genes related to the core gene and to identify the specific disease-causing
gene. funcoup and humannet are conceptually easier to apply in polygenic/complex
genetic studies, as the input for these two interfaces is the full set of
candidate genes and there is no need to supply a core gene, and they provide
subnetworks that can be inferred to be related to the disease.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we present here the hgcs — the first online platform for prioritizing any
number of genes on the basis of their biological distance to any number of core
genes and the relationships between them. we are making available an updated
database of all human gene-specific connectomes. we demonstrate the high performance
of the hgcs for high-throughput mendelian and monogenic studies. we propose an
effective method for the use of the hgcs to detect new disease-related genes, based
on the collation of central core genes known to be associated with the disease and
their use to rank the candidate genes by distance, p-value, or brp . we suggest
that p-values or brp could be used to rank lists of gene candidates, rather
than for drawing statistical/translational conclusions that a gene is relevant to
the phenotype on the basis of statistical significance.

the hgcs performance is dependent upon a reliable selection of core gene
associated with the phenotype. this task is straightforward when certain causal
genes have already been identified in previous studies. however, in the absence of
experimentally validated core genes, the identification of candidate core genes is
not trivial. in such cases, we suggest using core genes of the phenotypes most
similar to the phenotype of interest, or alternatively using other state-of-the-art
approaches described in this work, such as funcoup and humannet. the
centrality/connectivity of the selected core genes also influences the hgcs
performance, which, in the case of ipd, was decreased with ikbkg as a core
gene . we suggest that since ikbkg is a
highly central/connected gene with a high number of strongly associated genes, it is
less effective for differentiating the highly ranked gene candidates. in such cases
we propose ranking by additional core genes, if available.

the hgcs has several unique features not found in other state-of-the-art
methodologies, including the prediction of meaningful indirect interactions, the
provision of a biological distance and route between any two given human genes of
interest, and its gene-centric nature, making it particularly useful in diseases or
pathways for which associated genes have already been detected and for which the
task is detecting and describing new disease- or pathway-associated genes. we
anticipate that the rigorous use of the hgcs and the novel concept of biological
distance will significantly increase the rate of discovery of new genotype-phenotype
causal relationships.
