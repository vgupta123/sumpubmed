BACKGROUND
nuclear proteins play critical roles in regulating mrna transcription and processing, dna replication, and epigenetic genome modification. nuclear proteins generally contain a nuclear localization signal  sequence , a short peptide that mediates the transport of nuclear proteins into the nucleus. the nls can be recognized by kap or the importin α/β heterodimer. in yeast, approximately 27 % of proteins are targeted to the nucleus  <cit> . however, knowledge concerning nuclear proteins in plants is limited due to the lack of highly efficient screening methods and gene functional annotation information. therefore, efficient screening methods are required for plant research.

traditionally, the isolation and identification of nuclear proteins is achieved using conventional proteomic strategies or cell-based approached that tag proteins with an epitope or green fluorescent protein  for the detection of intracellular localization  <cit> . however, these methods achieve low screening efficiency and are time-consuming. in  <dig>  the nuclear transportation trap  developed by ueki et al. was used to screen for nuclear-targeted proteins in a human fetal brain cdna library  <cit> . rice cdna libraries from three developmental stages have also been screened using the ntt system  <cit> . the main advantages of the ntt system for large-scale nuclear protein isolation are its efficiencies in cost, time, and labor. although the ntt system achieves significantly greater screening efficiency than traditional methods, the efficiency of this technique, particularly in screening nuclear-targeted proteins, can be improved further. moreover, the ntt system should be further improved to enable the screening of differentially expressed nuclear proteins in combination with other molecular biological approaches.

rye  is an important crop that exhibits strong resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the functional analysis of rye has lagged behind that of other cereals, possibly due the large size of its genome  and the lack of available genomic information. the construction of genetic, physical, and qtl maps for rye has revealed the presence of genes  that are related to its strong resistance to rust and mildew and to its aluminum tolerance  <cit> . however, few resistance genes have been identified in rye thus far; such genes would be important for the molecular breeding of cereals, particularly wheat. wheat-rye translocations are widely used in wheat breeding to confer resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses, and various forms of the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig>   have been introduced to confer disease and pest resistance to wheat   <cit> ; approximately 50 % of wheat varieties maintained by the international maize and wheat improvement center  contain the 1bl.1rs translocation  <cit> . therefore, the screening and functional analysis of resistance genes in rye is useful for improving wheat resistance via genetic transformation.

in this study, an integrative nuclear transportation trap  was developed by integrating an improved ntt system and the “after suppression subtraction” method. in the intt system, the plexad vector was used to screen a cdna library instead of the plexad-nes vector, which was previously used in ntt systems. the intt system demonstrated a higher screening efficiency than previous ntt systems when screening for nls and gmareb nuclear proteins. to identify temperature-resistant and temperature-responsive genes in rye, a low temperature-treated rye cdna library was screened using the intt system; consequently,  <dig> unique genes were identified. four nuclear proteins  were selected for further functional analysis. subcellular localization analysis indicated that all of the four candidate proteins were localized in the nucleus, and q-rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that all four genes were expressed at higher levels in response to low-temperature stress. sct <dig> and sct <dig> overexpression can enhance high-temperature and freezing-stress tolerances in transgenic plants, respectively. in short, the intt system proved useful for isolating important nuclear-targeted proteins that are induced under various treatment conditions.

RESULTS
construction and screening efficiency of the intt system
in our intt system, the vector plexad contains the fragment lexad, which comprises the dna-binding domain of the lexa transcription factor and a transactivation gal <dig> transcription factor domain . in a previously used ntt system, the vector plexad-nes was constructed using the fragment nes-lexad, which encodes the nuclear export signal  of the human immunodeficiency virus\ regulator of virion protein expression    <cit> .fig.  <dig> vectors and screening efficiency of the intt system. a yeast cells transformed with plexad. b yeast cells transformed with plexad-nes. c yeast cells transformed with plexad-nls. d yeast cells transformed with plexad-nes-nls. e yeast cells transformed with plexad-gmareb. f yeast cells transformed with plexad-nes-gmareb. g the expression cassettes used in the ntt system. padh1: yeast alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  gene promoter; lexa: dna-binding domain of the lexa protein; gal4ad: transactivation domain of the gal <dig> protein; tdah1: terminator of the adh <dig> gene. h the expression cassettes used in the intt system. i the expression cassettes used in the intt system fused to gmareb. j the number of yeast clones transformed with the four vectors plexad-nls, plexad-nes-nls, plexad-gmareb, and plexad-nes-gmareb



to compare the screening efficiencies of these vectors, two differently sized proteins were evaluated: a  <dig> amino acid nls from the sv <dig> large t antigen protein and a  <dig> amino acid bzip-like transcription factor   <cit> . a gene encoding the sv <dig> large t antigen nls was inserted into plexad and plexad-nes to generate the fused vectors plexad-nls and plexad-nes-nls, respectively. equal amounts  of plexad, plexad-nes, plexad-nls and plexad-nes-nls dna were transformed into yeast cells , and the transformants were grown on sd medium lacking leucine and histidine  at 30 °c for 4 days. as shown in fig.  <dig>  plexad and plexad-nes transformants did not grow on selection medium  , unlike the plexad-nls and plexad-nes-nls transformants, which did grow . the number of plexad-nls transformants was 9-fold higher than that of plexad-nes-nls  in three replicate experiments, suggesting that plexad can provide greater screening efficiency than plexad-nes.

to further evaluate the screening efficiencies of these vectors at detecting larger transcription factors, gmareb, a bzip-like transcription factor previously reported by our laboratory  <cit> , was inserted into both plexad and plexad-nes to produce plexad-gmareb and plexad-nes-gmareb, respectively . similar to the results obtained using nls, yeast cells transformed with plexad-gmareb or plexad-nes-gmareb were able to grow on the selection medium , and the number of plexad-gmareb transformants was 15-fold higher than that of plexad-nes-gmareb . collectively, these results demonstrate that using the vector plexad and our intt system is more efficient for screening transcription factor genes than using the vector plexad-nes and the previously reported ntt system.

identification of cold-responsive nuclear proteins in rye using the intt system
two rye cdna libraries  were inserted into the vector plexad and transformed into the yeast strain egy <dig>  nuclear proteins that were differentially expressed in response to cold stress were further identified using the “after suppression subtraction” method. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> positive clones with sequence lengths greater than 500 bp were selected and further sequenced in the control and cold-treated cdna libraries, respectively. a total of  <dig> est sequences were obtained from the two cdna libraries . a blast analysis  of the  <dig> est sequences further identified  <dig> unique genes that encoded high-confidence proteins. among these  <dig> unique sequences,  <dig> were expressed in both libraries . finally,  <dig> genes were considered to be cold-induced according to the “after suppression subtraction” method . based on ncbi entries and annotations, these  <dig> unique proteins include  <dig> of known function and  <dig> of unknown function.

using the go classification scheme, these  <dig> known proteins were further categorized according to biological process , cellular component  and molecular function . the largest percentage of genes was involved in cellular processes when sorted by biological process . of the genes sorted by cellular components, 79 % were intracellular , and of the genes sorted by molecular function, 31 % exhibited sequence-specific dna-binding transcription factor activity . a psort analysis  suggested that  <dig> out of the  <dig> unique genes  function as transcriptional regulators, transcription factors and/or dna/rna-binding proteins. importantly, these  <dig> nuclear proteins were only expressed in the 5-h cold-treated cdna library and included sct <dig> , sct <dig> , sct <dig> , and sct <dig> .fig.  <dig> go enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. gene function classification of  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between two rye cdna libraries based on the biological process go consortium , the cellular component go consortium  and the molecular function go consortium 



subcellular localization analysis of four cold-induced nuclear proteins from rye
to identify genes that are importantly responsible for cold tolerance in rye, four putative nuclear proteins, the expression levels of which were more than 10-fold higher in the 5-h cold treatment cdna library , were selected for further genetic and functional analyses. to study the subcellular localization of these four proteins, the corresponding full-length cdna sequences were fused to the 5´ end of the 163hgfp gene under the control of the camv35s promoter, and the four resulting recombinant plasmids were transformed into onion epidermal cells for use in transient expression assays. as shown in fig.  <dig>  fluorescence was detected throughout the entire cell in transformants containing the positive control plasmid constructed using 163hgfp ; in contrast, in cells transformed with sct <dig>  sct <dig>  sct <dig> or sct <dig>  fluorescence was only detected in the nucleus , suggesting that these four proteins were localized to the nucleus.fig.  <dig> nuclear localization of four rye proteins. a the control vector 35s::gfp, b 35s::sct1/163hgfp, c 35s::sct36/163hgfp, d 35s::sct133/163hgfp and e 35s::sct196/163hgfp were transiently expressed in onion cells. column , merged images; column , gfp fluorescence; column , overlaid images. the images were visualized using a confocal microscope. the positive-control plasmid 35s::163hgfp encoded only gfp



cold-induced expression patterns of four nuclear protein genes in rye
the expression patterns of the four nuclear protein genes after low-temperature treatment were analyzed using q-rt-pcr. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the transcripts of the four nuclear protein genes were highly upregulated after cold treatment. the increased expression of sct <dig> and sct <dig> was time-dependent and reached relatively high levels after 24 h of cold treatment . the expressions of sct <dig> and sct <dig> exhibited a biphasic pattern with acute increases within the first 1 h and 5 h of cold treatment, respectively, followed by decreases . these results suggest that the expression of these four genes is induced by and is responsive to cold stress and that the intt system can be reliably used to screen for differentially expressed nuclear protein genes in a cdna library.fig.  <dig> expression profile analysis of four nuclear protein genes in rye. total rna was isolated from rye seedlings that were exposed to low temperatures for various times. total rna  was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cdna for qrt-pcr. the actin gene was amplified as a control. the expression levels are presented as values relative to the average expression of the actin gene. a expression of the sct <dig> gene. b expression of the sct <dig> gene. c expression of the sct <dig> gene. d expression of the sct <dig> gene. the mean and se of three biological and technical replicates are presented



overexpression of sct <dig> increased tolerance to low-temperature stresses in transgenic plants
rt-pcr detection confirmed that sct <dig> was transcribed in t <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines . three independent t <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing sct <dig> were subjected to freezing analyses. after low-temperature stress  for 2 h, wild-type  arabidopsis leaves wilted, turned purple and died; in contrast, the leaves of sct36-transgenic plants became yellow after treatment but returned to green after 7 days of recovery time . the leaf survival rates of the three independent transgenic lines tsct36- <dig>  tsct36- <dig>  and tsct36- <dig> were  <dig>   <dig> and 83 %, respectively, whereas that of wt was only 30 % .fig.  <dig> freezing-stress tolerance and relative electrical conductivity of sct3-transgenic arabidopsis plants. a rt-pcr analysis of t <dig> transgenic plants. b growth of wt  and transgenic  lines after freezing treatment. the plants were placed in a chamber at −10 °c for 2 h and then moved to normal conditions. c survival frequency was determined after the plants recovered for 7 days under normal conditions. ** indicates significantly different values between wt and transgenic plants . d relative electrical conductivity of wt and transgenic arabidopsis were determined after exposure to −10 °c for 2 h. ** indicates significantly different values before and after the treatment . the results shown represent the means of three replicates ± sd



relative electrical conductivity can be used as a measure of cell membrane stability, and to further understand the role of sct <dig> in the cold stress response, the relative conductivities of the transgenic arabidopsis lines were measured before and after freezing. before freezing, no differences in relative conductivity were apparent between the wt and transgenic plants . after two hours of freezing treatment , the relative conductivity values of all of the plants were increased; however, the conductivity of the three transgenic lines tsct36- <dig>  tsct36- <dig>  and tsct36- <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, which was lower than that of the control  . these results suggest that sct <dig> overexpression decreases chilling injury and enhances the tolerance of transgenic plants to freezing conditions. similar freezing analyses were also performed on an sct1-transgenic plant; however, no difference was observed between the transgenic and wt plants under low-temperature stress.

overexpression of sct <dig> increased tolerance to high-temperature stresses in transgenic plants
rt-pcr detection confirmed that sct <dig> was transcribed in t <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines . to investigate whether sct <dig> plays a role in response to heat stress, we heat-treated sct1-transgenic plant at 42 °c for 3 h. after 7 days of recovery time, wt plants began to exhibit visual symptoms of heat-induced damage, such as leaf yellowing and severe wilting ; in contrast, the transgenic plants exhibited stronger tolerance to the heat treatment, and there was no obvious effect on transgenic plant development and growth. the leaf survival rates of the three independent transgenic lines tsct1- <dig>  tsct1- <dig>  and tsct1- <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>  and 86 %, respectively, whereas that of wt was only 28 % . the chlorophyll levels in the transgenic and wt plants, an important indicator of photosynthesis  <cit> , were measured after heat treatment for 3 h. as shown in fig. 6d, the chlorophyll levels of the three independent transgenic lines tsct1- <dig>  tsct1- <dig>  and tsct1- <dig> were  <dig>  mg/g,  <dig>  mg/g and  <dig>  mg/g before heat treatment and were not significantly different from that of wt plants . although heat treatment significantly decreased the chlorophyll contents in all of the plants, the remaining chlorophyll level was higher in transgenic than in wt plants. the chlorophyll levels of the three independent transgenic lines tsct1- <dig>  tsct1- <dig>  and tsct1- <dig> were  <dig>  mg/g,  <dig>  mg/g, and  <dig>  mg/g, respectively, whereas that of wt was only  <dig>  mg/g . these data suggest that sct <dig> overexpression can improve heat stress tolerance in transgenic plants.fig.  <dig> heat-stress tolerance and chlorophyll levels in sct1-transgenic arabidopsis plants. a rt-pcr analysis of t <dig> transgenic plants. b growth of wt  and transgenic  lines after heat treatment. plants were exposed to 42 °c for 3 h and then placed in normal conditions for 7 days. c survival frequency was determined after the plants recovered for 7 days under normal conditions. the results shown represent the averages of three replicates ± sd. ** indicates significantly different values between wt and transgenic plants . d the chlorophyll levels  in leaves were measured after heat treatment for 3 days. ** indicates significantly different values before and after treatment . the results shown represent the means of three replicates ± sd



discussion
the screening efficiency of the intt system established in this study was higher than that obtained using the previous ntt system. upon transforming the same amount of dna encoding a short peptide nls or the transcription factor gmareb into yeast, the resulting numbers of transformants using plexad and our intt system were 9- and 15-fold higher, respectively, compared to plexad-nes and the ntt system . the plexad-nes vector is commonly used for screening with the ntt system. ueki reported that yeast cells transformed with plexad-nes could not grow on selection medium, whereas yeast cells transformed with plexad grew well on selection medium  <cit> . ueki et al. suggested that lexad fusion proteins could enter the nucleus by passive diffusion and that the nes sequence probably prevented the generation of false-positive clones  <cit> . the incorporation of an nls into pnes-lexad was sufficient for colony formation, and although the nes-nls-lexad fusion protein might shuttle continuously between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the retention period of the chimera in the nucleus was sufficient for reporter gene transactivation. mouse embryo and rice cdna libraries were employed for further applications of the ntt system to isolate nuclear proteins  <cit> . however, in our study, we found that yeast cells transformed with plexad did not grow on selection medium , and the same result has been reported in numerous repeated tests . therefore, we speculate that either the passive diffusion of lexad described by ueki et al. did not occur or the passive diffusion of the lexad protein was insufficient to enable nuclear entry  <cit> . moreover, no nls sequence is present in the fusion protein encoded by the lexa dna-binding domain and the gal <dig> transactivation domain  <cit> . therefore, a redundant nes sequence would not only fail to reduce false positives but would also reduce the screening efficiency of the ntt system, possibly explaining the difference in screening efficiencies observed between the intt and the ntt systems. thus, unlike transcriptomic sequencing analyses or proteomic approaches, the ntt system saves cost, time, and labor, and the screening efficiency of the intt system was further improved for large-scale nuclear protein screening compared with the previous ntt system.

the intt system can be applied to screens for novel nuclear proteins and to study the dynamic composition of nucleoproteins under biotic and abiotic stresses, and these types of analyses are important to study gene expression regulatory mechanisms and to isolate key regulatory genes after treatment. winter rye is the most frost-resistant cereal  <cit> , and screening for cold tolerance-related genes in rye would be useful for improving the cold tolerance of other cereals such as wheat or rice. in this research, after screening two rye libraries obtained using control and 5 h low-temperature treatments, shared sequences from both libraries were eliminated using the “after suppression subtraction” method, resulting in  <dig> unique sequences; of these sequences,  <dig> were differentially expressed after treatment . of these differentially expressed genes, 31 % were annotated as having dna-binding transcription factor activity according to go classification . moreover, half of the proteins of known function  were predicted to localize to the nucleus , and four proteins  were identified as nuclear-targeted and highly expressed upon cold treatment . moreover, the intt system was successfully applied to screen soybean and wheat libraries in our laboratory, and many nuclear proteins, such as gmnac2a and gmrzfp <dig>  were shown to be involved in abiotic or biotic stress response pathways that have been previously published in chinese . these results indicate that the intt system is an effective and accurate method that can be used to screen for nuclear-targeted proteins and to monitor treatment-induced protein expression. currently, we are also developing another method combining ntt and suppression subtractive hybridization  <cit>  for screening biotic and abiotic treatment-induced nucleoproteins.

to date, few genes have been functionally characterized in rye. in this study, we observed that the expression levels of four nuclear proteins were more than 10-fold higher after 5 h cold treatment, and they were selected for further analyses. sct <dig> overexpression in transgenic plants enhanced freezing tolerance , whereas sct <dig> overexpression in transgenic plants enhanced extreme temperature tolerance . sct <dig> is a member of the heat shock protein  family, and hsp-like genes have been isolated from several plant species and are widely involved in the response to various biological and abiotic stresses, including low and high temperatures, drought, high salinity, exposure to disease and pests, and sa and abscisic acid  treatments  <cit> . the overexpression of sct <dig> in transgenic plants enhanced heat-stress tolerance  but not low-temperature tolerance . therefore, specific knowledge is required to further understand how hsp-like proteins enter into the nucleus and affect plant tolerance of heat stress. myb transcription factors comprise the largest transcription factor family in plants. members of this family play key roles in plant development, secondary metabolism, hormone signal transduction, disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . sct <dig>  overexpression in transgenic arabidopsis resulted in enhanced cold tolerance, consistent with previous studies, but not heat-stress tolerance . for example, overexpressing osmyb3r <dig> led to stronger cold tolerance and an increased mitotic index in transgenic rice  <cit> , and enhanced freezing-stress tolerance was observed in arabidopsis overexpressing osmyb <dig>  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis expressing atmyb <dig> exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous aba and improved drought and cold tolerance  <cit> . these results show that sct <dig> and sct <dig> can play important roles in the heat and cold response responses of arabidopsis and might be valuable for further research to improve tolerance to heat and cold stresses in other crops.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the newly intt system was developed by integrating an improved ntt system and the “after suppression subtraction” method. the results suggest that intt system is an effective method for identifying nucleartargeted proteins and monitoring their induced expression levels, particularly for species for which genomic sequence information is currently unavailable. sct <dig> and sct <dig> overexpression can enhance high-temperature and freezing-stress tolerances in transgenic plants, respectively. sct <dig> and sct <dig> might be good candidate genes for improving the stress tolerance of plants by genetic transformation.
