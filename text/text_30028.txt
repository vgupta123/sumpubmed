BACKGROUND
plants synthesize a wide array of metabolites, and a major goal of metabolomics is to identify natural plant metabolites and their associated functions . recent advances facilitating identification of metabolites  <cit>  have led to identification of groups of metabolites that correlate with important plant traits, such as growth rate and biomass  <cit> , and identified metabolic regulators such as leucine  <cit> . however, how specific metabolites other than characterized hormones function in signaling and development is largely unknown. one approach to learning about alternate signaling molecules is to study mutants with signaling-related defects.

the arabidopsis bypass <dig>  mutant might be an important tool for identifying a metabolite functioning as a long-distance signal. the bps <dig> mutant produces small abnormal roots and shoot development arrests soon after germination. this phenotype is linked to a mobile substance as the bps <dig> mutant root is necessary to induce arrest of bps <dig> shoots, and in graft chimeras, the bps <dig> root is sufficient to induce arrest of the wild-type shoot  <cit> . these observations led to a model featuring bps <dig> as a negative regulator that was required to prevent the excess production of a mobile substance. the mobile compound appears to be novel, and its synthesis requires carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . the pathway producing the bps <dig> mobile compound appears to be conserved in plant lineages, as knock-downs of conserved bps-like genes in tobacco produced similar phenotypes  <cit> . critical questions include whether this mobile compound is an endogenous developmental regulator, and how it modifies shoot growth.

control over shoot branching by a root-derived signal has been elegantly analyzed in pea, rice, and arabidopsis  <cit> . in these systems, mutations disrupting biosynthetic enzymes lead to reduced production of a mobile compound that controls auxin transport in the shoot  <cit> . recently, this substance was identified as strigolactone  <cit> . additional unknown root-to-shoot signals have been implicated by studies of drought , soil compaction  <cit> , nutrient depletion  <cit>  and low-fluence uv-b light  <cit> . the identities of the mobile compounds elicited by these treatments are unknown; it is also unknown whether the bps <dig> mobile substance is related to any of these pathways, but its root-to-shoot mobility make it an attractive candidate.

it is also possible that the bps <dig> mobile compound could instead be an intermediate molecule that normally doesn't accumulate. for example, a biosynthetic pathway might be blocked in bps <dig> mutants, resulting in build-up of a precursor that happens to be mobile, and happens to have biological activity. for example, in superroot <dig> mutants, a defect in glucosinolate biosynthesis causes a build-up of precursors that spills over into auxin biosynthesis, resulting in a high-auxin phenotype  <cit> .

here, we evaluate the conditions under which bps <dig> roots produce the mobile compound, and the characteristics of shoots undergoing arrest from this substance. we find that bps <dig> roots produce and transport the mobile substance in actively growing roots, but that arrest of cell division leads to cessation of signaling to the shoot. shoot responses include growth cessation, and in particular, arrest of cell division.

RESULTS
the bps <dig> root: shoot growth inhibition requires root growth
the central feature of bps <dig> mutants is that a growth-arresting mobile compound arises in the root  <cit> . however, the experimental basis for this assignment required wounding, and it was only tested in very young seedlings. to expand our understanding of the root's role in producing the bps <dig> signal, we examined how leaf development responded when bps <dig> root growth and development was blocked after embryogenesis. post-embryonic root growth and development requires glutathione . root development can therefore be blocked by either supplying germinating seeds with l-buthionine sulfoximine , an inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, or by generating double mutants between bps <dig> and root meristemless1- <dig> , which has a defect in the gene encoding γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and lacks post-embryonic root development  <cit> .

in agreement with previous publications, the roots of bso-treated wild type appeared to arrest development at germination. in addition, these plants produced small, but flattened, leaves with distinct blade and petiole, a modest reduction in leaf vein pattern, and bleached cotyledons . by contrast, bps <dig> mutants grown on bso-supplemented medium produced leaves with two distinct shapes . the first leaf pair was small, radially symmetric, and contained only a single unbranched vein, while subsequently produced leaves were broad, flat, showed distinct blade and petiole, and contained both primary and secondary veins. this partial rescue of leaf development in bso-treated bps <dig> mutants suggested that post-germination arrest of the bps <dig> root led to reduced synthesis of the root mobile signal.

similarly, the roots of rml1- <dig> mutants appeared to arrest development at germination, and they produced small, flattened leaves with distinct blade and petiole . growth of rml1- <dig> mutants on gsh-supplemented medium restored post-embryonic root growth, as reported previously  <cit>  . the bps <dig> single mutants and f <dig> seedlings derived from rml1-1/+ bps1-2/+ parents, grown on gsh-supplemented media, were indistinguishable from bps <dig> controls . by contrast, f <dig> seedlings derived from rml1-1/+ bps1-2/+ parents grown on standard growth medium , segregated for four different phenotypes: wild type; rml1-1; bps1-2; and a phenotype similar to bso-grown bps <dig> mutants . this last phenotype appeared at numbers consistent with it being the rml1- <dig> bps1- <dig> double mutant . as with rml1- <dig>  the bps <dig> rml1- <dig> double mutants produced roots that showed no sign of post-embryonic cell divisions. however, their first pair of leaves were radial and contained a single unbranched vein; these were similar to the bps <dig> single mutant, but much longer . strikingly, leaf  <dig> and subsequently produced leaves were broad and flattened, with distinct petiole and blade, and contained both primary and secondary veins, much like the leaves of rml1- <dig> single mutants and bso-treated bps <dig> . thus, these data indicate that post-embryonic root growth and development is required for continuous production and delivery of the leaf-arresting substance and further support the root as the source of this molecule  <cit> .

because imposing a gsh deficit  led to partial rescue of the bps <dig> shoot phenotype, it was a formal possibility that the bps <dig> root-derived compound could be gsh itself. to test this, we supplied gsh to excised bps <dig> shoots, and monitored subsequent leaf development. typically, root excision leads to partially rescued shoot development in approximately 75% of bps <dig> single mutants  <cit> . we reasoned that if the mobile signal was gsh, supplying it to bps <dig> mutants following root excision would reduce the number of bps <dig> mutants that were rescued by root excision. however, supplying gsh did not diminish shoot developmental rescue, and no regimen of gsh provision  yielded a statistically significant reduction of developmental rescue. moreover, shoot rescue resulted in leaves reaching similar sizes, whether or not excised shoots were supplemented with gsh . these data indicated that the mobile compound was not gsh.

** the number of plants that produce leaves under gsh+/gsh+ conditions is statistically greater than the number that produces leaves under gsh-/gsh-conditions .

arrested roots provide a transient source of the bps <dig> signal
arrest of post-embryonic root growth in bps <dig> caused strikingly different responses in the first leaf pair as compared to leaf three. both bso-grown bps <dig> mutants and rml <dig> bps <dig> double mutants initially produced a pair of radialized leaves, yet rescued development was observed in subsequently produced leaves . in addition, the rml1- <dig> bps1- <dig> first leaf pair was consistently larger than that of bso-grown bps1- <dig> mutants. these results contrast to root excision , where the strongest rescue was observed in the first leaf pair  <cit> , and suggest that the arrested bps <dig> root might be a transient source of the bps <dig> mobile compound.

we tested this possibility using the bps <dig> temperature dependent phenotype  <cit> . we compared the first leaf pair of bps <dig> rml1- <dig> double mutants grown at  <dig>   <dig>  and 29°c. for bps <dig> single mutants, leaf development is temperature dependent: severe arrest occurs at low temperatures, and small but flattened leaves are produced at high temperatures. thus, if the radialized first leaf pair of bps <dig> rml1- <dig> double mutants was due to the bps <dig> mobile signal, then we expected its development to be similarly dependent on growth temperature.

growth of bps <dig> rml <dig> double mutants at 16°c led to production of a narrow radially-shaped first leaf pair that was much longer than the bps1- <dig> control . in bps <dig> rml <dig> double mutants grown at 22°c, the first leaf pair was long, but very narrow. its narrowness was similar to the age-matched bps <dig> single mutant, but it was much longer. finally, in bps <dig> rml <dig> double mutants grown at 29°c, the first leaf pair was flattened and had a distinct blade, very similar to the bps <dig> control. the similar effects of growth temperature on the first leaf pair of bps <dig> single and bps <dig> rml <dig> double mutants indicates that the shape of the first leaf pair is due to the bps <dig> mobile root-derived compound. this suggests that the first leaf pair of bps <dig> rml <dig> double mutants was exposed to the root-derived compound, while the later-arising rescued leaves were not.

competence to synthesize and respond to the bps <dig> signal is retained in older seedlings
although the molecular target of the bps <dig> root-derived mobile compound is unknown, root-dependent arrest of early shoot development in bps <dig> seedlings indicates that the target is present at this early stage. however, we do not know if the molecular target is present later in development, nor do we know whether an older root retains the capacity to synthesize the mobile compound. to test this, we followed up on the observation that rml <dig> root development is rescued by supplying glutathione   <cit> . we reasoned that supplying gsh to an older bps <dig> rml <dig> double mutant might restore growth of a bps1-like root. if this root retained the ability to synthesize and deliver the mobile compound, and its molecular target was present in older shoots, then we would expect to observe arrested leaf growth.

seeds segregating for both bps <dig> and rml1- <dig> were plated on standard growth media, and at  <dig> days,  <dig> seedlings with rml <dig> root phenotype were transferred to gsh-supplemented medium . at  <dig> days after transfer , we analyzed their phenotypes. most of the plants looked the same as rml1- <dig> controls; they produced normal-appearing roots and large flat leaves . however,  <dig> of the seedlings produced roots that were short, blunt, and very swollen, and had produced lateral roots somewhat similar to bps <dig>  these plants also produced shoots with variable leaf shapes. their first leaf pair was long and radial, the subsequently produced 5- <dig> leaves appeared flat , and with distinct petiole and blades. finally, the newest arising leaves were short and radially shaped . this range of leaf phenotypes is consistent with restored synthesis and delivery of the bps <dig> mobile compound upon induction of root growth, and response in these later-arising vegetative leaves. these results indicate that roots retain the capacity to synthesize and deliver the bps <dig> mobile substance to the shoot, and that the shoots of older seedlings retain the ability to respond.

the bps <dig> mobile compound: synthesis and delivery require neither the phloem nor endodermis
we next developed double mutants that combined bps <dig> with altered phloem development , shortroot , and scarecrow  mutants. the apl mutant lacks phloem, shr lacks endodermis, and scr replaces endodermal and cortical cell layers with a single layer of mixed identity  <cit> . we predicted that if the phloem or endodermis were the sole site of synthesis of the bps <dig> mobile compound, or required for its transmission, then leaf development would be at least partially restored in the double mutants.

the bps <dig> apl double mutants showed an arrested shoot phenotype that was indistinguishable from bps <dig> , indicating that phloem was dispensable for synthesis and delivery of the bps <dig> mobile compound, at least in these very small mutants. similarly, both shr bps <dig> and scr bps <dig> double mutants resembled the bps <dig> single mutant . taken together, these data indicate that normal root development, including formation of the phloem and the endodermis, is not required for production and delivery of the bps <dig> signal.

shoot responses to the bps <dig> mobile root-derived compound
the reversible arrest of shoot development in bps <dig> mutants correlates with a loss of auxin responses  <cit> , but the underlying mechanism of arrest is unknown. to broaden our understanding of shoot responses in bps <dig>  we carried out a series of time-course analyses where we analyzed leaf size, shape, the distribution of dividing cells, and stress responses .

dividing cells were identified using the cycb1;1::gus reporter, a cell cycle reporter expressed in cells at the g2/m phase  <cit> . patterns of cycb1;1::gus expression in arabidopsis are well characterized; early leaf development shows a nearly uniform distribution of gus-staining  cells, while later in development cell divisions become restricted to the leaf base and provascular tissue  <cit>  . in bps <dig> mutants, the three-day leaf primordia largely matched wild type in terms of size, shape and cycb1;1::gus expression patterns, however there were pronounced differences by day four. the four-day wild type leaf was much larger than that of bps <dig> and cycb1;1::gus-staining cells were distributed throughout, while the small four-day bps1- <dig> leaf had only a few cycb1;1::gus-staining cells. at day five, the wild-type leaf started to show distinct lamina expansion, and a slight tendency for there to be more gus-staining cells toward its proximal end. by contrast, the five-day bps <dig> leaf showed no sign of lamina expansion, and few cycb1;1::gus-staining cells. the six-day wild-type leaf showed a strong reduction of cycb1;1::gus-staining cells at the distal end, and was much larger than the five-day wild-type leaf, while the corresponding bps <dig> leaf was largely unchanged. by day seven, the wild-type leaf was even larger and the few cycb1;1::gus expressing cells were at the leaf base. similarly, the bps <dig> seven-day leaf had only a few cycb1;1::gus-staining cells, and most were restricted to the leaf base. this analysis revealed a fully penetrant leaf arrest phenotype. in addition, despite the striking reduction in numbers of dividing cells, the apical/basal spatial control of cell divisions appeared to be intact.

while carrying out this analysis of leaf development, we also compared patterns of cycb1;1::gus-staining in roots . in the wild type, cycb1;1::gus-staining patterns were restricted to the root meristem, as has been described previously  <cit> , and a similar pattern was observed between days three and seven. by contrast, at all time points, the bps <dig> root had fewer cycb1;1::gus-staining cells.

the bps <dig> mutant analysis revealed occasional necrotic lesions on bps <dig> cotyledons . to assess a possible relationship between these lesions and leaf arrest, we carried out another time-course analysis, this time examining wild type and bps <dig> mutants for necrotic lesion formation. in bps <dig> mutants, necrotic lesions began to appear between  <dig> and  <dig> days. they were restricted to cotyledons, and never observed on leaves, hypocotyls, or roots, and necrotic lesions were never observed on the wild type  . more bps1- <dig> seedlings formed necrotic lesions than bps1- <dig>  and by day  <dig>  92% of the bps1- <dig> plants had at least one necrotic lesion. the average lesion number per plant was highly variable, and increased over time ; by day  <dig> the bps1- <dig> mutants had between zero and seven necrotic lesions. both bps1- <dig> and bps1- <dig> are null alleles  <cit> , and so we attribute the difference in lesion formation to their genetic backgrounds .

because lesion formation is typically preceded by reactive oxygen species   <cit> , we compared ros in bps <dig> and wild type shoots using diaminobenzadine  to assay for hydrogen peroxide  and nitroblue tetrazolium  to assay for superoxide. because the bps1- <dig> allele showed a more robust necrotic lesion phenotype, these analyses used bps1- <dig> and l. er. both staining procedures produced a strong reaction in the vascular tissue, consistent with a role for ros in lignification  <cit> . we found h2o <dig> in the 14-day bps <dig> cotyledons, typically in positions surrounding the developing necrotic lesions , but did not observe any nonvascular staining in the wild type cotyledon . additionally, we did not detect h2o <dig> in bps <dig> leaves. similarly, superoxide was primarily associated with vascular tissue in wild type leaves, and it was nearly absent from the leaves of bps <dig> mutants . because accumulation patterns of these two ros were similar for the wild type and bps <dig> mutants, severe oxidative stress does not appear to cause the bps <dig> leaf developmental arrest.

discussion
physiological studies have implicated long distance signaling as a link between the development and physiology of roots and shoots  <cit> . however, only a small number of long-distance signaling pathways have been verified molecularly. in arabidopsis bps <dig> mutants, the non-cell-autonomous activity of mutant roots suggests that bps <dig> might function to limit the synthesis of a root-derived mobile signaling molecule  <cit> .

capacity to synthesize the bps <dig> mobile compound
a central feature of bps <dig> mutants is that the root is the source of a biologically active mobile compound, which we refer to as the bps <dig> signal. here, we extended our understanding of the conditions under which the mutant root produces this compound. previously we showed that cutting off the root led to rescue of the first leaf pair  <cit> . indeed, we have now found that arresting post-embryonic bps <dig> root growth also resulted in rescue of leaf development. however, in contrast to root excision, the first leaf pair was only mildly rescued, and strong rescue was delayed until leaf three. these observations indicate that the bps <dig> root, despite post-embryonic arrest, retained a transient ability to supply the bps <dig> signal to the shoot.

we used two related approaches to arrest post-embryonic root growth: we caused arrest through the depletion of gsh either genetically  or chemically . in both cases, the first leaf pair in gsh-depleted bps <dig> was larger than that of untreated bps <dig> mutants, and the first leaf pair of bps <dig> rml1- <dig> double mutants were consistently larger than that of bso-grown bps <dig>  here, a larger leaf size probably reflects an earlier block to gsh synthesis in the mutant, and therefore an earlier reduction in bps <dig> signal synthesis.

similarly, we found that restoring development of bps <dig> roots  reinstated arrest of leaf development. the extended capacity to produce and respond to the mobile compound is in line with physiological studies of drought-evoked long distance signaling, which has been documented in diverse plants, and at varying developmental stages  <cit> .

a possibly less obvious question is why growth-arrested roots  show a decreased ability to arrest shoot growth. one possibility is that bps <dig> signal synthesis has a direct requirement for gsh. alternatively, either synthesis or transmission to the shoot requires active root growth and cell division.

the maintenance of shoot arrest in apl bps <dig> double mutants is consistent with a link to root growth. although apl mutants have determinate roots  <cit> , growth ceases later than for rml1- <dig> or bso-treated plants, and the apl bps <dig> analysis was carried out prior to evidence of root cell division arrest. however, if root growth is a requirement for bps <dig> signal synthesis, then we would need to be able to explain constitutive synthesis of bps <dig> signal in bps <dig> mutants, which show primary root arrest soon after germination. one possibility is that synthesis is sustained by lateral roots, which initiate repeatedly. alternatively, bps <dig> roots  expand radially, and this radial growth might also sustain synthesis of the bps <dig> signal.

bps <dig> signal transmission
movement of the bps <dig> signal from the root to the shoot is likely to use the plant's vascular system. two vascular tissues are specialized for long-distance movement: the phloem, which transports photosynthate, and also mrnas and proteins; and the xylem, which primarily transports water and dissolved nutrients. here, we found that the shoot undergoes arrest in bps <dig> apl double mutants, which lack phloem  <cit> . the simplest conclusion is that the bps <dig> signal moves in the xylem. however, this conclusion is not definitive, because the very small size of bps <dig> apl double mutants doesn't preclude movement by diffusion.

shoot responses to the mobile bps <dig> signal
the small leaf size and reduced number of cycb1;1::gus expressing cells are a fully penetrant bps <dig> phenotype. strikingly, although reduced in number, the pattern of cycb1;1::gus-expressing cells mimicked the wild type pattern: leaf primordia showed an even distribution of diving cells, but as the mutant leaves matured, dividing cells were restricted to the base of the leaf. the retention of a normal pattern of dividing cells shows that some aspects of leaf developmental programming persist in bps <dig> mutants. this result hints that instead of altering development, the bps <dig> signal might instead disrupt the link between development and cell cycle control.

another phenotype in bps <dig> mutants is the formation of necrotic lesions. these were late-appearing and not fully penetrant. necrotic lesions have been observed in a wide range of arabidopsis mutants. these include plants with defects in syntaxin genes  <cit> , and mutants with defects in the cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp83b <dig>  which results in excess auxin synthesis  <cit> . necrosis is typically associated with plant defense responses, and can be a secondary consequence of elevated expression of defense genes, such as observed in the developmental mutant asymmetric leaf  <dig>  <cit>  and in response to phosphate deficiency  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here support the phenomenon of shoot arrest by a root-derived molecule in bps <dig> mutants. a key question raised by discovery and characterization of this mutant is whether the bps <dig> mutation exposes a novel root-to-shoot signaling molecule or a metabolic intermediate with toxic effects on shoot development. the crucial difference between these two concepts is that a novel root-to-shoot signaling molecule would be present in the wild type, while a metabolic intermediate would only accumulate in bps <dig> mutants. because the synthesis of the root-derived molecule requires post-embryonic root development and aerial organs appear to arrest growth prior to showing any signs of toxicity , we tend to favor the hypothesis that bps <dig> reveals a novel root-to-shoot signaling pathway. a full resolution of this issue awaits biochemical identification of this mobile molecule. regardless of the nature of the root-derived compound, it should be pointed out that under either scenario the bps <dig> mutation has unveiled a molecule with potent biological activity. despite the impact of root-to-shoot communication on plant productivity, the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. the bps <dig> mutation could be utilized as a tool to begin to dig into the pathways that both synthesize and respond to root-derived growth modulators.
