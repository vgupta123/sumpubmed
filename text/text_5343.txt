BACKGROUND
many genetic studies of sub-saharan y chromosome variation have paid special attention to the large-scale bantu expansions, and the particular pool of the "relic" central african pygmies and the south african khoisan  <cit> , while little is known about the events that have shaped the paternal structure of equatorial west africans. although anthropological evidence is scarce, the earliest traces of west atlantic occupation by modern humans dates back  <dig> ky  <cit> . later climatic changes, when around  <dig> kya the sahara was at its wettest  <cit> , created conditions for both the massive displacement of people and the spread of agriculture, reaching previously uninhabited areas and promoting admixture with isolated populations  <cit> . although the farming practices in sahel could have started earlier than  <dig> kya  <cit> , firm archaeological evidence points to the domestication of local sorghum, millet and yams ~ <dig> kya  <cit> . together with the introduction of iron-smelting techniques ~ <dig>  kya, agriculture led ultimately to the large-scale bantu migrations from the gulf of guinea to the south of the continent  <cit> . from the perspective of y chromosome genetic variation, such movements are believed to have erased much of the pre-existing diversity, replacing it with the now dominant haplogroup e3a-m <dig> lineages  <cit> .

the inhabitants of the guinea-bissau area have certainly been under the influence of several demographic events since prehistorical times, as a result of migratory movements, trade networks and consecutive invasions. the first recorded influx of ethnically defined groups is the arrival of fulbe people in the 8th century ad, from a central african epicenter  <cit> . first contact with the north african berbers dates back to at least the 9th century, and was repeated in the 11th century when, pushed by the omníades, these people came to occupy the vicinity of senegal  <cit> . the economic shift in the sahel allowed more centralized states to form , linked by a trading corridor reaching from mauritania to niger  <cit> . in the following centuries pastoral fulbe arrived again slowly but en masse, together with the mandenka, and became the most prevalent people in guinea-bissau territory. oral tradition also states that the djola people – felupe-djola, baiote and possibly beafada – came from sudan in the 15th-16th centuries  <cit> . as for the balanta, sudanese or bantu affinities may argue for their cultural and phenotypic aspects. though research on the background of the nalú is less advanced, teixeira da mota  <cit>  considers them to be the autochthonous people of the region. the same author identifies bijagós as a separated branch of djola or relatives of papel and nalú. the main ethnic groups now present in guinea-bissau  were already settled in the region in the 15th century, at the time of arrival of the portuguese. with the establishment of the atlantic slave trade the region experienced an input of europeans, in their vast majority males, whose genetic imprint is undetermined. many of the ethnic barriers were brought down, in particular the endogamic practices, promoting an intense cultural contact and higher levels of admixture between groups than before.

the present study intends to characterize the paternal genetic pool of guineans, focusing on their ethnic affiliation, by the use of binary markers and microsatellites on the non-recombining region of the y chromosome . our sample  extends significantly the y-chromosomal coverage of west african populations  both in size and number of surveyed ethnic groups. the unique features of the y chromosome system, namely its haploid and non-recombining nature and paternal inheritance, provide an opportunity to evaluate the temporal and spatial aspects of population movements, in the light of the available non-genetic evidence.

RESULTS
y chromosome haplogroup variation
the fairly homogeneous paternal structure of guinea-bissau , is not surprising given the general landscape of sub-saharan low y-chromosomal haplogroup diversity  <cit>  and its reported east-to-west decline along a central african corridor  <cit> . responsibility for the low diversity is attributed to the highly frequent e3a*-m <dig> and e1*-m <dig> lineages  that are shared among all ethnic clusters . in our dataset the mandenka harbor the highest frequency  of the e3a*-m <dig> paragroup, fitting the context of its closest neighbors . the lack of diversity of west african y chromosomes together with the predominance of e3a*-m <dig> lineages  reinforces its link to agricultural expansion  <cit>  and hint at the existence of a large local center of cultivation  <cit> . we hypothesized that the newly adopted lifestyle created conditions for major demographic growth, obscuring earlier patterns of lineages. alternatively, a moderate farming expansion may have occurred on a background of reduced diversity, following the  <dig>  kya savanna retreat  <cit>  or the malarial epidemic episodes which were an outcome of pastoral habits  <cit> .

the lifestyle transition in west africa was most likely promoted by people other than the bantu, as no relevant westwards migrations of these people are reported and none or few bantu languages are found in the area today. in fact, the west african center may date earlier than that documented for central africa and may have acted as a western source of knowledge  <cit> . based on the high frequency and microsatellite diversity of e3a*-m <dig> in the mandenka and balanta , we suggest that these people may have experienced a particular benefit from food production. if so, this might associate their ancestors with the people who implemented the farming habits in the guinea-bissau area. the mandenka are physically and culturally descendants of the mande, protagonists of agricultural population expansions in niger/mali/burkina-faso region  <cit>  and rulers of the west african black empires, based on trade and agriculture. for the balanta, the cultural and physical affinities with bantu suggest a common origin at the end of the pleistocene  <cit> , so it may be that different peoples jointly learnt the agricultural techniques. the e3a7-m <dig> lineages of one fulbe and two mandenka individuals of guinea-bissau are undoubtedly representatives of a central african lineage that followed a trajectory to the west  <cit> .

haplogroup e1*-m <dig>  of probable local radiation , is surprisingly frequent in felupe-djola and papel . both ethnic groups exhibit the highest haplogroup diversity  and the deepest-rooting phylogenetic types in our dataset – haplogroups a-m <dig>  e2-m <dig> and e3*-pn <dig> – some with occasional occurrences in fulbe and balanta . these minor imprints may represent movements from sahel's more central and eastern parts, seen, for example, in the typically ethiopian/sudanese e3*-pn <dig> lineages that have reached senegambia  <cit> . the djola's oral tradition claims an arrival from sudan in the 15th-16th centuries which is supported by their carrying the lowest fraction of e3a* in our dataset . at the same time, the relatively short time of residence and/or the genetic isolation on cultural grounds has not contributed to a greater homogeneity among the peoples. the papel, curiously also affiliated to the bak-speakers, may either represent a legacy left by earlier inhabitants of the guinean delta, survivors of an ancient pool through demographic reductions and expansions, or later arrivers who have preserved a more discrete genetic identity.

of greater prevalence in the east quadrant of africa and among south african khoisan  the paragroup e3b*-m <dig> is common to felupe-djola and papel  but is also found among fulbe and mandenka . its presence at ~2% in guinea-bissau and ~5% in senegal may also indicate loose relationships to the north, where it is widespread at rather low frequencies , not to mention the ~7% in the near eastern and european people  <cit> . in guinea-bissau this haplogroup attains the highest frequency so far reported for west africa .

the remainder of binary marker variation falls into haplogroups a, b and r, each detected at marginal frequencies . clades a-m <dig> and b-m <dig>  the most divergent of the haplogroups of the y chromosome tree, are associated with the earliest modern human diversification and are putative markers of the first pan-african dispersals of hunter-gatherers  <cit> . however, the guinea-bissau a-m <dig> lineages do not belong to the widespread a3-m <dig> but to the a1-m <dig> subcluster, with reported marginal presence in mali , gambia/senegal mandinka  and north african berbers . any association of balanta to the sudanese-speakers is traceable only in the a3b2-m <dig> and e3* y chromosomes. the b-m <dig> variant observed in almost all sub-saharan collections  <cit>  was only found in nalú. one other nalú individual belongs to the rare and deep-rooting de* paragroup described in five nigerians  <cit>  and thus representing a coalescent "missing link", paraphyletic to haplogroups d and e. the two western european r1b-p <dig> lineages in fulbe and bijagós are best explained by recent european influence, at the time of the slave trade. a partial introduction through north african pastoral immigrants can not be rejected, where the 3–12% of r1b-p <dig> are due to the geographic proximity and the long reported contacts with europe and middle-east  <cit> . the european source seems nevertheless more likely: firstly, y chromosome signatures of european presence have a reported great expression in the nearby cape verdians  <cit>  and secondly, highly frequent north african haplogroups that would have been equally carried by the migrants  are absent in guineans. the m <dig> and p <dig> derived states in both our samples rule out a relationship to the r1*-m <dig> lineage previously found in cameroon, oman, egypt and rwanda, and adduced to support the "back-to-africa" theory  <cit> .

pairwise fst analysis of haplogroup frequencies reveals the felupe-djola as the only group statistically significantly different from others, namely bijagós , fulbe  and mandenka . the exact test of population differentiation reveals similar information, further distinguishing papel from bijagós , fulbe  and mandenka . these results are in agreement with principal components analysis  and the interpretation of the greater distinctiveness of the paternal pool of felupe-djola and papel among other guineans.

pca and amova analysis
a pca of guinean and other african populations y chromosome haplogroup frequencies is depicted in figure 4a . the 1st pc clearly separates the afro-asiatic speakers from other linguistic families, independently of their geographic location. consistent with geographical grouping, north and west africans cluster in independent and tighter groups. the coordinates of north africans are attributable to haplogroups e3b2-m <dig> and j-12f <dig> while west africans' y chromosomes cluster largely due to e3a*-m <dig>  and e1-m <dig> to a lesser extent. central and south african people are more dispersed in the plot, many lying closer to the eastern populations  while others lie closer to the western cluster. a linguistic correlation is hypothesized to underlie the genetic proximity of bantu-speakers occupying different quadrants of the continent, driven by the e3a7-m <dig>  guinea-bissau groups are included in the western cluster of populations, in close vicinity to gambia/senegal wolof and mandinka  <cit>  and senegalese  <cit>  with which they share numerous population groups. it is noteworthy that the guinea-bissau fulbe show a distinct pool from other fulbe people, namely the ones in burkina-faso and cameroon, and are integrated within the guinea-bissau variation. a pca of guinea-bissau ethnic groups is illustrated in figure 4b, less biased by the major influence of haplogroup e3a*-m <dig> and where the influence of minor clusters is emphasized. the felupe-djola and papel have distinctive positions, largely a result of the high frequency of haplogroup e1-m <dig>  the bijagós, inhabitants of the archipelago, are placed apart in closer relation to the mainland fulbe. the position of mandenka is clearly defined by its e3a*-m <dig> composition.

the amova yielded no statistically significant results for ethnic group distinction on any of the defined criteria, with ~97% of the variance occurring at the within-population level . these results suggest that in spite of obvious sociocultural differences among groups, marked by the supposedly strict admixture barriers, their y chromosome gene pool remains largely shared, because of common origin or common history of genetic admixture without language shift.

microsatellite haplotypes within haplogroups
y-chromosomal microsatellites provide further haplotype resolution, and are of particular use when, as in this case, some haplogroups are very prevalent. the e3a*-m <dig> microsatellite profiles of mandenka and balanta are the most diverse among our data  and attest to an earlier origin or more pronounced expansion. since the corresponding parameter in fulbe is less diverse we consider this to signal either a genetic bottleneck or their more recent expansion and late arrival in the west. the data are consistent with the less diverse e3a-m <dig> profile in central and south africans . haplotypes within e3b1-m <dig> are supposed to represent distinct clusters of local genetic drift  <cit> . the rare dys <dig> allele  <dig> of a so-called e3b1-β cluster particularly widespread among moroccan arabs defines a contribution to the guinean fulbe and bijagós from north west africans who have crossed the sahara. the hypothesis of much later european contribution is valid though the remaining variability is absent  and none of the guinean haplotypes carry the a <dig>  allele with size  <dig>  characteristic of europe  <cit> . microsatellite networks for paragroup e3a*-m <dig> and haplogroup e3b1-m <dig> are not informative due to multiple reticulations and the absence of a clear haplotype sub-structure particularly associated to ethnic groups . further refinement awaits the finding of new markers especially within paragroup e3a*-m <dig>  the microsatellite profile of the de* individual is one mutational step away from the allelic state described for nigerians  supporting their broad distribution. the mandenka share e3a*-m <dig> variants with all other groups in guinea-bissau and do not match types outside central-west africa , a sign of localized expansion and increased influence over their ethnic neighbors. the felupe-djola, balanta and papel each share one microsatellite haplotype  with mozambique and angola. several e3a* eight-loci profiles matched europeans , most likely descendants of incoming slaves. three fulbe e3b1-m <dig> haplotypes  were found to match spanish haplotypes  <cit>  and samples in central portugal, macedonia, romania and poland . both profiles present the a <dig>  allele  <dig>  quite frequent in equatorial guinea  <cit> . the r1b-p <dig> h <dig> has a 10-loci haplotype found in  <dig> worldwide populations, of which  <dig> are european . the picture for h166-r1b is quite different since on a 7-loci basis it matches four europeans and two individuals from the reunion islands, known to have a european-permeable culture.

mtdna haplogroup variation
comparisons between mtdna and y-chromosomal diversity are hindered because of the very different mutational properties of their snps and y microsatellites, and because of snp ascertainment bias on the y chromosome. therefore, caution is needed when interpreting the results.

the maternal inheritance of guineans is markedly west african, with haplogroups coalescing at distinct timeframes, from the initial occupation of the area to the later inputs of people  <cit> . of relevance for comparison with the paternal counterpart are the signatures of recent expansion in haplogroups frequent in senegambia, namely haplogroups l2a-l2c, the latter displaying an almost starlike phylogeny and being particularly frequent in the mandenka . an intriguing increased frequency of l0a <dig> in the balanta might parallel a1-m <dig> and a3b2-m <dig> y chromosomes in representing east african traces. although the founder l0a <dig> haplotype is shared in an east-to-west corridor, the emerging lineages are exclusive of guineans, indicating a rapid spread and local expansion after arrival. these may therefore reflect the arrival of their ancestors in the holocene . moreover, the exact matches found between balanta and north africans in haplogroups l2a, l2b and l3b may represent evidence for their contact and long residence in the territory. l3e <dig> lineages, thought to signal the western expansion of food-production and iron-smelting, show a moderate frequency of 8% in the balanta. the absence of mtdna bantu-markers  <cit>  suggests either that bantu people contributed very little to the maternal gene pool of guineans, or that they had a different pool from that associated with the southwards migrations  <cit> .

the widespread l3e2b is mainly a felupe-djola and papel cluster with probable links to their homeland mirrored in exact matches with east and central african haplotypes. lineages within l3h, coalescing at the late pleistocene/early holocene in guineans  <cit> , exhibit one of the highest found frequencies among the felupe-djola . their increased frequency of west african mtdna haplogroups l2b and l3d and y chromosome e1*-m <dig> could be due to amplification in small founder groups, as these are absent in east africa.

the mtdna haplotypes in guinean fulbe exhibit a wide range of matches supported by their wide distribution and massive movements in recent history . the high frequency of l1b is otherwise a constant in the fulbe "world"  <cit> . conversely to what is seen on the paternal side, this is the only group that retains statistically significant differences in mtdna lineages from its ethnic neighbors. as for the y chromosome, the mtdna pool of bijagós shows higher affinity to that of fulbe, making less likely any connections to the djola, papel or nalú  <cit> .

the north african mtdna haplogroups demonstrates partial diffusion to sahel, namely u <dig> found in fulbe and mandenka and m1b present in guinea-bissau atlantic bak-speakers . the u5b1b lineages in fulbe and papel are representatives of a link between the scandinavian saami and the north african berbers, emphasizing the great importance of post-glacial expansions  <cit> . these lineages have most likely crossed the strait of gibraltar and developed into local clusters, one of which is in west africa. they do not seem to result from recent gene flow given that the north african euroasiatic haplogroups h, j and t are absent in our sample.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of our data provides further evidence for the homogeneity of the y chromosome gene pool of sub-saharan west africans, due to the high frequency of haplogroup e3a-m <dig>  its frequency and diversity in west africa are among the highest found, suggesting an early local origin and expansion in the last 20– <dig> ky. hypothesizing on the existence of an important local agricultural centre, this could have supported a demographic expansion, on an e3a-m <dig> background, that almost erased the pre-existing y chromosome diversity. its pattern of diversity within mandenka and balanta hints at a more marked populational growth, these people possibly related to the local diffusion of agricultural expertise. the papel and felupe-djola people retain traces of their east african relatives, to which the short timescale of residence in guinea-bissau and higher isolation from major influences have contributed. in the near absence of archaeological data, the signatures of north, central and east africans, traceable in less frequent extant paternal haplogroups, fit well with the linguistic and historical evidence regarding the origin and admixture processes of particular ethnic groups. minor influences of north and east africa, in particular, are corroborated by mtdna data.
