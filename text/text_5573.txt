BACKGROUND
wild plants are usually consistently exposed to various environmental challenges such as drought, high salinity, extreme temperature, heavy metals and pathogen infections, which affect their growth and development. to adapt to these unpredictable environmental stresses, plants have evolved signaling mechanisms to transmit stimuli to different cellular compartments and then respond to these stresses. accumulating evidence indicates that reversible protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases and phosphatases plays important roles in cellular stresses signal transduction in plants  <cit> . in the past decades, several protein kinases have been extensively investigated and proved to be positive regulation factors responding to a diversity of abiotic and biotic stresses . in contrast to the protein kinases, protein phosphatases are not well investigated.

protein phosphatases modify protein function by removing the phosphate group from phosphorylated proteins. they are divided into three major classes: tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases and dual-specificity phosphatases . according to distinct amino acid sequences, different dependencies on metal ions and sensitivities to inhibitors such as cyclosporine a and okadaic acid, protein serine/threonine phosphatases can be classified into the phosphor-protein phosphatases , phosphoprotein metallophosphatases  and aspartate-based protein phosphatases  <cit> . the ppp family includes type  <dig> , type 2a , type  <dig> , type  <dig> , type  <dig> , type  <dig>  and type 2b , whereas the ppm family is represented by the mg2+- or mn2+- dependent type-2c protein phosphatases   <cit> .

pp2cs, evolutionarily conserved and found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, are implicated in regulating stress-signaling pathways and act as negative modulators of protein kinase cascades activated by diverse stresses. for instance, a pp2c phosphatase, rsbp, in bacillus subtilis dephosphorylates rsbv  and mediates the regulation during energy stress  <cit> . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, pp2cs play a negative role in the signal-transduction process responding to osmotic stress by counteracting the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway  <cit> . furthermore, one of the human pp2cs was shown to inactivate the amp-activated protein kinase , a central component of the protein kinase cascade activated by atp depletion  <cit> . in higher plants such as arabidopsis, pp2c genes were demonstrated to regulate signaling pathways negatively by opposing the action of particular protein kinases. at least eight pp2cs from subgroup a in arabidopsis have been characterized as key factors in aba signaling transduction. briefly, subgroup a pp2cs inactivate snrk <dig> via dephosphorylation, and this inactivation is inhibited by aba receptors, pyr/pyl/rcra, in an aba-dependent manner  <cit> . the subgroup b pp2c, ap2c <dig>  interacts with mpk <dig> or mpk <dig> and subsequently suppresses mapk activities during wounding as well as pathogen stresses  <cit> . the subgroup c pp2c pol or pll <dig> interacts with the receptor kinase clv <dig>  inducing and maintaining stem cell polarity  <cit> . the subgroup e pp2c atpp2c6- <dig> interacts with arabidopsis histone acetyl transferase gcn <dig> and controls the activation of stress-responsive genes in the stomatal signaling network . the subgroup f pp2c win <dig> may interact with the bacterial effector hopw1- <dig> and regulate hopw1-1-induced plant resistance  <cit> . the unclustered pp2c kapp interacts with different receptor-like protein kinases  and is predicted to control plant immunity responses or hormone signaling  <cit> . to date, there are  <dig> and  <dig> genes coding for pp2c proteins identified using bioinformatics surveys in arabidopsis and rice, respectively . however, few pp2c genes in monocots have been functionally investigated.

b. distachyon is a new model monocot for exploring the functional genomics of temperate grasses, cereals and biofuel crops. in  <dig>  the complete genome of the b. distachyon bd <dig> was sequenced and the sequence data can be easily obtained via the brachypodium genome resource   <cit> . to our knowledge, a genome-wide analysis of the pp2c gene family in b. distachyon has not been reported so far. here, we first identified  <dig> pp2cs based on phosphatase domains analysis. then, we further examined whether all phosphatase domains of bdpp2c members harbored magnesium/manganese ions  coordination residues through protein structural analysis. we also investigated bdpp2c genes chromosomal localization, constructed the phylogenetic tree of all bdpp2c genes based on their pp2c domains and categorized them into  <dig> subgroups. subsequently, we analyzed the duplication events contributing to the expansion and functional divergences of the bdpp2c gene family. in addition, we examined the expression profiles of bdpp2c genes in different tissues and their responses to different phytohormone treatments as well as various abiotic and biotic stresses. our results provide a foundation for future functional analysis of the pp2c gene family in stress responses in b. distachyon.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification and characterization of bdpp2c genes
protein phosphatase pp2cs are evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . during the evolution from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes, the number of pp2c genes increased from one member to as many as  <dig> members. in previous reports, one pp2c member in thermococcus, three in synechocaccus, four in bacillus, seven in saccharomyces,  <dig> in chlamydomonas,  <dig> in physcomitrella,  <dig> in selaginella,  <dig> in arabidopsis,  <dig> in oryza and ~ <dig> in zea mays were characterized  <cit> . the increase and expansion of pp2c genes from archaea to higher plants may correlate with adaptations to complex environmental conditions for plants. to identify pp2c candidate genes in b. distachyon, the interpro pp2c domain “ipr001932” was used to search the plaza <dig>  database  and  <dig> putative pp2c genes were found. by using pfam and smart domain identification tools, we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> putative pp2c genes lacked pp2c catalytic domains. therefore,  <dig> genes in b. distachyon were identified as pp2c family members. the  <dig> bdpp2c genes identified in this study encode proteins varying from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, with large variations in isoelectric point  values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and molecular weight from 30 kda to 120 kda. the subcellular localization prediction indicated that most of the bdpp2c proteins might be located in cytoplasm, chloroplast or nucleus, while only a few might be located in cytoskeleton or mitochondria . a total of  <dig> pp2c genes were anchored to corresponding chromosomes and designated as bdpp2c1–bdpp2c <dig> according to their order on the chromosomes.table  <dig> list of  <dig> bdpp2c genes and their basic characterizations

the pp2c phosphatase catalytic domain has been reported to harbor  <dig> conserved motifs, in which  <dig> conserved residues contribute to mg2+/mn2+ coordination  <cit> . so we further checked if bdpp2cs’ phosphatase catalytic domain harbored  <dig> conserved motifs. the result obtained from multiple alignments of the  <dig> bdpp2c domains indicated that not all of the bdpp2c members contained all of the  <dig> conserved motifs. for example, bradi1g <dig>  bradi3g <dig>  bradi3g <dig> and bradi2g <dig> were found to be partial deletions in the c-terminal of pp2c phosphatase catalytic domain, thus probably resulting in elimination of a few important motifs and loss of functions. further analysis showed that scattered amino acid residues also existed among conserved motifs in several bdpp2c members, which suggests that the amino acid composition of plant pp2c domains is quite complex . in addition, the 3-d structure prediction of  <dig> bdpp2c domains also showed the diversities of pp2c proteins . however, as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the residues contributing to mg2+/mn2+coordination in bdpp2cs are absolutely conserved. the conserved amino acid residues , ,  and   were found within motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the predicted protein tertiary structures further revealed that these  <dig> conserved residues were spatially clustered together in  <dig> bdpp2cs , except bradi1g <dig> and bradi1g <dig>  which were designated as noncanonical members .fig.  <dig> the predicted tertiary structure of bdpp2c domains showing their conserved mg2+/mn2+coordination sites in b. distachyon. the tertiary structures of bdpp2c domains were predicted using the phyre <dig> tool. the yellow regions indicated by white boxes represent conserved residues that contribute to mg2+/mn2+ coordination



phylogenetic, gene structural and protein domain analyses of bdpp2c
to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of pp2c genes between b. distachyon and other plants, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the alignments of pp2c domains in b. distachyon, arabidopsis and rice using the maximum likelihood  method. the phylogenetic analyses indicated that the  <dig> bdpp2c proteins were divided into  <dig> subfamilies , which is consistent with the pp2c groups found in arabidopsis and rice. each subfamily tree includes pp2c protein from b. distachyon, arabidopsis and rice . not surprisingly, the bdpp2c clustered together with those from rice because both b. distachyon and rice are monocots, while atpp2c tended to form independent branches. furthermore, the distributions of pp2cs in each subfamily were similar among b. distachyon, arabidopsis and rice except for the subgroups i and k , which suggests that the pp2c gene family has evolved from one common ancestor in the three plants. the other three members, i.e., bradi1g <dig>  bradi1g <dig> and bradi1g <dig>  grouped into a new clade, m. in addition, the remaining three members, i.e., bradi2g <dig>  bradi4g <dig> and bradi2g <dig>  did not cluster with any other group, and each of them formed a single branch .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of pp2c proteins among b. distachyon, arabidopsis and rice. alignments of  <dig> pp2c domains from b. distachyon, arabidopsis and rice were performed with clustalw <dig>  and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the ml method with mega  <dig> 




to determine the phylogenetic relationships among the bdpp2c proteins, we constructed a phylogenetic tree from the alignments of the  <dig> pp2c domains identified above. as shown in fig.  <dig> and fig. 3a, all of the bdpp2c proteins still remained in the same subfamily. because the pattern diversity of exon/intron structure and protein domain often plays an important role in the evolution of gene families, the patterns of exon/intron structure of bdpp2c genes and conserved domains were examined according to their phylogenetic relationships. the investigation of exon/intron structures revealed that the majority of members in the same subfamily shared similar exon numbers and different exon and intron lengths. however, three members in the m group, consisting of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exons, were largely distinct in exon/intron arrangements, although their phylogenetic relationship was supported by 100 % bootstrap value. more interestingly, almost all bdpp2cs lacking introns were members of the k subgroup, and the number of pp2c members in the k subgroup in b. distachyon was four or two times more than that in arabidopsis and rice, respectively . previous studies suggested that genes lacking introns would rapidly evolve via gene duplication events . therefore, the expansion of the bdpp2c k subfamily may be associated with gene duplication events.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship, gene structure and domain analysis of pp2cs in b. distachyon. a the phylogenetic tree was constructed from alignments of the  <dig> pp2c domains in b. distachyon using the ml method with mega  <dig> .  <dig> bdpp2c proteins were clustered into  <dig> groups , designated with different colors, except for three ungrouped members. b the exon/intron structure of each bdpp2c gene was proportionally displayed according to the scale at the bottom. yellow boxes represent exons, gray lines represent introns and blue boxes represent untranslated regions. c the distribution of conserved domains within bdpp2c proteins. the relative positions of each domain are shown in color boxes, with the name indicated on the right



when analyzing the phosphatase domains, we found that other domains were associated with the main pp2c domain, including s-tkc , fha  and cnb . as shown in fig. 3c, s-tkc was found in bradi3g <dig>  bradi4g <dig> and bradi2g40550; fha was identified in bradi1g <dig> and bradi1g04540; cnb was only present in bradi3g <dig>  however, the transmembrane region identified in atpp2cs and ospp2cs was not found in any bdpp2cs. the s-tkc or fha domains have been found in several arabidopsis and rice pp2c genes, including at2g <dig>  os01g <dig> and os11g <dig> or at5g <dig>  os03g <dig> and os07g <dig>  pp2cs with fha domain known as the kapp  were reported to play important roles in interacting with rlk and have been characterized as the first downstream negative regulator of rlk in plant development in arabidopsis  <cit> . hence, it would be interesting to investigate the different biological functions of bdpp2cs harboring these special domains.

chromosomal location and duplications of bdpp2c genes
to analyze the genomic distribution of bdpp2c genes, we marked their approximate position on each chromosome based on the information obtained from the brachypodium genome database. the results showed that all of the  <dig> bdpp2c genes were localized on five chromosomes and their distribution appeared to be uneven. further analysis indicated that the number of bdpp2c genes on each chromosome was proportional to the chromosome length.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bdpp2c genes were mapped on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . we also marked the densities of cpg islands on each chromosome. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the deeper color region on chromosomes represents the higher density of cpg islands; the gray or white region on chromosomes represents the lower density of cpg islands. we found that most of the bdpp2c genes were located on gray or white regions, indicating that they might be transcriptionally active.fig.  <dig> genomic distribution of bdpp2c genes on each chromosome.  <dig> bdpp2c genes were mapped onto specific chromosomes, and the number of bdpp2cs on each chromosome is indicated. the small green or red triangles show the direction of transcription for genes. the deeper color on the chromosomes’ region represents the higher density of cpg islands



during evolutionary processes, large segmental duplications and small-scale tandem duplications are two major mechanisms to generate new genes, which contribute to the genome complexities in the plant kingdom  <cit> . indeed, previous studies have reported that pp2c gene families mainly expanded through whole-genome and chromosomal segment duplications, both in rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . in b. distachyon, paralogous relationship analysis showed that six major chromosomal duplication events happened among the b. distachyon chromosomes, covering  <dig>  % of the whole genome  <cit> . closely related genes located within a distance of less than 200 kb on the same chromosome are defined as tandem duplications, otherwise they are segmental duplications  <cit> . according to this principle,  <dig> pairs of paralogous bdpp2c genes were found to be involved in segmental duplication events and no tandem duplication gene pairs were found in the bdpp2c family. analysis of these  <dig> pairs of segmental duplication bdpp2c genes showed that  <dig> were located in  <dig> major duplicated chromosomal blocks . amino acid alignment analysis indicated that two counterparts of each gene pair were from the same subgroup . to determine the selection pressures for these duplicated bdpp2c genes, we calculated the substitution ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous  mutations for these  <dig> pairs of duplicated bdpp2c genes. the ratio ka/ks can be used to measure the selection acting among the duplicated gene pairs. commonly, if the value of ka/ks is less than  <dig>  the duplicated gene pairs may evolve from purifying selection ; ka/ks =  <dig> means neutral selection; while ka/ks >  <dig> means positive selection  <cit> . the result showed that ka/ks for  <dig> pairs of duplicated bdpp2c genes was less than  <dig>  suggesting that all duplicated bdpp2c genes have evolved mainly from purifying selection . we also calculated the divergence time  among  <dig> pairs of duplicated bdpp2c genes based on a clock-like rate of  <dig>  × 10– <dig> mutations per synonymous site per year, as proposed previously  <cit> . the result in table  <dig> showed that divergence events of duplicated bdpp2c genes were estimated to have occurred around  <dig> – <dig>  mya , and the majority of gene pairs diverged long before the divergence time of grass species   <cit> . this finding is consistent with a previous report that genes involved in conserved signal transduction regulation pathways are preferentially retained  <cit> , and this could explain why many bdpp2c genes were retained during the long evolutionary history. in addition, we examined orthologous pp2c gene pairs between b. distachyon and arabidopsis and between b. distachyon and rice. as shown in fig. 5b,  <dig> bdpp2c genes have one or two putative orthologs in rice; however, only seven bdpp2c genes have orthologs in arabidopsis, which suggests that the majority of bdpp2cs’ orthologs appeared after the divergence of monocots and dicots. considering that gene orthologs often share similar functions  <cit> , we infer that the functions of b. distachyon pp2c genes have more similarity with rice.fig.  <dig> duplication event analysis of bdpp2c genes and comparative synteny analysis among b. distachyon, arabidopsis and rice. a the data were derived from the plant genome duplication database, and  <dig> couples of duplicated bdpp2c genes were anchored to corresponding positions on b. distachyon chromosomes using the circos program. b synteny between b. distachyon and arabidopsis or between b. distachyon and rice was anchored to the corresponding position on specific chromosomes using the circos program. b. distachyon chromosomes are depicted as green segments, and arabidopsis and rice are shown in blue and red, respectively. the size of chromosomes was consistent with the actual pseudo-chromosome size. positions are in mb

expression profiles analysis of bdpp2c genes in disparate tissues and under various stress conditions
to investigate the expression profile of the  <dig> b. distachyon pp2c genes under normal growth conditions, we used quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  analysis to examine their transcription levels in three different tissues: roots, stems and leaves. most bdpp2c genes were observed to have a very broad expression range, and barely detectable or no expression was observed for only nine genes . the qrt-pcr data showed that  <dig> bdpp2c genes were highly expressed in all three tissues, while  <dig> displayed weak expression. seven bdpp2c genes  were found to be highly expressed preferentially in stems; and two  were highly expressed in leaves. however, none of the bdpp2c genes was highly preferentially expressed in roots . the expression profiles data of bdpp2c genes in various tissues are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig>  we also compared the  <dig> duplicated bdpp2c gene pairs and found that the expression pattern was very similar for  <dig> gene pairs, i.e., bdpp2c11/ <dig>  bdpp2c19/ <dig>  bdpp2c20/ <dig>  bdpp2c30/ <dig>  bdpp2c35/ <dig> and bdpp2c55/ <dig>  on the other hand, the remaining  <dig> pairs showed differential expression patterns. recent studies suggested that there was a positive correlation of duplicated gene pairs between the degree of differential expression and their divergence time, which meant that the longer the duplication, the more obvious the differentiation of the expression . in our analysis, we found that the divergence times for these seven duplicated gene pairs with similar expression pattern were actually more recent . these results were also consistent with the expression of atpp2c and ospp2c paralogous gene pairs, indicating the diversification of expression between duplicated pp2c gene pairs.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of bdpp2c genes in various tissues. the heat map shows the real-time qpcr analysis results of bdpp2c genes expression in roots, stems, leaves and seedlings. t, seedling; r, root; s, stem; l, leaf



it has been demonstrated that subgroup a pp2cs in arabidopsis, foxtail millet and rice are transcriptionally up-regulated upon exogenous aba treatment or stress conditions that stimulate aba biosynthesis  <cit> . seven members of subgroup a atpp2cs have been characterized as negative regulators of aba responses in aba-mediated physiological processes . in b. distachyon, subgroup a bdpp2cs includes eight members . the qrt-pcr result suggested that six of these genes were highly induced by exogenous aba treatment, the exceptions being bdpp2c <dig> and bdpp2c <dig>  consistently, bdpp2cs from subgroup a were also differentially up-regulated by drought, salt, cold, heat or h2o <dig> treatment. among them, bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig> and bdpp2c <dig> were continuously up-regulated and remained at a high level upon all of these treatments. both bdpp2c <dig> and bdpp2c <dig> were up-regulated by drought, salt, cold, or h2o <dig>  whereas they were down-regulated by heat treatment. for bdpp2c <dig>  the expression level increased under drought or salt treatment; however, cold, heat and h2o <dig> repressed its expression . in addition, bdpp2c <dig> from subgroup d, bdpp2c <dig> from subgroup f and bdpp2c <dig> from subgroup g also exhibited strongly increased expression levels in response to aba and abiotic treatments , suggesting that they may participate in the regulation of aba signaling pathways. similarly, the expression profiles of bdpp2cs in other subgroups under exogenous hormone or abiotic treatments for 3 h or 6 h were analyzed as well using qrt-pcr. the other two exogenous hormones, i.e., meja and sa, were also tested. the heatmaps derived from expression profiles revealed that about 50–80 % of the bdpp2c genes were induced by various abiotic conditions or aba treatment. on the other hand, most of the bdpp2c genes were up-regulated within 3 h of treatment by meja or sa, whereas only  <dig> and  <dig> bdpp2c genes maintained the increase until 6 h, respectively. in our analysis, the expression profiles of bdpp2c genes under abiotic stresses, including cold, heat, drought and high salinity, showed differential and overlapping expression patterns. previous studies have suggested that different stresses can activate the same genes in distinct signaling pathways  <cit> , which might be the result of the production of some common signaling component such as aba or calcium triggered by different stress stimuli. increasing these signaling components leads to activation of protein kinases, including mapk, cdpk, ccamk and snrk <dig>  and then regulates the activities of transcription factors, leading to downstream responses. moreover, such overlapping expression patterns might be the basis of crosstalk between different pathways, promoting the complex signal pathways for plants under abiotic stress conditions. furthermore, we treated the b. distachyon seedlings with cdcl <dig> and zncl <dig> solutions, two heavy-metal stresses, and analyzed the changes in transcript abundances of bdpp2c genes. the expression analysis revealed that 60 % of bdpp2c genes shared a similar response pattern between cdcl <dig> and zncl <dig> treatments. for instance, the expression levels of bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig> and bdpp2c <dig> were up-regulated after 3 h and retained relatively high levels for 6 h when treated with cdcl <dig> and zncl <dig>  however, for bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig> and bdpp2c <dig>  their expression was down-regulated after 3 h and then up-regulated or returned to basal levels after 6 h.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of bdpp2c genes under biotic/abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments. clustering of all bdpp2c genes according to their expression profiles under biotic/abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments. the expression levels of genes are presented using fold-change values transformed to log <dig> format compared with the control. the color bar represents fold-change values: green, representing down-regulation ; red, representing up-regulation 



the previous study has reported that atpp2cg <dig> is induced by drought, salt or exogenous aba treatment and thus positively regulates salt tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, bdpp2c <dig>  a homolog of atpp2cg <dig>  was also found to be strongly responsive to aba and abiotic treatments . interestingly, cdcl <dig> and zncl <dig> treatments resulted in an obvious increase in its expression, which indicates that pp2c members in the g group may be related to heavy-metal-resistant pathways in plants. in addition, we also investigated the expression levels of bdpp2cs after phytopathogens’ infection. bd <dig> seedling was infected with f. graminearum  and two m. griseastrains . as shown in fig.  <dig>  many bdpp2cs were significantly down-regulated at 4 h and 12 h after infection with all three phytopathogens. only  <dig> bdpp2cs were up-regulated by a single phytopathogen within 4–12 h, such as bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig>  bdpp2c <dig> and bdpp2c <dig>  it has been demonstrated that the pp2c win <dig> , a homolog in arabidopsis with bdpp2c <dig>  can enhance the resistance to phytopathogen p. syringae  <cit> . consistent with this, the expression of bdpp2c <dig> was remarkably increased after exogenous salicylic treatment and phytopathogen ph <dig> treatment. the expression profiles of bdpp2c genes under different treatments are listed in additional file 4: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  these results indicate that pp2cs may be involved not only in the regulation of abiotic stresses but also in biotic stresses.

as mentioned above,  <dig> pairs of paralogous bdpp2c genes involved in segmental duplication events have been found, which suggested that chromosome gene duplication may play an important role in the expansion and evolution of the bdpp2c gene family. it has been observed that segmentally duplicated genes displayed a greater degree of functional divergence, and they exhibited pseudo-functionalization, neo-functionalization and retention of gene functions  <cit> . we analyzed the expression pattern of  <dig> segmentally duplicated gene pairs under various stresses, which showed that  <dig> pairs of genes had very similar expression pattern, indicating the retention of their functions . most of the duplicated gene pairs were found to have a high amino acid sequence homology and share similar exon/intron structures. although the diversification of expression occurred between duplicated pp2c gene pairs, their functions still were retained. this indicated that diversification of expression may occur after a very short period of time, while function diversification may need more time.

the relevance analysis between cis-acting element and stress-induced bdpp2c gene expression
cis-acting elements in promoter regions of genes often play key roles in stress responses in plants. for example, aba-responsive elements  are responsive to aba, drought or salt signals  <cit> . ltr is involved in low-temperature response and regulation  <cit> . tca-element and cgtca-motif have good correlation with the expression levels after meja and sa treatment, respectively  <cit> . analyses of cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of the  <dig> bdpp2c genes showed that every b. distachyon pp2c gene carried one or more abre, hse, ltr, tca-element, and cgtca-motif in their promoter regions, suggesting the significant relationship between bdpp2cs and stress responses . among them, bdpp2c genes from subgroup a contained the greatest number of abre, which is consistent with arabidopsis, foxtail millet and rice  <cit> . further analyses demonstrated that a good correlation existed between the number of the abres and the expression of bdpp2c in the majority of subgroups after 3 h or 6 h aba treatment according to the statistical analysis. similarly, this correlation was also found to exist between the number of abres and the expression levels after salt or drought treatment . this result indicates that bdpp2c genes may be involved in drought or salt stress through the aba-dependent pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, beyond a comprehensive analysis of phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, conserved domains, chromosomal locations, gene duplications, cis-elements and expression patterns of the pp2c gene family was carried out for the first time in a new model monocot i.e., b. distachyon, one of the key features of our results was the multiple level approaches to identify bdpp2c members from sequence alignment, motifs and domain analysis to 3d protein structure confirmation . another key feature of our result was the expression patterns of the bdpp2c genes indicated that almost all members displayed up-regulation in response to abiotic stresses such as cold, heat, peg and nacl treatments, but down-regulation to biotic stresses such as ph <dig>  guy <dig> and f <dig> infection .
