BACKGROUND
visual stimuli evoke a negative-going wave peaking between 120 ms and 200 ms after stimulus onset, which is often referred to as n <dig>  although this component is triggered by any visual stimulus, the amplitude strongly depends on the perceptual familiarity of certain stimulus classes. several studies report larger n <dig> amplitudes in adult readers to word-like stimuli compared to visual control stimuli such as symbol strings  <cit> .

in a longitudinal study, maurer and colleagues investigated the development of the word-related n <dig> by comparing words and symbol strings in pre-literate children, literate children and adults  <cit> . in pre-literate children, the n <dig> did not differentiate between words and symbols  <cit> , but was higher for words compared to symbols after the first two years of formal reading education  <cit> . investigations of the same children in the fifth grade  <cit>  and the comparison between children and adults  <cit>  showed that the n <dig> specialization for printed words continues to develop with further reading experience. in skilled adult readers, the n <dig> was reduced compared to second grade children, suggesting a u-shaped, non-linear development of the n <dig> specialization for printed words. adults and fifth graders also have shorter n <dig> latencies and stronger left lateralization than second grade children  <cit> .

the findings regarding the visual recognition of pseudowords are not consistent. while some studies found no differences between words and pseudowords  <cit> , other studies reported higher amplitudes for pseudowords relative to words  <cit>  or higher amplitudes for words relative to pseudowords  <cit> . these differential findings likely result from the large variability of tasks and different subject groups used across studies.

brem et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a brief training of grapheme-phoneme correspondence in pre-literate children results in an initial specialization for print. before training, words and symbols activated similar bilateral regions in the posterior occipito-temporal cortex. afterwards, words elicited higher activations than symbols, mainly in the left occipito-temporal cortex  <cit> . these findings can be interpreted as evidence for a premature recognition of words that already exists in early childhood. yoncheva et al.  <cit>  examined the impact of a short-term training with an artificial script on the n <dig> in adults. they trained two groups of normal reading adults to associate visual characters with corresponding spoken words. one group was instructed to associate embedded letter-like figures with phonemes , while the other group was instructed to focus on the whole visual character . after the training, visual characters produced a left-lateralized n <dig> in the grapheme-phoneme group and a right-lateralized n <dig> in the whole-word group. the results were interpreted as evidence for the phonological mapping hypothesis, which states that the left-lateralization of the word-related n <dig> to trained visual words is associated with the extent to which students focus on grapheme-phoneme-associations  <cit> .

the n <dig> amplitude is also increased for other familiar stimuli like faces  <cit>  or for visual classes for which some individuals have developed a special expertise . training with novel objects  also leads to an increase of the corresponding n <dig>  <cit> . altogether, these results suggest that visual experience with certain classes of visual stimuli lead to fast specialized processing of these visual stimuli. however, faces and other visual objects produce a bilateral or right-lateralized n <dig>  <cit> , whereas the word-related n <dig> is lateralized to the left  <cit> .

the source of the word-related n <dig> is supposed to coincide with a particular area located in the mid-portion of the left fusiform gyrus  <cit> , the putative visual word form area . this assumption is supported by evidence showing that the n <dig> is generated in left ventral occipito-temporal regions, as demonstrated by intracranial recordings  <cit>  and source localization estimates of electroencephalographic  <cit>  and magnetencephalographic recordings  <cit> . however, the proposal of a visual word form area in the left ventral occipito-temporal region is controversial  <cit> . there is evidence that the vwfa is not only devoted to the visual processing of letter strings  <cit> , but is also associated with naming, viewing or generating verbs  <cit> . additionally, the vwfa is also activated when words are presented in the tactile  or auditory modality  <cit> . these findings show that the left ventral occipito-temporal region is a polymodal area showing considerable functional heterogeneity.

regardless of the underlying brain structures, the n <dig> reflects the earliest consistent processing of linguistic stimuli and is used to investigate fast recognition processes in good as well as poor readers. a number of studies provide evidence that the fast visual specialization for print is reduced in dyslexic adults  <cit>  and children  <cit> . developmental dyslexia is an unexpected difficulty with accurate and fluent reading which occurs despite normal intelligence, motivation and exposure to adequate reading instruction and in the absence of sensory, psychiatric and neurological disorders. the failure to develop fluent reading skills often persists into adolescence and adulthood, while reading accuracy improves over time. neurobiologically, dyslexic children and adults show reduced activity in two left posterior brain systems, one parieto-temporal and one occipito-temporal  <cit> .

functionally illiterate adults are characterized by even greater difficulties during reading acquisition than dyslexic individuals. the term functional illiteracy refers to adults who have attended school for several years but who failed to acquire functional reading skills. although they received instructions in reading and writing, they left school with literacy skills that are at least three to four years below the expected level of performance  <cit> . as a result, they can use written language only to a very limited extent; they are unable to read and understand even short sentences  <cit> . a recent survey concludes that there are about  <dig>  million functional illiterates in germany . similar prevalence rates are reported for other industrialized countries, e.g. 9% for france  <cit>  or 16% for the united kingdom  <cit> . for the united states it is estimated that about 43% of the adult population are not able to use printed materials for everyday activities in an appropriate way  <cit> . functional illiteracy is often associated with specific personal obstacles in childhood concerning school  and family environment . however, these negative experiences do not apply for all individuals with low literacy skills, and are also not sufficient to let someone become functional illiterate  <cit> . accordingly, some researchers propose that functional illiteracy results from cognitive deficits coupled with environmental disadvantages  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated visual word recognition in functionally illiterate adults. participants were considered as functionally illiterate when the literacy skills were below the expected level of an average student in fourth grade . previous studies have demonstrated that visual word recognition, reflected by the n <dig>  is strongly dependent on literacy skills and develops when children learn to read  <cit> . we used an implicit reading task to explore whether the n <dig> of functionally illiterate adults changes as a result of literacy training. we therefore compared n <dig> amplitude in a group of functional illiterates with a group of normal reading adults before and after literacy training. we expected that functional illiterates show a distinct n <dig> for words and symbols since they attended school for several years and therefore have some knowledge in reading and writing. however, the word-related n <dig> was expected to be smaller than the one of normal readers because of the difference in reading skills.

functional illiterates have difficulties reading even simple words. therefore, they probably decode words and pseudowords in a similar way. consequently, we assumed that words and pseudowords produce a similar n <dig>  normal readers, on the other hand, read real words easily due to the high familiarity. since pseudowords are unknown to them, the n <dig> should be smaller for pseudowords than for real words. for symbols, no differences between functionally illiterate adults and normal reading adults were expected. moreover, the n <dig> as response to words and pseudowords should be lateralized to the left, while the n <dig> for symbols should be similar in both hemispheres or right-lateralized.

we further investigated whether the n <dig> can still be modulated in adulthood. to answer this question, a group of functional illiterates participated in an intensive literacy training. the n <dig> for word-like stimuli  should increase during the training, whereas the n <dig> for symbols is not supposed to change. for the group of normal readers, no changes in fast visual recognition processes were expected.

finally, we compared training-related changes in literacy skills and n <dig> amplitude between functional illiterate adults taking part in different literacy trainings differing mainly in the intensity of the delivered training. the experimental group participated in a high-intensity training  and the control group participated in a low-intensity training .

RESULTS
training and testing
table  <dig> presents descriptive characteristics of each group for the variables sex, age, handedness and non-verbal iq.

overall, participants had an average non-verbal iq of  <dig>  with scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  while the iq scores of trained and untrained functional illiterates were comparable, both groups differed significantly from regular readers  = - <dig> , p < .001; untrained group: t = - <dig> , p < .05). for sex, age and handedness no differences between both groups of functionally illiterates were found. however, the experimental group differed from the normal reading control group in sex ratio  =  <dig> , p < .01). handedness on the other hand was similar in both groups  =  <dig> , p = .34), while age differences marginally missed significance  =  <dig> , p = .06). the illiterate control group differed from the normal reading control group in sex ratio  =  <dig> , p < .01), but not in handedness  = . <dig> , p = .37) and age  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

reading and writing abilities of both functionally illiterate groups before and after the training were analyzed using a two-way, repeated measures anova with two levels of session  and two levels of group .

for reading ability, the anova revealed a significant main effect of session  =  <dig> , p < .01) and a significant interaction of session by group  =  <dig> , p < .05). according to post-hoc paired t-tests, only trained functional illiterates improved in their reading ability from pre- to posttest  = - <dig> , p < .001), while untrained functional illiterates did not show any considerable changes in their reading scores . furthermore, trained and untrained functional illiterates did not differ in their reading ability at pretest  = - <dig> , p = .72).

for writing ability, a significant interaction of session by group was found  =  <dig> , p < .001). this effect is mainly due to the fact that trained functional illiterates significantly reduced the number of errors in the standardized writing test  =  <dig> , p < .001), while there were no statistically reliable changes in the group of untrained functional illiterates . importantly, trained and untrained functional illiterates did not differ in their writing ability prior to training  =  <dig> , p = .31).

reading and writing abilities of regular readers were assessed with normative tests appropriate for adults without reading difficulties . all subjects scored within a range that can be expected for their age and formal educational status.

behavioral data
results of the behavioral task  are presented in table  <dig>  separately for each group.

three-way anovas with condition , session  and group  were calculated for each measure of behavioral performance.

the anova conducted for accuracy revealed a main effect of condition  =  <dig> , p < .001), session  =  <dig> , p < .01) and a significant interaction of condition by group  =  <dig> , p = .001). the interaction between condition and group was significant for words vs. symbols  =  <dig> , p < .05), pseudowords vs. symbols  =  <dig> , p < .01), and words vs. pseudowords  =  <dig> , p < .05). the superior performance for word-like stimuli compared with symbols was more pronounced in the normal reading control group than in both groups of functional illiterates . functional illiterates were more accurate in detecting words compared to pseudowords, while normal reading controls detected words and pseudowords with similar accuracies .

regarding the number of false alarms, results showed a significant effect of condition  =  <dig> , p < .001). there were more false alarms in the symbol than in the word  =  <dig> , p < .001) and pseudoword condition  =  <dig> , p < .001). subjects also made more false alarms when they had to detect pseudowords compared to words .

for the response times to correct identifications, no significant effects were observed.

eeg data
in all groups, words, pseudowords and symbol strings elicited a posterior n <dig> between  <dig> and 200 ms at left  and right  occipito-temporal electrodes .

peak latency
the average peak latency of the n <dig> was  <dig>  ms  across conditions, sessions, electrodes and groups. a four-way anova with condition , session , hemisphere  and group  conducted for p7/p <dig> revealed no statistically reliable differences between these peak latencies.

peak amplitude
first, we tested for differences in amplitude of the word and pseudoword-conditions. the two conditions did not differ in component structure or amplitude . thus, for all subsequent analyses, we averaged words and pseudo-words resulting in a new stimulus condition termed word-like.

we then tested if there were group differences at pretest. the results showed that the peak amplitudes of the n <dig> did not differ between the groups across electrodes and conditions . the peak amplitudes of the n <dig> were entered into a repeated measures anova with the within subject factors condition  and session  and the between subject factor group . the anova was conducted for the left occipito-temporal electrode p <dig>  results showed a significant effect of condition  =  <dig> , p < .001) and a significant interaction between condition, session and group  =  <dig> , p < .05). post-hoc t-tests revealed that the n <dig> was higher for word-like stimuli compared to symbols  = - <dig> , p < .001).

because the three-way anova evidenced a significant interaction of condition by session by group, this effect was tested separately for each group with two-way anovas . for trained functional illiterates, the analysis revealed a main effect of condition  =  <dig> , p < .001) and a significant interaction between condition and session  =  <dig> , p < .01). these effects reflect enhancements of the left n <dig> for word-like stimuli  =  <dig> , p < .05), while the left n <dig> for symbols did not change over time  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), as depicted in figure  <dig> 

untrained functional illiterates displayed only a significant main effect of condition  =  <dig> , p < .01), due to a slightly higher n <dig> for word-like stimuli than for symbol strings  = - <dig> , p < .01). the peak amplitudes for word-like stimuli  = - <dig> , p = .23) and symbol strings  = - <dig> , p = .32) did not change from pre- to posttest.

for regular readers, results showed a significant main effect of condition  =  <dig> , p < .05), which was caused by larger amplitudes for word-like stimuli compared to symbols  = - <dig> , p < .05). the anova also revealed a trend for the factor session  =  <dig> ; p = .06). according to post-hoc t-tests, the n <dig> for symbols  =  <dig> , p < .05) increased from pre- to posttest, while no significant changes were found for word-like stimuli  =  <dig> , p = .23).

to test for lateralization differences between p <dig> and p <dig>  a four-way anova with the additional within-subject factor hemisphere  was computed. this analysis revealed a significant effect of condition  =  <dig> , p < .001) and a significant interaction between condition and hemisphere  =  <dig> , p < .01). according to post hoc t-tests, the n <dig> amplitude was left-lateralized for word-like stimuli  = - <dig> , p < .05), while the n <dig> amplitudes for symbol strings were similar in both hemispheres  = - <dig> , p = .55), as can be seen in figure  <dig> 

correlations between erp data and reading ability
the difference in n <dig> amplitude between word-like stimuli and symbol strings at p <dig> was computed and correlated with the reading ability  at pre- and posttest. for trained functional illiterates, the increase of the n170-difference from pre- to posttest correlated positively with reading ability at pretest , and at posttest . additionally, the n170-difference between words and symbols correlated with reading ability at pretest  and at posttest .

moreover, participants with higher amplitudes of the word-related n <dig> at pre-  and posttest  showed larger improvements in reading. these correlations were still significant after controlling for subject’s age and cognitive ability. no significant correlations were observed for untrained functional illiterates.

correlations between erp data and behavioral performance
behavioral analyses revealed that subjects were more accurate in detecting words and pseudowords compared to symbols. therefore, we examined whether the different task difficulty is reflected in the erp data, i.e. correlates with n <dig> amplitudes. as a result, behavioral performances in the different conditions did not correlate with the corresponding n <dig> amplitudes .

discussion
the present study examined visual word recognition of functionally illiterate adults. the word-related n <dig> is an erp component which reflects fast recognition of visually presented words, and develops within the first years of reading acquisition  <cit> . we investigated with an implicit reading task whether the n <dig> can still be modulated when adults learn to read fluently.

in accordance with previous findings  <cit> , the present study found a larger n <dig> for word-like stimuli than for symbol strings. in contrast to our initial hypothesis, functionally illiterate adults also showed a distinct n <dig> for word-like stimuli and symbols, which resembled the clear n170-difference of normal reading adults. additionally, the n <dig> amplitudes were left-lateralized for words and pseudowords, which is in line with other studies  <cit> . brem and colleagues demonstrated that children initially use a broad bilateral network in the ventral posterior occipito-temporal cortex when they have to recognize words  <cit> . with increasing reading expertise this bilateral network is progressively confined to the left hemisphere  <cit> . accordingly, the literacy skills of functional illiterates obtained in childhood seem to be sufficient to account for the left-lateralized discrimination between word-like stimuli and symbol strings.

behaviorally, all groups were more accurate in detecting words and pseudowords compared to symbol strings. the reduced accuracy and the increased number of false alarms in the symbol condition suggest that the task was especially difficult to perform for this stimulus type. memorizing symbol strings, which were equally unfamiliar to the participants, seems to be more difficult than memorizing words and pseudowords  <cit> . however, these behavioral differences were detected in all groups, and did not correlate with the corresponding n <dig> amplitudes. moreover, similar effects of stimulus type on accuracy were observed in previous studies using the same implicit reading task  <cit> .

functional illiterates detected repetitions of words and pseudowords less accurately than normal readers, which can be attributed to their different literacy skills. however, functional illiterates were more accurate in detecting words compared to pseudowords, indicating that detecting pseudowords was slightly more difficult for them compared to words. maurer and colleagues propose an explanation in terms of the degree to which grapheme-to-phoneme conversion strategies are automatized. if the strategies are less automatized, subjects might use them to a lesser degree in implicit reading tasks  <cit> . although functional illiterates probably have knowledge of the grapheme-to-phoneme rules, they are likely less developed than the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion skills of normal reading adults. this could explain why normal reading adults show no difference in detecting words and pseudowords, while functional illiterates are more accurate in detecting words compared to pseudowords.

as an important result of the present study, the amplitude of the word-related n <dig> has increased in functional illiterates after several months of intensive literacy training, whereas no changes occurred in the symbol condition. consequently, improvements in literacy skills influence the word-related n <dig>  even when adults learn to read fluently. the assumption that changes in the n <dig> are related to literacy skills is supported by a positive correlation between the enhancement of the word-related n <dig> and participant’s reading skills before and after training, evident only in the group of trained functional illiterates. in addition, the pre-test reading ability predicted the response to intervention: higher reading abilities at the beginning of the training are linked to larger increases of the n170-difference and higher gains in literacy skills. a parallel fmri study revealed that subjects who participated in the intensive literacy training showed significant increases of activity in the fusiform gyrus, including the visual word form area, after eight months of training  <cit> . although it is difficult to localize the sources of a certain erp component, several converging studies indicate that the word-related n <dig> is generated in the left fusiform gyrus  <cit> . therefore, both eeg and fmri evidence training-related changes in the visual word recognition of functionally illiterate adults, associated with the visual word form system in the occipito-temporal region.

in contrast to the experimental group receiving intensive literacy training, no changes were observed in functional illiterates receiving less intensive training. although this group attended literacy courses as well, the present study demonstrated that literacy trainings held with a low frequency  did not cause changes in literacy skills and in early visual word recognition.

in normal reading adults, the word-related n <dig> also did not change over time. this result was very much expected, because skilled readers differ from functionally illiterate adults in their proficient literacy skills. hence, they process words on a very high level reflected by stable n <dig> amplitudes at both test times. surprisingly, the n <dig> for symbol strings seems to increase from pre- to posttest in the normal reading control group, as can be seen in figure  <dig>  although the effect does not approach significance in the conducted anova, post-hoc tests show a marginally significant increase from pre- to posttest for symbols only. as described in the methods section, the normal reading control group consists of psychology students as well as non-students, suggesting that this group differs from functionally illiterate adults in more aspects than literacy skills. the cognitive ability seems to be the most relevant factor, since members of the normal reading control group have higher non-verbal iq values than both groups of functionally illiterate adults. the sub-group of students seems to particularly contribute to these differences. therefore, we analyzed the data reported in the result section again excluding students this time. the results did not change with regard to the word n <dig>  as the amplitudes were still comparable at both test times. interestingly, there was a considerable change in the n <dig> elicited by symbols. at pretest, the symbol n <dig> remained similar to that obtained before with students included, but at posttest the symbol n <dig> was significantly reduced. it can therefore be concluded that the increase of the symbol n <dig> from pre- to posttest was caused by the inclusion of students.

we further examined whether cognitive ability and age were related to changes in n <dig> amplitudes across all subjects. although age had no impact on n <dig> changes from pre- to posttest, a significant correlation between cognitive ability and the increase of the n <dig> for symbols was found: subjects with a higher cognitive ability demonstrated a greater increase of the n <dig> for symbols. this could be attributed to the fact that cognitive ability was measured with the culture fair test . in this test, subjects have to figure out relations between shapes and figures. similar symbolic material is used in the cft and the paradigm of the present study which might explain the positive correlation between these variables. since students have a higher cognitive ability than the other participants, this could explain the greater increase in the symbol n <dig>  considering these findings, a control group more similar to functionally illiterate adults is needed in future studies. additionally, it should be further investigated how the symbol n <dig> is modulated by cognitive ability.

brem and colleagues examined changes of the n <dig> for words and symbol strings in adults when stimuli are presented repeatedly. the n <dig> for symbols changed in amplitude and topography, whereas the n <dig> for words remained constant  <cit> . since those changes only occurred for symbols, they cannot solely be attributed to the repeated presentation of stimuli. they rather reflect the development of a visual competence for symbols. it is likely that psychology students who might deal more often with symbolic material than the other participants developed a visual competence for symbol strings after single presentation.

given the fact that functional illiterates do not show a reduced word-specific n <dig> compared to regular readers, the question arises why one would expect training-related changes in the n <dig> for words even though functional illiterates already reached the same level as proficient readers. this result might be more comprehensible in light of maurer and colleagues’ longitudinal data regarding the development of n <dig> specialization. these studies revealed that in non-reading preschoolers, the n <dig> does not differentiate between words and symbols. during the first years of literacy instruction the n <dig> is increasingly tuned for words. subsequently, the word-specific n <dig> decreases again in adolescence and adulthood when individuals become proficient readers  <cit> . in terms of the present results, we assume that functional illiterates classify between nonreading children in preschool and elementary school children. it might be reasonable that their n <dig> specialization has not yet reached its peak, but will still increase with additional reading practice and subsequently decrease when a certain literacy level has been achieved. consequently, the n <dig> of functional illiterates and regular readers observed in the present study reflect different stages of n <dig> development. while functional illiterates probably still demonstrate increases with gains in literacy skills, it is not likely that regular readers show any changes in their word-specific n <dig> due to their long standing reading experience.

evaluation of the training
the experimental group who received intensive literacy training significantly improved their literacy skills and demonstrated word-related changes in n <dig> amplitudes. previous studies confirm that adults with severe reading impairments can improve their reading skills . however, several recent intervention studies revealed only low to moderate effects in adults  <cit> ). children who were taught with similar approaches showed significantly larger improvements than adults. it appears that interventions that have proven to be effective in childhood are not easily transferable to the field of adult education. especially the intensity of intervention programs is critical to their effectiveness. the present study can be seen as evidence that intensive literacy trainings are more effective than less intensive literacy trainings.

the two programs also differed in their methodological approaches. the depicted conventional courses rely on similar teaching strategies used during literacy education of children. since these strategies already proved to be insufficient to teach functionally illiterate adults how to read and write in childhood, they were complemented with additional methods in the training for the experimental group. these methods comprised a training of perceptual abilities, audio-visual integration, and phoneme discrimination as well as joint social activities to strengthen self-confidence. however, the design of the present study does not allow to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the individual methods implemented in the current program. further research is required to investigate whether the employed methods have differential effects on the training success. in future studies, literacy trainings have to be offered with the same intensity if the effectiveness of alternative approaches is evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
functionally illiterate adults showed a larger n <dig> response to words and pseudowords than to symbol strings, indicating a visual expertise for linguistic stimuli. a group of functionally illiterate adults receiving intensive literacy training demonstrated improvements in their literacy skills which were linked to an increase of the word-related n <dig>  in contrast, another group of functional illiterates attending less intensive literacy courses did not show any changes in the word-related n <dig>  our study demonstrates that the n <dig> can still be modulated in adulthood, when functionally illiterate adults learn to read fluently. however, intensive literacy training is necessary to induce training-related changes.
