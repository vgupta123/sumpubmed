BACKGROUND
inflammation of the udder tissue, known as mastitis, has become one of the most costly and prevalent diseases affecting dairy cows worldwide  <cit> . mastitis onset has been associated with many different bacterial infections, but the most common are staphylococci, streptococci and coliform bacteria  <cit> . escherichia coli  is a prevalent environmental pathogen that routinely colonizes dairy cattle, and represents a significant risk of mastitis  <cit> . e. coli-induced mastitis is characterized as a relatively short-term disease process  <cit>  and induces a distinct acute phase response . the precise response kinetics, however, depend on various biological and environmental factors, such as host diet, e. coli strain and dose, and time of infection  <cit> .

the innate immune response is triggered at the earliest stages of infection, as its function is to recognize pathogens that have not been encountered before  <cit> . therefore, the innate immune system is effectively the first line of defence against intramammary e. coli infection. many of the cytokines and other inflammatory mediators involved in the innate immune response are characterized by a specific pathogen-dependent expression profile  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria, such as e. coli, are characterized by an early and high expression of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in the milk, while gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus , show a lower and/or delayed expression of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in the milk  <cit> . moreover, the inflammatory responsiveness to e. coli endotoxin is highly influenced by the cows' lactation stage  <cit> . recently, the toll-like receptor - <dig> transduction pathway was suggested as a crucial contributor to robust mammary gland immune defence against e. coli mastitis  <cit> . this pathway involves induction of cellular inflammatory and apoptotic responses, and eventually leads to the activation of nf-κb factors in resident macrophages, monocytes and epithelial cells  <cit> . diapedesis of polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes  is impaired in early lactation, and a reduced neutrophil influx into the mammary gland during the apr is believed to promote the incidence of severe e. coli mastitis during this period  <cit> . hence, both macrophages and neutrophils are considered as important players in the local apr during e. coli mastitis.

to gain a detailed understanding of the defence mechanisms employed by the mammary gland, the genes and gene pathways that are altered in response to the presence of pathogenic bacteria should be identified and characterized. the development of microarray technology has enabled comprehensive screening of defined gene expression profiles in specific tissues, such as the mammary gland. recently, this type of analysis was carried out on udder tissue collected post mortem in dairy cows experimentally infected with medium to high doses of s. aureus  <cit> , s. uberis  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit>  intramammary.

the principal focus of our study was on the gene-expressions in udder tissue biopsies collected ante mortem from dairy cows during the apr  and the chronic stage  of the e. coli infection when using a low inoculation dose of e. coli in early lactation. the aim being to identify the global mammary gland gene expressions and gene pathways associated with bovine e. coli mastitis during the acute and chronic stage of the infection in early lactating dairy cows. furthermore, the aim was to identify common genes involved in the local mammary gland apr between our study and two other gene-expression studies on e. coli mastitis  <cit>  independent of e. coli strain and dose, cow's lactation stage and number, tissue collection method and gene analysis used in the studies.

RESULTS
clinical examinations and para-clinical measurements
all challenged cows  developed e. coli mastitis and were free of infections with other major udder pathogens during sampling. e. coli was identified in the infected quarters of all  <dig> cows at  <dig> h after inoculation. at t =  <dig> h p.i., e. coli was present in variable concentrations in eight of the cows, and by  <dig> h all cows had cleared the infection.

body temperature, colony forming units  of e. coli in the milk, milk somatic cell count , and the concentrations of milk amyloid a  and of serum amyloid a  in blood in response to e. coli infection at time points t =  <dig> h, t =  <dig> h, and t =  <dig> h are presented in figure  <dig>  in the acute phase , the body temperature, e. coli cfu in the milk, scc, concentrations of maa in milk and saa in blood were significantly increased, as compared to the data from t =  <dig> h and t =  <dig> h. these findings were consistent with symptomology of e. coli-induced mastitis, and confirmed the model system. at t =  <dig> h, even though all cows had successfully cleared the e. coli, scc and maa concentrations remained higher than at t =  <dig> but to a lesser extent than observed at t =  <dig> h. these findings confirmed the establishment of the chronic stage.

acute phase response
in total,  <dig> de transcripts were detected  at this stage, of which  <dig> corresponded to  <dig> annotated genes . hierarchical clustering of the de transcripts revealed two main clusters .

up-regulated genes
cluster  <dig>  contained  <dig> of the de transcripts, representing  <dig> distinct genes. hypergeometric gene set analysis based on the go information revealed overrepresentation of  <dig> gene sets . of these gene sets,  <dig> were directly related to immune response. go identifiers were related to inflammatory response , chemotaxis , immune response , leukocyte migration , response to lipopolysaccharide , and tlr signalling pathway . in contrast, the hypergeometric gene set analysis based on the kegg information revealed  <dig> gene sets . these were related to chemokine signalling pathway , tlr signalling pathway , leukocyte transendothelial migration , cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction , natural killer  cell-mediated cytotoxicity , and rig-i-like signalling pathway . among the de transcripts in this cluster the genes encoding chemokine  ligands , chemokine  ligands , interleukin 1β , interleukin  <dig> , interleukin receptors , interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , neutrophil cytosolic factors , and toll-like receptors  were represented.

*a hypergeometric gene set enrichment test was performed based on cluster  <dig> of the contrast t <dig> vs. c <dig>  overrepresentation of gene sets defined by the kegg database was tested using the fisher's exact test. a gene set was considered significant if p <  <dig> .

down-regulated genes
cluster  <dig> contained  <dig> de transcripts, representing  <dig> known genes that were down-regulated in response to e. coli infection. the hypergeometric gene set analysis based on the go information revealed over representation of  <dig> gene sets mainly related to fat metabolism , including fatty acid biosynthetic process , lipid metabolic process , and fatty acid metabolic process . the hypergeometric gene set analysis based on the kegg information revealed over representation of  <dig> gene sets, of which three were related to fatty acid synthesis: fatty acid metabolism , fatty acid biosynthesis , and glycerolipid metabolism  . among the de transcripts in this cluster, genes encoding dehydrogenase/reductase  member  <dig> , fatty acid synthase , fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein  <dig> , lipase maturation factor  <dig> , and lipoprotein lipase  were represented.

*a hypergeometric gene set enrichment test was performed based on cluster  <dig> of the contrast t <dig> vs. c <dig>  overrepresentation of gene sets defined by the kegg database was tested using the fisher's exact test. a gene set was considered significant if p <  <dig> .

chronic stage response
in total, only two de transcripts  were detected . these encode haptoglobin  and chemokine  ligand  <dig> , respectively.

overlap of de genes between live tissue and related analysis in necrotic tissue
the de genes were compared to two other related studies on gene expression in response to e. coli infection in the udder  <cit> . in , the overlap of statistically significant de genes at t =  <dig> h p.i. is presented. a group of  <dig> genes was represented in all three studies . among this group are immune-related genes, namely those encoding chemokine  ligands , chemokine  ligands , intercellular adhesion molecules , immediate early response , interferon-induced transmembrane proteins , interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , interleukins , interleukin receptors , haptoglobin , neutrophil cytosolic factors , s <dig> calcium binding proteins , serum amyloid a  <dig> , toll-like receptors , and tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily members . the hypergeometric gene set analysis based on the kegg information revealed overrepresentation of  <dig> gene sets, of which one was related to fatty acid metabolism ) while the  <dig> other kegg identifiers were related to the immune response: chemokine signalling pathway , leukocyte transendothelial migration , natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity , toll-like receptor signalling pathway , and rig-i-like receptor signalling pathway  .

*a hypergeometric gene set enrichment test was performed based on overlapping genes between the study described in this paper, mitterhuemer et al.  <cit> , and rinaldi et al.  <cit> . overrepresentation of gene sets defined by the kegg database was tested using the fisher's exact test. a gene set was considered significant if p <  <dig> .

discussion
in this study, we analyzed the global gene expression changes in the bovine mammary gland that occurred during the acute phase and chronic stage of experimental e. coli mastitis in dairy cows in early lactation. tissue samples were collected with a biopsy pistol, which made it possible to sample the same e. coli-infected cows in vivo at two different time periods.

the acute phase was verified by the presence of high e. coli cfu/ml in milk, fever, increased scc and the presence of acute phase proteins maa and saa in milk and blood, respectively. marked changes in gene expression were detected in the acute stage at  <dig> h p.i. in agreement with results from other related studies the up-regulated genes were related to the immune response, with the majority of genes involved in the induction and regulation of the local inflammatory response and the apr  <cit> . among the top  <dig> kegg pathways associated with these genes were pathways involved in chemokine signalling, toll-like receptor signalling, leukocyte transendothelial migration, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cell adhesion and fc gamma r- mediated phagocytosis. this finding indicates the importance of recruitment and activation of macrophages and neutrophils to sites of infection during acute e. coli mastitis  <cit> .

in the acute phase, the group of down-regulated genes in the mammary gland was mainly associated with the lipid metabolism and fatty acid pathways. it is well known that cows with e. coli mastitis experience decreased milk production  <cit> ; however, the affected molecular mechanisms related to fat synthesis in those cows has been undefined  <cit> . the results presented in this paper, in conjunction with the results of mitterhuemer et al.  <cit> , clearly demonstrate that e. coli infection of the mammary gland reduces the expression of genes involved in fat metabolism. however, further research is needed to verify whether these genes actually influence the total amount of fat secretion in the milk or instead influence the fat percentage in the milk.

in the chronic, subclinical stage examined at  <dig> h p.i., all cows were found to have cleared the e. coli bacteria and re-established normal body temperatures. yet, the increased scc and increased concentrations of maa in milk were maintained. at this stage, gene expression had returned to control levels, with the notable exception of the genes encoding for the acute phase protein haptoglobin  and the chemokine cxcl <dig>  both genes were found to be up-regulated at the apr and chronic stage response. cxcl <dig> expression on the surface of eosinophils facilitates their ability to recruit and activate cxc receptor  <dig> -bearing cells, such as neutrophils, to the site of inflammation. in this manner, cxcl <dig> can influence tissue remodelling  <cit> , such as would be expected in recovering udder tissue. it is likely that more up-regulated genes associated with tissue modelling could have been identified if the samples had been collected earlier. however, as the biopsy procedure itself causes tissue damage and bleeding, there is a limit to how often a biopsy can be collected without influencing the gene expression results.

by comparing our study's results with those from two recent array studies using post-mortem tissues from e. coli infected cows  <cit> , we identified a particularly strong dataset of the statistically significant genes and genetic pathways present in the mammary tissue during the acute phase at  <dig> h. all three studies were conducted in the holstein friesian breed, but differed with regard to e. coli strain and dose, cows' lactation number and stage, and the sampling procedure. in our study, a low dose  model was established in primiparous dairy cows in early lactation, and tissue samples were collected in vivo using biopsies at time points  <dig> h and  <dig> h p.i. in the lobuli-alveoli area. rinaldi et al.  <cit>  used a medium dose  in a two-step inoculation model in two quarters, with a  <dig> h time-delay in multiparous cows in late lactation; these tissue samples were collected post-mortem from euthanized cows at  <dig> h and  <dig> h p.i. from four different portions of the udder. mitterhuemer et al.  <cit>  also used a medium dose model , but relied on mid-lactation cows and collected tissue samples post-mortem at  <dig> h and  <dig> h p.i. from a less well-defined area of the udder. furthermore, the gene analysis platforms used were different between each of the studies. all of the factors mentioned above can influence disease kinetics and gene expression levels in the mammary gland at  <dig> h p.i. this fact may explain why each study found a unique set of differentially expressed genes, as shown in the non-overlapping areas of the venn-diagram .

a large group of de genes were common between the three studies and were determined to be unaffected by e. coli strain, dose, cow factors, sampling method and gene expression analysis . the gene sets obtained from the analysis of the common  <dig> de genes were mainly related to the immune response and are associated with the response to e. coli mastitis  <cit>  . however, in all three studies two of the  <dig> pathways were of interest because they are principally related to intracellular infections .

the first pathway, the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway , ranked fifth on our list  and third in the comparison between the e. coli gene expression studies . the nk cells are innate lymphocytes, which function to eliminate all aberrant cells which have completely lost, or express insufficient amounts of, mhc class i molecules; virally-infected cells or tumorigenic cells are examples of such targets  <cit> . moreover, nk cells are major cytokine producers and participate in the onset and shaping of the adaptive immune response. so far, bovine nk cells have been investigated in relation to intracellular infections with protozoa and mycobacteria  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying nk cells role in the defence against extracellular bacteria, such as e. coli, remains a question of interest. nk cell lyses of damaged apoptotic and necrotic cells is one possibility. furthermore, nk cells might be involved in a response to e. coli via the dendritic cells   <cit> . the main role of the dc is processing antigens and presenting antigens to other cells, namely the antigen presenting cells . in this manner, the nk cells may play a role in maintaining homeostasis of the immune response during bacterial infections by regulating the apc amount in the secondary lymphoid organs  <cit> . in , cd <dig>  a dc-induced activation marker of nk, as well as il2ra and il2rg, which are part of the il <dig> receptor complex on lymphocytes and nk cells, are found in the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. this suggests a possible function of nk cells in the immune defence process directed against e. coli in the mammary gland. to our knowledge, nk and dc have not been identified in healthy or inflamed mammary gland tissues from dairy cows; and, it remains to be shown if and how they are recruited from the blood compartment or local lymph nodes to the mammary gland.

the second interesting pathway, the rig-i-like receptor signalling pathway , ranked sixth on our list. cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages and dc, express a number of pattern-recognition receptors  that specifically recognize unique pathogen-associated molecular patterns . in this study, as well as in others, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are characterized as being significantly influenced by e. coli mastitis. comparison of the three related studies also provided evidence for involvement of molecules functioning in the rig-i-like receptor pathway . the gene-encoded products include receptors such as rig-i, mda <dig>  and lgp <dig>  which are cytoplasmatic proteins that recognize viral dna and rna  <cit> . following recognition of viral-associated molecular patterns, the rig-i-like receptors stimulate the synthesis of multiple cytokines including the group of interferon type  <dig> cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines that influence protein synthesis, growth arrest and apoptosis. furthermore, the rig-i-like receptors enhance dc maturation, nk cell activation, antibody production and differentiation of cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, which in turn facilitate the adaptive immune response  <cit> . whether the rig-i-like receptors are up-regulated directly from contact with e. coli components in the mammary gland or indirectly via cross-induction through other tlrs is yet unknown.

the exact role of the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway  and the rig-i-like receptor signalling pathway  in the response to e. coli infection of the bovine udder is still unresolved. the fact that identical pathway-associated genes were similarly regulated during the apr in three independent studies indicates that further investigation of these pathways and their related cells will provide significant insights into the pathogenesis of e. coli mastitis. furthermore, this work sets stage for additional work to determine whether patterns of gene expression associated with udder infections with gram positive bacteria e.g. s. aureus and s. uberis differs from that of gram negative infection and whether the timing of gene changes are similar.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified multiple de genes involved in the apr and two genes in the chronic stage response to e. coli-induced mastitis in the mammary gland of dairy cows in early lactation. the up-regulated genes from the local apr were involved in the immune response, while the down-regulated genes were primarily involved in fat metabolism. comparison of the de genes in the apr of our study with those detected in two other related gene expression studies on e. coli mastitis revealed a common set of  <dig> de genes existed despite differences in e. coli strain and dose, cow lactation stage and number, tissue collection method and gene analysis method. based on the annotation and gene pathway analysis it is suggested that these genes play a central role in general host defence against e. coli infections in the mammary gland.
