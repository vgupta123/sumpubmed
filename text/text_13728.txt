BACKGROUND
as sessile organisms, plants have evolved a highly sophisticated and elaborate signaling network to respond and adapt to various biotic and abiotic stresses. to precisely respond to diverse stimuli in different tissues or developmental stages, the defense signaling network must be orchestrated within a larger physiological and developmental context. numerous data from large scale transcriptome profiling analysis strongly support the existence of regulatory interactions and coordination between signaling networks, rather than linear pathways  <cit> . to some extent the signaling components of this intricate network to biotic and abiotic stresses are universal  <cit> . comparing multiple gene expression experiments performed on the affymetrix ath <dig> platform has identified a universal stress response transcriptome  <cit> . in addition to a general stress response, there are also several studies that indicate that plants are able to prioritize between different stresses and that a combination of stresses leads to unique gene expression profiles  <cit> . execution of an appropriate defense response is linked to multiple interacting components, including a rapid and transient reactive oxygen species  burst, altered cytoplasmic and chloroplastic ca2+ transients, plant hormones including salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , abscisic acid , ethylene, and transcriptional reprogramming  <cit> .

activation of a ros burst is a common response to both biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . in addition, ros are signaling molecules involved in control and regulation of other biological processes, such as aging, cell death, and development  <cit> . exposure of plants with the gaseous ros ozone  triggers an apoplastic ros production, which is similar to the ros burst observed after pathogen infection and activation of cell wall peroxidases and nadph oxidases  <cit> . extensive comparisons of altered gene expression profiles from arabidopsis thaliana elicited by o <dig> and other abiotic and biotic stresses indicate a high degree of overlap between o <dig> and treatment with a bacterial microbe associated molecular pattern  flg <dig>  <cit> . one of the earliest responses elicited by flg <dig> treatment is an apoplastic ros burst  <cit> , thus providing a mechanistic link for the similarity between gene expression changes elicited by o <dig> and flg <dig>  apoplastic ros are also regulators of cell death through interplay with several other signaling pathways, including sa and ja/ethylene signaling pathways  <cit> .

sa, ja, and ethylene are involved in many aspects of defense signaling and numerous studies have investigated the interaction between these hormones  <cit> . it is generally believed that antagonism between sa and ja allows plants to prioritize the defense between biotrophic or necrotrophic pathogens and insects. sa antagonism of ja signaling is a robust response observed both when plants are infected with different pathogens  <cit> ; and when plants are directly treated with hormones  <cit> . regulators of the sa-ja antagonism include the sa receptor/transcriptional co-activator npr <dig> and the transcription factor ora <dig>  <cit> . several additional signals directly or indirectly interplay with sa to promote defense response  <cit> . early in 1990s, sa level and ros  production were found to be closely connected  <cit> . both elevated endogenous sa and application of exogenous sa in arabidopsis and tobacco are accompanied by increased ros  production  <cit> , indicating the existence of a positive feedback amplification loop with sa and ros as central players. however, continuous defense signal amplification would waste energy and indicate that coordination of sa-dependent and independent signaling components with ros signaling are of central importance to provide an appropriate defense response.

lesion mimic mutants that display spontaneous cell death have been extensively used to study the regulation of cell death  <cit> . in addition to misregulated cell death they often have other phenotypes including dwarfism, constitutively higher accumulation of sa and enhanced pathogen resistance  <cit> . some of them show accumulation of ros  in or around the lesion area  <cit> , which make lesion mimic mutants a powerful tool to investigate the relationship between ros and sa. in genetic analysis, production of sa can be reduced by the mutation sid <dig>  which is defective in the main biosynthesis pathway , or by expression of a bacterial sa degrading enzyme nahg. in several lesion mimic mutants, including acd <dig>  acd <dig> and lht <dig> expression of nahg abolishes cell death  <cit> . given the importance of sa in defense signaling it is not surprising that several other regulators working in parallel with sa signaling, or affecting sa accumulation, have been identified through various screens including suppression of lesion mimic phenotypes  <cit> . these regulators include enhanced disease susceptibility <dig> , ag2-like defense response protein <dig>  and flavin-dependent monoxygenase <dig>  which regulate cell death and defense responses  <cit> . like sid <dig>  ald <dig> and fmo <dig> are necessary for systemic accumulation of sa and downstream signaling after pathogen infection  <cit> . furthermore, a chloroplastic derived o2- signal can be processed by eds <dig> to control sa-dependent h2o <dig> accumulation as part of a mechanism limiting cell death  <cit> .

elevation of cytosolic ca2+ and production of ros are among the earliest events after initiation of stress responses  <cit> . many studies have explored the role of cngc <dig>  in regulation of ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane and its contribution to signaling in the context of immunity  <cit> , senescence  <cit> , heat stress  <cit> , and pollen growth  <cit> . null mutation of cngc <dig> was first isolated as defense no death <dig> , a mutant which exhibits a lesion mimic phenotype which is dependent on growth conditions  <cit> , increased accumulation of sa and constitutive defense activation  <cit> , and altered ca2+ transport  <cit> . studies conducted in this mutant indicate that the influx of ca2+ is associated with the pleiotropic phenotype; however, the precise mechanism with regards to ca2+ signaling is still elusive. furthermore, whereas in wildtype o <dig> strongly alters transcript levels for many defense genes, in dnd <dig> this response is blocked  <cit> . due to the pleiotropic phenotype of dnd <dig> it is far from straight forward to pinpoint the exact process which blocks the apoplastic ros signal initiated by o <dig> treatment. in this study we investigate through genetic analysis the relationship between dnd <dig>  the hormones sa, ja and ethylene, and apoplastic ros signaling in the regulation of defense gene expression and cell death. in particular, we identify a novel antagonistic interplay between sa and apoplastic ros signaling that may confer a high degree of responsiveness of plant responses to a fluctuating environment.

RESULTS
the dnd <dig> mutant displays constitutive expression of defense genes
the dnd <dig> mutant displays constitutively elevated concentration of sa and increased expression of sa induced and defense related genes  <cit> . however, the phenotypes of dnd <dig>  including the appearance of spontaneous cell death, is influenced by growth conditions  <cit> . hence, we performed dna microarray analysis on wildtype and dnd <dig> from our growth conditions using six biological repeats .  <dig> genes had increased expression and  <dig> genes had decreased expression . the annotations for many of these genes in the tair database  indicated a function in plant defense responses. to systematically evaluate the role of these genes in plant stress responses a bayesian hierarchal clustering was made with dnd <dig> and experiments performed on the affymetrix ath <dig> chip obtained from public databases . these experiments were selected to include pathogen infection, mutants that display constitutive defense activation or spontaneous cell death, and the stress hormones sa, its analog benzo  thiadiazole-7-carbothioc acid s-methyl ester , methyl-jasmonic acid  and ethylene . the genes with increased or decreased expression in dnd <dig> were consistently regulated in the similar direction by flg <dig>  late sa and bth treatment, in mutants undergoing cell death mkk1mkk <dig>  acd <dig>  csn <dig>  csn <dig> and csn <dig> and in the constitutive defense mutants siz <dig> and lht <dig>  cell death in these mutants are initiated via different mechanisms: mkk1mkk <dig> is defective in two map kinase kinases, acd <dig> lacks a ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein, csn <dig>  csn <dig> and csn <dig> lack different subunits in the cop <dig> signalosome â€“ a regulator of protein degradation, siz <dig> lacks a sumo e <dig> ligase and lht1lacks a lysine-histidine transporter  <cit> . despite different biological mechanisms being altered in these mutants, they displayed a common set of misregulated genes; this could indicate that cell death is executed through a common mechanism. we conclude that dnd <dig> in our growth conditions displayed a constitutive activated defense gene expression profile, similar to other mutants of this class  <cit> .

mutants with constitutive defense activation are defective in ros signaling
treatment of plants with o <dig> generates a precise burst of apoplastic ros and is a convenient tool to study the role of ros in regulation of defense gene expression  <cit> . previous analysis of defense marker genes in dnd <dig> treated with o <dig> indicated that this mutant had an attenuated response  <cit> . however, the role of the dnd1/cngc <dig> protein in apoplastic ros signaling is an open question, since the pleiotropic phenotype of dnd <dig>  including high sa concentration and constitutive activation of defense genes could be the source of altered ros signaling and not the lack of ca2+ transport from removal of dnd1/cngc <dig>  to explore this question, dnd <dig> and several other mutants with increased sa concentration and constitutive defense gene expression, cim <dig>  cim <dig>  lht <dig> and siz1- <dig>  <cit>  were tested in gene expression analysis using real time reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr  with marker genes selected from the dnd <dig> array analysis  and previous o <dig> gene expression analysis  <cit> . the constitutive defense mutants were selected to include both dwarfed mutants and mutants with more wildtype morphology .

consistent with previous characterization of these mutants as constitutive defense mutants, a majority of the marker genes, including pad <dig>  sag <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  had increased expression in the mutants as compared to col- <dig> in control conditions . a two hour o <dig> treatment led to strong induction of the defense genes in col- <dig>  whereas the effect of o <dig> was attenuated in all of the constitutive defense mutants, which was more pronounced in dnd <dig> . we conclude that constitutive activation of defense signaling in several different mutants interfere with the plants ability to properly respond to a ros signal from the apoplast.

sa signaling inhibits apopastic ros signaling
the results in figureÂ  <dig> indicate that sa signaling has the capacity to interfere with apoplastic ros signaling. to directly test the role of sa, plants were treated with  <dig>  or  <dig> mm sa  <dig> hours before a two hours o <dig> exposure . treatment with sa alone increased the expression of the classical sa marker genes pr <dig> and pr <dig>  furthermore, several of the other marker genes in this study were also regulated by sa, including cml <dig>  pad <dig>  sag <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  zat <dig> and zat <dig>  strikingly, sa pre-treatment at both concentrations significantly reduced the response to subsequent treatment with ozone for all marker genes except pr <dig> and pr <dig> . in an attempt to also identify marker genes with an opposite behavior , we tested the expression of frk <dig>  a flg <dig> responsive gene  <cit> . in contrast to all other genes tested, expression of frk <dig> was synergistically increased by the combined sa and ozone treatment.

to further explore whether low endogenous sa level alter apoplastic ros signaling, the sa biosynthesis deficient sid <dig> and the low sa accumulation mutant ald <dig> were used  <cit> . in both mutants o <dig> treatment led to a stronger induction of most marker genes than observed in wt plants . we conclude that there exists an inhibition by sa on apoplastic ros signaling in transcriptional activation of defense related genes.

elimination of sa in dnd <dig> partially restores its response to apoplastic ros
both ros and sa are involved in defense signaling and regulation of cell death responses. furthermore, elevated levels of ros lead to sa accumulation and vice versa, which has been termed the oxidative cell death cycle  <cit> . however, deciphering all components involved in the complex ros signaling network through a genetic analysis requires the use of mutants involved in different signaling pathways  <cit> . the dnd <dig> mutant was crossed with various other mutants defective in different hormone signals, map kinases, transcription factors, ros biosynthesis or mutants with a previously described role in cell death or defense against pathogens . the extent of cell death in the double and triple mutants was examined with trypan blue staining . of these double mutants, sa biosynthesis or sa signaling related genes sid <dig>  ald <dig>  eds <dig> and fmo <dig> reduced the amount of cell death and partially restored the altered leaf morphology of dnd <dig> . in selected double mutants gene expression was tested after two hours o <dig> treatment . in dnd1sid <dig> a partially restored response to o <dig> was observed . in contrast, although loss of ald <dig> in dnd <dig> background reduced the amount of cell death, it did not impact on the o <dig> induced gene expression profile .

the name given to dnd <dig>  defense no death, was based on its lack of pathogen induced cell death  <cit> . numerous other mutants with spontaneous cell death and elevated levels of sa have been identified and includes accelerated cell death  <dig>  and calmodulin binding transcription activator   <cit> . to further explore if the cell death phenotype of dnd <dig> was due to activation of similar signaling pathway as in other lesion mimic mutants, we introduced the acd <dig> and sr <dig> mutations into the dnd <dig> background. the lesion and dwarfism phenotype in the resulting double mutants were severely enhanced, indicating that dnd <dig> activated cell death in parallel pathways to acd <dig> and sr <dig> .

several sa dependent and independent regulators additively contribute to the attenuated apoplastic ros response
the results presented in figureÂ  <dig> and additional file  <dig> demonstrated that sa biosynthesis and signaling regulators, such as ald <dig>  pad <dig>  and eds <dig> were important for spontaneous lesion formation since inactivation of either one of them partially rescued the dnd <dig> spontaneous cell death phenotype. to further explore how these defense signaling regulators interplayed and contributed to the development of cell death and apoplastic ros response, a number of combinations were made among these genes in dnd <dig> background . the triple mutants dnd1ald1sid <dig>  dnd1eds1sid <dig>  dnd1sid2pad <dig> and dnd1ald1pad <dig> had less cell death and better growth than all double mutants . to further investigate the role of the combination of these genes in relation to apoplastic ros response, dnd1ald1sid <dig> and dnd1eds1sid <dig> were treated with two hours o <dig> and gene expression of selected marker genes tested with qpcr. remarkably, inactivation of either ald <dig> or eds <dig> in dnd1sid <dig> genetic background completely restored the o <dig> response in dnd <dig> to the wild type . we conclude that several sa dependent and independent signaling pathways, mediated via ald <dig> and eds <dig>  are co-activated in lesion formation and contribute to the attenuated apoplastic ros signaling response in dnd <dig> 

ja signaling restricts lesion formation
interplay between the hormones sa and ja optimizes the response to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . in addition, the ja insensitive mutants jar <dig> and coi <dig> have previously been shown to be sensitive to o <dig> <cit> . to gain further insight into the role of ja in the dnd <dig> pleiotropic phenotypes, a mutation that blocks ja biosynthesis  <cit> , allene oxide synthase  was introduced into dnd <dig> and dnd1sid <dig>  the dnd1aos double mutants showed severe dwarfism compared to dnd <dig> single mutant . similar to the dnd <dig> single mutant, the dnd1aos double mutant had an attenuated gene expression response after two hours o <dig> treatment . simultaneous mutations of both sa and ja signaling in dnd1sid2aos relieved the growth retardance of the dnd1aos double mutant, but induced more visible chlorosis than either dnd1aos or dnd1sid <dig> double mutants . we conclude that ja has no major role in the attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling, but is involved in regulation of plant development and cell death in the dnd <dig> background.

constitutive activation of ethylene signaling does not impact on apoplastic ros signaling
the constitutive defense mutants used in figureÂ  <dig> are all characterized by having elevated sa concentration  <cit> . another plant stress hormone, ethylene, also regulated the same set of genes as in dnd <dig> . the ctr <dig> mutant displays constitutive activation of ethylene signaling  <cit>  and is a dwarf similar to dnd <dig> . however, no differences were seen between col- <dig> and ctr <dig> in control conditions, or after o <dig> treatment for the marker genes tested in qpcr . we conclude that constitutive activation of ethylene signaling does not interfere with apoplastic ros signaling.

discussion
antagonistic interaction between plant hormone signaling pathways is frequently observed, exemplified by sa-ja in pathogen responses and cytokinin-auxin in root and shoot development  <cit> . in this study we have explored another antagonistic interaction, the attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling by sa at the level of gene expression. several lines of evidence led to this conclusion: mutants that constitutively accumulate higher concentration of sa had a dampened response to o <dig> for several different marker genes  and pre-treatment of plants with sa led to attenuation of gene expression after a subsequent o <dig> treatment . conversely, increased o3-induced expression of sa marker genes was observed in the plants with low endogenous sa levels . however, it is also clear that sa alone does not fully explain why lesion mimic mutants such as dnd <dig> have attenuated o <dig> responses. blocking sa biosynthesis by introducing the sid <dig> mutation into dnd <dig> could only partially restore a wildtype gene expression response to o <dig> . instead introduction of an additional mutation in eds <dig> or ald <dig>  giving the triple mutants dnd1sid2ald <dig> and dnd1sid2eds <dig>  brought back the gene expression pattern to the level of the col- <dig> wildtype . thus, the attenuated o <dig> response in dnd <dig> is due to the inhibition on apoplastic ros signaling by both sa dependent and independent signaling. furthermore, two other defense hormones ethylene and ja did not appear to play any major role in this attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling since ctr <dig> had wildtype response to o <dig> and dnd1aos had a similar response as dnd <dig> . the marker genes selected for qpcr were chosen for their o <dig> induction, however, the expression in single mutants sid <dig> and ald <dig> indicated that especially phytoalexin deficient <dig>  and wrky <dig> required a basal amount of sa to reach normal expression levels . in contrast zat <dig> and zat <dig> were not sensitive to background sa . the attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling by sa was valid across all marker genes tested and highlights the robustness of the response .

treatment of arabidopsis with flg <dig> rapidly activates an apoplastic rboh-dependent ros burst  <cit> , and in turn induces sa related genes, including sid <dig>  pr <dig> and npr <dig>   <cit> . meta-analysis of microarray data shows that  <dig> hours flg <dig> treatment triggers similar changes in gene expression as elicited by an apoplastic ros burst with o <dig> <cit> , implying that flg <dig> and o <dig> induce similar apoplastic ros signals. consistent with our findings that dnd <dig> has an attenuated response to o <dig> , flg <dig> triggered oxidative burst was significantly reduced in dnd <dig> <cit> . flg <dig> treatment can reduce sa induced changes in gene expression  <cit> , the same type of interaction observed between apoplastic ros and sa described in this study . this suggests that the effect of flg <dig> on sa mediated gene expression could be mediated via an apoplastic ros burst.

if the flg22-sa and apoplastic ros-sa antagonisms are two aspects of the same biological phenomenon, what benefit does this antagonism provide to the plant? activating plant defenses is costly to the plant, and given the large number of potential biotic and abiotic challenges that a plant could face, it has a clear need to prioritize which challenge should be given the highest priority. this forms the basis for sa-ja antagonism where defense against insects and necrotrophic fungi rely on the ja branch and defense against biotrophic pathogens on the sa branch. the apoplastic ros burst could have different sources, either locally from e.g. activation of rboh or cell wall peroxidases by an invading pathogen or from systemic signaling, the so called ros wave. the ros wave is mediated by rbohd generated ros production and its ability to travel along the plant suggests that it could act as a systemic signal in response to various environmental stimuli  <cit> . thus, there could be a situation where one part of the plant has already initiated sa mediated defenses due to e.g. pathogen attack, would subsequently be the recipient of the ros wave from another part of the plant. in this situation it might be preferable to execute the already initiated local defense program and put lower emphasis on the systemic ros signal. this might reveal itself as the antagonism by sa on apoplastic ros signaling observed in this study and could be a beneficial way for the plant to respond and prioritize between different environmental stimuli.

lesion mimic mutants have been crucial to identify various regulators of cell death, including the role of hormones and ros  <cit> . as a lesion mimic mutant, dnd <dig> also contributes to the study of e.g. the potential role of ca2+ in cell death regulation. the extensive double mutant collection generated in this work to study the role of apoplastic ros signaling also allow the dissection of signaling pathways involved in regulation of cell death in dnd <dig>  of the  <dig> double mutants and seven triple mutants generated, many of them did not alter the extent of cell death, thus excluding a role for map kinases, g-proteins and several transcription factors in execution of cell death in dnd <dig> . however there were several informative mutant combinations mainly related to ethylene, ja, sa and sa-related processes. the ethylene mutants  and ja biosynthesis mutant  enhanced growth defects of dnd <dig>  but did not alter the extent of cell death, implicating that these hormonal signal pathways in the dnd <dig> background are not strictly required for cell death execution. in contrast, ein <dig> enhances cell death in the lesion mimic double mutant syp121syp <dig> <cit>  and the ja insensitive coi <dig>  enhances the lesions in hrl <dig>   <cit> . thus, the requirements for ethylene and ja in cell death regulation appear to be context dependent.

sa is a crucial regulator of cell death shown by introducing the sa deficient mutant sid <dig> or a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase  into several lesion mimic mutants, including acd <dig>  atg <dig>  and dnd <dig> <cit> . these observations indicate that biosynthesis of sa via ics <dig> acts as a central hub of a sa inducing cell death program. however, sa depletion by introducing sid <dig> could only partially relieve the cell death in dnd <dig> <cit> . several other mutations which are typically associated with or acting in parallel with sa also partially reduced cell death in dnd <dig> and included eds <dig>  pad <dig>  ald <dig> and fmo <dig> . furthermore, substantially reduced cell death and improved growth was observed in triple mutants with ald <dig>  eds <dig>  fmo <dig> or pad <dig> in the dnd1sid <dig> background . fmo <dig> is a suggested positive regulator of cell death  <cit> . ald <dig> is associated with biosynthesis of pip . endogenous pip is a regulator of sar  and contributes to defense and sa signal amplification  <cit> . since cell death was further reduced in dnd1ald1sid <dig> as compared to the double mutants dnd1sid <dig> and dnd1ald <dig>  this indicates that sa and the lysine catabolite pip function synergistically in regulating cell death . eds <dig> and pad <dig> are interacting proteins that play multiple roles in plant defenses, including regulation of cell death and amplification of transcriptional responses  <cit> . expression of eds <dig> is negatively regulated by camta3/sr <dig>   <cit> . mutation of camta3/sr <dig> in dnd <dig> background resulted in enhanced cell death , possibly a result of increased eds <dig> signaling and increased sa production in dnd1sr <dig> 

extensive double and triple mutant analysis to find regulators of cell death has been done in the background of acd <dig> and syp121syp <dig> <cit> . acd <dig> encodes a plasma membrane protein with a cytoplasmic ankyrin repeat motif, but how this protein migh activate cell death is unknown. the syp121syp <dig> double mutant lacks two syntaxin proteins which are part of the snare machinery, controlling vesicle traffic and bulk transport of cargo in cells. despite the different biological processes impaired in dnd <dig>  acd <dig> and syp121syp <dig>  exactly the same regulators were found to be the crucial in all three lesion mimic mutants, and implicate sa biosynthesis , in combination with eds <dig>  pad <dig>  ald <dig> or fmo <dig> as the major pathway towards cell death. furthermore, other double mutants between various lesion mimic mutants and i.e. sid <dig> or eds <dig> show the same suppression of cell death and include acd <dig> <cit> , lsd <dig> <cit> , ssi <dig> <cit>  and lht <dig> <cit> . thus in contrast to the context dependence of ja or ethylene for cell death execution, the requirement for sa and eds <dig> appears more universal.

future research should focus on how eds <dig>  pad <dig>  ald <dig> and fmo <dig> interact with sa to regulate cell death. it is unlikely that low sa accumulation on its own would be sufficient to fully prevent cell death  <cit> . eds <dig> shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, where nuclear eds <dig> localization regulates defense gene expression  <cit>  and cytosolic eds <dig> regulates cell death  <cit> . however, sa might be more likely to execute its function through changes in gene expression. thus one potential explanation for the full suppression of cell death in lesion mimics when both sid <dig> and eds <dig> are mutated could be that both nuclear and cytosolic regulators of cell death are removed. ald1-dependent pip accumulation in systemic leaves during sar is dependent on fmo <dig>  indicating that there is possible signal amplification loop between pip, ald <dig>  fmo <dig> and sa  <cit> . all together, we propose a signaling network where ald <dig>  eds <dig>  and fmo <dig> work synergistically with sa to induce cell death in lesion mimic mutants .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified an antagonistic relationship between sa and apoplastic ros signaling that regulate defense gene expression in plants. this mechanism is likely timing and context dependent. furthermore, identification of regulatory components required for execution of cell death in dnd <dig> reinforces the crucial role of sa, ald <dig> and eds <dig> in cell death regulation. how the altered cytosolic ca2+ transport in dnd <dig> connects to downstream signaling pathways will require more studies and may include a recently identified dnd <dig> suppressor mutant, repressor of defense no death <dig>   <cit> .
