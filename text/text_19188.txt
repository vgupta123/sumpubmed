BACKGROUND
verticillium longisporum colonizes the xylem of brassicacae  <cit>  using carbohydrates, amino acids, and minerals present in the xylem sap as nutrient source. xylem sap of oilseed rape also contains a vast spectrum of proteins including many enzymes putatively involved in defence; e.g. a disease resistance response protein , chitinases , germin-like proteins  and different peroxidases  <cit> . a comparison of various species suggested that xylem sap composition was conserved across species  <cit> .

despite the presence of constitutive defence systems in the extracellular compartment, xylem-invading and inhabiting fungi provoke additional reactions. for example, analyses of tomato xylem sap after infection with the xylem-colonising fungus fusarium oxysporum revealed novel proteins including pr- <dig>  pr- <dig>  and pr- <dig>  <cit> . in rice, infection with the vascular pathogen xanthomonas oryzae induced the accumulation of a basic peroxidase in the apoplast of mesophyll cells as well as in xylem vessels  <cit> . vascular pathogens such as cladosporium fulvum and septoria tritici affected the leaf apoplast by increasing chitinases and  <dig> -β-glucanases or a germin-like protein with activity of a protease-inhibitor, respectively  <cit> . however, the example of cladosporium fulvum, which inactivates chitinases by avr <dig> and thereby, protects its cell walls from degradation shows that vascular fungi have developed specific means to disarm plant defences  <cit> .

recently, proteomic approaches have been introduced to obtain a comprehensive overview of proteins responsive in plants to pathogen attack. the apoplast, which includes the xylem sap, has received specific attention because it is the first compartment where recognition and defence may take place. when plants or cell cultures were challenged with pathogens or elicitors pronounced changes in the extracellular proteome were found such as accumulation of novel protease inhibitors, stimulation of defence proteins, modification in cell proteins, etc.  <cit> . v. longisporum is one of the most important diseases of oilseed rape  locally causing yield losses in the range of  <dig> to 50%  <cit> . activation of apoplastic defences has not been characterized in this species, although knowledge on these interactions may help to device strategies for improving plant resistance.

verticillium-infections have frequently been described as wilting disease  <cit> . for example, v. dahliae infection resulted in partial vessel occlusion by deposits secreted by neighbouring parenchyma cells  <cit> . these obstructions may delay movement of the fungus physically and also because they may contain antifungal components, e.g., elemental sulphur  <cit> . since these obstructions can be expected to affect water and nutrient transport, typical disease symptoms such as wilting, stunting, chlorosis and premature senescence, have been suggested to occur as consequences of water limitations and insufficient nutrient supply  <cit> . however, clear-cut evidence for this sequence of disease symptoms is still lacking for the b. napus – v. longisporum pathosystem. since nutrient limitations and water stress can also affect the plant defence system, it is necessary to characterize the physiological stage of infected and non-infected to plants to distinguish between responses evoked by changes in the plant conditions and those related to fungal infection.

the major aim of our study was to identify proteins activated in response to v. longisporum in the leaf apoplast and xylem sap of brassica napus and to investigate whether changes in the composition of extracellular fluid were efficient in attenuating fungal proliferation. we have characterized these responses in relation to the development of disease symptoms, photosynthetic electron transport, gas exchange and nutrient status.

RESULTS
verticillium-induced stunting is not caused by decline in photosynthetic gas exchange or plant nutrition
stunting of the stem became apparent about  <dig> days after inoculation of oilseed rape plants with vl <dig> . at  <dig> dpi , the infected plants were about two times shorter than non-infected plants and showed initial chlorotic symptoms on leaves but no wilting . during these initial stages of infection stem biomass production was more inhibited than that of leaves or roots .

photosynthetic co <dig> assimilation or transpiration were not affected in vl43-infected plants until 21dpi, indicating that the plants did not suffer from diminished water transport or stomatal limitations . however, the maximum quantum yield of psii of infected plants was lower than that of non-infected plants . this was probably the result of chlorophyll loss, which was about 17% compared with non-infected plants . overall, these reductions in chlorophyll and electron transport capacity were apparently too small to affect gross carbon assimilation.

nutrient elements were measured in leaves between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after vl <dig> infection to investigate whether vl <dig> infection had negative effects on nutrition. potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, and iron showed age-dependent changes in infected plants, which were not different from those found in non-infected plants . the concentrations of the macro-nutrients n, p, and s were higher in vl43-infected plants than in controls at  <dig> dpi . overall, these analyses show that vl <dig> infection did not cause nutrient limitations in stages of plant development where severe stunting occurred.

to study the observed changes in greater detail, apoplastic washing fluids were subjected to 2-d electrophoresis to obtain better resolution and to analyse changes in the protein patterns statistically. silver stained gels showed  <dig> ±  <dig> protein spots . we analysed  <dig> major spots common to both vl43-infected and non-infected plants to check if the apoplastic washing fluid was enriched in typical secretory proteins. only  <dig> of these spots yielded peptides. the predicted sequences corresponded mainly to extracellular enzymes involved in defence and cell wall metabolism . several spots that were represented by just one peptide could not be identified unambiguously here  but pointed also the presence of typical extracellular enzymes, which have already previously been identified in oilseed rape  <cit> . with the exception of one protein with unknown function  and two spots for a putative α-l-arabinofuranosidase , all identified proteins contained a predicted target peptide for the secretory pathway. whether the two putative α-l-arabinofuranosidase proteins were in fact mitochondrial proteins as suggested by targetp analysis, is unlikely because the reliability of the prediction was low  and the raphanus sativus enzyme, with which the highest homology existed, was shown to be localized in the cell wall fraction  <cit> . the protein with unknown functions in b. rapa var. pekinesis  displayed high homologies with a pectin esterase from a. thaliana. since pectin esterases are known cell wall and xylem sap components  <cit> , the predicted chloroplastic localization is also unlikely. overall, this supports that the washing fluid was enriched in soluble apoplastic proteins and contained only little unspecific contaminants.

the total number of spots identified on silver stained gels was not significantly changed in vl43-infected compared with non-infected plants. however, the intensity of  <dig> spots was significantly increased in the apoplast of vl- <dig> challenged plants compared with non-infected controls, whereas no spots with decreased staining intensities were found. of the  <dig> spots,  <dig> could be identified by lc-ms/ms  and corresponded to three different proteins, i.e., a basic β- <dig> -glucanase , a basic endochitinase chb <dig>  and a peroxidase. the factor by which the intensities increased ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . all proteins contained a predicted signal peptide for the secretory pathway supporting their apoplastic localisation . to corroborate these results, differentially appearing spots from page gels shown in figure  <dig> were also identified. avl <dig> was the basic glucanase corresponding to spots no. 21– <dig>  avl <dig> the basic endochitinase chb <dig> corresponding to spots no.  <dig> and  <dig> and avl <dig> the putative peroxidase corresponding to spot no.  <dig> in the 2-d gels . avl  <dig> was not identified. avl  <dig> was a new protein identified as a pr4-type protein , which also contained a predicted signal peptide for the secretory pathway. since the mw of the pr4-type protein was below  <dig> kd, it was not resolved on the 2-d gels.

to find out whether the changes in the composition of the xylem were competent in attenuating vl <dig> growth, we isolated xylem sap from infected and non-infected oilseed rape and grew vl <dig> in pure xylem sap. figure 8a shows that fungal growth was significantly inhibited in xylem sap of infected compared to that of non-infected plants, whereas the protein concentration was unaffected .

discussion
stunting and defence responses are not caused by suppression of carbon assimilation or injury to nutrient or water supply
stunting occurred before v. longisporum colonized above-ground plant parts as reported previously  <cit> . our study clearly shows that neither these growth reductions nor beginning symptoms of chlorosis were the result of nutrient limitations or suppression of carbon assimilation. we have also no evidence that v. longisporum caused drought stress since the transpiration rate was unaffected in infected plants. this is in contrast to v. dahliae infections, which resulted in reduced stomatal opening in species like tomato, potato and egg plants and caused wilting symptoms  <cit> . eynck et al.  <cit>  observed that clogging of vessels after vl <dig> infection of oilseed rape occurred infrequently and only at late stages of infection. they assumed, therefore, that these rare obstructions would not affect gross water transport. our data corroborate this idea.

although the effect on carbon assimilation was either marginal or not present, both verticillium pathogens caused chlorosis . since chlorosis preceded fungal proliferation in leaves, it might have been caused by verticillium toxins as suggested earlier  <cit> . however, chlorophyll loss is also a common symptom of nutrient deficiencies. our study excludes the latter reason for v. longisporum infected oilseed rape. vl <dig> had also no effect on nutrient concentrations in arabidopsis thaliana leaves at early stages of stunting  <cit> . previous investigations with horticultural crops infected with v. dahliae neither revealed nutrient deficiencies  <cit> . therefore, we conclude that chlorosis is not the consequence of insufficient nutrient supply to leaves. notably, in our study the amounts of nutrient elements nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur were higher in older leaves of vl43-infected oilseed rape than in those of non-infected controls. increased phosphorus or nitrogen concentrations have also been reported in v. dahliae infected tomato, eggplant and in vl43-infected arabidopsis  <cit>  suggesting a yet unknown interference of verticillium with p or n metabolism.

vital functions related to nutrition, water supply and photosynthetic carbon assimilation were not compromised – at least not during infection stages when verticillium was still retained in the root system. therefore, we presume that the observed up-regulation of defence proteins must have been a pathogen-specific effect rather than an unspecific general stress response.

the extracellular proteome and its role in defence against verticillium longisporum
a previous proteomic study of oilseed rape xylem proteins revealed about  <dig> spots;  <dig> of these yielded peptide sequences and were putatively identified by matches with database entries as enzymes related to defence and cell wall re-modelling including, e.g., peroxidases, proteases, chitinases, β- <dig> -glucanases, germin-like proteins, pr <dig> protein, thaumatin-like protein, lectins, glycine-rich proteins, polygalacturonases, etc.  <cit> . we detected  <dig> protein spots in the apoplastic proteome of rape leaves. since the focus of our work was on v. longisporum-responsive proteins, we analyzed only some of the unregulated proteins to document that apoplastic washing fluids were enriched in proteins with a signal peptide for the secretion pathway . among the identified proteins we confirmed the presence of chitinases, peroxidases, proteases, glucanases, germins, and some proteins involved in cell wall modifications in the leaf apoplast of healthy oilseed rape. a similar composition has also been reported for the apoplast and some cell wall-associated proteins of arabidopsis  <cit> . but some of the proteins present in leaf apoplast of oilseed rape or belonging to secreted proteins of arabidopisis  were not found in xylem saps  <cit> . among them were α-arabinofuranosidases that are members of a set of glycosidases required for degradation of polymeric substrates such as arabinan, arabinoxylan, and other polysaccharides, which are major components of plant cell wall hemicelluloses  <cit> . these enzymes provide many microorganisms with soluble carbohydrates that can be used as carbon or energy sources  <cit> . our study shows that these enzymes are part of the healthy apoplast and do not belong to the suite of primary responses to v. longisporum infection.

our proteomic analysis revealed that only 7% apoplastic proteins were differentially regulated in response to vl <dig> suggesting that verticillium evoked very distinct responses. all identified vl43-induced apoplastic proteins  are candidates already known to be involved in pathogen defence. for example, β- <dig> -glucanases belong to the pr- <dig> protein family and hydrolyse β- <dig> -glucans, major structural compounds of fungal cell walls  <cit> . rep et al.  <cit>  have also found a basic and an acidic glucanase in the xylem sap of tomato after infection with the vascular fungus fusarium oxysporum. infections with v. dahliae caused increased expression and activities of glucanases and chitinases  <cit> . the pr <dig> protein identified here was homolog to that of a pseudomonas syringae inducible pr <dig> protein of brassica rapa  <cit> . the expression of this gene was induced in b. rapa by ethylene but not by salicylic acid or methyl jasmonate  <cit> . in a. thaliana, expression of an ethylene-dependent pr <dig> protein was also increased after v. longisporum infection  <cit> . since arabidopsis mutants deficient in ethylene signalling  were more susceptible to v. longisporum, ethylene-associated signalling pathway appear to be involved in mediating verticillium resistance  <cit> . indeed, genevestigator analysis showed that the arabidopsis homologues of the endochitinase  and β- <dig> -glucanase  identified in our study were significantly increased after ethylene exposure. in other plant species, chitinases and glucanases were also induced by ethylene  <cit> . in summary, this suggests that ethylene plays a yet unresolved role in v. longisporum responses of oilseed rape.

overall, current studies suggest that the pr-response to v. longisporum is relatively conserved across different brassicaceae . some of these proteins  appeared in xylem sap even before fungal infection had overcome the hypocotyl barrier. moreover, fungal growth in xylem sap of infected plants was massively inhibited . therefore, we suggest that xylem sap proteins may play a crucial role in the control of v. longisporum. since xylem elements consist of dead tissue, the sap proteins must either have been produced in roots or in parenchyma cells in the xylem such as ray cells. further studies must show whether the biosynthesis of these proteins is stimulated in roots, how they are loaded into the xylem and whether they serve to retain the fungus underground.

since the vl43-responsive proteins of xylem sap were also increased in the leaf apoplast, it is possible that they were transported with the ascent of sap into the leaf mesophyll, where they might have accumulated. however, the leaf apoplast of infected plants contained additional novel proteins  compared with the xylem sap. we suspect that the endochitinase found in leaf apoplast also originated from xylem sap because a protein with identical molecular weight was present in the latter. the increases in additional novel defence proteins in the leaf apoplast occurred before significant fungal proliferation in above-ground plant parts was apparent. this suggests that systemic signalling took place. it is currently unknown whether v. longisporum produced such signalling compounds, which might have been transported with the xylem sap. we can not exclude that the new xylem sap proteins themselves might have exerted signalling functions or that glucanase activities released elicitors from fungal cell walls which might have stimulated defence reactions in the leaf. this will require further analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion our data show that v. longisporum-induced stunting of oilseed rape was not caused by nutrient limitations, reduced water supply or suppression of photosynthesis. although v. longisporum had not yet overcome the hypocotyl barrier, proteomic analysis of the leaf apoplast revealed activation of pathogen defence enzymes . this suggests systemic signalling of v. longisporum infection. a subset of the defence enzymes identified in leaf apoplast was also increased in xylem sap. since orthologs of these enzymes in other plant species were regulated by ethylene, this phytohormone appears also to be involved in mediating v. longisporum responses in oilseed rape. the xylem sap of infected plants suppressed fungal proliferation compared with that of non infected plants suggesting that the activation of apoplastic defences contributes to limit fungal spreading.
