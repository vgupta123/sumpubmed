BACKGROUND
neem tree is one of the richest reserves of secondary metabolites, mainly tetranortriterpenoids , which are known to be responsible for insecticidal and wide pharmaceutical activities  <cit> . various parts of this evergreen tree have been used as traditional medicine in day-to-day household remedies from ancient time. in addition to its therapeutic potential, neem is being widely used in eco-friendly commercial pesticides and agrochemicals . over  <dig> structurally complex, highly oxygenated and skeletally diverse tetranortriterpenoids  <cit>  have been isolated and characterized from different parts of the tree. depending on the skeletal modifications, they can be categorized into two groups; ring-intact  triterpenoids and c-seco triterpenoids  <cit> . ring-intact triterpenoids encompass  <dig> ,8-trimethyl-17-furanylsteroidal skeleton such as azadirone, azadiradione, and gedunin  type of structures . c-seco triterpenoids are generated by the opening and further rearrangements of c-ring thus producing nimbin, salannin and azadirachtin  type of skeletons . although the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of triterpenoids  in neem plant has been predicted  <cit>  genes involved in triterpenoid biosynthesis have not been characterized till date  <cit> .fig.  <dig> skeletal diversity of neem triterpenoids. basic triterpenoids have azadirone, azadiradione, and gedunin type of skeletons. c- seco triterpenoids have nimbin, salannin and azadirachtin type of skeletons

secondary metabolites are the final outcome of omics cascade and their distribution pattern is typical characteristic of every life in nature, which can be considered as an intrinsic signature of that species. targeted metabolomics is all about identification and quantification of known metabolites and their time and space resolved distribution in a specific biological system . hyphenated mass spectrometry is a powerful and most utilized analytical technique in metabolomics due to its high sensitivity, accuracy, resolution, low sample requirement and ability to monitor broad range of metabolites . triterpenoids in neem are diverse in skeletal architecture, huge in count and their abundance is highly tissue-specific  <cit> . except few discrete studies  <cit> , there are no systematic investigations on the tissue- and stage-specific quantitative variation of neem triterpenoids. it will be of great importance to investigate the targeted metabolic profiling of major triterpenoids in neem plant, which may enlighten the differential tissue specific abundance of skeletally diverse triterpenoids. further, correlation of metabolic profiling with transcriptome helps in analysis and identification of genes involved in neem triterpenoid biosynthesis.

terpenoid biosynthesis starts with basic building blocks such as isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate  which are in turn synthesized through the mevalonate  or methylerythritol phosphate  pathways  <cit> . allylic diphosphate, dmapp undergoes condensation with one or more ipp in head-to-tail fashion to produce linear diphosphates such as geranyl diphosphate , farnesyl diphosphate  and geranylgeranyl diphosphate  catalyzed by short-chain prenyltransferases such as geranyl diphosphate synthase , farnesyl diphosphate synthase  and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase , respectively . two molecules of fpp undergo 1-1' head to head condensation to form squalene via nadph dependent reduction of presqualene diphosphate intermediate catalyzed by squalene synthase   <cit> . thus squalene is the first committed precursor for the biosynthesis of triterpenoids  <cit> . this molecule is also well known to serve as a precursor for the primary metabolites such as steroids required for cell growth and division. squalene thus acts as an important intermediate governing the balance between primary and secondary metabolism. squalene undergoes further oxidation to form  <dig> -epoxysqualene mediated by squalene epoxidase, followed by cyclization catalyzed by triterpene cyclases to form basic triterpene skeletons  <cit> . structural diversity of triterpenoids arises from the modifications of functional groups and rearrangements on the parental backbone of these triterpenes   <cit> .

short-chain prenyltransferases, such as fds and sqs are shown to play key regulatory role in triterpenoid and phytosterol biosynthesis. to show some instances, when hairy root culture of panax ginseng was treated with methyl jasmonate  to enhance the production of triterpenoids, fds was up-regulated  <cit> . over expression of mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase and fds in panax ginseng hairy root culture resulted in increased accumulation of phytosterols and triterepenes  <cit> . in centella asiatica, overexpression of panax ginseng fds resulted in overexpression of dammarenediol synthase and cycloartenol synthase and when induced with mj, enhanced production of triterpenes was observed  <cit> . similarly, overexpression of sqs in panax ginseng, eleutherococcus senticosus, withania coagulans and arabidopsis thaliana showed increased production of phytosterols and triterpenoids . therefore, identification and functional characterization of short-chain prenyltransferases and sqs will assist in understanding of triterpenoid biosynthesis.

in this study, fifteen major triterpenoids were quantified in six different neem tissues including kernel, pericarp, flower, leaf, stem and bark using uplc-esi-hrms based targeted profiling. tissue specific profiling of triterpenoids delineated the variation in the abundance of triterpenoids across various tissues. this information was further utilized for the selection of tissues for transcriptome analysis followed by identification of initial genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis. amongst the predicted genes from this pathway, here we report, molecular cloning and functional characterization of full-length geranyl diphosphate synthase , farnesyl diphosphate synthase  and squalene synthase  from neem. furthermore, using real-time pcr analysis, we showed that the expression level of one of the important genes in the pathway, aisqs correlates with the triterpenoid content in respective tissues .

RESULTS
tissue specific quantitative profiling of triterpenoids
the levels of individual fifteen triterpenoids  were determined in different tissues of neem including flowers, leaves, stem, bark, five developmental stages of pericarp and three stages of kernel . the developmental stages of the fruits were classified on the basis of kernel formation, weight, hardness and colour . the crude mixture of triterpenoids was extracted from fresh tissues of neem using solvent partition technique and were analyzed by uplc-esi-hrms in a gradient solvent program of methanol-water. amount of crude extract obtained was directly correlated with the triterpenoid content of the corresponding tissue . quantification of the crude extract revealed that kernel of stages  <dig> and  <dig> contained the highest amounts of triterpenoids  followed by pericarp of stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . pericarps of stages  <dig>   <dig> and kernel of stage  <dig> were found to possess comparatively lower amount of triterpenoids in the range of ~25-35 mg/g. flowers and leaves have been shown to contain  <dig> and 45 mg/g of triterpenoids , while stem and bark furnished  <dig> and 10 mg/g of the tissue respectively.

standard graphs were prepared for each of the fifteen isolated triterpenoids within the concentration range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/ml with injection volume 5 μl in uplc-esi-hrms . they were further utilized for the quantification of individual molecules in the extracts of different tissues of neem by correlating with the area under respective peaks of extracted ion chromatograms . the quantitative level of individual fifteen triterpenoids across various tissues of neem has been represented in additional file 1: figures s <dig> and s <dig>  among the fifteen triterpenoids under investigation, azadirachtin a , a well-studied neem triterpenoid was found to be highly abundant in seed kernels, especially in the stages  <dig> and  <dig> . pericarp, flowers and leaves showed 100- <dig> fold lower levels  of azadirachtin a as compared to the kernel, whereas bark and stem contained negligible quantities . similar distribution was observed with the levels of azadirachtin b . highest level of azadirachtin b was observed in kernel of stages  <dig> and  <dig> , whereas pericarp and flowers showed 100- <dig> fold lesser amounts in comparison. stem and bark were found to possess negligible levels  of azadirachtin b. salannin  showed highest levels in kernel of stages  <dig> and  <dig> . salannin content was  <dig> fold less  in stem as compared to that in kernel. salannin content in bark was ~ <dig>  mg/g which was  <dig> fold lesser in comparison to seed kernel. flowers, leaves and pericarp showed negligible levels of salannin . highest percentage of 3-deacetylsalannin  was observed in kernel of stages  <dig>   <dig> and stem with  <dig>  mg/g of the tissue. other tissues showed traceable amounts of 3-deacetylsalannin. nimbin  was mainly present in kernels in the range of  <dig> - <dig>  mg/g and in negligible quantities in other tissues. 6-deacetylnimbin  was found to be present in kernel of stages  <dig>   <dig> and leaves . nimbinene  and 6-deacetylnimbinene , two pentanortriterpenoids exhibited similar pattern of distribution across different tissues. highest level was observed in seed kernels of stages  <dig>   <dig> and stem within the range of  <dig> - <dig>  mg/g. flowers and leaves showed minor quantity , whereas bark and pericarps exhibited negligible level. nimbanal  was present in higher level in kernel of stages  <dig>   <dig> and stem  and traceable levels were observed in other parts. salannol acetate  was found to be abundant in seed kernels and stem with ~ <dig>  mg/g and in other tissues in minor amounts. ring-intact triterpenoids  such as azadirone, azadiradione, epoxyazadiradione and gedunin were found to be present at higher levels in pericarps. azadiradione  showed highest level  in all five developmental stages of pericarps especially in the stages  <dig> and  <dig> , during which the seed kernel formation is about to start. these levels were about 100- <dig> fold higher than that in seed kernels  and flowers . other tissues contained negligible amounts of it . similarly, epoxyazadiradione  showed 400- <dig> folds higher level in pericarps  in comparison to that in the seed kernels  and  <dig> folds higher than in flowers . azadirone  was also found to be most abundant in all the developmental stages of pericarps  especially in the stages  <dig> and  <dig>  and flowers . leaves showed very less quantity  of  <dig> whereas other tissues contained traceable amounts . gedunin , a potent anti-carcinogenic triterpenoid was abundantly present in pericarps, especially in the stages  <dig> and  <dig> . negligible amount of  <dig> was present in other tissues . nimocinol , 6α-hydroxy derivative of azadirone was observed to be abundant in leaves ,  <dig> fold higher than flowers  and 50- <dig> times higher than pericarps . other tissues such as kernel, bark and stem showed very less amount of nimocinol .

metabolic profiling data  depicted the kernel to be rich in quantity and diversity of triterpenoids especially c-seco triterpenoids of azadirachtin , salannin , nimbin  and nimbinene  skeletons. however, pericarps were found to be rich in triterpenoids mainly consisting of ring-intact  structures such as azadirone , azadiradione , epoxyazadiradione  and gedunin . flowers and leaves showed relatively lower levels of triterpenoids and mostly of ring-intact skeletons . stem and bark contained very low levels of triterpenoids; majorly c-seco metabolites of salannin  and nimbinene  type. in essence, profiling data revealed c-seco triterpenoids  to be the major constituents of triterpenoid pool from seed kernel, stem and bark whereas ring-intact skeletons  were observed to be major metabolites of the triterpenoid content obtained from pericarp, flower and leaf.

transcriptome analysis
for extensive coverage, rna isolated from triterpenoid rich tissues such as fruit stage  <dig>  leaves and flowers were pooled and used for transcriptome sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig>  paired-end reads each of 72 bp length were generated by illumina ga ii platform.  <dig> , <dig>  high quality reads were obtained with more than  <dig> phred score and reads of low quality were trimmed and used for further analysis. total  <dig>  contigs were generated using velvet with a hash length of  <dig>  these contigs were given as input for oases to generate  <dig>  transcripts. the average length of transcripts obtained was 1331 bp and the n <dig> length was 1953 bp .table  <dig> summary of transcriptome sequencing and assembly



all the transcripts were submitted to blastx against non-redundant database available at ncbi with an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  where, a total of  <dig>   transcripts were annotated . pathway annotation was carried out by kaas  with arabidopsis thaliana  and oryza sativa japonica  as the reference database. out of the  <dig>  transcripts only  <dig> transcripts were assigned  <dig> unique ko numbers, which covered  <dig> pathways . virtual ribosome, a web based server, was used for finding the open reading frame  of transcripts.  <dig>  transcripts had an orf with length more than  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> transcripts without any orf . the peptide sequences of transcripts with length more than  <dig> amino acids were submitted to pfam analysis.  <dig>  transcripts were assigned different pfam ids. a total of  <dig> different pfam ids were assigned to the transcripts . based on transcriptome annotation, all the genes involved in triterpenoid back-bone biosynthesis from isoprene units  to triterpene cyclase were found . a total of  <dig> transcripts predicted as cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases and two transcripts as cytochrome p <dig> reductases were identified. based on blast results, with reference to arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome p <dig>  neem cyp450s were classified into  <dig> families and  <dig> subfamilies, out of which most of the cyp <dig> belonged to cyp <dig> family. seven transcripts were related to plant steroid biosynthesis and six transcripts related to triterpenoid biosynthesis were predicted . recently, neem draft genome and transcriptome of fruit, stem, leaf and flower  <cit> , and suppression subtractive hybridization of transcripts between fruit mesocarp and endocarp  <cit>  have been reported. however, there are no reports regarding functional characterization of the genes involved in neem triterpenoid biosynthesis. to further explore this pathway, two short-chain prenyltranferases and squalene synthase were selected for functional characterization based on the transcriptome data.fig.  <dig> functional annotation of transcriptome;  based on blastx analysis 80 %  transcripts had homologous proteins in ncbi nr database. b based on kaas analysis only  <dig>  %  transcripts were assigned  <dig> ko numbers. c based on virtual ribosome analysis  <dig>  %  transcripts had orf region length more than  <dig> amino acids and  <dig>  %  transcripts did not show orf region. d based on pfam analysis  <dig>  %  transcripts were assigned pfam ids



heterologous expression and functional characterization of short-chain prenyltransferases 
short-chain prenyltransferases function at the branching point of terpenoid metabolism and play regulatory role in the distribution of isoprene units into various terpenoids biosynthesis. in total,  <dig> short-chain prenyltranferases from neem transcriptome were identified . based on functional annotation studies, two geranyl diphosphate synthases , nine putative geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases  and one farnesyl diphosphate synthase  were identified. sequence analysis using blast indicated that neem_transcript_ <dig> was a homomeric gds and neem_transcript_ <dig> could be the smaller subunit of heteromeric gds. targetp analysis showed that both of these genes are localized in the mitochondria . for further study, neem_transcript_ <dig>  and neem_transcript_ <dig>  were selected for cloning and functional characterization.

the orf of aigds  was 1263 bp, which coded for a protein of  <dig> amino acids with theoretical molecular weight and calculated pi as  <dig>  kda and  <dig> , respectively. aigds had maximum identity with several plant characterized homomeric gdss such as 90 % identity to homomeric gds from citrus sinensis   <cit> , 86 % identity to gds from mangifera indica   <cit>  and 76 % identity to gds from catharanthus roseus   <cit> . the percentage identity matrix of aigds with other plant homomeric gds and heteromeric gds larger subunits indicated that aigds possesses 71 % to 89 % identity with homomeric gds . the multiple sequence alignment of aigds consisted of two aspartate rich motifs ddxd and ddxxd which are highly conserved motifs in prenyltransferases and involved in substrate and metal ion binding . cxxxc motifs were not observed in aigds, which play a key role in the interaction of heteromeric gds  <cit> . the orf of aigds was cloned into pet32a expression vector having an n-terminal thioredoxin domain and subsequently expressed in bl <dig>  cells. however recombinant aigds protein was found in inclusion bodies. to enhance solubility, aigds cloned construct was transformed into lemo  <dig>  cells  <cit>  and expression was carried out. recombinant aigds protein remained solely in the insoluble portion in the pellet. eventually we were able to obtain soluble active aigds by re-suspending the pellets in lysis buffer, then drop-wise addition of  <dig>  m naoh until ph  <dig>  with constant swirling on ice till the solution became clear. the ph was then reduced to  <dig>  using  <dig>  m hcl under similar conditions  <cit> . the resulting solution was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g and subjected to sds-page analyses . the aigds was found to be in soluble form in the supernatant, which was subjected to purification by ni-nta affinity chromatography. the recombinant protein was over 94 % pure as analysed by sds-page . purified recombinant aigds was incubated with equimolar concentration of ipp and dmapp followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase to hydrolyze the diphosphate esters to their corresponding alcohols. the extracted assay mixture was analyzed by gc-ms and the products formed were confirmed by comparing the retention time and coinjection studies with standard geraniol . gc-ms analyses of the extracts of alkaline phosphatase treated assay mixture of aigds with gpp/fpp and ipp indicated that aigds failed to synthesize chain elongation products fpp  or ggpp  suggesting that aigds can catalyse the chain elongation reaction to produce gpp  as sole enzymatic product.fig.  <dig> total ion chromatograms  of aigds, aifds and aisqs assays and relative expression level of aisqs;  tics of aigds assays;  standard nerol,  standard geraniol,  co-injection of standard nerol and geraniol,  substrate control,  enzyme control,  aigds enzyme assay with ipp and dmapp as substrates,  co-injection of standard geraniol with aigds enzyme assay extract. b tics of aifds assays;  standard -farnesol,  ipp and dmapp substrate control,  enzyme control,  aifds enzyme assay with ipp and dmapp as substrates,  co-injection of standard -farnesol and extract of aifds enzyme assay with ipp and dmapp as substrates,  extract of aifds enzyme assay with gpp and ipp as substrates. c tics of aisqs assays;  standard squalene,  substrate control,  enzyme control,  extract of full length aisqs enzyme assay with fpp as substrate and nadph as co-factor,  co-injection of standard squalene and aisqs enzyme assay extract,  extract of truncated aisqs enzyme assay with fpp as substrate and nadph as co-factor and  co-injection of standard squalene and truncated aisqs enzyme assay extract



aifds  orf of 1029 bp length was found to be encoding for a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the theoretical molecular weight and pi for this polypeptide were  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  respectively. the sequence comparison of aifds exhibited 83 % identity with fds from mangifera indica   <cit> , 82 % identity with that from santalum album  and 81 % identity with fds from catharanthus roseus   <cit> . the multiple sequence alignment of aifds consisted of two aspartate rich motifs ddxd and ddxxd  which were highly conserved motifs in prenyltransferases. aifds was cloned into pet32a expression vector. the cloned construct was transformed into bl <dig>  cells and expressed. aifds was obtained as soluble form and purified by ni-nta affinity column chromatography. the recombinant protein was over 98 % pure as analyzed by sds-page . buffers used for aigds and aifds protein purification are given in addition file 1: table s <dig>  the purified short-chain prenyltransferase was incubated with dmapp/gpp and ipp followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. gc-ms analyses of the assay extracts indicated the formation of fpp which was further confirmed by comparing the retention time, mass fragmentation pattern and coinjection studies with standard -farnesol . further gc-ms analysis of alkaline phosphatase treated assay mixture of aifds with fpp and ipp did not show formation of geranylgeraniol indicating that aifds catalyses the chain elongation reaction to produce fpp as the sole enzymatic product.

heterologous expression and functional characterization of squalene synthase 
an orf of 1176 bp encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids was identified as aisqs . the theoretical pi of protein was found to be  <dig>  and molecular weight of 44 kda. the amino acid sequence of aisqs shared 86 % identity with squalene synthase from diospyros kaki , 85 % identity with camellia oleifera , 84 % identity with euphorbia tirucalli  and 84 % identity with that from glycyrrhiza glabra . eukaryotic sqss have four conserved regions and are important for catalysis as indicated by biochemical characterization of site-directed mutants and crystal structure of human squalene synthase  <cit>  . the aspartate rich motifs found in region  <dig> and  <dig> are involved in binding of the diphosphate moiety of fpp via bridging mg2+ ions. careful analysis of aisqs sequence with tmhmm program showed the presence of transmembrane motif ynttmiimlfiilaiifaylsan at the c-terminus. although transmembrane domain exhibits low level of sequence homology with other sqs enzymes, this domain is highly hydrophobic and consistent with the putative endoplasmic reticulum anchoring function.

squalene synthase has been characterized previously from human  <cit> , rodents  <cit> , plants , protozoa  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> . all these sqs enzymes were obtained in soluble form by deletion of a putative c-terminal membrane-spanning motif  <cit> . in the present study we have cloned the full-length orf of aisqs, as well as a truncated aisqs by deletion of  <dig> amino acids from n-terminal and  <dig> amino acids from the c-terminal end into prset-c and pet28c vectors respectively. the truncated aisqs was transformed into bl <dig>  cells, expressed and purified by subjecting to ni-nta affinity column chromatography. purified truncated aisqs was analyzed by sds-page which showed a single band  at ~35 kda, consistent with the predicted molecular mass for the 6-tagged enzyme .

the full-length recombinant aisqs protein was expressed in bl <dig> star  cells. majority of the protein was found to be insoluble . lee and poulter observed that adding glycerol to the lysis and purification buffers helped in solubilization of the insoluble t. elonatus bp- <dig> sqs  <cit> . induced cell pellets were disrupted in lysis buffer containing 50 %  glycerol and 1 % chaps. the glycerol concentration in cell lysate obtained was reduced to 20 %  by adding lysis buffer . this lysate was subjected to ni-nta affinity column chromatography. the purified full length aisqs, when analyzed by sds-page, exhibited a single band  at approximately 44 kda, consistent with the predicted molecular mass for the 6-tagged enzyme . purified proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °c until further use. buffers used for aisqs full length and truncated protein purification are given in addition file 1: table s <dig> 

gc-ms analyses of the assay extracts of full length and truncated aisqs with fpp in the presence of nadph indicated the formation of squalene. the formation of squalene was further confirmed by comparing the retention time, mass fragmentation pattern and co-injection studies with standard squalene . this confirms that aisqs catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate  to form squalene through a nadph-dependent rearrangement of c1′-2-3-linked triterpene intermediate, presqualene diphosphate  <cit> .

real time pcr analysis
to determine the role of short-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases and squalene synthase in triterpenoid biosynthesis, real time pcr analysis of the neem_transcript_ <dig> , aigds, aifds, and aisqs was carried out.

aisqs is the first committed enzyme involved in triterpene biosynthesis in neem. real time pcr was carried out for aisqs from flowers, leaves and fruit and normalized with 18s rrna expression level. neem fruit showed fivefold higher expression level in comparison with the leaves and tenfold higher relative expression level than flowers . the results were in correlation with profiling of triterpenoids from different tissues. neem fruits as a whole, not only showed structurally diverse triterpenoids but also showed very high levels of these metabolites. on the other hand, flowers and leaves exhibited lesser skeletal diversity and quantity of abundant triterpenoids. squalene is the precursor of primary metabolites such as membrane sterols and steroid hormones required for cell division and growth. also, it serves as precursor for triterpenoids found in neem, which assign squalene, a crucial branch point between primary and secondary metabolism. transgenic panax ginseng overexpressing squalene synthase has previously shown to produce higher levels of triterpene and phytosterols than wild type strains which depict the key role of intracellular squalene flux between primary and secondary metabolism  <cit> . high expression levels of aisqs in fruits indicated considerable amount of squalene flux might get diverted towards triterpenoids formation in neem fruits.fig.  <dig> real-time pcr analysis. a neem_transcript_ <dig> showed very high expression in flower. b aigds was highly expressed in leaf. c aifds has higher expression level in seeds. d relative expression levels of aisqs was very high in seeds as compared to other tissues. error bars represents standard error



aifds , compared to other tissues, showed very high expression levels in seeds. similar expression patterns of aifds and aisqs suggest that both these genes could be involved in triterpenoid biosynthesis. on the contrary, aigds  and neem_transcript_ <dig>  showed very high expression in leaf and flower, respectively, compared to other tissues. these results indicate that aigds may not be involved in triterpene biosynthesis in neem.

phylogenetic analysis
neighbour joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the deduced amino acid sequences of aigds, aifds and aisqs with corresponding enzymes from different organisms, which were retrieved from the ncbi genbank database . the degree of relatedness correlated well with the amino acid similarity among the plant proteins, which indicated aigds, aifds and aisqs belonged to the clade of plant kingdom. these enzymes from neem were classified into one cluster revealing their closest evolutionary relationships with the plant group.

CONCLUSIONS
due to immense significance of neem as a wonder tree and known to synthesize biologically and commercially important triterpenoids having highly complex carbon skeleton with diverse functional groups, it is of great interest to study their biosynthetic pathway. levels of total triterpenoid and fifteen major individual triterpenoids were quantified in various tissues of the neem plant. tissue specific variation in the abundance of triterpenoids has been observed. the mature seed kernel and pericarp of initial stages were found to contain the highest amount of triterpenoids. furthermore, a wide diversity of triterpenoids, especially c-seco triterpenoids were observed in kernel as compared to the other tissues. pericarp, flower and leaf contained mainly ring-intact triterpenoids. from transcriptome analysis, short-chain prenyl trasnferases, squalene synthase, squalene expoxidase, triterpene synthases and putative cytochrome p <dig> genes were predicted. the genes involved in the initial steps of isoprenoid biosynthesis, such as aigds, aifds and aisqs were cloned and functionally characterized. furthermore, aifds and aisqs expression levels were found to be nicely correlating with the triterpenoids content of various tissues of neem.
