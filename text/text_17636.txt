BACKGROUND
gibberellins  are a group of plant secondary products based on the diterpenoid ent-gibberellane skeleton; a small subset of bioactive gas such as ga <dig> and ga <dig> act as plant hormones and participate in a wide range of developmental processes. although classically involved in the promotion of growth processes such as germination and stem elongation, ga signalling has also been shown to be important in root elongation  <cit> , lateral root formation  <cit> , skotomorphogenesis  <cit> , cambial activity  <cit> , leaf expansion  <cit> , trichome development  <cit> , floral induction  <cit> , anther and pollen development , fruit growth  <cit>  and seed development  <cit> . furthermore, gas mediate environmental effects on growth and development through modulation of both biosynthetic and signalling components  <cit> . the central components of ga signalling, gras-domain proteins containing an n-terminal “della” motif that repress growth, also act as nodes in the interactions with several other plant hormones, including jasmonate  <cit> , brassinosteroids  <cit>  and strigolactones  <cit> . in short, gas play a central role in plant development and environmental responses, with impacts on crop yield and quality.

the importance of ga signalling in determining plant stature is clear from evidence in both wild and crop species showing phenotypic effects of genetic variation in ga biosynthetic and signalling genes. in wheat , semi-dwarfing alleles of the rht della genes were key to increasing yield during the green revolution as not only did the shorter stature protect against lodging under high fertiliser application rates, but also enhanced harvest index by reducing straw biomass and, in many genetic backgrounds, increasing grain numbers per ear  <cit> . in rice , a similar height phenotype was conferred by loss-of-function mutations in a key ga biosynthetic gene, osga20ox <dig>  <cit> , and there is evidence that semi-dwarfing of barley  by the sdw1/denso gene is associated with reduced expression of the orthologous hvga20ox <dig> gene  <cit> .

although rht semi-dwarfing alleles are widespread in modern wheat varieties, the involvement of rht in all ga responses results in pleiotropic effects on many other traits. for example, even mild alleles such as rht-b1b and rht-d1b impart reduced leaf area  <cit> . these alleles also have a strong effect on coleoptile elongation which prevents deeper sowing under dry conditions  <cit> . better targeting of the dwarfing effect to stem tissues might therefore confer significant advantages. in contrast to rht, the enzymes acting during the latter stages of ga biosynthesis are encoded by multiple paralogs with overlapping domains of expression and, in arabidopsis, mutations in individual genes have more localised effects  <cit> . this suggests that the characterisation of the ga biosynthetic genes of wheat has the potential to identify targets for the development of novel semi-dwarfing alleles with fewer undesirable pleiotropic effects than the current rht alleles.

gas are also thought to play a critical role in wheat grain development: endogenous ga levels are very high in developing grain and increase during grain expansion  <cit>  and wheat lines containing rht alleles have smaller grains  <cit> . despite grain size being an important component of wheat yield and quality, little is known regarding the spatial or temporal regulation of ga biosynthesis and signalling in the grain. a fuller understanding of the role of ga during grain development is required to engineer improvements in this trait in modern wheat varieties.

the ga biosynthetic pathway has been extensively characterized in both rice and arabidopsis , and the early genes in the pathway, from copalyl diphosphate synthase  to ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase  that produce the ga precursors ga <dig> and ga <dig> have also been identified and characterised in wheat  <cit> . the final steps in ga biosynthesis and inactivation are catalysed by soluble 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases  . ga 20-oxidase catalyses the multi-step oxidation of ga <dig> and ga <dig> to form the c <dig> skeleton, while ga 3-oxidase produces the final bioactive products, ga <dig> and ga <dig>  a third class of 2-odd, ga 2-oxidase, is involved in inactivation, with two sub-classes of enzyme that act against either bioactive gas  and their immediate c <dig> precursors   <cit>  or against c20-gas earlier in the pathway   <cit> . however, our knowledge of the size, structure and function of the gene families encoding these enzymes in wheat is limited.figure  <dig> principal reactions of the ga biosynthetic pathway in plants. enzymes are underlined; numerals after ga2ox genes indicate the class of enzyme as defined by lee & zeevaart . the bioactive gas are boxed



most of the evidence points to dynamic regulation of ga biosynthesis through regulation of the 2-odd genes which, in contrast to the terpene cyclase and cytochrome p <dig> genes earlier in the pathway  <cit> , are encoded by small multigene families  <cit> . although a small number of the 2-odds involved in the ga pathway of wheat have been identified previously  <cit> , this study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the paralogous and homoeologous genes encoding the enzymes in this crop species. in this report we identify and characterise the biochemical function of ga-biosynthetic 2-odd genes in wheat and demonstrate novel biochemical functions. we also catalogue the orthologous genes, where data is available, in durum wheat, barley and brachypodium distachyon. finally, we identify tissue-specific patterns of expression in wheat that suggest specialized roles in plant development for the different paralogs.

RESULTS
identification of wheat genes involved in ga metabolism
our strategy to identify the wheat complement of genes of the 2-odd class from the ga biosynthetic pathway, previously catalogued in rice  <cit>  is outlined in additional file  <dig>  and involved first identifying orthologous genes from brachypodium by blastp search at www.phytozome.org  using the rice peptide sequences as queries. coding sequences from the brachypodium genes were then used to blast partially-assembled genomic survey sequence from the international wheat genome sequencing consortium , generated by illumina sequencing of dna from individual wheat chromosome arms  <cit> . we were thus able to identify high-quality contigs containing wheat orthologs of many of the rice and brachypodium ga 2-odd genes.table  <dig> rice, brachypodium and bread wheat genes encoding 2-odds from the ga pathway

genes absent from, or incomplete in, the wheat genomic survey data were initially assembled from shotgun genomic reads of wheat cv. chinese spring  <cit>  located at http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net. the raw  <dig> reads were identified by blastn with the brachypodium cds sequences and assembled at high stringency; for most targets this resulted in the identification of genomic contigs covering the bulk of the coding region of the gene; however, the low genome coverage of the raw data, approximately 5x,  <cit>  coupled with the relatively high error rate of  <dig> sequencing and the hexaploid genome of wheat resulted in contigs that contained ambiguous bases and, in many cases, chimeric sequences derived from more than one homoeolog. hence, these consensus sequences were used in blast searches of the unassembled illumina data from individual chromosome arms  <cit> , followed by mapping the illumina reads to the  <dig> assemblies to generate homoeolog-specific sequences, as annotated in table  <dig> and, in greater detail, in additional file  <dig>  thus, across the ga20ox, ga3ox and ga2ox gene families, we were able to identify or assemble at least one complete homoeolog, and often all three, for most of the target 2-odd genes, as described in detail below. in addition, we identified or assembled wheat sequences encoding the ga 13-hydroxylase  biosynthetic enzymes and for the gid <dig> and gid <dig> signalling components.

the genomic survey data from bread wheat cv. chinese spring was complemented with assembled rna-seq data from tetraploid durum wheat  cv. kronos and the diploid progenitor t. urartu  <cit> . in addition, we identified, where possible, likely orthologs of each gene in the genomic survey sequences of t. urartu  <cit>  and aegilops tauschii  <cit> , the diploid progenitors of the a and d genomes, respectively, of bread wheat . homoeolog-specific sequences from the tetraploid species were assigned to the a or b genomes by blast to the bread wheat chromosome arm-specific genomic survey data above . finally, we identified likely orthologs of each of the wheat genes in barley , within the recent draft genome sequence of this species  <cit> .

structure and biochemical function of wheat ga 2-odd genes
we identified likely brachypodium orthologs for each of the four ga20ox genes, two ga3ox genes and ten ga2ox genes previously described in rice  <cit> . the only exception was ga3ox <dig>  which appears to be absent from brachypodium, as shown in table  <dig> and in the phylogenetic analysis presented in fig. 2b; however, this species contains two genes related to ga3ox <dig>  as discussed below. brachypodium also contains a tandem duplication of ga2ox <dig>  as neither hexaploid bread wheat, nor its tetraploid or diploid progenitors, possesses a fully-sequenced genome, we cannot be unequivocal about the number of ga 2-odd genes present in wheat. however, with the exception of ga2ox <dig>  we identified in bread wheat at least one homolog of each brachypodium gene, and usually complete or partial sequence evidence of homoeologs on each of the three chromosomes. thus we identified in bread wheat four homoeologous sets of ga20ox genes, at least two sets of ga3ox genes and at least nine sets of ga2ox genes, as detailed below.figure  <dig> phylogenetic relationships between gibberellin 2-odd amino acid sequences from bread wheat , barley , rice , brachypodium  and arabidopsis thaliana . dotted lines indicate sequences used as outgroups for the rooted tree. scale bars indicate number of amino acid substitutions per site. a: ga20ox; b: ga3ox ; c: ga2ox. clades labelled i, ii and iii in panel c reflect classes of ga2ox as defined by lee and zeevaart 



ga 20-oxidases
phylogenetic analysis of the 2-odd genes showed that the grass ga20ox genes fall into four paralogous clades  each including one of the four rice ga20ox genes, osga20ox <dig> through osga20ox <dig>  the assignment of the wheat ga20ox <dig>  ga20ox <dig> and ga20ox <dig> genes to the corresponding rice groups is supported by syntenic relationships between rice and wheat chromosomes  <cit> . in contrast, ga20ox <dig> which was expected to be found on wheat chromosome group  <dig> based on its position in rice and brachypodium, was found on the three homoeologs of chromosome group  <dig>  <cit> . we also identified full-length or partial sequences for all ga20ox paralogs in the tetraploid and diploid wheat species and full-length coding sequences from barley . as previously reported  <cit> , phylogenetic analysis indicates that the four paralogs of ga20ox in grass species are not directly orthologous to any of the five paralogs identified in arabidopsis: four of the five arabidopsis genes lie in a single clade of the tree , suggesting that the expansion in paralogs of ga20ox occurred after the separation of the monocot and eudicot lineages.

we have previously reported the biochemical function of all three homoeologs of taga20ox <dig> by heterologous expression in the pet3d vector  <cit> . in this study, we present a similar characterization for taga20ox <dig>  taga20ox <dig> and taga20ox <dig>  we expressed the coding regions of one representative homoeolog of each of these three wheat paralogs as fusion proteins in e. coli  and demonstrated their ability to carry out the series of sequential oxidations of ga <dig> to ga <dig> . these results demonstrate that all four wheat paralogs encode fully active ga 20-oxidases .

ga 3-oxidases
phylogenetic relationships between rice, brachypodium, barley and wheat are less clear in the ga3ox gene family. neither brachypodium, barley nor either of the wheat polyploid species or their progenitors appear to possess a true ortholog of osga3ox <dig> . however, brachypodium and wheat possess likely orthologs of osga3ox <dig>  with three homoeologs in bread wheat as described previously  <cit> . similar sequences were also found for the a genome in t. durum , in t. urartu, ae. tauschii , and barley . brachypodium contains a second sequence, bradi4g <dig>  related to osga3ox <dig>  but the predicted coding regions of the genes from several accessions of this species at www.brachypodium.org contain a frame shift in exon  <dig> due to the apparent insertion of a g residue at nucleotide  <dig>  however, pcr amplification and sequencing of this region from b. distachyon bd <dig> genomic dna clearly showed the inserted base present in the database sequence to be an artefact. removal of g <dig> from the database sequence resulted in a complete open reading frame most closely related to bdga3ox2a   and bradi4g <dig> was therefore assigned as bdga3ox2b. heterologous expression of synthetic coding sequences of bdga3ox2a and bdga3ox2b in e. coli followed by incubation of bacterial lysates of these cultures with radiolabelled substrates showed that both brachypodium genes encode ga 3-oxidase enzymes, converting ga <dig> to ga <dig> .figure  <dig> hplc separation of incubations of ga3ox-like enzymes from wheat, barley and brachypodium with -ga substrates. a,b: taga3ox-b3; c,d: taga1ox-b <dig> ; e: hvga3ox2; f: hvga <dig> ox <dig> ; g: bdga3ox2a; h: bdga3ox2b. x-axis shows hplc retention time in while the y-axis is scaled such that the height of the largest peak of radioactivity is 100 %.



syntenic relationships and phylogenetic analysis  support the assignment of wheat ga3ox <dig> genes on the group  <dig> chromosomes as orthologous to rice ga3ox <dig>  however, in bread wheat we identified four further related sequences encoding potential ga 3-oxidases, all located on the long arms of the group  <dig> chromosomes, some of which were also found in the tetraploid and diploid species . phylogenetic analysis and the location on chromosomes 2al, 2bl and 2dl suggested that the three most closely-related of these four novel sequences probably form a homoeologous group  and therefore were named as taga3ox-a <dig>  taga3ox-b <dig> and taga3ox-d <dig> . near-identical sequences to the a and b homoeologs were identified in the durum wheat transcript assembly  <cit>  and a partial sequence from t. urartu was also identified; however, taga3ox <dig> was not found in the ae. tauschii assembly. the fourth novel gene, located on bread wheat chromosome 2bl and also identified in the durum wheat transcript assembly, was provisionally named taga3ox-b4; no homoeologs of this sequence were identified in the a or d genomes of wheat or in the a and d diploid progenitor species, although a similar sequence  had been previously identified in barley and annotated as hvga3ox <dig>  <cit> .

we have previously determined the biochemical function of the bread wheat ga3ox <dig> genes by heterologous expression of the cdnas in e. coli  <cit> : products from all three homoeologs converted ga <dig> to ga <dig> and ga <dig> to ga <dig>  demonstrating ga 3β-hydroxylase  activity. in this study we present the functional characterization of taga3ox <dig> and taga3ox <dig> through expression in e. coli of synthetic cdnas. when lysates from induced bacterial cells containing synthetic cdna constructs were incubated with ga <dig>  taga3ox-b <dig> was shown to encode a functional ga 3-oxidase, converting the substrate to ga <dig> , while expression products of taga3ox-a <dig> did not have any detectable catalytic activity; taga3ox-d <dig> was not tested as the chinese spring sequence contains a 7 bp insertion in exon  <dig>  indicating that this gene is unlikely to be functionally active.

an unexpected result was observed for taga3ox-b <dig>  which converted ga <dig> to a product with an hplc retention time different to that of ga <dig> . this product was analysed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy  and had a mass spectrum consistent with ga <dig>   <cit> , identifying taga3ox-b <dig> as a ga 1β-hydroxylase , the first time an enzyme with such a catalytic activity has been described. based on this result we propose to rename this wheat gene as taga1ox-b <dig> figure  <dig> reactions catalysed in vitro by homologs of ga3ox from bread wheat , barley  and brachypodium 



ga <dig> was originally identified in the endosperm of developing grains of bread wheat  <cit>  along with the more abundant 1β,3β-dihydroxylated form, ga <dig>   <cit> . to determine the likely sequence of reactions leading to the production of ga <dig> in grain, expression products of taga3ox-b <dig> and taga1ox-b <dig> were separately incubated with 14c-labelled ga <dig>  ga <dig> and ga <dig> in the presence of co-substrates and cofactors and the products analysed by hplc. the 3-oxidase enzyme, taga3ox-b <dig>  was active against both ga <dig>  and ga <dig>  whereas the ga 1-oxidase, taga1ox-b <dig> acted only upon ga <dig> , and not upon ga <dig> . this suggests that the order of reactions in developing wheat grains is ga9 → ga61 → ga <dig>  catalysed by taga1ox-b <dig> and taga3ox-b <dig>  respectively .

as reported above, we identified a published sequence in barley, annotated as hvga3ox <dig>  <cit>  but most closely related to taga1ox <dig> and taga3ox <dig>  and located on the syntenic barley chromosome arm, 2hl. we investigated the catalytic activity of hvga3ox <dig> and hvga3ox <dig> by heterologous expression of synthetic cdnas in e. coli as above. when incubated with ga <dig>  hvga3ox <dig> yielded ga <dig> , as expected for a ga 3-oxidase, whereas hvga3ox <dig> generated a product with an hplc retention time different from both ga <dig> and ga <dig>  gc-ms analysis of this novel product revealed that it was ga <dig>   <cit> , thus identifying hvga3ox <dig> as a bifunctional enzyme, a ga 3β,18-dihydroxylase . we therefore propose to rename hvga3ox <dig> as hvga <dig> ox <dig>  it has been previously shown that whereas developing grains of wheat accumulate 1-hydroxy-gas, grains from barley accumulate 18-hydroxy-gas including ga <dig>  and ga <dig>   <cit> . it therefore seems highly likely that hvga <dig> ox <dig> is the only enzyme required for the production of ga <dig> and ga <dig> from ga <dig> and ga <dig>  respectively, in developing barley grains, while biosynthesis of bioactive ga <dig> and ga <dig> from these substrates in the rest of the plant is catalysed by hvga3ox <dig> .

as phylogenetic analysis  suggested a close relationship between taga3ox <dig>  taga1ox-b <dig> and hvga <dig> ox <dig>  we investigated their chromosomal locations. all these novel genes are located on the long arms of the group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat and barley, respectively. to further refine the syntenic relationships, the popseq mapping data of wheat  <cit>  was interrogated and showed the contig containing taga3ox-a <dig> to be located on chromosome 2al at  <dig>  cm while taga1ox-b <dig> was on chromosome 2bl at  <dig>  cm; the contigs containing taga3ox-b <dig> and taga3ox-d <dig> were absent from the popseq data. predicted genes from the wheat contigs mapped to the same location as taga3ox-a <dig> and taga1ox-b <dig> were screened by blastn against the pseudomolecule of barley chromosome 2h  <cit> , on which hvga <dig> ox <dig> is located at  <dig>  mbp; 95 % of the wheat genes in the same mapping bin as taga3ox-a <dig> had a top blast hit on barley chromosome 2h within 3 cm of hvga <dig> ox <dig>  while 90 % of the genes co-locating with taga1ox-b <dig> also had a top blast hit within the same window. this suggests that taga3ox <dig>  taga1ox-b <dig> and hvga <dig> ox <dig> are in orthologous positions in the wheat and barley genomes and are likely to be derived from a common ancestral gene, as suggested by the phylogenetic analysis . similar blast searches of the rice and brachypodium genomes with the wheat genes flanking taga3ox-a <dig> and taga1ox-b <dig> did not identify any linkage to osga3ox <dig>  osga3ox <dig>  bdga3ox2a or bdga3ox2b.

ga 2-oxidases
ten ga2ox genes, osga2ox <dig> through osga2ox <dig>  have been described in rice ; although the biochemical function of some of the rice genes has been demonstrated by heterologous expression in e. coli , by transactivation in rice by t-dna insertion  or by ectopic expression in transgenic plants , most have not been fully characterised. based on phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences from a number of dicot species, lee and zeevaart  <cit>  proposed three structural classes of ga2ox enzymes. a phylogenetic analysis of ga2ox sequences from arabidopsis, rice, and brachypodium suggested that the grass enzymes can each be assigned to one of these classes . class i, exemplified by atga2ox <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  includes the rice and brachypodium paralogs ga2ox <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and -10; class ii contains atga2ox <dig> and - <dig>  and the grass paralogs ga2ox <dig> and -2; class iii is represented by atga2ox <dig> and - <dig> and the grass paralogs ga2ox <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  previous data suggest that most ga2ox enzymes in classes i and ii almost exclusively use c19-gas as substrates, while class iii enzymes reportedly metabolize only c20-gas.

in wheat, bioinformatic analysis of assembled and raw chromosome arm data revealed likely orthologs for each of the rice and brachypodium ga2ox genes  with the sole exception of osga2ox <dig>  which was not detected in any wheat species, or in barley . in bread wheat, t. urartu and ae. tauschii we identified an additional group of ga2ox genes on the homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes, that were most similar to taga2ox6; the bread wheat genes were named as taga2ox-a <dig>  -b <dig> and -d <dig> and we identified two further related paralogs in the bread wheat genome assembly, taga2ox-b <dig> and taga2ox-b <dig>  both on chromosome 4bl  and not detected in the a and d genomes.

in general, the chromosomal locations of the wheat ga2ox genes as indicated by the chromosome arm survey data was as predicted by synteny with rice  <cit> . however, ga2ox <dig> is located on rice chromosome  <dig> and the orthologous genes in wheat would be expected to be found on the group  <dig> chromosomes but instead are on the group  <dig> chromosomes . also, the a and b homoeologs of taga2ox <dig> and taga2ox <dig> were found on the long arms of the wheat group  <dig> chromosomes, as predicted from synteny with rice, but in both cases no homoeolog was found on chromosome 1d, although partial sequences with high nucleotide sequence identity  were identified in the ae. tauschii assembly . however, genes very closely related to taga2ox <dig> and taga2ox <dig> and to the candidate orthologous sequences in ae. tauschii were identified in the chromosome arm assembly for 5bl, and these genes were tentatively named taga2ox-d <dig> and taga2ox-d <dig> 

to confirm the biochemical activities of wheat ga2ox genes we expressed one representative of each paralogous group as a fusion protein in e. coli and tested for activity against c <dig>  and c <dig>  substrates. the activity detected in each bacterial lysate was as predicted by the phylogenetic analysis : taga2ox-d <dig>  -d <dig>  -b <dig>  -d <dig>  -d <dig>  -d <dig> and -d <dig> were all active against the c <dig> substrate, ga <dig>  while taga2ox-d <dig> and taga2ox-d <dig> were active against the c <dig> substrate, ga <dig>  ; no activity against either substrate was detected for any of the three homoeologs of taga2ox11; taga2ox-b <dig> and taga2ox-b <dig> were not tested. taga2ox-d <dig>  -b <dig>  -d <dig> and -d <dig> also further oxidised the ga <dig> product of ga <dig> to its catabolite, which is almost certainly derived by rearrangement of the ketone, 2-oxo-ga <dig>  formed by a second round of oxidation at c- <dig>  in contrast to most species, however, we found that some of the wheat enzymes showed markedly reduced substrate specificity towards c20- or c19-gas. notably, taga2ox-b <dig>  taga2ox-d <dig> and taga2ox-d <dig>  all from ga2ox class i by phylogeny , efficiently converted ga <dig> to ga <dig>  while taga2ox-d <dig>  a class iii enzyme, converted ga <dig> to ga <dig>  . taga2ox <dig>  also in class iii, showed partial activity against ga <dig>  producing an unidentified product with a retention time different to both ga <dig> and its catabolite.

transcript levels for ga biosynthetic and signalling gene expression in wheat tissues by rna-seq
to determine the relative expression levels of the wheat ga genes across the life cycle of wheat, we exploited a dataset of rna-seq samples derived from five different organs  each at three developmental stages of bread wheat cv. chinese spring, generated as part of the analysis of chromosome 3b  <cit> . the paired-end rna-seq reads were mapped to a transcriptome reference consisting of all the wheat coding sequences identified above together with non-redundant cdna sequences from the iwgsc wheat chromosome arm survey . mean fragments per kb per million mapped reads  values  for each homoeolog of each gene are presented in additional file  <dig> and histograms of expression levels of each gene family, summing the fpkm values from each homoeolog, are shown in fig.  <dig> figure  <dig> expression of ga biosynthetic and signalling genes in five bread wheat tissues each at three developmental stages. expression levels from each homolog were summed and then averaged across replicates, ± standard errors. a: early ga pathway genes; b: ga-biosynthetic genes; c: ga-inactivating genes; d: ga signalling genes. ga2ox11- <dig> represents the sum of all additional paralogs of taga2ox6: ga2ox <dig> - <dig>  and - <dig>  fpkm: fragments per kb per million mapped reads; z: zadoks developmental stage



the genes encoding the early enzymes in ga biosynthesis, catalysing the steps from ggdp to ga <dig>  were found to be expressed in all tissues and stages , although the homoeologous gene sets for tacps, taks, tako and takao were more highly expressed in the spike at anthesis than in most other tissues. the tako genes, particularly tako-d <dig>  also appear to be very highly expressed late in developing grain at zadoks stage  <dig> , although the physiological basis for this is unclear. ga13ox, which catalyses the 13-hydroxylation of ga <dig> to form ga <dig>  is encoded by two paralogs as in rice  <cit> . the homoeologues of taga13ox <dig> are more highly expressed than those of taga13ox <dig> in all tissues except mature spikes  and in most organs the ga13ox genes have their highest levels of expression in the most mature developmental stage sampled.

the biosynthetic 2-odd gene families, ga20ox and ga3ox, showed tissue specific expression profiles . taga20ox <dig> and taga20ox <dig> were the most highly expressed ga20ox genes in vegetative tissues, while taga20ox <dig> was highest in the spike at anthesis and taga20ox <dig> expression was very high in and almost completely restricted to expanding grain. taga20ox <dig> was the most highly expressed ga20ox in roots, whereas in leaves and stems taga20ox <dig> and taga20ox <dig> showed a contrasting pattern, with the former having higher expression early in development of the organ and the latter being higher towards tissue maturity. the tissue specificity of ga3ox paralogs was even more striking: taga3ox <dig> appeared to be responsible for ga biosynthesis in vegetative and floral organs, while taga1ox-b <dig> and taga3ox <dig> were expressed at a very high level and almost exclusively at the mid-way stage of grain development, although taga1ox-b1also showed some expression in roots .

the ga2ox gene family, responsible for ga inactivation, showed variation in expression between both genes and tissue/time points . several genes had very low or undetectable expression: no transcripts from taga2ox <dig> homoeologs were found in any tissue and taga2ox <dig> was expressed at very low levels. the only transcripts detected from the novel wheat paralogs related to taga2ox <dig> were found in mature leaves, from taga2ox-b <dig> . taga2ox <dig>  taga2ox <dig> and taga2ox <dig> were the most highly expressed ga2ox genes overall, contributing most to ga2ox levels in roots, leaves and stems, while taga2ox <dig> was the most highly expressed ga2ox in the developing spike. in addition, several other ga2ox genes, namely taga2ox <dig>  taga2ox <dig>  taga2ox <dig> and taga2ox <dig>  also contributed to ga2ox transcript levels in the spike at anthesis . taga2ox <dig> was by far the most highly expressed ga2ox in developing grain, with some contribution from taga2ox <dig> at the earliest stage of grain development.

we also investigated expression of the ga signalling components tarht, tagid <dig> and tagid2: these genes were expressed in all tissues studied . the genes encoding the ga receptor, tagid <dig>  were most highly expressed in roots, mature leaves and elongating stems while tagid <dig> expression was highest in roots. tarht showed relatively little variation in expression except for a lower level in expanding grain.

there were some noticeable differences between expression levels of homoeologs for each of the studied genes, as shown in additional file  <dig>  in general, where one homoeolog was expressed at a significantly higher or lower level than the other two homoeologs, this was reflected across most of the  <dig> tissue/time samples, as has recently been described for homoeologous gene expression in grain tissues  <cit> . however, there were clear exceptions to this rule: for example, tako-a <dig> was most highly expressed in nearly all vegetative, spike and grain samples, but tako-d <dig> dominated in late grain development. similarly, tacps-a <dig> showed the lowest level of expression in most vegetative tissues, but was higher in most reproductive tissues.

to support the expression patterns determined by rna-seq analysis in bread wheat we developed qrt-pcr assays for all the biosynthetic and signalling genes . as we did not have access to the tissue samples used for the rna-seq analysis, we assessed transcript levels in existing samples of rna from shoot, root, grain and spike tissues in the tetraploid  wheat cv. kronos  <cit> . redundant primers were designed to amplify both a and b homoeologous copies of each gene where both sequences were known. additional file  <dig>  shows the distribution of expression of each paralog between tissues. the results of this analysis broadly reflect the rna-seq analysis above: in particular, taga20ox <dig>  taga1ox <dig> and taga3ox <dig> transcripts were detected almost exclusively in grain tissues. taga20ox <dig> and taga20ox <dig> were expressed in vegetative tissues, mainly the shoot, although appreciable levels of taga20ox <dig> were also found in this tissue as well as in the spike. as with the rna-seq analysis taga3ox <dig> was expressed in root, shoot and spike tissues but at a much lower level in grain. there was also reasonably good agreement in the expression profiles of the ga2ox genes: the qrt-pcr showed taga2ox <dig> expression to be highest in roots, taga2ox <dig> highest in shoots, taga2ox <dig> highest in grain, while taga2ox <dig> and taga2ox <dig> expression was highest in the spike.

expression patterns of brachypodium ga genes
to gain insight into conservation of expression patterns between members of the grass family, we accessed rna-seq reads from brachypodium distachyon bd <dig>  <cit>  and mapped them to the brachypodium reference transcriptome from ensembl plants . this revealed a high degree of conservation of expression pattern between this species and wheat : as in wheat, bdga20ox <dig> and bdga20ox <dig> were most highly expressed in vegetative tissues, while bdga20ox <dig> expression was highest in developing seed. notably, bdga20ox <dig> expression was highly expressed in anthers, suggesting that the high level of taga20ox <dig> expression observed in wheat spikes close to anthesis  may also have been in this organ. also, while bdga3ox2a expression was confined to vegetative tissues, anthers and developing embryos, bdga3ox2b was expressed predominantly in developing seed tissues, specifically the endosperm . the expression profiles of the ga2ox gene family were somewhat less well conserved between brachypodium and wheat, although ga2ox <dig> and ga2ox <dig> were major contributors in both species. the highest level of ga2ox expression was in the pistil , anther  and in the embryo  and endosperm  of developing seeds .

ga gene expression patterns in developing wheat grain
the above results demonstrated that the developing wheat grain exhibits high expression levels of ga biosynthetic and signalling genes, including the novel ga 1-oxidase taga1ox-b <dig>  to investigate further these patterns of expression within the expanding grain, we generated a set of rna-seq reads from tissue layers of developing grains of bread wheat cv. holdfast at 12 days post-anthesis: the endosperm, the inner seed coat/pericarp layer  and the outer pericarp layer of immature grain, consisting of the mesocarp parenchyma, hypodermis and epidermis . these tissue distributions were confirmed using known cell-specific gene expression patterns , although it is likely that there is some cross-contamination of the samples from adjacent layers. single-end rna-seq reads were mapped to the wheat transcriptome reference described above , and average rpkm  values for each gene from three biological replicates were calculated. the results in fig.  <dig> represent combined counts from a, b and d homoeologs, while expression values for individual genes are presented in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> expression of ga biosynthetic and signalling genes in different layers of the developing bread wheat grain at 10 days post anthesis. expression levels from each homolog were summed and averaged across replicates, ± standard error. tissue layers are as defined in additional file  <dig> . ga2ox11- <dig> represents the sum of all additional paralogs of taga2ox6: ga2ox <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  rpkm: reads per kb per million mapped reads



taken together, rpkm expression values validated those of the whole grain sample from the previous experiments, showing that the early ga biosynthetic genes tako and takao were highly expressed in the grain and that taga20ox <dig>  taga20ox <dig>  taga3ox <dig>  and taga2ox <dig> account for the majority of ga 20-oxidase, ga 3-oxidase, and ga 2-oxidase expression, respectively. taga1ox-b <dig> was also highly expressed in grain. the three ga signalling genes assayed, tagid <dig>  tagid <dig> and tarht, were all expressed in the grain. however, there were very clear distinctions in expression levels of these genes between different grain tissue layers.

while the cyclase genes, tacps and taks, were expressed in all three grain layers, tako and takao were more highly expressed in the endosperm and inner pericarp than in the outer layer. in stark contrast, transcripts of both paralogs of taga13ox were absent from the endosperm and concentrated in the outer pericarp. the later ga biosynthetic genes taga20ox <dig> and taga3ox <dig>  and also the novel taga1ox gene, were found to be more highly expressed in the endosperm than in the seed coat/pericarp layers and, within the seed coat/pericarp, more highly in the inner layer than the outer layer . taga20ox <dig> was an exception to this trend, showing highest levels of expression in the outer pericarp layers. a contrasting trend was observed for the ga catabolic gene taga2ox <dig>  which was expressed at negligible levels in the endosperm, but at higher levels in the seed coat/pericarp tissues and highest in the inner layer . the ga signalling genes tagid <dig>  tagid <dig> and tarht were expressed almost exclusively in the seed coat/pericarp layers, almost no expression being detected in the endosperm. tagid <dig> and tarht were also predominantly expressed in the outer of the two seed coat/pericarp layers.

discussion
2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases in the ga pathway of wheat
since gas contribute to nearly every stage of plant development, modifying their biosynthesis, perception and turnover has great potential to engineer improved varieties of agriculturally important crops. a prerequisite for such an approach is a more complete description and characterization of the components of the ga biosynthesis and signalling pathways. in the current study, we describe the sequence and biochemical activity of the ga20ox, ga3ox and ga2ox gene families in wheat, building upon a previous study which described the genes encoding the enzymes catalysing the earlier stages of ga biosynthesis in wheat  <cit> . while the absence of a fully-sequenced wheat genome precluded a precise determination of the final number of genes in each family, the transcript and genome assemblies used for this study cover a large proportion of the wheat genes  <cit> . for missing or incomplete genes, we also successfully reassembled chromosome arm-specific sequence reads onto consensus sequences derived from assembly of  <dig> reads, allowing us to further extend the coverage, and also illustrating the potential for improving the wheat genome assembly using existing short read sequence data. moreover, the number of 2-odd paralogs found in wheat are very similar to those described for both rice and brachypodium that have completely sequenced genomes, and in most cases we identified full-length or partial sequences for all three homoeologs, suggesting that the great majority of the genes from the ga pathway were identified in this study.

we identified or assembled full-length or partial sequences for all three homoeologs of four ga20ox genes in wheat , corresponding to the four characterized members of this family in brachypodium and rice . we confirmed that all four paralogs encode fully functional ga 20-oxidase enzymes, each capable of catalysing the complete series of reactions from ga <dig> to ga <dig>  we similarly identified wheat homologs of all but one of the ten characterized rice ga2ox genes and confirmed that representative homoeologs of each of the enzymes encoded by these genes have ga 2-oxidase activity against either c19- or c20-gas as substrates. however, these assays revealed that the substrate specificities of some of the wheat ga2ox enzymes do not conform to the current observations in other species where enzymes in classes i and ii, structurally-related to arabidopsis atga2ox <dig> through atga2ox <dig>  are active against c19-gas whereas enzymes related to atga2ox <dig> and atga2ox <dig>  are active only against c20-gas  <cit> . previously, the only identified exception to this pattern was the class i enzyme csga2ox <dig> from cucumber, which showed weak activity against the c20-ga ga <dig>  <cit> . however, this study shows that several of the wheat enzymes have broader substrate specificities: taga2ox-b <dig>  taga2ox-d <dig> and taga2ox-d <dig>  all from ga2ox class i by sequence similarity , were also active against c20-gas, while taga2ox-d <dig>  a class iii enzyme, was active against c19-gas . the significance of this wider substrate specificity is unclear, particularly since there do not appear to be distinct biological roles for the three structural classes of ga2ox enzymes or distinct class-specific expression profiles during development  <cit> .

in addition to the ga2ox genes in rice, brachypodium and barley, we identified five additional ga2ox gene sequences in wheat, comprising one homoeologous group on the long arm of the group  <dig> chromosomes, taga2ox <dig>  plus two more individual paralogs on chromosome 4b, taga2ox-b <dig> and taga2ox-b <dig>  all of these additional genes are closely related to taga2ox <dig>  suggestive of gene duplication events in the ancestors of wheat. the importance of these ga 2-oxidase genes to wheat development remains unclear, however, since expression of all three homoeologs of taga2ox <dig> was negligible in all tissues studied and none of the encoded enzymes could be shown to exhibit ga 2-oxidase activity. expression of the taga2ox-b <dig> and taga2ox-b <dig> paralogs was similarly very low in the assayed tissues.

of the three 2-odd families, the largest divergence from rice was observed in the ga 3-oxidases. the rice genome contains two ga3ox genes  <cit> ; the wheat genes orthologous to osga3ox <dig> were identified and characterized in a previous study and shown to act principally as ga 3-oxidases, but also with additional minor activities including ga 2-oxidase,  <dig> -desaturation and even 13-hydroxylation  <cit> . we did not identify a clear wheat ortholog of osga3ox <dig>  either in sequence homology or in syntenic position, and this gene was also absent from the brachypodium genome. instead, during the current study, we found novel ga3ox gene sequences in bread wheat, three of which were closely related to one another and most likely represent a homoeologous group  while a fourth gene, taga1ox-b <dig>  was identified only in the b genome ; orthologs of these genes were found in durum wheat but not in rice or brachypodium. of the ga3ox <dig> group, only taga3ox-b <dig> could be shown to encode an active ga 3-oxidase, converting ga <dig> to ga4; taga3ox-d <dig> contains a 7 bp insertion in the second exon and while taga3ox-a <dig> appeared to encode a full-length protein, no enzyme activity could be detected in the e. coli expression products. this might be explained by polymorphisms observed in this paralog that result in mis-sense changes in amino acid residues conserved between all grass ga3ox sequences , but technical problems with heterologous expression cannot be ruled out.

in contrast, expression products of taga3ox-b <dig> were found to catalyse 1β-hydroxylation of ga <dig> to yield ga <dig> , rather than the 3β-hydroxylation suggested by its similarity to other ga 3-oxidases. this is the first description of an enzyme with ga 1-oxidase activity, and the gene was therefore renamed as taga1ox-b <dig>  we found a single ortholog of taga1ox-b <dig> in durum wheat but not in the a genome or the a and d diploid progenitors, and little sequence data is available for ae. speltoides, the closest living relative of the b genome progenitor. however, a search of the draft barley genome  <cit>  identified two ga3ox-like genes: hvga3ox <dig> was shown to encode a ‘normal’ ga 3-oxidase  and had 95-96 % nucleotide sequence identity with the three wheat taga3ox <dig> homoeologs. in contrast, hvga3ox <dig>  <cit>  is most closely related to taga1ox-b <dig>  and is located on the orthologous chromosome arm in barley, 2hl. we showed that hvga3ox <dig> encodes a ga-3β,18-dihydroxylase, converting ga <dig> to ga <dig>  and was therefore renamed as hvga <dig> ox <dig> 

analysis of the popseq mapping data  <cit>  showed that both taga3ox-a <dig> and taga1ox1-b <dig> were in orthologous positions on the group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat to hvga <dig> ox <dig> on barley chromosome 2h. however, these genes are not orthologous to either osga3ox <dig> or osga3ox <dig>  which are located on rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, or to the two ga3ox <dig> variants in brachypodium, where are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> from that species. it seems highly likely, therefore, that the three triticeae-specific genes evolved from an unidentified common ancestor but have subsequently diverged, acquiring different catalytic activities. amino acid sequence identity ranged from 66 % between hvga <dig> ox <dig> and taga3ox-a <dig> to 79 % between hvga <dig> ox <dig> and taga1ox1-b <dig>  whereas amino acid sequence identity between the wheat and barley ga3ox <dig> enzymes responsible for bioactive ga production in vegetative tissues is 95–96 %. this suggests the existence of a strong purifying selection of mutations in the ga3ox <dig> genes compared with the genes of novel function identified here.

investigation of the expression patterns of these novel ga3ox-like genes showed that taga1ox-b <dig> is only expressed in the developing grain of both bread and durum wheat , predominantly in the endosperm  and that taga3ox-b <dig> shows a similar expression profile, although with some expression detected in vegetative tissues; the other homoeologues of taga3ox <dig> are also expressed in developing endosperm, but at a much lower level . similarly, inspection of the barley gene expression atlas at http://www.plexdb.org revealed that hvga <dig> ox <dig>  is only expressed in the endosperm of developing barley grains. supporting the expression and functional analyses described above, developing wheat grains accumulate 1β-hydroxylated gas, including ga <dig>  and ga <dig>   <cit> . given that we showed that taga1ox-b <dig> is active against ga <dig> but not ga <dig>  whereas taga3ox-b <dig> is active against both ga <dig> and ga <dig> , the order of reaction in planta is likely to be ga9 → ga61 → ga <dig>  catalysed by taga1ox-b <dig> and taga3ox-b <dig>  respectively , and it seems likely that these two enzymes also produce the 13-hydroxylated equivalent, ga <dig>  from ga <dig> in developing grain via the same sequence of reactions. in contrast, 1-hydroxy-gas have not been identified in developing barley grains, which accumulate a number of 18-hydroxylated gas, including ga <dig>   <cit> , presumably produced through the action of hvga <dig> ox <dig> on ga <dig> .

tissue specificity of ga biosynthesis, signalling and turnover in wheat
our survey of ga gene expression in five tissues of bread wheat each at three stages of development  and also different tissues of durum wheat  and brachypodium  indicated that all organs and time points were competent in ga biosynthesis, perception and inactivation, exhibiting measurable transcript levels for at least one paralog of each component assayed. one caveat to consider when drawing conclusions from ga biosynthetic expression data is the existence of feedback and feed-forward mechanisms which act upon the transcription of 2-odd genes. as part of a homeostatic mechanism, increased concentrations of bioactive ga inhibit ga20ox and ga3ox expression and promote ga2ox expression  <cit> . therefore, high expression of ga biosynthetic genes is not necessarily indicative of higher endogenous bioactive ga levels and may instead result from their up-regulation under conditions of low ga. the early biosynthetic genes, tacps, taks, tako and takao, and the signalling genes tarht, tagid <dig> and tagid <dig>  are expressed at all stages of development, albeit with marked variation in transcript levels between tissues and stages. however, it is clear that the multiple paralogs of the 2-odd genes encoding ga20ox, ga3ox and ga2ox have more specific patterns of expression. in particular, the expression of taga20ox <dig>  taga3ox <dig> and taga1ox <dig> is very high in the grain, specifically at zadoks  <dig> developmental stage, but is much lower in the other tissues assayed. this is similar to the expression patterns observed for osga20ox <dig> and osga3ox <dig> in rice  <cit> , although no wheat ortholog of osga3ox <dig> was identified; osga20ox <dig> and taga20ox <dig> are similarly not orthologous by chromosome location, although the phylogenetic relationship appears clear .

in the leaf and stem, taga20ox <dig> is expressed more highly in early, rapidly-elongating stages of development while taga20ox <dig> appears to be highest in more mature tissue, after the period of maximal elongation growth , implying that taga20ox <dig> might be more important in determining growth rate and therefore final organ size. however, both paralogs of these two genes contribute to plant height in rice  <cit> , although only osga20ox <dig>  has been exploited in plant breeding  <cit> . taga20ox <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are also expressed to some extent at all stages of spike development, a result consistent with a recent study which showed that these three ga biosynthetic genes are up-regulated by long days in the shoot apical meristem of wheat, where bioactive ga is required for the up-regulation of floral meristem identity genes soc1- <dig> and lfy in spike development  <cit> . relatively few genes from the ga2ox family show high levels of expression in the tissues assayed, and some have narrow expression domains. thus taga2ox <dig>  taga2ox <dig> and taga2ox <dig> account for most of the vegetative ga2ox expression, while taga2ox <dig> and taga2ox <dig> predominate in the flowering spike and taga2ox <dig> in developing grain.

analysis of ga gene expression in separate tissue layers of the developing grain revealed that the ga biosynthetic genes, notably tako, taga20ox <dig>  taga3ox <dig> and taga1ox <dig>  were predominantly expressed in the endosperm. in contrast, genes involved in ga perception, signalling and turnover were expressed at only low levels in the endosperm and were instead expressed at their highest levels in the inner and outer seed coat/pericarp layers. indeed, expression levels of the ga receptor, tagid <dig>  and the central signalling component, tarht, were 26- and 22-fold higher, respectively, in the outer pericarp than in the endosperm . these results suggest that the main site of ga biosynthesis in the young developing grain is the endosperm tissue while ga signalling occurs predominantly in the outer layers of the wheat grain, possibly implying movement of bioactive gas between the tissues. as this period of grain development, zadoks  <dig>  is one of rapid radial expansion growth, it is tempting to speculate that bioactive ga produced by the endosperm promotes cell expansion in the outer grain layers which otherwise would constrain growth of the endosperm. in support of this, dwarfing mutations in tarht genes that reduce sensitivity to bioactive gas also reduce grain size  <cit> , implying a role for gas and ga signalling in grain expansion.

however, no defined role for ga in seed development has been demonstrated in any species. although developing seeds of plants often accumulate high levels of gas, in many cases these are inactive or partially active forms. thus, in rice the osga3ox <dig> gene that is expressed in developing grain encodes an enzyme with both 3β-hydroxylase and 2β-hydroxylase activities  <cit> , although the latter activity is a minor component, at least when assayed in vitro. unlike the other sequenced grass species , wheat, barley and brachypodium lack orthologs of ga3ox <dig> but in each case have evolved novel paralogs of the ga3ox <dig> gene responsible for ga biosynthesis in vegetative tissues  that have high expression in developing grain. in the case of bread wheat, we show above that two novel paralogs, taga3ox <dig> and taga1ox <dig>  combine to produce the unusual gibberellin ga <dig>  in grain. similarly, in barley hvga <dig> ox <dig> encodes a bifunctional ga 3β,18-dihydroxylase; this gene is closely related to taga3ox <dig> and taga1ox <dig> and its expression is confined to developing grain. it is presumably, therefore, responsible for the accumulation of 18-hydroxy-gas, such as ga <dig> , in seeds of this species. brachypodium also contains a paralogous gene related to ga3ox <dig>  bradi4g <dig>  that we have named bdga3ox2b. this gene is similarly expressed exclusively in seed tissues  and encodes an enzyme with only ga 3-oxidase activity. thus, rice, barley, wheat, and brachypodium have independently evolved paralogs of ga3ox that produce high levels of gas in developing grain. however, the gas synthesized in wheat and barley grain exhibit reduced biological activity: ga <dig> is ~4-fold less active than ga <dig>  <cit>  and the biological activity of 1-hydroxy gas is similarly lower than of their non-1-hydroxylated equivalents . the biological relevance of these unusual ga-modifying activities is therefore unclear and merits further investigation.

target genes for novel dwarfing effects in wheat
the introduction of the rht dwarfing alleles during the green revolution had a major impact on global wheat productivity because of a reduced incidence of lodging and improved assimilate partitioning  <cit> . however, because rht is a negative regulator of ga signalling in all tissues, these alleles are also associated with negative pleiotropic effects, such as the requirement for planting closer to the surface and a slight reduction in grain size  <cit> . results from our study confirm that rht was expressed in all tissues assayed, including the outer layers of expanding grain and suggests that alternative dwarfing alleles, more specific and targeted to the stem, may limit these negative pleiotropic effects. several genetic studies to identify plant height qtls are being carried out in order to identify alternative dwarfing alleles for wheat, although to date no specific gene has been identified  <cit> .

one solution may lie in the selection of loss-of-function mutations in ga biosynthetic genes using currently available tilling populations  <cit> . in rice, the most widely used dwarfing gene is ga20ox <dig>  <cit> , where multiple loss-of-function alleles have been identified which reduce height. these mutations have only limited effects on reproductive development, presumably because other ga 20-oxidase genes regulate ga biosynthesis in these tissues. in wheat, taga20ox <dig>  taga20ox <dig> and taga20ox <dig> are expressed in the leaf and stem, suggesting that these are promising candidates in which to search for disruptive mutations. however, since all three homoeologs of both taga20ox <dig> and taga20ox <dig> are expressed in stem tissues  multiple mutations may necessary to obtain economically relevant height reductions. current efforts to sequence the exomes of wheat tilling lines  <cit>  is accelerating the discovery of mutations for most of the genes presented in this study, which will facilitate the experimental validation of their function and the testing of their effects on plant height and productivity.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified the genes encoding 2-odd enzymes from the ga biosynthetic pathway of bread wheat, through a combination of interrogation of publicly available, partially-assembled genome sequences and de novo assembly of shotgun reads from individual chromosome arms. we also catalogued the ga 2-odd genes from barley and brachypodium. with a few exceptions, hexaploid bread wheat contains three homoeologs of each paralog of the genes identified in rice. in each case the function of the enzymes encoded by the genes was demonstrated by heterologous expression and their expression was analysed across a range of tissues and developmental stages. certain paralogs of the ga20ox, ga3ox and ga2ox gene families were shown to be exclusively expressed in developing grain, including a novel, highly-expressed ga 1-oxidase gene in wheat endosperm . the presence of these genes likely explains the high levels of 1β-hydroxylated gas in wheat grain, and 18-hydroxylated gas in barley, in both cases the activities resulting in a reduction in the biological activity of the gas produced. the pattern of transcript accumulation of the ga genes in early developing grain suggested that, while most ga biosynthesis is carried out in the endosperm, ga inactivation, perception and signalling are confined to the seed coat and pericarp, consistent with a role for ga in grain expansion. this comprehensive identification and characterisation of the ga 2-odd genes in wheat will provide the basis for a better understanding of ga-regulated development in this species, including the involvement of ga biosynthesis and signalling in grain development.
