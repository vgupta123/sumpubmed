BACKGROUND
semi-dwarf genes were crucial in the green revolution because they conferred semi-dwarfness, which reduced lodging and increased crop yields . most of the green revolution semi-dwarf varieties resulted from a gene mutation in the gibberellic acid  pathways, e.g. rice sd <dig> gene, wheat della genes and maize d <dig> . for barley, the world's fourth leading cereal crop, semi-dwarf genes such as sdw1/denso, uzu <dig> and ari-e have been extensively explored and widely accepted in barley breeding programs in different regions. barley sdw1/denso varieties carry a mutation in ga  <dig> oxidase- <dig>  a ga biosynthesis gene that is homologous to rice sd <dig> , which has been used to develop short-stature cultivars in western usa, canada, australia and european countries . the uzu <dig> mutant had a significantly reduced response to brassinolide resulting from a missense mutation in the br receptor gene hvbri <dig> and has been widely used in east asia . the ari-e gene from golden promise is a commonly-used semi-dwarf gene in spring barley in europe, especially scotland. a new barley variety with the ari-e gene, hindmarsh, has been grown in nearly half of australia. besides the magnitude of the effect of this gene on reducing plant height, ari-e has significant effects on some agronomic traits, such as grain size, grain composition, malting quality and yield  <cit> . golden promise is a model cultivar for barley genetic transformation  <cit> . recently, some studies have reported that ari-e is the only semi-dwarf gene to improve salt tolerance . genetic analysis showed that ari-e was a recessive semi-dwarf gene and was mapped on barley chromosome 5h as a quality character or quantitative trait locus  using traditional markers and next-generation sequencing technologies  <cit> . however, the ari-e gene is yet to be identified.

map-based cloning is the most promising approach for molecular isolation of target genes. the first map-based cloning gene in barley was the powdery mildew resistance gene mlo  <cit> . a growing number of genes have been isolated from barley based on genetic information. eight genes are involved in disease resistance against powdery mildew  , stem rust   <cit> , barley yellow mosaic virus   <cit>  and leaf strip   <cit> . besides resistance genes, some of the genes identified by map-based cloning contribute to complex agronomic traits such as photoperiod sensitivity   <cit> , vernalization requirement   <cit> , row type   <cit> , tolerance to boron toxicity   <cit> , covered/naked caryopsis   <cit> , anthocyanin pigmentation   <cit> , floret closing   <cit> , awn length   <cit> , increased number of internodes   <cit> , leaf color variation   <cit>  and branch development   <cit> . a larger number of molecular markers are the basis of map-based cloning for genes related to complex agronomic traits. there are thousands of molecular markers  available for barley genomes , allowing an efficient and rapid localization of genes at low resolution. further narrowing of the target region and distinguishing which gene is responsible for the interested traits is limited by the size of the segregating population and molecular marker density.

recently, the ongoing revolution in sequencing techniques has significantly reduced costs and advanced technologies to provide new strategies for discovering thousands of markers. next-generation sequencing  facilitates the rapid identification of genomic variants for marker development in most species. for example, ngs identified  <dig>  markers in wheat  <cit>  and  <dig>  snp markers in cotton  <cit> . in barley,  <dig>  high confidence snps generated from genotyping by sequencing  were used to construct a linkage map of doubled haploid  golden promise × morex  rils population  <cit> . aligning genomic dna sequences between two sequenced barley varieties, morex and barke, identified  <dig>  indel markers  <cit> .

bulked segregant analysis  combined with ngs technologies offers new strategies for marker discovery associated with genes/qtls. specific-length amplified fragment sequencing  is considered an efficient and high-resolution genotyping method  <cit> , which has identified major qtls in maize  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and candidate gene isolation in cucumber  <cit>  and barley  <cit> . in this study, traditional marker assays and the combination of bsa with slaf-seq were used to detect a genomic region in barley harboring the semi-dwarf gene ari-e. snps and indel markers were developed by slaf-seq and whole-genome shotgun sequencing technology, respectively, to fine-map ari-e. the current study exemplifies the use of slaf-seq for snp discovery and whole-genome shotgun sequencing for indel development in the target region, which may pave the way for map-based cloning of the ari-e gene and unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the semi-dwarf phenotype.

RESULTS
classical mapping of the ari-e gene
according to previous linkage mapping, ari-e is located on chromosome 5h between ssr marker bmag <dig> and bmag <dig> in derkado × b83-12/21/ <dig> dh population  <cit> . twenty-nine indel markers in the target region developed by zhou et al.  <cit>  were tested in the parents of dash and vb <dig>  of these, six markers  showed polymorphism. based on the current barley assembly information, hvces <dig> , which is homologous to rice cellulose synthase catalytic subunit genes  <dig> , is also in the target region. after sequencing the hvces <dig> gene in dash and vb <dig>  there was 6 bp  insertion in its 5’untranslated region in vb <dig>  therefore, the indel marker of hvces <dig> was designed. two ssr markers were developed from the sequence of morex_contig <dig>  one of which was polymorphic between the parents. as a result, seven indel markers and one ssr marker  were used to genotype  <dig> individuals from the dash × vb <dig> dh population and to construct the linkage map . the ari-e gene was mapped as a phenotypic marker and was located to a region on chromosome 5h, delimited by m <dig>  and indelhvces <dig> . the flanking markers  interval corresponded to  <dig>  mb on the international barley sequencing consortium  physical map.table  <dig> pcr markers used to classical mapping

analysis of slaf-seq data and slaf tags
a total of  <dig> , <dig> fragments were procured, each with read lengths of ~100 bp . most of the bases  were high quality, with quality scores of at least  <dig> . the slaf numbers were  <dig>  for dash and  <dig>  for vb <dig>  the average depth of the slaf markers was  <dig> -fold in dash,  <dig> -fold in vb <dig>   <dig> -fold in the semi-dwarf pool and  <dig> -fold in the highpool. according to the results of slaf positioning on the barley genome,  <dig>  slaf tags were anchored; the slaf numbers and chromosome positions are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> statistic results of sequencing data for both parents and bulked dna pools





polymorphic snps and association analysis
after aligning the sequence data to the barley reference, snps that differed from the reference sequence were identified. at the stage of snp calling, each snp supported by at least four reads in semi-dwarf or high pools were filtered out and  <dig>  snp were detected. of these snps,  <dig>  snps were polymorphic between dash and vb <dig> and were ultimately selected for association analysis. the statistics of marker numbers on each chromosome according to the positioning result are shown in table  <dig>  the snp-index was calculated for each snp. an average snp-index of snps was calculated with  <dig> snp-indexes located in a given genomic interval. snp-index graphs were generated for the semi-dwarf  and high  pools by plotting the average snp-index against the position of each sliding window in the barley genome assembly. after combining the snp-index information into the semi-dwarf and highpools, the ∆ was calculated and plotted against the genome positions . according to the ibsc physical map, the candidate region on chromosome 5h between  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> was obtained with 99 % confidence.fig.  <dig> indentification of the semi-dwarf gene ari-e related candidate regions through snp-index association analysis. snp-index graphs of semi-dwarf pool  and high pool  and Δ  graph from slaf-seq analysis. x-axis represents the position of seven chromosomes and y-axis represents the snp-index




develop snp markers based on slaf-seq
after aligning the marker sequence to the barley physical map, the preliminary mapping region of ari-e, defined by m <dig> and indelhvces <dig>  corresponded to  <dig>  mb . combining the preliminary mapping and slaf-seq technology suggested that the overlap of both results was delimited by m <dig> and indelhvces <dig> and was the candidate region of the semi-dwarf gene ari-e. to further evaluate the accuracy of slaf genotyping data, snps which showed polymorphism between semi-dwarf and high pools, and were not segregated in each pool, were selected across the entire candidate region. selected snps with one genotype derived from dash and the other from vb <dig> were designated as potential markers. ultimately, eight snps and one indel  were identified after performing independent traditional sanger sequencing in dash and vb <dig>  their primer sequences and physical map positions are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> pcr primers, product size and physical position designed from slaf-seq strategy




develop indel markers by whole-genome shotgun strategy
there were  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads with a read length of at least 100 bp after resequencing the barley cultivar, hindmarsh. moreover,  <dig>  %  were mapped to the recently released barley reference genome assembly by population sequencing  methodology  <cit> . about  <dig>  million variations, including  <dig>  small indels, were identified in the whole genome. there were  <dig>   <dig> indels on chromosome 5h. according to the popseq assembly, the ari-e candidate region between m <dig> and indelhvces <dig> spans a total sequence length of approximately  <dig>  mb . therefore,  <dig> indels were selected to design primers in the ari-e targeted region . the size comparison of pcr products on page gels revealed insertion or deletion polymorphisms between dash and vb <dig>  ultimately, seven indels  showed size polymorphism between dash and vb <dig> table  <dig> pcr primers, product size and their physical position designed from whole-genome shotgun strategy




mapping the developed markers in the dash × vb <dig> dh population
fine-mapping with all of the polymorphic markers was performed in  <dig> dash × vb <dig> dh individuals . after independent traditional sanger sequencing, the markers derived from different slaf sequences correlated well with the slaf-seq genotyping information, suggesting that the markers mined from dash, vb <dig>  semi-dwarf and high pools are reliable. indel markers have unique amplicons and can be distinguished easily on 6 % polyacrylamide gel in the population. linkage analysis of  <dig> dash × vb <dig> dh individuals showed that all markers were assigned to the target regions, and  <dig> of  <dig> markers were mapped between marker m <dig> and indelhvces <dig> intervals. moreover, the indel- <dig> marker co-segregated with ari-e. accordingly, ari-e was delimited to a  <dig>  cm region flanked by indel- <dig> and dgsnp <dig> . the mapping results also confirmed the genotyping accuracy of slaf-seq and the efficiency of marker discovery using whole-genome shotgun strategy.

validation of markers on hindmarsh × w <dig> dh population
to confirm the ari-e position, we conducted linkage analysis with  <dig> dh plants from the hindmarsh × w <dig> cross. five polymorphic markers including m <dig>  indel- <dig>  indel- <dig>  indel- <dig> and indel  <dig> were applied to the segregating population for ari-e mapping. linkage analysis identified the ari-e semi-dwarf gene delimited by two indel markers indel- <dig>  and indel- <dig> , which were physically located in the region of  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,184 bp  on chromosome 5h . the mapping position of ari-e in the hindmarsh × w <dig> dh population was consistent with that in the dash × vb <dig> dh population and the overlapped region identified by the two populations was considered the ari-e candidate region, which allowed further narrowing of the ari-e locus to an  <dig>  mb interval between indel- <dig>  and indel- <dig>  on the barley popseq physical map.

analysis of the candidate region and gene annotation
in this  <dig>  mb region, only five genes were predicted according to the barley popseq physical map, and the gene annotations are presented in table  <dig>  mazzucotelli et al.  <cit>  reported that e <dig> ubiquitin ligases play a major role in protein degradation and are involved in plant growth and development. therefore, mloc_ <dig> caught our attention, based on the gene annotation of barley which acts as the e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase, and seemed most likely to be responsible for the semi-dwarf phenotype. sequence analyses of hindmarsh, however, showed no difference in mloc_ <dig> compared with the reference genome morex. alignment of the nucleotide sequences in the other four genes also revealed no variation between hindmarsh and morex.table  <dig> predicted genes in the candidate region

genetic variants of the target region were also identified and are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  most of the variants were in the intergenic region, with only a few located in upstream and downstream regions of the predicted genes. such variants were at least  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb away from the upstream and downstream regions of the predicted genes, respectively . to test if the variants affect the expression pattern of the predicted genes, we designed five primer pairs  for qrt-pcr analysis in vb <dig>  dash and golden promise. according to the qrt-pcr results, the relative expression levels of mloc_ <dig>  mloc_ <dig> and hvloc <dig> had not significantly changed in the three varieties . however, hvloc <dig> and mloc_ <dig> exhibited higher expression levels in golden promise and lower expression levels in dash compared with the vb <dig> , which indicates that both genes exhibit no consistent expression with ari-e. it seems that none of the five predicted genes was responsible for the ari-e semi-dwarf phenotype based on our genetic map and the recent release of the barley draft genome assembly.

discussion
traditional methods for developing markers are tedious, time-consuming and expensive  <cit> . limited number of markers in the barley genomic region is a major obstacle in the fine-mapping of barley genes, which has encouraged the development of new marker systems that have a greater degree of polymorphism. slaf-seq is a relatively new experimental method which is considered an efficient and high-resolution strategy for large-scale genotyping using an enhanced reduced representation library  sequencing method  <cit> . it is an effective, low-cost technology for constructing high-density linkage maps, which has successfully facilitated the identification of major qtls related to complex traits in plants  <cit> . using the slaf-seq approach, an snp-based saturated genetic map was constructed and a major fruit length qtl, which explained  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in cucumber, was detected  <cit> . combining slaf-seq with bsa identified chromosome regions related to  <dig> grain weight in rice and the gene that control inflorescence meristem function in maize  <cit> . xu et al.  <cit>  reported that fruit flesh thickness in cucumber was fine-mapped by two slaf markers in the  <dig>  mb genomic region. after anchoring the markers to the cucumber  <dig> reference genome,  <dig> genes were predicted, and csa2m <dig>  was identified as a good candidate gene due to its high expression level in thick fruit flesh varieties. in some cases, the interval identified by slaf-seq is too large to isolate the target gene. the mapping region of barley hvsgra  defined by ssr and slaf-seq, was insufficient to pin the candidate gene in barley  <cit> . therefore, new markers based on the barley physical map were designed to further fine-mapping and its candidate gene was isolated according to its annotation and a nonsense mutation. in the present study,  <dig>  slaf tags were developed by high-throughput sequencing, with  <dig>  snps identified . associated analysis with the snp-index obtained semi-dwarf gene ari-e related candidate regions on chromosome 5h with a size of  <dig>  mb . the large candidate region of ari-e by slaf-seq was possibly due to the low recombinants between semi-dwarf and high pools in the target region. after combining with primary mapping, the snp markers converted from polymorphic slafs provide useful data for restricting the candidate-associated regions into  <dig>  cm interval, delimiting an approximate  <dig>  mb region in  <dig> dash × vb <dig> dh lines. therefore, slaf-seq is a highly-efficient strategy for mapping the candidate gene, but further work needs to be done to refine the target interval to isolate the candidate, especially in barley with such a large haploid genome.

indel markers are a gel-based molecular marker which has played a major role in genetic studies and qtl mapping in rice and arabidopsis . the recent release of barley draft assembly sequences provides a new approach to finding insertion/deletion polymorphisms in barley varieties at the dna level. a total of  <dig>  indels were identified between two sequenced barley varieties, morex and barke, based on genome-wide alignment, and  <dig>  indel markers were integrated with the barley consensus map  <cit> . taking the same approach, we developed indel markers in the target region; the newly-designed polymorphic indel markers were linked with ari-e . of these, indel- <dig> marker co-segregated with ari-e and we narrowed the ari-e gene to the region flanked by indel- <dig> and dgsnp <dig> in the dash × vb <dig> dh population . most of the developed markers were co-segregated, possibly due to the small population size. furthermore, we validated the mined markers to another mapping population , and the ari-e gene was flanked by indel- <dig> and indel- <dig> . combining both mapping results, ari-e can be narrowed between indel- <dig> and indel- <dig>  as a result, alignment of the whole-genome shotgun sequence with the released barley genome sequence enabled the discovery of a large number of dna markers. this study is an example of the efficient exploitation of targeted indel markers developed by the whole-genome shotgun strategy in barley. different alleles at the ari-e locus such as such as ari-e. <dig>  ari-e. <dig>  ari-e. <dig> and ari-e. <dig> described by kucera et al.  <cit> , were induced by ionizing radiations  and by chemical mutagens . allelism to the ari-e mutant showed that ari-e. <dig> and golden promise mutant are alleles  <cit> . the variety golden promise  with ari-e is famous for its desirable agronomic traits such as earliness, short stiff straw, reduced awn length and better salt tolerance compared with other semi-dwarf varieties  <cit> . considering its importance to barley breeding, ari-e has been genetically characterized in numerous genetic backgrounds. thomas et al.  <cit>  used the phenotypic markers in both f <dig> populations, and a doubled monoploid population to genetically map the ari-e locus to chromosome 5h of barley near the centromere. in the aflp and ssr marker map constructed for the derkado × b83-12/21/ <dig> dh population, the ari-e gene was flanked by ssr marker bmag <dig>  and bmag <dig>   <cit> . after genotyping with the  <dig> -snp illumina goldengate oligonucleotide pool assay in a three-way barley cross, malosetti et al.  <cit>  identified that ari-e was close to snp marker 2_ <dig> which has been included in the barley integrated map of aghnoum et al.  <cit>  in 5h bin  <dig>  based on illumina’s oligo pool assays  , ari-e is associated with snp markers 1_ <dig> to 2_ <dig> in 5h bins  <dig> to  <dig> in bw <dig>  which resulted from the introgression ari-e into the background of cv. ‘bowman’  <cit> . all these results confirm that barley 5h bin  <dig> encompasses the major semi-dwarf gene ari-e. using gbs data of gpmx rils population, ari-e is closely linked with gbs marker mr_47526p1793r <dig>  which is flanked by mr_335403p1239r <dig> and mr_1560792p1192f <dig>  <cit> . these markers defined a  <dig>  cm interval on the gpmx gbs map. according to the barley ibsc physical map, the interval defined at least 46 mb and contained an estimated  <dig> genes  <cit> . the same interval spanned a total sequence length of approximately 10 mb on the barley popseq map  <cit> . the authors explained that both the relatively low recombination and lack of detected polymorphism resulted in the low-resolution map in the ari-e region of the gpmx rils population. in our initial mapping, ari-e was defined at a  <dig>  cm interval, which corresponds to  <dig>  mb on the barley popseq physical map. although the genetic distance was similar, the physical map interval of ari-e defined by m <dig> and indelhvces <dig> in the dash × vb <dig> dh population was larger than that delimited by mr_335403p1239r <dig> and mr_1560792p1192f <dig> in the gpmx rils population. the target region decreased to  <dig>  cm covering the physical map from  <dig> ,066 bp to  <dig> ,368 bp intervals in the dash × vb <dig> dh population. after we had validated the polymorphic markers to the hindmarsh × w <dig> dh population, ari-e was flanked by indel- <dig> and indel- <dig> and the genomics dna interval of  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,184 bp on chromosome 5h. based on the barley physical map, its physical position and combining the mapping results of both populations, the candidate region of ari-e declined to an interval of  <dig>  mb, which represents significant progress toward identifying the functional gene compared to previous studies  <cit> .

ellis et al.  <cit>  reported that recessive dwarf mutants in barley indicate a loss of function. it was confirmed in both barley recessive semi-dwarf mutants, uzu <dig> and sdw1/denso, which resulted from the loss of function of the br receptor gene hvbri <dig> and gibberellin biosynthesis gene hvga20ox
 <dig>  respectively  <cit> . genetic analysis showed that ari-e mutants also carried a recessive allele  <cit> . we deduced that the semi-dwarfism of ari-e was possibly due to the mutation of one of the functional genes. according to the most current popseq barley map  <cit> , there are five predicted genes in the candidate region . considering the semi-dwarf phenotype of ari-e and the gene annotation of the five genes, mloc_ <dig> predicted as an e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase may be a candidate gene for ari-e. e <dig> ubiquitin ligase members are involved in the regulation of some biological processes including hormonal control of vegetative growth, plant reproduction, light response, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and dna repair  <cit> . for example, both arabidopsis sly <dig> and rice gid <dig> encode the f-box subunit of scf e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that regulates ga responses and results in the dwarf phenotype  <cit> . unfortunately, no nucleotide sequence variants of mloc_ <dig> or the other four genes were present between the ari-e variety hindmarsh and the reference variety morex.

in barley, semi-dwarf gene sdw1/denso affects not only plant height but also multiple agronomic traits, because sdw1/denso encodes ga 20-oxidase and is involved in gibberellin biosynthesis . therefore, sdw1/denso is expressed all of the tissues and affects many developmental processes through ga level  <cit> . ari-e also reduces plant height and is related with lots of agronomic traits, such as erect juvenile growth habit, earliness, compact inflorescene, short awns, small seed size and cell size reduction in leaf blades  <cit> . this indicated that ari-e may be involved in different developmental processes. furthermore, reduced expression of hvga20ox
 <dig> was identified in various organs in denso semi-dwarf mutant compared with tall variety  <cit> . rieu et al.  <cit>  reported that atga20ox
 <dig>  was showed different expression in different tissues, and at different developmental stages. the difference of plant height between ari-e semi-dwarf and tall varieties reaches the maximum at the heading time and the uniform leaf samples can easily be collected. therefore, leaves of vb <dig>  dash and golden promise were collected to detected relative expression levels of all predicted genes at the heading stage. but expression levels of the five genes were not consistent with ari-e. the unexpected results might be due to the limited resolution of the current barley physical map while the non-coding region may play a key role in inducing semi-dwarfness. owing to the large size of the barley genome  and the high repeat content , the current physical map comprises  <dig>  contigs with a cumulative size of  <dig>  gb representing 96 % of the physical length of the barley genome  <cit> . chromosomal assignments between the popseq and ibsc maps agree in  <dig>  % of the cases and discordant contig placements mostly occurred in the genetic centromere due to the severely reduced recombination frequency  <cit> . moreover, most of the map-based cloned barley genes have been located in the distal regions of the chromosome. considering that ari-e occurred near the centromere of barley 5h  <cit> , the repetitive nature of the barley genome  <cit>  and limited resolution of the barley physical map, there may be other unanchored candidate genes for the ari-e semi-dwarf gene.

in summary, next-generation sequencing combined with the current barley physical map served as a hub for marker development in the desired region and the candidate gene will be isolated with the ongoing construction of the high-resolution barley physical map.

CONCLUSIONS
traditional marker assays and salf-seq in conjunction with bsa were conducted to map the semi-dwarf gene ari-e. snps and indel markers were developed by slaf-seq and whole-genome shotgun sequencing technology, respectively, to fine-map ari-e. the ari-e gene was mapped between two developed markers indel- <dig> and indel- <dig> with an interval of  <dig>  mb. the current study exemplifies the use of slaf-seq for snp discovery and whole-genome shotgun sequencing for indel development in the target region, which may pave the way for map-based cloning of the ari-e gene and unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the semi-dwarf phenotype.
