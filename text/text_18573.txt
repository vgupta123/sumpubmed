BACKGROUND
the rat is an important model organism for studying human disease biology  <cit> . in the past century, a great variety of strains and substrains have been bred that differ in susceptibility to complex diseases like hypertension, diabetes, autoimmunity, cancer and addiction disorders. due to practical limitations, studies on disease phenotypes are often conducted in varying substrains by different research groups. for example, shr/ncrl and shr/nhsd are used for studying cardiovascular phenotypes in the united states  <cit>  and europe  <cit> , respectively. the effect on the interpretability and extrapolation of the obtained results by using different substrains remains unclear. several studies based on dna snp marker panels showed that genetic variation between substrains is present  <cit> . however, the magnitude of this difference can only be properly interpreted when assessed on a genome-wide scale as variation is not necessarily randomly distributed throughout the genome. here, we systematically analyzed whole genome sequence  data of  <dig> rat strains and substrains resulting in a comprehensive inventory of strain and substrain-specific variants.

with the emergence of next-generation sequencing  techniques, whole genome sequencing of many rat strains and substrains were performed  <cit> , with the primary goal to provide insight in the genetic factors underlying phenotypic traits in these strains. after the availability of the first rat reference genome assembly in  <dig>  <cit> , the first variation catalog of a non-reference inbred strain, the spontaneously hypertensive rat , was published in  <dig>  <cit> . this data was later combined with the bn-lx genome sequence and extended with rna sequencing data, resulting in a comprehensive catalog of genetic variation and associated quantitative and qualitative transcription phenotypes, in the hxb/bxh recombinant inbred  panel  <cit> . this panel is a valuable tool for dissection of the complex genetic basis of cardiovascular, behavioral, and developmental disorders. in addition, the eight founders of the rat heterogeneous stock  were recently sequenced  <cit> . in this study, the genome sequence of the founder strains were used to impute the genomes of the  <dig> snp-genotyped heterogeneous stock rats that were also extensively phenotyped. this work resulted in the identification of  <dig> high-resolution quantitative trait loci  for  <dig> phenotypes. more rat whole genome sequence data became available by publication of the variation catalog and strain specific sequences of the dark agouti  and fischer  rat, which carry unique dichotomous phenotypes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and several cancer types  <cit> . finally, a large community-driven effort in rat genome sequencing yielded variation catalogs of  <dig> inbred strains and substrains  <cit> . analysis of this data identified strain-specific selective sweeps and gene clusters that implied genes involved in the development of cardiovascular disease in rat.

one important factor that determines the success of cataloging genomic variation is the quality of the used reference genome. since its initial publication in  <dig>  the rat reference genome has undergone major improvements and was recently further improved using a range of ngs-based methods  <cit> . this has resulted in version  <dig>  of the rat reference assembly in  <dig>  <cit> . although the v <dig>  assembly shows great overall improvement at both nucleotide and the structural level, it has not yet been used as a reference for the analysis of the aforementioned rat genomes. instead, these studies all used the v <dig>  assembly, which is publicly available since  <dig>  <cit>  and contains many gaps, assembly inconsistencies and nucleotide and indel errors .

finally, bioinformatic analysis of whole genome sequencing data, including mapping and variant calling, has matured rapidly over the past years. however, as a result of these ongoing developments, a broad range of bioinformatic tools and settings were used for the analysis of currently published rat genomes. direct comparison of different strains therefore becomes challenging, especially because many old tools did not call reference positions. taken together, a comprehensive overview and systematic comparison of laboratory rat genomic variation is currently lacking. such a resource would be useful for a broad range of rat researchers, as it allows proper selection of experimental and control rat strains and interpretation of potential substrain effects in published experiments.

RESULTS
genetic variation among strains
we gathered the genomes of  <dig> rat strains that were sequenced previously  <cit>   and analyzed them together with newly derived sequences from the bn-lx/cubprin, shr/olaipcvprin and shr/ncrlprin rat strains . we aligned reads of all  <dig> strains to the rgsc <dig>  assembly . after applying strict criteria  and using multi-sample variant calling we identified in total  <dig> , <dig> snvs,  <dig> , <dig> indels and  <dig>  structural variants compared to the reference assembly.table  <dig>

sequence information from  <dig> known strains was used. the unknown suo_f <dig> strain was also included in the analysis. in addition le/stm was sequenced with two separate sequencing platforms: illumina and solid; these two datasets were treated as separate samples in the analysis. therefore in total this table contains variant information of  <dig> samples from 40 +  <dig> rat strains.



to assess the sensitivity and specificity of our calls we made use of finished capillary sequencing data from  <dig> bac clones from the le/stm strain, which was also sequenced by two different ngs approaches. we evaluated  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides and found in total  <dig>  snvs that were detected by capillary sequencing and ngs techniques.  <dig> snvs were missed by whole-genome sequencing; resulting in an estimate of  <dig>   missed snvs genome-wide.  <dig> snvs identified by whole-genome sequencing were not found in the bacs; resulting in an estimate of  <dig>   false positive snv calls genome-wide. for indels the false positive and negative call rates are higher  due to known detection difficulties of current calling algorithms. although the  <dig> strains were sequenced on two different ngs platforms , false positive and negative call rates based on the le data  were similar .

small genomic variation: snvs and indels
we identified single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions  with the genome analysis toolkit  haplotypecaller  <cit> . all together we identified  <dig>  m snvs of which  <dig> % were homozygous and  <dig> % were heterozygous. this small percentage of heterozygous variants can be attributed to incomplete fixation of the inbred strain, genomic duplications followed by diversification, and technical errors in the sequencing or data analysis. these variants were filtered out in a separate file  and were not taken into account in further downstream analyses.

to understand the functional consequences of the snvs we annotated these variants using snpeff   <cit> . predictions on the functional consequences of a variant are typically overestimated due to for instance their presence in pseudogenes or non-constitutive exons  <cit> . here we set out to systematically interrogate the extent of this overestimation by a detailed dissection of  <dig> snvs which are annotated to have a deleterious effect  on gene function including stop-gain mutations and alterations of splice sites . first we tested the hypothesis that neighboring variants could possibly restore the open reading frame by investigating the high impact snv vicinity. we found for  <dig> snvs  a neighboring snv or indel that restored the open reading frame . from the remaining  <dig> high impact snvs we determined the expression in twelve bn-lx/cub tissues for the genes in which the variants are located . we then compared this to the expression of all genes and found that the highly impacted genes are expressed at significantly lower levels . in addition, for the expressed genes, we analyzed the usage of individual exons by means of the ‘percentage spliced in’  index per exon. interestingly, we found that the exons containing high impact snvs tend to be less used and more often spliced out than expected . thus, we conclude that most high impact snvs will actually only have a limited biological relevance, in part by neutralization by neighboring variants or by being ‘repressed’ in expression at the gene and exon levels.table  <dig> prediction of the functional consequences of the snvs

cross-species comparison of genome variation
to get an impression of the nucleotide diversity among laboratory rat strains in relation to other domesticated animals, we compared the snv density between five different domesticated species. we extracted all autosomal genomic regions that are one-to-one comparable  with the rat genome from dog, horse, pig and mouse. next, we determined the amount of species-specific snvs in each  <dig> kilobase syntenic window to identify regions that contain high and low nucleotide diversity in each species. we extracted the regions with highest and lowest amount of snvs that are shared among all five species. in total, the cumulative regions with a low snv density contain  <dig> genes at  <dig> genomic loci . when we functionally annotate these genes using the panther classification system  <cit> , we find enrichment  for genes involved in catabolic processes . this might reflect the evolutionary constraint on diet, exerted in these five species by domestication  <cit> . for the regions that exhibit high snv density in all five species we in total find  <dig> genes at  <dig> genomic loci . functional annotation with panther shows an enrichment  for olfactory and hemoglobin genes, which are known to rapidly evolve and are highly variable in several species  <cit> .figure  <dig> cross-species comparison of snv densities.  an example of a locus  on mouse chromosome  <dig> with the lowest snv density in five domesticated species.  an example of a locus  on mouse chromosome  <dig> with the highest snv density in five domesticated species.



another way to look at loci under selective pressure is by studying the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate per gene . genes that are potentially under positive selection have a non-synonymous to synonymous ratio of > <dig>   <cit> . we identified all protein coding genes  that contain  <dig> or more snvs in the protein-coding region  and extracted the genes that have a non-synonymous to synonymous ratio of > <dig>  . panther functional annotation of these  <dig> genes using the  <dig>  genes as background shows that this set is enriched for genes related to the immune and olfactory system . this data confirms the results of the interspecies snv density analysis and shows that within rat strains these types of genes are indeed highly polymorphic  <cit> .

‘population’ structure
to get an impression of the ‘population’ structure of these  <dig> strains, we used the snv genotype information per locus in a bayesian approach to define clusters without any other prior knowledge. in addition, to demonstrate the power of this approach to accurately define clusters, we included genotypes from wgs data from a strain of unknown origin . we hypothesized that we would be able to designate the strain of origin based on the genotypes of a broad representation of rat strains in this data set. we performed this analysis using faststructure, which is an algorithm for inferring population structure from large snp genotype data  <cit> . faststructure identifies the number of populations  needed to explain the structure in the data in which individual samples can have membership in multiple clusters. when we analyze the genotypes of all 40 +  <dig> rat strains we find that we can differentiate nine distinct clusters . five strains have membership in multiple clusters, which may reflect shared ancestry or interbreeding before or during inbred strain derivation, whereas the other strains only consist of one cluster. in general most clusters resemble the previously published classification based on a rooted phylogenetic tree  <cit> . in addition this method allows identification of similarity between clusters that have been separated in a phylogenetic tree analysis. for example, the gk/ox strain, which is a wistar derived strain originating from japan, also shows contribution of the cluster which contains the wistar derived strains from europe and the united states  <cit> . we also find that the included suo strain clearly shows a full match in the fischer  cluster and we therefore conclude that the suo is a substrain of the f <dig> strain . besides the ancestral clustering of strains, we also studied the subchromosomal pattern of similarity and divergence. we determined for each bin of  <dig>  snvs to which cluster it was most similar . based on this analysis we observed that the overall clustering based on the genomes as a whole, matches the clusters found in the genomic cluster distribution using the 40 +  <dig> strains and is concordant with previous work  <cit> . we find that substrains  have a comparable genomic cluster structure, indicating recent divergence. of note, the relatively large window size of  <dig>  snvs may cause overrepresentation of differential loci between substrains that are known to be very similar . nevertheless, we find five rat strains that showed contribution from multiple clusters in the faststructure analysis  of which one  shows a genomic distribution of the clusters # <dig>  and # <dig> , which is in line with its known breeding origin  <cit> . in addition, cluster  <dig>  shows a confetti-like signature, while the faststructure analysis does not categorize them as multi-cluster strains. in conclusion, we see shared haplotypes between strains in different clusters, indicating common ancestry and/or cross-breeding during inbred strain derivation. nevertheless, the variation uniqueness per cluster is very high.figure  <dig> ‘population’ structure of 40 +  <dig> rat strains.  per strain, the contribution from the  <dig> different clusters is plotted as percentage of the genome. each cluster is represented by a separate color. the cluster designated with a ‘m’ represents the strains that have membership from multiple clusters.  per strain, the genomic distribution along rat chromosome  <dig> is plotted as an example. the colors match the cluster colors from .



large genomic variation: structural variants
structural variants were determined using two independent methods. i) we interrogated the orientation of the mapped read-pairs  compared to the reference genome to detect deletions, tandem duplications and inversions by applying the delly  <cit>  algorithm in all samples simultaneously. ii) cnvnator  <cit>  was used to identify relative changes in read-depth  thereby detecting losses and gains of genomic segements. given the algorithmic difficulties in detecting structural variants we took a strict cutoff to minimize false positive calls . in total, we identified  <dig>  deletions,  <dig> tandem duplications and  <dig>  inversions based on the read-pair method together with  <dig>  copy number variable sites based on the read-depth method. all together this resulted in  <dig>  svs in the  <dig> strains.

substrain variability
to identify the genomic variants that differ between substrains we used the seven strains of which data for at least two substrains was available: aci, bn, f <dig>  lew, shr, ss and wky . we did not include wky/gla because this substrain is known to have diverged significantly from the other wky substrains  <cit>  which is also evident from our genomic comparisons. for each of the seven groups we identified all positions that were variable between the substrains. we found that the degree of substrain variation was highly variable between strains  , which may reflect the time after separation of the substrain colonies. for comparative functional analyses of substrain variation  we used all other snvs , excluding variants that were shared by all  <dig> strains, as a comparison group.table  <dig> strains and substrains included in the substrain variability analysis

to get an impression of the genomic distribution of the substrain snvs we plotted the genomic distance between two consecutive substrain snvs . for two groups  we found an even distribution of the snvs through the genome, while in the other five groups we also observe clustering of snvs. this effect is limited to a few loci for bn, but is more widespread for wky. one explanation for the clustering of these snvs can be introgression from a rat strain that is not included in the current analysis. for instance we observe a cluster of snvs in the bn group on chromosome  <dig>  for the bn-lx substrains that are in this group, this region is known to contain the lx locus from the polydactylous pd/cub strain  <cit> . since whole genome sequencing data of the pd/cub strain is not available we observe the congenic lx segment as an introgressed cluster of substrain-specific snvs in our analysis. although this analysis is able to identify introgressed loci from other sequenced strains, we cannot exclude that we miss introgression from closely related strains with limited snv diversity.figure  <dig> genomic distribution of substrain variants per strain. for each strain the distance between two consecutive snvs  is plotted along the genomic position . the windows on the x-axis represent the different chromosomes. loci with a high density of substrain snvs can be observed as clusters that drop down from the average genome-wide pattern.



besides introgression, the occurrence of de novo mutations  appears the main driver of substrain variation  <cit> . to understand the process of newly arising variants we analyzed the different types of nucleotide changes that occurred. the control set of  <dig> , <dig> snvs was used to estimate the expected amount of substitutions per category. the observed amount of nucleotide changes of the  <dig>  substrain snvs was then compared to this expected pattern. we find an enrichment of c to t substitutions in general, which is most pronounced at cpg dinucleotides . this may reflect an elevated rate of spontaneous/oxidative deamination of 5-methyl-cytosines, which is associated with oxidative dna damage in animal genomes  <cit> . in addition, we find a significant  depletion of t to c changes , which are typically the result of alkylating mechanisms  <cit> .figure  <dig> substrain variant characteristics.  bar plots showing the contribution of each nucleotide change for all substrain variants  versus the control variants . error bars represent the 95% confidence interval.  bar plot showing the ka/ks ratio ratio of the substrain variants versus the control variants.  bar plot showing the average phastcons score for each substrain variant compared to the control variants. substrain variants affect nucleotides with a significantly higher phastcons score . error bars represent the sem.



in summary, we find supportive evidence that suggests the occurrence of substrain variants by endogenous reactive oxygen species ; a common source of oxidative dna damage  <cit> . based on the mutational spectrum, non-negative matrix factorization  can be used to identify more detailed underlying mutational signatures. however, when we carry out such analyses we do not find a significant difference in mutational signature between substrain and control snvs, suggesting that substrain variation results from common mutational processes and thus represents ongoing evolutionary processes.

next, we investigated the functional consequences of the  <dig>  substrain variants by analyzing the nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio, which we previously used as a measure of selective pressure. interestingly, we find relatively more nonsynonymous snvs in the substrain variants compared to the control set, indicating that the substrain snvs more often affect protein sequence . to substantiate this finding and to get a gene annotation-independent measure of the functional impact of the substrain variants, we also retrieved the phastcons scores  <cit>  per variant. this score  is calculated for each nucleotide in the genome as a measure for evolutionarily constraint and was derived by comparing the rat genome to  <dig> other species: mouse, dog, cow, opossum, chicken, frog, zebrafish and human. in line with the previous results we find a significantly higher phastcons score of the substrain-affected nucleotides compared to the control set . these two lines of evidence suggest that evolutionary pressure has not  selected against these possibly damaging variants, confirming the relatively young age of the substrain variants. on the other hand, substrain-specific variants may have a relatively large effect on protein function and thus on associated biology and it is therefore extremely important to know this category of variation when comparing experimental results obtained with different rat substrains in different labs.

discussion
although rgsc <dig>  was already released in  <dig>  all whole-genome sequencing studies to date are based on the much older rgsc <dig>  assembly. here, we merge publicly available whole genome sequence data of  <dig> widely used rat inbred strains and substrains into a comprehensive integrated variant inventory. this resource allows researchers to functionally annotate their data on the more recent rgsc <dig> .

integrated analysis of a large number of strains increases effective genomic coverage and thus improves on variant calling sensitivity. the multi-sample variant calling approach used here, makes optimally use of this  <cit> , resulting in a more accurate and more complete set of called variants, especially in strains with lower coverage at a given position. the resulting resource is useful for a broad range of researchers who use rats for studying genetic traits and can easily be exploited. for example, this inventory can be used for choosing strains and substrains for specific experiment or as controls, when knowing their genetic differences in a locus of interest. another way to use this resource is by coupling it to quantitative trait locus  data, which is available for many of these strains for a broad range of complex traits  <cit> . this allows for filtering for shared and unique variants between strains with and without the trait to narrow in on potential causal variants. finally, the resource can be used for strain of origin designation when wgs or genotyping data is available, as exemplified by the suo_f <dig> wgs data included in this study.

we showed that the biological relevance of most snvs that are annotated to have a deleterious effect is limited. in part, this effect can be attributed to the low expression level of the gene or to skipping of exons in which a high impact variant is found. furthermore, a small part of the automatically predicted deleterious variants appeared false positives caused by the lack of taking neighboring variants into account in the effect prediction. addressing this effect requires adaptions of the current effect prediction calling algorithms.

when we investigate the population structure of the  <dig> rat strains, we find a distinction between nine separated clusters, which recapitulates the previously published origin of some of these strains  <cit> . we see that the genomic variant distribution in more than 65% of the strains  has a clearly distinct pattern between clusters. in addition, all strains in cluster  <dig> show a confetti-like genomic distribution of multiple clusters, possibly reflecting their heterogeneous, yet shared, origin. similar to data from mice  <cit>  we observe introgression of shared haplotypes between strains, suggesting intercrosses in rat strain selection processes. using snp marker information in rat, it was already shown that this effect was present  <cit>  and here we confirm this observation on a genome-wide scale.

furthermore, we identified substrain variation in seven rat strains and find that the degree of variation is highly variable between strains. the strain with the highest degree of substrain variation is wky and part of this variation can be explained by their distribution to different geographical locations before complete inbreeding  <cit> . when we further investigate the different aspects of substrain variants we can explain part of their origin by introgression and part by ongoing evolution through genetic drift. in general the characteristics of substrain variants matches with their recent origin. firstly the impact of the substrain variants is relatively high: substrain variants more often affect protein sequence and nucleotides with high phascons score. secondly the substrain variants may show suggestive evidence for endogenous ros dna damage, a process that continuously challenges the integrity of dna  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we present a comprehensive inventory of uniformly called genomic variants mapped on the rgsc <dig>  reference assembly for a range of commonly used inbred rat strains. this resource is valuable for a broad range of researchers that use rats in biomedical and complex genetics research and may facilitate further research on rat functional genomics and interspecies comparison. the knowledge on substrain variation may assist experimental design and improve on the outcome and reproducibility of experimental results between institutes and thus improve the overall quality of biomedical animal research.

all data described in this study is publicly available in the variant call format  and accessible via the rat genome database  for browsing or direct ftp downloading  <cit> . in addition data from the four newly sequenced strains is also available via phenogen informatics   <cit> .
