BACKGROUND
the hindbrain is the most posterior vesicle of the embryonic brain. during early steps of neural development, the hindbrain is transiently organized in segments along the anterior-posterior  axis, which are called rhombomeres . this transient segmental organization is necessary for the correct specification of the different neuronal subtypes, the location of the cranial nerve exit points, and the migration streams of the neural crest cells from the dorsal hindbrain towards the branchial arches. rhombomeres display a specific combinatory of gene expression that confers molecular identity to the rhombomeric territories, and they are compartment-like units with cell lineage restriction .

refinement of the ap identities within the hindbrain requires the establishment of local signaling centers, which emit signals that pattern territories in their vicinity. two signaling centers which emit fgf and wnt signals are located within the hindbrain: the isthmic organizer , at the level of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary  , and the 'r4-fgf source'  <cit> . fgfs emitted from the central and caudal hindbrain have been demonstrated to be crucial for hindbrain specification. in zebrafish, fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> from r <dig> have redundant functions in patterning the hindbrain  <cit> , whereas in chick and mouse fgf <dig> dynamically expressed in the r4-r <dig> region is needed for the specification of the caudal hindbrain  <cit> . gain-of-function experiments in zebrafish suggested that fgfs from the hindbrain cooperate with the transcription factor vhnf <dig> in the specification of the caudal hindbrain  <cit> . this cooperation occurs early during neurulation and leads to the induction of two genes involved in rhombomeric specification, krox <dig> for r <dig> and mafb for r <dig> and r <dig>  results in chick suggest that vhnf <dig> operates upstream of fgf signaling in this regulation: vhnf <dig> not only cooperates with fgf <dig> in the induction of krox <dig> and mafb , but also regulates fgf <dig> expression  <cit> . analyses of the krox <dig> and mafb regulatory regions in mice have shown that they contain functional vhnf1-binding sites, suggesting that vhnf <dig> can control these genes in a direct manner as well  <cit> .

one of the questions that have challenged developmental biologists in the last years is how fgf signaling can generate such a different array of responses in the several developmental events in which is involved. it is known that these very diverse outcomes are context dependent, with fgf signaling acting in a cellular environment defined by previous and current signaling activities  <cit> . one of the most accepted hypotheses considers that the activation and tuning of different intracellular pathways downstream fgf signaling can generate part of this variability. among those, the fgf-downstream intracellular cascades ras-erk1/ <dig> and pi3k-akt are those that have mostly been related to embryonic patterning events. different and in some cases contradictory models have been proposed for the involvement of ras-erk1/ <dig> and pi3k-akt pathways in different tissues and systems  <cit> . in addition, the fgf signaling system is tightly regulated by a series of modulators, which exert their functions at different levels of the pathway, from the fgfr to specific components of the different intracellular pathways . the expression of these genes is induced by fgf activity itself and regional and temporal variation in their levels of expression is though to tune fgf signaling to the appropriate levels for each particular event. the term 'synexpression group' has been adopted to designate sets of genes that share complex spatio-temporal expression patterns and have a functional relationship  <cit> . synexpression groups form expression cassettes that can be found at different times and locations during development. the fgf factors, such as fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  and fgfrs , together with negative modulators of fgf signaling , the positive modulator flrt <dig> and transcription factors such as the members of the ets-type family pea <dig>  erm and er <dig> have been designated as the 'fgf synexpression group'  <cit> . the aim of the present work was to dissect the fgf-intracellular cascade involved in caudal hindbrain patterning. further to our previous observations on the regulation of fgf <dig> in the chick hindbrain, we provide evidence suggesting that fgf <dig> is a direct transcriptional target of vhnf <dig>  we provide a detailed spatial and temporal map of expression of key components of the fgf signaling system such as mkp <dig>  pea <dig> and of ras-erk1/ <dig> and pi3k-akt activity in the hindbrain at early stages of embryonic development. we also analyze the functional activity of the intracellular pathways downstream fgf signaling using specific chemical inhibitors. the results show that mkp <dig> expression colocalizes with activated erk1/ <dig> and it is sensitive to inhibition of ras-erk1/ <dig>  this pathway mediates the functions of fgf <dig> signaling in caudal hindbrain specification regulating the expression of krox <dig> and mafb , without involvement of the pi3k-akt pathway. altogether these data provide new insights in the repertoire of fgf pathway genes associated to hindbrain development and on the role of fgf signaling in caudal hindbrain specification.

RESULTS
fgf <dig> is rapidly induced after vhnf <dig> overexpression
previous work indicated that fgf <dig> was downstream of vhnf <dig> in the induction of caudal rhombomeric markers such as krox <dig> and mafb . vhnf <dig> operates in a specific time-window and is not able to induce fgf <dig>  mafb or krox <dig> at late stages of hindbrain patterning  <cit> . one important question was to know whether fgf <dig> was a direct downstream target of vhnf <dig>  to address this issue we studied the time course of fgf <dig> induction after mvhnf <dig> overexpression. we designed a semiquantitative rt-pcr approach to determine the kinetics of fgf <dig> induction. embryos of 3-4ss  were electroporated with mvhnf <dig> and incubated at 38°c during different time periods . after incubation, the hindbrain tissue was isolated and processed for rt-pcr amplification.  <dig> min after electroporation, a band of  <dig> bp corresponding to mvhnf <dig> expression at both  <dig> and  <dig> cycles was amplified , indicating the amount of ectopic mvhnf <dig> already transcribed in the embryo. the number of cycles used,  <dig> and  <dig>  was to show that we were not under saturation conditions. at the same time point, a weaker  <dig> bp band corresponding to the endogenous cfgf <dig> expression was amplified by rt-pcr . to avoid biased results and to be able to compare between different time points, the ratio of intensity cfgf3/mvhnf <dig> was always used to analyze the data. as incubation time increased , the intensity of the cfgf <dig> band was progressively stronger in respect to the mvhnf <dig> band . from  <dig> h onwards, the intensity of the cfgf <dig> band was relatively similar for all time points, suggesting that either the reaction reached saturation or vhnf <dig> was not able to induce cfgf <dig> transcription anymore . thus, as early as  <dig> min after electroporation the endogenous expression of fgf <dig> was increased and by  <dig> h a plateau was reached . control experiments were performed with a form of vhnf <dig> containing the q136e substitution in the pou-specific domain that completely abolishes dna-binding  <cit> . the construct was overexpressed and embryos were incubated at 38°c during  <dig> h . the cfgf <dig> relative levels of expression were much higher in experimental samples than in the control .

these results suggest that vhnf <dig> positively regulates fgf <dig> in the chick hindbrain. the rt-pcr semiquantitative analysis shows that fgf <dig> is rapidly induced after vhnf <dig> overexpression, suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation. although regulatory analysis of the mouse fgf <dig> gene revealed a dna region driving fgf <dig> expression to the hindbrain, this enhancer region does not fully recapitulate the dynamics of fgf <dig> expression within the hindbrain and it did not bring much light into the transcription factor binding candidates  <cit> .

akt and erk1/ <dig> pathways are active in the caudal hindbrain
the fgf signals exert their function by activating different intracellular pathways. although five intracellular pathways are known to be downstream of fgf signaling, mainly ras-erk1/ <dig> and, to a lesser extent, pi3k-akt have been related to embryonic processes in different tissues and models  <cit> . given that fgf signaling controls krox <dig> and mafb expression  <cit> , our next question was to study which of these intracellular networks were activated downstream fgf <dig> in the caudal hindbrain.

for this purpose, the activated forms of fgf effectors within the hindbrain at early stages of embryonic development were analyzed. caudal hindbrain tissue from hh8-hh <dig> stage embryos was isolated and western blot analysis was performed to detect the akt and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylated forms . when antibodies against both the total and the phosphorylated forms of akt were used in protein extracts of isolated hindbrains, a  <dig> kd band corresponding to akt was obtained in both cases . this result suggests that the pi3k-akt pathway is active at these stages of hindbrain patterning. western blot analysis detecting either the total or the phosphorylated forms of erk1/ <dig> revealed that ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway was also active during this period . as positive controls for erk1/ <dig> and akt activation, protein extracts of whole embryos were used .

next, we wanted to analyze the spatial distribution of the fgf activities. with this in mind, we performed whole-mount immunodetection of perk1/ <dig> with embryos at hh8-hh <dig> stages. as shown in fig. 2b-h, perk1/ <dig> was detected in embryonic territories within or close to fgf reported sources such as: the anterior neural ridge , the mid-hindbrain boundary , the precardiac mesoderm , the primitive strike , the caudal neural plate, and the presomitic and intermediate mesoderm . between hh <dig> and hh <dig> fgf <dig> is expressed in a domain corresponding to r <dig> and r <dig> . coincident with this expression domain, the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway was also active in the hindbrain at 4ss  . by hh <dig> perk1/ <dig> persisted in the caudal hindbrain and it was extended to the rostral hindbrain, the mhb and the caudal midbrain . flat-mounted hindbrains in fig. 2e showed that perk1/ <dig> was excluded from the ventral part of the tube, with the exception of the caudal hindbrain, where it was localized all along the dorsoventral axis. at hh <dig>  ras-erk1/ <dig> activity was still maintained in the hindbrain . the strongest activity was localized in the mhb . unfortunately, it was not possible to analyze the pakt spatial distribution since available antibodies did not work in whole-mount immunostainings.

expression of the readouts of fgf activity in the caudal hindbrain
to further investigate the fgf signaling system during hindbrain patterning, we checked for the expression of genes of the synexpression group that could act as readouts of fgf activity, to study whether they recapitulate the fgf <dig> expression profile and, therefore, can be used as local readouts of the fgf <dig> activity in the caudal hindbrain.

fgf <dig> is the most strongly expressed fgf during hindbrain patterning displaying a dynamic pattern of expression  <cit> . at 2ss , fgf <dig> transcripts were already present in the prospective hindbrain . at hh <dig> and hh <dig> fgf <dig> expression was maintained in the caudal hindbrain occupying a domain corresponding to the presumptive r4-r <dig> territory . transverse sections show that at this stage, fgf <dig> expression was restricted to the ventral part of the hindbrain , with the exception of the floor plate, and to the hindbrain-underlying mesoderm . at hh <dig> fgf <dig> was still expressed in r <dig> and r <dig>  and in the endoderm that gives rise to the pharyngeal pouches .

mkp <dig>  is a phosphatase belonging to the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway that is commonly regulated by fgf signaling  <cit> . mkp <dig> works as negative modulator of the mapk pathway by specifically dephosphorylating erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . at 2ss , mkp <dig> was faintly detected in the prospective hindbrain . at hh <dig> and hh <dig>  it was apparent in the anr and maintained in the caudal hindbrain . the mkp <dig> expression domain was broader than the fgf3-expressing area . mkp <dig> transcripts were detected in the presumptive mhb territory at hh <dig> , where fgf <dig> is expressed  <cit> . transverse sections confirmed that mkp <dig> was indeed expressed in the neural plate , and in the mesoderm underlying the hindbrain , where fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> are known to be expressed . mkp <dig> expression was maintained in the hindbrain up to r3/r <dig> . mkp <dig> was expressed along the dv axis of the neural tube , and it was downregulated in the underlying mesoderm by hh <dig> . the ectoderm corresponding to the otic placode was also positive for mkp <dig> expression .

pea <dig> is a transcription factor belonging to the pea <dig> subfamily of the ets transcription factors. it is a common mediator of the fgf activity into the nucleus and its expression is also regulated by fgf signaling  <cit> . pea <dig> was weakly detected in the prospective hindbrain by 2ss  . at hh <dig> and hh <dig>  pea <dig> expression increased in the caudal hindbrain . although at hh7+ pea <dig> was very faintly expressed in the neural plate and strongly in the mesoderm , by hh <dig> pea <dig> expression was mainly confined to the hindbrain and the midbrain , with no expression in the underlying mesoderm . note that contrary to mkp <dig>  pea <dig> was not expressed in the otic ectoderm .

sprouty <dig> , as mkp <dig>  is a negative modulator of the mapk pathway regulated by fgf signaling. it is known to be expressed by hh <dig> in the mhb and r <dig>  <cit> . when the expression of sprouty <dig> was analyzed within the hindbrain, two patches of sprouty <dig> expression were observed. the most anterior one corresponded to the mhb and rostral hindbrain, whilst the most posterior patch, that was very faint, was in a domain of the hindbrain not fully coincident with perk1/ <dig> activation or fgf <dig> expression .

these results indicate that genes of the fgf synexpression group are expressed in the caudal hindbrain. at early stages of hindbrain patterning, hh7-hh <dig>  mkp <dig> and pea <dig> coincided with fgf <dig> expression in the hindbrain. by hh <dig>  mkp <dig> was still maintained in the hindbrain in an area coincident with fgf <dig> expression; on the other hand, pea <dig> was expanded in the hindbrain and in the midbrain. spry <dig> expression in the caudal hindbrain was very transient and not fully coincident with the fgf <dig> 

mkp <dig> is a readout of fgf <dig> and vhnf <dig> functions in the hindbrain
we have shown that at hh7-hh <dig> stages mkp <dig> and pea <dig> expression in the caudal hindbrain coincided with fgf <dig> expression and erk1/ <dig> activation. in order to confirm that these genes are indeed dependent on fgf signals within the hindbrain we analyzed their expression after blocking fgf signaling. as expected, when fgf signaling was blocked in hh <dig> embryos by incubation with medium containing  <dig> μm su <dig> during  <dig> h, both mkp <dig> and pea <dig> expression were completely abolished . this is in agreement with several studies that show that expression of both mkp <dig> and pea <dig> is fgf-dependent  <cit> .

most of the reports suggested mkp <dig> as a readout of fgf <dig> activity. since fgf <dig> is not expressed in the caudal hindbrain at this stage, we wanted to address whether fgf <dig> was sufficient to mediate mkp <dig> induction. for this purpose, we overexpressed mfgf <dig> in the neural tube of hh8- <dig> embryos and analyzed cmkp <dig> expression. as early as  <dig> h after electroporation the expression domain of mkp <dig> in the hindbrain was expanded  and by  <dig> h after mfgf <dig> electroporation, mkp <dig> was ectopically expressed in the entire hindbrain . in addition, mvhnf <dig> overexpression was also able to induce mkp <dig> expression, although this effect was detected later, only  <dig> h after electroporation .

in summary, the expression of mkp <dig> and pea <dig> in the hindbrain relays on fgf signaling, and fgf <dig> is able to ectopically induce mkp <dig> in the neural tube as soon as  <dig> h after overexpression. vhnf <dig> also induces mkp <dig> but delayed with respect to fgf <dig>  this observation, together with previous data that showed that vhnf <dig> activates fgf <dig> , suggests that mkp <dig> is induced by vhnf <dig> through fgf <dig> and confirms that vhnf <dig> is upstream of fgf signaling.

fgf activity in the hindbrain is mediated by the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway
next step was to dissect the fgf intracellular pathways involved in hindbrain patterning. different models are proposed for the involvement of ras-erk1/ <dig> and pi3k-akt pathways in patterning events. most of them involve uniquely the erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . pi3k-akt is usually proposed to crosstalk with ras-erk1/ <dig> in either synergistic  <cit>  or antagonistic manners  <cit> . to understand the role of these pathways in the caudal hindbrain we used a functional approach. erk1/ <dig> activity was blocked with the chemical inhibitor pd <dig> and pi3k function with ly <dig>  <cit> . for general blockade of fgf signaling, su <dig> was used  <cit> .

we analyzed how inhibition of erk1/ <dig> and pi3k pathways affected the hindbrain expression of mkp <dig>  the readout of fgf activity. formate beads were soaked in the specific inhibitors or in dmso and then placed within the caudal hindbrain of hh7+-hh <dig> explanted embryos. explants were incubated during  <dig> h at 38°c and then analyzed for mkp <dig> expression . when pd <dig> coated beads were placed near the caudal hindbrain or the presumptive isthmus/mhb of hh <dig> embryos, mkp <dig> expression was completely abolished in these territories . conversely, mkp <dig> expression was unaffected when ly <dig>  or dmso  coated beads were implanted. these results suggest that in the caudal hindbrain, as in the early mhb, mkp <dig> is regulated by ras-erk1/ <dig> but not by the pi3k-akt pathway. mkp <dig> plays a crucial role in controlling ras-erk1/ <dig> cascade by specifically dephosphorylating erk1/ <dig>  our results support the view that in the hindbrain mkp <dig> mediates a negative feedback in the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> .

to confirm the non-regulation of mkp <dig> by the akt pathway in the hindbrain, we further validated the specificity and the efficiency of the pathway-specific inhibitors pd <dig> and ly <dig>  for this purpose, we assayed their function in jurkat t cells sensitive to be activated by both pathways  <cit> . jurkat cells were treated and processed for protein extraction and western blot analysis was performed to reveal total and phosphorylated forms of akt and erk1/ <dig>  as expected, cells that were treated with pd <dig> gave negative signal for perk1/ <dig> but not for pakt. conversely, cells that were treated with ly <dig> did not phosphorylate akt but did erk1/ <dig> . in all cases, total forms of erk1/ <dig> and akt were detected . however, when jurkat t cells were treated with su <dig>  perk1/ <dig> was downregulated but pakt levels were maintained . this is explained by the fact that jurkat cells are pten mutants: pten is inactivated and as consequence, pi3k action in the activation of akt is reinforced  <cit> . this can be reverted by the application of ly <dig> which directly inhibits pi3k, but not by su <dig> which is more upstream in the pathway, just at the level of the rtks .

next, we tested the inhibitors in embryonic explants. hh7+-hh <dig> embryos were explanted and incubated during  <dig> h at 38°c in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. they were processed for protein extraction and western blotted for phosphorylated and total forms of akt and erk1/ <dig>  treatment with  <dig> μm pd <dig> was able to specifically abolish erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, while  <dig> μm ly <dig> treatment abolished akt phosphorylation . when explanted embryos were treated with su <dig>  pakt was downregulated but levels of perk1/ <dig> were maintained. this perk1/ <dig> maintenance was previously reported and attributed to a fgf-independent wounding response induced when the embryo is detached from the vitelline membrane during explantation  <cit> . these observations demonstrate that in the hindbrain the expression of the mkp <dig> is dependent on the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway, but independent of the pi3k-akt activity.

finally, our goal was to know which intracellular fgf-pathway was controlling hindbrain caudal identity. loss-of-function experiments showed that mafb expression was inhibited when the erk1/ <dig> pathway was blocked with pd <dig> . neither dmso  nor ly <dig>  had this effect. similarly, beads coated with pd <dig> suppressed krox <dig> expression in r <dig> , while expression remained unaffected after treating with dmso  or ly <dig> . these results indicate that fgf signaling mediates mafb and krox <dig> expression through the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway with no involvement of the pi3k-akt pathway. as previously shown with su <dig> in solution  <cit> , beads coated with su <dig> abolished mafb  and krox <dig>  in the hindbrain region that was posed in the vicinity to the bead implantation. importantly, these effects were only observed when embryos were treated with su <dig> before the onset of these genes, 5ss for mafb and 6ss for krox <dig> in r <dig>  disruption of fgf signaling had no effect on mafb or krox <dig> expression after this time window , although it still inhibited mkp <dig> expression . these results suggest that fgf signaling is involved in the induction of mafb and krox <dig> in the caudal hindbrain, but not in their maintenance. as expected from our previous results showing that fgf <dig> is not dependent on fgf signaling  <cit> , neither su <dig>  nor pd <dig>  were able to inhibit fgf <dig> expression within the hindbrain at these early stages.

discussion
previous results showed that ectopic vhnf <dig> induces expansion of the fgf <dig> expression domain within the hindbrain, and activates krox <dig> and mafb expression  <cit> . the current work demonstrates that upregulation of fgf <dig> upon vhnf <dig> overexpression is a rapid event suggesting that vhnf <dig> directly induces fgf <dig> transcription. we also analyzed the expression profile of the readouts of fgf activity in the caudal hindbrain and show that they are induced by vhnf <dig> overexpression, confirming the role of vhnf <dig> upstream fgf signaling. in addition, we have demonstrated that fgf signaling in the hindbrain operates through the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway activating krox <dig> and mafb , and fgf <dig> is the triggering factor.

regulation of fgf <dig> expression within the hindbrain
we have demonstrated that fgf <dig> is rapidly induced upon vhnf <dig> overexpression in the hindbrain. these results led us to propose that fgf <dig> induction is directly regulated by vhnf <dig> in the caudal hindbrain. however, several other players may be involved in regulating the expression of fgf <dig>  this can be inferred from the complex and dynamic expression profile that this gene displays within the hindbrain. indeed, we previously demonstrated that vhnf <dig> can only induce fgf <dig> in a discrete period of time that comprises the earliest steps of neurulation, from 0-1ss to 7ss  <cit> . how fgf <dig> expression is later controlled remains largely unknown. mutant mice for kreisler and hoxa <dig> exhibit reduction in the levels of fgf <dig> expression in r <dig> and r <dig>  relating these genes to the regulation of fgf <dig>  <cit> . in addition to this, a recent report proposes that fgf <dig> expression in the chick hindbrain requires inhibition of bmp signaling by follistatin and active fgf signaling  <cit> . however, in our hands, neither electroporation of mfgf <dig> nor loss-of-function of fgf by chemical inhibitors was able to induce or abolish cfgf <dig> at short periods. most probably, this discrepancy is due to differences in the length of treatment and the embryonic stage of the specimens.

the fact that the fgf <dig> expression profile within the hindbrain is not exactly coincident in the different vertebrate species  <cit>  suggests that its regulation presents substantial species-specific differences. interestingly, whereas we have demonstrated that in chick vhnf <dig> overexpression rapidly induces cfgf <dig>  the vhnf <dig> hypomorphic mutant in zebrafish shows caudal expansion of fgf <dig>  <cit> . detailed characterization of the fgf <dig> regulatory regions in different species would help to clarify this issue. to the date, trials in this direction have failed to clearly localize the regulatory region/s responsible for fgf <dig> expression in the hindbrain  <cit> . we have scanned the annotated chick fgf <dig> locus to identify potential vhnf1-binding sites in the fgf <dig> regulatory regions, but dna sequence analysis did not led us to identify any regulatory region of relevance. blast analysis similarly failed to find conserved sequence elements present amongst disparate genomes in the databases. therefore, identifying the potential vhnf1-binding sites in this region represents a major goal in understanding the molecular mechanisms required for fgf <dig> expression in the hindbrain.

a local gradient of erk1/ <dig> activity coincides with early expression of fgf <dig> and fgf activity readouts in the caudal hindbrain
we studied fgf signaling during hindbrain patterning by analyzing the profile of the fgf-activated ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway. we show that the activated form of erk1/ <dig>  perk1/ <dig>  is localized at early stages of development in embryonic territories that are within or close to fgf sources, such as: the forebrain influenced by fgf8/12/ <dig> from the anr  <cit> , the midbrain and the hindbrain influenced by fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> respectively, the precardiac mesoderm influenced by fgf <dig> from the endoderm  <cit>  and the otic placode under the influence of fgf <dig> from the hindbrain and fgf <dig> from the mesoderm  <cit> . this is in agreement with other works in mouse  <cit>  and chick  <cit> , in which the localization of perk1/ <dig> is compared with the expression profile of fgfrs1- <dig>  mkp <dig> and the pea <dig> subfamily of ets factors during early embryonic development. hh <dig> embryos display a perk1/ <dig> gradient extending anteriorly and posteriorly from the caudal hindbrain. this gradient is consistent with the expression of fgf <dig> in this territory. at later stages, perk1/ <dig> is localized throughout the hindbrain, being more intense in the mhb. therefore, our results suggest that the initial activation of perk1/ <dig> in the caudal hindbrain depends on a local fgf source within this area rather than being the tail of a gradient established in more rostral areas. this idea is supported by our analysis of the fgf-activity readout mkp <dig>  mkp <dig> is expressed in two domains within the hindbrain, a more rostral one in the mhb and a more posterior one in the caudal hindbrain. between these two domains there is a region of the rostral hindbrain that does not express mkp <dig>  suggesting that this region has lower levels of erk1/ <dig> activity. on the contrary, although pea <dig> is also initiated in two different domains, at later stages it is expressed throughout the hindbrain. this could reflect that mkp <dig> and pea <dig> transcriptions require different thresholds of erk1/ <dig> activity to be induced. we have analyzed the expression of spry <dig> and flrt <dig>  two other genes belonging to the fgf synexpression group. the negative modulator spry <dig> is highly expressed in the mhb and r <dig> but shows weak and very transient expression in the hindbrain . this expression does not fully coincide with the expressions of fgf <dig> or mkp <dig> in the caudal hindbrain since it is slightly anterior to them. the positive modulator of fgf activity flrt <dig> was observed in the anterior part of the neural tube but not in the caudal hindbrain . this gene is later restricted to the mhb  <cit> . therefore, genes from the fgf synexpression group are expressed in a dynamic and tissue-dependent manner. since the role of these genes is to regulate fgf signaling  or to modulate gene expression in response to fgf signals , it is likely that regional and temporal variation in the levels of expression of these genes during embryogenesis can tune fgf signaling in each particular event. how this context-specific tuning is achieved is largely unknown.

fgf activity in the caudal hindbrain is mediated by the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway with no involvement of the pi3k-
akt pathway
the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway is the most widely reported pathway in fgf-required developmental processes  <cit> . in certain cases pi3k-akt pathway is proposed to act together with the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway in either synergistic or antagonistic manners  <cit> . we show that activated effectors of both pathways are present in protein extracts from hindbrains of hh8- <dig> embryos, suggesting that both pathways are active in this tissue. however loss-of-function studies of these pathways showed that only the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway is involved in the hindbrain patterning.

mkp <dig> has a very specific function in dephosphorylating erk1/ <dig> and thus inactivating the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway. two models, one in the limb development and the other in the isthmic organizer, propose mkp <dig> as a pivotal molecule in mediating crosstalk between pi3k-akt and ras-erk1/ <dig> pathways  <cit> . both models propose that mkp <dig> is induced by the pi3k-akt pathway to turn off the ras-erk1/ <dig>  our observations demonstrate that in the hindbrain the expression of the mkp <dig> is dependent on the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway but independent of the pi3k-akt pathway. thus, in the caudal hindbrain, mkp <dig> would be mainly involved in the autoregulation of the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway rather than in mediating crosstalk with the pi3k-akt pathway. this is in agreement with a model proposed both in limb development and neural induction  <cit> . recent work by ekerot et al . strongly supports the hypothesis that mkp <dig> is the mediator of an autoregulatory loop within the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . this analysis shows that the activation of the mkp <dig> promoter by fgf signaling is erk1/2-dependent and requires an intact ets-binding.

mkp <dig> induction is detected as soon as  <dig> hours after fgf <dig> overexpression and by  <dig> hours is expressed throughout the hindbrain. mkp <dig> is also induced  <dig> hours after vhnf <dig> overexpression suggesting that this gene is regulated by vhnf <dig> through fgf signaling. conversely, mkp <dig> was downregulated in the caudal hindbrain as soon as  <dig> hours after blocking fgf signaling or the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway. these timings are consistent with experiments in which fgf-beads grafted in the chick epiblast induced mkp <dig> within  <dig> and  <dig> hours  <cit> . this induction was counteracted within  <dig> and  <dig> hours by adding a bead coated with the fgfr inhibitor su <dig> or the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor pd <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this indicates that mkp <dig> is a highly sensitive fgf readout that responds quickly to variations in fgf signaling within the hindbrain. this quick response could be important to differentiate between punctual and sustained stimulation of the fgf-erk1/ <dig> pathway and, therefore, for modulating the different array of responses that this pathway can promote.

the expression of the rhombomeric markers krox <dig> and mafb is only dependent on the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway. thus, fgf signaling mediates caudal hindbrain patterning through the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway. previous findings in zebrafish support this hypothesis: when vhnf <dig> is co-expressed with a constitutively active form of erk in the zebrafish embryo the val/mafb gene is ectopically induced, just as occurs when co-expression of vhnf <dig> and fgf <dig> is performed  <cit> . in addition, fgf blocking inhibits krox <dig> and mafb expression only if inhibitor treatment is done before the onset of these genes, this is 5ss for mafb and 7ss for krox <dig>  thus, it seems that vhnf <dig> and fgf-erk1/ <dig> signaling are needed for early establishment of krox <dig> and mafb expression rather that for their maintenance. consistently, certain evidences suggest that maintenance of krox <dig> and mafb expression depends on autoregulatory mechanisms  <cit> . fig.  <dig> depicts data obtained in several groups: the first hindbrain molecular boundary is established in r4/r <dig> by mutual repression of irx and vhnf <dig>  <cit> ; once vhnf <dig> is expressed in the caudal hindbrain, it rapidly induces fgf <dig>  <cit> . finally, vhnf <dig> and fgf <dig> would cooperate via ras-erk1/ <dig> to induce mafb and krox <dig> in the caudal hindbrain  <cit>  and fgf signaling would be regulated by mkp <dig> 
, which activates the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway. vhnf <dig> and fgf3-erk1/ <dig> co-operate for the induction of mafb expression in r <dig> and r <dig> at 4-5ss and krox <dig> in r <dig> at 6-7ss. krox <dig> induction is probably also dependent on mafb expression as suggested in mouse and zebrafish  <cit> . krox <dig> is initially expressed in a narrow domain caudal to r <dig> and subsequently expands its expression area due to non-cell autonomous induction. coinciding with the onset of krox <dig> in r <dig>  vhnf <dig> progressively regresses to r <dig> between  <dig> and 10ss. mutual repression between vhnf <dig> and krox <dig> may prevent expansion of krox <dig> to r <dig>  anterior is to the left.  putative regulation of mafb and krox <dig> expression by vhnf <dig> modulating fgf signaling through mkp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we show that mkp <dig> is the readout of fgf <dig> activity in the hindbrain, and ras-erk1/ <dig> activity is necessary for mkp <dig>  krox <dig> and mafb induction. therefore, these results suggest that the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway is involved in mediating fgf signaling during caudal hindbrain patterning with no apparent contribution of the pi3k-akt pathway. taken together, the data presented in this work and previous knowledge leads us to propose a model in which vhnf <dig> is the molecular switch that initiates the process of r <dig> and r <dig> specification. vhnf <dig> rapidly induces fgf <dig> in the caudal hindbrain, which activates the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway. vhnf <dig> and fgf3-erk1/ <dig> co-operate for the induction of mafb expression in r <dig> and r <dig> at 4-5ss and krox <dig> in r <dig> at 6-7ss.
