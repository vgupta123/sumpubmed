BACKGROUND
nanoparticles offer many technological solutions since they are valuable as carriers, coaters, repellents, screens and conductors. nanoparticles may also be useful as nanosensors, cell-imaging devices and smart delivery systems and appear to be promising devices for application in the agriculture and food industries.

while the full potential of new nanomaterials is still far from being explored, their impact on living systems shows that different type of toxic effects may be imposed, depending on the type and concentration of nanoparticle as well as the time of exposure, among other factors. nanotoxic effects have been detected at relatively high, in many cases unrealistic, particle concentrations and associated with cell death, but subtler effects that arise at lower concentrations without necessarily causing cell death also need to be considered. in particular, a number of mechanisms were envisage underlying the ability of nanoparticles to cause dna damage  <cit> . it was found that quantum dots can damage dna by factors such as surface coatings  <cit> .

quantum dots  are fluorescent semiconductors extensively used in biological studies  <cit> . cdse-core qd are often used for these studies because they are easily prepared, have size tunable properties, a narrow emission band and a broad absorption spectrum. they can be coated with zns in order to protect the core from oxidation and other degradation processes that could release cd ions into the medium  <cit> . 3-mercaptopropanoic  coated cdse/zns quantum dots  are readily prepared by the ligand exchange/phase transfer method  <cit> . they are small and stable water soluble qd due to the carboxyl groups  <cit>  and this facilitates their uptake by biological systems. the mercapto group of the mpa provides a suitable ligand for attachment to the lewis acidic zn atoms on the qd. however, this is a relatively weak bond and some dissociation could occur  <cit> .

in a previous study, we showed that medicago sativa cells growing in suspension culture accumulated mpa-cdse/zns-qd in the cytosol and particularly in the nucleus  <dig>  <cit> . this accumulation induced the production of undifferentiated ros in a dose dependent manner and it was shown that a maximum concentration of  <dig> nm should be cyto-compatible  <cit> . we also showed that cell suspension cultures exposed to  <dig> nm of mpa-cdse/zns-qd during 48 hours did not show any noticeable production of superoxide radicals , and the production of h2o <dig> was far less than  <dig> nm, if any  <cit> .

little information has been found in the literature on the expression and activity of plant detoxifying enzymes and dna repairing enzymes in response to contact with nanoparticles. plants respond to toxicity by producing ros that trigger the activation of ros scavenging mechanisms. these mechanisms include the superoxide dismutase  enzyme, the water-water cycle, the ascorbate-glutathione cycle , the glutathione peroxidase cycle and the catalase  enzyme  <cit> . most reports on the effect of cd on the activity of these enzymes indicate that there is a decrease or no variation in the activity of these enzymes when plants were subjected to concentrations in the micromolar range  <cit> .

genotoxic effects have been reported when nanoparticles interact with living systems. silver nanoparticles exhibited cytotoxicity by decreasing the mitotic index in a dose dependent manner in root tips of allium cepa <cit> . it was also reported that cd damaged nucleoli in root tip cells of a. cepa <cit>  and altered the synthesis of rna and inhibited ribonuclease activity in rice  <cit> . it was demonstrated that  <dig>  nm of non-coated cdse/zns qd cause dna fragmentation and nicking in cell-free systems  <cit> . very high doses of mercaptoacetic cdse-qd undoped and doped with cobalt induce genotoxicity in mouse tissues  <cit> , but so far there are no reports on the genotoxicity of mpa-cdse/zns qd on plant cells.

in this work, the cyto- and genotoxic effects of mpa-cdse/zns qd in medicago sativa cells in suspension culture were analyzed. it was shown that some of the ros scavenging mechanisms are active at the cellular level, preventing the accumulation of some specific ros when cells were exposed to these qd. moreover, it was demonstrated that extensive dna damage occurs when a  <dig> nm solution of mpa-cdse/zns qd is placed in contact with plant cells and that the expression of the dna repair genes top  <dig> and tdp is activated by the stress imposed by this type of nanoparticles.

RESULTS
mpa-cdse/zns qd trigger the activity of antioxidant enzymes
knowing that plants exposed to high temperatures increase their anti-oxidant activity  <cit>  we have established a positive control for the triggering of antioxidant enzymes. for that, we used a heat shock treatment that involved exposing the cell cultures to 50°c for 20 minutes. under these conditions, an increase of about 50% in the activity of sod, cat and gr was recorded .

sod activity increased 12%, 27% and 88% when m. sativa cells were exposed to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm of mpa-cdse/zns qd respectively . the interaction of mpa-cdse/zns qd with plant cells triggers sod activity, and this may explain why, in a previous study  <cit> , we could not detect o2–• accumulation when m. sativa cells were exposed to mpa-cdse/zns qd. within a cell, sods constitute the first line of defence against ros, catalyzing the dismutation of o2–•. oxygen activation may occur in different compartments of the cell where an electron transport chain is present, such as the cytosol, mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes and glyoxysomes  <cit> .

cat activity increased by 8%, 16% and 72% of cat when m. sativa cells were exposed to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm of mpa-cdse/zns qd respectively . this significant increase in the activity of cat suggests a constant detoxification of h2o <dig> when m. sativa cells are exposed to mpa-cdse/zns qd. catalase is active only at relatively high h2o <dig> concentrations. low levels of h2o <dig> are eliminated by ascorbate peroxidases  and other peroxidases with the aid of various reducing metabolites such as ascorbate and glutathione  <cit> .

glutathione reductase  activity increased by 5% and 23% when m. sativa cells were exposed to  <dig> and  <dig> nm solutions of mpa-cdse/zns qd respectively , while  <dig> nm mpa-cdse/zns qd induced a gr activity that was not significantly different from the control.

it is possible that the increase in the activity of sod, cad and gr could be due to the liberation of cd ions following mpa-cdse/zns qd degradation. we did not observe this degradation. kirchner et al.  <cit>  showed that poisoning of normal rat kidney fibroblasts by mpa-cdse/zns particles due to the release of cd2+
 ions only starts at concentrations of around 6 μm of surface cd atoms. neither  <dig> nor 10 μm cd ions inhibited the growth of tobacco by <dig> cells in cell suspension cultures and 100 μm cd induces a decrease of sod and cad  <cit> . in fact, a decrease, and not an increase, of the activity of antioxidant enzymes has been associated with cd toxicity in different plant species  <cit> .

as seen for other oxidative stresses in plants, plant cells respond to the presence of quantum dots by mobilizing ros scavenging mechanisms to protect the cells from activated oxygen forms. this activation seems to be dose dependent and serves to prevent the accumulation of h2o <dig> and o2–• when cells are exposed to mpa-cdse/zns qd concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> nm.

mpa-cdse/zns qd induce dna damage in exposed plant cells
four different versions of the comet assay were used to estimate the range and type of genotoxicity imposed by mpa-cdse/zns qd in m. sativa cells: the neutral version, useful to assess dna double strand breaks ; the alkaline/neutral version  that detects mainly dna single strand breaks ; the a/n version followed by an enzymatic treatment with formamidopyrimidine dna glycosylase , to evaluate the extent of purine base oxidation; and the a/n version followed by the enzymatic treatment with endonuclease iii  to determine the amount of oxidized pyrimidine bases. the two enzymes remove the oxidized bases and generate a dna strand break at the position of the excised base that can be detected via the comet assay  <cit> .

figure 2a shows the a/n comet assay histogram distribution of cell suspension cultures added to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm solutions of mpa-cdse/zns qd, or heated at 50°c for 20 minutes. figure 2b shows images of comets that represent the five classes used for visual scoring. the control shows that 77% of the comets fall into class  <dig> and  <dig> while only 4% fall into classes  <dig> and  <dig>  this may be considered a basal level of damage that may reflect the impact of protoplastization. except for the  <dig> nm concentration, an increment of mpa-cdse/zns qd induces an increase in the frequency of comets in the higher classes. when cells are exposed to  <dig> nm mpa-cdse/zns qd, 78% of the comets fall into class  <dig> and 13% and 8% of the comets fall in class  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. heat-treated cells present 25% of comet frequencies in classes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and 10% in class  <dig> and  <dig>  these results show that stressed plant cells undergo dna ssbs and that increasing concentrations of mpa-cdse/zns qd increment the amount of damage.

the results of the four variants of the comet assay were plotted together in figure  <dig>  strikingly, contact with  <dig> nm of mpa-cdse/zns qd induced an increase in the number of dsbs when compared to the control, contrasting with the results obtained for the single strand break analysis. at the highest mpa-qd concentration tested purine bases were more oxidized than the pyrimidine ones.

the accumulation of ssbs and oxidative induced base lesions can lead to dsbs, considered the most lethal type of dna oxidative damage  <cit> . compared with other types of dna damage, dsbs are intrinsically more difficult to repair and as little as one dsb lesion in the dna can kill the cell if the lesion deactivates a critical gene. ssbs and oxidatively induced dna base lesions are known to block dna transcription and replication processes, resulting in accelerated cytotoxicity and genomic instability  <cit> . it seems that even  <dig> nm mpa-cdse/zns qd may induce dna double strand breaks in plant cells, being potentially deleterious and that the increment of nanoparticles induces an increase in genotoxicity.

mpa-cdse/zns qd up-regulate dna repair and antioxidant defence genes
oxidative dna damage is typically associated with the accumulation of  <dig> -dihydro-8-oxoguanine , an oxidized form of guanine. the 8-oxo-dg is highly mutagenic frequently inducing mispairs with the incoming damp during dna replication and causing g:c to t:a transversions. the base excision repair  is responsible for recognizing and excising damaged bases by a multi-step process using different enzymes, such as dna glycosylases, ap endonucleases or dna ligases. formamidopyrimidine dna glycosylase  is a dna glycosylase/ap lyase enzyme involved in the repair of oxidized purines such as 8-oxo-dg and imidazole-ring opened purines   <cit> . initially the presence of fpg was considered a unique feature of prokaryotes, but recently it has also been detected in plants  <cit> .

the transcript accumulation of the fpg gene was evaluated in m. sativa cell suspension cultures exposed to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm mpa-cdse/zns qd. changes in the expression levels of the fpg gene were observed during the induced treatments . an up-regulation was observed when the higher qd concentrations  were used , which is in agreement with the comet results: cells tend to respond to a genotoxic effect by increasing the expression of fpg to increase the enzyme activity.

tyrosyl-dna phosphodiesterase  is a key enzyme that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond between the tyrosine residue of dna topoisomerase i  and the dna 3′-phosphate, and thus it is involved in the repair of topoisomerase i – mediated dna damage  <cit> . macovei et al.  <cit>  reported on the presence of a tdp <dig> gene family  in m. truncatula and demonstrated its involvement in oxidative stress responses while lee et al.  <cit>  isolated tdp1-depleted arabidopsis mutants that exhibited a dwarf phenotype and cell death events, suggesting that this enzyme plays a decisive role during plant development.

the accumulation of transcripts of the β isoforms of tdp <dig> and top <dig> was evaluated in m. sativa cell suspension cultures added to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm mpa-cdse/zns qd. results  show an increase in the transcript accumulation of both tdp1β and top1β mrnas. in the case of tdp1β, a  <dig> -fold increase was observed at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, while the addition to  <dig> nm qd induced a  <dig> -fold transcript accumulation. the expression of the top1β gene did not show a significant change when  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm of cd were added while when  <dig> nm was added a  <dig> -fold increase was observed.

this is the first time that the expression of genes of dna repair enzymes has been evaluated with nanoparticles in contact with plant cells. the over accumulation of transcripts of fpg, tdp1β and top1β shows these nanoparticles are exerting a genotoxic effect that the cells try to counteract by increasing the expression of these genes. this is corroborated by the data obtained from the comet assays, that show that even  <dig> nm of mpa-cdse/zns qd may induce a genotoxic response by plant cells. the fact that the expression of apx and sod genes is also up-regulated by the nanoparticles , mostly at the highest concentrations, is in agreement with the results obtained for the antioxidant enzyme activities during a previous study  <cit> . the balance between ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity in cells is considered to be crucial for determining the steady-state level of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . these enzymatic antioxidant defences protect the cells by directly scavenging hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals, converting them into less reactive species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although not lethal, concentrations as low as  <dig> nm of mpa-cdse/zns qd may be cytotoxic and genotoxic to plant cells. this sets a limit for the concentrations to be used when carrying out experiments on plants using nanoparticles of this type.

as previously reported  <cit> , when in contact with the plant cell suspensions, some nanoparticle aggregation was observed. at  <dig> nm this occurrence is small, but is amplified at higher concentrations. aggregation may mask an even higher level of stress caused by these nanoparticles at higher concentrations than  <dig> nm, preventing their absorption into cells.

m. sativa cells responded to the oxidative stress caused by the addition of mpa-cdse/zns qd by activating their antioxidant enzyme systems. in this study, three antioxidant enzymes: sod, cat and gr were activated within 48 hours of mpa-cdse/zns qd exposure, preventing over-accumulation of h2o <dig> and o2–•, as shown previously  <cit> . higher concentrations of mpa-cdse/zns qd may induce the accumulation of ros that are able to damage the plasma membrane, mitochondria and nucleus.

cells adapt to the imposed stress by up-regulating antioxidant and/or repair systems. this may protect them against damage to some extent, or sometimes even overprotect them; the cells are then resistant to higher levels of oxidative stress imposed subsequently  <cit> .

this is the first report on the genotoxic effects of mpa-cdse/zns qd in plant cells and demonstrates that both the dna repair genes  and the ros scavenging mechanisms are activated when these qd interacts with m. sativa cells.
