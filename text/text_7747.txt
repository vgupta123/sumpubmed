BACKGROUND
evolution of a microbe is often driven by its environment or life-style. microorganisms adapted to some specialized environmental conditions have been reported to display conspicuous genome and/or proteome features  <cit> . species of widely varying taxonomic origins, but thriving in same/similar environmental conditions such as high temperature or high salinity, may converge to similar genome and/or proteome composition. in contrast, closely related bacterial species inhabiting distinct ecological niches may display substantial genomic diversity  <cit> . unveiling the plausible causes/consequences, at the genome and proteome levels, of such niche-dependent evolution of the microbial world poses a major challenge to the present-day life-scientists. the marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus marinus  <cit> , having multiple ecotypes exhibiting distinct niche-specific phenotypic as well as genotypic characteristics, offers a useful system to address this issue.

prochlorococcus are one of the most abundant life forms on this planet and more importantly, are major contributors to global photosynthesis  <cit> . a variety of prochlorococcus strains, each specialized to dwell in different conditions of light, temperature and nutrient abundances  <cit>  dominate the euphotic zones of the ocean - mostly between latitudes 40°s and 40°n, and sometimes beyond. to date, the complete genomes of  <dig> different strains of p. marinus have been sequenced  and wide variations have been observed in genetic architectures, genome sizes and genomic g+c-content of these strains  <cit> . on the basis of vertical niche partitioning, these  <dig> strains are classified into two major prochlorococcus ecotypes: high light adapted  ecotype being most abundant in surface waters and low light adapted  ecotype dominating deeper waters  <cit> .  <dig> of the sequenced strains have been identified to belong to the ll group and the other  <dig> have been found to survive at hl conditions  <cit> . the phenomenon of oceanic niche differentiation for p. marinus has been previously investigated into - and several inferences regarding the effects of light adaptation, nutrient availability and predator influence on their genome evolution and diversification has been arrived at  <cit> . however, the full expanse of ecologically relevant differences in genomic, physicochemical and physiological characteristics among these strains are yet to be explored. in the present study, we have attempted to identify novel niche-specific molecular signatures in the genome and proteome compositions of  <dig> different prochlorococcus strains, and also investigated the adaptive strategies of different prochlorococcus strains for their survival in diverse oceanic environments.

it is worth mentioning in this context that prochlorococcus is the first documented example of genome shrinkage along with a+t enrichment in a free-living organism  <cit> . earlier examples of genome reduction had been restricted to endosymbionts or pathogens with a host-dependent lifestyle, which evolve under the constraint of frequent population bottlenecks with a subsequent increase in genetic drift  <cit> . considering the abundance of p. marinus in the marine ecosystem, their reductive genome evolution might not be influenced by similar population bottlenecks and resulting genetic drifts, and thus seems to be a more complex phenomenon to explain. although p. marinus genome evolution has been investigated previously  <cit>  and the event of genome shrinkage have been ascribed to various factors related to their growth in oligotrophic waters  <cit> , selection for metabolic economy  <cit> , loss of low fitness genes  <cit> , and smaller cell sizes  <cit> , it is still unclear to what extent it has been driven by any random genetic drift and/or other specific selection force. our analyses indicate that the ecotype-specific molecular signatures exhibited by p. marinus strains under study are not mere remnants of a continuous genetic drift, but a potential outcome of niche-oriented stepwise diversification of prochlorococcus, orchestrated by an array of interplaying adaptive forces.

RESULTS
in an attempt to understand the trends in molecular evolution in prochlorococcus, we have analyzed various genome and proteome characteristics of  <dig> ll and  <dig> hl strains of p. marinus. the analyses of genome/proteome in p. marinus include the study of trends in codon, dinucleotide and amino acid usages, gene synteny of orthologous sequences, intergenic sequence composition, physicochemical properties of the encoded proteins and the extent of positive selection among different strains. these analyses were primarily directed towards the identification of niche-specific variations within different prochlorococcus strains.

strand-specific asymmetry in synonymous codon usage in low light adapted p. marinus genomes
in order to find out the trends in synonymous codon usage, we have carried out correspondence analysis  on relative synonymous codon usage  of  <dig> different strains of p. marinus. figure  <dig> shows the positions of the individual genes on the planes defined by the first and second major axes generated by coa on rscu values of coding sequences of respective prochlorococcus genomes under study. interestingly, in cases of all ll strains, the genes transcribed from the leading and the lagging strands of replication are segregated in two distinguishable clusters , either along axis <dig> or axis <dig> or both. similar scatter plots with two distinct clusters of genes were observed earlier in cases of microbial genomes with pronounced strand-specific mutational bias  <cit> . when the positions of all synonymous codons are plotted on the plane defined by the first and second major axis of coa on rscu for genes of all ll strains , a clear separation between g-/u- ending codons and a-/c- ending codons is observed, indicating the presence of asymmetric mutational bias at synonymous codon usage level in low light  adapted genomes of p. marinus. in contrast, for each of the hl strains, a single cluster of genes  is found on the axis1-axis <dig> plane of coa on their rscu values , suggesting the absence of any pronounced strand-specific asymmetry in their synonymous codon usage. for all ll strains, gt3-content of genes exhibit significant correlations with axis <dig> and/or axis <dig> values .  <dig> of the  <dig> ll strains, viz. ll <dig>  ll <dig> and ll <dig> show highly significant correlations between axis <dig> and gt3-content of genes, whereas ll <dig>  ll <dig> and ll <dig> strains show significantly high correlations between axis <dig> and gt3-content . in ll strains the positions of the leading and lagging strand genes on the planes defined by axis <dig> and axis <dig> of coa , therefore, clearly indicate the overall gt3-richness of the leading strand genes. however, for the hl strains of prochlorococcus, the percentage of variance explained by the first two principal axes are relatively low and the correlation values of these axes with gc3- or gt3-contents of genes are either insignificant or much lower than those observed for ll strains . this suggests that no single axis and/or parameter can explain strand-specific variations in synonymous codon usage of hl strains.

correlations significant at p < 10- <dig> are indicated in boldface.

chi-square tests on occurrences of different codons on two replicating strands of representative ll strains  further reveal significant overrepresentation of  <dig> and  <dig> g-/u- ending codons on the leading strands of ll <dig> and ll <dig> respectively ; while  <dig> and  <dig> a-/c- ending codons are overrepresented in the genes encoded on the lagging strands of ll <dig> and ll <dig> respectively  . the codon 'cug' is the only exception, which, in spite of being g-ending, is significantly overrepresented in the lagging strand genes of ll <dig> 

in microbial genomes characterized by pronounced strand asymmetry  <cit> , replicational-transcriptional selection usually play a major role in shaping genome organization. the leading strands of replication of such organisms, in general, contain higher number of genes due to replicational selection, and are also enriched with highly expressed genes as an effect of transcriptional selection. however, in ll strains of p. marinus, the predicted protein coding sequences are found to be distributed almost equally in two strands. in fact, in three ll strains , the number of predicted protein coding sequences are lower in the leading strands than in the lagging strands , indicating the absence of replicational selection. the lagging strands of the strains mit <dig>  and mit <dig>  are also found to be enriched in ribosomal proteins, which are typically highly expressed. only two such genes are encoded by each of their leading strands, leaving  <dig> and  <dig> ribosomal proteins to be encoded by their lagging strands . for other ll strains, the distribution of ribosomal genes is quite conventional . however, most of the other potentially highly expressed genes , are present in higher numbers in the leading strands of all ll strains. hence it is difficult to arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the effects of transcriptional selection on the ll strains of prochlorococcus.

larger extent of genomic rearrangements between small and large p. marinus genomes
in order to understand the nature and extent of genomic rearrangements during the events of niche specific diversification, we have analyzed the conservation of the relative order or synteny of orthologs across the chromosomes of different p. marinus strains. figure  <dig> represents graphically, the gene synteny of  <dig> orthologs  in three low light  and two high light adapted  strains of p. marinus. the low light strains of prochlorococcus have considerable variations in their genomic size and g+c-content . the ll <dig> strain here represents the high g+c and large genome containing ll strains, while the ll <dig> & ll <dig> strains represent the other members of the ll group which have lower g+c-content and reduced genome size. hl <dig> and hl <dig> strains are representatives of the hl group, which also share smaller genome and lower g+c content. interestingly, the extent of variation in order and orientation of orthologous genes between two strains of similar light optima but of distinct genome sizes and g+c-content , is significantly greater than that between two strains with distinct light optima, but having similar genome size and g+c-content . it is worth mentioning at this point that this conclusion holds good for all  <dig> p. marinus strains under study, i.e., the results will be similar even if the representative strains selected here are replaced with any other strains form the groups they represent. the analysis, therefore, suggests that genome reduction in p. marinus has been accompanied by numerous seemingly random genome rearrangements such as translocations and inversions. amongst the reduced genomes, the order and orientation of orthologous gene clusters remain more or less conserved except some local reorientation of genome fragments, the number and extent of reorientations being higher between the strains with distinct light adaptation .

niche-specific dinucleotide abundance values of p. marinus genomes
it has been reported previously that dinucleotide abundance values are usually similar in related species and can be regarded as a genome signature  <cit> . to understand the patterns in dinucleotide signature, we have calculated dinucleotide abundance values for all p. marinus genomes and also for e. coli . the genomic g+c-bias of e. coli is similar to that of ll <dig> and ll <dig> prochlorococcus strains. the results are shown diagrammatically in figure  <dig>  some prochlorococcus-specific trends are exhibited by all p. marinus organisms under study, irrespective of their g+c-bias or ecological adaptation. for instance, the dinucleotide cg is appreciably overrepresented in e. coli, but significantly underrepresented in all p. marinus, including the strains which have similar g+c-content to that of e. coli. contrasting trends in e. coli and p. marinus strains are also observed for the dinucleotides ag/ct and ga/tc. the dinucleotide abundance values of ac/gt are also significantly underrepresented in all p. marinus strains, but not in e. coli.

however, significant intra-prochlorococcus differences are also present in dinucleotide abundance profiles, on the basis of which all p. marinus strains under study may be divided into three distinct groups:

 group lla, comprised of the two ll strains p. marinus mit  <dig>  and mit  <dig>  - both having larger genomes  and average g+c-content ≈ 50%: genomes of these two strains are characterized by significantly high values of ca/tg and low values of ta . the values for at, ac/gt and cg are also relatively higher and that of cc/gg are lower, as compared to other p. marinus strains.

 group llb, consisting of other four ll strains , characterized by relatively lower g+c-content  and small genome size : these four ll strains exhibit highly similar patterns, which are visibly distinct mainly at ca/tg and cc/gg from the almost overlapping profile of hl strains .

 group hl, including all  <dig> hl strains having reduced genome and g+c-content ≈ 31%: the dinucleotide cc/gg is significantly overrepresented only in the hl prochlorococcus strains.

clustering by amino acid composition reveals a balance between genomic g+c-bias and prochlorococcus-specific selection forces
in an attempt to investigate whether the strand-specific mutational bias has any impact on amino acid usage in gene products of ll strains of p. marinus in comparison to their hl counterparts, we performed correspondence analysis  on relative amino acid usage  of the encoded proteins of each organism. no clear segregation can be observed for proteins encoded by the leading and lagging strands in any of the p. marinus genomes under study , implying that the strand-specific mutational bias has hardly any influence on the amino acid compositions of the gene products of ll strains of prochlorococcus. in all the strains of p. marinus, the first three axes generated by coa on amino acid usage cumulatively explain about 39% of the total variability. both mean hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the encoded proteins exhibit strong correlations with either of the first two principal axes and seem to be the major contributors to amino acid usage variation in p. marinus proteins .

in order to check whether the amino acid usage patterns in ll and hl groups of prochlorococcus follow any specific trends, we carried out a clustering analysis on relative abundances  of different amino acid residues of each organism  in a dataset comprising of all p. marinus strains under study along with a cyanobacterial representative cyanothece sp. , and two non-cyanobacterial species - the bacteroidetes/chlorobi g. foresetii  and the epsilon-proteobacteria c. jejuni . branching patterns suggest an optimization between the g+c-bias and p. marinus group-specific selection for amino acid usage. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  a major branching between the organisms occurs according to the average genomic g+c-content. organisms having average g+c-content around 50% - viz. e. coli, cyanothece sp. and the two lla strains - cluster together under the node 'a', while the organisms with lower g+c-content  form a distinct cluster at the node 'b'. however, within the a+t-rich or relatively g+c-rich clusters, finer segregation occur according to taxonomy, i.e., between the cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial species. for instance, node 'a' acts as a bifurcation point between the gamma-proteobacteria e. coli and the three cyanobacterial species, followed by another bifurcation at node 'c' between the two lla strains and non-prochlorococcus species cyanothece. similarly, within the a+t-rich cluster, the hl strains of p. marinus with g+c-content ≈ 30-31% club together with their llb counterparts  under the node 'f', distinctly separated from c. jejuni and g. foresetii. node 'f' also acts as the point of divergence of llb and hl strains, which cluster separately under the nodes 'g' and 'j' . these observations indicate that though the amino acid usage patterns in prochlorococcus are primarily guided by their directional mutational bias, other selection pressures must also have exerted some significant influence. three cyanobacterial species, namely cyanothece sp., p. marinus str. mit <dig>  and p. marinus str. mit <dig>  - all have nearly the same g+c-content as e. coli, yet their amino acid usage abundance patterns are quite distinct from that of e. coli. similarly, the llb and hl strains of p. marinus display significant differences in amino acid usage patterns from that of non- p. marinus species  having similar g+c-content. a careful examination of figure  <dig> delineates the prochlorococcus-specific features in amino acid usage patterns. for instance, as compared to e. coli, thr is underrepresented in all strains of p. marinus, including those having ≈ 50% g+c-content . ser is overrepresented in all a+t-rich p. marinus species, especially in comparison to c. jejuni and g. foresetii. tyr is typically underrepresented in all prochlorococcus strains, compared to the non-prochlorococcus species of similar g+c-content. frequency of phe is also relatively lower in prochlorococcus in comparison to any other species of similar g+c-bias. all these observations suggest that the amino acid usage in p. marinus is a result orchestrated by the forces of species-specific selection acting on mutational bias and genetic drift.

niche-specific variations in physicochemical and structural features of prochlorococcus orthologs
in an attempt to have a better insight into the niche-specific physicochemical and structural properties of p. marinus proteins, if any, we performed a comparative analysis of the core proteins, i.e., proteins found to be present in all p. marinus strains under study. different proteomic properties of  <dig> orthologous proteins between all  <dig> p. marinus strains are summarized in table  <dig>  which shows a gradual increase in average aromaticity and pi values and decrease in mean hydrophobicity and instability indices of orthologs, as one moves from the members of group lla to group llb to group hl. in other words, the core proteins of ll strains are, in general, more hydrophobic, more acidic, less aromatic and less stable than their hl orthologs. the comparison of structural properties reveals that among the three groups, members of the group lla exhibit the highest propensity for helix formation and lowest propensity for beta-sheet and coil formation. llb group orthologs are characterized by intermediate values for all three propensities, and group hl orthologs display trends opposite to that of group lla - i.e. lowest propensity for helix formation and highest propensity for beta-sheet/coil formation .

however, one may argue that these inter-group variations in physicochemical properties and structural propensities of p. marinus strains can only be a reflection of their varying genomic g+c-bias rather than being niche specific. in order to address this issue, we carried out a comparative analysis of various proteomic features of orthologous sequences from three representative p. marinus strains ll <dig>  ll <dig> and hl <dig>  with those of three other caynobacterial species, synechococcus elongatus , synechocystis sp. and nostoc sp. as well as three non-cyanobacterial species namely e. coli, bacillus cereus and francisella tularensis. the non-cyanobacterial species were chosen as reference organisms, due to their close average genomic g+c-content to those of lla, llb and hl strains , and the significant number of orthologs they share with these p. marinus strains. values of different physicochemical parameters and structural propensities of the orthologs from these reference species and the representative p. marinus strains are summarized in the table  <dig>  it reveals that the values of any specific parameter, say of hydrophobicity index or instability index, is in most cases, not comparable between orthologs from p. marinus strains and outgroup organisms of similar g+c-bias. for instance, the values observed for b. cereus are quite different from those of ll <dig> - the genomic g+c-content of both being quite similar. the average pi value of b. cereus proteins is not only significantly less than that of their ll <dig> orthologs, it is even lesser than ll <dig> proteins. the average instability index of b. cereus proteins is also much less than that of the prochlorococcus orthologs. the average helix forming propensity of b. cereus proteins is closer to that of ll <dig> proteins, while their beta sheet forming propensity is almost same to that of hl <dig> proteins. similarly, the aromaticity and instability indices or helix forming propensities of e. coli proteins are significantly different from those of prochlorococcus strain ll <dig>  while most of the f. tularensis protein characteristics differ widely from those of the p. marinus hl <dig> strain with similar g+c-bias. comparing between the cyanobacterial species, amino acid indices and secondary structural traits of synechococcus  seem to be guided by its g+c-content . the hydrophobicity values and the helix-forming propensities of the other two cyanobacteria also gradually decrease with decrease in genomic g+c-content within the set. however, the other indices and structural traits of synechocystis and nostoc do not reflect any systematic co-variation with their g+c-bias. these observations suggest that the variations in proteomic features of prochlorococcus might not be a mere outcome of their g+c-bias, there could be significant influence of other selection forces as well.

higher positive selection between orthologs from strains with opposite light optima
in order to better understand the evolutionary trends in different p. marinus species having distinct genome composition and/or light adaptation, the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions  were calculated between  <dig> orthologous sequences of ll <dig>  ll <dig> and hl <dig> strains , and the number of genes showing positive selection  between each possible pair of organisms were determined. figure  <dig> depicts a venn diagram for the number of positively selected genes among the strains under study. out of  <dig> orthologs, maximum number of positively selected genes  is found between ll <dig> and hl <dig> - the strains that differ in genome size, g+c-composition and light adaptation. the strains ll <dig> and hl <dig> having nearly similar genome size and g+c-bias, but distinct light optima come next with  <dig> positively selected genes among them and the two strains ll <dig> and ll <dig> of the same light group, but distinct genome size and g+c-bias, exhibit the minimum number  of positively selected genes. among these three sets, there are several genes, which are positively selected between any two out of the three possible pairs of p. marinus strains under study. there are  <dig> genes selected positively between hl <dig> and either of the ll strains i.e. between the strains of two opposite light optima, irrespective of their g+c-bias and genome size.  <dig> genes are positively selected between the strains of distinct g+c-bias and genome size - between the relatively g+c-rich and large genome strain ll <dig> and either of the a+t-rich and reduced genome strains ll <dig> or hl <dig>  only  <dig> genes display common positive selection between ll <dig> and ll <dig>  and between ll <dig> and hl <dig> . thus, our study indicates the presence of a considerable positive selection pressure in diversification of the prochlorococcus core genome, which in turn, suggests an appreciable role of random genetic drift in vertical niche partitioning of the strains.

pronounced effects of directional mutational bias in the intergenic regions of hl p. marinus strains
in an attempt to examine whether the g+c-bias of intergenic regions of the different strains , follow trends similar to the respective coding regions, g+c-content of intergenic regions were calculated. the intergenic regions are, in general, more a+t rich than the overall genomic g+c-content of respective organisms . also, the a+t bias of intergenic regions are more pronounced in hl strains than their ll counterparts.

unconstrained intergenic regions are more prone to mutational change. accumulation of unfavourable mutations may render a coding region nonfunctional, facilitating its removal from the genome in course of time. we have identified probable remnants of coding sequences within intergenic regions of two representative prochlorococcus strains having reduced genomes . the g+c-content of these remnants are, in most cases, higher than that of average intergenic dna, but lower than the average g+c-content of the bona fide coding regions . these particular non-coding sequences, therefore, may be remnants of coding sequences that are in the process of being eliminated from the genome.

discussion
exhibition of a wide range of genomic g+c-content  and genome sizes  by different strains of p. marinus, and also their adaptation to different ecological niches - a situation encountered rarely in the microbial world - demand detailed investigation. we have performed a large scale comprehensive study to critically analyze the direction and strength of mutational pressure and genomic/proteomic determinants associated with the adaptation of these strains to oceanic environments subject to different light intensities. from this study it appears that  low light adapted  free living prochlorococcus strains exclusively show strand asymmetry in synonymous codon usage,  general trends in amino acid usage in lla, llb and hl strains differ appreciably,  distinct dinucleotide abundance profiles are exhibited by lla, llb and hl strains,  higher number of genes have undergone positive selection between the strains with distinct light optima, i.e., between ll and hl strains and  there are definite trends in variations of different physicochemical and structural features in core proteomes of different groups of prochlorococcus strains, which are not solely governed by their genomic g+c-bias. these observations, along with the findings on large-scale genome reduction associated with gradual increase in genomic a+t-content and extensive chromosomal rearrangements between different strains, strongly suggest a stepwise diversification of prochlorococcus strains, in course of their adaptive evolution .

among several genome/proteome signatures of p. marinus strains reported for the first time in this work, the most notable is the impact of pronounced replication-strand-specific asymmetry on synonymous codon usage, observed exclusively in the low light adapted strains of p. marinus . this is noteworthy for two reasons:  presence of pronounced strand-specific mutational bias with detectable influence on codon usage was observed so far mostly for obligatory intracellular microorganisms having reduced genomes  <cit> . interestingly, all  <dig> ll strains of p. marinus exhibiting strand-specific synonymous codon usage are free-living and two of them  are characterized by relatively larger genome size. on the other hand, for the reduced genomes of  <dig> hl strains, no perceivable sign of strand asymmetry could be seen in their usage of synonymous codons.  in most of the other microbial genomes with asymmetric mutational bias, the genes, especially the highly expressed ones, are present in the leading strands of replication in significantly higher numbers, the phenomenon referred to as replicational-transcriptional selection  <cit> . no such definite significant bias in gene distribution is observed in either of the strands of replication in the ll strains of p. marinus. strand asymmetry in codon usage of prochlorococcus, therefore, may not bear an explicit causality to the event of genome reduction or with replicational-transcriptional selection.

the homogenization of the strand asymmetric bias in the hl strains may be attributed, at least partially, to the absence of a specific type of dna repair enzyme muty. in previous studies of rocap et al.  <cit>  and dufresne et al.  <cit>  it have been shown that the enzyme muty is absent in the strain p. marinus str. ccmp <dig> , while it is present in p. marinus str. ccmp <dig>  and p. marinus str. mit <dig> . muty, an a/g-specific dna glycosylase, acts with mutt  and mutm  to avoid misincorporation of oxidized guanine  in dna and to repair the base mismatches a:8-oxog  <cit> . knocking out both mutm and muty in e. coli results in a  <dig> -fold increase of g:c to a:t transversions in comparison to the wild-type strain  <cit> . our analysis reveals  that muty is present only in the ll strains, but not in any of the  <dig> hl strains. the excess number of 'g's present in the leading strands of ll strains might have transversed to 'a's in the hl strains due to the absence of muty in the later, and this in turn, caused a simultaneous increase of 't's in the lagging strands, eventually leading to homogenization of the g+t and a+c frequencies in two strands of replication in the hl strains. existing mutational drift towards a+t-enrichment in the hl strains might also have facilitated achieving the uniformity in those strains. further insights may be accumulated in this regard with the availability of more completely sequenced prochlorococcus genomes in future.

in the process of gradual genome reduction, mutations often accumulate in expendable genes, thereby transforming them, by degrees, to pseudogenes, to small fragments, to extinction  <cit> . in the reduced genomes of p. marinus, we have found some putative remnants of coding regions, the a+t-content of which are, in general, higher than that of coding regions, but lower than other non-coding regions. this is in agreement with the fact that the reduced genomes of p. marinus  are subject to a strong mutational a+t-drift, and will therefore result in gradual a+t-enrichment of the genic remnants already released from amino-acid-coding constraints in recent past. the base composition of such remnants is expected to gradually approach the a+t-content of bona fide non-coding regions.

comparison of orthologous gene synteny from five representative strains having different genome size and g+c-content clearly points at a high level of chromosomal rearrangement during genome shrinkage in prochlorococcus. this finding is in agreement with earlier findings on association of chromosomal rearrangement events with higher rates of chromosomal evolution and/or the phenomenon of genome reduction, as in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and different endoparasites/endosymbionts  <cit> . intra-chromosomal recombination at duplicated sequences often results in deletion of intervening sequences, and rearrangement of flanking regions, thereby leading to genome shrinkage  <cit> .

previous analyses with endosymbiotic or endoparasitic organisms like bartonella, tropheryma, buchnera, wigglesworthia etc.  <cit>  revealed that the phenomenon of genome reduction is normally associated with population bottlenecks or other mechanisms such as selective sweeps. in case of the hyperthermophile nanoarchaeum equitans, extreme genome reduction is a feature of its thermoparasitic adaptation  <cit> . although our knowledge of bacterial populations in open oceans is not exhaustive, it may certainly be assumed that p. marinus ecotypes, the most abundant free-living marine cyanobacteria and an important contributor to global photosynthesis, are not subject to small population sizes  <cit> . more importantly, the hl strains with reduced genomes are apparently biologically superior than their ll counterparts  <cit> . it is possible that the bias towards reduced a+t rich genomes in hl strains is consistent with cellular economy at regions with limited nitrogen and phosphorous near the ocean surface. scarcity of these elements that are essential in dna synthesis favors the incorporation of an at base-pair containing seven atoms of nitrogen, one less than a gc base-pair. it is worth mentioning at this point that the trends in amino acid usage in different p. marinus strains, as observed in this study are quite compatible with the earlier report by lv et al.  <cit>  on influence of resource availability on proteome composition of these species. for instance, increase in overall aromaticity from lla to llb and hl strains is in full agreement with the observations by lv et al.  <cit>  on increased carbon-content in the encoded proteins of different hl strains as compared to that of ll strains. the average instability indices of the hl proteins are significantly lower than those of their ll orthologs, suggesting that the hl proteins, in general, may be more stable. proteins characterized by higher percentages of helix structures, experience increased overall packing that imparts more rigidity  <cit>  and, hence, a decrease in regions with helix-forming propensities with a subsequent increase in coiled structures in hl proteins probably makes them more flexible. it is also tempting to presume that higher values of aromaticity and pi in hl proteins, as compared to ll orthologs, might facilitate cation-pi interactions in the former, imparting more stability. the central issue in the adaptation of hl proteins to their environmental niches may, therefore, be the conservation of their functional state, characterized by a well-balanced optimization of stability and flexibility.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study advocates for the presence of adaptive selection forces that might have played significant role in governing prochlorococcus evolution and fitness at the genome and proteome levels. an optimization between these adaptive forces and directional mutational bias has set definite trends in molecular evolution of p. marinus. this characterizes different p. marinus ecotypes with distinct niche-specific compositional, physicochemical and structural traits, thereby driving them chronologically towards increasing stability and/or fidelity.
