BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle progenitors are specified as a population of multipotent mesodermal cells. these cells subsequently commit to a muscle fate and differentiate into muscle fibers by cell fusion and assembly of contractile myofibrils composed of myosin thick filaments and actin thin filaments. although the molecular mechanisms that regulate induction of muscle progenitors, commitment of these cells to the muscle lineage, and myoblast fusion are well characterized  <cit> , relatively less is known about the mechanisms that regulate the formation of myofibrils  <cit> .

the ladybird  protein is a member of the homeobox transcription factor family, characterized by an n-terminal engrailed repressor domain. in drosophila, lbx is expressed by progenitor cells, founder cells, and syncytial precursors of a larval somatic muscle, the segmental border muscle   <cit> . embryos lacking lbx function have missing muscle fibers, unfused myoblasts, or abnormally shaped cells in the sbm. ectopic lbx expression leads to the formation of enlarged or duplicated sbms  <cit> . recent studies showed that lbx is also required for establishment of morphological, ultrastructural, and functional properties of leg muscles in drosophila  <cit> . thus, the lbx gene functions in fusion of myoblasts, development of muscle fibers, and the establishment of muscle morphology in drosophila.

in mouse, two lbx genes, lbx <dig> and lbx <dig>  have also been identified  <cit> . lbx <dig> is expressed in a subset of hypaxial myoblasts that migrate into the limbs, tongue, and diaphragm. lbx <dig> is expressed in the central nervous system, in neural crest derived structures such as dorsal root ganglia and other parts of the peripheral nervous system, and in the urogenital system  <cit> . loss of lbx <dig> function results in lack of specific limb musculature, attributed to migration defects  <cit> . although, lbx <dig> knock out mice develop relatively normally, one study suggested that lbx <dig> functions in neural-derived tissues under the regulation of pax <dig>  <cit> . lbx <dig> has also been studied in xenopus, where it represses myod expression and promotes myoblast proliferation before the onset of terminal differentiation  <cit> . thus in both mammals and frogs, lbx <dig> is thought to function in migrating myoblasts, whereas functions of lbx <dig> are still unclear  <cit> .

many aspects of the molecular pathway that regulates myogenesis are conserved in drosophila and vertebrates  <cit> . however, because studies of vertebrate lbx have focused mainly on migration or proliferation of myoblasts in hypaxial myogenesis, little is known about whether lbx functions in other aspects of muscle development that have been characterized in drosophila, such as fusion of myoblasts, formation of fibers, or the establishment of muscle shapes. to study these potential roles of lbx in vertebrates, we examined lbx gene function in zebrafish. zebrafish axial skeletal muscles contain four fiber types; slow muscle, muscle pioneers, fast muscle, and medial fast fibers. slow muscle cells are located superficially just under the skin, with fast muscle cells located deeper  <cit> . muscle pioneers are located near the horizontal myoseptum that separates dorsal and ventral parts of the myotomes, and medial fast fibers are also located medially in the somite. we previously showed that adaxial cells located adjacent to the notochord are precursors of slow muscle cells and muscle pioneers  <cit> . adaxial cells are specified to form slow or muscle pioneers by hh signaling from the notochord  <cit> , then, slow muscle precursors migrate to the lateral surface of the somite  <cit> . after the somite forms, non-adaxial muscle precursors in the segmental plate differentiate into fast muscle cells. during this period, both slow and fast muscle precursors are dynamically rearranged in the somite  <cit> .

the zebrafish genome contains three lbx genes  <cit> .lbx <dig>  previously named lbx <dig>  is expressed in the ventral region of the somite, in the hindbrain, and in the fin bud  <cit> . lbx1a is expressed in the nervous system and fin bud  <cit> . analysis of lbx1b expression in zebrafish has not been previously reported <cit> .

here, we show that zebrafish lbx <dig> expression first appears at late gastrula stages  in cells near the margin that later form head muscle and pronephros. subsequently, lbx <dig> expression is present in the paraxial mesoderm and adaxial cells, which are the precursors of slow muscle and muscle pioneers  <cit> . although a subset of adaxial cells migrates into the somite during segmentation stages <cit> , lbx <dig> is not detected in slow muscle cells during or after their migration. as development proceeds to late segmentation stages, a subset of fast muscle cells in both dorsal and ventral regions of the somite turns on lbx <dig> expression that subsequently disappears by the second day of development. thus, myoblasts in both the slow and fast muscle lineages express lbx <dig> transiently. as development proceeds to the end of the second day, lbx <dig> expression is detected in fin bud and hyoid, similar to xenopus lbx <dig> expression. in contrast to lbx <dig>  lbx1b expression is not detected during gastrulation, but first appears in the hindbrain and caudal regions of the neural tube around the 5-somite stage. as development proceeds, a subset of cells lateral to the somites  begins to express lbx1b, whereas somite cells never express lbx1b. later, lbx1b expression is present in the fin buds. thus, myoblasts only in fin lineages express lbx1b. morpholino analysis shows that both lbx1b and lbx <dig> function in hypaxial myogenesis. in addition, although lbx <dig> is not required for induction of myogenesis or specification of zebrafish skeletal muscle cell fates, lbx <dig> is required for normal fusion of fast muscle precursors, as in drosophila. lbx <dig> also plays an important role in the formation of myofibrils by regulating expression of filament genes, such as myosin and actin. we further demonstrate that the engrailed repressor domain of the lbx <dig> protein is required for this induction of filament genes. thus, although previous studies in vertebrates have suggested that lbx <dig> functions in proliferation and migration of muscle precursors, our results demonstrate that vertebrate lbx <dig> also plays an important role as a regulator of muscle cell differentiation.

RESULTS
slow and fast muscle precursors transiently express lbx <dig> mrna
to study the function of lbx genes in vertebrate skeletal muscle development, we examined expression of lbx1b and lbx <dig> in zebrafish. previous analysis of lbx1a  <cit>  showed that it is not expressed in the somites, so we excluded it from this study. lbx <dig> expression becomes detectable by the 70%â€“80% epiboly stage . double labeling with no tail , which marks the blastoderm margin, reveals that lbx <dig> first appears adjacent to the margin  in the region that later contributes to head muscle and pronephros  <cit> . by the end of bud stage, lbx <dig> expression appears in paraxial mesoderm and adaxial cells , precursors of slow muscle cells and muscle pioneers  <cit> . lbx <dig> expression is not detected in the somites , even though a subset of adaxial cells, the slow muscle precursors, migrates through the somites during segmentation stages  <cit> .

to learn whether differentiated slow muscle cells express lbx <dig>  we double-labeled embryos for lbx <dig> mrna and with the f <dig> antibody, a marker of slow muscle  <cit> . we find that differentiated slow muscle cells do not express lbx <dig> . instead, lbx <dig> expression appears in the fast muscle domain by late segmentation stages . interestingly, we find that both dorsal and ventral fast muscle cells express lbx <dig> , whereas previous studies reported that lbx <dig> expression is restricted to ventral regions of the somite  <cit> . by  <dig> hours post-fertilization , lbx <dig> disappears from the trunk  and appears in fin muscles as previously described  <cit> . lbx <dig> is also expressed in a dorsal intermediate region of the neural tube and hindbrain  <cit>  and in the hyoid  <cit> .

unlike lbx <dig>  lbx1b expression is not detected during gastrulation. lbx1b expression first appears within a dorsal intermediate region of the neural tube by the 5-somite stage , and this expression extends along the rostral caudal axis by late segmentation stages . as development proceeds, a group of cells lateral to the somites  begins to express lbx1b , whereas muscle precursors in the somites do not express lbx1b. subsequently, lbx1b expression is detected in the fin bud . unlike lbx <dig>  the hyoid does not express lbx1b . thus, during myogenesis, lbx <dig> expression appears in paraxial mesoderm, precursors of slow and fast muscles of the somite, fin bud, and hyoid, whereas lbx1b is detected only in myoblast lineages of the fin.

conserved function of lbx in hypaxial muscle development
to examine lbx function in myogenesis, we knocked down lbx <dig> or lbx1b activity using specific splice blocking morpholino oligonucleotides . to confirm the specificity of the mos, we performed reverse transcriptase pcr on mrna from mo injected embryos. we find that injection of lbx <dig> or lbx1b splice donor mo results in production of aberrantly spliced lbx <dig> or lbx1b transcripts, respectively , indicating that splicing of lbx <dig> and lbx1b is blocked by the specific lbx splice donor mos.

previous studies suggested that lbx <dig> regulates the migration of limb, hypoglossal, and head muscle precursors in mouse and xenopus  <cit> . our observation that zebrafish lbx <dig> appears in fin bud and hyoid muscles suggests that lbx <dig> may be involved in regulation of hypaxial and head muscle development. we find that inactivation of lbx <dig> blocks formation of the fin bud and blocks myod expression in hyoid muscles . embryos injected with lbx2-mo express fgf <dig> normally in the ectoderm  <cit> , indicating that other aspects of fin bud development are unaffected by mo injection. in addition to lbx <dig>  zebrafish lbx1b is also expressed in the fin bud . injection of lbx1b-mo results in decreased myod expression in the fin bud, and again, fgf <dig> expression is normal . thus, zebrafish lbx <dig> and lbx1b are both required for proper development of hypaxial muscles that are derived from lbx <dig> and/or lbx1b expressing myoblasts, similar to xenopus and mouse lbx <dig>  <cit> .

functional roles of lbx <dig> in the induction of myogenesis and the migration of slow muscle precursors
our observation of transient expression of lbx <dig> in paraxial mesoderm and adaxial cells at the end of bud stage suggests that lbx <dig> might be involved in specification of muscle cells at this stage.  <cit> . however, we find no obvious changes in expression of myogenic regulatory factors such as myod expression in adaxial cells or myf <dig> expression in paraxial mesoderm in lbx <dig> knock down embryos , although a few myod expressing cells fail to incorporate properly into the adaxial cell layer  and the distinctive cuboidal shape of the adaxial cell pseudo-epithelium is somewhat disrupted in . transplantation analysis showed that, although morphogenesis of cells lacking lbx <dig> activity is affected, they still express myod when located adjacent to the notochord . these results indicate that lbx <dig> is not involved in the induction of myogenesis.

during segmentation stages, the slow muscle precursors, a subset of adaxial cells, migrate radially away from the notochord to form the superficial layer of slow muscle  <cit> . because adaxial cells transiently express lbx <dig> , we examined whether lbx <dig> is involved in their migration. cross sections of lbx2-mo injected embryos indicate that muscle precursors migrate properly through the somite to form the superficial layer . transplantation analysis also showed that cells lacking lbx <dig> function migrate properly to the superficial layer in uninjected embryos . thus, in the absence of lbx <dig> activity, mesodermal cells form muscle precursors, as indicated by myod and myf <dig> expression, and slow muscle precursors migrate normally to the lateral surface of the somite.

absence of lbx <dig> activity results in malformed slow muscle cells
to explore the functions of lbx <dig> further, we examined the number and structure of differentiated slow muscle fibers. double labeling with prox <dig>  and 4d <dig>  demonstrated that the number of slow muscle  and muscle pioneer cells  is unaffected by injection of lbx <dig> splice donor mo or lbx mrna , indicating normal proliferation of slow muscle precursors and differentiation of slow muscle precursors into slow muscle and muscle pioneers. thus, the specification and numbers of slow muscle cells and muscle pioneers are regulated independently of lbx <dig>  on the other hand, however, we find that lbx <dig> splice donor mo injected embryos fail to form normally shaped slow muscle fibers . injection of lbx <dig> translation blocking mo produced the same phenotypes as lbx <dig> splice donor mo . further analysis showed that although slow muscle cells normally contain extended and thickened myofibrils by  <dig> hpf , lbx <dig> splice donor mo injected embryos exhibit shorter and thinner myofibrils . these malformed slow muscle fibers are still present at  <dig> hpf . it is unlikely that these defects are due to a general developmental delay because other aspects of development, including muscle precursor cell migration  and rostral caudal extension of the somites  occur normally. thus, lbx <dig> contributes to formation of myofibrils in slow muscle cells.

fast muscle fibers form abnormal in the absence of lbx2
because fast muscle cells transiently express lbx <dig> around  <dig> hpf , we also examined the structure of fast muscle cells. the eb <dig> antibody specifically recognizes fast myosin heavy chain protein  <cit> . we find that, although fast muscle cells in control embryos contain extended myofibrils by  <dig> hpf , lbx <dig> splice donor mo injected embryos form shorter myofibrils , and these shortened myofibrils are still present at  <dig> hpf . however, we observe no apparent difference in thickness between control and lbx <dig> splice donor mo injected embryos . thus, formation of myofibrils in fast muscle cells also depends upon lbx <dig> function.

in zebrafish, fast muscle cell precursors are fusing by  <dig> hpf, and the majority of fast muscle cells are multinucleate  <cit> . in drosophila that lack lbx function, myoblasts fail to fuse  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether fusion of fast muscle cells is affected by knockdown of lbx <dig> activity in zebrafish. fast muscle cells in somite  <dig> are multinucleate by  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf in both control and lbx2-mrna injected embryos, whereas many fast muscle cells remain unfused in lbx <dig> splice donor mo injected embryos . in addition, unfused cells sometimes exhibit a curved shape. thus, both the formation of myofibrils and the fusion of fast muscle precursors depend upon lbx <dig> activity.

interference with lbx <dig> activity downregulates myofilament gene expression
our finding that knockdown of lbx <dig> activity results in malformed slow and fast myofibrils suggested that expression of genes encoding components of the sarcomere may depend upon lbx <dig> function. we therefore examined the expression of genes encoding components of thin, thick, and elastic filaments. skeletal muscle alpha-actin , skeletal muscle troponin t , fast skeletal muscle tropomyosin , skeletal fast troponin t3b , and fast skeletal muscle troponin c  encode thin filament proteins  <cit> . both slow and fast muscle cells express acta <dig>  slow muscle cells express tnnt <dig>  and fast muscle cells express tnnt3b  <cit> . we find that expression of the thin filament genes, acta <dig>  tnnt <dig>  tpma, and tnnt3b is reduced in lbx <dig> deficient skeletal muscles, although tnnc expression appears normal . skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain , slow type myosin binding protein c , slow myosin heavy chain  <dig> , fast muscle specific myosin heavy polypeptide  <dig> , and fast skeletal muscle myosin light chain  <dig> encode thick filament proteins  <cit> . slow muscle cells, including muscle pioneers, specifically express mybpc <dig>  <cit> , and fast muscle cells express myhz <dig>  <cit> . expression of the thick filament genes, myhz <dig>  mybpc <dig>  and myhz <dig> is reduced in embryos lacking lbx <dig>  whereas smyhc and mylz <dig> expression is normal . titin encodes a component of elastic filaments  <cit> . in contrast to thin and thick filaments, expression of titin is not affected by lbx2-mo. thus, deficiency of lbx <dig> activity results in decreased expression of specific thin and thick filament genes.

the engrailed domain of lbx <dig> is required for regulation of myofilament gene expression
in xenopus, overexpression of lbx <dig> causes a decrease of myod expression and an increase of myf <dig> expression in hypaxial myoblasts, and the engrailed repressor domain of lbx <dig> is required for this function  <cit> . to learn whether the engrailed domain of zebrafish lbx <dig> is required for myofilament formation, we tested whether lbx <dig> protein that lacks the engrailed domain, rescues lbx2-mo injected embryos. lbx2-mo results in decreased atca <dig> and mybp <dig> expression  and lbx <dig> mrna rescues atca <dig> and mybp <dig> expression in lbx2-mo injected embryos . however, mrna encoding lbx <dig> that lacks the engrailed domain fails to rescue atca <dig> and mybp <dig> expression in lbx2-mo injected embryos . in contrast to atca <dig> and mybp <dig>  mef2c and myogenin expression is upregulated by lbx2-mo injection  and suppressed by overexpression of lbx <dig> mrna . lbx <dig> mrna rescues mef2c and myogenin in lbx2-mo injected embryos . however, mrna encoding lbx <dig> that lacks the engrailed domain fails to rescue mef2c and myogenin in lbx2-mo injected embryos. thus, the engrailed domain of lbx <dig> is required for lbx <dig> function during the formation of myofilaments.

discussion
previous studies suggested that lbx <dig> regulates the migration of limb and hypoglossal myoblasts in mouse  <cit> . recently, an additional function of lbx <dig> was reported, whereby lbx <dig> represses myod expression and promotes myoblast proliferation before the onset of terminal differentiation  <cit> . in contrast, functions of lbx <dig> are poorly understood, because lbx <dig> deficiency does not impair mouse development  <cit> . here, we demonstrate in zebrafish that lbx <dig> is expressed in mesodermal cells, migratory slow muscle precursors, fin bud, and hyoid  <cit> , whereas lbx1b is expressed only in fin bud during myogenesis. loss of lbx <dig> function does not apparently affect induction of myogenesis, slow muscle migration, or proliferation, but rather reduces cell fusion, as in drosophila, and, furthermore, lbx <dig> knockdown blocks differentiation of myofibrils due to reduced expression of specific thin and thick filament genes.

slow and fast muscle precursor cells transiently express lbx2
lbx <dig> expression appears by the end of bud stage in paraxial mesoderm and in adaxial cells, the precursors of slow muscle including muscle pioneers. a subset of adaxial cells migrates through the somite during segmentation stages  <cit> , but lbx <dig> is not expressed in nor required for migration of these cells. interestingly, a subset of fast muscle cells begins to express lbx <dig> in both epaxial and hypaxial domains by the end of segmentation stages. a previous study in zebrafish concluded that lbx <dig> expression is restricted to ventral regions of the somites  <cit> . this discrepancy could be due to the rather weak expression of lbx <dig> in the epaxial domain , which may have been missed in the earlier study. by  <dig> hpf, expression of lbx <dig> disappears from somites in the trunk. similarly in xenopus, the ventrolateral region of rostral trunk somites, which contains precursors of hypaxial body wall, expresses lbx <dig>  and this expression later becomes weak and eventually lost  <cit> . satellite cells in mouse that express lbx <dig> also extinguish expression during myogenic differentiation  <cit> . thus, lbx gene expression may be transient during myogenesis in all species.

during muscle development in chick, the myotome forms in three waves  <cit> . the first wave of early post-mitotic progenitors appears along the entire dorsomedial aspect of the epithelial somite. then in the second wave, cells migrate from all four lips of the dermomyotome, although myofibers are generated from only the rostral and caudal edges. during the third wave, there is a balance between differentiation and proliferation. similarly, zebrafish muscle development can be divided into several steps. first, epithelial adaxial cells, precursors of slow and muscle pioneers, are specified to be slow or muscle pioneers by hh signaling from the notochord  <cit> . then, slow muscle precursors migrate to the lateral surface of the somite  <cit> . second, a wave of fast muscle morphogenesis is induced by the migration of the slow muscle precursors  <cit> . finally, new slow-muscle fibers are added in growth zones near the dorsal and ventral extremes of the myotome, and this muscle growth continues into larval life  <cit> . we demonstrated that lbx <dig> expression first appears in adaxial cells. adaxial cells lose lbx <dig> expression before they incorporate into the somite. then, a subset of fast muscle precursors begins to express lbx <dig>  further analysis is required to determine whether lbx <dig> is transiently expressed in all or only a subset of muscle precursors and whether such transient expression is linked to particular waves of muscle development.

migration of slow muscle precursors in lbx <dig> knockdown embryos
in mouse, disruption of lbx <dig> causes a severe loss of limb muscle, because muscle progenitors fail to migrate  <cit> . we showed that disruption of lbx <dig> activity causes decreased myod expression in fin bud and hyoid muscles , suggesting that lbx <dig> could be involved in migration of these precursors in zebrafish. additionally, we previously reported that a subset of adaxial cells migrate laterally to form slow muscle  <cit> . the expression of lbx <dig> in adaxial cells raised the possibility that lbx <dig> may regulate migration of slow muscle precursors, too. although transplantation analysis showed that the early movement of cells lacking lbx <dig> is disrupted during gastrulation , slow muscle precursors eventually migrate radially . therefore, although it is likely that lbx <dig> contributes to the migration of fin and head muscle precursors, lbx <dig> is not required for migration of slow muscle precursors.

a molecular link between lbx <dig>  a transcriptional repressor, and filament gene expression
the lbx <dig> protein contains the engrailed repressor domain  <cit>  and lbx <dig> protein that lacks the engrailed domain fails to suppress myod expression in xenopus  <cit> . moreover, lbx <dig> interacts with corl <dig>  a transcriptional corepressor  <cit> . these observations strongly suggest that lbx <dig> functions as a transcriptional repressor. we find that lbx <dig> that lacks the engrailed domain fails to induce atca <dig> and mybpc <dig> in lbx2-mo injected embryos, and also fails to suppress mef2c and myogenin in lbx2-mo injected embryos . this result indicates that the engrailed repressor domain is required for function of lbx <dig> in the formation of myofibrils. however, our observation that lbx2-mo leads to a decrease in filament gene expression suggests that filament genes cannot be direct targets of lbx <dig>  instead, this result indicates that lbx <dig> acts through an intermediate factor  to regulate expression of filament genes.

myogenin and mef <dig> are known to function in filament formation  <cit> , and we showed that expression of both myogenin and mef2c is reduced by overexpression of lbx <dig>  thus, myogenin and mef2c may act downstream of lbx <dig> to regulate myofilament gene expression during formation of myofibrils. however, myogenin and mef2c are thought to function as transcriptional activators. our observations that myogenin and mef2c expression is upregulated in lbx2-mo injected embryos, whereas filament gene expression is decreased by lbx2-mo, suggest that there must be other factors downstream of lbx <dig>  most likely additional transcriptional repressors. thus, further studies are required to identify the proximal downstream mediators of lbx <dig> function.

CONCLUSIONS
several steps are required for muscle progenitors to form functional skeletal muscle:  formation of a population of multipotent mesodermal cells,  specification and commitment to a muscle fate, and  differentiation accompanied by cell fusion and assembly of contractile myofibrils. the precise timing of these steps requires a fine balance between transcriptional activation and repression  <cit> . although many transcriptional activators and repressors involved in commitment, specification, and differentiation of muscle precursors have been identified  <cit> , the transcriptional network that regulates terminal differentiation is still incompletely understood. our study has identified lbx <dig> as a regulator of myofibril formation through its action on expression of myofilament genes, including myosin and actin. a recent study showed that undifferentiated satellite cells express lbx <dig>  and lbx <dig> expression diminishes as cells differentiate  <cit> . in addition, it is known that lbx <dig> upregulates pax <dig> expression and downregulates myod in satellite cells  <cit> , and we also find suppression of pax <dig> expression in lbx2-mo injected embryos . thus, it is possible that lbx <dig> maintains the immature state of satellite cells by regulating pax <dig>  based on these observations, we suggest that the general function of lbx <dig> may be to aid differentiation of myoblasts by promoting fusion and myofilament gene expression.
