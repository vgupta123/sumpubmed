BACKGROUND
worldwide structural genomics projects continue to release new protein structures at an unprecedented pace. to date nearly  <dig> proteins were solved in the nih-based protein structure initiative, according to the weekly updated target tracking system structural biology knowledgebase  <cit> . stunningly, approximately 30%  of these new structures lack any type of functional characterization  let alone a specific description of residues critical for function. while sometimes the annotation of the fold that emerges from structural studies of a given target can provide a coarse functional classification  <cit> , for the most part these structures do not have follow up functional studies. this presents a strong demand for computational methods that aim at identifying possible functional sites in these structural models. the most frequent and basic approach to functionally characterize proteins in general is to transfer functional annotation between proteins based on sequence similarity  <cit> , typically after searching sequence databases with tools like blast  <cit>  or other sensitive, profile based search approaches  <cit> . while these methods can provide useful information, their applications are limited to proteins with high sequence similarity to other functionally characterized proteins and it is prone to, and partly responsible for, the propagation of errors in functional assignment  <cit> . the fraction of experimentally validated annotation represents only about 5% of all proteins according to benchmarks made on enzymes  <cit> . estimates about the mis-annotation of enzymes  varies between 5-40%  <cit> . previous studies argued that sequence based approaches are reliable only if at least 40-50% sequence identity exists between two proteins. for example, in the case of enzymes, a similar  function can be assumed between two proteins if their sequence identity is above 40%, but if the sequence identity drops in between 30-40% then only the first three enzyme commission  numbers can be predicted reliably, and only at 90% accuracy level. below 30% sequence identity, structural information is necessary to essential for functional annotation  <cit> . meanwhile it is estimated that 75% of homologous enzymes share less than 30% identical positions  <cit> . other surveys reported that less than 30% of enzymes that share more than 50% sequence identity will have identical ec numbers  <cit> . given that the average sequence identity between structurally related proteins is ~8-9%, and most of these share less than 15% identity  <cit> , we must expect a high degree of functional diversity in proteins with similar folds  <cit> . this indicates an imperative need for structures and structure based approaches for functional annotations of these proteins.

an alternative approach to functional annotation, which also provides a more detailed insight, is the identification of residues that are critical for protein function. the expected benefit is that the knowledge of residues important for protein function can serve as a guide to experimental approaches, such as mutational studies, to test, confirm, or manipulate function. methods for identifying functional residues can be broadly divided into those based solely on sequence information, those that rely on structural information, and those that combine the two in their predictions. for sequence based methods, analysis of multiple sequence alignments  is the most informative procedure. typically, a msa is constructed after searching a sequence database, and then each column of the msa is evaluated and a conservation or an entropy score is assigned to the column. scoring the msa can be complemented with prediction of secondary structures, relative solvent accessibility, or catalytic propensity of amino acid types. for instance, crpred  <cit>  uses the position specific substitution matrix and entropy values extracted from the msa, hydrophobicity values calculated in a variable-sized window, and the separation between catalytic residue pairs in the protein sequence for training a support vector machine. another sequence-based method, frcons  <cit> , calculates a score related to the relative entropy, and uses the predicted solvent accessibility and secondary structure to estimate the background distribution of each residue. a class of sequence based methods use a msa and a phylogenetic tree for a protein family  <cit> . the tree is analyzed from the root to the leaves searching for patterns of conservation at each node, looking to define residues important for function of the entire family or residues that are specific for each subfamily. if a structure is known, the residues identified can be further mapped onto the surface of the protein. structure based methods are very diverse in their approaches. a variety of methods were developed that perform an unbiased search  for recurring structural motifs  <cit> . these methods are powerful when similar functionalities exist in different folds, or when function is explored in a structurally divergent superfamily. one unbiased structure based technique that has been repeatedly used in various applications relies on graph theory. using the atomic coordinates of the amino acid residues, pairs of interacting residues are identified and the information of a protein structure is converted into a network of interacting residues. the residue pairs are used to build the edges of a graph, where the nodes are the residues and the edges represent interactions. once a graph is made, one can score the relative importance of each residue  in the protein  by calculating a variety of possible centrality measures, which are often assumed to be good predictors of functional residues. the underlying assumption in these approaches is that functional residues display a pattern of connectivity to the rest of the protein that ranks higher than the pattern of non-functional residues. while most of the methods that use a graph approach complement the centrality measures with sequence based scores , sarig  <cit>  finds pairs of interacting residues with the csu program  <cit> , and predicts catalytic residues based on closeness centrality values combined with relative solvent accessibility. other features used for structure based prediction include the analysis of mechanical properties of each residue  <cit>  because catalytic residues are assumed to be more difficult to move with respect to other residues in the protein. other structure based approaches take into account the shape of the protein surface, looking for the largest clefts in the structure, where catalytic residues tend to reside  <cit>  or the “deepest” yet still exposed residues  <cit> . in thematics  <cit> , a graph of proton occupation against ph is prepared for each ionizable residue; functional residues display distortions in these graphs, and are identified by having at least one other such residue in the vicinity.

methods that rely exclusively on sequence information are valuable when no structural information is available. however, when the structure of a protein is known, the best performing methods make use of both sequence and structural information. sequence conservation is probably the most powerful attribute for identification of functional residues, and some flavor of sequence conservation analysis is present in virtually all these hybrid methods. thiebert et al.  <cit>  build a graph of interacting residues and calculate the degree, degree- <dig>  clustering coefficient and closeness for each node, and conclude that the best predictor relies on closeness centrality and phylogenetic analysis. here, the degree of a node is the number of nodes directly connected to it, that is, nodes that are exactly one edge apart. the degree-n of a node is the number of nodes that are exactly n edges apart. a related approach uses degree, degree- <dig> and residue type combined with the propensity of each residue type to be catalytic, which is calculated as a percentage over their database of catalytic residues  <cit> . petrova et al. uses sequence conservation, catalytic propensity of amino acids, solvent accessibility and relative position to the clefts of the structure  <cit> , while cilia and passerini combines these sequence based measures with other physicochemical traits of structural neighborhoods, defined as those residues contained in a spherical region of  <dig> angstrom centered on each amino acid in the structure  <cit> . the partial order optimum likelihood  method  <cit> , improves on the analysis of the structure-based thematics method, by extending it to non-ionizable residues and combining it with sequence conservation and cleft size information using a svm.

in this paper, for the purpose of feature selection, we explore the pairwise correlation between some of the attributes most frequently used for the prediction of functional residues, namely, the centrality measures of closeness, betweenness and page-rank, in addition to distance to the general center of mass   <cit> , relative solvent accessibility  and sequence conservation. we found that several of the graph based features strongly correlate with one another and with the distance to gcm but capture only partially the signal of functional residues. we explore possible combinations of these inputs for training neural networks, and identify a simple set of factors for efficient selection of catalytic residues based on sequence and structural information. we also explored the effect of the rapidly changing reference databases on the accuracy of residue conservation calculations and observed a strong dependence, which suggest that approaches that include this feature must be either regularly recalibrated or a specific reference database must be designated.

RESULTS
feature selection to predict functional residues
methods for the identification of functional residues rely on a wide variety of attributes that differentiate functional and non-functional amino acids. these features include sequence conservation, closeness, betweenness, rsa, distance to the gcm, and many others. some of these measures are related to one another, which means that some seemingly different methods are in fact analyzing the same underlying property. therefore, we first analyzed the  <dig> structures in the training dataset  and scored every residue for each of the attributes included in this study. then, we calculated the cross correlations between variables used, to shed light on the relatedness among existing methods for predicting functional residues  in the remainder of this paper, when we discuss functional residues, we will be referring to those annotated as catalytic in the csa database  <cit> , unless otherwise noted in the context.

conserv: sequence conservation; distance: distance to general center of mass; closeness: closeness; between: betweenness; pagerank: pagerank, rsa: relative surface accessibility.

from the results , it is immediately clear that sequence conservation shows the highest correlation with function, as has been suggested in several previous studies  <cit> . interestingly, function also shows a relatively high absolute correlation with distance to gcm and closeness, followed by betweenness. perhaps not surprisingly, distance of an amino acid residue to the gcm has a high negative correlation with closeness, a reflection of the fact that residues near the center of the protein are relatively close to all other residues in the protein, and this is captured in the graph of interacting residues. likewise, other node centrality measures vary negatively with the distance of the residue to the gcm. all the node centrality measures are highly correlated to one another, indicating that in these graphs, a residue with a high centrality value according to one measure is likely to have high centrality according to another measure. we used these insights in our exploration of the optimal set of features used as inputs to neural networks prediction for the identification of functional residues.

correlation of functional and non-functional residues with all the features studied
the coarse analysis with the pearson’s correlation coefficient between function and each of the features studied  suggests that it is possible to separate functional and non-functional residues based on each of the attributes analyzed, perhaps with the exception of rsa, which shows almost no correlation. to visualize this segregation, we plotted the cumulative distributions of functional and non-functional residues as a function of each variable. there is a clear separation between the two curves characterizing functional and non-functional residues for all the attributes studied . the greatest discrimination between functional and non-functional residues is achieved with conservation analysis , followed by distance to the gcm . closeness also gives good separation but then the curves are closer to each other for the remaining variables. separation of the curves, therefore, is in agreement with the global correlation values, except for rsa, where the curves are well separated starting at approximately 10% rsa but they cross each other for lower rsa values. in this training set, approximately 30% of the functional residues have rsa of 5% or less, and approximately 10% are completely buried. this is consistent with previous reports on the overall accessibility of functional residues, and explains the low global correlation of rsa and function  <cit> .

neural networks
based on the observations described in the previous section, we set out to define a function for identification of functional residues, one that combines some or all of the features selected and returns a fraction of the input residues that is highly enriched in functional residues. according to the cross-correlation table, the use of some of the inputs is redundant and adds little to the overall result. since it is likely that the features have to be combined non-linearly for functional residue identification, we trained neural networks to integrate the different inputs into a single function. we used the information on the cross-correlation table as a guide to our exploration of the set of attributes presented to the neural networks. a set of  <dig> structures was randomly selected from the initial training set of  <dig> structures, and used as a validation set to make comparisons between the different training runs. the training of the neural network was done on the remaining  <dig> structures of the original training set . based on our results  and on previous reports that conservation is the most useful feature for identifying functional residues, we initially trained networks either with the entire set of residues or only with conserved residues, those with a relative entropy measure of  <dig>  or larger. residues were presented to the networks and analyzed with different combinations of measures for the attributes in table  <dig>  the best performing networks were those that used distance to the gcm and amino acid type as inputs . adding any other input always resulted in a reduced performance, as monitored with the matthew's correlation coefficient  on the validation set . table  <dig> shows that preselection of conserved residues always resulted in performance improvements with any combinations of inputs. consequently, we decided to optimize the step of preselecting residues based on sequence conservation, and used distance to the gcm and residue type as inputs to the neural networks. we retained the weights for the neural connections of the best performing network for further evaluation. figure 1a shows how selection of an appropriate sequence conservation level can increase the proportion of functional residues in the input set, by eliminating large numbers of non-catalytic residues, while retaining most of the catalytic ones. for example, elimination of residues with relative entropy of  <dig>  or less removes  <dig> % of non-functional residues but only  <dig> % of functional residues. after this trade-off step we retain  <dig>  out of  <dig>  functional residues and  <dig>  of  <dig>  non-functional residues of the entire training set, resulting in a set that contains approximately 5% functional residues, a nearly 5-fold enrichment over the original input. also, at a relative entropy value of  <dig> , the slope of the functional residue curve shows a dramatic increase, with a bigger increase at  <dig>  . a comparison with the slope of the non-functional residue curve indicates that beyond some point near  <dig>  we start discarding functional residues at a greater rate than non-functional residues, and this is reflected in the downward trend of the plain solid line in figure 1a. to confirm this visual observation, we preselected residues from the validation set using relative entropy values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in increments of  <dig> , and used each enriched set as input to the best performing network trained with residues that show entropy values of  <dig>  or better and with distance to gcm and residue type as the only attributes. the calculated mcc after feeding the various enriched sets to the neural network peaked when we discarded residues with a relative entropy value of less than  <dig> ; at this level, we retain  <dig> functional and  <dig> non-functional residues, producing a set that contains  <dig> % functional residues. we selected this value of  <dig>  for use in the final protocol, and to measure performance with the independent testing set of  <dig> structures.

c, sequence conservation; d, distance to the gcm; a, residue type; k, closeness. a check symbol on a column indicates that the feature was included in training. the matthew’s correlation coefficient, expressed as a percentage, was calculated on the validation set after convergence of the training procedure. networks were trained either with “all residues” or only with residues that showed a conservation value of  <dig>  or more. the calculation of the mcc was performed over the entire original set of residues, regardless of the effect of preselection on the overall counts.

comparison with existing methods
there is a paucity of publicly available methods for the prediction of functional residues based on protein structures. as a result, it is difficult to do a fair comparison of a newly developed method with other existing methods; therefore, we relied on the performance reports in the original publications. however, one should note that these performances were tested on different datasets and therefore cannot be compared with one another directly. the reportedly better performing methods  <cit>  appear to be demanding in terms of computational power, which also could be a possible explanation for their limited availability to the public. for instance, pool  <cit> , which supplements the proton occupation prediction of themathics with surface cleft and sequence conservation analysis, is one of the methods that report higher performance, with  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % precision, for a  <dig>  f1-measure value. using a 10-fold cross-validation protocol, cilia and passerini  <cit>  present a high 28% precision value at the expense of a relatively low 46% sensitivity, resulting in a  <dig>  value for the f1-measure. the method of cilia and passerini makes use of sequence information and the composition of structural neighborhoods. on the other hand, petrova and wu  <cit> , using sequence conservation, solvent accessibility and position relative to surface clefts, achieve high sensitivity  but low precision , producing a  <dig>  f1-measure score. our testing set consisted of  <dig> structures that were not used during the development process, containing  <dig> residues that were annotated as catalytic in catalytic site atlas out of  <dig> total, or  <dig> % functional residues. after applying the entire procedure, we selected  <dig>  of the input, which contained  <dig> of the catalytic residues . therefore, annotated catalytic residues make up  <dig> % of our output, representing an enrichment of over 14-fold when compared to the input set. to obtain a more robust measure of performance, we carried out a 10-fold cross-validation procedure on the entire dataset, after clustering at 30% sequence identity. the average sensitivity after cross-validation was  <dig> %, with an average precision of  <dig> % and an f1-measure score of  <dig>  .

table  <dig> shows how our figures compare to those from other methods of functional residue prediction. the only working server for structure based functional residue prediction that we found was that of sarig  <cit> , and we submitted our  <dig> structures for analysis. sarig uses closeness centrality and rsa to predict catalytic residues. our method clearly outperforms the structure-only sarig . it was also of interest to make a comparison with a sequence based prediction method, so we contacted the authors of crpred  <cit> , perhaps the best sequence-only method available, who graciously agreed to analyze our testing set. compared to crpred, our method has better sensitivity  but lower precision , resulting in a lower f1-measure . this was confirmed with a different dataset, the ef-fold set, originally used by youn et al.  <cit>  and later evaluated by crpred. table 3b shows the results of a 10-fold cross-validation analysis of the ef-fold dataset. our method achieved higher sensitivity than both crpred and the method of youn et al. but lower precision and f1-measure. youn et al. use the structural conservation score of s-blest  <cit>  together with sequence conservation and residue hydrophobicity as inputs to a support vector machine  <cit> . in the 10-fold cross-validation procedure, our method achieved higher sensitivity than crpred  and lower precision , with f1-measures of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. thus, our method is better at identifying functional residues  but crpred recognizes, and discards, non-functional residues at a higher rate , as does the method of youn et al. . this difference might be explained, at least in part, by the makeup of the training sets: for the balanced training of the neural network we used a 1: <dig> ratio of functional:non-functional residues, while crpred and youn et al. used at 1: <dig> ratio in their support vector machine based method. in any case, the performance of crpred is especially remarkable since it uses no structural information. in the next section we briefly explore one major aspect that can influence the results of sequence profile based analysis: the rapidly changing sequence databases.

effect of rapidly growing databases
sequence conservation is the most influential trait in many functional residue prediction protocols, including the one presented here. a necessary step in finding a conservation value of an amino acid residue is the comparison of a query sequence with all the sequences in an all-inclusive reference database. one obvious consequence of such comparison is that conservation values are sensitive to the size and redundancy of the selected reference database. this is of particular relevance given the exponential growth of sequence databases, and leads to the question of whether their overall information content is approaching some sort of saturation point. this would imply the unlikely condition that all types of sequence information entering the database provide only more redundancy. from a practical standpoint, a perceived saturation is necessarily tied to a query sequence, with some query sequences having hundreds or thousand of relatives, while others display few or none, depending on the parameters used in the search. thus, the overall performance measure of a method that relies on sequence conservation is affected by changes in both the specialized test database and in the reference sequence database, which are, for the method presented in this paper, the csa and the non-redundant protein database of ncbi , respectively.

an examination of the growth of csa, from its initial release in  <dig>  <cit>  through the latest release in  <dig>  indicates that the number of non-redundant protein chains with annotated catalytic residues extracted from the literature  has increased from  <dig> to  <dig> or 28% over  <dig> years. the number of annotated catalytic residues in those releases has grown proportionally, from  <dig> to  <dig>  for a 32% increase, indicating that there has been no dramatic change in the annotations. during the same period, nr has grown from about  <dig> million to  <dig> million sequences, which is more than a 600% increase. based on those raw numbers, any database-dependent change in the performance of a method over these years is likely due to the changes in nr, with the growth of csa having a modest effect. the relative growth of nr is magnified because csa is a relatively diverse database: for instance, clustering at 50% sequence identity decreases the effective size of csa by only approximately 5%. in contrast, the internal redundancy of nr is much greater. while measuring the size reduction of nr at different levels of sequence identity is computationally intensive, clustering at 50% sequence identity produces a 70% reduction in size in uniref  <cit> , and we expect a similar behavior for nr. this implies that the growth of nr comes largely at the expense of adding redundant information, in comparison to csa.

the analysis presented throughout this paper was done using a release of nr of march  <dig> as our reference database, when the size of the database was approximately  <dig> million sequences. the current release of nr, in september of  <dig>  already has approximately  <dig> million sequences, an additional growth of about 40% over the  <dig> release. to determine how the use of this new release affects our numbers, we recalculated our sequence conservation values with the current nr release, and found that using the test dataset of  <dig> proteins, the sensitivity value stayed the same at  <dig> % but the precision dropped from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %, resulting in an f1-measure score of  <dig> . the drop in precision was due to more residues meeting the minimum conservation value requirement of  <dig> , probably, as observed above, because more homologous sequences entered the database. therefore, we proceeded to identify a new optimal threshold value of  <dig>  for this increased and more redundant version of nr using the original testing dataset. with this new threshold, we obtained a sensitivity of  <dig> % and precision of  <dig> %, for an f1-measure value of  <dig> . thus, with the new database and the new threshold, we almost recapitulated some of the original performance figures of the  <dig> analysis. this exercise sheds light on the dynamic interplay between rapidly evolving and changing sequence databases and reveals the need for recalibration of parameters as the public databases change. this also highlights a complication in comparing performances of different methods over the years. sequence conservation based approaches either have to use a frozen reference database or need to be regularly updated and recalibrated.

illustration of predictions of functional residues
the results presented in the previous section are the aggregate figures over the entire testing set. although useful for the evaluation of the method as a whole, those figures provide little information on the specifics of each structure analyzed. in particular, the method failed to find any of the catalytic residues in six of the  <dig> structures of an expanded version of the testing set. meanwhile, it found all the annotated catalytic residues in  <dig> of the structures. as a comparison, sarig found no functional residues in  <dig> structures and all residues in  <dig>  both methods failed for one structure, 1bd <dig>  which corresponds to a toxoplasma gondii uracil phosphoribosyltransferase . five of the six structures for which our method failed, including 1bd <dig>  illustrate those cases where high sequence conservation is not seen in catalytic residues; however, there are conserved residues in those structures that are not annotated as catalytic. as shown in figure 1a, approximately 18% of the functional residues are eliminated at our required level of conservation. also, table  <dig> shows that residue conservation correlates with the distance to the center of mass. this is in accordance with previous reports, which observed that in addition to catalytic residues, those that are buried at the “core” of a structure show a rate of mutation lower than other residues in the structure  <cit> . residues that make the core are often responsible for the structural integrity of the protein so it is not surprising that they tend to be conserved; from this perspective, core residues could be regarded as essential for protein function since catalytic residues depend on a specific spatial distribution to act efficiently on a substrate  <cit> . because of the specifications of its design, our method is likely to return residues of the core.

in a successful case examined, the structure 1lcb of thymidylate synthase from lactobacillus casei thymidilate synthase, our method selected  <dig> of the original  <dig> residues or  <dig> % of the structure . the output contained all the  <dig> annotated catalytic residues for a 30% precision.

CONCLUSIONS
annotation of catalytic residues is an arduous task that is prone to errors. we limited our dataset to annotations for which there is experimental evidence reported in the literature, leaving aside annotations based on sequence similarity. still, those annotations are probably not perfect as illustrated by the case of 1b3r, for which slightly different sets of catalytic residues are reported in csa, which served as our source of data, and in the related catalytic residue set   <cit> , with histidine  <dig> found in csa but not catres. thus, some of the residues classified as false positives might in fact be involved in catalysis but not identified as such in csa.

prediction of functional residues is inherently difficult due to the often poor understanding of which residues play a critical role in protein function, in addition to those involved in a direct chemical reaction. it is assumed that residues responsible for catalysis evolve very slowly as catalytic capability imposes the strongest constraint on the fitness of an enzyme  <cit> . meanwhile, residues that are involved in substrate selectivity  have more flexibility, partly due to the variety of compensatory mutations that can establish a similar environment  <cit> . yet, other structurally remote residues, while not directly involved in the reaction or selectivity, might be critical for function by playing role in “promotional” vibrations for efficient catalytic reaction  <cit>  or fulfilling structural roles essential for activity  <cit> . methods that identify functional residues in fact may contribute to uncovering the network of residues responsible for function and to a better understanding of the role of the entire structure  <cit> .
