BACKGROUND
up-regulation of fatty acid synthase , the enzyme responsible for the endogenous synthesis of palmitate, is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer  <cit> . while normal cells obtain most fatty acids from circulating lipids, tumor cells have developed an increased reliance on endogenous fatty acid synthesis to satisfy their metabolic needs  <cit> . this elevation of fas occurs early in human cancer, is associated with aggressive forms of the disease, and is linked to poor prognosis  <cit> . consequently, strategies to target fas are becoming increasingly exploited as attractive approaches for cancer therapy.

fas is critically important for tumor cell survival and function; providing the necessary fatty acids for membrane formation and signal transduction  <cit> . the targeted knockdown of tumor fas by small molecule inhibitors or small interfering rna  has been shown to induce both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cultured cells and suppresses tumor growth in xenograft bearing mice  <cit> . this anti-tumor activity is linked to increased expression of p27kip <dig>  <cit>  and decreased akt phosphorylation  <cit> . fas inhibition can also lead to the transcriptional suppression of the her2/neu gene suggesting an active role for fas in gene regulation  <cit> . however, detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms linking inhibition of fas to these anti-tumor effects remains elusive.

in the present study, we utilized sirna, beadarray technology, and pathway analysis to define the genome-wide changes that take place following knockdown of fas . we have identified a core set of  <dig> genes representing the fas knockdown signature in the mda-mb- <dig> mammary carcinoma cell model. functional classification of these target genes, combined with quantitative pathway analysis, revealed extensive changes in metabolism, cell survival/proliferation, dna replication/transcription, and ubiquitin dependent protein degradation as a consequence of fas inhibition. taken together, our results provide a detailed overview of the anti-tumorigenic signaling network induced in tumor cells by the targeted knockdown of fas.

RESULTS
changes in gene expression resulting from knockdown of fas
mda-mb- <dig> mammary carcinoma cells were selected as the model for defining the fas knockdown signature. for our experiment, four independent sirna duplexes targeting fas  were chosen based on there ability to knockdown the enzyme and to induce tumor cell apoptosis after  <dig> h  <cit> . inhibition of fas by each duplex was verified using  <dig> nm of sirna as demonstrated by a decrease in fas mrna, protein, and fatty acid biosynthesis after  <dig> h relative to non-silencing control sirna . the non-silencing control sirna was selected based on minimal cross reactivity with known targets and had no impact on fas expression or activity when compared against lipofectamine  <dig> transfection alone . gene expression profiles were examined on two separate occasions following transfection with fas sirna. treatment times  were chosen to capture early and late gene changes associated with the block in cell cycle progression and the advent of apoptosis occurring in response to knockdown of fas. abrogation of fas  was verified within  <dig> h of transfection and persisted throughout the  <dig> h experiment. significant changes in cell viability were not observed  <dig> h post-transfection indicating cells were viable during the time of gene analysis .

the first approach we used in analyzing the effect of knockdown of fas on gene expression was to identify target genes modified by at least  <dig> of the sirna duplexes. the expression signature of each fas sirna was determined by identifying genes significantly changed over the time course using mb statistics and two way anova analysis. for each sirna duplex only genes with a p-value â‰¤  <dig>  and at least  <dig>  fold changes in both biological replicates at a given time point were maintained for expression analysis, and are published as supporting information online . the fas knockdown signature was defined as the overlap of significant gene changes occurring in response to at least  <dig> of the sirna duplexes with an average gene expression change  <dig>  fold that observed in controls. this allowed us to identify gene changes specifically associated with knockdown of fas, while at the same time eliminate potential off-target effects unique to the individual sirna sequences. using this approach, we identified  <dig> genes whose expression changed in response to knockdown of fas . alterations in gene expression occurred as early as  <dig> h after knockdown of fas with the majority of genes affected by  <dig> h . these results show that inactivation of fas has a profound affect on gene transcription.

knockdown of fas affected genes that regulate a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, dna replication, transcription and apoptosis . we found that the abrogation of fas enhanced the expression of several anti-proliferative genes including ccng <dig>  cdkn1a , spry <dig> and spry <dig>  this coincided with up-regulation of the cell surface apoptosis gene anxa <dig>  the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway gene apaf <dig>  and the death receptors tnfrsf10b  receptor) and tnfrsf <dig> . in addition, results showed knockdown of fas up-regulates sgpl <dig>  a key enzyme in sphingosine-1-phosphate metabolism whose increased expression also leads to accumulation of the pro-apoptotic signaling molecule ceramide  <cit> . this finding is consistent with reports that fas inhibition up-regulates ceramide synthesis, which has been found to be a necessary step leading to the induction of tumor cell apoptosis following the loss of fas  <cit> .

the fold change values represent the average from at least  <dig> of the fas sirna duplexes compared to non-silencing control sirna. genes were classified using go terminology from genespring and the ncbi nucleotide database. for detailed annotations of all  <dig> differentially expressed genes see additional file  <dig> 

several of the genes significantly altered by knockdown of fas are known to play a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. inactivation of fas increased the expression of insig <dig>  and the leptin receptors, lepr and leprotl <dig>  which block transcription, proteolytic cleavage and transcriptional activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein  family of transcription factors that promote lipid biosynthesis   <cit> . additionally, loss of fas led to down-regulation of id <dig> and id <dig>  which are dominant negative helix-loop-helix  proteins that bind srebp 1c and functionally repress fas promoter activity  <cit> . id <dig> and id <dig> also repress expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip <dig>  <cit> , thus, as expected the suppression of these genes in response to knockdown of fas was coupled with up-regulation of the p21cip <dig> gene . these data provide evidence of a direct link between regulation of fas and control of cell cycle progression.

another important biological category affected by knockdown of fas is regulation of protein ubiquitination . we found that knockdown of fas altered the expression of several e <dig> ubiquitin conjugation enzymes  and e <dig> ubiquitin ligases  which function to target proteins for degradation by the proteosome  <cit> . in addition, we identified up-regulation of  <dig> splice variants of ube2v <dig>  which are catalytically inactive e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . ube2v <dig> variants result from the co-transcription of ube2v <dig> with the neighboring upstream gene, kua, which shares sequence consensus to fatty acid hydrolases . this targeting of ubiquitination enzymes indicates that the knockdown of fas affects the tumor cell proteome not only through changes in transcription, but also on the post-translational level.

knockdown of fas leads to widespread changes in pathways involved in metabolism
the second approach we used to analyze the gene array results was to identify gene pathways coordinately up-regulated or down-regulated by knockdown of fas using gene set enrichment analysis . gsea is a unique application that coordinates small changes in gene expression from a large number of functionally related genes in order to identify pathways that are significantly changed  <cit> . as expected, fatty acid metabolism  was significantly suppressed by knockdown of fas . fatty acid elongation  was also reduced, which is consistent with the loss of available palmitate.

the effects of knockdown of fas on the expression of metabolic genes extended to pathways other than fatty acid metabolism . inactivation of fas down-regulated both the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis  and krebs-tca cycle  pathways. down-regulation of the krebs-tca cycle was consistent with an overall suppression in mitochondrial genes involved in energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation . furthermore, this down-regulation in genes regulating glucose utilization was coupled with a reduction in insulin signaling . this suggests that inhibition of fas may restrict the ability of tumor cells to produce the energy necessary to thrive.

knockdown of fas up-regulates pathways involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
the anti-tumorigenic effects of knockdown of fas were traced to an up-regulation in genes that modify tumor proliferation . gsea analysis showed that knockdown of fas up-regulated genes involved in dna damage signaling  and cell cycle arrest . induction of cell cycle arrest was coupled with up-regulation of the p <dig>  and rb  pathways consistent with our previous finding that fas regulates the g <dig> checkpoint through these pathways  <cit> . additionally, knockdown of fas elevated the expression of several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors , p15ink <dig>  and p21cip1) which function as negative regulators of the rb pathway  <cit> , demonstrating fas induces a high degree of regulation over the g1/s transition . results also showed that knockdown of fas elevated genes involved in the g <dig> pathway including the checkpoint regulators chek <dig>  wee <dig> and plk <dig> . these data indicate that fas controls tumor proliferation by regulating several aspects of the cell division cycle.

the apoptotic effects of knockdown of fas were recently shown to be blocked by co-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk  <cit> , suggesting a role for caspases in mediating fas induced tumor cell death. here, we found up-regulation of caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig>  in response to knockdown of fas . this was accompanied by enhanced expression of pathways and genes that activate caspase  <dig> such as tumor necrosis factor . gsea results also demonstrated compensatory up-regulation of nf-Îºb  and the map kinase  survival pathways in line with previous reports .

discussion
the present study provides a comprehensive overview of the genomic changes accompanying knockdown of tumor fas. to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that targeted knockdown of a metabolic enzyme can influence overall energy producing pathways within the tumor cell. the major findings of this work are as follows: first, sirna mediated knockdown of fas affects the transcription of genes involved in tumor cell energy metabolism as demonstrated by down-regulation in lipid metabolism, glycolysis, krebs-tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. second, we show that loss of fas is anti-tumorigenic by up-regulating cell cycle arrest and death receptor mediated apoptosis pathways. third, the inhibition of fas leads to changes in genes that regulate transcription and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. altogether, these findings provide novel insight into the cellular processes affected by knockdown of fas in tumor cells.

a vital assumption in sirna-mediated gene silencing is that knockdown of the target gene is exclusive, and without off-target consequences. yet, increasing evidence has suggested sirna can induce off-target effects that are unique to the individual sirna duplex, but unrelated to the identity of the target gene  <cit> . these sirna duplex specific off-target effects are thought to arise from unintended sequence homology with the off-target transcript. in this study, we addressed the concern of potential sirna off-target effects by examining gene expression signatures in response to four sirna duplexes targeting different regions of the fas gene and focused our analysis on the common gene changes that were associated with knockdown of the enzyme. this eliminated off-target effects and enabled us to study gene changes specifically associated with knockdown of fas. altogether, evidence supporting the role of fas inhibition in inducing the described genomic effects is as follows: first, we showed that fas sirna strongly abrogates the expression of the fas gene, reduces fas protein levels and blocks the biosynthetic activity of the enzyme, as indicated by reduced malonyl-coa incorporation into palmitate. second, pathway analysis demonstrated that fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism are among the most significant pathways down-regulated in response to fas sirna. third, up-regulation of the p <dig> and rb gene pathways is consistent with our prior work showing knockdown of fas elicits a g1/s arrest through these pathways  <cit> . we also found increased expression of the p21cip <dig> gene which is up-regulated at the protein level in response to knockdown of fas  <cit> . like p <dig>  p21cip <dig> acts as a negative regulator of the g1/s transition by inactivating the cyclin-dependent kinases that function to phosphorylate rb and promote s phase entry  <cit> .

knockdown of fas by sirna or the small molecule inhibitor orlistat induces apoptosis by activating caspase  <dig> . this is consistent with the current observation that sirna targeting fas up-regulates tnf-Î± and trail death receptor mediated apoptosis pathways. in addition to trail, cell death through fas inhibition has also been linked to up-regulation of bnip <dig> and dap kinase  <dig>  <cit> . these two proapoptotic genes were detected by microarray analysis  <dig> h after fas inhibition, which explains why we did not observe similar changes as our study was limited to  <dig> h. a possible mechanism accounting for the ability of fas inhibition to induce these apoptotic effects is the accumulation of ceramide, which has been shown to induce these death receptor pathways  <cit> . ceramide accumulation is the result of malonyl-coa build-up following inhibition of fas  <cit> . importantly, we have found that knockdown of fas up-regulates sgpl <dig>  ceramide generation and promotion of cellular apoptosis have been observed in response to increased expression of sgpl <dig>  <cit> , suggesting this enzyme may represent a leverage point by which knockdown of fas influences ceramide production.

in addition to changes in proliferation and survival, knockdown of fas also suppresses genes in the glycolysis, krebs-tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways suggesting an overall reduction in cellular energy metabolism. consistent with the down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression, chajÃ¨s et al.  <cit>  report impaired mitochondrial function and generation of reactive oxygen species in response to fas inhibition. targeted inactivation of atp citrate lyase, a lipogenic enzyme which functions immediately up-stream fas, has the opposite effect by stimulating mitochondrial function  <cit> . this is interesting as we have found that knockdown of fas, but not of atp citrate lyase, induces apoptosis ; raising the question of whether the changes in cell survival and metabolism are linked together. indeed, growing evidence suggests tnf-Î± may influence metabolism, as it can induce the down-regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> , inhibition of electron transport chain activity  <cit>  and generation of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . identifying whether induction of apoptosis and reduced energy metabolism are connected  will be an important direction for future investigations, and may prove critical for understanding the anti-tumorigenic benefits of a knockdown in tumor fas.

the overall goal of our study was to define the regulatory changes that take place following inhibition of tumor fas. to this end, we have identified a number of target genes specifically modified by knockdown of fas. of particular interest among these are the dominant negative hlh transcription repressors id <dig> and id <dig>  which function to bind and inactivate the basic hlh family of transcription factors  <cit> , and therefore, are recognized for their ability to block cell differentiation and promote proliferation  <cit> . like fas, id over-expression correlates with tumor development in an array of cancers  <cit> , and knockdown of id2/id <dig> induces growth arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . our finding that knockdown of fas leads to the suppression of transcripts encoding id <dig> and id <dig> provides evidence of a link between fas and id expression. this link is further supported by observations that id2/id <dig> proteins can also suppress fas gene expression by inactivating the basic hlh transcription factor srebp <dig> c that controls fas expression  <cit> . further characterization of the molecular interplay between fas and id is needed to more fully understand the role of these in tumorigenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive database of genomic changes that occur in response to knockdown of fas and confirms that fas is central not only for tumor cell metabolism but also for tumor cell signaling. further characterization of these signals on the protein level will offer a more complete understanding of the cellular targets and pathways affected by knockdown of fas and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for tumor prevention and treatment.
