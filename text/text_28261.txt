BACKGROUND
the glaucomas are a common group of diseases sharing a characteristic pattern of retinal ganglion cell  degeneration and optic nerve head excavation  <cit> . increased intraocular pressure  is a significant predisposing risk factor for glaucoma, and all current glaucoma treatments aim to manipulate this trait  <cit> . pigment dispersion syndrome  is a common condition that results in the dispersion of iris pigment into the anterior chamber   <cit> . the dispersed pigment accumulates within the ocular drainage structures, resulting in iop elevation and glaucoma in some but not all individuals with pds  <cit> . the molecular events that underlie pds and that determine whether pigment dispersion leads to iop elevation and pigmentary glaucoma remain largely unknown. a promising approach for gaining insight into these complex processes is to use the mouse as an experimental system  <cit> . a benefit of this approach is that genetic and environmental factors can be significantly controlled and manipulated, thus making the biological complexity of a disease such as glaucoma easier to approach experimentally.

dba/2j  mice, and some related substrains, develop a form of glaucoma characterized by a pigment-dispersing iris disease that aberrantly deposits pigment throughout the ac, including the drainage structures of the eye. as a consequence, iop becomes elevated and glaucomatous rgc degeneration ensues  <cit> . the d <dig> iris disease is initiated by the combined interactions of the tyrp1b and gpnmbr150x mutations  <cit> . tyrp <dig> encodes a membrane-bound melanosomal protein with enzymatic activity involved in melanin synthesis  <cit> . relatively little is known about gpnmb function. the gpnmb protein has been detected in melanocytes  <cit> , dendritic cells  <cit> , and a small list of other cell types  <cit> . despite these findings, the cellular mechanisms by which tyrp <dig> and gpnmb contribute to the glaucoma remain largely unknown. furthermore, it is also unknown whether the gpnmb and tyrp <dig> mutations are sufficient to elicit the d <dig> form of glaucoma, or whether additional alleles are necessary during distinct stages of disease.

here, we report experiments utilizing an analysis of congenic strains of mice that further probe the genetic requirements contributing to the d <dig> form of glaucoma. the d2-derived tyrp1b and gpnmbr150x mutations were backcrossed into the widely used c57bl/6j  background. b <dig> double-congenic mice  were utilized in genetic epistasis experiments and compared with d <dig> with respect to clinical indices of iris disease, iop elevation, and optic nerve damage. similar to d <dig> mice, b <dig> double-congenic mice develop a severe depigmenting iris disease leading to massive pigment dispersion and aberrant pigment deposition on ac tissues. in comparison to d <dig>  the b <dig> double-congenic mice are much less likely to develop increased iop in response to this pigment dispersing disease. these results indicate that initiation  and progression  of glaucomatous phenotypes in d <dig> mice are genetically separable and that additional d2-derived hereditary factors relevant to glaucoma remain to be characterized. identification of these factors in mice may promote understanding of factors contributing to human glaucoma and suggest improved strategies for preventing glaucoma progression.

RESULTS
generation of b <dig> congenic strains containing the tyrp1b and gpnmbr150x mutations
in order to further probe the genetic requirements contributing to the d <dig> form of glaucoma, we created congenic strains of mice on the b <dig> genetic background. our approach for transferring the d2-derived tyrp1band gpnmbr150x mutations to the b <dig> background was to first create separate congenic strains for each of the respective chromosomal regions . successive rounds of backcrossing utilizing markers flanking tyrp <dig>  and gpnmb  yielded the single-congenic strains for tyrp1b  and gpnmbr150x . the final sizes of the n <dig> congenic intervals were determined to be 14– <dig> cm  for b <dig>  tyrp1b and 9– <dig> cm  for b <dig>  gpnmbr150x. after each single n <dig> congenic strain was established, mice were intercrossed to generate a double-congenic stock homozygous for both congenic intervals .

b <dig> background is permissive to tyrp1b and gpnmbr150x mediated iris disease
cohorts of n <dig> mice of all three genotypes  were aged and assayed for relevant phenotypes. as expected, congenic mice homozygous for the tyrp1bmutation had brown coat colors  <cit> , whereas the gpnmbr150x mutation had no effect on coat color in any of the stocks examined. clinical analysis of iris phenotypes in aged cohorts of the single-congenic b <dig> tyrp1b , single-congenic b <dig> gpnmbr150x , and double-congenic b <dig> tyrp1b gpnmbr150x  strains of mice indicated that the b <dig> background was permissive to the iris disease. iris phenotypes of the single-congenic strains closely resembled our previous observations of mice mutant for only gpnmb or tyrp <dig> in varying genetic contexts  <cit> . furthermore, the timing and severity of pigment dispersing iris disease in the double-congenic b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice is essentially the same as in d <dig> mice mutant for the same tyrp <dig> and gpnmb alleles  <cit> .

pigmentary pathway contributes to tyrp <dig> and gpnmb mediated iris disease
we next took advantage of the b <dig> background to perform strain controlled genetic epistasis experiments that tested mechanisms contributing to the tyrp <dig> and gpnmb mediated iris disease. a significant result in understanding the tyrp <dig> and gpnmb mediated iris disease is that modulating pigment production with tyrosinase  and hypopigmentation mutations completely rescues iris atrophy and pigment dispersion  <cit> . these experiments strongly implicated melanosomal functions of tyrp <dig> and gpnmb in pathogenesis. however, they were not absolutely complete, since only the effect of hypopigmentation mutations and not tyr were assessed for gpnmb. this is important because hypopigmentation mutations often affect multiple types of organelles  <cit>  whereas tyr has no known function in any organelles other than melanosomes.

to assess the importance of pigmentary pathways on the b <dig> background, we used the tyrc-2j mutation that arose spontaneously in the b <dig> strain  <cit> . we generated multiple cohorts of homozygous, tyrc-2j albino mice that were also homozygous for both tyrp1b and gpnmbr150x , or also homozygous for only tyrp1b or gpnmbr150x . aged cohorts of these albino mice were compared with normally pigmented mice of matched genotypes. all mice homozygous for the tyrc-2j mutation had albino coats  and albino irides . importantly, the tyrc-2j mutation rescued all observable tyrp1b – and gpnmbr150x-associated iris phenotypes in double-congenic b <dig> tyrp1b gpnmbr150x mice  and single-congenic b <dig> tyrp1b  and b <dig> gpnmbr150x mice . these results convincingly indicate that melanin production is a necessary component of the pathological events initiating iris disease on a b <dig> background, and they confirm a melanosomal component for both the tyrp <dig> and gpnmb mutant phenotypes.

b <dig>  tyrp1b and gpnmbr150x mice are less susceptible to iop elevation than d <dig> mice
having established that b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice exhibit a pigment-dispersing iris disease that is clinically, and mechanistically, similar to that in d <dig> mice, we next tested whether the b <dig> genetic background would influence the impact of this insult on iop. although the timing and severity of iris disease was similar, iop elevation was significantly muted in b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice compared with d <dig> mice . we compared the iop distributions of these strains in relation to iop values of  <dig> mmhg and  <dig> mmhg. as a strain, young d <dig> mice have lower iop than young b <dig> mice and  <dig> mmhg is >  <dig> sd above the mean of young pre-glaucomatous d <dig> mice. the value of  <dig> mmhg is glaucoma relevant, as individuals with an iop of  <dig> mmhg are commonly regarded as glaucoma suspect  <cit> . strikingly, a far smaller proportion of b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice were detected with iop >  <dig> mmhg compared with d <dig> mice . for example, at 7– <dig> months only  <dig> % of b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice had iop >  <dig> mmhg, compared with  <dig> % of d <dig> mice . similarly, at 9– <dig> months, only 11% of b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x had iops > <dig> mmhg, compared with  <dig> % of d <dig> . the same trend was observed considering all mice, irrespective of age . further demonstrating their lower susceptibility to developing high iop, pressure elevation was delayed in b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice compared with d <dig> mice . whereas the greatest proportion of d <dig> mice had iop >  <dig> mmhg  at 9– <dig> months, the greatest proportion of b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice  had iop >  <dig>  <dig> months later at 13– <dig> months of age . therefore, as a population, b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x mice are less susceptible to iop elevation than d <dig> mice.

b <dig>  tyrp1b and gpnmbr150x mice do not develop glaucomatous nerve damage
the relatively low susceptibility of b <dig> tyrp1b gpnmbr150x mice to iop elevation suggested that this strain may experience less glaucomatous nerve damage than d <dig> mice. in d <dig> mice, severe glaucomatous damage with substantial axon loss is detectable in over 50% of 11-month-old, 70% of 13-month-old and 80% of 19-month-old mice  <cit> . in contrast, severe damage was almost never detected in b <dig> tyrp1b gpnmbr150x mice . at ages when 50–80% of d <dig> mice have severe damage, only one of  <dig> b <dig> tyrp1bgpnmbr150x nerves was severely affected . the distributions of nerve-damage level were almost identical in b <dig> tyrp1b gpnmbr150x and wild-type b <dig> mice , indicating that the degree of damage in b <dig> tyrp1b gpnmbr150x mice represents standard aging changes for this strain background. to maximize the likelihood of detecting glaucoma, optic nerves from the mice with the highest iops were examined , but none had a level of damage similar to the glaucomatous damage of d <dig> mice. additionally, no significant difference in the number of healthy axons was detected between normal b <dig> and b <dig> tyrp1isa gpnmbr150x mice aged either 4– <dig> or 22– <dig> months . combined, the analysis of optic nerves from these cohorts of b <dig> tyrp1isa gpnmbr150x mice convincingly shows that on the b <dig> genetic background, the tyrp- <dig> and gpnmb-mediated iris disease does not result in glaucoma.

discussion
on a d <dig> background, mutations in tyrp <dig> and gpnmb underlie a form of pigmentary glaucoma involving a pigment-dispersing iris disease, increased iop, and optic-nerve disease  <cit> . here, we report transfer of the d2-derived tyrp1band gpnmbr150x mutations to the b <dig> genetic background to produce a b <dig> double-congenic strain that develops the iris disease. surprisingly, the b <dig> double-congenic mice were less susceptible to iop elevation than d <dig> mice and did not develop glaucomatous nerve damage. these strains provide a powerful resource for studying the functions of tyrp <dig> and gpnmb, dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which pigment dispersion leads to iop elevation, and identifying additional genes contributing to the d <dig> form of glaucoma. furthermore, congenic strains are broadly useful resources, and these strains will likely have additional benefit to the broader mouse-genetics community  <cit> .

melanosomal processes contribute to both gpnmb and tyrp <dig> phenotypes
the current experiments demonstrate that melanosomal defects associated with melanin synthesis play a key role in the initiation of both tyrp- <dig> and gpnmb-mediated iris disease. melanosomal synthesis of melanin involves a series of reactions creating the biopolymer melanin from the precursor tyrosine  <cit> . many of the indole-quinone intermediates of these reactions are cytotoxic, and the mechanisms regulating their cytotoxicity are only partially understood  <cit> . our results indicate that mutations in tyrp <dig> and gpnmb act in the melanosome, where they promote cytotoxicity in a manner that can be rescued by halting production of these toxic intermediates. based on these findings, it will be important to examine other genes encoding melanosomal proteins that may participate in these events and that may also cause similar diseases of the iris.

genetic background affects susceptibility to iop elevation and subsequent glaucoma
the experiments described above demonstrate that the severity and timing of the pigment-dispersing iris disease of b <dig> double-congenic mice is essentially the same as that of d <dig> mice. this suggests that the dispersed pigment and iris debris similarly insult the ocular drainage structures of both strains. nevertheless, the b <dig> double-congenic mice were much less susceptible to iop elevation than d <dig> mice. probably because of their resistance to iop elevation, the b <dig> double-congenics were not found to develop glaucoma. in fact, the degree of optic-nerve damage observed was largely similar to age-matched wild-type b <dig>  indicating that the small degree of optic neuropathy observed was likely an independent phenomenon, such as the result of the normal aging process or a low-penetrance developmental abnormality. experiments to understand this strain difference in iop elevation are underway.

these experiments also suggest that the cytotoxicity mediated by tyrp <dig> and gpnmb does not kill the rgcs, and that iris disease and rgc death can be dissociated from each other. therefore, rgc death in d <dig> mice appears to be a pressure-dependent process resembling the pathology of human glaucoma. in support of this, rgc death in this model is not uniformly distributed  <cit> , as would be expected if damaged by an iris-derived diffusible toxin. rather, it appears that rgcs are uniquely susceptible retinal neurons, and the pattern of damage is consistent with an insult to rgc axons in the optic nerve  <cit> .

genetics and human pds
the broader implications of the strain-specific phenotypes may be important for studies of the heredity and mechanism of human pigmentary glaucoma. in humans, pds/pg exhibits strong hereditary associations  <cit> . a few families with clear inheritance of pds are reported. however, the low incidence of pds in family members of the majority of affected individuals suggests a more complex etiology, possibly influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. in some families, linkage was initially reported between the disease phenotype and markers on 7q35-q <dig>  <cit> . however, causative mutations at this locus have thus far not been found. analysis of candidate genes suggested by experiments with d <dig> mice  have also failed to identify any clear mutations in these families  <cit> . thus, the disease in these families may be more complex than initially suspected. the lack of identified mutations in gpnmb and tyrp <dig> in these families does not preclude the involvement of these genes  in patients of other families or in the more common, more complex cases. it remains to be determined whether pds/pg in other patient populations is caused by more tractable loci, or whether the identification of genes associated with human pds/pg may simply necessitate approaches that can overcome genetic complexity.

genetic context and human glaucoma
from a mechanistic view, the dichotomy between the differing responses of the b <dig> double-congenics versus d <dig> mice is analogous to the differing responses of people with pds. many human eyes tolerate significant amounts of dispersed pigment without developing glaucoma  <cit> . indeed, fewer than half of human eyes with pigment dispersion progress to pigmentary glaucoma  <cit> . this, along with the expected minor degree of aqueous humor outflow obstruction due to pigment itself  <cit> , suggests that individual differences in the ocular reaction to dispersed pigment are important in determining whether pigment dispersion progresses to pigmentary glaucoma. the d <dig> and b <dig> congenic strains provide a tractable resource for mechanistically deciphering the ocular reactions that determine whether iop becomes harmfully elevated after the drainage structures are insulted by dispersed pigment and iris debris. future studies of these reactions will not only improve our mechanistic understanding of the disease, but may also suggest new classes of genes worthy of analysis among human pds/pg patients.

experimental implications of strain specific effects
our results highlight the profound importance of genetic background to complex diseases such as glaucoma. in addition to understanding human glaucoma, it is important to consider effects of genetic background when using animal models. as a genetic resource, these congenic mouse strains will help to address this issue. until now, a strain-matched control for tyrp <dig> – and gpnmb-mediated disease has been problematic. for instance, although any standard inbred mouse strain that does not develop glaucoma can be utilized as a control for d <dig> mice, this experimental design does not distinguish whether any observed differences relate to the disease state of the eye, or are merely previously unappreciated strain-dependent background effects. given the complexity of these glaucoma phenotypes, experiments comparing between different strain backgrounds or using segregating backgrounds can be misleading  <cit> . importantly, the congenic mice generated here can be utilized with strain-matched normal b <dig> mice to perform appropriately controlled experiments.

pressure-independent rgc death in c57bl/ <dig> mice
pressure-independent rgc death has been reported in c57bl/ <dig> mice and may depend on environment or substrain used. in wild-type c57bl/ <dig> mice from the supplier harlan , an age-related reduction in the number of rgcs has been described  <cit> . by  <dig> months, the number of rgcs was reduced to approximately 46% that of young mice. in our current study, this age-related decline was absent in both the double-congenic b <dig> tyrp1b gpnmbr150x mice and normal b <dig> controls that all had a c57bl/6j background. similarly, we did not detect glaucomatous rgc loss in another experiment where c57bl/6j mice were also aged to 19+ months  <cit> . this difference in rgc death between studies may be explained by potential environmental influences, differences in analysis protocols, or genetic differences in the substrain utilized.

CONCLUSIONS
this work introduces b <dig> congenic strains that allow highly controlled experiments when studying glaucoma resulting from the tyrp1band gpnmbr150x alleles. using this resource, we uncovered a striking strain dependence of developing high iop and glaucoma when challenged by a profound pigment-dispersing iris disease. in future experiments, it will be particularly important to identify the pathways and genes influencing iop elevation in this setting.
