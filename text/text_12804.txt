BACKGROUND
skin is a multi-layered tissue that is composed of continuously renewing epidermis – with keratinocytes  as a predominant cell type – and underlying dermis populated mostly by fibroblasts. the life span of epidermal keratinocytes is controlled by two alternative pathways: differentiation as their normal function or activation as an altered function in wound healing or skin diseases  <cit> . epidermal kcs residing in the basal layer of the epidermis differentiate through multiple layers and finally shed as cornified dead cells from the skin surface  <cit> .

the relatively noninvasive sampling together with the methods that allow culturing of pure kcs have greatly facilitated research on skin and kcs. in cell culture, kcs are uncoupled from their tissue environment that naturally provides a network of homeostatic control signals; they are induced to either retain an active proliferative state or to differentiate. however, the prolonged kc culturing leads to the induction of cellular senescence  <cit>  and therefore not only primary kcs but also immortalized kc lines, such as hacat   <cit> , have been widely studied to understand various normal and altered functions of the skin. hacat cells represent a highly popular model system since despite some uv-inducible mutations in tp <dig> alleles  <cit>  they are non-tumorigenic and have retained their capacity to differentiate  <cit> . the comparability of each of the models to intact skin has often been questioned. in the current study, we address the question of how representative models cultured kcs and hacats are for studying human epidermis.

genome-wide expression profiling is an useful approach to screen key genes with respect to different cellular statuses and to further model the regulatory networks  <cit> . microarray technology provides a traditional profiling method to measure thousands of known genes simultaneously, but it has recently been replaced by rna-seq technology that has proven to give more detailed insights into transcriptome. both technologies have been previously applied to study the gene expression in skin . however, an important fact has been largely omitted: when kcs undergo their complex lifecycle, they change not only cell size and cell cycle kinetics, but also the actively transcribed rna content, with the largest rna content in fresh, actively growing cultured kcs  <cit> . in microarray, rna-seq and even qrt-pcr, the same amount of total rna is loaded for each sample, although yields of the polya+ rnas purified from total rnas may differ. moreover, normalization for the differential expression test expects equivalent expression levels for several co-expressed genes  <cit> . therefore, the genome-wide expression profiling in the previous studies might have underestimated the complexity of the kc transcriptome during their lifecycle.

in this study, we revisit the skin and kc transcriptome with respect to fluctuation of polya+ rna content by the keratinocyte statuses; differentiated, activated, senescent and immortalized. four types of human keratinocyte samples represented these cell statuses: epidermal tissue , cultured primary kcs in early and late passages, and hacat cell line. to reduce the sample size and sequencing costs and to control the fluctuation of mrna concentration, we applied single-cell tagged reverse transcription  sequencing method for expression profiling using 10 ng of total rna per sample which is ten times less than required for a conventional rna-seq method  <cit> . for accurate expression profiling and statistical tests, we employed strt rna-seq with synthetic polya+ spike-in rna  <cit> , and samstrt statistical package with spike-in based normalization  <cit> . we first evaluated the improvements of our approach on the genome-wide expression profiling and confirmed the accuracy of the improved methods by literature survey of the keratin and collagen genes. then we extracted genes that correlated with the sample types, and genes contributing to the sample classification, especially transcription factors  <cit>  and long noncoding rnas  <cit> , as candidate regulators for keratinocyte characters. these results provide new insights into the skin transcriptome and into the usefulness of primary kcs and hacats as model systems.

RESULTS
sample preparation, strt rnaseq, and quality control
the protocol for sample preparation is depicted in fig.  <dig>  we collected sg biopsies with minimal inclusion of dermis and full thickness skin biopsies for kc culture from  <dig> donors undergoing plastic surgery . the sg samples were used directly for total rna extraction whereas the full-thickness biopsies were used to set up kc cultures from which total rna was extracted at early  and late  passages. after rna quality control ,  <dig> samples were used to prepare two strt libraries using  <dig> technical replicates, each containing 10 ng total rna . each strt library was sequenced on four lanes of illumina hiseq  <dig> instrument. in average, there were  <dig>  million strt reads and  <dig>  million mapped reads per replica. after alignment to the human genome and gene-based quantitation, we confirmed consistency between all technical replicates . one sample  exhibited exceptionally high relative polya+ transcript counts , and displayed unexpected overexpression of some abundantly expressed genes . therefore, we excluded it from further consideration as an outlier potentially biasing further analyses.fig.  <dig> sample collection. a split-thickness skin graft  samples were harvested in the operating room using a dermatome. lower panel shows a haematoxylin-eosin stained section of sg sample demonstrating minimal dermis involvement . b full thickness biopsy samples were collected as 3 mm punch biopsies. red dotted line in the schematic drawing of skin  demonstrates sampling depth for sg samples  and punch biopsy samples . keratinocyte  cultures were established from punch biopsy samples after enzymatic dissociation, and isolated primary kc were cultured to the passage  <dig>  and to the passage 5/ <dig> . c the spontaneously immortalized model keratinocyte cell line, hacat, was used as a cell line model. total rna was isolated from each sample as outlined in materials and methods



varying polya+ rna content in 10 ng total rna
a common assumption is that cells to be compared contain equal amounts of rna. however, kcs have been shown to change their rna content over time in long-term culture  <cit> , leading us to further investigate the differences in polya+ rna contents in our samples. we found that the estimated polya+ rna contents as quantified against the added spike-in rna controls varied in different sample types . the variation was larger than the variation of the repeatedly measured total rna amounts that were loaded for sequencing . such differences can lead to the misinterpretation of differential expression when traditional endogenous gene-based normalization is applied. this is demonstrated in fig. 2b, which is a comparison of 10k donor samples between sg and ekcs. the endogenous gene-based normalization method did not estimate the spike-in levels equivalently although the amount of spike-in rnas were equal in all samples. because the normalized spike-in levels must be same in the comparison, we employed the recently developed normalization method, samstrt  <cit> , which uses exclusively the spike-in rnas for normalization . validation assays by qrt-pcr confirmed the upregulation of two housekeeping genes, rplp <dig> and rpl13a, as predicted by the spike-in-based normalization, both of which were predicted unchanged or downregulated by the gene-based normalization . moreover, the spike-in-based normalization method provided more consistent expression patterns in multiple samples with the qrt-pcr measurements . in conclusion, the observed variation in the polya+ rna content in 10 ng total rna led to a misinterpretation of the expression pattern by the gene-based normalization method, but it became more reliable by the spike-in based normalization.fig.  <dig> amounts of polya+ rna in cells and effect of normalization. a relative human polya+ rna amounts in samples were estimated by relating the human-specific sequence counts to the spike-in sequence counts. the amounts polya+ rna detected were ekc>lkc=hacat>sg. the ekc samples contained approximately twice as much polya+ rna as the sg samples. the samples contained equal concentrations of cellular rna. b comparison of gene expression between sg and ekcs of donor 10k by applying the gene-based normalization as implemented in samseq. gene expression levels are shown as light gray dots , levels of spike-in rnas as asterisks, and three control genes with distinct symbols. the spike-in rnas appear twofold downregulated, although all samples contained equal amounts of spike-in rnas. with the gene-based normalization, the q-q plot  shows approximately similar numbers of up- and down-regulated genes, shown as deviations from the diagonal. c the same comparison of gene expression between sg and ekcs by applying spike-in normalization as implemented in samstrt . spike-in rna counts follow the diagonal, but many more polya+ rnas appear upregulated than downregulated as shown by the upward shift of the gray cloud compared to . q-q plot  shows many more upregulated than downregulated genes, consistent with the increase of relative polya+ rna amount as shown in . d to experimentally validate which normalization yields a more correct analysis, qrt-pcr assays were performed on selected genes. delta-ct values indicate no change in spike-in rna, approximately twofold upregulated rpl13a and rplp <dig>  and 8-fold upregulated gapdh, consistent with the spike-in-normalized results. e gene expression profiles for three sample types  are similar between samstrt-normalized and rt-pcr results, whereas the samseq-normalized profiles show mild u shapes for rpl13a and rplp <dig>  different from the unchanged levels by rt-pcr and samstrt



characterization of sgs, cultured kcs, and hacats by differentially expressed genes
when we assessed the transcriptome profiles in the different samples, we found  <dig>  differentially expressed genes . among them,  <dig> out of  <dig> cytokeratin genes were differentially expressed , and many of them well known markers for the kc differentiation status both in cell culture and in tissue  <cit> . hierarchical clustering confirmed significant contrasts between three sample types: sg, cultured kc and hacat. sgs contained several cytokeratin transcripts corresponding to cells at differentiated or differentiating epidermal layers , whereas the kcs contained cytokeratins typical of cells that maintain their proliferative capacity  or that are activated by wound healing, hyperproliferative skin diseases or in vitro culturing   <cit> . krt <dig> and krt <dig> that are the developmentally first keratins absent from normal skin and rather characterizing simple epithelia are in our data expressed by both cultured kcs and hacats supporting their proliferative and undifferentiated nature  <cit> .fig.  <dig> differential expression between the sgs, cultured kcs and hacats. a the heat map panel to the left shows the expression of cytokeratins in different samples. annotations for cytokeratins in the panel to the right for the gene expression on different layers and tissue types  are based on takahashi et al.  <cit> , for the status in activation cycle  are based on freedberg et al.  <cit> , and for the protein expression in five cell types  are based on human protein atlas, hpa  <cit> . according to hpa, white denotes no data, gray means not detected  or with negative intensity , and red represents varying protein levels according to the intensity of the colour. sg, split-thickness skin graft; ekc, early passage keratinocyte; lkc, late passage keratinocyte; hctp, hacat. b the heat map shows the expression of collagens in different samples



there were no significant differences between the early  and late  passage kcs in the cytokeratin levels. in contrast, hacat was remarkably different from both sgs, ekc and lkc expressing higher levels of cytokeratins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . furthermore, several cytokeratins  characterising hacat by the spike-in normalization  were consistent with published protein expression patterns, low expression in skin, but high in hacat  <cit> . this observation was only partially supported by the gene-based normalization  – by that method krt <dig> and  <dig> did not reach significant difference, suggesting that the gene-based normalization was less sensitive or less accurate than the spike-in normalization.

to further confirm the sample classification by strt results, we compared the sample specific expression of different collagen genes , which have previously characterized expression profiles in different types of tissues  <cit> .  <dig> out of  <dig> collagen genes were differentially expressed. sgs expressed mainly connective tissue specific collagens , consistent with the presense of thin connective tissue layer underlying the epidermis, whereas cultured cells were characterized by the basement membrane  and skin hemidesmosome  specific collagens again supporting the proliferative nature typical for the kcs in basal layer of epidermis.

characterization of sgs, ekcs, lkcs, and hacats by coregulated genes
we approached the question how comparable cultured cells are as model systems for intact skin by elucidating the gene expression differences between the samples. we applied principal component analysis  to decompose the differences into several dimensions and to simplify the complexity of our dataset. pca enabled multiclass comparisons between samples and improved the interpretation of expression profiles. the first principal componene , that depicts the largest variation between samples, classified the sgs as a separate group compared to the other samples. the second and third pcs separated the early and late passages of kcs from hacats, respectively. in the following paragraphs, we interpret the meaning of each pc axis with literature surveys to assess appropriateness of the sample classifications based on our expression profile, and to decode insights into the differentiation and the growth control.fig.  <dig> sample classification by the principal component analysis. pca scatter plots using the spike-in normalized gene expression profiles. pc <dig> demonstrates the contrast between sgs and other sample types, pc <dig> depicts the contrast between ekcs and hacats, and pc <dig> shows the contrast between hacats and lkcs. percentages beside of the axis labels are the contribution ratios. identical symbols between sgs and kcs denote identical donors in three technical replicas each. sg, split-thickness skin graft; ekc, early passage keratinocyte; lkc, late passage keratinocyte



pc <dig> demonstrates the contrast between sgs and other sample types
first, we extracted genes correlating with the pc <dig>  in this component, positively correlated genes referred to those with higher expression in the sgs when compared to kcs or hacats, and negatively correlated genes acting oppositely. our data showed that  <dig>  genes correlated positively with the pc <dig> and thus were expressed higher in sgs , although the total polya+ content of sgs was lower than that of kcs and hacats. in contrast,  <dig>  genes correlated negatively . nine out of ten most upregulated genes in the sgs were previously associated with epidermal differentiation or with small organelles in differentiating cells , and five of ten most upregulated genes in kcs and hacats were annotated as localized in mitochondria , which are lost from keratinocytes during epidermal differentiation  <cit> . to conclude, the most correlated known genes contributing to pc <dig> were thus consistent with the biological phenotype of the contrasted cell types.table  <dig> ten most correlated genes with pc <dig>  tables a and b are subsets of significantly correlated genes with relevant functions in skin lineage . a positively correlated genes, which were upregulated in sgs, and  negatively correlated genes, which were upregulated in kcs and hacats



to further interpret the pc <dig> and to find the associations between genes and phenotypes contrasted on pc, we performed gene set enrichment analysis amongst all genes that correlated with that pc . our results showed that  <dig> out of  <dig>  gene sets correlated positively, being upregulated in the sgs . the most significant gene set  was target genes of p <dig> and p <dig>  which are known mediators of keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> . similarly,  <dig>  gene sets showed negative correlation . the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th, and 10th of significant gene sets  were related to mitochondria. therefore, the pc-gsea extracted meaningful contrasts of the biological functions and the phenotypes to interpret the pc <dig> table  <dig> ten most significant gene sets enriched in pc <dig> correlating genes. tables a and b are subsets of gene sets that were significantly  enriched in pc <dig> correlating genes by pc-gsea .  gene sets in positively correlated genes, which were upregulated in sgs, and  gene sets in negatively correlated genes, which were upregulated in kcs and hacats. size is number of genes belonging the gene set. nes is normalized enrichment score



since the pc scores representing the functions and phenotypes were calculated by linear combination of the expression profile and the loading coefficients, genes with large loading coefficients on each pc would be the key regulators for the functional contrast. for example, in case of pc <dig>  genes with high positive loading coefficients contribute to the characteristic phenotypes and functions of sgs, and conversely, genes with high negative loading coefficients contribute to common characteristic phenotypes and functions of hacats and kcs. when we extracted genes contributing to pc <dig>   <dig> genes showed positive loading and  <dig> genes showed negative loading .  <dig> of the  <dig> positively contributing genes that explain the functions in sgs, and one of the  <dig> negative ones, characterizing the cultured cells, were known transcription factors . six of the  <dig> transcription factors upregulated in sgs were known regulators for skin maturation and differentiation phenotypes . as an example, pou2f <dig>  is a known transactivator of the suprabasal layer marker krt <dig>  <cit> , which correlated positively with pc <dig> , and is also a known repressor for the basal layer marker krt <dig>  <cit> , which correlated negatively with pc <dig> . to conclude, differentiation and the mitochondrial phenotypes are possible interpretations of the pc <dig> and can be explained by the fluctuation of transcription factors that were clearly associated to sample types.fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of expression profiles of high loading loci contributing to the sample classification for pc <dig>  pc <dig> and pc <dig>  panel  shows transcription factors  in the high loading features, and panel  known noncoding genes. the expression of different tfs separates sgs, kcs and hacats from each other whereas the expression of noncoding genes mainly separates hacats from other samples. the contribution to the three first pcs is shown to the right red denoting positively contributing genes and green denoting negatively contributing genes. sg, split-thickness skin graft; ekc, early passage keratinocyte; lkc, late passage keratinocyte; hctp, hacat



pc <dig> depicts the contrast between ekcs and hacats
pc <dig> captured the second largest variation which mostly shows the contrast between hacats and ekcs, with intermediate lkcs . three thousand nine hundred sixty nine genes correlated positively with pc <dig> and were thus expressed at higher level in ekcs , and six of the top  <dig> positively correlated genes were polya+ rna binding proteins . in contrast, there were no negatively correlated genes that would appear upregulated in hacat, which may depend on the fact that hacats and lkcs had less polya+ rna than ekcs . accordingly, pc-gsea towards pc <dig> revealed  <dig> positively correlating and only two negatively correlating gene sets . when we investigated associations in the correlating genes and the gene sets as an interpretation of pc <dig>  we found that the pc <dig> explained the difference of g1/s-transition between the ekcs and hacats both through negative and positive correlation. first, the genes that bear h3k27me <dig> in es cells and have high-cpg-density promoter, showed negative correlation   <cit> ; the genes with h3k27me <dig> marks have actually been shown to be transcribed at g1/s- and s-phases in hacats. second, target genes of rb <dig>  which is known to be negative regulator of the s-phase entry, showed positive correlation   <cit> .table  <dig> ten most positively correlated genes with pc <dig>  table is a subset of positively correlated genes with pc <dig>  and the thick mark indicates if the gene codes polya+ rna binding protein 



then we proceeded to find genes that are the key regulators for the functional contrast on pc <dig>   <dig> genes showed high positive loading to pc <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed negative loading . among them, five positive loading genes and nine negative ones were transcription factors . interestingly, the positive loading genes apbb <dig>  <cit> , espl <dig>  <cit> , tcf <dig>  <cit>  and znf <dig>  <cit>  were known cell cycle regulators or contributors to cell proliferation. moreover, one of the  <dig> positive loading genes and seven of the  <dig> negative ones were known lncrnas . uca <dig> was a negatively loading lncrna, known as essential for bladder cancer cell proliferation via creb-dependent pathway  <cit> . interestingly, cyclin d <dig> expression in kcs is also under the creb-dependent pathway  <cit> . in conclusion, the difference of g1/s-transition between hacats and ekcs is a possible interpretation for pc <dig>  and again the fluctuation of transcription factors was highly associated to sample types.

pc <dig> shows the contrast between hacats and lkcs
pc <dig> associated mostly with the variation between hacats and lkcs . we could not detect positively correlated genes  with pc <dig>  although these samples had equivalent polya+ rna contents . in contrast,  <dig>  correlated negatively refering to upregulation in hacat , and five of the top  <dig> negatively correlated genes codes polya+ rna binding protein . in pc-gsea, only  <dig> gene sets correlated positively with pc <dig>  whereas  <dig> correlated negatively . as the interpretation of pc <dig>  we found that it was associated with senescense, in accordance of kc senescence that does not apply to the continuously proliferating hacat cells. one explaining component was the positive correlation  of potassium channel genes . potassium channel activation inhibits proliferation by activating a senescence program in breast cancer  <cit> , and the g0/g1-arrest is accompanied by this activation. consistently, not only the genes for g <dig> and early g <dig> phases, but also the other cell cycle associated genes were downregulated in lkcs . furthermore, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> target genes were upregulated in hacats . those mirnas are functionally associated with p53-dependent cellular maintenance and aging .table  <dig> ten most negatively correlated genes with pc <dig>  table is a subset of negatively correlated genes with pc <dig>  and the thick mark indicates if the gene codes polya+ rna binding protein 



we next attempted to find supporting genes for this interpretation. a total of  <dig> genes showed high positive loading to pc <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed high negative loading . among them, six positive and  <dig> negative loading genes were transcription factors . one negatively loading  gene was rad <dig>  known to be involved in the homologous recombination and the repair of dna. expression of rad <dig> is regulated by lamin a   <cit> , and expression of the lmna was consistently negatively correlated . it’s well known that the mutations of lmna lead to hutchinson–gilford progeria syndrome characterized by a premature aging  <cit> . therefore, senescence and cellular aging responces would be a possible interpretation for pc <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
strt rna-seq method complemented with synthetic rnas revealed a variation of polya+ rna content per total rna in different cell types, sgs, ekcs, lkcs and hacats, reflecting the activity of the cell type. even though the strt reads are concentrated towards the 5’end of the polya+ transcripts and the method has limited resolution at 2nd and more downstream exons, the advantages of the method include the small amount of starting material needed for library preparation, early multiplexing of up to  <dig> samples reducing the cost and time of library preparation, and the inclusion of external spike-in rnas as a standard procedure. the spike-in normalization has been shown to be a valuable tool when comparing samples with fluctuating polya+ rna contents  <cit> . we showed that the use of spike-in-based normalization produced consistent results with qpcr validations, and provided us with deeper insights into kc biology. in contrary, the traditional gene-based normalization method led to inaccurate expression profiles. moreover, our approach would be applicable not only for the studies on kcs but also for the other studies with fluctuation of polya+ rna content, for example those on single cells with different types or sizes  <cit> .

we applied pca to elucidate dissimilarity between the samples, and also to decompose the differences. the three first pcs represented differentiation and the mitochondrial phenotypes between sgs and cultured cells, g1/s-transition between hacats and ekcs, and senescence and cellular aging responces between hacats and lkcs. all cultured cells differed from tissue samples and hacat cells differed remarkably from other cultured cells based on both pca and the comparison of previously known kc markers, cytokeratins. our results thus suggest that great caution should be payed when using cultured primary kcs and cell models like hacats as models for skin, especially when focusing on the pathways revealed by pca. the transcriptomes of cultured primary kcs and hacats resemble that of acivated skin rather than normal skin as shown also by others  <cit> .

in this study, we present an approach to compare highly varying cell types by applying synthetic rna based normalization. for further studies or applications of other biological events, the key is to find the hidden associations between genes and phenotypes which are contrasted on pcs. we also note that there are still many poorly annotated genes in the genome that might be revealed by our approach. moreover, pca without sample pre-classification might be applied in studying gene expression in complex disorders using a large enough cohort.
