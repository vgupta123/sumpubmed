BACKGROUND
narcolepsy is a sleep disorder found in several mammal species  <cit> . the human form of narcolepsy is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors and appear mostly in sporadic cases  <cit> . canine narcolepsy was first reported in the 1970's, and since then dogs have been extensively used for exploring the underlying mechanisms of the disease  <cit> . a colony of doberman pinschers with a heritable form of narcolepsy due to a mutation in a single major gene was established at stanford sleep research center in  <dig>  <cit> . the genetic transmission of the mutation, also known as canarc- <dig>  is autosomal recessive. homozygous individuals show several symptoms similar to the human form of narcolepsy including emotionally triggered cataplexy , short sleep latency and fragmented sleep  <cit> . linkage analysis and subsequent positional cloning experiments identified the canarc- <dig> to be hypocretin receptor  <dig>   <cit> . this finding was rapidly followed by findings in human narcolepsy where hypocretin ligand deficiency was found in most narcolepsy-cataplexy cases  <cit> . impairment in the hypocretin system is well established as the origin of the condition, but little is known about the downstream molecular alterations that may lead to the phenotypes related to narcolepsy. this knowledge will be essential to link the alterations in dogs with possible alterations in humans that lead to similar symptoms. to identify genes with expression affected by the mutated hypocretin receptor in dogs, we compared gene expression patterns in three parts of the brains using human microarrays containing  <dig> clones in a cross-species hybridization design previously shown successful  <cit> . we studied the expression pattern in brain tissue samples from hypothalamus, amygdala and pons of six narcoleptic doberman dogs compared to their six healthy heterozygous siblings. since all animals were raised in the same environmental conditions and have a very similar genetic background, our experiment offers a unique opportunity to identify molecular pathways that have been altered in narcolepsy in the absence of large environmental variables that modify mrna expression levels.

RESULTS
microarray analysis
to assess whether brain gene expression differed between narcoleptic and heterozygous dogs, we compared the relative mrna levels in pools of narcoleptic and heterozygous siblings in three regions of the brain, using eight cdna microarrays. of the total number of  <dig> cdna clones on the array,  <dig> gave a signal above background in amygdala, pons and hypothalamus, indicating that about 50% of the clones on the arrays cross-hybridized with mrna expressed in all three regions of the dog brain. the cdna clones were ranked after their likelihood of indicating an average mrna expression difference between the narcoleptic animals and the control group that was not due to random technical variation . twenty-two cdna clones, with a penalized f-ratio larger than  <dig>  showed consistent average expression differences between the groups, although the differences were small for several hybridizations . of these  <dig> selected clones, we expected five false positives  to occur by chance according to our permutation analysis. since the microarray screening was associated with a relatively large proportion of expected false positives , and due to that fact that inter-individual variation in mrna levels was not taken into account because of the pooling procedure used, the results from the microarrays are only suggestive. consequently, these results were confirmed by an independent method at the individual level as described below. the microarray data  is available through arrayexpress.

real-time rt-pcr
from the microarray list , we selected genes for qpcr verification with evidence of a transcriptional change larger or equal to  <dig>  fold in at least one of the examined regions. the rational for focusing on relatively large effects was that the technical variation associated with qpcr makes it difficult to verify true expression differences of limited magnitude, and we also reasoned that the biological significance of any findings would be related to the magnitude of the disturbance. for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that fulfilled the selection criteria  we were able to design qpcr primers for an orthologous gene in dog. for the remaining two genes, no corresponding sequence was available in the dog est databases, and it was therefore not possible to design dog primers. since the dog genome has been sequenced but not yet fully annotated, several mrna sequences are only predicted annotations to known genes in other species. however, all primers were designed to amplify a gene-specific mrna sequence from dog, and according to blast searches with the dog primer sequences, no cross-amplification of other members of the same gene families should be possible.

for each individual animal, mrna levels for the corresponding dog est's were quantified in the three brain regions. the mean mrna levels of three genes, proenkephalin , tachykinin precursor  <dig>  and suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  were lower in the brains of narcoleptic dogs than in their heterozygous siblings  . as shown in the figure, the effect was most pronounced in the amygdala. this was also evident from the analysis, indicated by a significant interaction between brain region and disease status for two of the genes . in the amygdala, the mrna levels of penk was  <dig>  fold lower in narcoleptic dogs than in heterozygous siblings, whereas tac <dig> and socs <dig> showed a  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold decrease in expression respectively. thus, we were able to confirm expression differences of three of the eight selected genes. for the remaining five, they may have represented false positive results from the arrays. alternatively, we may not have selected the correct orthologous gene in dogs, which may be particularly likely for clones that were not properly annotated  or belong to large gene families .

discussion
we have compared brain gene expression between narcoleptic dogs and their healthy heterozygous siblings and identified three genes, tac <dig>  penk and socs <dig>  with a down-regulated expression profile, especially pronounced in amygdala and pons, in the brain of narcoleptic dogs. we used cross-species hybridizations of pools of dog mrna to human microarrays. cross-species hybridizations can be very useful when well annotated and validated microarrays are available in other species, such as humans, or when the genome of the species under study is poorly known  <cit> , and the method is sufficiently sensitive for identification of some genes with large expression differences  <cit> . the investigated regions of the brain, hypothalamus, amygdala and pons, were examined because the hypocretin containing neurons are located in lateral hypothalamus, from where they project to several areas of the brain  <cit> . two of these projection areas selected are the amygdala and pons, since several investigators suggested that these structures play important roles for the regulation of rem sleep and induction of cataplexy in narcoleptic dogs  <cit> .

a limitation of this study may be that all dogs have been exposed to drug challenges, as explained in the methods section. this was done in the context of a linkage study to confirm phenotypic status in backcross animals . we believe it is unlikely that drug history is responsible for the observed expressional differences between narcoleptics and heterozygotes. both groups of animals were treated in parallel with the exact same drugs at the same doses and in the same sequence. furthermore, drug doses used were typically very low, exposure was equal for all animals and rather limited in time, as a recovery of  <dig> months without drugs was allowed.

for the initial scan we used cross-species hybridizations of dog mrna to human microarrays. in previous work, we have repeatedly used this approach to successfully identify genes that are differentially expressed in canids  <cit>  as dog and human transcripts have a relatively high sequence homology, estimated to about 88%  <cit> . however, cross-species hybridization may have limited sensitivity due to less stringent hybridization conditions, and the method will bias the detection of expression differences towards abundant mrna species with a conserved sequence. it is thus possible that small alteration in the activity of many genes down-stream of the hypocretin receptor mutation were over-looked in our microarray screening. on the other hand, it is possible that the altered activity of a few key genes such as penk, tac <dig> and socs <dig> is crucial for the development of the disease.

tac <dig> encodes four products of the tachykinin peptide family: substance p, substance k, neurokinin a and neuropeptide gamma  <cit> . the tachykinins interact with g-protein coupled receptors and mediate biological functions such as smooth muscle contraction, neuronal excitation and pain transmission. substance p is of special interest, since it has shown to initiate and maintain rem sleep in the reticular formation of the pons, and increase paradoxical sleep  latency and promote wakefulness  <cit> . it has also been shown that substance p containing neurons project from the nuclei of the brainstem to the amygdala  <cit> . a decrease expression of tac <dig> could therefore, at least in pons, be responsible for a decrease in substance p and a reduction of wakefulness and an increase in rem sleep propensity.

the other down regulated neuropeptide precursor, penk, encodes a  <dig> amino acid precursor of two penta peptides: met- and leu-enkephalin. enkephalins, compete with, and mimic the effect of opiate drugs, acting on opioid receptors in the brain. interestingly, it has been shown that hypocretin neurons expresses mu-opioid receptors  <cit> , and that the penk derivative -enkephalin , activates g-proteins in most rem-sleep related nuclei in the brain stem of rats  <cit>  and inhibits signalling of neurons in the amygdala  <cit> . also, another related opioid-like peptide, prodynorphin , has shown to co-localize with hcrt in the cells of the lateral hypothalamic area  <cit> , and was recently reported to have an inhibitory effect on hypocretin neurons  <cit> . furthermore, transgenic preproenkephalin-knockout female mice have shown to display altered emotional responses  <cit> , and altered expression of penk has been associated with the dyskinetic movement in parkinson patients  <cit> . taken together, all of these results suggest that the observed difference in penk transcripts also may be related to the behavioural and motor abnormalities seen in the narcoleptic dogs.

socs <dig>  shown in this study to be down-regulated in narcoleptic dog amygdala, belongs to a family of genes whose proteins acts as negative regulators in the jak/stat signaling pathway of cytokine responses  <cit> . cytokines produced by the immune system have previously been suggested to be involved in sleep regulation  <cit>  and increased levels of the cytokines tnf-α and il- <dig> have been reported in human narcoleptic plasma samples as compared to controls  <cit> . it is not known if the observed decrease in socs <dig> expression in the narcoleptic dogs may be associated with an increased cytokine response since an involvement of immunological component is obscure in the canine model of narcolepsy  <cit> . in addition to cytokine signaling, socs <dig> is also known to be induced by growth hormone  and to be a regulator of gh receptor signaling  <cit> . interestingly, human narcoleptic patients are reported having an altered gh secretion pattern  <cit>  and hypocretins are found to inhibit gh secretion in the brain cells of both rat and pig  <cit> . it is therefore possible to hypothesize that socs <dig> expression in narcoleptic dogs is affected by a similar action of gh secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
presently there is no cure for narcolepsy, and available treatments are purely symptomatic. patients suffering from severe daytime sleepiness are treated with amphetamine-like stimulants  to increase wakefulness, vigilance, and performance  <cit> . sleepiness in the canine narcolepsy model used in this study can also be improved with amphetamine-like stimulants  <cit> , and mice treated with amphetamine-like stimulants  increase their wake time  <cit> . interestingly, a single dose of methamphetamine  has shown to increase the expression of both tac <dig> and penk together with dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein of  <dig> kda  in the prefrontal cortex of mice  <cit> . since amphetamine and modafinil are thought to enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission for exhibiting their wake-promoting effects and since altered dopaminergic contents are reported in the brains of both human and canine narcolepsy  <cit> , it seems plausible that the activity of both of these genes is intimately connected to the extensive daytime sleepiness in several species. further functional characterization of tac <dig>  penk and socs <dig> in relationship to the deficiency of hypocretin signalling, as well as to the downstream effect and symptoms of the disease, will be an important future challenge. future research should also address the question as to whether the activity of these genes are modified in humans suffering from narcolepsy as well, possibly identifying common molecular alterations associated with similar symptoms.
