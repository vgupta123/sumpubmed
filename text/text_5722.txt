BACKGROUND
heat-related stress is a key concern for the poultry industry, especially with climate change and the expansion of poultry production into regions of the world that experience extreme temperatures  <cit> . heat-related stress occurs when a negative balance exists between the net energy released by a chicken into the environment, and the amount of heat energy produced  <cit> . this negative balance results in reduced feed consumption, digestion inefficiency, impaired metabolism, and death in broiler chickens . st. pierre et al.  <cit>  estimated the annual heat-related economic loss incurred by broiler, layer, and turkey producers in the u.s. to be approximately $125- <dig> million  <cit> . the annual heat-related losses incurred in the broiler sector alone were estimated at $ <dig>  million  <cit> . in the past few decades, genetic selection for broiler performance has resulted in remarkable improvements in growth rates  <cit> . the deleterious effects of high ambient temperature on growth rate are greater in broilers with higher growth rates than those with lower growth rates  <cit> . thus, understanding the genetic basis of the physiologic response to heat is critical for improved production efficiency and welfare of poultry.

few experiments reported to date have investigated the effects of heat on the transcriptome of chicken tissues  <cit> . li et al.  <cit>  investigated the transcriptome of broiler breast tissue in response to cyclic high ambient temperature   <cit> . of the  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in response to high ambient temperature, four  were novel heat-related stress genes. gene ontology analysis suggested involvement of the mitogen-associated protein kinase , ubiquitin-proteasome, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells  pathways in the response of broilers to high ambient temperature. exposing l <dig> taiwanese roosters to high ambient temperature  resulted in the up-regulation of  <dig> genes and the down-regulation of  <dig> genes in testis tissue  <cit> . these genes were primarily involved in response to stress, transport, signal transduction, and metabolism.

the objective of the current study is to characterize the effects of cyclic high ambient temperature on the transcriptome of a highly metabolically active organ in broiler chicks, the liver. this is the first reported study to use rna-seq to characterize the transcriptome of metabolic-related tissue in broilers exposed to high ambient temperature, thus providing novel insight into the effects of heat on metabolism in broilers. this information provides a platform for future investigations into the gene networks relevant to the production of commercial broilers resilient to the negative impacts of heat.

RESULTS
sequencing the transcriptome, aligning and mapping reads to the genome
approximately  <dig> million,  <dig> base pair single-end reads were generated using illumina hiseq  <dig> technology to sequence the cdna libraries. this yielded  <dig>  gigabases of total sequence and provided on average  <dig> , <dig> reads per sample. using the genomic short-read nucleotide alignment program   <cit> , 83% or more of the reads from each sample mapped back to the reference genome after alignment. full length , single-end reads were used for this analysis to preserve as much sequence information as possible.

counting mapped reads
on average, each sample had a total of  <dig> , <dig> uniquely mapped reads. of these reads,  <dig> , <dig> were classified as “no feature”, meaning that the reads could not be assigned to any feature in the genome. additionally,  <dig>  reads per sample were classified as ambiguous, meaning that the reads were assigned to multiple genomic features.

testing for differential expression and pathway analysis
forty genes were differentially expressed at a significance level of p-value <  <dig>  and a fold-change ≥  <dig> in response to cyclic high ambient temperature. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated. the fold-changes induced by high ambient temperature ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig>  . two gene networks were created from the ingenuity pathway analysis  of these genes: “cell signaling” and “endocrine system development and function”.table  <dig>

the “endocrine system development and function” network included aldo-keto reductase family  <dig>  member c <dig> , angiopoietin-like  <dig> , bradykinin receptor b <dig> , basonuclin  <dig>  isoform x <dig>  cholecystokinin , deiodinase, iodothyronine, type ii , deiodinase, iodothyronine, type iii , keratin  <dig> , myosin viia and rab interacting protein , platelet derived growth factor d , s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig> , s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig> , and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily c, member  <dig>  .to determine the biological pathways elicited in the liver by exposure of the birds to heat, the differentially expressed genes were categorized by function. cell signaling, endocrine system development and function, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry, and vitamin and mineral metabolism were the most significant functions elicited in response to heat .figure  <dig>

qpcr 
five up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were selected for qpcr analysis  . all samples represented in the rna-seq analysis, plus samples from  <dig> additional broilers exposed to the same treatments were included in the qpcr analysis, resulting in  <dig> samples per treatment. data from  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were in concordance between rna-seq and qpcr analyses. for  <dig> genes, the qpcr differential expression between groups was in agreement with the results of the rna-seq, and was significant. for an additional  <dig> genes, the relative ranking of the treatment means was the same for both qpcr and rna-seq, but the differences were not significant for qpcr. there was discordance between rna-seq and qpcr in the relative expression levels between the temperature treatments for only one of the nine genes .table  <dig>

discussion
the number of differentially expressed genes detected in the current study  is not high, which may be because of several factors. applying thresholds of both significance level and a minimum fold-change may have reduced the total number of genes that were declared as differentially expressed. using four replicates of full-sib pairs of heat-exposed and control chickens reduced random genetic variation between treatment groups, and therefore may have reduced the number of differentially expressed genes occurring at random. the low number of detected differentially expressed genes is not, however, likely to be attributable to the animal number because the sample number used in this experiment is comparable to other rna-seq experiments. wolf and bryk  <cit>  used four replicates of male and female chickens to study dosage compensation in chickens using rna-seq analysis; ayers et al.  <cit>  used two male and two female chickens to incorporate rna-seq analysis to examine the sexual dimorphic gene expression before gonadal differentiation. the method used to estimate the data variance determines the level of detection of differential expression in rna-seq data  <cit> . the current study has increased power to determine differential expression because of the advantages of the quasiseq package over other methods, such as deseq and edger.

the differential expression of two genes  from the “cell signaling” network and five genes  from the “endocrine system development and function” network indicate that birds use specific physiologic mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature in response to high ambient temperature. cck, dio <dig>  brcc <dig>  and fgf <dig> were up-regulated, while trpc <dig>  dio <dig>  and angptl <dig> were down-regulated. cck inhibits feed intake in chickens by promoting gastric emptying, stimulating the release of pancreatic digestive enzymes, and signaling the brainstem to depress appetite . during exposure to heat, animals experience a negative balance in the amount of heat energy released and produced  <cit> . the inhibition of feed intake may be a mechanism to reduce the additional heat that is produced from digestive metabolism. although the intestines are responsible for most of the body’s cck production, cck mrna expression has also been detected in the liver  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  suggested that transient receptor potential channels  are responsible for cellular cck signaling. the differential expression of trpc <dig> supports trpc involvement in cck signaling. dio <dig> and dio <dig> encode for members of an enzyme family, deiodinases, which is involved in thyroid hormone regulation  <cit> . silva  <cit>  demonstrated that thyroid hormone is involved in aerobic metabolism and thermal control. dio <dig> is involved in the preservation of thyroid hormone  <cit> , while dio <dig> is associated with the inactivation of thyroid hormone  <cit> . taken together, the contrasting regulation of dio <dig> and dio <dig> is predicted to decrease thyroid hormone levels. past studies have shown increases in hepatic dio <dig> mrna expression and activity levels in broilers after feed removal . the expression patterns of cck, trpc <dig>  dio <dig> and dio <dig> observed in the current study highlight a direct interaction between feed intake, deiodinase activity, and temperature regulation in response to the heat.

exposure to high ambient temperature results in a redistribution of blood flow from internal organs to peripheral tissues, reducing the internal temperature of chickens  <cit> . brcc <dig>  fgf <dig>  and angptl <dig> are all involved in regulation of blood vessel development . their differential expression, therefore, may be a host response to modulate internal temperature by regulating blood capillary development and distribution.

the differential expression of three genes  from the “cell signaling” network and myrip from the endocrine system development and function” network reflects a response to hyperthermia-induced apoptosis. scn3b, spon <dig>  and myrip were down-regulated, while ordml <dig> was up-regulated in response to heat. scn3b has been identified as a tp53-inducible proapoptotic gene in mouse embryonic cells  <cit> . the down-regulation of scn3b reduces the capability of apoptosis through the tp <dig> pathway. spon <dig> encodes for a secreted adhesion molecule that attaches to the extracellular matrix  of cells and inhibits amyloid β  precursor protein  cleavage into β-secretase . the cleavage of app results in amyloid β fibril formation, and induces apoptosis in yeast through mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> . in the current study, the down-regulation of spon <dig> may be a mechanism to return to homeostatic spon <dig> mrna levels following a transient up-regulation. haughey et al.  <cit>  suggested that amyloid β fibril accumulation occurs within the lipid rafts, which are specialized membrane domains mainly consisting of sphingolipids and cholesterol. ormdl <dig> belongs to a family of genes  that has been implicated in sphingolipid homeostasis  <cit> . in yeast, heat results in a transient accumulation of sphingolipid that can lead to apoptosis through sphingolipid signaling  <cit> . the up-regulation of ormdl <dig> reflects a cellular mechanism to regulate sphingolipid levels in response to heat, thus preventing apoptosis. myrip encodes for an actin motor that drives vesicle and organelle motility, and participates in endosome recycling  <cit> . the up-regulation of myrip may lead to enhanced ability of phagocytic cells to engulf and recycle the cellular particles after hyperthermia-induced apoptosis.

the down-regulation of three genes  from the “cell signaling” network reflects the latter stages of a host-regulated tissue repair response. as a liver proteoglycan, fmod regulates ecm organization by fibrogenic stimuli in mouse liver cells and has been described as essential for tissue repair  <cit> . hepatic fibrogenesis results from damage to hepatocytes by inflammatory reactions, which alter their ecm  <cit> . ruddell et al.  <cit>  suggested that hepatic fibrogenesis was enhanced by cross-talk between hepatic lipocytes and hepatic progenitor cells , resulting in chemotaxis and cell migration. as an adhesion g protein-coupled receptor , gpr <dig> is thought to participate in cell-to-cell and cell-matrix interactions  <cit> . trim <dig> participates in inflammation suppression, fibroblast migration, and lymphocyte chemotaxis in mouse embryo fibroblasts  <cit> .

the up-regulation of erc <dig> from the “cell signaling” network and the differential expression of three genes  from the “endocrine system development and function” network reflect a disruption in hepatocyte calcium levels in response to heat. erc <dig>  s100a <dig>  and bdkrb <dig> were all up-regulated, while s100a <dig> was down-regulated. erc <dig> encodes for a protein that localizes at voltage dependent calcium channels   <cit> . the s <dig> family of proteins function in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, cell growth and differentiation, protein phosphorylation, and the inflammatory response  <cit> . the differential expression of an s <dig> family member  and other genes involved in calcium-related transport and signaling was observed in catfish exposed to high ambient temperature  <cit> . texel and mattson  <cit>  reported that excess amyloid β fibril formation perturbed calcium homeostasis in mouse neuronal cells, possibly triggering apoptosis from calcium overload. bdkrb <dig> encodes for a bradykinin receptor that belongs to the rhodopsin-like gprs that function in the regulation of inflammation  <cit> . the activation of bdkrb <dig> increases cytosolic calcium levels  <cit> . the up-regulation of bdkrb <dig> is a component of an inflammatory response that contributes to perturbed cellular calcium levels. the up-regulation of erc <dig> and s100a <dig> represents calcium transport through calcium channels and calcium-dependent cellular signaling. the down-regulation of s100a <dig> may compensate for the calcium-related transport and signaling that is carried out by the proteins encoded by erc <dig> and s100a <dig>  the differential expression of erc <dig>  s100a <dig>  and s100a <dig> illustrates the dynamic mechanisms that regulate cellular calcium levels in response to heat.

in summary, the liver transcriptome of broilers exposed to high ambient temperature indicates specific host responses to decrease internal temperature, reduce hyperthermia-induced apoptosis, and promote tissue repair. additionally, differential expression occurred in genes that regulate the perturbed cellular calcium levels that result from exposure to heat.

CONCLUSIONS
cyclic high ambient temperature causes metabolic, physiologic, and cellular-level changes that can be characterized through rna-seq analysis of the liver transcriptome. the current findings suggest that these changes induce specific mechanisms by which broilers can reduce the negative physiologic effects of heat exposure. these novel insights into the effects of high ambient temperature on the metabolic transcriptome of broilers provide a foundation for future investigations into the gene networks involved in the response to heat, and for development of strategies to ameliorate the negative impacts of hot climates on animal welfare and productivity.
