BACKGROUND
brachial root avulsion is a type of injury that leads to motor function loss as a result of motoneuron degeneration. previous studies have shown that avulsion-induced motoneuron damage is propagated by a cascade of molecular and cellular events including changes in the expression of genes and the phosphorylation of signaling molecules in cell death-related pathways . based on the microarray analysis of the affected spinal cord after root avulsion in previous studies, the downregulation of genes required for promoting neuronal survival and axonal regeneration and the upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis and dna damage were observed. furthermore, our recent studies showed that some avulsion-induced genes, such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase , showed changes at the mrna level that were different from the changes at the protein levels  <cit> , whereas other changes, such as those in c-jun, were similar at the protein and mrna levels  <cit> . however, the upstream and downstream molecular mechanisms of avulsion-induced abnormal gene expression during motoneuron degeneration are still unclear and need to be studied further. micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that are key determinants of mrna stability  <cit> . mirnas modulate protein expression levels by antagonizing mrna translation and are powerful regulators of cellular function  <cit> . individual mirnas target and block hundreds of protein-coding genes  <cit>  that regulate many biological processes in neuronal lesions  <cit> . an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that mirnas in the spinal cord are altered in a variety of motor neuron degenerative diseases and after spinal cord injury . there is also emerging evidence that alterations in rna metabolism in the spinal cord are time-specific and may be critical in the progression of avulsion-induced motoneuron degeneration  <cit> . however, little is known regarding the mirna expression profile in the spinal cord during avulsion-induced motoneuron degeneration. therefore, we hypothesize that the use of mirnas may be an ideal and potent method for determining the underlying mechanism of avulsion-induced motoneuron death. in the present study, we investigated the mirna expression patterns based on the time course of motoneuron death by using microarray analysis followed by quantitative rt-pcr confirmation. we chose two time points,  <dig> and 14 days after avulsion, when the rna stability in the spinal cord was lost and when motoneuron death began to occur, respectively, to investigate the mirna expression patterns. furthermore, we focused on the changes in the mirna expression patterns in the ipsilateral vs. contralateral halves of the affected spinal cord. we employed bioinformatics analysis to determine the functional roles of target genes regulated by altered mirnas, which further suggested the effects of mirna dysregulation on the key processes of the brachial root avulsion injury.

RESULTS
microrna expression profiling of the injured rat spinal cord
in the present study,  <dig>  mirnas were expressed in the cervical spinal cord of the adult rats. after normalizing the signal intensities for all mirna expression levels, mir-124-3p, mir-9a-3p, mir-34a-5p, mir-9a-5p, mir-125b-5p, mir-let-7c-5p, mir-29a-3p, mir-23b-3p, mir-451-5p, and mir-30c-5p were the mirnas expressed at the highest levels . in the rats with right brachial plexus root avulsion, the mirna expression patterns of the ipsilateral spinal cord were significantly changed compared to those in the contralateral cervical spinal cord . ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion resulted in a sustained upregulation of  <dig> mirnas, including mir-19b-3p, mir-20b-5p, mir-21-5p, mir-27a-3p, mir-29b-3p, mir-106b-3p, mir-142-3p, mir-322-5p, mir- <dig>  and let-7a-5p . four of the mirnas, including mir-18a-3p, mir-293-3p, mir-501-5p, and mir-672-3p, were upregulated on the 3rd day but downregulated on the 14th day after the injury . only mir-466c-3p was continuously downregulated on both the 3rd and 14th days after the injury . furthermore,  <dig> of the mirnas, including mir-34b-3p, mir-25-3p, mir-126-5p, mir-142-5p, and mir-324-5p, were only transiently upregulated ; the other  <dig> mirnas, including mir-34a-3p and mir-324-5p, were transiently downregulated on the 3rd day but returned to normal levels by the 14th day . on the 14th day after injury,  <dig> mirnas, including mir-31a-3p, mir-17-5p, mir-146b-5p, mir-154-3p, and mir-363-3p, were upregulated , and  <dig> mirnas were downregulated, including mir-433-3p and mir-496-3p .figure  <dig>

to validate the above microarray results, we used qrt-pcr to confirm the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas. the qrt-pcr analysis confirmed that mir-146b-5p and mir-31a-3p were significantly upregulated in the ipsilateral spinal cord compared to the contralateral spinal cord on the 14th day after injury . the expression level of mir-466c-3p was downregulated on both the 3rd and the 14th days after injury . the expression levels of mir-376b-3p and mir-137-3p were downregulated, but mir-144-3p was upregulated on the 14th day compared to the 3rd day after injury .figure  <dig>

bioinformatics analyses of the mirna targets
according to the results of the mirnas microarray analysis, the mechanism of the ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion-induced changes in the mirna expression patterns were further explored by the gene ontology project, which was used to evaluate the genes affected by the upregulated and downregulated mirnas both in the early  stage and in the intermediate stage  after the injury. based on a cluster analysis of the enriched biological themes, the enrichment score is based on the mean value of the log of the p-values  for the members in that cluster. a cut-off value of  <dig>  was used, which corresponds to a p-value < <dig> . thus, a higher enrichment score value indicates a low p-value and therefore indicates that the cluster is significant  <cit> . the enriched clusters  related to the following processes were observed on both the 3rd day and 14th day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion: ion, amino acid and protein transport; response to organic substances; angiogenesis; cell migration; homeostatic processes; regulation of catalytic activity, phosphorylation and protein kinase cascades; activation of mapk activity; regulation of cell death and apoptosis; regulation of cell morphogenesis; neuron projection development and axonogenesis; and transmission of nerve impulses and synaptic transmission . enriched themes related to the inflammatory response involved on the 3rd day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion  and on the 14th day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion induced genes related to neurotransmitter transport and the regulation of the i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade .

additionally, we assessed these target genes with kegg terms. the pathways with p values <  <dig>  are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  in total,  <dig> pathways were significantly involved on both the 3rd and 14th days after injury, including the mapk, calcium and chemokine signaling pathways . apoptotic, p <dig> and t cell receptor signaling pathway responses on the 3rd day after injury  were observed, whereas on the 14th day after injury, the activation of the tgf-beta and gnrh signaling pathways was observed .

the predicted target genes of mir- <dig> and mir-324-3p, which were downregulated on the 14th day, indicate that they potentially targeted activating transcription factor  <dig> , growth associated protein- <dig>  and c-jun . caspase- <dig> was a potential target of the downregulated mir-376b-3p, calpain  <dig> was a potential target of the upregulated mir-199a-3p, and inos was a potential target of downregulated mir-291a-5p . while mir-142-5p and mir-219-5p were upregulated on the 3rd day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion, mir- <dig> and mir-199a-5p were upregulated on the 14th day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion and were predicted to target vglut <dig> table  <dig>

the expression patterns of altered mirna-targeted genes in injured spinal cord
subsequently, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses of target genes predicted by the altered mirnas were performed after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion . the activation of glial cells in the spinal cord was revealed by the inos, gfap, and nestin immunoreactivity on the 14th day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion . the increased expression of inos protein was observed in injured spinal segments , especially the ipsilateral half of the cervical spinal cord; most of the inos-positive glial cells were distributed widely both in the gray and white matter of the spinal cord . more obviously, gfap immunoreactivity was observed in the gray matter of the ipsilateral ventral horns surrounding the cell bodies of the motoneurons . the gfap-positive astrocytes were activated with remarkably larger cell bodies and short processes and were distributed in the peripheral circle of the white matter of the ipsilateral anterior and posterior funiculi . the ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion-induced nestin immunoreactivity within the spinal cord was concentrated in rexed ix layer of the gray matter and in the anterior and posterior funiculi, where the ventral and dorsal roots were localized, respectively . similarly, nestin-positive glial cells showed an excessively activated state and were spider-shaped with larger cell bodies and coarse and short processes in the ventral horn containing the lesion and the superficial layer of the dorsal horn . the akt/pkb signaling pathway was found to be involved in the glial activation after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion. both akt  and pi3k  were highly expressed in the glial cells in the bilateral ventral horns of the injured spinal segment. the caspase- <dig> immunoreactivity was absent in the contralateral ventral horn motoneurons  but was remarkably induced within the cytoplasm of the ipsilateral ventral horn motoneurons  on the 14th day after unilateral root avulsion. another member of the activating transcription factors, c-jun, was also highly expressed in the nuclei of the ipsilateral ventral horn motoneurons . the members of the activating transcription factor/camp-responsive element binding protein  family of transcription factors were induced and were expressed in the nuclei of the cells in the spinal cord . the creb protein was distributed in the nuclei of both motoneurons and glial cells in the bilateral ventral horns . however, the expression of atf- <dig> was only observed within the motoneurons of the ipsilateral ventral horns . ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion led to the dysfunction of both enzymes and the cytoskeletal reorganization of the injured motoneurons. ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion resulted in a clear decrease in the expression of calpain- <dig>  the calcium-dependent protease , in the ipsilateral ventral horn . the obvious induction of nnos was observed only in the ipsilateral ventral horn motoneurons . in the contralateral ventral horn motoneurons, the motoneuron marker  was detected in the cytoplasm of the motoneurons. ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion resulted in the disappearance of chat  in the ipsilateral motoneurons until the 14th day after the injury.figure  <dig>

on the 3rd and 14th days after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion, the survival of the motoneurons in both the ipsilateral and contralateral c <dig> ventral horns was investigated in neutral red-stained slides. the quantitative results showed that the ipsilateral c <dig> ventral horn contained  <dig>  ±  <dig> % as many surviving motoneurons as the contralateral c <dig> ventral horn on the 3rd day  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % on the 14th day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion.figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies have demonstrated that in a spinal root avulsion injury model, the up-regulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase  coincides with the death of spinal motoneurons  <cit> , and the upregulation of c-jun coincides with the regeneration of spinal motoneurons  <cit> . furthermore, the peak expression of nnos induced by ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion in the ipsilateral ventral horn motoneurons occurred from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  <cit> , whereas the expression of c-jun activated by ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion peaked between 12 h and  <dig> d  <cit> . given the time course of gene changes and the death of motoneurons, 3 days and 14 days were chosen as the time points for exploring mirna dysregulation after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion.

we compared our results to published data from several microarray studies of spinal cord injury. these comparisons revealed that the highly expressed mirnas from our study were also reported in the study by timo brandenburger et al.  <cit> ; they showed that mir- <dig>  the let- <dig> family and mir-34b-3p belonged to the group of highly expressed mirnas in the rat spinal cord. these highly expressed mirnas may be the result of the alteration of different cell populations. this alteration could explain the down-regulation of the neuron-specific mirna, mir- <dig>  <cit> ; similarly, astrocyte activation upon injury might be a consequence of the up-regulation of mir- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, immune cell infiltration might be related to the down-regulation of mir-181a expression  <cit> .

we also observed good agreement between the present results and the data from nai-kui liu et al.  <cit>  in the mirna expression pattern. of the  <dig> mirnas they found upregulated in traumatic spinal cord injury, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-20b-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-146a, mir-199a-3p, mir-221-3p, mir-146b, and mir- <dig> were also upregulated in our study, and among the  <dig> downregulated mirnas in traumatic spinal cord injury, mir-34a and mir- <dig> were also downregulated after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion in our study.

furthermore, we investigated gene expression on the 3rd day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion reported in yang's study  <cit> , which showed decreased expression of the genes that are known to facilitate neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. based on our research, mir- <dig>  which was downregulated on the 3rd day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion, was shown to modulate axonal regeneration through the target gap- <dig> gene.

brachial plexus avulsion also leads to severe intractable neuropathic pain. when both the dorsal and ventral roots are injured, reproducible pain-related behavior in animal models of radiculopathy can be reproduced . we found that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were upregulated in the ipsilateral ventral horn after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion. this result is consistent with the study by bin yu et al., who showed that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were upregulated in the dorsal root ganglia after resection of the sciatic nerve in rats  <cit> . the study by yuuki genda et al. also revealed that certain mirnas, including mir- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  were related to neuropathic pain in a chronic constriction injury rat model  <cit> .

furthermore, we also identified the target gene that is related to neuropathic pain mediated by the altered mirnas after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion. the predicted target gene of downregulated mir-291a-5p was inducible nitric oxide synthase . subsequently, the expression of inos, gfap and nestin were detected in the spinal cord on the 14th day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion. a c5-t <dig> ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion injury results in the significant activation of microglia and astrocytes in the peripheral circle of the white matter of the ipsilateral anterior and posterior funiculi. deafferentation clearly influenced the extent of microglial activity in the spinal cord, most likely as a result of partial damage to the spinal cord from ventral root avulsion combined with dorsal root avulsion  <cit> . microglial activation also occurred in the contralateral spinal cord; d. j. chew  <cit>  has attributed this effect to transneuronal collateral mechanisms or ‘reactivity overspill’, which are the most dominant hypotheses  <cit> .

some studies have reported that the dorsal root lesion alone results in a series of gene changes including not only astroglial and microglial reaction but also the loss of vesicular glutamate transporter  <dig>  inputs. dorsal root avulsion disrupted the primary afferents to the spinal motoneurons, which resulted in glutamatergic input lesions. llewellyn-smith ij et al. showed that the transection reduced the density of vglut1-immunoreactive axons in sympathetic subnuclei  <cit> . the loss of vglut <dig> also occurred following dorsal rhizotomy  <cit> . in addition, vglut <dig> immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of the l6-s <dig> of the spinal cord also decreased following lumbosacral ventral root avulsion  <cit> . we propose that the dorsal root avulsion-induced loss of vglut <dig> might also contribute to the mirna alterations in the present study. in the present study, by using the mirwalk database, we determined that the following altered mirnas target the vglut <dig> gene: mir-142-5p, mir-219-5p, mir- <dig> and mir-199a-5p. mir-142-5p and mirna-219-5p, which were upregulated on the 3rd day; and mir- <dig> and mir-199a-5p, which were upregulated on the 14th day. the upregulation of the above mirnas might result in the downregulation of vglut <dig> gene expression in the injured spinal cord.

a single mirna can act on various mrnas, and an mrna can also be regulated by multiple mirnas. thus, the significance of mirna dysregulation could be better understood by investigating the complex pathways in which they are involved  <cit> . the biological analysis of altered mirnas revealed that the important themes that were affected in both the early and intermediate stages of the injury were related to cell death; synaptic transmission; ion, amino acid and protein transport; regulation of catalytic activity, phosphorylation and the protein kinase cascade.

the data in the study by marten risling et al.  <cit>  suggest that the inflammatory response is more prominent 24 h after animals are subjected to avulsion. our data also suggest that the inflammatory response was more prominent in the early stage of the injury and that the t cell receptor signaling pathway was involved on the 3rd day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion. in t lymphocytes, the serine/threonine kinase akt   is activated upon t-cell receptor activation or in response to an active form of phosphatidylinositide  3-kinase  <cit> . activated akt/pkb then suppresses the generation of regulatory t cells  <cit> . however, immunofluorescence showed that ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion induced little change in the expression of akt and pi3k in the spinal segment and that both akt and pi3k were highly expressed in the glial cells in the bilateral ventral horns of the injured spinal segment on the 14th day. moreover, downstream of pi3k/akt, caspase  <dig> was substantially increased in the cytoplasm of the ipsilateral ventral horn motoneurons, consistent with neuronal death  <cit> . the increase in caspase  <dig> was consistent with its predicted mirna, mir-376b-3p, which was downregulated on the 14th day compared to the 3rd day after avulsion.

the pathway most involved on the 14th day after injury was the gnrh signaling pathway. the gnrh receptor activates phospholipase c, which transmits its signal to diacylglycerol  and inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate . then, dag activates the intracellular protein kinase c  pathway, leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases , and ip <dig> stimulates the release of intracellular calcium. both the mapk and calcium signaling pathways were consistently activated  <dig> or more days after injury. as members of the mapk family, erk1/ <dig> and jnk participate in neuronal survival, regeneration, development and death . erk1/ <dig> may involve the activation of creb  <cit> , which was distributed in the nuclei of both motoneurons and glial cells in the bilateral ventral horns. however, a member of the atf/creb family of transcription factors, atf <dig>  was only observed in the nuclei of the motoneurons in the ipsilateral ventral horns. the present study found that the downregulated mir- <dig> and mir-324-3p on the 3rd day after injury potentially targeted atf <dig>  moreover, atf- <dig> regulates transcription by binding to dna sites as a homodimer or heterodimer with jun proteins  <cit> . some studies have shown that atf- <dig> enhanced c-jun-mediated neurite formation in pc <dig> and neuro-2a neuronal cell lines  <cit>  and in ngf-deprived neonatal superior cervical ganglion neurons  <cit> . the phosphorylation of the ap- <dig> protein c-jun on ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> by jnk causes increased transcriptional activity  <cit> . in addition, c-jun is one of the earliest and most consistent markers of neurons that respond to nerve-fiber transection, and its expression can be related to both degeneration and survival including target re-innervation  <cit> . in our previous studies, we found altered jnk/c-jun gene expression in avulsion-injured spinal cord  <cit> , and after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion, c-jun was highly expressed in the nuclei of the ipsilateral ventral horn motoneurons. the predicted target genes further illustrated that the avulsion-induced downregulation of mir-324-3p might be the upstream molecular trigger of the jnk/c-jun pathway because mir-324-3p negatively modulates the c-jun gene.

another pathway, the ca2+/calmodulin dependent signaling pathway, is involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and dendritic morphology  <cit>  as well as the pathological process of neuronal cell death  <cit> . both calpain and nnos belong to ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes  <cit> . calpain has been implicated in neuronal injury, and nnos is proteolytically cleaved by calpain  <cit> . although no mirna in our study was predicted to target nnos, we found that the upregulated mir-199a-3p on the 14th day after injury potentially targeted calpain  <dig>  and the immunohistochemistry results showed that ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion resulted in a clear decrease in the expression of calpain  <dig>  in addition, neurotransmitter transport was observed on the 14th day after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion, and many previous studies have shown that mirnas may regulate specific neurotransmitter systems  <cit> . for instance, the overexpression and knockdown of mir-181a in primary neurons revealed the effectiveness of mir-181a in the regulation of the glur <dig> subunit of the ampa receptor  <cit> , a key factor in synaptic plasticity. dopaminergic receptors can also be regulated by mir-142-3p. using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, it was shown that the post-transcriptional regulation of the d <dig> receptor is specifically mediated by mir-142-3p  <cit> .

in addition, based on comparisons of the ipsilateral ventral horn to the contralateral ventral horn on the 3rd and 14th days after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion, the number of upregulated mirnas decreased, whereas the number of downregulated mirnas remained constant, unlike in some other studies. in contusion sci models in rats, as the injury response progressed, the number of mirnas that were downregulated gradually increased, whereas the number of upregulated mirnas did not change significantly  <cit> . a similar conclusion was drawn by strickland et al.  <cit> , who reported that the number of downregulated mirnas was higher on day  <dig> than on day  <dig> post-injury. these observed differences in mirna expression between studies might be the result of different injury types and severity. because decreased gene expression was greatest after severe injury  <cit> , extravertebral ventral root avulsion combined with dorsal root avulsion limited the damage outside of the vertebral lamina, but the damage was not as severe as central spinal cord injury. therefore, the extent of decreased mirna expression induced by ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion was not substantially altered.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we explored mirna expression profiles using a brachial ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion injury model and described the pattern of mirna expression following spinal cord injury. the mirna expression changes in this study were consistent with previous studies, although discrepancies existed. the present data revealed previously unknown time-specific alterations of a large set of mirnas in the spinal cord after ventral combined with dorsal root avulsion. the altered mirna target genes encode components involved in inflammation at the beginning of injury and mapk and calcium signaling pathway components at the start of motoneuron death. our results indicate that the alterations in mirnas may contribute to the mechanism of injured motoneuron degeneration. the manipulation of the altered mirnas before the start of motoneuron death within 2 weeks in adult rats might be a useful and reliable strategy for inhibiting the subsequent apoptosis and promoting axonal regenerative processes in the treatment of brachial root avulsion.
